A great deal of\\nher history is undisputed.  She is the daughter of a Gurkha soldier,\\nKumarsing Rai. The appellant\\'s father served in the Gurkha Brigade of\\nBritish Army from 1962 until 1972.  Sadly, in 2000 the appellant\\'s father\\ndied.\\n\\nUnder the policy introduced in 2009 providing for a correction of the\\nhistoric injustice to those who served in the army as Gurkhas, the\\nappellant\\'s mother came to the UK in 2015.\\n\\nOn 20 July 2017 the appellant applied for entry clearance to join her\\nmother in the UK.  The application was refused on 29 August 2018.  An Entry\\nClearance Manager\\'s Review on 18 February 2019 maintained the refusal.  On\\n10 October 2018 the appellant gave notice of an appeal.\\n\\nAs above, in a decision dated 15 October 2019, First-tier Tribunal Judge\\nRowlands refused the appeal. The First-tier Tribunal found that the\\nappellant did not have a family life with her mother. The reasons for this\\nconclusion were set out in paragraphs 17 to 19:\\n\\n         \"17. I have considered all of the evidence in the case including\\n             that to which I do not specifically refer and reach the\\n             following conclusion.  There seems to be little dispute over\\n             the facts of this case.  The Appellant is a 32-year old,\\n             unmarried, unemployed female who lives with her sister and\\n             brother in the family home in Nepal.  She has no income, they\\n             all live rent-free and survive on their mother\\'s widow\\'s\\n             pension from the British Army following the death of their\\n             father, a former Gurkha.  I am told that none of the children\\n             are employed.  This appeal relates to the eldest only.\\n\\n18.  Their circumstances are not good in a material sense.  They live in a\\nsmall property which seems very isolated.  This is what they have been used\\nto all their lives.  Their mother occupies one room in a property in the\\nUnited Kingdom and works part-time as a cleaner.  She is 64 years of age\\nand has little spare income, she is not a well woman and sends such money\\nas she can back to her adult children.  They live in the countryside and\\nhave a cow and some chickens and land to tend.  I am not sure in most\\nsenses who is the better off but the question is does she have family life\\nwith her mother such as would engage Article 8.\\n\\n19.  I am told that they communicate as much as they can by phone or\\ninternet although I have been provided with some evidence of this all of it\\nis in Nepalese and I can\\'t read it.  It seems to me quite common that\\nparents and children would communicate in such a way.  I am told that the\\nAppellant gets upset when they speak which is perhaps to be expected\\nbecause of the separation from her mother.  I believe her family life must\\nof course be mainly with her siblings, after all they live together on a\\ndaily basis.  Their mother is far away.  The Appellant must get her\\nemotional support from her siblings and I do not believe that they have\\nproved that her family life with her mother is more than that which would\\nbe expected of adult children separated from their mother by choice or\\notherwise.  I am not satisfied that her family life is such that it would\\nengage Article 8.  For these reasons I do not consider that I need to\\nconsider the historical injustice.\"\\n\\nThe appellant brings two main grounds of appeal against the decision of the\\nFirst-tier Tribunal.  Firstly, she argues that the First-tier Judge applied\\nan incorrect test when assessing whether family life existed between her\\nand her mother.  Secondly, the appellant maintains that the First-tier\\nTribunal failed to take into account material evidence in that assessment\\nand took into account immaterial factors.\\n\\nThe appellant maintains that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did not set out\\nthe correct self-direction in law as to how to assess family life\\nconcerning an adult child and a parent in the context of a Gurkha family as\\nset down by the Court of Appeal in Rai v ECO Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320.\\nThe key ratio in Rai had been brought to the attention of the First-tier\\nTribunal in the skeleton argument dated 9 June 2019 which indicated in\\nparagraph 2 that the question that the judge had to answer was:\\n\\n\"1)  Is there support between the Appellant and the sponsor which is real,\\nor effective or committed (Rai v ECO Delhi [2017] EWCA Civ 320 at paragraph\\n36 per Lindblom LJ).\"\\n\\nIt was my conclusion that there was merit in this aspect of the appellant\\'s\\nchallenge.  As the judge indicates in paragraph 17 of the decision, there\\nwas \"little dispute over the facts of this case\".  The facts were therefore\\nthat the appellant was a 32 year old unmarried unemployed woman living with\\nher sister and brother, having done so all of her life in the family home\\nin Nepal.  The home was owned by her mother.  She had no income at all\\nother than what her mother was able to provide from her own income.  The\\nappellant\\'s mother\\'s evidence at paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 indicated that\\nhaving learned of the settlement rights for widows of Gurkha nationals, she\\ntook the decision to come to the UK alone \"after much deliberation\" and\\nhoped that her children could come shortly afterwards.  In paragraph 12 the\\nsponsor\\'s evidence was that it was \"never my intention to leave any of the\\nchildren behind\" and that the separation occurred only because she did not\\nhave sufficient funds to apply for the children to join her sooner.  The\\nsponsor\\'s evidence, consistent with that of the applicant, was also that\\nshe had \"been constantly in contact with the children and helping them with\\nmoney from the UK\".\\n\\nIn my view, these parts of the evidence, at least, were capable of meeting\\nthe test in Rai as to there being family life because of \"dependence\"\\nconsisting of \"real\", \"effective\" or \"committed\" support but the First-tier\\nTribunal did not take them into account when finding that there was no\\nfamily life.  The assessment that was required, was not merely to look for\\nmore than usual emotional ties, as suggested for the Secretary of State\\nbefore me. The assessment also proceeded on the basis that if the appellant\\nhad a family life with her siblings then this displaced or reduced the\\nlikelihood of family life with her mother. It was not clear to me that this\\napproach was supported by authority or, in the context of the Gurkha\\nfamilies affected by the historical injustice, was appropriate.\\n\\nFurther, I also accepted that the decision on family life did not take into\\naccount potentially material aspects of the evidence, for example whether\\nthe straitened circumstances in which the appellant lived and complete\\ndependence on her mother for material support might impact on continuing\\nfamily life with her mother, the mother\\'s dilemma in applying for entry\\nclearance for herself without her children being able to do so at the same\\ntime and the appellant\\'s distress when speaking to her mother which the\\njudge accepted was likely to be because they were separated.\\n\\nIt was therefore my conclusion that both of the appellant\\'s grounds of\\nappeal had merit and that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal had to be\\nset aside.\\n\\nThe parties made submissions on the appropriate disposal in the event of an\\nerror of law being found.  The respondent considered that the matter had to\\nbe remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  The appellant maintained that the\\nmaterials were sufficient for a decision to be remade in the Upper Tribunal\\nand in the event that this was not considered to be the case, the matter\\nshould be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.\\n\\nIt was my conclusion that where the assessment of family life here has to\\nbe a careful and holistic one given the particular circumstances of this\\nseparated Gurkha family, this had to be done de novo in the First-tier\\nTribunal.  It is also the case that there has been no assessment of\\nproportionality at all where the First-tier Tribunal did not find there to\\nbe a family life.  In those circumstances, it is appropriate for the matter\\nto be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal de novo in line with paragraph 7\\nof Part 3 of the Senior President\\'s Practice Statement dated 25 September\\n2012.\\n\\nThe attention of the First-tier Tribunal is drawn to the extant appeal of\\nthe appellant\\'s sister in appeal HU/12475/2019 and to the indication made\\nbefore me that appellant will be making an application for the appeals to\\nbe joined and heard together.\\n\\nDecision\\n\\n\\nThe decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on a point of\\nlaw and is set aside to be remade de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.\\n\\n\\nSigned: S Pitt                                   Date: 2 August 2021\\nUpper Tribunal Judge Pitt\\n\\n'}\n"
