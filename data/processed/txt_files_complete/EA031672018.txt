                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


                 DECISION MADE PURSUANT TO RULES  39 OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1. Rule 39 permits the Upper Tribunal to make a consent  order  disposing
      of proceedings.  I am satisfied that it should do so in this  case  as
      both parties have agreed to this on the terms set out in the  attached
      order.  A copy of the order is attached.




      Notice of Decision

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and is set aside.

   2. By consent, the appeal is allowed to the extent that on the  basis  of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Povey's findings,  regulation  8(2)  of  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 is satisfied, for the  reasons  set
      out in the Respondent's skeleton argument dated 12 August 2019.

      Signed                       Date: 13 September 2019
