     DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER
                            TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant, a citizen of DRC, appealed to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    ("FtT") against a decision dated 18 April 2019 to refuse  a  protection
    and human rights claim. The FtT dismissed the appellant's appeal.

 2. At the hearing before me on 13 November 2019 it was agreed between  the
    parties that the grounds of appeal in relation to  the  FtT's  decision
    reveal that it erred in law.

 3. It was also agreed between the parties that the errors of law are  such
    as to require the decision of the FtT to  be  set  aside  and  for  the
    appeal to be remitted to the FtT for a hearing de novo.

 4. In the circumstances, I set aside the decision of the FtT for error  of
    law and remit the appeal to the FtT for  a  hearing  de  novo,  on  all
    grounds, before a judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge  Andonian,
    with no findings of fact preserved.

 5. In remitting the appeal I have had  regard  to  paragraph  7.2  of  the
    Practice Statement of the Senior President of Tribunals.

 6. Pursuant to rule 40(3)(a) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the  decision
    being made with the consent of the parties.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
