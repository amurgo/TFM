                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellants are citizens of Ukraine. The first appellant was born
       on 30th August 1969 and the second appellant on 27th June 1964. They
       are married. They say that they came to the UK  in  1996,  and  have
       remained in the UK unlawfully since that time  without  leaving  the
       country. On 6th July 2012  they  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
       remain on the basis of  their  long  residence  in  accordance  with
       paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules as in force  at  that  time.
       Their applications were  refused  on  13th  November  2013  and  the
       appellants  appealed  on  2nd  December  2013.  Their  appeals  were
       dismissed in a  determination  promulgated  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Lingam on 16th July 2014. Permission to  appeal  against  this
       decision was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  JM  Holmes
       on 6th October 2014. I found that Judge Lingam had erred in law  and
       set  her  determination  aside  in  its  entirety  in   a   decision
       promulgated on 12th November 2014. The reasons for that decision are
       set out at annex A to this decision.

    2. The matter came back before me to re-make the appeal. The issues  in
       this appeal are whether the appellants can meet the requirements  of
       paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules as it stood at the  time  of
       their applications or failing that  if  they  can  show  that  their
       removal would be a breach of Article 8 ECHR. The burden of proof  is
       on the appellants and  they  must  demonstrate  on  the  balance  of
       probabilities that they can fulfil the Immigration  Rules,  or  that
       their removal would constitute a real risk of a violation  of  their
       protected human rights.

 The Refusal

    3. In summary the Secretary of State says that  the  appellants  cannot
       show they meet the requirements of paragraph 276B of the Immigration
       Rules or qualify  to  remain  in  accordance  with  Article  8  ECHR
       because:

    . The second  appellant  had  submitted  insufficient  evidence  of  his
      residence between 1996 and 2006. His residence in this period was only
      supported by an  employer's  letter  covering  1996  to  2000.  It  is
      therefore only believed that he has been  resident  in  the  UK  since
      2006.

    . The first appellant had also submitted insufficient  evidence  of  her
      residence between 1996 and 2012 (there were only letters of employment
      between 1996 and 1999 & 2002 and 2005, 5 employee references for  2005
      to 2010, and money transfers in the name of Maria German between  2005
      and 2010) and so it is only believed that she has been resident in the
      UK since 2012.

    . It would not be a breach of Article 8 ECHR to return the appellants to
      Ukraine because  they  could  not  show  they  fulfilled  any  of  the
      Immigration Rules relating to Article 8; had  lived  the  majority  of
      their lives in Ukraine and had not severed all ties with that country.



Evidence - Remaking

    4. The full account of the evidence  is  set  out  in  the  statements/
       letters of the five witnesses and the  record  of  proceedings.  The
       appellants gave their evidence through  the  Ukrainian  interpreter,
       whom they confirmed they understood. The other  witnesses  all  gave
       their evidence in English. In summary the appellants say  that  they
       both entered the UK illegally in 1996 to look for work as they  were
       struggling to support their family in Ukraine. They have  worked  in
       the UK since this time, and provided  employers  letters,  payslips,
       photographs of themselves in their work uniforms and for  the  later
       period HMRC documentation for the second appellant.  They  have  not
       returned  to  Ukraine  during  this  time.  They  have   also   made
       friendships  with  British  citizens,  and  have  provided   letters
       confirming their residence from these friends.

    5. The witness Ms Sarah Ellard states  that  the  first  appellant  has
       cleaned for her every week since approximately 2006 when  she  moved
       to her current property. The witness Ms Louise Scagnelli states that
       she has seen the first and second  appellants  on  a  regular  basis
       (between one and four times  a  month  at  the  weekend,  mostly  on
       Sundays) in her cafï¿½ as customers and then as  a  friend  since  the
       spring of 2000. She is certain that this was the time  she  met  the
       appellant as it was just after the death of her father in 1999.  The
       witness Ms Sharon Davies states that she has been friends  with  the
       appellants since 1998. She is clear in her memory that it  was  this
       time as her daughter was two years old and  she  had  to  return  to
       work, with the first appellant initially being with her in her  home
       doing child-care  for  the  first  eight  or  nine  years  of  their
       friendship (so until about 2008/2009), when  her  daughter  went  to
       secondary school. Since then the first appellant has helped her with
       household matters such as shopping. She is certain  that  the  first
       appellant has not left the UK as she has talked  about  missing  her
       sons and not having the opportunity to go back and see them.

    6. In addition to the witness evidence I have taken into  consideration
       the large bundle of documentary evidence supplied by the  appellants
       and  the  respondent's  bundles   which   contained   the   original
       application  forms,  immigration  status   questionnaires,   refusal
       letters, immigration decision notices and notices of appeal.

Submissions

    7. Mr Walker relied upon the refusal letter. He said that he found  all
       the witnesses credible and accepted that Mrs  Davies  had  therefore
       corroborated the fact that the appellants had been in the  UK  since
       1998. He accepted that the evidence of the second appellant was that
       he had worked cash in hand prior to 2006.

    8. Mr Seelhoff submitted that he  relied  upon  his  skeleton  argument
       given Mr Walkers concession about the  credibility  of  the  witness
       evidence.  In his skeleton argument Mr Seelhoff states that the only
       issue in dispute under paragraph 276B of the  Immigration  Rules  is
       showing the appropriate length of residence. The first appellant has
       passed her life in the UK test and  the  second  appellant  provided
       suitable evidence from an educational psychologist that he is unable
       to learn English due to a traffic accident, and that this appears to
       be accepted by the respondent as  exempting  him  from  the  English
       language requirement. Mr Seelhoff submits that there are  employment
       letters and there is witness evidence which show the appellants have
       been in the UK since 1996. The witnesses are all  British  citizens;
       are not related to the appellants; and have attended the Tribunal on
       three  occasions  to  confirm  their  long  friendships   with   the
       appellants  and  support  their  appeal.  No  documents  have   been
       challenged by the Secretary of State as forgeries.

    9. At the end of the hearing I informed the appellants that I  accepted
       their period of claimed  residence  on  the  basis  of  the  witness
       evidence I had heard and documents in support. As a result  I  would
       be allowing their appeal, but that my full reasons would  follow  in
       writing.

Findings - Re-making

   10. The appellants contend that they meet the requirements of  paragraph
       276B of the Immigration Rules as it stood at the time of application
       on the basis that they could meet requirements at 276B(i)(b) as they
       had been resident for 14  years  or  more;  because  there  were  no
       reasons why it was undesirable for them  to  be  granted  indefinite
       leave to remain in accordance with paragraph 276B(ii); because  they
       had no unspent convictions in accordance with paragraph 276B  (iii);
       and because the first appellant had sufficient English and knowledge
       about life in the UK and the second appellant had submitted suitable
       documentation to show that this was not possible due to his  medical
       problems and so they could thus meet the requirements  of  paragraph
       276B(iv).

   11. The respondent  has  only  contended  that  appellants  are  not  so
       entitled due to concerns with the appellants' length of residence. I
       am satisfied,  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  set  out  in  ZH
       (Bangladesh) v SSHD  [2009] EWCA Civ 8, that the appellants can show
       that there are no reasons in the public interest which would make it
       undesirable to grant them indefinite leave to remain. There is  also
       no evidence before me that shows the appellants  have  any  criminal
       convictions, let alone any that are unspent.

   12. I am also satisfied that  the first appellant submitted  a  relevant
       ESOL qualification as this is indicated on her application  form  as
       having been provided to the respondent; her certificates  form  part
       of the appellants' bundle and no submissions/ allegations have  been
       made that  they  are  not  satisfactory  by  the  respondent.  I  am
       satisfied that the second appellant is properly to be seen as exempt
       from this requirement as he has provided the report of  a  qualified
       educational psychologist, Mr T Francis. I find Mr Francis to  be  an
       appropriately qualified expert who has written a careful  report  in
       which he sets out his expertise and  the  methodology  by  which  he
       reaches his conclusions. Mr Francis concludes that  due  to  a  very
       severe car accident when he was 22 years old (so in 1986 whilst  the
       appellants still lived in Ukraine)  the  second  appellant  suffered
       damage to the areas of the brain that deal with the  acquisition  of
       new skills, including languages, and that as a result despite  being
       a man of high academic potential there is no meaningful  possibility
       he would be able to pass a citizenship  examination  which  involved
       with learning of new materials using memory, language  and  literacy
       skills.

   13. Mr Walker has conceded for the respondent that the witness  evidence
       before the Tribunal was credible. I am also satisfied  that  is  the
       case. All the witnesses answered questions  put  to  them  directly;
       their evidence was consistent with their  written  statements,  with
       each other, and with the other documentary materials supplied.

   14. Paragraph 276B (i)(b) of the Immigration Rules requires at least  14
       years of continuous residence prior to  the  service  of  a  removal
       notice. The appellants received  their  removal  decisions  on  21st
       November 2013, so the fourteen  year  period  would  start  on  21st
       November 1999.

   15. I am satisfied that the appellants have been resident for  a  period
       of more than 14 years at the date of service of  removal  notice  on
       the basis of the credible witness  evidence  from  Ms  Davies  which
       starts from 1998 and from Ms  Scagnelli  which  commences  from  the
       Spring of 2000. Both witnesses  confirm  the  appellants'  residence
       from those points to the current day, giving good reasons for  their
       certainty about the start dates for their friendships. Ms Davies  is
       able to confirm the first appellant's  residence  on  weekdays  from
       1998 to approximately 2008, and then from time to  time  thereafter.
       She is a close friend of the appellants and was  certain  that  they
       had not left the UK as she knew how much the first appellant  missed
       her sons and how she had said she was unable to travel to see  them.
       Ms Scagnelli has seen the appellants in her cafï¿½  as  customers  and
       then friends at weekends between once a month and once a week  since
       the spring of 2000. This witness evidence is also supported by other
       documentary evidence as set out below.

   16. The second appellant has a letter from the company he says  employed
       him between September 1996 and 2000 as a building labourer for Field
       Starkey Building Co Ltd. There is evidence from Companies House that
       this  was  indeed  a  general  construction  and  civil  engineering
       company, which was incorporated in 1997 and went out of business  in
       2009.  The first appellant has said that on arrival  in  the  UK  in
       1996 until 1999 she worked for  the  Crowne  Plaza  Hotel,  and  has
       produced a letter confirming this.  Both  appellants  maintain  that
       they were only paid in cash for this work, and got the work  through
       friends, and so there is no further documentary  evidence  of  there
       presence during this period. The letter from  Field  Starkey  states
       that they paid the second appellant's tax  and  national  insurance,
       but in fact  this  was  not  the  case,  however  given  the  second
       appellant's lack of ability to read the letter  (which  was  clearly
       meant as an onward reference as it was issued in 2000 soon after  he
       had finished with the company) and the potential for the company  to
       desire to appear to have acted properly I  do  not  find  that  this
       inconsistency invalidates the evidence  of  the  appellant  that  he
       worked for this company.

   17. Between 2000 and 2004 the second appellant says he did a variety  of
       casual work  including  delivering  pizzas,  handing  out  leaflets,
       gardening and  manual  labour.  Between  1999  and  2005  the  first
       appellant was a cleaner, and has provided  a  letter  from  Mr  Mark
       Shuttleworth confirming this was the case, as well as working for Ms
       Davies doing child-care and household work. Clearly  this  work  was
       all "cash in hand". Neither appellant attended a doctor  or  dentist
       during this time and they used international calling cards  to  keep
       in touch with family in Ukraine. I find it is highly plausible  that
       they lived in this way, and given the  supporting  witness  evidence
       regarding their continuous presence in the UK during this period and
       the first appellant's work for Mrs Davies, I find on the balance  of
       probabilities that they did so.

   18. Between 2002 and 2005  the  first  appellant  says  she  worked  for
       Hotelcare Ltd and has produced a letter from this company confirming
       that she was a room attendant at the Jury's Inn  Hotel  in  Chelsea.
       There is evidence from Companies House which  shows  that  Hotelcare
       Ltd existed as a private  limited  company  from  1992.  The  second
       appellant says he worked  for  the  same  hotel  from  2004.  It  is
       conceded by the respondent that the second appellant has been in the
       UK since 2006 on the basis of his work for this company  who  placed
       him on the payroll in that year. There are also photographs of  both
       appellants clearly wearing the uniforms  of  this  hotel  with  work
       colleagues in the same uniforms. I am satisfied that the  appellants
       both worked for Hotelcare Ltd as they have claimed.

   19. The  credible  witness  evidence  of  Ms  Ellard  places  the  first
       appellant in the UK on the basis of the weekly cleaning of her  home
       since 2006. There is also  a  letter  from  the  Ukrainian  Catholic
       Cathedral which says that the appellants have both  been  in  weekly
       attendance at the cathedral for mass since  July  2006.   There  are
       also letters from three other employers who confirm that  the  first
       appellant has been their cleaner starting variously  in  2005,  2007
       and 2008. The appellants' landlord from 2010 to 2014 also  wrote  to
       confirm their period of tenancy and provided a reference  for  them;
       and there is a letter from the Ukrainian community centre dated 2011
       which confirms both appellants as members who  actively  participate
       in their functions.  It is of course conceded by the respondent that
       the first appellant has been present since 2012.

   20. On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied that  the  appellants
       have been continuously present  in  the  UK  since  1996  given  the
       totality of the evidence presented to the Tribunal,  and  thus  that
       they had been in the UK for a continuous  period  of  more  than  14
       years at the point of service of the removal decision.  As a  result
       they qualify for indefinite leave to remain under paragraph 276B  of
       the Immigration Rules.

   21. As I have found that they qualify for  leave  to  remain  under  the
       Immigration Rules I will deal  with  Article  8  ECHR  briefly.  The
       appellants have extensive private life ties in the UK as  they  have
       work, friends, church and  community  group  connections  with  this
       country, and these would be interfered with were they to be removed.
       This interference would not be in accordance with the law as I  have
       found that they are entitled to remain under the Immigration  Rules.







Decision

   22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

   24. The decision is re-made allowing the appeals under  the  Immigration
       Rules.



Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley
13th December 2014


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make  a  fee  award.  I  have
    decided to make no fee award as I was not  asked  to  do  this  by  the
    appellant's representative and I  find  that  the  hearing  of  witness
    evidence during the appeal process was vital  to  the  success  of  the
    appellants on appeal.



Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Lindsley
13th December 2014

Annex A

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

     1. The appellants are citizens of Ukraine. The first appellant is born
        on 30th August 1969 and the second appellant  on  27th  June  1964.
        They are married. They say that they came to the  UK  in  1996  and
        have remained in the UK unlawful since that time. On 6th July  2012
        they applied for indefinite leave to remain on the basis  of  their
        long residence in accordance with paragraph 276B of the Immigration
        Rules in force at that time. These  applications  were  refused  on
        13th November 2013 and they appealed on 2nd  December  2013.  Their
        appeals against the  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State  were
        dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingam  in  a  determination
        promulgated on the  16th  July  2014.  She  found  that  the  first
        appellant had only been  in  the  UK  since  2012  and  the  second
        appellant since 2006.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       JM Holmes on 6th October 2014 on the basis it was arguable the First-
       tier Tribunal had erred in law as to the credibility of  the  second
       appellant's evidence as evidence regarding his cognitive and  memory
       problems was not considered relevant  to  this  issue.  Further  the
       approach to the different  spelling  of  the  appellants'  names  on
       documents and the appellants' attitude to documents with their names
       being spelt wrongly was also arguably legally flawed. Further  Judge
       Lingam did not make negative credibility findings in relation to the
       three witnesses who gave evidence on behalf of  the  appellants  but
       also did not attach any weight  to  their  evidence  without  giving
       reasons: this was also an arguably unlawful approach to evidence.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions

    4. Mr Seelhoof relied upon the grounds of appeal.

    5. These contended that it was an error of law for Judge Lingam not  to
       have made specific credibility  findings  about  the  three  British
       citizen witnesses who attended the Tribunal and  thereafter  not  to
       have given their evidence appropriate weight. Ms Scagnelli said  she
       had seen the appellants regularly since 1999; Ms Davies said she had
       met the first appellant in 1998 and given her money as a cleaner and
       child-carer. Ms Ellard said she had  employed  the  first  appellant
       since  2005.  Their  evidence  was  therefore  clearly   potentially
       material to the key issue before the Tribunal. The only challenge to
       Ms Davies' evidence was, that it was said her evidence  differed  as
       she said she did not "pay" the first appellant,  where  as  evidence
       from the second appellant was that she did pay the first  appellant.
       However Mrs Davies evidence was that she  put  money  in  the  first
       appellant's hand-bag (this was Mr Seelhoof's record of the evidence,
       and that of the Home Office Presenting Officer and  I  confirmed  it
       accorded with the Record of Proceedings at p.4). There was therefore
       no reason at all to find her  evidence  not  credible,  or  fail  to
       consider it in the determination of the appeal, as had been done  by
       Judge Lingam.  Ms Scagnelli's evidence had been given no  assessment
       or consideration simply on the basis that she had said she had  seen
       the first appellant once a month compared to the  first  appellant's
       assessment of two or three times a month on average. This was not  a
       lawful approach to evidence either.

    6. Mr Seelhoof  also  contends  that  Judge  Lingam  took  an  unlawful
       approach to assessing evidence of unlawful residence in  discounting
       it because names were not spelt  consistently;  addresses  were  not
       consistent; money was actually paid in cash rather than via  a  bank
       as stated on documents;  the  issue  of  keeping  family  away  from
       friends; and using a friend's name on a council tax bill. .  It  was
       also said that the first appellant  had  used  discrepant  names  at
       paragraph 52 when in fact the names listed were all  consistent  bar
       one which has a different middle initial which was irrational. These
       matters were consistent with the history of unlawful  residence  the
       appellants gave, not a reason to find it implausible. The  treatment
       of supporting documentary evidence was particularly  unlawful  given
       that there was no contention by the respondent  or  finding  by  the
       Tribunal that it was false.

    7. Mr Seelhoof also contends that Judge Lingam made a finding that  the
       appellants had been inconsistent about what had  happened  to  their
       previous passports. In fact the history  in  their  representative's
       letter and before the Tribunal was  the  same.  At  all  points  the
       appellants had said the original  passports  were  retained  by  the
       Ukrainian Embassy when they obtained their new passports.

    8. Mr Seelhoof also argues that Judge Lingam had unlawfully  discounted
       the  report  of  Mr  T   Francis,   educational   psychologist,   in
       consideration of the quality of the second appellant's  evidence  on
       the basis that  it  had  been  prepared  to  show  that  the  second
       appellant could not fulfil the English language  requirement  -  see
       paragraph 42 of the  determination.  However  the  report  contained
       material about the second appellant's serious memory problems  which
       were clearly relevant to the accuracy of the evidence he was able to
       give to the Tribunal.

    9. Mr Tufan relied upon the Rule 24 notice. He contended  that  it  was
       reasonable to discount the report of Mr  Francis,  as  was  done  at
       paragraph 42 of the determination, as it had been prepared simply in
       relation to the second appellant's language skills. The evidence  of
       the appellants was properly discounted on the basis of discrepancies
       between them at paragraph 43 of the  determination.  Inconsistencies
       were also identified with the evidence of  the  other  witnesses  at
       paragraphs 34, 35, 36, 44, 46 and 54. The  determination  was  sound
       and sustainable and decided that the appellants could not  make  out
       their case to the required level of proof.

   10. At the end of the hearing I informed the parties that I  found  that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law for  the  reasons  set  out
       below and that I was setting the determination of Judge Lingam aside
       with no findings preserved. It was agreed that the re-making hearing
       should be adjourned as there was  insufficient  Tribunal  time,  and
       because there was no Ukrainian interpreter available.

Conclusions

   11. I find that Judge Lingam had erred in law in the assessment  of  the
       credibility of the appellants.  I find that overall Judge Lingam has
       not taken a rational approach to the assessment  of  credibility  of
       the appellants, and has made factual errors  in  carrying  out  this
       assessment which have detrimentally impacted on the appellants.

   12. It was not rational to discount the expert evidence of Mr T  Francis
       as is done at paragraph 42 of the determination. This is a report by
       a qualified professional educational psychologist. Whilst the  focus
       of the report is on the second appellant's ability to learn  English
       his conclusion in summary is  that  he  was  someone  of  very  high
       intelligence who had a severe car accident whilst  still  living  in
       Ukraine and was  left  with  great  difficulties  in  acquiring  new
       skills, and within the analysis of why this is the case it  is  said
       that since the time of the accident the  second  appellant  has  had
       weak memory skills (he is said to have a working memory index on the
       9th centile in response to standardised  tests  administered  by  Mr
       Francis). This was clearly relevant to consideration of evidence  of
       inconsistencies in the second appellant's evidence but Judge  Lingam
       gave it no consideration in this way at all.

   13.  As  Mr  Seelhoof  has  submitted  there  was  no   discrepancy   or
       inconsistency in the evidence about the  appellants'  old  passports
       being taken when their  new  ones  were  issued.  What  is  said  at
       paragraph 44 of the determination indicating this  is  the  case  is
       therefore inaccurate and unfairly placed in  the  balance  by  Judge
       Lingam as evidence that the appellants are not credible witnesses.

   14. It was not rational for Judge Lingam to find  that  the  appellant's
       credibility was reduced by their having documents which spelt  their
       names in slightly different ways as is done at a  number  of  points
       within the determination. It is notable that the respondent  accepts
       that payslips and P60s with the surname "German" did in fact  relate
       to the second appellant - see paragraph 47 of  the  determination  -
       and thus seemed to have an appreciation that this was something that
       might well happen in the case of someone without lawful residence.

   15. It is unclear what meaningful explanation the appellants could  have
       given with respect to small variations in  the  spelling  of  Mariya
       (sometimes Maria) and Vasyl (sometimes Vasile, Vasil or Vasiliy)  in
       documents issued by others - but Judge Lingam holds their failure to
       do this against them at paragraph 28. It does not make sense to  say
       that the appellants were not credible because they were not  careful
       (and insisting on corrections) about the spellings of their names as
       is done at paragraph 51, particularly given the expert  evidence  of
       the second appellant's total lack of linguistic ability  in  English
       and both appellants lack of status  and  thus  standing  vis  a  vis
       authority in the UK. The irrationality of this approach is  all  the
       more stark at paragraphs 52 and 53 of  the  determination  where  an
       inconsistent middle initial in one document is found  to  contribute
       to making documents  relating  to  the  first  appellant  of  little
       weight.

   16. I also find that Judge Lingam has failed to make a  finding  on  the
       credibility of the evidence of the three British  citizen  witnesses
       who attended the Tribunal and gave evidence. This was  something  he
       was obliged to do so  as  to  weigh  all  the  evidence  before  him
       appropriately. Not only did he formally  fail  to  do  this  but  in
       relation to Mrs Davies there were absolutely no valid reasons  given
       to discount (as he then does) her evidence at all. It was said  that
       there was an inconsistency over whether she paid the first appellant
       for her child care/ cleaning assistance but ultimately this was  not
       the case. The evidence of both appellants and Mrs  Davies  was  that
       some money changed hands, even if the first appellant and Mrs Davies
       did not formally wish to see this as "pay".  Clearly  this  evidence
       was highly pertinent to the key issue of the appellants'  length  of
       residence, as Mrs Davies informed the Tribunal that  she  had  known
       the first appellant since 1998 and had seen her  regularly  for  the
       past 17 years.

   17. Credibility must be assessed in the round on consideration of all of
       the evidence before the Tribunal. I find this has not been done in a
       rational or factually accurate way on a number of counts as set  out
       above, and thus that the determination discloses an error of law.  I
       find this error to be material as if the evidence had been  properly
       considered a different conclusion and outcome  for  the  appeal  may
       have been reached.

Decision

   18. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law.

   19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

Directions

1. The appeal will be remade de novo  before  me  on  Friday  12th  December

days prior to the hearing.

4. A Ukrainian interpreter is required.
