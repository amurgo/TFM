Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr P Richardson, counsel (instructed by Morgan Mark
Solicitors)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as "the secretary of state" and to  the
      respondent as "the claimant."


   2. The claimant is a national of Pakistan, born on 15 October  1985.  His
      appeal against the decision of the secretary  of  state  refusing  his
      application dated 24  July  2014  to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier
      1(Entrepreneur) Migrant was allowed by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  D
      Ross in a decision promulgated on 14 August 2015.


   3. In particular,  the  Judge  stated  that  so  far  as  advertising  is
      concerned, the claimant has produced an I Yell advertisement for Essex
      [11].  He  noted  that  the  claimant's  partner's   application   had
      succeeded. He found that the appellant had proved that the company  is
      genuine and that he does intend to invest �50,000 in the company [12].




   4. On 16 December 2015 First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Frankish  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal. He noted that the application
      for permission asserted that the Judge had  allowed  the  claimant  to
      rely on a Yell advertisement which is inadmissible under s.85A of  the
      2002 Act. This arguably amounted to "admitting the inadmissible".


   5. Mr Bramble relied on the grounds of appeal. He referred to the reasons
      for refusal dated 6 January 2015. With  regard  to  "Advertising"  the
      secretary of state stated at page 4 that the appellant had provided  a
      copy of an advert for his company on  Gumtree.com  which  was  printed
      from the Internet on 22 July 2014. However, a search  on  Gumtree  for
      this advert undertaken on 21 October 2014 has shown no results for the
      company. This casts doubt on the credibility of the advertising.


   6. Mr Bramble submitted that the Yell advertisement for Essex referred to
      by the Judge at [11] had not been provided to the secretary  of  state
      with the claimant's application. None of the s.85A(4)(a-d)  exceptions
      apply. The Judge erred in relying on evidence he was not entitled  to.
      Accordingly, "the entire findings on the credibility of  the  business
      have been infected."


   7. He submitted that during the claimant's interview,  which  took  place
      prior to the date of decision, the appellant was  asked  where  he  is
      advertising his business. The answer recorded is "there is  3-4  Essex
      online marketing - Isex, Thomas Local, Gum Tree, Linked in.  There  is
      also Yellow Pages going to be printed in the next paper version,  it's
      on the website at the moment."


   8. Accordingly, the claimant indicated that it was not something that was
      produced together with the application. That was the  reason  for  the
      refusal and the appeal should  have  been  dismissed.  The  Judge  has
      relied solely on this advertisement.


   9. On behalf of the claimant, Mr Richardson submitted  that  "context  is
      all in this appeal". Permission has not been  granted  on  the  ground
      that the Judge failed to make a finding about a Gumtree  advert.  This
      was not a ground of appeal raised by the secretary of state. The  only
      ground raised was an objection pursuant to s.85(A) of the 2002 Act.


  10. The Judge had regard to advertising material not before the  secretary
      of state, namely the production of an I Yell advertisement for  Essex.
      Mr Richardson referred to page  19  of  the  claimant's  bundle.  This
      contained a small iEssex advertisement in relation  to  Blogsoft  Ltd,
      setting out the business information and products. He  set  out  other
      local companies.


  11. At page 21  of  the  claimant's  bundle,  there  is  the  Yell  advert
      containing online advertising. He accepted  that  this  had  not  been
      submitted together with the application. It was printed out on 22 July
      2015.


  12. He submitted that the reasons for refusal  did  not  suggest  that  no
      advertising material was submitted. All that the  secretary  of  state
      stated at page 4 of the refusal was that a search on Gumtree  for  the
      advert undertaken on  21  October  2014  showed  no  results  for  the
      claimant's company,  which  cast  doubt  on  the  credibility  of  his
      advertising.


  13. He contended that leaving aside that advertising cannot be "a question
      of credibility," how can an advert result or undermine the credibility
      of the application?


  14. He submitted that the point has no merit and that  any  error  is  not
      material. The claimant made the application on 21 July 2014;   he  was
      interviewed subsequently on 13 October 2014.


  15. He was asked a number of questions at the "credibility"  interview  as
      set out at F1 of  the  secretary  of  state's  bundle.  He  was  asked
      (question 19) where he was  advertising  his  business.  The  claimant
      answered "there is 3-4 Essex Online Marketing - i.sex  -Thomas  Local,
      Gumtree, Linked In. There is also Yellow Pages going to be printed  in
      the next paper version, it's on the website at the  moment."  He  then
      identified "his own website".


  16. He was not asked whether the Gumtree advert was still live. Nor was it
      contended that they doubted his credibility as a businessman.


  17. He accepted that the Judge may not have dealt "satisfactorily" at [11]
      regarding the issue raised in the  reasons  for  refusal  at  page  4.
      However, in the context of the overall findings as to the  genuineness
      of the claimant's business, he has given other reasons at [9-12].


  18. Only one of the reasons is picked up in the  grounds  for  permission.
      This constitutes a minor point and is in any  event  not  relevant  or
      material to the findings relating to genuineness. Accordingly from the
      answer given by the claimant at interview, there was already  evidence
      before the decision maker of a Yell.com advert  which  appears  to  be
      what the Judge was referring to at [11].


  19. There was a reference in the interview to the rest of the  methods  of
      advertising. This remained unchallenged. Nor is there any  issue  that
      the appellant was advertising on Yell.com or iEssex. The fact that the
      Judge considered a document that he should not have,  is  consequently
      not a material error in the circumstances.  The  fact  that  documents
      were produced regarding what was referred  to  in  the  interview  was
      accordingly not material.


  20. Mr Richardson also referred to the fact that the claimant's  partner's
      appeal had been allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lester.  He  now
      has permission to remain until 2018. That has not been  challenged  on
      appeal.


      Assessment


  21. Judge Ross has referred to the reasons for refusal in some  detail  at
      [3]. Those included assertions that the  claimant  did  not  genuinely
      intend to establish or take over a business within the next six months
      or that he intended to invest �50,000 in  the  business  or  that  the
      money was available to him. It was also contended  that  the  claimant
      had agreed a contract with another company  which  did  not  make  any
      sense. Further, the agreement did not detail the fee  which  would  be
      paid for the services. It was accordingly not considered that this was
      a genuine contract. It was  also  noticed  that  the  company  website
      contained an error on the careers page with an unfinished sentence.


  22.  The  Judge  then  referred  to  the  issue  raised  relating  to  the
      advertising, stating that a copy of an advert on Gumtree was  produced
      but that a search on the website  had  produced  no  results  for  the
      company.


  23. There were other matters raised concerning the relevant experience  of
      the claimant in this field of business, and that he had used his  post
      work visa to gain any relevant experience [3].


  24. The Judge had before him a bundle containing 74 pages. This included a
      statement from the claimant which is set out and summarised at [5].


  25. Moreover, the claimant gave evidence at the hearing, noting that Judge
      Lester had allowed his partner's appeal. The issue in  that  case  was
      whether the business was fully in place by 11  July  2014.  The  Judge
      found that it was. It was not the case that the Judge determined  that
      it was not a genuine business [6]. The Judge considered the  documents
      produced including a company newsletter.  There  were  also  Companies
      House documents and some advertising materials [9].


  26. The Judge dealt with the "criticisms" raised in the refusal which  are
      set out at [11].  With  regard  to  advertising,  he  noted  that  the
      claimant has produced an I Yell advertisement for Essex. He went on to
      find that it is clear that the claimant and his partner  are  a  team.
      The claimant provides the management expertise  and  his  partner  the
      technical [11].


  27. Although at [12] the Judge had concerns about the business,  he  found
      on balance, having regard to the fact that the  partner's  application
      has  already  succeeded  and  that  he  also  claimed  to  be  running
      Softblogs, that the claimant has proved the  company  is  genuine  and
      that he does intend to invest �50,000 in it.


  28. The single ground relied on by the secretary of  state  was  the  sole
      ground upon which permission to appeal was granted.


  29. There is no  ground  raised  against  the  propriety  of  the  Judge's
      findings regarding the reasons raised in the  refusal  letter  or  his
      conclusion that the claimant's application was genuine.


  30. The complaint is that the Judge had regard to a Yell advertisement for
      Essex which he was not permitted to refer to, having regard  to  s.85A
      of the 2002 Act. It is said that the advertisement was not before  the
      decision maker. It is contended that a reference to that advertisement
      affects the whole of the findings relating to the genuineness  of  the
      application.


  31. I have had regard to question 19 of the claimant's interview  and  his
      answer, which I have already set out. He stated with regard  to  where
      he is advertising his  business,  that  "there  is  3-4  Essex  Online
      Marketing - i.sex -Thomas Local, Gumtree, Linked  in.  There  is  also
      Yellow Pages going to be printed in the next paper  version,  it's  on
      the website at the moment."


  32. It appears from the documentation in the claimant's  bundle  that  the
      website for Yellow Pages is Yell.com. Accordingly, as submitted by  Mr
      Richardson, there was already evidence before the decision  was  taken
      of a Yell.com advert.


  33. It is contended that the  Judge's  regard  to  such  an  advertisement
      either did not offend s.85A at  all  or  offended  the  section  in  a
      "wholly immaterial manner."


  34. There was accordingly other advertising referred to at the  interview.
      This has never been disputed in any way by  the  secretary  of  state.
      Moreover, in the reasons for refusal, it was noted that  the  claimant
      did provide a copy of an advert for his company on  Gumtree.com  which
      was printed from the Internet on 22 July 2014.


  35. It is not disputed that that advert had appeared on Gumtree on 22 July
      2014. The claimant  had  confirmed  that  during  his  interview.  The
      secretary of state's contention that  a  search  on  Gumtree  for  the
      advert which was undertaken on 21 October 2014 showed no  results  for
      the company, casting doubt "on the credibility  of  your  advertising"
      ignores the fact that there was other advertising referred to  in  the
      interview. Moreover it has never been  disputed  that  a  copy  of  an
      advert for his company on Gumtree.com printed on 22 July 2014 had been
      supplied. There is no contention that the printed out advert produced,
      was in any way suspect or bogus. The fact that  a  search  some  three
      months later showed  no  results  for  his  company  did  not  in  the
      circumstances cast doubt on the credibility of his advertising.


  36. In the circumstances, any error relating to the reference by the Judge
      to the I yell  advertisement  could  not  have  infected  his  overall
      findings relating to genuineness.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  did  not  involve  the
      making of any material error on a point of law. It  shall  accordingly
      stand.


      No anonymity direction is made.
