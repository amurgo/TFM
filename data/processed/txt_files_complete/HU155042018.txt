                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Abebrese,  promulgated  on  17th  July  2019,  dismissing  the
    decision, dated 30th  May  2018,  to  refuse  entry  clearance  to  the
    appellant in respect of a human  rights  claim  made  by  her  on  27th
    February 2018.

Background

2.   The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 14th April  1941.   She
    was 78 years old at the date of the judge's decision.  She sought entry
    clearance to settle in the  UK  with  Ms  Onipede,  her  daughter  (the
    sponsor), who is present and settled in this country.

3.   In her settlement application the appellant claimed that she needed  to
    join the sponsor because she was unable to wash, dress or prepare  food
    without assistance.  She  suffered  from  cataracts  and  had  mobility
    problems stemming from arthritis and a problem with her  kneecaps.  The
    appellant received �70 a month from the sponsor and  a  further  �50  a
    month from her other four children, all of whom were  resident  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The appellant also received  a  state  and  retirement
    pension.

4.   The appellant was divorced from her husband. Although  she  had  a  67-
    year-old sister in Nigeria the sister lived in another  state  and  the
    appellant rarely saw her. The appellant relied on the goodwill  of  her
    neighbours for assistance, but this was  said  to  be  unreliable.  The
    sponsor indicated at the appeal hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal
    that the appellant previously employed a maid who took advantage of her
    financially.

5.   In refusing the entry clearance  application  the  respondent  was  not
    satisfied as to the relationship between the appellant and her sponsor.
    Nor was the Entry Clearance Officer satisfied that the requirement of E-
    ECDR.2.4. of Appendix FM  of  the  immigration  rules  were  met.  This
    requires the applicant to  need  long-term  personal  care  to  perform
    everyday tasks as a result of age, illness or disability. Nor  was  the
    respondent satisfied that the requirement of E-ECDR.2.5. were met. This
    requires that, even with the practical and  financial  support  of  the
    sponsor, the applicant is unable to obtain the required level  of  care
    in her own country, either because it is not available and there is  no
    person in the country who can reasonably provide it, or because  it  is
    not affordable.

6.   The application constituted a human rights claim within  the  terms  of
    s.113 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  (the  2002
    Act) and, as such, the refusal of the application gave the appellant  a
    right of appeal pursuant to  s.82  of  the  2002  Act.   The  appellant
    exercised her right of appeal.

The judge's decision

7.   At the appeal  hearing  the  appellant  was  not  legally  represented,
    although the sponsor appeared on her behalf.  In  the  section  of  his
    short decision entitled "Findings" the judge  found  that  the  sponsor
    gave  credible  evidence  in  respect  of  her  relationship  with  the
    appellant. Then, at paragraph 12 the judge stated:-

     "I also do not find the evidence of the appellant and sponsor  credible
         in relation to [sic]  physical  condition  of  the  appellant.  The
         respondent at the time of the decision found that the appellant had
         not provided any medical evidence. I was provided with  an  updated
         medical report at the hearing which I have attached  no  weight  to
         because it was not before the Entry Clearance Officer or the  Entry
         Clearance Manager. I was not provided with a plausible  reason  why
         this evidence could  not  have  been  provided  earlier."  [judge's
         emphasis]

8.   At paragraph 15 the judge  noted  that  other  some  medical  evidence,
    dating from July 2018, had earlier been provided, but  this  post-dated
    the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer.  The judge referred  to  a
    review by an Entry Clearance Manager, although I have seen no  evidence
    of such a review in the papers before me.  The  judge  noted  that  the
    Entry Clearance Manager's review was not provided to the sponsor.

9.   The judge briefly considered the  medical  evidence  dating  from  July
    2018. This indicated that the appellant had  a  cataract  operation  on
    11th July 2018, and reference was made to a knee operation.  The  judge
    stated, "The medical evidence does not make any reference to the extent
    of any care and assistance that may be required by the appellant".

10.  At paragraph 14 the judge noted that the appellant  failed  to  provide
    documentary evidence that the care she required was  not  available  in
    Nigeria. The judge considered the sponsor's evidence that the appellant
    previously employed a maid who was dismissed because  of  her  conduct.
    The maid had not been dismissed because she was unable to carry out the
    required duties and the judge concluded that it was possible to  obtain
    the assistance of another maid who would  not  take  advantage  of  the
    appellant. The sponsor's  evidence  suggested  to  the  judge  that  no
    further steps had been taken to employ another person.  The judge found
    that the required level of care would be available in Nigeria and  that
    the sponsor and the other siblings in  this  country  could  assist  by
    supplementing the cost of care. The judge concluded that the  appellant
    was unable to satisfy the requirements of  the  immigration  rules  and
    that the refusal was  proportionate  given  that  the  appellant  would
    continue to receive the required level of care in Nigeria.

The challenge to the judge's decision

11.  The grounds, settled by the sponsor herself, make  various  assertions.
    They  contend  that  there  was  procedural  irregularity  because  the
    respondent failed to comply with Rule  23  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014.  The
    grounds contend that the judge wrongly referred  to  a  decision  dated
    26th June 2018 when the decision under challenge  was  dated  30th  May
    2018.  They contend that the judge failed to  adequately  consider  the
    evidence relating to the appellant's former husband and her sister, and
    that the sponsor was cut off by the  judge  during  her  evidence  when
    describing the difficulties the appellant faced in Nigeria. The grounds
    further contend that  the  judge  failed  to  adequately  consider  the
    medical evidence dating from July 2018, including  a  report  from  the
    Faleti Medical  Centre  indicating  that  the  appellant  had  impaired
    mobility due to severe osteo-arthritic changes in her knee and cataract
    operations and confirming that the knee and eye conditions were a major
    cause of impairment to the  appellant's  mobility  and  self-care.  The
    grounds finally contend that the  judge  entirely  failed  to  consider
    further medical evidence dating from May 2019 and  improperly  drew  an
    adverse inference from the earlier omission of  this  evidence  on  the
    basis that no plausible explanation was provided in circumstances where
    the sponsor was not asked to give an explanation.

12.  In granting permission to the  Upper  Tribunal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Sheridan stated:-

         "At paragraph 12 the judge stated that no weight was being attached
         to an undated medical report because it was not  before  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer or Entry Clearance Manager. It is  arguable  that
         this  is  inconsistent  with  Section  85(4)  of  the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which provides that matters arising
         after the date of decision may be considered.  See HH  (conditional
         appeal decisions) Somalia [2017] UKUT 00490 (IAC)."

13.  The sponsor  focused  her  submissions  by  reference  to  the  judge's
    failure to consider the new medical evidence. By disregarding  the  new
    evidence the sponsor was denied the  opportunity  of  showing  how  the
    health of her mother had further declined, how the appellant  could  do
    even less than she could before, and  consequently  that  the  required
    level of care was now such that there was no-one who could  provide  it
    in Nigeria. The respondent did not oppose the  appellant's  application
    for permission to appeal and "invited the  Tribunal  to  determine  the
    appeal with a fresh oral (continuance) hearing to consider whether  the
    appellant's  updated  medical  evidence  would  have  made  a  material
    difference to the outcome." In her oral submissions Ms Jones  submitted
    that the further medical evidence, properly considered, could not  have
    materially altered the judge's conclusions because  it  still  did  not
    show the extent to which  the  appellant  required  care  in  order  to
    perform everyday tasks  and  there  was  still  no  evidence  that  the
    appropriate level of care was unavailable or was too expensive.

Discussion

14.  There is no merit in the grounds dependent on a breach of  Rule  23  of
    the 2014 Procedure Rules.  Although the respondent may have  failed  to
    provide a statement as to why he or she opposed the appeal, this  would
    necessarily have been apparent  from  the  arguments  advanced  by  the
    Presenting Officer at the First-tier Tribunal hearing. A  copy  of  the
    appellant's application form was provided to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    and there is nothing to indicate that the sponsor was  not  offered  an
    opportunity to consider the  application  form  or  the  evidence  that
    accompanied the application.  In any event, a failure to comply with  a
    direction of the Procedure Rules does not of  itself  render  void  the
    proceedings or any step taken in the proceedings (see  Rule  6  of  the
    2014 Procedure Rules).

15.  I acknowledge that the  judge  made  a  mistake  in  referring  to  the
    decision under challenge as being  made  on  26  June  2018,  but  this
    mistake is not material to  the  substance  of  the  judge's  decision.
    There is little merit in  the  contention  that  the  judge  failed  to
    adequately consider the appellant's relationship with her ex-husband as
    the judge did not rely on the ex-husband in his decision, and the judge
    was entitled to note that, although the sister lived in another  state,
    the appellant still had family in Nigeria. I do however find  that  the
    judge erred in law by failing  to  consider  the  most  recent  medical
    evidence.

16.  Headnote (2) of HH (Somalia) reads, "Even  in  entry  clearance  cases,
    Section 85(4) allows  post  decision  evidence  provided  it  does  not
    constitute a new matter".

17.  At paragraph 20 of HH the Upper Tribunal stated:-

         "It is no longer the case that the Tribunal, in deciding an  appeal
         of this kind, is confined to the evidential situation as it was  at
         the date of the refusal of entry clearance.  Section 85(4) provides
         that it is possible for the Tribunal to consider  evidence  arising
         at a later time, providing that it does not constitute a new matter
         as defined by Section 85(6)".


18.  There was  no  suggestion  in  the  present  appeal  that  the  further
    evidence constituted a new matter.  Although HH was not concerned  with
    Appendix FM the principles of equal applicability,  I  have  considered
    Appendix FM-SE, particularly paragraph 'D' of FM-SE and  paragraphs  33
    to 37. Paragraph 'D' indicates that,  in  deciding  an  application  in
    respect of which  specified  documents  must  be  provided,  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  or  Secretary  of  State  will  consider  documents
    provided with an application and will only consider documents  provided
    after the application if certain requirements are met,  none  of  which
    are relevant in this case.

19.  Paragraphs 33 to 37 of Appendix FM-SE describe the evidence  that  must
    be provided to prove a family relationship and that,  as  a  result  of
    age, illness or disability, the appellant requires  long-term  personal
    care. The paragraphs also set out  the  independent  evidence  that  is
    required to  demonstrate  that  the  required  level  of  care  is  not
    available even with the practical and financial support of the sponsor.



20.  For the purposes of determining whether the Immigration Rules  are  met
    the requirements in respect of documentation that could  be  considered
    by an ECO are time specific.  There is however no such time restriction
    for a judge  when  considering  the  human  rights  claim  outside  the
    Immigration Rules  (see  HH  and  Hesham  Ali  [2016]  UKSC  60).   The
    immigration rules relating to entry clearance  as  an  adult  dependent
    relative are not a complete code in respect of  Article  8  and  it  is
    always incumbent on a judge to consider a  human  rights  claim  having
    regard to all relevant evidence.

21.  The respondent takes the position that even if the judge erred  in  law
    by failing to consider the most recent medical evidence, this error was
    not material such that it requires the decision to be set aside.  There
    was no independent evidence before the judge that the required level of
    care for the appellant would not be available in Nigeria, and the judge
    was properly entitled to find that the financial misdeeds of  one  maid
    did not  mean  that  all  other  maids  would  take  advantage  of  the
    appellant.   Nor  was  there  particular  evidence  of  any  particular
    emotional needs or bonds sufficient to establish a relationship  beyond
    those normally found between elderly parents and their adult  children,
    although there did appear to have been material financial dependence.

22.  The unconsidered medical evidence itself consisted  of  a  letter  from
    the Medical Director of  the  Faleti  Medical  Centre  and  radiologist
    reports indicating that the appellant suffered from stage 2  congestive
    heart failure, cardiomegaly (which relates to an  abnormal  enlargement
    of  the  heart),  hepatic  congestion   with   bilateral   interstitial
    thickenings (which I understand is a condition  affecting  the  lungs),
    and bilateral pleural effusion and degenerative  spinal  changes.  This
    evidence did not expressly state that, as a result of  her  illness  or
    disability or age, the appellant required long-term  personal  care  to
    perform everyday tasks. But because the judge did not consider  any  of
    this evidence, he did not think to question the sponsor in  respect  of
    it. In circumstances where an appellant is not  legally  represented  a
    judge may need to take on a more  inquisitive  role  in  obtaining  and
    assessing relevant evidence. There is  no  indication  that  the  judge
    asked  the  sponsor  about  the  consequences  of  her  mother's  heart
    condition,  or  the  bilateral   interstitial   thickenings,   or   the
    degenerative spinal changes, either in respect of how it  affected  the
    appellant's ability to perform everyday tasks, or  in  respect  of  the
    level of care that she now required in light of  this  further  medical
    evidence (which suggested a further decline in her wellbeing). Had  the
    judge not mistakenly excluded this  evidence  from  his  consideration,
    then the sponsor  may  have  been  able  to  give  materially  relevant
    evidence. As the sponsor said in the error of law hearing,  by  failing
    to consider the new evidence the appellant was denied  the  opportunity
    to show how her health had since declined and that there was no-one who
    could provide the required level of care. Although the requirements  of
    the immigration rules in respect of the type and timing of evidence  in
    support of an application by an adult dependent family member  may  not
    have been met, it remained possible, had the judge lawfully  considered
    the new evidence and made appropriate enquiries from the sponsor as  to
    the consequence of the new evidence - both on the  appellant's  ability
    to carry out everyday tasks and the availability of the required  level
    of support, that a different conclusion may have been reached.

23.  I am consequently satisfied, albeit by a narrow margin, that the  error
    of law identified above is material and that the decision is unsafe and
    must be set aside.

24.  Given the need for further extensive factual findings  I  have  decided
    remit the matter for a de  novo  hearing  to  enable  any  further  new
    medical evidence and evidence of the availability  of  the  appropriate
    level of care to be provided.


Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision contains an error on a point of  law  and
is set aside.

The decision is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  determined
at a fresh hearing before  a  judge  other  than  Judge  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal Abebrese.
