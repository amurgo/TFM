For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Belgium born on 10 July 1990. He  appeals
    against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lucas dismissing  his
    appeal against the refusal to grant  him  admission  to  the  UK  under
    Regulation 11 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016.

2.   The Appellant did not  attend  the  hearing  as  he  has  been  refused
    admission. His representatives are in Belgium  and  have  made  written
    submissions on his behalf.

3.   Judge Lucas dismissed the Appellant's appeal on  the  grounds  that  no
    evidence had been submitted by the Appellant and there was  no  witness
    statement or other direct evidence to address the refusal decision made
    by the Respondent on 28 April 2018.  The judge found that the burden of
    proof was on the Appellant and he had failed to discharge that  burden.



4.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb  on  the
    grounds it was arguable that as the Respondent was alleging  dishonesty
    and/or fraudulent behaviour then the  burden  was  on  the  Respondent.
    However, the Respondent had not put in any evidence  to  establish  the
    claimed conduct by the Appellant and  therefore  it  was  arguable  the
    judge erred in law in dismissing the appeal.

5.   The Appellant was refused entry to the UK for the following reasons:-


         "On 28th April 2018 you attempted to facilitate the  illegal  entry
         to the UK of PU, a Rwandan national, on a Belgium identity card for
         which she was not the rightful holder".

6.   There was no evidence, other than the assertion  made  in  the  refusal
    letter, before the First-tier Tribunal and therefore the judge erred in
    law in requiring the Appellant to provide evidence when the  Respondent
    had  failed  to  make  out  their  case  of  dishonesty  or  fraudulent
    behaviour. I find that the judge has made an error of law  in  applying
    the incorrect burden of proof. Accordingly, I set  aside  the  decision
    dated 5 March 2019 and remake it.

7.   Mr Walker produced a printout from the database  dated  28  April  2018
    giving the Home Office reference COQ/5140722 and the Appellant's  name.
    It stated:-


         "Passenger attempted to facilitate the entry to the United  Kingdom
         of one RWA national on a BEL identity card.   They  were  party  of
         seven travelling to the United Kingdom to attend a wedding.  During
         interview the RWA national - COQ5140716 - stated that she  was  the
         girlfriend of one of the passengers in the  minibus  and  confirmed
         that everyone knew that she was  not  the  rightful  (sic)  of  the
         document she produced".

8.   Mr Walker also produced a Home Office minute sheet dated  11  May  2018
    which stated:-

     "The passenger arrived at the UKCZ Coquelles and  presented  a  Belgium
         identity card. He was travelling to the  United  Kingdom  with  six
         other Belgium nationals and they were going to  attend  a  friend's
         wedding. On initial interview at the desk the whole group confirmed
         that  they  were  all  travelling  together.  One  of  the  Belgium
         nationals  was  not  the  rightful  holder  of  the  document   she
         presented. Mr HH  COQ/5140714  -  one  of  the  passengers  in  the
         vehicle,  confirmed  he  was  boyfriend  of  the  look  alike,  and
         confirmed her name as on the Belgium identity card she presented  -
         CM (COQ5140716).

         In summary, CM confirmed her true identity as PU and gave her  date
         of birth as [1984], a RWA national. She confirmed she was attending
         a mutual  friend's  wedding  with  her  friends  and  boyfriend  in
         Leicester.  She confirmed that the card belonged  to  a  friend  of
         hers who let her borrow it as she did not have a visa for  the  UK.
         She had a residence card for Belgium  but  no  visa  to  enter  the
         United Kingdom. This is why she  was  using  the  Belgian  identity
         card.  She also went on to say that it was not  the  fault  of  the
         other occupants as they did not know she was using a fake  card  to
         travel today until they all got in the van."

9.   I find that this evidence is insufficient to show  that  the  Appellant
    was aware that one of the passengers was using a  false  identity  card
    and therefore that he had in  some  way  attempted  to  facilitate  her
    entry. It is clear from the Home Office minute sheet that her boyfriend
    took responsibility and confirmed her identity card.  It could  not  be
    said that the other passengers were complicit on  the  evidence  before
    me. PU's statement that the other occupants in the  van  did  not  know
    that she was using a fake card until  they  got  in  the  van  was  not
    sufficient to show that the Appellant had attempted to  facilitate  her
    illegal entry.

10.  The Appellant denies knowledge of the use of a false identity  card  by
    PU. He did not know PU before she was introduced to him and  the  other
    passengers in the van by her boyfriend HH. Although I am not  bound  by
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cruthers  dated  30  January
    2019, allowing the appeal of three other passengers in the van, I  take
    judicial notice of his findings.

11.  On the facts the Respondent had  failed  to  show  that  the  Appellant
    would pose a threat to the requirements of  public  policy  if  he  was
    allowed admission to the UK. The Respondent has failed to discharge the
    burden of proof and I allow the Appellant's appeal.
