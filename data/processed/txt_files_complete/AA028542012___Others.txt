                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

   Pursuant to the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, rule 17

 1. The  Secretary  of  State  appealed  against  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    determination allowing these appellants' appeals. Permission to  appeal
    was granted to her by Designated Judge Peart because he considered  the
    First-tier Tribunal's findings to be arguably perverse in  relation  to
    the available medical treatment in South Korea.

 2. The claimants did not appear at the hearing or arrange  representation.
    At the hearing, Mr Norton who  appeared  for  the  Secretary  of  State
    explained that asylum had been granted to  all  of  the  claimants  and
    their appeals were therefore abandoned by operation of law, pursuant to
    section 104(4A) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as
    amended) and paragraph 16 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (as amended).

 3. The Secretary of State therefore sought to withdraw her case before the
    Upper Tribunal, under rule 17 of the Procedure Rules.

 4. On behalf of the Upper Tribunal, and in my capacity as a judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, I consent to that withdrawal.

 5. There is therefore no longer an outstanding appeal  before  either  the
    First-tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal.
