                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Ms  SI  Bayne),
   sitting at Hatton Cross on 13 May 2003, dismissing an asylum  and  human
   rights appeal by a Kurdish citizen of Turkey. Permission  was  given  on
   the basis of the adjudicator's  credibility  findings  on  some  of  the
   claimant's history.

2. The hearing on 6 February 2004 was adjourned for reasons which need  not
   now concern us: quite fortuitously in the interval  there  appeared  the
   decision in [2004] UKIAT 00038 O (Turkey), which cast a  very  different
   light on the position at the point of return, in  cases  such  as  this,
   from that apparently shed in [2003] UKIAT 00034 ACDOG (Turkey). 38 O was
   a decision of Lane VP and a lay member, followed in [2004] UKIAT 00050 A
   (Turkey) by Judge Ainley VP in a similar panel. Mr Siddle,  for  reasons
   which will become clear, asked us to disregard both 38 O  and 50  A   in
   favour of ACDOG, on the basis that that had been  a  decision  of  three
   vice-presidents, intended to be comprehensive.

3. Even if ACDOG had been decided under  the  present  system  of  'country
   guidance' cases, which it was  not,  it  could  not  have  been  applied
   without regard to further important factual information,  such  as  that
   which had appeared in 38  O  No  judicial  decision  has  the  power  of
   crystallizing the facts of  the  real  world  to  an  extent  where  not
   reality, but what has been said about it is  the  guide.  What  'country
   guidance' cases are intended to do is to  lay  down  an  approach  to  a
   settled factual situation, not to decree that that situation  is  to  be
   treated as if it were the same for ever. For these reasons, we  declined
   to regard ourselves as bound by the view of the facts set out in ACDOG -
   we are not of course bound by the view taken in 38 O or 50  A  either  -
   and we made it clear to Mr Siddle  that  we  should  consider  the  real
   situation at the point of return to Turkey  on  the  basis  of  all  the
   relevant decisions and other material put before us.

4. What had come to notice  for  the  first  time  in  38  O  was  detailed
   information about  the  contents  of  the  Turkish  central  information
   system, which appeared in the CIPU report of October 2003 at � 5.37:

   It is important to realise that there is a distinction in Turkey between
   "detain" (gozalt?n? almak) and "arrest" (tutuklamak). There is a similar
   distinction  in  jurisdictions  in  other  countries.  In  Turkey,   law
   enforcement agents can detain, but a Court decision is needed to  arrest
   somebody. In some cases law enforcement agencies  can  ex  officio  take
   somebody into custody but in these cases they are under an obligation to
   inform the Prosecutor within 24 hours.

   The further point noted in 38 O was that the GBTS system, the  only  one
   known to be  available  to  the  authorities  at  the  point  of  return
   (typically  Istanbul  airport)  contains  information  on  arrests,   so
   defined; but not on mere detentions.

5. Mr Siddle asked us not to pay any attention to this information, on  the
   basis that it had come from the Turkish authorities themselves, so  must
   automatically be suspect. We  disagree.  While  we  should  treat  value
   judgements by the authorities  of  Turkey,  or  any  other  state  whose
   methods come under criticism from time  to  time,  with  a  considerable
   degree of healthy scepticism,  the  reliability  of  relatively  neutral
   details of factual arrangements should in our view be  treated  in  much
   the same way as  any  other  factual  information.  In  this  case,  the
   detailed references to Turkish  legal  terms,  and  (in  38  O)  to  the
   contents of the GBTS, in our view  would  justify  us,  as  it  did  the
   Tribunals in both 38 O and 50 A, in accepting what is said  about  them,
   subject to any  challenges  Mr  Siddle  may  be  able  to  make  to  the
   information itself.

6. Mr Siddle's main such challenge was on the basis  that  the  Netherlands
   Government report which formed the basis for the view taken in ACDOG was
   still among the sources listed for the  present  CIPU  report  (and  its
   October 2003 predecessor where some of the information  in  38  O  first
   appeared). So, he said, it was illogical for the Home Office to pick and
   choose between different parts of it. How it can be said that anyone who
   regards part of a report as  accurate  and  informative  is  necessarily
   bound to prefer other parts of it to  information  from  another  source
   which may shed a different light on those parts, is  more  than  we  can
   understand.

7. Mr Davidson however did take us to the  origins  of  the  view  now  put
   forward by the Home Office. The October CIPU report (� 5.39)  refers  to
   arrests  being  on  the  GBTS:  though  it  seems  no-one  realized  the
   importance of this till 38 O, it is confirmed by the details quoted from
   the June 2003 report of the Swiss Refugee Organization shown at  �  5.48
   of the April 2004 CIPU report. Not only that, but a little earlier at  �
   5.42 it appears the well-known Mr David McDowell was saying that "...  a
   large  proportion  of  detentions  at  police  stations  appear  to   go
   unrecorded in a formal sense ...". In our view the Tribunals in 38 O and
   50 A were entirely justified in finding that only arrests, and not  mere
   detentions would be recorded on the GBTS.

8. That is however not the end of the question of what information would be
   available on this or any other claimant to the  Turkish  authorities  at
   the point of return, because the Swiss report already referred  to  goes
   on (see quotations at CIPU �� 5.55-57) to say that there is evidence  of
   individuals being denounced to the police as PKK sympathizers,  but  not
   appearing on the GBTS system; the various security forces each had their
   own information systems, as a result of which someone not on GBTS  might
   be sought by the "anti-terrorist unit"; the absence of  an  entry  about
   someone on GBTS should not be taken as evidence he was not at  risk,  as
   it must be assumed that someone taken into custody in the past might  be
   listed on one of the other information systems.

9. Mr Davidson's answer to that is to be found in 38 O at � 57 (and 50 A at
   � 21): there is no reason for the authorities  at  Istanbul  airport  to
   assume that a returning failed asylum-seeker is of any adverse  interest
   to the Turkish authorities; so no reason to look outside GBTS if nothing
   appeared on him there. On that, Mr Siddle referred us to � 6.104 of  the
   October CIPU report, about "in-depth  questioning"  of  those  returning
   without valid Turkish travel documents; but this was dealt with in 38  O
   at � 56: no Turkish citizen is now sent back to Turkey from this country
   without Turkish travel documents.

10. We  now  turn  to  the  history  given  by  this  claimant:  five  short
   detentions between 1996 and 2000, all in his own part  of  south-eastern
   Turkey, and none involving a court order or followed  by  a  charge;  in
   other words, detentions and not arrests, within the Turkish meaning seen
   above. On the view we have taken of the general situation at  the  point
   of return, there would be no record about him on the GBTS, and no reason
   for the authorities there to look elsewhere; so there would be  no  real
   risk at that point.

11. Assuming (for present purposes only,  and  without  deciding)  that  the
   adjudicator might have been wrong in taking the view that  that  history
   (which she accepted, apart from the last incident  in  2000)  would  not
   expose the claimant to any risk, even from the local authorities in  his
   own area, the question then arises as to whether he would be able to  go
   on from the airport to some other part of Turkey, without either  facing
   real risk there, or its being 'unduly harsh' to expect him to do so.

12. Mr Siddle did cite two decisions (without being able to produce  copies:
   they are referred to in Macdonald) to the effect that, where there is  a
   real risk of  persecution  by  State  authorities,  no  internal  flight
   alternative  is  available.  They  are  Orechkov  (18330)  and   Kumaran
   [00/TH/01459]. So far as these decisions may suggest that this is a rule
   of law, or even a general presumption of fact, we have not the slightest
   hesitation in taking the view  that  they  ought  not  to  be  followed.
   Whether an internal flight alternative is available must be  a  question
   of fact, to be decided on the facts of any  individual  case.  Sometimes
   persecution by State  authorities  may  indicate  serious  interest  and
   alertness by their agents in all parts of  the  state  in  question;  at
   other times not. In this case there is nothing to show that the claimant
   had ever been an object of  adverse  interest,  and  that  of  a  fairly
   passing kind, to anyone outside the police in his own area.

13. Mr Siddle's case on the facts relating to internal flight in  this  case
   is that the claimant could not lead any sort of  normal  life  elsewhere
   without registering with  the  local  muhtar  (administrative  headman),
   which would once again expose him to whatever records might exist  being
   taken up. Mr Siddle did not refer us to any evidence on the registration
   system; but it is fairly well-known: equally  well-known  are  the  many
   thousands of people living outside that system in the vast  shanty-towns
   (gecekondu) around Istanbul and other large cities. Mr Siddle  suggested
   that returning someone to that sort  of  existence  would  not  only  be
   'unduly harsh', but "inhuman or degrading treatment" contrary to article
   3 of the Human Rights Convention.

14. On this point, Mr Davidson referred us, first to  �  5.23  of  the  CIPU
   report:

   In theory, anyone  taking  up  residence  in  or  leaving  a  particular
   neighbourhood or village is supposed to report this to the local muhtar.
   In practice,  that  is  often  not  done,  with  the  muhtar  not  being
   approached until a need arises for a certificate of residence somewhere.

   As to when such a need might arise, he went on to � 6.205,  which  deals
   with employment,  without  any  mention  of  such  a  certificate  being
   required to get it.

15. While that last point is  certainly  not  conclusive  as  to  the  legal
   position in Turkey, the passage cited from � 5.23 suggests  to  us  that
   the day-to-day life of the mass of the population can perfectly well  be
   carried on without such a certificate. It follows in our  view  that  it
   would be neither 'unduly harsh' nor "inhuman or degrading treatment"  to
   expect a returned asylum-seeker to seek refuge in  some  other  part  of
   Turkey than his own, without  necessarily  registering  with  the  local
   muhtar. The result is that, even if (which as already made clear we  are
   not deciding) the adjudicator were wrong about the adverse interest  now
   likely to be taken in this claimant in his home area, she was  right  in
   the result she reached.
