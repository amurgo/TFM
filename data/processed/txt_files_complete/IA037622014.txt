                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr S Vokes, instructed by Ian Henery Solicitors Ltd
For the respondent:    Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Honggunang Li, date of birth 10.4.70, is  a  citizen  of
    China.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Devlin promulgated 21.5.14, dismissing  his  appeal  against  the
    decision of the respondent, dated 31.5.14, to  refuse  his  application
    for indefinite leave to remain in the  UK  as  a  work  permit  holder,
    pursuant to paragraph 134 of the Immigration Rules. The Judge heard the
    appeal on 6.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Simpson  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Devlin should be set aside.

 6. In essence, the grounds of application for permission to appeal  assert
    that  the  judge  made  adverse  findings  concerning  the  appellant's
    evidence  with  reference  to   spelling   mistakes,   including   more
    particularly with reference to claimed places of  work  and  residence.
    However, the decision itself contained similar errors of  spelling  and
    had missing and incomplete sentences and other mistakes. Even the  work
    permit evidence contained spelling errors, as did  the  HMRC  and  Home
    Office documents.

 7.  It  is  also  submitted  that  the  judge's  findings  concerning  the
    appellant's working were contradictory  by  finding  that  evidence  of
    employment had not been made out whilst finding that the  Secretary  of
    State's reliance on a HMRC research response could not be  relied  upon
    because it was not shown to have  been  made  against  the  appellant's
    claimed employer.

 8. Further, the judge unfairly  relied  on  a  new  issue  not  previously
    raised, the Life in the UK test certificate.

 9. Finally, it is submitted that as the article 8 findings were  based  on
    findings which had been made in error they could not stand.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Simpson found that  though  the
    decision is reasoned at some length," the judge's analysis of the facts
    arguably amounted to an error or errors of law inter alia unsustainable
    adverse findings concerning  errors  &  omissions  in  the  appellant's
    evidence and the raising of a matter  not  before  in  issue.  Arguable
    error(s) of law disclosed in the grounds."

11. The Rule 24 response, dated 7.8.14, submits that grammatical errors and
    factual errors in the decision, particularly those at �19 and �21,  are
    not material to the outcome of the appeal. Ultimately the judge was not
    satisfied with the  explanation  for  the  discrepancies  and  was  not
    satisfied that the appellant ever worked for the New World  Restaurant,
    let alone for a continuous period of 5 years.

12. For the reasons set out herein, I agree with  the  submissions  of  the
    appellant and find that there were such errors of fact in the  decision
    of the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the  conclusions  reached  are  not
    sustainable and that the article 8 assessment in reliance on  a  flawed
    factual basis cannot stand. Mr Smart accepted in his  submissions  that
    the there are significant difficulties with the determination  and  did
    not resist Mr Vokes contention that it contained such  material  errors
    of law that it should be set aside and remade.

13. The judge raised serious concerns with  the  appellant's  evidence  and
    explanations for discrepancies which were not satisfactorily explained.
    However, the extent of the factual errors by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge is such that it is impossible to regard the decision  as  a  fair
    assessment of the appellant's case. The outcome of the appeal  may  not
    prove to be any different, but in the  light  of  the  errors  fairness
    demands that the appeal be heard afresh with no findings preserved.

14. Although very lengthy the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is poorly
    drafted and contains numerous errors of grammar, spelling and  mistakes
    of fact that render it very difficult to understand. For  example,  the
    sentences at �19 and �21 are incomplete.  It  appears  that  the  judge
    intended to refer to case law, but  omitted  to  include  the  name  or
    citation.

15. However, it is not just a problem of comprehension, the judge relies on
    some  of  these  same  issues  as  undermining   of   the   appellant's
    credibility, describing them at various points as  "truly  discrepant,"
    and  dismissing  the  appellant's  explanation  for  discrepancies   in
    spelling.

16. For example at �33 there is reference to a letter from Mr Gheng,  dated
    8.7.10. At �41 this person is named as Mr Chang and his letter  is  now
    dated 9.7.10. At �59 the date of  the  same  letter  is  now  given  as
    8.7.13. At �60 the author is now referred to as Mr Cheng. The  decision
    also  contains  several  different  spellings  of   Chislehurst   Road,
    Broadacre Close, and the town of Bagillt, Clywd. The  judge  repeatedly
    misspelt the town name as Balgitt and yet the judge  did  not  find  it
    credible that Mr Chang/Gheng/Cheng would have mistyped the  address  of
    his restaurant on Chislehurst  Road,  Orpington,  Kent,  or  failed  to
    notice that it  had  been  misspelt.  The  judge  made  similar  errors
    throughout the determination. At �17(iii)  it  appears  that  the  same
    misspelling of Chislehurst Road as Christlehurst Road  appears  in  the
    appellant's work permit. From �97 it appears that it was spelt the same
    way in the HMRC database. It is difficult to  sustain  a  determination
    criticising, inter alia, the fact that a  witness  of  Chinese  made  a
    mistake in the correct spelling of a street name, when the  judge  also
    misspells place and street names, and the incorrect spelling is used on
    a work permit and HMRC documentation. Neither is it clear from �42 what
    the judge means by "truly discrepant;" it  may  be  as  little  as  the
    slight difference between Chiselhurst and Chislehurst.

17. I accept Mr Vokes' submission that these errors necessarily infect  the
    article 8 assessment. At �65(i)  the  judge  specifically  stated  that
    reason had been found to doubt the reliability of the letters  from  Mr
    "Chang" and Mr Lee.

18. In the circumstances, the decision is unsustainable  and  must  be  set
    aside and remade.

19. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

20. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

21. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the decision to be remade afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

22. The appeal is remitted to  be  relisted  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Birmingham, at the earliest convenient date;

23. The appeal is to be hear afresh, with no preserved findings of fact;

24. The time estimate is 1.5 hours;

25. If an interpreter was required at the First-tier Tribunal  hearing,  an
    interpreter in the same language should  be  booked  for  the  de  novo
    hearing.



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
