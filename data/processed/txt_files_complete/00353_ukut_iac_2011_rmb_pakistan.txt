Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Malik, Counsel instructed by Malik Law Chambers
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer

Paragraph  245AA(b)  of  HC  395  does  not  require  an   adjournment   for
verification checks by the Secretary of State where  what  are  said  to  be
"specified documents", called into question, are produced at the hearing  or
served so soon before the hearing as  to  provide  no  opportunity  for  the
Secretary of State to take the reasonable steps to  verify  those  documents
contemplated by that paragraph.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The issue in this appeal is a narrow one: where the Secretary of State
      calls into question the genuineness  of  documents  produced  for  the
      first  time  at  the  hearing  by  an  appellant  in  support  of  his
      application for leave to remain  in  a  category  falling  within  the
      points based system, or so soon before the hearing that there has been
      no opportunity for the respondent to  take  the  reasonable  steps  to
      verify those documents required by paragraph 245AA(b) of HC 395, is it
      open to the immigration judge to do otherwise  than  to  accept  those
      documents at face value, if  they  appear  to  qualify  as  "specified
      documents" or to grant an adjournment so that the respondent can carry
      out a review of those documents as contemplated by paragraph 245AA?


   2. As will be seen from  what  follows,  the  answer  to  that  question,
      despite the vigour with which counsel for the appellant  asserted  the
      contrary, is that the immigration judge is  indeed  entitled,  perhaps
      required, to carry out an assessment of such evidence as part  of  the
      ordinary judicial process by which evidence that the parties choose to
      put before the Tribunal is to be weighed.

   3. The appellant, who was born on 1 February 1980 and so is now 30  years
      old, is a citizen of Pakistan. He arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  in
      December 2003 with entry  clearance  as  a  student.  That  leave  was
      progressively extended until 2008 when he was granted further leave to
      remain, first under the International Graduates Scheme and then  as  a
      Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant until 24 July 2010. A few days before
      that leave expired he submitted an application for  further  leave  to
      remain as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant.  It  will  be  seen  from  this
      summary of his immigration history that he has substantial  experience
      of the process of making such applications.

   4. The application was refused by the respondent  on  3  September  2010.
      That was because in order to qualify for leave in  this  capacity  the
      appellant  needed  to  secure  75  points  under  Appendix  A  of  the
      Immigration Rules ("Attributes") but, because the evidence he  offered
      in support was not accepted as sufficient, he was awarded no points at
      all for previous earnings and, as a consequence, no points either  for
      "UK experience". This meant that  he  failed  to  score  the  required
      points and so failed to qualify for the grant of leave.

   5. In the refusal letter, the following explanation was  given  for  that
      outcome:

           "You have claimed 30 points for earnings of �51,217.


           As evidence of  your  earnings  you  have  provided  two  Public
           Carriage Licences, 1 letter from ASM Business Services, 1 set of
           accounts, 1 letter from One 2 One Cars, bank statements from two
           different  Halifax  bank  accounts  and  bank  statements   from
           Barclays.


           Paragraph 142 of the Tier 1 (General) guidance  states  that  in
           addition  to   demonstrating   their   earnings,   self-employed
           applicants must also provide two  different  forms  of  evidence
           listed under this paragraph in order to demonstrate their  self-
           employment. Two forms of additional evidence stated in paragraph
           142  for  self-employment  have  not  been   included   in   the
           application.


           The Tier 1 guidance states self-employed applicants must provide
           contact details of all their clients. No details of clients have
           been included in the application.


           Evidence  corroborating  individual  payments   has   not   been
           provided. Although bank statements have been provided, a  second
           form of evidence has not been included  in  the  application  to
           corroborate them.


           We have therefore been unable to  award  points,  in  line  with
           published guidance."

   6. Before examining the  reasons  given  by  the  immigration  judge  for
      dismissing the appeal, and the grounds for challenging that  decision,
      it is helpful to set out the relevant legal framework.


   7. Paragraph 245C provides that to  qualify  for  leave  to  remain,  the
      applicant must meet the requirements that are then  set  out.  If  the
      applicant does so, then leave to remain will be granted.  If  he  does
      not then his application will be refused. The requirement  with  which
      we are concerned is that the appellant secure 75 points under Appendix
      A. To do this he needed 30 points  in  respect  of  previous  earnings
      which he would have achieved  had  his  claimed  earnings  of  �51,217
      during the relevant period had been accepted.

   8. Paragraph 4 of Appendix A to HC 395 requires that "Specified documents
      must be provided as evidence of previous earnings".

   9. Paragraph 245AA(a) of  HC  395  provides  that  "specified  documents"
      means:

           "... documents specified by the Secretary of State in the Points
           Based System Policy Guidance as being  specified  documents  for
           the  route  under  which  the  applicant  is  applying.  If  the
           specified documents are not provided,  the  applicant  will  not
           meet the requirements for  which  the  specified  documents  are
           required as evidence."

  10. Paragraph 245AA(b),  which  is  of  particular  significance  in  this
      appeal, provides as follows:


           "If the Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  Secretary  of  State  has
           reasonable cause  to  doubt  the  genuineness  of  any  document
           submitted by an applicant which is, or which purports to  be,  a
           specified document under part 6A or Appendices A to C, or  E  of
           these Rules and, having taken reasonable  steps  to  verify  the
           document, is unable to verify that it is genuine,  the  document
           will be discounted for the purposes of this application."

  11. It was plain that  the  appellant's  claimed  earnings  had  not  been
      established by the documentary material submitted with the application
      and considered at the point of refusal of  it.  At  the  hearing,  the
      appellant's representative produced a bundle of documents  upon  which
      it was  sought  to  rely.  The  immigration  judge  noted  that  these
      documents had not been served upon the respondent although  there  was
      no objection from the respondent's representatives to those  documents
      being admitted in evidence.

  12. At paragraph 10 of his determination the immigration judge  summarised
      the content of that new bundle of documentary material:

           "This bundle of  documents  contained  the  Appellant's  witness
           statement  dated  2  December  2010,  correspondence  from  HMRC
           confirming registration for  tax  purposes  and  a  receipt  for
           National Insurance contributions for the period July to  October
           2010. There was also a Policy of Insurance for a small  business
           operating out of the appellant's  home  address  effective  from
           29th of November 2010. A letter from the Appellant's accountants
           and tax advisers ASM business Services dated 30th November  2010
           confirms that he was a client of theirs and  that  his  business
           activities included minicab driving  and  business  consultancy.
           The combined revenue from the two activities totalled �64,980.96
           with a net profit  before  tax  of  �51,217.  Accompanying  this
           bundle  were  several  documents  supporting   the   appellant's
           contentions that he was earning the said  income.  A  series  of
           monthly work reports from One-to-One  Cars  purportedly  setting
           out in sequence the fares which the appellant had been allocated
           as a private hire driver in any one month. The earliest of these
           reports was in April 2010.  There  was  also  a  summary  or  an
           analysis of cash deposits into the appellant's bank accounts.  A
           summary of income  from  the  appellant's  consultancy  services
           contain several  invoices  from  May  through  to  July  showing
           consultancy work undertaken for various named individuals."

  13. The oral evidence given by the appellant before the immigration  judge
      did not add to the cogency of that  documentary  evidence  but  rather
      served to undermine it. The appellant was asked about the evidence  of
      the fares allocated to him as a mini cab driver. The immigration judge
      said:


           "When it was pointed out to him that the sequence number running
           from 1 to 11 for the monthly work reports of June 2010  appeared
           to repeat itself in exactly  the  same  sequence  several  times
           throughout that month the appellant was  unable  to  provide  an
           explanation. .... [the appellant] denied that this was a  report
           which had been manufactured in order to bolster his application.
           He believed that it was  no  more  than  a  coincidence  in  the
           sequencing rather than anything else."

      The  immigration  judge  noted  a  similar  pattern  emerged  from  an
      examination of the documents relating to April 2010.


  14. The oral evidence of the appellant  concerning  his  consultancy  work
      also raised more questions than it  answered.  The  Immigration  Judge
      noted the position adopted by the respondent's representative  in  his
      submissions:


           "When turning  to  consider  the  consultancy  work  purportedly
           undertaken and producing an income  of  �29,000  many  questions
           were raised and not answered. There was no  supporting  evidence
           of what services were being provided by  the  Appellant  or  any
           indication on the face of the documents (who) the  clients  were
           and what the nature of their business was. In the circumstances,
           these invoices too raised  issues  of  credibility  and  in  the
           absence of supporting evidence they  should  not  be  considered
           genuine. The decision not to award points under  this  attribute
           for previous earnings should stand."


  15. The immigration judge set out his findings in  some  detail.  He  said
      that he found it "surprising" that the documents now relied upon  were
      produced only at the hearing, which meant that the respondent  had  no
      opportunity "to carry out  the  necessary  assessment  and  checks  to
      ensure that they were genuine". The immigration judge reminded himself
      that:


           "As Paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules makes plain, points
           can  only  be  awarded  when  an  applicant  provides  specified
           evidence that he meets the requirements for this category."


  16. The Immigration judge then set out the approach he proposed to take to
      the documentary evidence submitted at  the  hearing  and  it  is  this
      approach with which Mr Malik, counsel for the appellant, takes  issue.
      The immigration judge said this:


           "By necessity  I  have  to  undertake  an  assessment  of  their
           genuineness and,  in  effect,  conduct  the  same  exercise  the
           Respondent would have undertaken if the documents had been  made
           available at the date of the application."


  17. As Mr Malik did not suggest that the assessment was itself flawed, his
      complaint being that it was carried out by the judge at  all,  we  can
      set out shortly what the judge made  of  this  evidence.  As  for  the
      appellant's claimed earnings from mini cab driving the judge said:


           "As regards the documents  purportedly  evidencing  income  from
           private hire I do not find them genuine. I find the Appellant is
           not a credible witness because his explanation  for  the  repeat
           fares on the One-to-One Cars monthly work reports as being  mere
           coincidence or repeat clients was disingenuous to say the  least
           and certainly not credible in my judgement".


  18. The immigration judge was equally  unimpressed  with  the  appellant's
      evidence relating to the claimed consultancy work:


           ".... I find that the Appellant has not provided  a  cogent  and
           consistent explanation of the nature of those consultancies. The
           Appellant could not explain  what  the  precise  nature  of  the
           consultancy was. I found his account of  the  work  he  did  for
           clients was vague and uncertain. He did not fully  explain  what
           the precise nature of the consultancy was. I found  his  account
           of the work he did for clients was vague and uncertain.  He  did
           not explain who these individual clients were and why they  were
           being  invoiced  in  their  own  names   rather   than   (their)
           businesses. ........  In  the  circumstances  I  find  that  the
           documents submitted by the Appellant at the hearing give rise to
           a doubt that they are genuine such as to discount them  for  the
           purposes of the application.


           I discount the documents submitted before me and on  that  basis
           the Applicant has not (been) able to demonstrate that  he  meets
           the criteria for the award of points  as  claimed  for  previous
           earnings."


  19. Finally, to make clear unambiguously that he had in mind  the  process
      that would have been applied by the respondent had the documents  been
      submitted earlier, the immigration judge said this:


           "I have no doubt that if these documents had been  submitted  in
           accordance with the Respondent's Policy Guidance as required  by
           Paragraph 245AA  of  the  Rules  and  the  Respondent  had  been
           provided with an opportunity to check or  verify  these  records
           there would have been reasonable cause to doubt the  genuineness
           of the documents submitted."


  20. Mr Malik's submissions may be summarised as follows:


        a. The points based system is, and is intended to be, a  "tick  box
           system". If you tick the box then you succeed.
        b. Documents that, on their face, qualify  as  specified  documents
           should be accepted as such by the immigration  judge.  Paragraph
           245AA is there to deal with documents that are not genuine.
        c. The  immigration  judge  has  neither  the  experience  nor  the
           resources to carry out  the  assessment  required  by  Paragraph
           245AA. Therefore, where documents are produced  at  the  hearing
           that appear to be specified documents then, unless  he  excludes
           those documents under rule 51(7) of the Asylum  and  Immigration
           Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  ("the  Procedure  Rules"),  the
           judge must either accept them as such or, if there is any  issue
           raised about their genuineness, grant an adjournment so that the
           respondent can take reasonable steps to verify those documents.
        d. Therefore, having decided  to  admit  the  documents  the  judge
           should either have adjourned the appeal to enable the respondent
           to take reasonable steps to verify the documents  or  he  should
           have allowed the appeal on the basis  that  specified  documents
           had been provided and then direct the respondent to grant  leave
           unless the documents could not  be  verified  as  genuine  after
           reasonable steps had been taken to do so.


  21.  These  submissions  are,  in  our  judgement,  misconceived  for  two
      reasons. First, because they are  based  upon  a  misunderstanding  of
      paragraph 245AA. That provision is  about  the  respondent's  decision
      making process when considering an application and the  evidence  that
      had been submitted with  it.  The  time  for  that  had  passed.   The
      appellant had chosen not to  provide  the  documentary  evidence  upon
      which he sought to rely until the hearing itself so that he chose  not
      to call upon the respondent to carry out the assessment provided  for.
      There was nothing wrong with the judge doing his best to see that  the
      same process was followed in his approach to  his  assessment  of  the
      evidence.  In  any  event,  it  is  plain  from  a  reading   of   the
      determination as a whole that the judge considered and  assessed  this
      evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole and his approach in
      doing so cannot be criticised.


  22. Secondly, part of the adjudicative task performed by the judge  is  to
      make findings about the evidence.  A  document  is  not  a  "specified
      document" unless it is accepted by the judge to be what it purports to
      be.


  23. Nor should that evidence have been excluded under rule  50(7)  of  the
      Procedure Rules: the evidence had been  "made  available  to  all  the
      parties" when it was produced at a hearing at which the respondent was
      represented. Of course, if the immigration  judge  had  excluded  this
      evidence under rule 50(7), as Mr Malik appeared to be  suggesting,  or
      under rule 50(4), then the appeal would have  been  dismissed  in  any
      event.

  24. It was certainly not appropriate for the immigration judge to  adjourn
      the hearing for the respondent to consider the  material  or  to  take
      reasonable  steps  to  verify  the  documents.   Both   parties   were
      represented and neither sought an adjournment. It would be  absurd  if
      the Tribunal were considered to be  disqualified  from  proceeding  to
      determine an appeal because an appellant chose to submit at  the  last
      moment documents that lacked apparent authenticity. We do  not  accept
      that to be the position. If that submission  were  accepted  it  would
      mean that an unmeritorious in-country appellant  could  always  secure
      further time in the United Kingdom by producing false documents  to  a
      judge. To appreciate that is to realise why that proposition cannot be
      sound.

  25. Even if, which we do not find to be the case, paragraph  245AA(2)  did
      somehow require the assessment to be carried out  in  accordance  with
      its terms, then the "reasonable steps" that would  need  to  be  taken
      would be limited to what could be done at the hearing.   That  was  to
      give  the  appellant  an   opportunity   of   giving   evidence,   his
      representative an opportunity of  making  submissions  and  the  judge
      making of that whatever he did. That was precisely what did occur.

  26. Mr Malik developed his submission by saying that, following RP, it was
      not open to the judge to find that the documents were not genuine when
      no evidence  was  put  forward  by  the  respondent  to  support  that
      assertion. That presumably is a reference to  RP  (proof  of  forgery)
      Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00086 which establishes  that  an  allegation  of
      forgery needs to be proved by the person making it  and  that  a  bare
      assertion of forgery will carry no weight. At paragraph 14 of  RP  the
      Tribunal said this:
           "In judicial proceedings an allegation of forgery  needs  to  be
           established to a high degree of proof, by the person making  the
           allegation. This is therefore a matter on which  the  respondent
           bears the burden of proof. Immigration Judges  decide  cases  on
           evidence, and in the absence of any concession by the appellant,
           an Immigration Judge is not entitled to find or  assume  that  a
           document is a forgery, or to treat  it  as  a  forgery  for  the
           purposes of his determination, save on  the  basis  of  evidence
           before him. In the present case the evidence was limited to  the
           Entry Clearance Officer's assertion of  his  own  view  and  the
           defect  in  the  document  identified  in  the  notes   on   the
           application form - that is to say, the mismatch between the  run
           date and the date stamp on one of the remittance documents. That
           evidence is wholly insufficient to establish that that  document
           is a forgery...."


  27. It is important to recognise that the scheme under the  rules  is  not
      about forgery. Documents are to be rejected if there  are  reasons  to
      doubt their genuineness and it is not possible to verify that they are
      in fact genuine. A document that contains false information may not be
      a forgery but may still be one in  respect  of  which  there  is  good
      reason to doubt its genuineness. There is no  reason  to  require  any
      different process at the hearing and there is certainly no  reason  to
      require more of the Secretary of State so that advantage is secured by
      an appellant who saves dubious documents for the hearing.


  28. Here it was on the basis of the evidence  the  parties  chose  to  put
      before the immigration judge that he found he could not rely upon  the
      documentary evidence as to the truth of its contents. This was  not  a
      finding based upon a bare assertion of forgery by the  respondent  but
      upon a careful assessment of the evidence as a whole. And, as Mr Malik
      conceded, there is nothing further before us to demonstrate  that  the
      immigration judge was wrong to reach the conclusions he did.

  29. Drawing all this together  we  conclude  that  the  immigration  judge
      carried out a careful assessment of the evidence put  before  him  and
      gave clear and sufficient reasons for reaching conclusions  that  were
      plainly open to him on the evidence. He was  under  no  obligation  to
      afford the appellant a further opportunity to have documents  verified
      by  the  respondent.  His  approach  cannot   be   faulted   and   the
      determination discloses no error of law.

  30. The appeal before the Upper Tribunal is dismissed and the decision  of
      the First-tier Tribunal will stand.
