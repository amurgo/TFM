               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Rungasamy, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Mauritius who was born on 25 April  1969.
    His application for leave to remain on the basis of his family life was
    made on 17 June 2016. The application  was  refused  on  5  June  2018.
    Following a hearing on 7 February 2019 Judge Bowler ("the Judge") found
    that there was a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  relevant
    children but went on to dismiss the appeal.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Hollingworth on 8 May 2019 in
    essence saying that S117B (6)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration,  and
    Asylum Act 2002  and  Section  55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship,  and
    Immigration Act 2009 may have been misapplied in relation to the public
    interest and proportionality of requiring qualifying children to  leave
    the United Kingdom so as to remain with their father.

 3. Mr Bramble conceded that there  was  a  material  error  of  law.  Both
    representatives submitted that given the lack of  appropriate  findings
    on what the children would face in Mauritius it is not appropriate  for
    the Upper Tribunal  to  retain  this  matter  as  those  findings  were
    required before the balancing exercise could be undertaken.

Notice of Decision

 4. The matter will be remitted to Harmondsworth for a de  novo  rehearing.
    The matter will not be determined by Judge Bowler.

 5. Any further and consequential directions will be issued by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 6. No anonymity direction is made.

 7. I make no fee or costs order.
