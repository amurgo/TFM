                                I A BUCHANSKI
                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Appellant present, no legal representative
For the Respondent, Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This decision is to be read with:

      i) The respondent's  decision  dated  18  August  2016,  refusing  the
         appellant's application for leave to remain.

     ii) The appellant's grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.

    iii) The decision of FtT Judge Mill, promulgated on 26 September 2017.

     iv) The appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  UT,  stated  in  the
         application for permission to appeal dated 3 October 2017.

      v) The grant of permission by FtT Judge Ford, dated 22 March 2018.

 2. It is unfortunate that the appellant's hopes may have  been  raised  by
    the grant of permission in this case.  It is understandable that he and
    his partner might prefer to see their future in the UK, but it is  also
    obvious that there was  nothing  before  the  FtT  by  which  it  might
    rationally have been held, applying the law to the facts, that he could
    remain here either  in  compliance  with  the  immigration  rules,  or,
    exceptionally, without complying with the rules.

 3. The matter is even more obvious once it is ascertained, as Mr Buchanski
    said at the hearing, that as well as having UK nationality his  partner
    is, like him, a citizen of Australia.

 4. I advised the appellant that the appeal to the UT had to be  dismissed.
    The FtT's decision did not involve the making of any error on  a  point
    of law.

 5. It appears that the appellant made his original application in all good
    faith, but on the naï¿½ve view that although he could  not  at  the  time
    meet all the terms of the immigration rules, he was close to  doing  so
    and would perfect his case in due course.  The rules are  detailed  and
    demanding and do not allow that degree of flexibility.

 6. It may be that the appellant is now in a position, based on  length  of
    relationship and necessary income, to make a further  application  with
    good prospects of success.  However, I made  it  clear  that  any  such
    application should  be  made  promptly  and  carefully,  and  would  be
    answered by the respondent on its merits,  according  to  the  exacting
    requirements of the immigration rules, including the provision  of  all
    stipulated evidence.

 7. Any general observations made by the UT should not be taken  as  advice
    or as an indication of the outcome of a future application.  Whether to
    take professional advice remains a matter for the appellant.

 8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
