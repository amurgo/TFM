For the Appellant:     Miss S Iqbal, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Herlihy promulgated on 24th May 2018 dismissing his appeal against  the
    refusal of an application for further leave to remain on the  basis  of
    his human rights.  The Appellant appealed against that decision and was
    granted permission to appeal by Designated  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Macdonald in the following terms:

         "The grounds of application state that the Home Office  bundle  was
         only produced on the morning of the hearing which stated  that  the
         Appellant's results were 'questionable'.   It  is  said  the  Judge
         ignored evidence favourable to the Appellant in this regard and the
         Appellant was never offered a re-test.  Furthermore, the family now
         has British citizenship which had effectively been ignored  by  the
         Judge.

         While the Judge gave reasons for her decision and referred to well-
         known case law the grounds disclose  arguable  errors  in  law  for
         reasons given therein."

 2. I was not provided with a Rule 24 response from the Respondent but  was
    given the indication that the appeal was resisted.

Error of Law

 3. At the close of the hearing I reserved my decision which  I  shall  now
    give.  I do find that there is a material error of law in the decision,
    such that it should be set aside.  My reasons for  so  finding  are  as
    follows.

    Ground 1: ETS / TOEIC

 4. In terms of the grounds as they are framed, the first ground of  appeal
    challenges the judge's assessment of the allegation that the  Appellant
    has shown that the Appellant has cheated in his English  language  test
    and therefore his presence in the UK is not  conducive  to  the  public
    good (see Immigration Rule S-LTR.1.6.).

 5. In respect of this appeal, in my view it is important to bear in  mind,
    as set out in the grant of permission  above,  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's bundles were only served on the morning of the hearing and  the
    Secretary of State's evidence crucially revealed that  the  Appellant's
    results were merely "questionable".  Therefore this  factor  sets  this
    appeal quite apart from and in a different category  to  those  appeals
    where an appellant has had his ETS TOEIC test categorised as  "invalid"
    and invalidated due to the presence of a proxy test taker.  In fact, it
    is plain that on the Secretary of State's evidence, the  recordings  of
    the Appellant's test will not have been established the presence  of  a
    proxy test taker and thus the test will fall within the category  of  a
    questionable result (for one or another reason, which I shall  turn  to
    momentarily).

 6. In my view the judge has fallen into error in failing to appreciate the
    nuanced nature of  a  "questionable"  test  result  as  opposed  to  an
    "invalid" one.

 7. Looking at the Respondent's bundle, at pages 27 and 28 of  that  bundle
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  in  paragraph  47  of  the  witness
    statement of Peter Millington states therein as follows:

         "Where  a  match  has  not  been  identified   and   verified,   an
         individual's test result may still be invalidated on the  basis  of
         test administration irregularity including the fact that their test
         was taken at a UK testing centre where numerous other results  have
         been invalidated on the basis of a 'match'.   In  those  cases  the
         individual would usually be invited to take a free re-test.   These
         cases are clearly distinguished by ETS in its spreadsheets provided
         to the Home Office from tests where there is  substantial  evidence
         of invalidity."

 8. In light of that evidence from Mr Millington, further mention was  made
    of  the  distinction  between  an  invalid  and  questionable  test  at
    paragraph 29 of Miss Collings witness statement [RB/35] which states as
    follows:

         "ETS explained, at the time, that those categorised as questionable
         (as opposed to cancelled/invalid) were  inconclusive  in  terms  of
         being  certain  of  impersonation/proxy   test-taking.    Following
         further communication with ETS they  confirmed  the  definition  of
         'questionable' and this is set out in  Peter  Millington's  witness
         statement; it is  where  an  individual's  test  result  was  still
         cancelled  on  the  basis  of  test   administration   irregularity
         including the fact that their test was taken at a UK testing centre
         where numerous other results have been invalidated on the basis  of
         a 'match'.  ETS had analysed over 10,000 test scores at that point,
         of which the majority were cancelled as invalid, the remainder were
         cancelled as questionable."

 9. There was furthermore evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  in  the
    form of a Project Faï¿½ade report  concerning  Synergy  Business  College
    London which stated at paragraph 5 [RB/56] as follows:

         "Invalid and questionable TOEIC results are defined as follows:

                . Invalid - where  evidence  exists  of  proxy  test  taking
                  and/or impersonation

                . Questionable - test  takers  who  should  re-test  due  to
                  administrative irregularities".

10. Thus, in light of the evidence provided by the  Respondent  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal it is plain from the First-tier Tribunal's decision
    that the basis of the result  being  questionable  may  not  have  been
    appreciated  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.   In  her   analysis
    beginning at paragraph 19 of the decision, the judge correctly sets out
    the evidence before her and then turns to the authority of SM & Qadir v
    Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2016]  UKUT  229  (IAC),
    however she notes at paragraph 22 that "questionable"  means  that  the
    assessment of scores must be considered "doubtful" (the judge's words).
    That is an incorrect appraisal of how one should approach those with  a
    "questionable" test result following ETS' investigations.

11. I remind myself of the  assessment  by  Lord  Justice  Beatson  of  the
    distinction  between  "invalid"  and  "questionable"  test  scores   as
    summarised at [25]  and  [30]  of  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department v Shehzad & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 615 which state inter  alia
    as follows:

         "25. ...In "questionable" cases it was accepted that there may  not
         have been deception. In "invalid" cases,  this  was  not  accepted.
         That was because the voice on the audio recording of the test under
         consideration...matched the voice of someone who had taken  another
         test using a different name".

         "30.  ...in  circumstances  where  the  generic  evidence  is   not
         accompanied  by  evidence  showing  that   the   individual   under
         consideration's test was categorised as "invalid", I consider  that
         the Secretary of  State  faces  a  difficulty  in  respect  of  the
         evidential burden at the initial stage".

12. Thus, it is plain from the judge's decision that she did not appreciate
    the distinction between an "invalid" and a "questionable" test  result,
    and the implications that distinction will have for  the  Secretary  of
    State and the "difficulty" she  would  face  in  discharging  even  the
    initial evidential burden of  proof.   Thus,  this  error  alone  is  a
    material one which warrants the decision be set aside.  However,  there
    is more argument that I feel requires analysis.

13. Returning to  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
    evidnece, she notes at paragraph 23 that test  takers  should  be  "re-
    tested due to administrative irregularities" however that does not show
    an assessment of why that must follow nor is there an assessment of why
    it did not occur and the implications this had uon the Appellant.

14. Consequently, in my view, the judge has failed to place any weight upon
    the fact that the Respondent failed in her duty to permit the Appellant
    to re-sit his test in accordance with these materials.  In my  view  it
    is unclear why the Secretary of State did not invite the  Appellant  to
    re-sit his  TOEIC  test  given  this  is  the  approach  that  she  has
    previously stated she would take, but instead invited him to attend  an
    interview.  There is no reason given for this variance in approach to a
    "questionable" test.  On the one hand, where there is no evidence of  a
    test taker having used a proxy test taker, permitting a test taker  to
    re-sit his test seems fair and reasonable and would  have  the  aim  of
    testing the Appellant's English ability, albeit belatedly and  whenever
    the re-sit would be invited and  called  for.   Whereas,  an  interview
    could only be for the purposes of assessing whether the  Appellant  has
    cheated in his test, as is plain from  the  content  of  the  interview
    which the Appellant underwent and which can be seen at pages 29  to  31
    of the Appellant's bundle.  Mr Avery in  fact  accepted  this  was  the
    purpose of the interview.

15. As I say, it is unclear to me why the Appellant was not invited to  re-
    sit his English language test given that there is no  evidence  of  his
    having used a proxy test taker, but in any event it  appears  that  the
    entirety of the Secretary of State's case is based on the fact  of  the
    "questionable" outcome as stated by ETS  and  the  Appellant's  answers
    given in interview, which he states (as is his  case),  were  given  as
    comprehensively as possible and according to his memory of events  that
    occurred some five years earlier.  Thus, in my view the judge has erred
    in failing to give weight to  the  Secretary  of  State's  position  in
    failing to invite the Appellant to re-sit his test and the implications
    that that  may  have,  given  that  there  were  no  reasons  given  to
    distinguish him from other TOEIC test takers  whose  test  results  had
    been categorised as "questionable".

16. In  the  light  of  my  analysis  of  the  jurisprudence  and  evidence
    concerning ETS' designation of "invalid" test outcomes, as  opposed  to
    "questionable" outcomes, and  in the light of the  judge's  failure  to
    query and place weight upon the lack of reasons why the  Appellant  was
    not given the opportunity to re-sit his test, at paragraph  29  of  the
    decision, in my view it is perverse for the First-tier Tribunal to find
    that  the  Respondent's  evidence  of  a  questionable   test   outcome
    (confirmed via the look up tool, the statements from various  officials
    such as Miss Collings  and  Mr  Millington  and  the  contents  of  the
    supplementary bundle, the Project Faï¿½ade report) alongside the  answers
    given in interview and the evidence of the  test  being  taken  on  two
    separate dates, was sufficient to  discharge  the  initial  evidentiary
    burden of proof in establishing deception in line with the  first  hurl
    of the 'boomerang of proof'  as  mentioned  in  SM  &  Qadir  (citation
    supra).  Against the evidence that I have set out carefully above,  the
    Secretary of State's case is that migrants whose test scores have  been
    designated as "questionable" have not been said to have used proxy test
    takers but have merely sat their tests at centres where others may have
    acted fraudulently.  That is far removed from  demonstrating  deception
    on the part of this Appellant particularly where  the  voice  algorithm
    from his test does not match that of any others that would indicate the
    use of a proxy which is why his test  result  was  not  categorised  as
    "invalid".

17. Consequently, based on the evidence  that  was  provided  on  the  very
    morning of the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  I  find  that
    there are material errors of law  in  the  assessment  of  whether  the
    initial evidentiary burden of proof was established by the Secretary of
    State on the balance of probabilities.

18. Equally, although it is not complained of by the Appellant's counsel, I
    do note that as that bundle was provided on the morning of the  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal, consideration should have been given to
    the Appellant's ability to deal with the issues and the evidence raised
    by the Respondent given that the Respondent's bundle was not served  in
    compliance with the First-tier Tribunal's directions.

    Ground 2: Human Rights

19. Turning to Ground 2, I deal with this matter more succinctly in that it
    raises a classic error of law.  The complaint is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal has failed to take the previous determination  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (promulgated in  January  2016)  as  its  starting  point
    pursuant to the authority  of  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT  00702*.   The
    essence of this complaint is that at paragraphs 39 to 50, the judge  in
    her assessment of Article 8 and the proportionality of the  Appellant's
    removal, has failed to factor into her decision the previous finding of
    the First-tier Tribunal as her starting point, namely that  the  eldest
    child was granted leave by the Secretary of State on the basis that the
    First-tier Tribunal had found that it would be "unreasonable" to expect
    that child to leave the United Kingdom.  This matter  might  have  been
    immaterial if the judge had taken  the  Appellant's  position  as  even
    higher and stronger, given that the  Appellant's  wife  and  his  three
    children are now all British citizens.  As  such,  notwithstanding  the
    previous finding that it would be unreasonable for the oldest child  to
    leave the United Kingdom since January 2016, the judge should have also
    considered the Appendix FM 1.0b guidance  published  on  22nd  February
    2018 in respect of British children at pages 76 and 77 where the  child
    is a British citizen.  This guidance was published and in force at  the
    time of the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  states  as
    follows:

         Where the child is a British citizen

         Where the child is a British citizen, it will not be reasonable  to
         expect them to leave the UK with the applicant  parent  or  primary
         carer facing removal. Accordingly, where this means that the  child
         would have to leave the UK because, in  practice,  the  child  will
         not, or is not likely to, continue to live in the UK  with  another
         parent or primary carer, EX.1.(a) is likely to apply.

         In particular circumstances, it may be  appropriate  to  refuse  to
         grant leave to a parent or primary carer where their conduct  gives
         rise to public interest considerations of such weight as to justify
         their removal, where the British citizen child could remain in  the
         UK with another parent or  alternative  primary  carer,  who  is  a
         British citizen or settled in the UK or who has or is being granted
         leave to remain. The circumstances envisaged include those in which
         to grant  leave  could  undermine  our  immigration  controls,  for
         example the  applicant  has  committed  significant  or  persistent
         criminal offences falling below the thresholds for deportation  set
         out in paragraph 398 of the Immigration Rules or has  a  very  poor
         immigration history, having repeatedly  and  deliberately  breached
         the Immigration Rules.

         If the decision  maker  is  minded  to  refuse  an  application  in
         circumstances in which the applicant would then be separated from a
         child in the UK, this decision should normally be discussed with  a
         senior caseworker.

         In every case, all the circumstances must be  carefully  considered
         in the round, with the best interests of the child  constituting  a
         primary (but not the only or paramount) consideration.

20. Thus, the long and short of that guidance  is  that  the  Secretary  of
    State's public position regarding British citizen children is  that  is
    it not reasonable to expect them to leave with a parent facing  removal
    and if they would have to leave the UK with that parent, then  EX.1.(a)
    will apply in that the child's citizenship and potential  removal  with
    the parent would act as an  insurmountable  obstacle  to  the  parent's
    removal under the immigration rules (as opposed to outside the  rules).



21. In light of that guidance, it is important to turn to the  decision  of
    the Vice-President of the Upper Tribunal in SF  and  others  (Guidance,
    post-2014 Act) Albania [2017] UKUT 120(IAC)  at  paragraphs  7  to  12,
    where the guidance  in  its  previous  but  largely  similar  form  was
    considered.  In that decision, the  Upper  Tribunal  concluded  if  the
    Secretary of State were to make a decision in a person's favour on  the
    basis of his guidance, the Tribunal would also need to make a  decision
    on matters such as reasonableness consistent with decisions being  made
    in favour of individuals by the Secretary of State where he does  apply
    his guidance.  On that basis, the Upper Tribunal found that the  parent
    of a British citizen child should be granted a period of leave in order
    to enable the British citizen child to remain in the UK with them.

22. Mr Avery argued that the Appellant had been refused on the basis of  S-
    LTR.1.6. and that his cheating on his ETS TOEIC test precluded him from
    a grant of leave.  However, in my view, the error  remains  a  material
    one in respect of the human rights assessment,  as  notwithstanding  Mr
    Avery's complaint regarding the Appellant's alleged  actions  in  using
    deception in his ETS TOEIC test,  the  unreasonableness  of  a  Britich
    child's removal - as highlighted in the Appendix FM  1.0b  guidance  of
    22nd February 2018 and as referred to in its previous form  in  SF  and
    others - cannot automatically be made reasonable by virtue  of  an  ETS
    TOEIC allegation alone as the guidance specifically asks for  there  to
    be "significant or  persistent  criminal  offences  falling  below  the
    thresholds for deportation" or  that  the  migrant  "has  a  very  poor
    immigration history, having repeatedly and  deliberately  breached  the
    Immigration Rules".

23. By comparison, in the lesser context of whether it would be  reasonable
    for a third country national child  whom  had  resided  in  the  United
    Kingdom for a continious period of 7 years, to leave the United Kingdom
    along with its family, the recent decision of the Upper Tribunal in the
    Presidential Panel's decision in MT and ET (child's best interests;  ex
    tempore pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 88 (IAC) at [33] to [34]  identifies
    that there were would need to be "powerful reasons" for that removal to
    be reasonable.  Albeit this finding is made in respect of the  guidance
    concerning a child who is not British, even in  this  lesser  scenario,
    when searching for "powerful reasons" the Panel were confronted with an
    Appellant who had abused the immigration laws of the UK and had at some
    stage received a community order for using a false document  to  obtain
    employment.  However, even on those facts, and when faced with  a  non-
    citizen child, the panel found that that evidence was  insufficient  to
    form a "powerful reason" for the child and its family's removal.   That
    is not dispositive of but may be relevant in the assessment of  whether
    a British child's removal or that of their parent is reasonable  where,
    implicitly, more than a "powerful reason" must surely be required.

24. As such, in light of the errors found in respect of the  assessment  of
    the ETS TOEIC assessment,  the  second  ground  identifies  a  material
    error, and even if the first ground were not  made  out,  the  decision
    fails to grapple with whether the removal of the British  children,  or
    separation from their father in the alternative, is reasonable in light
    of the Appendix FM  1.0b  guidance  which  sets  a  high  standard  for
    demonstrating that  reasonableness  in  the  light  of  the  children's
    citizenship.

25. As such, upon  remittal,  it  will  be  necessary  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to assess whether the ETS TOEIC allegation is proven,  and  if
    it is, whether it makes the removal of the  British  children  and  the
    Appellant reasonable,  or  whether  it  makes  the  separation  of  the
    Appellant from his wife and children  in  light  of  Appendix  FM  1.0b
    reasonable (if that separation from the British wife  and  children  is
    feasible in the first place).

26. In light of the above findings I set aside the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal in its entirety.
