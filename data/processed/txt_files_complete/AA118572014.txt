                                   Between

                                     MMJ
                          (anonymity direction made)

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A. Faryl,  Counsel instructed by Broudie Jackson
                       Canter
For the Respondent:    Mr G. Harrison,  Senior Home Office Presenting
                       Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Somalia born in 1989.


 2. Having had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity
    Orders I consider it appropriate to make  an  order  in  the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


 3. In a determination dated 22nd May 2015 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Davies)  dismissed the Appellant's appeal, on asylum and  human  rights
    grounds,  against a decision to refuse him leave to enter.


    Error of Law


 4. On the 20th January 2016 the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    set aside by consent. The Secretary of State was that  day  represented
    by Mr A. McVeety who conceded that the determination contained material
    errors of law. The First-tier Tribunal had found the Appellant to be  a
    credible witness and had  accepted  the  account  he  had  given.  This
    included having been persecuted by Al-Shabaab in the past, and the fact
    that his sister worked for an NGO. Neither of these  factors  had  been
    considered in the context of the future risk assessment.  For instance,
    in respect of the former the determination read:


         "There is nothing in the Appellant's background to suggest that  he
         has a profile which would mean that he would  be  targeted  by  Al-
         Shabaab. The Appellant has no profile whatsoever"


    Mr McVeety agreed that this  conclusion  did  not  sit  well  with  the
    accepted findings that in 2008 Al-Shabaab had  tried  to  pressure  the
    Appellant into becoming a suicide bomber, had kidnapped him, threatened
    to kill him and had injured him so badly that he was  hospitalised  for
    three months. Those being the accepted facts, the proper approach would
    have been to apply paragraph 339K of the Immigration  Rules  and  treat
    that past persecution as a "serious indication" of future risk,  absent
    a material change in circumstances.  Whilst Mr McVeety maintained  that
    the appeal may in the final analysis fall to be dismissed, he  accepted
    that it was an error not to examine these possible  risk  factors  with
    anxious scrutiny.


 5. I agreed. The decision was therefore set aside to that extent. In  view
    of the positive credibility findings made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (in respect of both the Appellant and his sister F who gave  evidence),
    unchallenged by the  Respondent,  the  re-made  risk  assessment  would
    proceed on the  basis  of  the  account  set  out  in  the  Appellant's
    statement and accepted by the Tribunal:


               . The Appellant is from the minority Ashraf clan (Sarman sub-
                 clan)
               . His place of former habitual residence was Jowhar,  a  town
                 in the Middle Shabelle, north of Mogadishu
               . The Appellant has no skills or  profession.  He  spent  his
                 time playing and coaching football. He did not get paid but
                 he used kit provided by Medecin San Frontiers (MSF)
               . In 2008 Al-Shabaab were rising in profile in Jowhar.    Al-
                 Shabaab came to the  Appellant's  family  home  along  with
                 Hawiye militiamen and threatened the family that they  must
                 desist from practising Sufism. They  shot  and  killed  his
                 father, assaulted his mother (cutting off part of  her  ear
                 in the process) and shot and injured the Appellant  in  his
                 leg
               . The Appellant spent three months  in  an  NGO  hospital  in
                 Jowhar
               . After the attack the Appellant's two brothers fled  Jowhar.
                 One is now in Djibouti, the other is missing
               . One of the Appellant's sisters was taken by Al-Shabaab  and
                 forced to marry one of their fighters. The  last  he  heard
                 she had three children. Another sister went missing and  is
                 now living in Norway as a refugee. The third (F)  is in the
                 UK with her husband and four children
               . Later in 2008 a friend of the Appellant's was kidnapped and
                 brainwashed by Al-Shabaab. This friend  tried  to  persuade
                 the Appellant to become a suicide bomber.   This friend was
                 later executed by Al-Shabaab for his failure  to  become  a
                 suicide bomber himself
               . Al-Shabaab twice visited the family home  looking  for  the
                 Appellant.  They let it be known that they were  not  happy
                 about him providing football coaching  to  local  boys  and
                 that it was considered un-Islamic
               . The Appellant was concerned for his  safety  in  Jowhar  so
                 started spending time with a Sheikh in some nearby villages


               . In 2013 these villages were burned down in fighting between
                 the Abgal and some other clans
               . In January 2014 the  Appellant  managed  to  leave  Somalia
                 after his mother sold  the  family  land  to  pay  for  his
                 journey
               . The Appellant's sister who is in the UK (F) worked for  MSF
                 between 1991 and 2005 and from 2006 worked in Mogadishu for
                 a South African charity called  Young  Christian  Students.
                 She  encountered  problems  because   of   this   charity's
                 religious affiliations and evangelism and left the  country
                 within the year. She has not returned to Somalia since
               . Their mother is living in a refugee camp
               . F is living on benefits in the UK and would  be  unable  to
                 provide  the  Appellant  with  any  support  should  he  be
                 returned




    The Re-Made Decision


 6. I find as fact that the Appellant has suffered past persecution at  the
    hands of Al-Shabaab and the Hawiye (Abgal) militia in his home area  of
    Jowhar. This included  physical  assault,  psychological  pressure  and
    assault/murder of family members.


 7. My starting point is therefore that having suffered serious harm in the
    past the Appellant is reasonably likely to do so again in  the  future,
    absent a change in circumstances such that there are  good  reasons  to
    believe that such harm  would  not  re-occur:  paragraph  339K  of  the
    Immigration Rules, Demirkaya v SSHD [1999] EWCA Civ 1654.

 8. In 2008 the Appellant's home area of Jowhar was  ostensibly  under  the
    control of Somali government troops, backed by  African  Union  forces.
    The town came under increasing pressure from Al-Shabaab however and  it
    fell in 2009.   During the time that they were  in  control  Al-Shabaab
    imposed strict Islamic punishments and human rights abuses against  the
    local population, such as those described by the Appellant.

 9. Since 2011  the  Somali  government  has  significantly  increased  its
    control over southern and central Somalia,  thanks  to  an  ANISOM  led
    offensive: Jowhar was recaptured by Somali government  forces  in  late
    2012[1].    This has  forced  a  change  of  tactics,  with  Al-Shabaab
    increasingly reverting to guerrilla tactics to assault  government  and
    international targets[2].  The First-tier  Tribunal   accepted  however
    that it was likely that Al-Shabaab retain a presence in Jowhar and that
    finding  is  supported  by  the  country  background  information,  for
    instance the Danish Fact Finding Mission cited  in  the  CIG  of  March
    2016:

         'Several towns in S/C Somalia have a presence  of  AMISOM/SNAF  and
         other armed actors following recent offensives  in  2014.  However,
         compared by sheer mileage, the  majority  of  the  surface  of  S/C
         Somalia is still controlled by Al  Shabaab,  especially  the  rural
         areas between towns with AMISOM/SNAF presence.


         'As of May 2015, a number of sources considered that Al Shabaab was
         no  longer  in  control  in  several  towns  in  S/C  Somalia  with
         AMISOM/SNAF presence. However, while Al Shabaab was  no  longer  in
         control of any of these towns' administrative  zones,  it  retained
         the capability to carry out asymmetric  warfare  through  guerrilla
         style attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and vehicle
         borne IEDs, as well as targeted  assassinations  against  prominent
         individuals.


         'Further, the same sources emphasized that AMISOM/SNAF  forces  and
         Al  Shabaab  continue  to  engage  in  recurrent   battles,   armed
         confrontations  and  violent  attacks  over  territory  within  the
         immediate outskirts of a city, with surrounding  villages  changing
         hands intermittently in response to retreats and  regroupings  from
         both sides....


         'Information suggesting that as of May 2015,  the  towns  of  Xudur
         (Bakool), Dhobley (Lower Juba) and  Jowhar  (Middle  Shabelle)  had
         AMISOM/SNAF presence was provided by one source each...


         'According to UNHCR Somalia, Al Shabaab is present in much  of  the
         territory of S/C Somalia, including in those areas in  the  control
         of AMISOM/SNAF. In this regard, Al Shabaab often maintains presence
         at the outskirts of many towns and  in  village  communities  where
         AMISOM/SNAF and Somali government structures exist in S/C  Somalia.
         Some cities with AMISOM/SNAF presence could be described as islands
         in Al Shabaab territory.  Therefore  many  towns  with  AMISOM/SNAF
         presence are still difficult to access by road since Al Shabaab  is
         often present in the surrounding areas  and  has  established  both
         fixed and ad hoc checkpoints on the main supply routes (MSR).'

10. As to possible targets for Al Shabaab violence the US State  Department
    (again cited in the CIG) find the first in the firing line to be Somali
    government officials, ANISOM troops, and international  targets,  which
    can include representatives of NGOs or the UN. The  organisation  tends
    to be cautious in attacking avoid local civilians such as  tea  sellers
    because it wants to avoid becoming deeply unpopular.  It  will  however
    still target those who are perceived to be opposed to it [at 5.1.2]:


         Al-Shabaab continued to kill civilians. This  included  politically
         motivated killings that  targeted  civilians  affiliated  with  the
         government and attacks on humanitarians, NGO employees,  UN  staff,
         and diplomatic missions. Al-Shabaab  often  used  suicide  attacks,
         mortar attacks, and improvised explosive devices.  It  also  killed
         prominent peace activists,  community  leaders,  clan  elders,  and
         their family members for their roles  in  peace  building,  and  it
         beheaded persons accused  of  spying  for  and  collaborating  with
         Somali national forces and affiliated militias.'


         'In addition, one source mentioned representatives from educational
         institutions, persons believed to be collaborating with  or  spying
         for the government, people who refuse to pay tax to  Al-Shabaab  or
         business people refusing to pay money demanded by Al-Shabaab.


         'One source stated that Al Shabaab  do  not  prioritize  low  level
         targets, such as local staff from international or  national  NGOs,
         but if no preferred high profile targets such as AMISOM or  the  UN
         is available, they will go for  an  available  low  profile  target
         instead.


         'Several sources agreed that civilians are not directly targeted by
         Al Shabaab. However, ordinary civilians  are  often  killed,  as  a
         consequence of Al Shabaab's  attacks  on  their  targets  in  often
         populated areas with the  use  of  IEDs,  suicide  bombs  and  hand
         grenades.'

11. There is further information to suggest  that  'ordinary'  Somalis  can
    face risks in contact with Al Shabaab. The UNHCR Position on Returns to
    Southern  and  Central  Somalia  (23rd  May  2016)   notes   that   the
    organisation continues to be responsible for  a  wide  range  of  grave
    human rights abuses, including  extrajudicial  killing,  abduction  and
    forced recruitment [at 6]. There has  been  a  reported  focus  on  the
    eradication of what Al Shabaab regard as collaborators and spies.   The
    CIG states:

         6.1.5 Sources within the same report also noted that particular
         groups at risk when travelling from Al Shabaab controlled areas to
         areas with AMISOM/SNAF presence could include but are not limited
         to youths, in particular young men, women and government supporters
         or those perceived as such. The sources quoted stated:


         'Youth in particular are at risk when travelling to and from Al
         Shabaab controlled areas as they are targeted to join Al Shabaab or
         militias.


         'The risk facing Somalis from abroad returning  to  an  Al  Shabaab
         controlled area depends on the profile  of  the  person  returning.
         There is a concern that  Al  Shabaab  might  target  intellectuals,
         human rights  activists,  business  people  and  those  potentially
         looking as possible future government leaders or  those  supporting
         or sympathizing with the government or perceived to do so. Ordinary
         Somalis would not be targets as such, but they  could  be  followed
         and spied upon by Al Shabaab.'


12. I bear in mind that it has  been  a  relatively  long  time  since  the
    Appellant had any direct contact with Al Shabaab.  I  further  bear  in
    mind that the situation has changed to the  extent  that  they  are  no
    longer in control of  Jowhar.  I  remain  concerned  however  that  the
    organisation continues to have a presence in the rural areas and in the
    outskirts of towns such as Jowhar. The Appellant would be returning  to
    the area as a young man with no immediately obvious  affiliations.   He
    is someone who in the  past  was  perceived  to  be  'opposed'  to  the
    organisation inasmuch as he was someone who declined to  join  it,  and
    his family were punished for their commitment to  Sufism.  The  extreme
    violence that was perpetrated against the Appellant and his family also
    occurred at a time when Al Shabaab were not formally in charge  of  the
    town, but were rather operating as a guerrilla force on the  periphery,
    just as now.  With those factors in mind  I  am  satisfied  that  there
    would be a real risk that the Appellant would face serious harm at  the
    hands of Al Shabaab today. The factors increasing  his  risk  over  and
    above that of the population at large are  the  past  persecution,  the
    fact that he is a young man of fighting age, and the fact  that  he  is
    returning to the area and so would be open to accusations of espionage.
      I have made those findings without reference to  the  fact  that  his
    sister was employed by various NGOs in the area; whilst  I  do  exclude
    the possibility that these might place her relations at risk there does
    not appear, on the facts presented, to have been any  problems  in  the
    past as a result of association with F.


13. The Respondent's case is  that  notwithstanding  any  risk  that  might
    pertain to the Appellant getting to or living in Jowhar, the  Appellant
    is not entitled to international protection because  he  could  go  and
    live in Mogadishu. The position for those seeking  internal  flight  in
    the capital was considered by the Upper Tribunal in MOJ &  Ors  (Return
    to Mogadishu) Somalia CG  [2014]  UKUT  00442  (IAC)  in  a  series  of
    hearings between February and September 2014. The  central  conclusions
    are set out at (ii) to (xii) of the headnote:

   (ii)             Generally, a person who is "an ordinary civilian" (i.e.
         not associated with the security forces; any aspect  of  government
         or  official   administration   or   any   NGO   or   international
         organisation) on returning to Mogadishu after a period  of  absence
         will face no real risk of persecution or risk of harm  such  as  to
         require protection under Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15(c)  of
         the Qualification Directive. In particular, he will not be at  real
         risk simply on account of having lived in a European location for a
         period of time  of  being  viewed  with  suspicion  either  by  the
         authorities as a possible supporter of Al Shabaab or by Al  Shabaab
         as  an  apostate  or  someone  whose  Islamic  integrity  has  been
         compromised by living in a Western country.


   (iii)           There has been durable change in the sense that  the  Al
         Shabaab withdrawal from Mogadishu is complete and there is no  real
         prospect of a re-established presence within the city. That was not
         the case at the time of the country guidance given by the  Tribunal
         in AMM.


   (iv)           The level of civilian casualties, excluding non-military
         casualties that clearly fall within Al Shabaab target  groups  such
         as politicians, police officers,  government  officials  and  those
         associated with NGOs and  international  organisations,  cannot  be
         precisely  established  by  the  statistical  evidence   which   is
         incomplete and  unreliable.  However,  it  is  established  by  the
         evidence considered as a whole that there has been a  reduction  in
         the level of civilian casualties since 2011,  largely  due  to  the
         cessation  of  confrontational  warfare  within  the  city  and  Al
         Shabaab's resort to  asymmetrical  warfare  on  carefully  selected
         targets.  The present level of casualties  does  not  amount  to  a
         sufficient risk to ordinary  civilians  such  as  to  represent  an
         Article 15(c) risk.


   (v)            It is open to an ordinary citizen of Mogadishu to  reduce
         further still his personal exposure  to  the  risk  of  "collateral
         damage" in being caught up in an Al Shabaab  attack  that  was  not
         targeted at him by  avoiding  areas  and  establishments  that  are
         clearly identifiable as likely Al Shabaab targets, and  it  is  not
         unreasonable for him to do so.


   (vi)           There is no real risk of forced recruitment to Al Shabaab
         for civilian citizens of Mogadishu, including for recent  returnees
         from the West.


   (vii)         A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of  absence
         will look to his nuclear family, if he has one living in the  city,
         for  assistance  in  re-establishing   himself   and   securing   a
         livelihood. Although a returnee may also seek assistance  from  his
         clan members who are not close relatives, such help is only  likely
         to be forthcoming for majority clan members, as minority clans  may
         have little to offer.


   (viii)      The  significance  of  clan  membership  in  Mogadishu  has
         changed. Clans now provide, potentially, social support  mechanisms
         and assist  with  access  to  livelihoods,  performing  less  of  a
         protection function than previously. There are no clan militias  in
         Mogadishu, no clan  violence,  and  no  clan  based  discriminatory
         treatment, even for minority clan members.


   (ix)           If it is accepted that  a  person  facing  a  return  to
         Mogadishu after a period of absence has no nuclear family or  close
         relatives in the city to assist him in re-establishing  himself  on
         return, there will need to be a careful assessment of  all  of  the
         circumstances. These  considerations  will  include,  but  are  not
         limited to:


      �       circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
      �       length of absence from Mogadishu;
      �       family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;
      �       access to financial resources;
      �      prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be employment
         or self employment;
      �       availability of remittances from abroad;
      �       means of support during the time spent in the United Kingdom;
      �       why his ability to fund the journey to  the  West  no  longer
         enables an appellant to secure financial support on return.


   (x)             Put another way, it will be for the person facing return
         to explain why  he  would  not  be  able  to  access  the  economic
         opportunities  that  have  been  produced  by  the  economic  boom,
         especially as there is evidence to the effect  that  returnees  are
         taking jobs at the expense of those who have never been away.


   (xi)           It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or  family
         support who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad  and
         who have no real prospect of securing access  to  a  livelihood  on
         return who will  face  the  prospect  of  living  in  circumstances
         falling below that which is acceptable in  humanitarian  protection
         terms.


   (xii)         The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those
         who originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return to  live
         in the city without being subjected to an  Article  15(c)  risk  or
         facing a real risk of destitution. On the other hand, relocation in
         Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan  with no former links  to
         the city, no access to funds and no other form of clan,  family  or
         social support is unlikely to be realistic as, in  the  absence  of
         means to establish a  home  and  some  form  of  ongoing  financial
         support there will be a real risk of having no alternative  but  to
         live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a
         real possibility of having to live in conditions   that  will  fall
         below acceptable humanitarian standards.

14. On the question of risk in Mogadishu this guidance clearly points to it
    being below the threshold required to engage the Refugee Convention. Ms
    Faryl was unable to point to any recent material which  could  lead  to
    different conclusions as to the general security situation in the city.
    I am satisfied, having regard to (ii) to (vi) above, that the Appellant
    would not face a real risk  of  serious  harm  in  Mogadishu,  from  Al
    Shabaab infiltrators or anyone else. Whilst there remains a possibility
    of attacks being launched in the city there is no evidence  to  support
    the  contention  that  individuals  such  as  the  Appellant  would  be
    targeted.


15. The question remains whether it would be reasonable to  expect  him  to
    relocate internally: AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49. That is not a  test  to
    be equated with Article 3 ECHR. The question is whether the  individual
    will be able to live a "relatively normal life without undue hardship".
     I remind myself  of  the  following  salient  facts  relating  to  the
    Appellant:

        . He is from the minority Ashraf clan
        . He has no known connections with the city
        . His mother is in a refugee camp
        . His siblings have all left Somalia or are whereabouts unknown
        . His father is deceased
        . He is a healthy adult male
        . His prospects of being able to rely on  remittances  from  abroad
          are low (both sisters are supporting their own  families  on  low
          incomes)

16. Having regard to the guidance in MOJ I find as follows.  The  Appellant
    does not have any close family in Mogadishu to whom he could  look  for
    assistance in re-establishing himself in  Somalia.  Although  he  would
    face no risk as a member of a  minority  clan,  the  relevance  of  his
    Ashraf identity is that he may find  difficulty  in  receiving  support
    from clan members, since they themselves are likely to be living on the
    margins and  may  have  little  to  offer.  Although  I  have  no  real
    information about his sister in Norway I accept that his sister F would
    be unlikely to be able to give him any regular support.  His mother  is
    living in an IDP camp. All of these factors would tend to indicate that
    the Appellant is going to face substantial challenges  to  establishing
    himself in Mogadishu. There remains however  the  fact  that  he  is  a
    healthy young man who would be able to work. The  evidence  before  the
    Tribunal in MOJ was  that  there  was  an  economic  boom  underway  in
    Mogadishu with plenty of opportunities for low skilled  employment.  At
    408 the Tribunal in MOJ sums up its findings as follows:


         "It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or  family  support
         who will not be in receipt of remittances from abroad and who  have
         no real prospect of securing access to a livelihood on  return  who
         will face the prospect of living  in  circumstances  falling  below
         that which is acceptable in humanitarian protection terms".


    On the evidence before me I cannot be satisfied that the  Appellant  is
    someone who will have  "no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
    livelihood".


17. It follows that the appeal must be dismissed, in  accordance  with  the
    guidance in MOJ. This  is  an  Appellant  who  has  been  found  to  be
    credible, and who has suffered atrocious persecution in the past. He is
    however a young man who would be able to relocate within Mogadishu  and
    take advantage of the "economic boom" there.  He  will  no  doubt  face
    significant challenges in doing that,  but  these  are  not  such  that
    internal flight would be rendered unsafe or "unduly harsh".

      Decisions


18. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside to the extent
    identified above.


19. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:


    The appeal is dismissed on all grounds.


20. There is an anonymity order in force.
