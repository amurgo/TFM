For the Appellant:           Mr R Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:          Mr Boyd, Temple & Co


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  a  determination  by
   Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Juliet  Grant-Hutchison  allowing  an
   appeal  by  Mr Prithviraj  Sarkar  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  "the
   applicant".)  The appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was brought against a
   decision dated 18 April 2013 by  the  Secretary  of  State  refusing  the
   applicant leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  under  the
   Points Based System.

2) The applicant's position is that  he  is  a  director  and  the  majority
   shareholder of a company called Connect-IN Ltd.  The sum of  �40,000  has
   been invested in this company by Gabriel Investments Ltd.   In  addition,
   the applicant had over �10,000  in  his  personal  account  available  to
   invest in the company.  On the basis of these  two  sums,  the  applicant
   maintained that he had available to invest or had invested �50,000 in his
   business.  The issue in the appeal was whether the  �40,000  invested  in
   the business by a third party, which  was  money  which  had  never  been
   through the hands of the applicant himself, albeit that he was a director
   of the business, could count towards  the  total  of  �50,000  which  the
   applicant was required to invest in the  business  either  from  his  own
   resources or from a third party.

3) In the view of the Secretary of State,  where  relevant  funds  had  been
   invested in a UK business before the date of the application for leave to
   remain, as they had in this case, then in terms  of  paragraph  46-SD  of
   Appendix A of the Immigration Rules the applicant could not rely on  this
   money as part of the investment of �50,000 required under the Rules.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

4) The Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  a  thorough  and  careful
   determination, in which she addressed this point.  At paragraph 19 of her
   determination she quoted  from  the  Secretary  of  State's  reasons  for
   refusal letter, in which it was stated "that any accounts submitted  must
   show the investment made by the applicant in his  own  name."   She  then
   quoted the following requirements from paragraph 46-SD(b):

    "Audited or unaudited accounts must show the investment in  money  made
    directly by the applicant, in his  own  name  or  on  his  behalf  (and
    showing his name).  If he has invested by way  of  share  capital,  the
    business accounts must show the shareholders, the amount and  value  of
    the shares (on the date of purchase) in  the  applicant's  name  as  it
    appears in his application.  If the  value  of  the  applicant's  share
    capital is not shown in the accounts, then share certificates  must  be
    submitted as documentary evidence.  The accounts must clearly show  the
    name of the accountant, the date the accounts were  produced,  and  how
    much the applicant has invested in the business."


5) At paragraph 20 of the determination the judge found that  the  applicant
   had not made any investment as yet in his own name or on his own  behalf.
   The investment had been made by a third party, Gabriel  Investments  Ltd,
   directly into the company of Connect-IN Ltd, in return  for  a  share  of
   future profits.  The judge found that in these circumstances paragraph 46-
   SD(b)  did  not  apply.   Further  requirements  in  paragraph   46-SD(c)
   similarly did not apply.  In reaching this conclusion the judge  referred
   to paragraph 45 of Appendix A, which states the following:

    "If the applicant has invested the money referred to in Table 4 in  the
    UK before the date of the application, points will be awarded for funds
    available as if the applicant had not yet invested the funds, providing
    the investment was made no more than 12 months before the date  of  the
    application  and  the  specified  documents  in  paragraph  46-SD   are
    provided."


6) The judge observed that the sum  of  �40,000  was  not  invested  by  the
   applicant but by Gabriel Investments Ltd and credited to the bank account
   of Connect-IN Ltd.  It was referred to  in  the  management  accounts  of
   Connect-IN Ltd for the period from 1 July 2012 to 28 February 2013  under
   the heading "Capital and Reserves".  The applicant did  not  receive  the
   money personally to pass on to the company.  Because the  money  was  not
   invested by the applicant paragraphs 45 and 46-SD of Appendix A  did  not
   apply.

7) Having decided that paragraphs 45 and 46-SD of Appendix A did not  apply,
   the judge then went  on  to  consider  the  alternative  requirements  of
   paragraphs 41 and 41-SD of Appendix A.  Paragraph 41(d) refers  to  money
   available to the applicant and the judge observed that this meant  funds:


    (1)    in the applicant's own possession;
        2) in the financial accounts of a UK incorporated business of which
           he is the director, or
        3)  available  from  the  third  party  or  parties  named  in  the
           application in  terms  referred  to  in  paragraph  41-SD(b)  of
           Appendix A.

8) The judge noted that the �40,000 invested by Gabriel Investments Ltd  was
   detailed in the accounts prepared by a certified accountant for  Connect-
   IN Ltd, which was itself an incorporated company of which  the  applicant
   was a director.   This  was  sufficient  to  show  that  the  funds  were
   available to the applicant under paragraph 41-SD.

9) In support of this argument  the  judge  referred  to  the  Secretary  of
   State's policy guidance in respect of applications made on  or  after  31
   January 2013, which had been submitted on behalf of the applicant.  Under
   Section d of this guidance, where an application has been made  following
   on from leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)  Migrant  (which  applies  in
   respect of the  applicant),  and  access  to  �50,000  is  required,  the
   guidance states at paragraph 48 that "this money  can  be  made  up  from
   money already invested in  the  business  together  with  access  to  any
   balance of money needed to total �50,000."

10) Having regard to paragraph 41-SD(d) and to the associated  guidance  the
   judge found that the �40,000  invested  by  Gabriel  Investments  Ltd  in
   Connect-IN Ltd did constitute funds available to the applicant.  To  this
   could be added a sum of more than  �11,000  available  to  the  applicant
   according to bank statements in his own name.  Accordingly the judge  was
   satisfied that the applicant had access to the required �50,000  to  make
   up a score of 75 required in order to qualify  for  leave  as  a  Tier  1
   (Entrepreneur) Migrant.

11) The judge then went on to say that for the reasons  she  had  given  she
   did not accept the reasons for refusal relied upon by  the  Secretary  of
   State.  The judge further stated that the  Secretary  of  State  had  not
   discharged the burden of proof and the reasons given  by  the  respondent
   did not justify the refusal.  The Secretary of State's decision  was  not
   in accordance with the law and the Immigration Rules.

Application for permission to appeal

12) The application for permission to appeal on behalf of the  Secretary  of
   State was based on two grounds.  The first of these was  that  the  judge
   erred by concluding that company funds were the same for the sake of  the
   Rules as those held by the applicant himself.   The  Secretary  of  State
   pointed out that the funds of the company were not automatically those of
   the directors.  The second ground was that the  judge  appeared  to  have
   applied the wrong burden of proof by stating that the Secretary of  State
   had not discharged the burden of proof and that the reasons given by  the
   Secretary of State did not justify the refusal.  Permission  was  granted
   on both these grounds.

Consideration by the Upper Tribunal

13) The starting point for our consideration of the appeal  is  the  finding
   made by the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  the  effect  that  the
   applicant had �10,000 to invest from his  personal  bank  statements  and
   another �40,000 already invested in the company.  This latter sum was not
   invested by the applicant but  the  applicant  was  a  director  and  the
   majority shareholder of the company.

14) For the Secretary of State Mr Parkinson referred to paragraph  41(d)  of
   Appendix A, which sets out the circumstances in which an  applicant  will
   be considered to have access  to  funds.   Sub-paragraph  (d)  states  as
   follows:

    "The money will remain available to the applicant until such time as it
    is spent in the establishment or running of the applicant's business or
    businesses.  "Spent"  excludes  spending   on   the   applicant's   own
    remuneration.  The UK Border  Agency  reserves  the  right  to  request
    further evidence  or  otherwise  verify  that  the  money  will  remain
    available, and to refuse  the  application  if  this  evidence  is  not
    provided or it is unable to satisfactorily verify.  "Available to  him"
    means that the funds are:


        1) in his own possession,


        2) in the financial accounts of a UK incorporated business of which
           he is the director, or

        3)  available  from  the  third  party  or  parties  named  in  the
           application under the terms of the declaration(s) referred to in
           paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A."

15) The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal found, of course, that the  �40,000
   in question was in the financial accounts of a UK  incorporated  business
   of which the applicant was a director.  Before us Mr Parkinson sought  to
   argue that the reference in paragraph 41(d)(2) to  "the  director"  meant
   the sole or only director.  In reply Mr Boyd submitted that this  was  an
   attempt to read into the Rules  something  which  was  not  there.   This
   provision was compared with Table 4(d)(iii), which refers specifically to
   "a director".  Mr Parkinson submitted that Table 4(d) was concerned  with
   a qualifying requirement of the Rules  but  the  provision  in  paragraph
   41(d) was concerned with the source of the funds relied  upon  and  hence
   the use of the term "the director".

16) It was pointed out that according to paragraph 41(d) the money  must  be
   available to the business and must not be used for the maintenance of the
   applicant. Mr Parkinson confirmed that the money must be available to the
   applicant or to the entrepreneurial team for business use.

17) On behalf of the applicant, Mr Boyd submitted that  the  company  was  a
   very successful one but was in difficulty because of the refusal decision
   and the appeal.   The  company  continued  to  attract  funding  and  had
   shareholdings  from  Scottish  Enterprise  and   Strathclyde   University
   amounting to a further sum of �100,000.

18) For our part we accept that there might possibly be  some  merit  in  Mr
   Parkinson's argument relying on the use of the  term  "the  director"  in
   paragraph 41(d) rather than the term "a director" as in Table  4,  though
   it strikes us as unlikely that paragraph 41(d)(2) was intended  to  apply
   only to companies with a single director without that  being  made  clear
   separately.  This, however, is not a matter which we need to consider  in
   the context of this appeal.  It  was  not  raised  in  the  Secretary  of
   State's grounds for permission to  appeal.   Those  grounds  stated  that
   company funds were not the same for the purpose of  the  Rules  as  funds
   held by the applicant and that company holdings  were  not  automatically
   those of the company's directors.  This latter observation is, of course,
   entirely correct, although of no relevance to the outcome of the  appeal.
   The point made by the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, however, was that
   the investment of �40,000 made in the company of which the applicant is a
   director and the majority shareholder constituted funds available to  the
   applicant for the purpose of showing available  funds  of  �50,000  under
   Appendix A.  We consider that for the reasons given by the judge, she was
   entitled to make this finding and we see no reason on the  basis  of  the
   grounds before us to overturn the judge's interpretation of these complex
   rules.

19) The second point relied upon in the Secretary  of  State's  grounds  was
   rightly not argued before us by Mr Parkinson.  The use by  the  judge  of
   the phrase relating to the  burden  of  proof  in  paragraph  25  of  the
   determination is a regrettable slip of the pen but it has  no  impact  on
   the outcome of the appeal, particularly as the facts were not in  dispute
   and the judge's reasoning was entirely adequate.

Conclusions

20) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve
   the making of an error on a point of law.

21) We do not set aside the decision.
