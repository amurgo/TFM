For the Appellant:           Ms S. Widdison, Counsel instructed by direct
access
For the Respondent:    Mrs H. Aboni, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Albania born in 1990.   Her dependent is
    her daughter who is now aged 4.   She pursues an appeal on human rights
    grounds, submitting, with reference to paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
    Immigration Rules, that there are very  significant  obstacles  to  her
    integration in Albania; she further submits that her  private  life  in
    the United Kingdom is such that the  refusal  to  grant  her  leave  to
    remain amounts to a disproportionate interference with it.


 2. The appeal comes before me as a result  of  my  decision  of  the  24th
    September 2018, when  I  found  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Brookfield) had erred in law in her approach to Article 8. A copy of my
    'error of law' decision is appended, but in brief my reasons were  that
    the Tribunal had failed to consider  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  at  all:
    this being the starting point for any consideration of Article  8,  the
    decision was flawed for material error. Further I noted that the First-
    tier Tribunal's reasoning on Article  8  'outside  of  the  rules'  had
    turned on whether the Appellant and her daughter would have the support
    of their natal family if they returned to Albania. At its paragraph  10
    (xvi) the Tribunal found:

         "... I find the evidence before me suggests there is  a  reasonable
         degree of likelihood she would be able to return to live  with  her
         family in Shkoder and that her family would financially support her
         on her return to Albania".

    This finding is flawed for two errors in approach. First, the  Tribunal
    here apparently failed to have regard to material  evidence,  that  the
    Appellant and her  family  are  now  in  fact  estranged.  Second,  the
    reasoning is premised on an inversion of the standard of proof.  If  it
    is only reasonably  likely  that  her  family  will  support  her,  the
    Appellant has made out her case - on the lower  standard  -  that  they
    will not.


 3. For these reasons the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,  insofar  as  it
    related to Article 8, was set aside to  be  remade,  and  this  is  the
    matter now before me.


 4. I record for the sake of completeness that the First-tier Tribunal also
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal on protection  grounds,  finding  that
    whatever subjective fear she may have in respect of living in  Albania,
    that fear is not objectively well-founded,  since  the  authorities  in
    Albania are generally willing and able  to  provide  a  sufficiency  of
    protection against domestic violence and criminality:  DM  (sufficiency
    of protection - PSG - women -  domestic  violence)  Albania  CG  [2004]
    UKIAT 00059.   I found no reason to interfere in that decision  and  it
    is upheld.


    Anonymity


 5. This case concerns the human rights and best interests of a  minor.   I
    have had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity
    Orders and I consider it appropriate to make an order in the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"


    The Factual Matrix


 6. The First-tier Tribunal found that the  Appellant  had  discharged  the
    burden of proof in respect of the following matters.


 7. The Appellant is from a working class family from a  town  in  northern
    Albania, Shkoder.  Although her  family  are,  in  keeping  with  their
    origins, socially and religiously conservative, they permitted  her  to
    attend university and wanted her to pursue a career and  marry  someone
    educated. So it was that in 2009 when she  met  a  local  man  who  was
    largely uneducated, her family were not approving. His family were  not
    happy either since they had wanted to arrange a marriage for  him,  but
    he and the Appellant were in love and decided to  get  married  against
    the wishes of their respective families.


 8. Not  long  after  the  marriage  the  Appellant's  husband's  behaviour
    changed. He drank heavily and  often  gambled.   He  subjected  her  to
    sustained mental and physical domestic abuse which continued even after
    their daughter was born in 2014.  He fell into debt which  resulted  in
    men coming to the family home and threatening the Appellant.   In  2016
    the Appellant and daughter were  evicted  from  their  home  after  her
    husband stopped paying the rent. She returned to her  family  home  for
    some months but left the country in 2016 after she became  afraid  that
    her by then estranged husband, or his family, would try  and  take  her
    daughter away from her.

 9. The Tribunal found, in findings that I have preserved, that

              i) The  Appellant's  fears  in  respect  of  her  husband  are
                 subjectively real but are not objectively well-founded;  in
                 particular


             ii) The Appellant's child is not presently  at  risk  of  being
                 abducted or otherwise harmed  by  her  father  or  paternal
                 family; and


            iii) If any risk were to arise the Appellant  and  her  daughter
                 would be sufficiently protected by the Albanian state so as
                 to  obviate  any  need  for  international  protection:  DM
                 (sufficiency  of  protection  -  PSG  -  women  -  domestic
                 violence) Albania CG [2004] UKIAT 00059 applied.


    Matters in Issue


10. The Applicant must demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that she
    meets the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1) (vi) of  the  Immigration
    Rules:


          276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave
         to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
         date of application, the applicant:


          (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or above, has
         lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting
         any period of imprisonment) but there would be very significant
         obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to which
         he would have to go if required to leave the UK.


11. The Applicant seeks to  demonstrate  that  such  obstacles  exist  with
    reference to the following matters:


              i) She is now estranged from her natal family;


             ii) She has serious mental health issues for  which  she  would
                 not receive adequate assistance in Albania;

            iii) She remains extremely fearful of her husband and his family
                 and as such cannot return to her home area;

             iv) There exists in  Albania  serious  societal  discrimination
                 against single mothers/women who live alone.


12. If the Appellant fails to discharge the burden of proof in  respect  of
    paragraph 276ADE(1) she alternatively puts her case  on  the  basis  of
    Article 8 'outside of the Rules'.   Since  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  is
    exclusively concerned with the individual's private life in the country
    to which they are expected to return, any consideration of the  quality
    of the individual's private life here can only take place outwith  that
    framework.   In this regard the Appellant relies on  the  matters  (i)-
    (iv) outlined above, but in addition asks that  significant  weight  be
    given to two matters: the best interests of her daughter, and the  fact
    that in this country she  enjoys  considerable  support  from  friends,
    clinicians and women's groups.


    Paragraph 276ADE(1): Discussion and Findings


13. The primary factual issue that remains to be determined is  whether  or
    not the Appellant is now estranged from her own family, as she claims.


14. The Appellant states that her father  was  a  security  guard  and  her
    mother a tailor. They had worked hard and made sacrifices so  that  she
    could attend university and as a result  they  were  extremely  unhappy
    when she decided to marry her husband in 2009. He was not educated  and
    worked in construction.  The Appellant's mother in  particular  worried
    about the relationship. She told the Appellant that after the  marriage
    he would change; that men in northern Albania expected their  wives  to
    "stay and home and shut up". She was right.

15. The Appellant was expected to  move  in  with  her  in-laws  after  the
    marriage. They were extremely traditional and her father-in-law treated
    her mother-in-law  "like  a  slave".  The  way  he  spoke  to  her  was
    "disgraceful"  and  she  received  no  respect  from  him.  Instead  of
    resisting this, the Appellant's mother-in-law accepted it  as  the  way
    things should be, and resented the Appellant for the fact that she  had
    been permitted to pursue her education.   The Appellant  was  still  at
    university when she got married and  her  in-laws  did  their  best  to
    interfere with her studies. They made it very difficult for her but she
    did manage to complete her degree in  2013.   Shortly  after  this  the
    relationship between the Appellant and her husband,  and  his  parents,
    had grown so bad that they had to leave that house and rent  their  own
    place.  When they did, the relationship deteriorated to the extent that
    the  Appellant  was   regularly   subjected   to   domestic   violence,
    particularly when her husband was drunk, which was often.  He  continue
    to beat her whilst she was pregnant with their daughter.

16. In 2016 the Appellant was evicted from the home  she  shared  with  her
    husband because he had not paid the  rent.  Unable  to  return  to  his
    parents, she had no option but to return to her own parents' house.  In
    her statement she writes:


         "My parents made it clear  I  could  only  return  to  their  house
         because of my daughter. Money  was  difficult  because  my  parents
         earned so little money.  My  parents  had  borrowed  money  for  my
         education so they were paying off debts."


17. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the  Appellant  explained
    that her father, and brother, have become increasingly angry  with  her
    about the situation that she has placed them in. They are concerned not
    just about their own 'standing', but also  the  possibility  that  they
    will encounter difficulties  with  her  in-laws.  Her  father  is  also
    furious with her that she went against his wishes to marry her husband,
    and now expects him to clean up her mess.


18. At the hearing before me the Appellant told me that since  her  arrival
    in the United Kingdom  she  has  spoken  to  her  mother  on  very  few
    occasions.  They have spoken by telephone perhaps 3-4 times.  Last time
    they spoke her mother told her she should stay away. The Appellant does
    not know the full details but  she  knows  that  her  mother  is  under
    pressure from her father and  brother.   Her  brother  is  particularly
    antagonistic.  He  told  his  parents  from  the  beginning  that  they
    shouldn't help the Appellant. Her father now agrees with him  and  says
    that "she should get on with her own life".  There is no way  that  she
    could go back home now. The Appellant also said that she  is  concerned
    that her family have received threats from her  in-laws  and  this  has
    played some part in why her father has turned against her.

19. As Judge Brookfield notes, this was a  family  who  had  supported  the
    Appellant in the past. Although they were unhappy that she  had  chosen
    to marry her husband they had taken her and her daughter in after  they
    were evicted in 2016 and had looked  after  them  for  approximately  6
    months before paying for them to leave Albania.  I have borne  that  in
    mind when I evaluated the evidence that the family are  now  estranged.
    Having considered all of the evidence in the round  however,  including
    the fact that the Appellant has been  found  to  have  given  generally
    credible evidence (in respect of her  origins,  the  domestic  violence
    etc) I am satisfied on balance that  she  is  now  estranged  from  her
    parents and brother as she describes.    She  has  consistently  stated
    that her father is a traditional northern Albanian man who regards  the
    kanun as his personal law.  As such it is not at all  implausible  that
    he would "wash his hands" of the Appellant in the manner she describes.
    The Appellant went against his wishes when she married,  and  connected
    him though marriage to a family of whom he did not  approve;  she  then
    brought him 'shame' by leaving her husband and returning to the  family
    home with a child. He has been left in debt by  his  financing  of  her
    education and latterly her journey to  the  United  Kingdom.  In  those
    circumstances I accept that he is now hostile towards his daughter.


20. That being so I accept that there is no realistic  possibility  of  the
    Appellant and her daughter returning to Shkoder.  Since Mrs Aboni  also
    accepted this to be the case, I can be brief in setting out my  reasons
    why. They are threefold. First, the  Appellant  cannot  return  to  her
    family. Second, the social mores in the north are such that it would be
    extremely difficult, if not unheard of, for a young woman with a  child
    to be living  alone.  Third,  notwithstanding  the  findings  of  Judge
    Brookfield as to objective risk, I (and Judge Brookfield)  accept  that
    the Appellant has a very real subjective fear of  her  former  husband,
    borne of many years of serious domestic violence. The  Appellant's  GP,
    support group MRANG and Dr Ghosh all speak of the  Appellant's  serious
    anxiety and trauma arising from her past experiences and I was able  to
    see for myself at the hearing the extent of her  fear,  since  she  was
    crying and extremely anxious throughout much of the hearing.

21. The question remains whether the Appellant is able to demonstrate  that
    there are very significant obstacles to her integration in Tirana.   In
    her submissions Mrs Aboni referred me  to  the  December  2018  Country
    Policy and  Information  Note  Albania:  Domestic  abuse  and  violence
    against women.  Relying on the evidence  in  that  document  Mrs  Aboni
    submitted that by any measure, the Appellant could not meet the test in
    the Rule.

22. First, because she would have access to housing.   In  the  short  term
    this could be limited to access to a shelter:

         6.1.4 The HO FFT further stated: 'Although women in the more  rural
         and remote areas  of  Albania  may  find  it  difficult  to  access
         services locally, women who relocate to Tirana can obtain help  and
         shelter there. Shelters are provided to house victims  of  domestic
         abuse (both state- and NGO-run) which:  have  sufficient  capacity,
         are professionally run, have  effective  safeguards  against  being
         detected; and a re-integration programme to help women re-establish
         themselves into the community...


    But in the longer term could include state-provided social housing:

         7.4.2 The FCO explored the position of a single  woman,  previously
         the victim of domestic violence, returning to Albania with a child.
         In a letter dated January 2017, they noted, 'During a meeting  with
         the senior official of the Ministry of Social Welfare, the  British
         Embassy was told that  the  municipalities  have  housing  offices,
         where returned citizens who do not have accommodation can  register
         to benefit from the status of a homeless person and subsequently to
         benefit social housing. We therefore conclude that  social  housing
         would be available to the subject.'

    Or alternatively housing in the  private  sector,  paid  for  with  the
    assistance of NGOs/local government:

         7.4.1 The HO FFT reported: 'In some cases, as a  result  of  social
         stigma, victims may be reluctant to return to their home community,
         or may be rejected by their  families.  If  no  family  support  is
         available to the victim when they leave the shelter, D and E assist
         with/subsidise  payment  of  rent  for  their  new   accommodation,
         typically for 6-12 months. The Municipality of Tirana also  assists
         with this (this is the only municipality which does).  This  "Lease
         Bonus Programme" is paid for a year and if the woman's situation is
         still the same after a year the Municipality carries on paying  it,
         but they try to  empower  the  woman  to  become  independent.  The
         Municipality of Tirana said that they don't have a minimum level of
         rent and they have a scoring formula to work out how  much  help  a
         woman needs; 18 VDV had benefited from the Lease Bonus Programme in
         2017 (up to 6 November) with eight in 2016. The Ministry for Health
         and Social Welfare said that the ministry which deals  with  social
         housing deals with the payment of rent bonuses.

23. Second because the Appellant's daughter would have access to education,
    enabling the Appellant to work:


         7.6.1 The HO FFT were told: '[...] there is a  directive  from  the
         Ministry  of  Education  which  requires   that   all   educational
         facilities must accept people back into schools who  have  returned
         from the diaspora abroad - whether a VoT or just as a migrant. 'The
         Ministry of Education said they also support returning migrants  by
         providing special help with teachers or free books to help them get
         back into education. This might include women who  left  school  or
         are older than schooling age  -  but  it  is  also  done  alongside
         working: they can do both half and half.


         'The Ministry of Education told the FFT  that  it  works  with  the
         shelters. "It's  a  full-scale  collaboration.  The  Ministry  gets
         constant requests from the shelters from women who want  to  go  to
         school. The  same  level  of  collaboration  exists  with  the  VoT
         shelters." [...]
         ...
         In a letter dated January 2017, the FCO reported: 'According to the
         Strategy ['On the Reintegration of the Returned Albanian Citizens,'
         introduced in 2010 (the Strategy was meant to be  in  effect  until
         2015, but according to a senior official at the Ministry of  Social
         Welfare it is still the document they used as  guidance)]  and  [a]
         senior official from the Ministry of Social  Welfare,  children  of
         returned Albanian citizens will have priority to be  registered  in
         schools in Albania and extra lessons of Albanian language  will  be
         offered to them. Any previous diploma/qualifications earned  abroad
         will also be recognized.


24. If the Appellant were unable to find work, or  considered  herself  too
    unwell to do so, she would receive financial support:


         7.5.1 The HO FFT were informed of  economic  assistance  available:
         'The Municipality of Tirana offers support to daily  centres  which
         provide lunch for women and their children. A food package for  use
         at  home  can  be  provided  for  women  who  do  not  want  to  be
         identified....


         'The Ministry of Interior told the FFT that the state can and  does
         support women  with  children.  For  example,  there  is  financial
         support to pay for kindergarten; they can also support  paying  for
         food/meals. Although acknowledged as not perfect, the  basic  needs
         are met. A single mother can send a child to nursery for free.


         7.5.2 The FCO explored the position for a single woman,  previously
         the victim of domestic violence, returning to live in Tirana with a
         child. In a letter dated January 2017, the FCO reported: 'According
         to Directive No. 8, dated 23.6.2004  "On  the  calculation  of  the
         social welfare benefit" of  the  Minister  of  Social  Welfare  and
         Youth, to receive social  welfare  benefits  the  returned  citizen
         should apply at the Offices of the Social Services situated  within
         the municipalities. The amount of the social welfare benefit in the
         case  [of  a  single  woman,  previously  the  victim  of  domestic
         violence, with a child would be]:


            . ALL 5,700/ � 36 per month:
            . ALL 1800 the first member of the family
            . ALL 900 for children under 18 years old
            . ALL 3000 for victims of  domestic  violence  (the  status  of
              domestic violence victims is given by a court decision  which
              has reviewed the case and has issued a restraining order).'

                    7.5.3 The FCO conducted an open-source internet  search,
to establish
                    whether a single woman with a child  would  be  able  to
live on this level of
                    benefits. They concluded that, 'Sources [...] vary  with
regard to the
                    proportion of the Albanian  population  believed  to  be
living in poverty -
                    ranging from 14.3%, to almost a  quarter  -  but  it  is
clear that all sources
                    agree the proportion is extremely  high.  Moreover,  the
various sources
                 consulted consistently maintained that a) poverty is  worst
in rural areas
                 and that b) women are disproportionately  affected  by  it.
'We therefore
               must unfortunately conclude that  a  significant  number  of

    Albania.'


25. The next matter in issue is the extent of the Appellant's mental health
    issues, and the extent to which these could be  adequately  treated  in
    Albania. Mrs Aboni relies  on  the  evidence  in  the  CPIN  that  such
    services are widely available,  in  general  and  specifically  in  the
    women's shelters:


         7.3.2 The HO FFT were  also  told  about  mental  health  provision
         within shelters: 'At the meeting with the Directors of the  NRCVHT,
         NRCVDV and the Albanian Social Services the FFT was informed  that,
         as in line with Albanian legislation, every person  who  approaches
         the shelters is subject to a mental health assessment and a  report
         is produced. Depending on  the  level  of  treatment  required  and
         severity, it can be dealt with in either the shelter or the  person
         can be sent to a specific centre. The Director of the NRCVHT  spoke
         of a specific example of a person who has mental health issues, and
         they have been undergoing treatment in the  centre  for  two  years
         now. 'Normally, the shelters are equipped with a psychiatrist.  The
         law provides that every person in a shelter has the  right  to  the
         same level of treatment as any other citizen. The  Head  of  Mental
         Health and Addictology at the Ministry of Health said psycho-social
         support is offered to people who come out of  shelters,  they  will
         get more support than others and there is no time limit on how long
         they are monitored in the community - it depends on the diagnosis.'

26. For the Appellant Ms Widdison accepted (with reservations)  that  there
    may be some practical support for the Appellant if she were to live  in
    Tirana, whether supported by NGOs or the state. She  submitted  however
    that it was important to consider what the point of the rule was. It is
    to protect private life, and in this respect she asked me  to  consider
    the likelihood of the Appellant being able "to operate on a  day-to-day
    basis in that society and to  build  up  within  a  reasonable  time  a
    variety of human relationships to give substance  to  the  individual's
    private or family life": see Kamara v Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department [2016] EWCA Civ 813.  In evaluating this  test  Ms  Widdison
    asked me to bear two important matters in mind.


27. First of all the extensive evidence provided by the Appellant's GP,  by
    'MRANG' (Merseyside Asylum Seekers  and  Refugee  Pre  and  Post  Natal
    Support Group), and by Mersey Care NHS Trust  that  the  Appellant  has
    consistently been receiving treatment for anxiety and depression  since
    January 2017. These treatments have included talking therapies, CBT and
    medication: she continues to be prescribed 45mg per day  of  mirtazpine
    (this being the maximum  recommended  daily  dose).  This  evidence  is
    consistent with the views expressed by Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist
    Dr Chandra Ghosh who makes a diagnosis of PTSD.   I  am  asked  to  pay
    particular attention not just to the diagnosis, but to  what  Dr  Ghosh
    finds in respect of the Appellant's abilities  to  'integrate',  ie  to
    form relationships with others in the sense understood in Kamara:

         "In the case of [the  Appellant],  she  has  been  threatened  with
         violence  within  her  relationship,  which  has  resulted  in  her
         developing fear and feelings of helplessness and horror.  In  terms
         of characteristic symptoms, she suffers from psychological distress
         when she is exposed to stimuli and remind her of her violence....


         The individual tends to avoid  stimuli  which  is  associated  with
         trauma and  also  makes  deliberate  attempts  to  avoid  thoughts,
         feelings or conversations that are associated with trauma.  This is
         a particular feature of individuals  who  have  been  subjected  to
         domestic violence, such as [the Appellant].  She  also  avoids  any
         reminders of important aspects of the traumatic  event.   She  does
         find it very difficult to socialise and feels  quite  detached  and
         estranged from other people.  She said that this has been a feature
         for her throughout her childhood and adult life, and she  finds  it
         extremely  difficult  to  express  emotions  and  feelings.    This
         inability to express feelings and emotions is led to difficulty  in
         her trying to form relationships....


         She finds it difficult  to  fall  asleep  and  is  currently  being
         treated with medication by her general practitioner.   She  suffers
         from  very  severe  nightmares,   and   she   also   suffers   from
         hypervigilance  and  exaggerated  startle  response.   Like   other
         individuals who have been subjected to domestic violence,  she  has
         other associated symptoms, which include  a  sense  of  fearfulness
         horror and a loss of self-esteem.  The individual also  feels  that
         they cannot engage with other people and there tend  to  be  social
         withdrawal. There are associated symptoms of self-harm and suicidal
         attempts because of the loss of sense of self. "

28. Dr Ghosh identifies inter alia that  the  Appellant  suffers  from  the
    following diagnostic criteria: psychological distress when  exposed  to
    stimuli that remind her of  the  violence  that  she  has  experienced,
    nightmares and flashbacks, anxiety, stress and heightened  arousal.  As
    set out above, other symptoms consistent with the diagnosis include the
    Appellant finding it difficult to relate to  others,  feeling  detached
    and estranged from people around her.  Dr Ghosh describes the Appellant
    as "extremely fragile". Survivors of domestic violence fall into a sub-
    category of PTSD which manifests itself  as  ongoing  "terror"  of  the
    violence being repeated: in the Appellant's case this is centred on her
    fears that her daughter will be snatched from her.   Dr Ghosh concludes
    that if returned to the scene of the harm (Albania) there is a "serious
    risk of her mental state deteriorating and  therefore  her  health  and
    safety will be put at risk. It  would  also  endanger  the  health  and
    safety of her daughter".


29. The second matter relied upon by Ms Widdison  was  in  respect  of  the
    social consequences to be faced by single mothers in Albanian  society.
    Whilst it may be the case that  provisions  such  as  shelters  etc  do
    exist, in the medium to long term women living on their own continue to
    face significant discrimination and  "negative  attitudes"  from  those
    around them. Ms Widdison placed reliance on the country  guidance  case
    of TD & AD (trafficked women) CG [2016] UKUT 92 (IAC) [at 51]:


         "A further problem lies in the isolation of the VOT once she leaves
         the shelter.  The family remains of central importance in  Albanian
         society and women such as VOTs or victims of domestic violence  who
         live alone stand out. Being a single woman is always a factor  that
         attracts  unwanted  attention.   For  instance  harassment  in  the
         workplace is something which occurs, but is less likely  to  happen
         to women who have the protection of a family around them.  Although
         there is no data or recent research on  the  situation  for  single
         women  who  return  to  Albania  and  live  alone,   in   Professor
         Haxhiymeri's experience they  are  "in  most  cases  considered  as
         abandoned from their families because they  are  'kurva'  (whores).
         This label carries a  lot  of  hate,  discrimination  and  risk  of
         exclusion. They are not  welcomed  in  social  groups.   Even  when
         employed, people try to stay away from  them.    Employers  try  to
         exploit them by making them work long hours, harder  and  pay  them
         less." Professor Haxhyimeri observes that such individuals  do  not
         make a lot of money but sometimes "it is enough to survive".

30. Ms Widdison further asked that  I  consider  the  evidence  as  to  the
    practical support available in light of these twin  vulnerabilities  of
    the Appellant.  There are limited spaces in  the  shelters,  and  where
    medical assistance, including psychological support, is offered  it  is
    of extremely limited quality (see TD & AD at �101):

         Taking all of the evidence in the round we are satisfied that there
         is a basic level of healthcare provided in the shelters,  but  that
         there must remain concerns about the  quality  and  extent  of  it,
         particularly in relation  to  mental  health  treatment.    On  the
         evidence before us, such care is limited  to  the  prescription  of
         anti-depressants and where available, counselling by shelter  staff
         who have no formal training in psychiatry or psychology.


    Furthermore, the Appellant faces considerable  obstacles  in  obtaining
    paid employment. She has a young child to care for, has her own  mental
    health issues and has little to no work experience.

31. I remind myself that paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) is  concerned  exclusively
    with the conditions in the country to which the applicant is notionally
    to  be  returned.  It  does  not  involve  a  comparison  between   the
    Appellant's life here, and what her life might be there.  The  test  is
    simply whether the Appellant will be able to establish a  private  life
    for herself in that country.


32. It is apparent from the information  contained  in  the  December  2018
    Country  Policy  and  Information  Note  Albania:  Domestic  abuse  and
    violence against women that there are in place for victims of  domestic
    violence a number of safeguards in Tirana.      The  Home  Office  Fact
    Finding team who visited the country in 2017 found there to be a number
    of shelters in the city, which had sufficient capacity  to  meet  need.
    Beyond the shelters the finding of the FCO  is  that  there  is  social
    housing available, and it is  reported  that  there  are  a  number  of
    schemes to assist women with paying the rent. The  NGO  'Different  but
    Equal' can subsidise rental payments for typically between 6-12 months,
    and the Municipality  of  Tirana  has  a  specific  program  which  had
    assisted 18 victims of domestic violence during 2017.  I have no reason
    to doubt the evidence in  the  CPIN  indicating  that  the  Appellant's
    daughter would have access to education or before  she  starts  primary
    school, a nursery place.   I am therefore satisfied that the  Appellant
    would be able to access housing and education for her daughter.


33. I am however unable to be satisfied as to the level of support that the
    Appellant might  receive  from  the  state  should  she  fail  to  find
    employment. The figures cited in the CPIN in respect of the Ministry of
    the Interior social welfare benefit do not all appear to  be  available
    to the Appellant. Although it appears that she would receive  ALL  1800
    for herself, and a further ALL 900 for her daughter, according  to  the
    FCO research she will not receive the additional ALL 3000  for  victims
    of domestic violence, since her case has not been reviewed by  a  court
    and a restraining order  issued.  At  the  date  of  writing  the  bare
    benefits mentioned equate to approximately �18 per month[1].  Whilst  I
    appreciate that a lot of people in Albania live in  poverty,  and  that
    many do so on an income of ALL 5700 or less, I remain to  be  satisfied
    that �18 per month could meet the Appellant's "basic needs". Unless she
    is able to work I consider it very likely that  she  and  her  daughter
    will become dependent upon charity handouts such as  the  food  parcels
    mentioned in the CPIN.

34. I do not consider it likely that the Appellant is going to be  able  to
    work, at least not in the foreseeable future.  Whilst there clearly are
    some opportunities provided by the NGOs and state shelters mentioned in
    the CPIN it is apparent from the medical evidence that her mental state
    is extremely "fragile" and that she finds it  difficult  to  cope  with
    daily life.    In those circumstances it is very unlikely that she will
    be able to obtain, and sustain, employment.

35. I am therefore satisfied that the Appellant and her  daughter  will  be
    accommodated by the state. I am satisfied that the little girl will  be
    able to go to school. If she is feels able to, the Appellant can obtain
    support from the various women's groups mentioned in  the  CPIN.   This
    includes some degree of mental health treatment which is  available  in
    shelters and in other settings. All of these factors point towards  her
    being able to return to Tirana.   I  remain  however  deeply  concerned
    that the Appellant does not at present have the  mental  resilience  to
    avail herself of the opportunities that are, on the evidence, available
    to other similarly situated  women.    Her  ability  to  negotiate  the
    social welfare system, and to get access to the services mentioned,  is
    at present severely compromised by  her  own  mental  ill-health.   The
    practical assistance that is available must  be  measured  against  the
    cumulative challenges she faces: a powerful  and  pervasive  subjective
    fear of further violence; the social stigma  and  isolation  of  single
    parenthood; the lack of family support, and what Dr Ghosh describes  as
    her extremely fragile mental state.  The reality is that I  cannot  see
    any prospect of the Appellant establishing a  meaningful  private  life
    for herself in Tirana.   She may be able to secure a roof over her head
    but her ability to integrate and build relationships with others is, at
    present, fundamentally undermined by the legacy of the serious violence
    to which she has been subjected.  I am wholly satisfied that she  would
    live a life of extreme isolation and fear should  she  be  returned  to
    Albania.


36. Accordingly I must find that the Appellant would face very  significant
    obstacles to her integration in Albania today.

37. That being my finding I need not deal with Article 8  'outside  of  the
    rules' but I do so only to  mark  my  obligations  under  s.55  of  the
    Borders  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act   2009,   since   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) appears to focus exclusively on the individual - that  is
    to say adult - applicant.   It is perhaps obvious from  my  conclusions
    above but I find that it would be wholly contrary to the best interests
    of the Appellant's child if she were to be removed to Albania with  her
    mother.   Her basic physical needs may be met but she would be left  in
    the very difficult position of living alone with her mother  -  already
    fragile but likely to be  increasingly  distressed.  That  would  be  a
    bewildering and frightening turn of events for a child who  is  settled
    and prospering in the United Kingdom, where her mother  has  a  support
    network to whom she can turn.  I find  that  it  would  likely  have  a
    profoundly damaging impact upon her. I cannot think that this would  be
    an acceptable or proportionate consequence  of  the  need  to  maintain
    immigration control.

    Decision and Directions


38. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains  errors  of  law  such
    that the decision is set aside to the extent identified above.


39. I remake the decision by allowing the appeal on human rights grounds.


40. There is an order for anonymity.
