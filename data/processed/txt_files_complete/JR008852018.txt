                       Immigration and Asylum Chamber

                          Judicial Review Decision



                       The Queen on the application of
                                     SM
                   (a minor, by her litigation friend AM)
                                                                   Applicant

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                      Before Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce

            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having  considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having   heard   from   the
Applicant's representative,  Ms  A.  Weston  QC  of  Counsel  instructed  by
Central England Law Centre, and the Respondent's representative Mr Z.  Malik
of Counsel instructed by the Government Legal Department, at  a  hearing  at
Birmingham Civil Justice Centre on the 20th February 2019


          Decision: the application for judicial review is granted.


      Background and the Decision of the Secretary of State

   1. This claim concerns the decision of the Secretary of State  to  refuse
      to grant the Applicant (SM) indefinite leave to remain.  SM  is  today
      16 years old. At the date of the decision she was 15.


   2. The facts are not in issue.


   3. SM was born in Pakistan in December 2002. She  lived  there  with  her
      mother (AM) and father until in 2005 the family came to  live  in  the
      United Kingdom. AM had leave to enter as a Tier  4  (General)  Student
      Migrant; SM and her father were Tier 4 dependents.  Approximately  one
      year after their arrival the relationship between AM and  SM's  father
      started to break down.  In her witness statement SM recalls seeing her
      father behave violently in the home and has a "horrible memory" of him
      locking her in a room.   This  early  exposure  to  domestic  violence
      perpetrated by her father  was  the  first  in  a  line  of  traumatic
      experiences for SM.


   4. SM's parents divorced, and a bitter  and  acrimonious  custody  battle
      ensued.  By an order sealed  on  the  30th  January  2012  the  Family
      Division of the High Court ordered  that  SM  was  to  live  with  her
      mother, and not be removed from the jurisdiction without  the  written
      consent of her father or leave of the court.  Being at the  centre  of
      this custody dispute was the second challenging life  event  faced  by
      SM.


   5. After the divorce SM and AM lived together in a  string  of  different
      places. In her witness statement AM describes being at her "wits  end"
      during this period.  She still had Tier 4 status  at  that  time,  and
      unable to work or claim benefits she had been reliant on  intermittent
      support from her family in Pakistan. She had, in her own words,  ended
      up in exploitative relationships with  men  as  a  means  to  securing
      financial support for  herself  and  her  daughter.  Today  she  feels
      "humiliated and ashamed" of the fact that SM witnessed some  of  these
      men being abusive towards her.   SM herself describes  this  difficult
      period in her life as follows:


         "my mother and I have had issues regarding our  immigration  status
         since my early childhood which meant it was never the same  for  me
         as any other ordinary kid's life. My mother wasn't allowed to  work
         which meant I faced a rough childhood with a lot  of  moving  about
         into different houses in different cities and joining  new  schools
         so it was hard for her to make ends meet and hard for  me  to  cope
         with the constant change.


         At an age where most little girls would worry about toys and  dolls
         I would worry about whether I would have a place to spend the night
         or even see my mother because of  the  court  case  my  father  had
         filed...."


      This period of poverty, instability and further domestic violence  was
      the third difficulty that SM faced growing up.


   6. In 2013, when SM was 11, her mother remarried.  AM's second husband is
      British and is the father of SM's two younger brothers, who were  born
      in 2014 and 2015.   AM explains that when she met her  second  husband
      the relationship was at first a good one,  but  as  time  went  on  it
      became clearer and clearer that he resented SM. He would for  instance
      provide things for his sons but not SM. He would emotionally abuse  SM
      and her mother by referring to their lack of  immigration  status;  SM
      also witnessed  AM  being  physically  assaulted  by  him.   Her  poor
      relationship with her step-father, and his abusive  behaviour  towards
      her and her mother, was SM's fourth ordeal.


   7. Shortly after her mother married this man SM started secondary school.
      SM states that she has persistently been the  victim  of  bullying  at
      school which would take place both  online  and  in  person.  This  is
      confirmed by her school who consider  that  she  has  been  vulnerable
      since she started there.  In a 2017 'Child in Need' referral from  her
      school to Birmingham City Council, SM's headteacher states  that  from
      year 7 on SM has been the victim of teasing and name calling  by  boys
      in her class and that SM was "unable to cope" with this.  Although the
      school took action, moving both SM and the boys involved, it persisted
      and "spread quite widely", to  include  "several  incidents  involving
      nasty posts online".  In her statement SM explains that at least  some
      of this bullying has centred on her immigration status:


         "Lots of the friends I had as I was younger or now don't know about
         my immigration situation.  They all think I am  a  British  citizen
         just like them but  I  find  it  is  an  embarrassment  because  no
         teenager would understand why or how I still haven't  qualified  to
         become a British citizen when I have lived  in  the  country  since
         reception to now when  I'm  going  into  my  GCSEs.  My  precarious
         immigration status is a source of shame to me and I  just  find  it
         really difficult to disclose my circumstances, even to  my  closest
         friends.  My fear is that they will just think I  am  "a  freshie".
         In fact, I recently fell out with one of my best friends who I have
         told about my status because that information was passed on to some
         boys in my class.  They bullied me  about  my  status  and  I  have
         received some nasty social media posts as a result of it.   I  felt
         humiliated because of the nasty things they were saying to me  that
         were linked to my immigration status".


      This persistent bullying, much of it linked to her immigration status,
      is the fifth source of distress for SM.


   8. SM has been back to Pakistan on two occasions since she  arrived  here
      in 2005.   In November 2015 she returned because her  grandmother  had
      died.  In February 2017 SM and AM were required to return to  Pakistan
      in order to attend a court hearing, after  her  father  started  fresh
      custody proceedings in the courts there.  On the first of these visits
      SM was aged just 13; on the second she was 14�.  Despite her young age
      during both of these trips, SM came under pressure from  her  paternal
      family to enter into an arranged marriage.  Her father and his  family
      repeatedly told her that she would be married to a cousin in Pakistan.
       In her statement SM describes in detail the stress that  this  placed
      her under:


         "Whilst I was in Pakistan my Dad was telling me that he  wanted  me
         to live with him in Pakistan, and that he wanted to make  me  marry
         one of his first cousins.  I was really sad and upset when I  heard
         him say this and it made me feel anxious and scared all over again.
          The last thing I want to do is  to  be  forced  into  marriage  to
         someone that I don't know but also it would mean I  would  have  to
         live in Pakistan and not in the UK.  I really hate  my  father  for
         doing this to me and making travel to Pakistan to go to court.  And
         I hate him for wanting to force me to marry someone".


      The threat of forced marriage is the sixth challenge that SM  has  had
      to deal with.


   9. It is against this background that SM's  school,  doctors  and  social
      services have repeatedly expressed concerns about her  mental  health.
      Her school, in its 'Child in Need' referral,  report  that  they  have
      been dealing with SM's self-harming since  2015.   On  more  than  one
      occasion she has been found to be in possession of a blade  whilst  at
      school.  She has been found to have made multiple cuts  to  her  body,
      primarily on her face and arms.  The school nurse  and  teachers  have
      all tried to support SM through this.  The school has in the past made
      a referral to a professional counselling service, and in  the  request
      to Birmingham City Council Children's Services they express  the  view
      that SM's mental health is "deteriorating".  Of  her  self-harming  SM
      says this:


         "... I felt I had to try and be really  mature  or  try  to  handle
         situations and events  other  kids  my  age  wouldn't  have  to  go
         through.  This really affected me emotionally and I started to self-
         harm as a coping strategy.  The self-harming is  the  time  when  I
         feel I am in control of what I'm doing.  It is the only time that I
         feel that I'm in control.  I know that it is wrong and I know  that
         it upsets my mum but it is something that I know I can do  to  give
         me a release and make me feel that I  am  the  one  who  is  making
         decisions.  I have never been able to make  decisions  and  I  have
         always had to watch other people  make  decisions  for  me  and  my
         mum, including the court and the Home Office and my dad  and  other
         members of the family and the community".


  10. SM goes on to give an example of how insecurity can lead her to  self-
      harm.  Due to an administrative error at the Home Office her biometric
      residence card was sent to the wrong address. SM explains:


         "I was told that I had been granted limited leave to remain  but  I
         did not have the card to prove it and that just made me feel  angry
         sad and upset. I self-harmed as a result of this. It seems  that  I
         am just left constantly anxious about the  future  because  I  just
         don't have any certainty".


  11. This was the factual matrix presented to the Home Office when, on  the
      26th June  2017,  a  Birmingham  based  charity  'Asylum  Support  and
      Immigration Resource Team' (ASIRT) made an application  on  behalf  of
      mother and daughter. At that stage both AM and  SM  had  Discretionary
      Leave to Remain, but that leave was due to expire. ASIRT wrote in  the
      following terms:


         "Please find enclosed applications for further leave to  remain  in
         respect  of  [AM],  submitted  on  the  basis   of   her   parental
         relationship to her to British citizen children [SM's  two  younger
         brothers].  As you will note [AM] is now sole carer for [her sons],
         her relationship with the father having broken down due to domestic
         abuse. [AM] and her children  are  now  assessed  as  destitute  by
         Birmingham City Council's Children and  Families  Directorate,  and
         are provided with subsistence support  and  accommodation  -  at  a
         domestic violence refuge - by that authority under  section  17  of
         the Children Act.  We  therefore  submit  [AM]'s  leave  to  remain
         request in the expectation that a  fee  waiver  is  applicable  and
         enclosed supporting financial  information  in  the  form  of  bank
         statements confirming that [AM]'s bank statements are presently  in
         excess of �900 overdrawn.


         We further draw your  attention  to  the  fact  that  [AM]'s  older
         daughter [SM], also a Pakistani  national,  is  included  as  [AM]s
         dependent on this application.  As you will note [SM] has  been  in
         the UK since the age of three and has therefore spent 12 of the  15
         years of her life to date in this country.  She therefore meets the
         requirements of paragraph 276ADE of the  immigration  rules  having
         been resident in the UK and integrated into the school's  education
         system for well over seven years.


         That being the case, we would draw your attention to  the  attached
         evidence of [SM]'s mental instability and her history of  self-harm
         and low self-esteem. As you will note her GP has  recommended  that
         her mental instability is of  such  severity  that  she  should  be
         granted the right of leave to remain on a permanent basis.


         While we are aware that general Home Office custom and practice  in
         such instances is to grant leave to remain in 30 months blocs until
         granting settlement at 10 years, we respectfully submit  that  such
         action is not appropriate in this instance,  due  to  the  family's
         destitute circumstances,  the  history  of  domestic  violence  and
         abuse, the  concerns  around  potential  forced  marriage  and  the
         concerns around [SM]'s poor mental health.   We  are  therefore  in
         this case requesting that the Secretary of  State's  discretion  is
         used to grant her indefinite leave to remain.


         With this in mind we respectfully refer you to the determination SM
         and TM and JD and others v Secretary of  State,  [2013]  EWHC  1144
         (Admin), which  found  that  the  welfare  and  best  interests  of
         relevant children must be considered before determining the  length
         of leave to remain to be granted and that the  blanket  application
         of a fixed limited period of leave to remain is unlawful.   As  the
         judgement noted:


         'When making decisions concerning children.  Officials  must  grasp
         the nettle at the outset and make a realistic appraisal whether  it
         is clear from the outset that a child's future is going  to  be  in
         the UK and make decisions accordingly'


         Given that [SM] has been in the UK for 12 of the 15  years  of  her
         life to date  and  that  she  has  two  siblings  who  are  British
         citizens, it is evident that her life is here in the  UK  and  that
         her future is here in the UK.


         We therefore consider it contrary to her best interests to  prolong
         the instability and precariousness which has characterised her life
         to date and consider it reasonable to request that the Secretary of
         State's discretion is used in this instance to grant her indefinite
         leave to remain, relieving  her  of  the  anxiety  and  uncertainty
         associated with time-limited leave to remain and allowing  her  the
         opportunity to meet her full potential as a schoolchild and to plan
         for access to further and higher education."


  12. That letter covered the  completed  application  forms  (FLR),  and  a
      bundle of evidence which included:


               . A Prohibited Steps, Contact, Specific Issue  and  Residence
                 Order, issued under section 8 of the Children Act  1989  by
                 the Family Division of the High Court sitting at Birmingham
                 District Registry on 30 January 2012


               . Various documents relating to SM's mental health, including
                 a 'Child in Need' referral from her  school  to  Birmingham
                 City Council (which  identifies  SM's  legal  status  as  a
                 "complicating  factor")  and  the  'Child  in  Need'   plan
                 produced by the council's Children's Services


               . A letter dated 8th June 2017 to the UKBA  from  the  Deputy
                 Headteacher  of  SM's  school,  who  describes  her  as   a
                 "vulnerable child on several levels".  The letter expresses
                 concern  about  consistent  self-harming,   bullying,   the
                 effects of the "nasty custody  battle",  poor  housing  and
                 stress. The deputy headteacher concludes:


                   "[SM]'s mental health is deteriorating  because  of  the
                   serious issues facing the family.  I would fully support
                   any application for her to remain in the UK where  I  am
                   sure she has better life chances and will be safe.  [SM]
                   is a very able student academically.   She  came  up  to
                   secondary  school  with  high   SATs   levels   and   is
                   characterised as 'more  able'.   She  has  potential  to
                   achieve high grades and to go to university if her  life
                   settles down and the worry hanging over  her  about  her
                   future is removed".


               . A letter dated 14th June 2017  from  the  family  GP.  This
                 records that SM is known to suffer from low mood and stress
                 disorder. She has had to visit the surgery after  incidents
                 of self-harm. The GP had referred  her  for  mental  health
                 support from CAMHS.  The  doctor  concludes:  "due  to  her
                 unstable mental  health  I  feel  she  would  benefit  from
                 residing in the UK on a permanent basis  with  her  mother,
                 who she is settled with"


               . A letter dated 24th January 2018 from  Valerie  Gardner,  a
                 Victim Caseworker with Victim Support. Ms Gardner explained
                 that she has been supporting SM in relation to incidents of
                 bullying and harassment, incidents that have  been  serious
                 enough to warrant police involvement.  She writes:


                       "[SM] has recently been granted a visa for  2�  years
                       and although she is very grateful for  that,  she  is
                       still in a stressful and anxious state because of the
                       uncertainty about her  future  after  that  time  has
                       passed....based  on  my  work  with  [SM],   I   have
                       witnessed how very vulnerable and emotional  she  is.
                       If she is allowed to stay in the United Kingdom on  a
                       permanent basis, she can continue to receive the much
                       needed emotional help and care from  her  mother  and
                       the  other  agencies  that  are  supporting  her   at
                       present".


  13. The Respondent's decision is dated the  6th  November  2017.  It  says
      nothing about the foregoing submissions; it does not  acknowledge  any
      of the evidence; nor does it make any reference to  SM's  request  for
      settlement. It simply states that AM and SM are being granted a period
      of 30 months limited leave to remain, and will be  eligible  to  apply
      for settlement after completing at least 10 years under this route.


  14. By way of letter dated the 5th January 2018 Central England Law Centre
      notified the Respondent that SM (by her litigation friend  her  mother
      AM) wished to challenge  the  failure  to  consider  her  request  for
      indefinite leave. I need not set out the detail of this letter  before
      action, save to say that it complained that none of the  evidence,  or
      submissions, summarised above had been addressed by  the  Respondent's
      letter of 6th November 2017.


  15. On the 14th April 2018 the Respondent  replied,  explaining  that  the
      decision had been reconsidered, and enclosing a new  decision  letter.
      The letter  begins  by  setting  out  why  both  mother  and  daughter
      qualified for limited  leave  to  remain  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
      Immigration Rules. AM had qualified for leave as  a  'parent'  because
      she has sole responsibility for her two British sons.   SM, as a child
      in AM's care, qualified as a child of a parent with limited  leave  to
      remain.   The letter then acknowledges that SM has made a request  for
      indefinite leave to remain to be granted, and  sets  out,  over  seven
      bullet points, the reasons why. Ms Weston QC accepts that these bullet
      points are a fair summary of the case put on behalf of SM.


  16. The letter then sets out the applicable policy on 'longer  periods  of
      leave'. It was to be found in the guidance document 'Family Migration:
      Appendix FM Section 1.0b. Family Life (as a  partner  or  parent)  and
      Private Life: 10 year routes' (August 2015):


         "Settlement in the UK is a privilege, not an automatic entitlement.
         Unless there are truly exceptional reasons, the expectation is that
         applicants should serve a  probationary  period  of  limited  leave
         before being eligible to  apply  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain
         (ILR).


         However, there may be rare cases in which either a longer period of
         leave or an early grant of ILR is  considered  appropriate,  either
         because it is clearly in the best interests of  a  child  (and  any
         countervailing factors do not outweigh  these  best  interests)  or
         because there are  other  particularly  exceptional  or  compelling
         reasons to grant leave for a longer period (or ILR).


         If the applicant specifically requests a  longer  period  of  leave
         than 30 months, or ILR, and provides reasons as to why they think a
         longer period of leave or ILR is appropriate  in  their  case,  the
         decision maker must consider this  and  set  out  in  any  decision
         letter why a grant of more than 30 months or ILR has not been made.


         In cases not involving children (as the main applicant or as family
         members included in the  application),  there  must  be  sufficient
         evidence to demonstrate the individual circumstances are  not  just
         unusual but can be distinguished to a high degree from other  cases
         the extent that it is necessary to deviate from the standard  grant
         of 30 months leave to remain.


         In all cases the onus is on the applicant to provide evidence as to
         why they believe  that  a  longer  period  of  leave  (or  ILR)  is
         necessary and justified on the basis of particularly exceptional or
         compelling reasons.  Where  the  decision-maker  considers  that  a
         longer period of leave may be justified the case must  be  referred
         to a senior caseworker to consider further. If the  decision  maker
         decides  that  the  case  is  not   sufficiently   exceptional   or
         compelling, they should grant  30  months'  leave  to  remain,  and
         explain in the decision letter why this has been granted instead of
         the length of leave requested.


         ...


         In cases involving children (as the main  applicant  or  as  family
         members included in the application), the decision-maker must  also
         have regard to the  best  interests  of  the  child  as  a  primary
         consideration (but not the only  or  the  paramount  consideration)
         when deciding the period of leave to be granted.


         In some cases it may be appropriate to grant leave on a  short-term
         temporary basis to enable particular issues relating to the child's
         welfare to be addressed before they leave the UK.  If the grant  of
         leave is being made on a  short-term  temporary  basis,  a  shorter
         period of leave should be granted appropriate to the  circumstances
         of the case.


         Otherwise, whilst the expectation is that a period  of  30  months'
         (2.5 years') leave will normally be granted,  there  may  be  cases
         where evidence is provided, demonstrating that a child  requires  a
         longer period of limited leave (or ILR), in order  to  reflect  the
         best interests of that individual child.


         There is discretion to  grant  a  longer  period  of  leave,  where
         appropriate, there may be cases where a longer period of  leave  to
         remain is considered appropriate, either because it is  clearly  in
         the best interests of the child (and any countervailing factors  do
         not  outweigh  those  best  interests)   or   because   there   are
         particularly exceptional or compelling  reasons  to  grant  limited
         leave for a longer period, or to grant ILR.


         The onus is on the applicant to establish  that  the  child's  best
         interests would not be met by a grant of 30 months leave to  remain
         and that there are compelling  reasons  that  require  a  different
         period of leave to be granted.  This means that the decision-makers
         should only consider whether to grant a longer period of  leave  or
         ILR if (a) the applicant has specifically asked for  this  and  (b)
         they have provided their reasons for why they think a longer period
         of leave or ILR is appropriate.


         In considering the period of leave to be granted  factors  such  as
         the length of residence in the UK, whether the child  was  born  in
         the UK, and strong evidence to suggest that the child's life  would
         be adversely affected by a grant of limited leave rather  than  ILR
         are relevant.  The conduct of  the  child's  parent(s)  or  primary
         carer and the  immigration  history  and  the  public  interest  in
         maintaining fair, consistent and coherent immigration controls  are
         also relevant when considering the length of leave to be granted.


         Where the parent(s) or primary carer already  has  leave  or  where
         their application is being  decided  first,  the  period  of  leave
         granted  to  the  parent  or  primary  carer  is  relevant  to  the
         assessment of what period of leave to grant the child.   Whilst  it
         will usually be in the child's best interests to have leave in line
         with their parent(s) or primary carer, the  decision-makers  should
         take into account any particularly  compelling  factors  which  may
         warrant a longer period of leave.  It should be borne in mind  that
         the child is not responsible for the conduct or immigration history
         of their parent(s) or primary carer.


         An example of a case where it might be appropriate to grant a child
         ILR early might be where  the  child  has  a  serious  and  chronic
         medical condition which could not be  effectively  treated  in  the
         country of proposed  return  such  that  return  would  breach  the
         child's rights under ECHR Article 3 or Article 8.  The child  would
         be eligible for leave to remain.  However, if  there  was  evidence
         that the child was seriously distressed by the prospect of a  grant
         of limited leave it might be concluded that  it  would  be  in  the
         child's best interest to grant the child ILR to provide  a  greater
         degree of certainty for the purposes of their  continued  treatment
         or mental well-being.  However, the threshold is high, and concerns
         the direct effect on the person concerned. The age of the person is
         only one factor in the assessment.


         ....


         Where a decision is taken to grant ILR to a  child  because  it  is
         considered to be in their best interests, this does not necessarily
         mean that the parent(s) or primary carer should be granted  ILR  in
         line.  It will normally be appropriate to grant a period of limited
         leave to 30 months to the parent(s) or primary carer,  unless  they
         can demonstrate  exceptional  and  compassionate  circumstances  in
         their own right, that warrant departure from this policy.


         In  all  cases,  the  onus  is   on   the   applicant   (or   their
         representative) to provide evidence as to why it  is  in  the  best
         interest of the child to be granted a period of leave  outside  the
         rules that is longer than  30  months.   Where  the  decision-maker
         considers that there are exceptional circumstances that mean it  is
         in the best interests of the child to depart  from  the  policy  of
         granting 30 months leave to remain the case must be referred  to  a
         senior caseworker to consider further.


         Where granting a  non-standard  period  of  limited  leave  to  the
         applicant because it is accepted that there are exceptional reasons
         for doing so, this leave  will  have  to  be  granted  outside  the
         immigration rules as there is no provision within Appendix  FM  for
         granting limited leave for a period of more than 30  months.   This
         also applies to ILR where this is granted outside of  a  valid  ILR
         application or where the requirements of the rules are not met.  If
         there are exceptional reasons to grant ILR.  This should be granted
         outside the rules."


  17. Having set out that policy the decision-maker  then  turns  to  assess
      SM's case.  I set the reasoning out in greater detail  below  but  its
      suffices to note here  that  the  decision-maker  takes  a  series  of
      factors in turn - the family's  destitution,  domestic  violence,  the
      threat of forced marriage, SM's long residence in the United  Kingdom,
      her education, her mental health issues and  the  bullying  -  and  in
      respect of each finds that  it  is  "not  a  circumstance  exceptional
      enough" to  warrant  a  grant  of  ILR.   The  letter  concludes  that
      settlement in the United Kingdom is  a  privilege,  not  an  automatic
      entitlement:


         "Unless there are truly exceptional  reasons,  the  expectation  is
         that applicants should serve a probationary period of leave  before
         being eligible to apply for ILR....
         ...The Secretary of State considers that  it  would  be  unfair  to
         other  migrants  (including  children)  who  have  to  complete   a
         probationary period before being eligible for ILR  for  you  to  be
         given preferential treatment, especially as no application for  ILR
         was made. It is open to you to make an application  for  settlement
         should   you   consider   your   circumstances   are   particularly
         exceptional, compassionate or compelling".


      The request is finally refused on the grounds that it is for a purpose
      not covered by the rules.




      The Challenge


  18. The Applicant  contends  that  the  decision  of  the  Respondent  was
      unlawful for the following reasons:


              i) A failure to take relevant matters into account;


             ii) The Respondent unlawfully fettering her  discretion  and/or
                 failing to exercise such a discretion;


            iii) A failure to discharge the statutory duty under s.55 of the
                 Borders Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009;


             iv) Irrationality;


              v) Failure to apply and/or misinterpreting relevant  published
                 guidance


  19. Ms Weston submitted that  the  first  decision,  that  dated  the  6th
      November 2017, was  demonstrably  flawed  for  all  of  the  foregoing
      reasons. Contrary  to  the  Secretary  of  State's  stated  policy  it
      entirely failed to engage with the explicit request made by ASIRT;  it
      did not contain any consideration of the issues raised; the  decision-
      maker plainly failed to exercise his discretion and the  decision  was
      reached without reference to SM's best interests.


  20. The second decision, that dated the 14th April 2018, was  only  issued
      after the Applicant notified the Respondent of her intention  to  take
      these proceedings. Although it went some way to considering the issues
      raised by ASIRT, it is submitted that its  contents  still  failed  to
      meet the minimum standard of adequacy required in  public  law.  There
      were numerous errors in the approach taken by the Respondent, but  the
      headline criticism is that the letter failed to engage with  the  duty
      to consider SM's best interests; having failed to make any findings on
      where those best interests might lie  it  was  not  possible  for  the
      decision maker to have given lawful effect to  the  published  policy.
      Ms Weston suggested that this failing is a "very real  and  continuing
      problem" in the Secretary  of  State's  approach  to  cases  involving
      children, notwithstanding  clear  guidance  repeatedly  given  by  the
      higher courts.


  21. In their covering letter ASIRT had placed reliance on the decision  of
      Holman J in SM and Others [2014] EWHC 1144 (Admin).  Ms Weston accepts
      that the Court was there concerned with a  differently  worded  policy
      but submits that the judgment nevertheless remains relevant:


         "As Holman J pointed  out  in  SM  &  Others  supra,  there  is  an
         irreconcilable  conflict  between  the  duty  to  treat  the   best
         interests of the child as a 'primary consideration' ie only  to  be
         outweighed  by  an  imperative  of  sufficient  gravity,  and   the
         imposition  of  a  'very  high',  'compelling'   or   'exceptional'
         circumstances threshold. Were the  policy  to  be  interpreted,  as
         here, as effectively imposing an unachievably  high  threshold  for
         children's cases to meet, it would be  unlawful  as  inadequate  to
         meet the s.55 duty: MM  (Lebanon),  particularly  in  circumstances
         where the Respondent expressly relies on the  residual  discretion,
         interpreted in accordance with the s.55 statutory guidance, to meet
         that duty"[1].


  22. The proper approach to determining where a child's best interests  lie
      is set out by Baroness Hale in ZH (Tanzania) at paragraphs 26-28. Once
      those findings have been reached it is for the Secretary of  State  to
      balance them against  any  countervailing  factors  identified  before
      reaching a final conclusion on what period of leave should be granted.
       Ms Weston submits that in this case  the  cumulative  weight  of  the
      evidence strongly indicated that it would be in SM's best interests to
      be granted settlement in the United Kingdom. Clear  reasons  had  been
      advanced as to why it would be contrary to her best interests to grant
      her any  lesser  period  of  leave.    There  were,  by  contrast,  no
      countervailing  factors  of  any  significant   weight.     In   those
      circumstances there really was only room for one view: that SM  should
      have been granted ILR.




      The Secretary of State's Defence


  23. For the Secretary of State Mr Malik made three submissions.


  24. His first is that in the absence of a  formal,  paid  application  for
      indefinite leave to remain by SM there can be no legitimate  complaint
      that the Secretary of State did not grant such leave.   The  Secretary
      of State is obliged to apply the rules.  The  relevant  rule  for  the
      grant of ILR on private life grounds is paragraph 276DE. Each  of  the
      requirements  must  be  met  before  a  grant  of  ILR  can  in  those
      circumstances be granted.  One  of  those  requirements  is  [at  sub-
      paragraph (a)] that "the applicant has been in the United Kingdom with
      continuous leave on the grounds of private life for  a  period  of  at
      least 120 months".   Under paragraph 276DH of the Rules, an  applicant
      for ILR who fails to meet all of those requirements under 276E must be
      refused.  Further, paragraph 34 of the  Immigration  Rules  stipulates
      that an application for leave to remain must be made on an application
      form specified for the immigration category under which the  applicant
      is applying; where the applicant is required to pay a fee this must be
      paid in full in accordance with the process set out in the application
      form.  It is unarguably open to the Secretary of State, as a matter of
      law, to set down such procedures in the exercise of his duty under  s3
      of the 1971 Act: s50 of the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act
      2006.


  25. Since it is accepted that SM has made neither an application for  ILR,
      nor paid the fee for doing so, the Secretary of State's decision could
      not have been otherwise.  Mr  Malik  relied  in  this  regard  on  the
      decision in R (on the application of Alladin and Wadhwa)  v  Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ  1334  in  which  the
      Court of Appeal dismissed the case of  the  second  applicant  in  the
      following terms [at 70]:


         "As I have intimated, a striking feature of  Mr  Wadhwa's  case  is
         that at no stage did he make a clear request to  the  Secretary  of
         State for the grant of ILR. In  those  circumstances  it  would  be
         wrong to criticise the Secretary of State for granting DLR  in  the
         belief that she was acceding to the only application made."


  26. Mr Malik submitted that the Upper Tribunal have accepted this  passage
      in Lord Justice Floyd's judgment to be referring  to  a  paid,  formal
      application for ILR:  see  for  instance  R  (on  the  application  of
      Amitkumar  Pravinbhai  Patel)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department (duration of leave-policy) UKUT 00561 IAC) and  R  (on  the
      application of CS) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]
      (JR/6041/14).  That being the settled position,  SM's  case  was  over
      before it began.


  27. The second submission for the Secretary of State is that even  if  the
      initial decision could be said to be lacking in  reasons,  the  second
      decision, of the 16th April 2018, constituted a complete answer to all
      of the points made on SM's behalf. Clear reasons  were  given  therein
      why her circumstances were not found to be sufficiently exceptional to
      warrant a grant  of  settled  status.   Mr  Malik  stressed  that  the
      discretion conferred by s3(3) of the Immigration Act 1971 is  for  the
      Respondent to exercise.  This Tribunal's jurisdiction to  review  that
      exercise is, within the scope of  a  public  law  challenge,  limited.
      Where the Secretary  of  State  has  engaged  with  the  evidence  put
      forward, and has given reasons for his conclusions, it is not open  to
      this tribunal to interfere  with  that  decision-making  process.   In
      particular the Tribunal has no power  to  grant  indefinite  leave  to
      remain, nor to order the Secretary of State to do so: see for instance
      TN (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2015]
      UKSC 40.


  28. Mr Malik further submitted that insofar as  the  Applicant  sought  to
      rely on the decision of Mr  Justice  Holman  in  SM  and  Others  that
      reliance was misplaced, since that case was concerned  with  a  policy
      that is no longer in force. Mr Malik submitted that far  from  setting
      out any general principles, Holman J was simply addressing  the  facts
      in that case, in the context of the applicable policy.   The Secretary
      of State had amended his policy so as to comply with that judgment.


  29. Finally, Mr Malik submitted that even if a public law error  could  be
      identified in the letter of the 16th April, relief should  be  refused
      on the grounds that any reconsideration  by  the  Secretary  of  State
      would be highly likely to result in  the  same  outcome.   The  policy
      itself makes clear that the expectation is that all  migrants  on  the
      'private life' route will be eligible to apply for settlement after 10
      years. There is a clear public interest in the  Secretary  of  State's
      policies, and decision making, being  consistent.   That  is  why  the
      policy is couched in  terms  of  exceptionality.    The  circumstances
      faced by SM did not, on any analysis, meet that high threshold.




      Discussion and Findings


  30. I am asked to review two successive  decisions  of  the  Secretary  of
      State  concerning  the  grant  of  leave  to  this  minor   Applicant.
      Permission was granted on the 28th August 2018  by  His  Honour  Judge
      McKenna.


  31. I am satisfied that the first decision  letter,  that  dated  the  6th
      November 2017, entirely failed to address  the  clear  representations
      made by ASIRT. The letter addresses  none  of  the  detailed  evidence
      supplied; nor does it give any indication that the Secretary of  State
      has considered exercising his discretion in the Applicant's favour, or
      otherwise.


  32. Mr Malik did not dispute that the first letter is essentially void  of
      reasoning, but submitted that it was nevertheless a  lawful  response,
      because there was no legal obligation upon the Secretary of  State  to
      grant ILR, nor even to consider doing so.  SM had neither completed an
      application form for settlement, nor paid the  fee  to  make  such  an
      application.  Mr  Malik  submits  that  in  those  circumstances   the
      Secretary of State was not only alleviated of  any  responsibility  to
      consider granting settlement, but was in fact bound, by the  terms  of
      the rules, to refuse to grant ILR.


  33. In respect of applications made under the Rules, Mr Malik is of course
      quite correct.  Paragraph 276DE(a) requires applicants to  demonstrate
      that they have held continuous leave for a period of 10  years  before
      settlement  will  be  granted;  paragraph  276DH  mandates  that   any
      applicant who cannot meet that test must  be  refused.   Paragraph  34
      stipulates that applications under any given category of  leave  under
      the rules must be made on the correct form, and the correct fee  paid.
      All of that is true. SM could not meet the test at  276DE(a),  so  she
      did not bother completing  the  form  prescribed  in  accordance  with
      paragraph 34.


  34. That is not however the  end  of  the  matter.  That  is  because  the
      application made by  SM  was  made  squarely  outside  of  the  Rules.
      Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 (as amended) provides:



         3 General provisions for regulation and control.

         (1) Except as otherwise provided by or under this Act, where a
         person is not a British citizen-

         (a) he shall not enter the United Kingdom unless given leave to do
         so in accordance with the provisions of, or made under, this Act;

         (b)  he may be given leave to enter the United Kingdom (or, when
         already there, leave to remain in the United Kingdom) either for a
         limited or for an indefinite period;



         (2)The Secretary of State shall from time to time (and as  soon  as
         may be) lay before Parliament statements of the rules,  or  of  any
         changes in the rules, laid down by him as to  the  practice  to  be
         followed in the administration of this Act for regulating the entry
         into and stay in the United Kingdom of persons required by this Act
         to have leave to enter, including any rules as to  the  period  for
         which leave is to be given and the conditions  to  be  attached  in
         different circumstances; and section 1(4) above shall not be  taken
         to require uniform provision to be made by  the  rules  as  regards
         admission of persons for a purpose or in a  capacity  specified  in
         section 1(4) (and in particular, for this as well as other purposes
         of this Act, account may be taken of citizenship or nationality).
         ...


  35. It is uncontroversial that the discretion conferred by s3(1)(b) is not
      fettered by s3(2): whilst the  Rules  are  the  primary  statement  of
      policy as to how the Secretary of State will administer his duties, he
      retains a residual discretion that operates  outwith  that  framework.
      It was that discretion  that  SM  asked  the  Secretary  of  State  to
      exercise.


  36. I have been taken to nothing in statute or policy that restricted  her
      ability to do so; in particular I have found no support for Mr Malik's
      contention that the Secretary  of  State  could  properly  decline  to
      respond to SM's request because she hadn't filled in a specific  form.
      Mr Malik relied upon Alladin to submit that the Court of Appeal  there
      required the claimant to have  made  such  a  formal  application;  he
      further relies upon Patel and CS to submit  that  the  Upper  Tribunal
      prefers the interpretation of Alladin he advances.


  37. I  am  not  satisfied  that  any  of  these  authorities  support  his
      proposition. The high point of Mr Malik's case appears in the headnote
      of Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun's decision in Patel:


         "There is no obligation on the Secretary of State to grant  ILR  or
         to  consider  granting  ILR  in  circumstances  where   no   formal
         application for ILR has been made"


  38. Insofar as the words "formal application" could be read there to  mean
      a valid application as defined  at  paragraph  6  of  the  Immigration
      Rules, that headnote is unfortunately misleading. Nothing in the  body
      of the judgment itself indicates that Judge Eshun believed that to  be
      the case.   The applicants in Patel were a family whose cases had been
      returned to the Secretary of State for consideration after the  First-
      tier Tribunal  had  allowed  their  linked  appeals  on  human  rights
      grounds.   The Secretary of State had, in accordance with  the  Rules,
      granted each member of the family a period of 30 months' Discretionary
      Leave. The family had  sought  to  judicially  review  that  decision.
      Dismissing their claims, Judge Eshun accepted the Secretary of State's
      argument that their case was on fours with  that  of  Mr  Wadhwa,  the
      second appellant in Alladin, whose appeal had been  rejected  by  Lord
      Justice Floyd in the following terms:


         "As I have intimated, a striking feature of  Mr  Wadhwa's  case  is
         that at no stage did he make a clear request to  the  Secretary  of
         State for the grant of ILR. In  those  circumstances  it  would  be
         wrong to criticise the Secretary of State for granting DLR  in  the
         belief that she was acceding to the only application made."


  39. Note the language used: "at no stage did he  make  a  clear  request".
      Note the context: Alladin and  Wadhwa's  appeals  both  concerned  the
      exercise of discretion outside of the rules.  It is  perfectly  clear,
      from both that language and context, that the point was  not  that  Mr
      Wadhwa had failed to make a formal application for ILR,  but  that  he
      had failed to even ask the Respondent to exercise  his  discretion  in
      his favour before complaining about his failure to do so.    In  those
      circumstances his challenge was unarguable. So too was  the  case  for
      the Patels, who had similarly failed to make a specific  request  that
      the Secretary of State depart from the 'standard' grant of 30  months.
      As such the words "formal application" in the headnote of Patel should
      more accurately read "formal request".


  40. This interpretation is consistent with the decision of Upper  Tribunal
      Judge Smith in CS, and indeed with the Secretary  of  State's  own  in
      this case, since it is apparent from the letter of the 16th April 2018
      that the Secretary  of  State  understood  ASIRT  to  have  made  such
      request, and to have exercised his discretion 'outside of  the  rules'
      in responding to it.  It is further consistent with the terms  of  the
      policy itself,  which  makes  clear  that  it  is  not  only  open  to
      applicants for discretionary leave to request that a longer period  of
      leave is granted, but that where such a request is made, the Secretary
      of State is obliged to consider it:


         "If the applicant specifically requests a longer  period  of  leave
         than 30 months, or ILR, and provides reasons as to why they think a
         longer period of leave or ILR is appropriate  in  their  case,  the
         decision maker must consider this  and  set  out  in  any  decision
         letter why a grant of more than 30  months  or  ILR  has  not  been
         made".


         (my emphasis)


  41. See further  Behary  and  Anr  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2016] EWCA and Asiweh v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
      Department [2019] EWCA Civ 13 in which the Court of Appeal confirmed:


         "It is clear that when the Secretary of State is expressly asked to
         exercise his discretion to grant leave to  remain  outside  of  the
         Immigration Rules he is under a duty to do so".


  42. For the foregoing reasons I am satisfied that Mr Malik's submission is
      no answer to SM's criticisms of the decision of the 6th November 2017.
       That decision was unarguably flawed for all the reasons identified in
      the Applicant's grounds.


  43. The second letter is dated the 16th April  2018.  It  was  drafted  in
      response to a letter before action and  contains,  unlike  the  first,
      actual reasoning.


  44. At the centre of SM's complaint  about  his  second  decision  is  the
      Secretary of State's duty arising under  section  55  of  the  Borders
      Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009:



         55 Duty regarding the welfare of children

         (1) The Secretary of State must make arrangements for ensuring that-



         (a) the functions mentioned in subsection (2) are discharged having
         regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children
         who are in the United Kingdom, and

         (b) any services provided by another person pursuant to
         arrangements which are made by the Secretary of State and relate to
         the discharge of a function mentioned in subsection (2) are
         provided having regard to that need.

         (2) The functions referred to in subsection (1) are-

         (a) any function of the Secretary of State in relation to
         immigration, asylum or nationality;

         (b) any function conferred by or by virtue of the Immigration Acts
         on an immigration officer;

         (c) any general customs function of the Secretary of State;

         (d) any customs function conferred on a designated customs
         official.

         (3) A person exercising any of those functions must, in exercising
         the function, have regard to any guidance given to the person by
         the Secretary of State for the purpose of subsection (1)



  45. Any published policy, be it a rule or a guidance document, must on its
      face be compliant with the s.55 duty. Beyond that, s.55  imposes  upon
      decision-makers a duty to apply policy in a manner compliant with  the
      stated statutory aim: R (SM and Others) v Secretary of State  for  the
      Home Department [2013] EWHC 1144 (Admin). Because the duty applies  to
      "any function" the Secretary of State must consider it at  all  stages
      of the process: R (Granovski)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2015] EWHC 1478. In SM Holman J identified that in a  case
      such as this, that would require the decision  maker  to  ask  himself
      whether leave should be granted at all, and if so, of  what  duration:
      at both stages the best interests of any children involved would  have
      to be a primary consideration.


  46. Treating 'best interests' as a primary consideration does not  require
      decision makers to treat them as a  'trump  card'.  As  Baroness  Hale
      emphasised in  ZH  (Tanzania)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2011] UKSC 4, 'primary' means that they must be considered
      first, so that the findings of that enquiry can inform all  subsequent
      conclusions. It is not the same as 'paramount': the best interests  of
      a  child  can  be  outweighed  by  the  cumulative  effect  of   other
      considerations. In ZH "the countervailing factors  were  the  need  to
      maintain firm and fair immigration control, coupled with the  mother's
      appalling immigration history and the precariousness of  her  position
      when family life was created. But, as  the  tribunal  rightly  pointed
      out, the children were not to be blamed for that" [at �33].


  47. There can  be  no  dispute  that  the  policy  applied  to  SM's  case
      recognised the duty arising under s.55. Nor am I satisfied that on its
      face  the  policy  impermissibly  conflates   the   'best   interests'
      assessment with the exceptional or compelling factors  that  an  adult
      would need to demonstrate, since a clear distinction is drawn  between
      the two:


          "there may be rare cases in which either a longer period of  leave
         or an early grant of ILR is considered appropriate, either  because
         it  is  clearly  in  the  best  interests  of  a  child  (and   any
         countervailing factors do not outweigh  these  best  interests)  or
         because there are  other  particularly  exceptional  or  compelling
         reasons to grant leave for a longer period (or ILR)...


         In cases not involving children (as the main applicant or as family
         members included in the  application),  there  must  be  sufficient
         evidence to demonstrate the individual circumstances are  not  just
         unusual but can be distinguished to a high degree from other  cases
         the extent that it is necessary to deviate from the standard  grant
         of 30 months leave to remain...


         In cases involving children (as the main  applicant  or  as  family
         members included in the application), the decision-maker must  also
         have regard to the  best  interests  of  the  child  as  a  primary
         consideration (but not the only  or  the  paramount  consideration)
         when deciding the period of leave to be granted.
         ...
         (emphasis added)


  48. The questions for the decision maker in this case were therefore:


              i) Was  it  clearly  in  SM's  best  interests  to  grant  her
                 indefinite, rather than limited, leave;


             ii) If yes,  were  there  nevertheless  countervailing  factors
                 capable of displacing those  best  interests  such  that  a
                 'standard' grant of leave would remain appropriate.


  49. Ms Weston's case that the decision of  the  16th  April  2018  nowhere
      answers the first of these questions, and as a  result  any  purported
      answer to the second would be incomplete.  Mr Malik contends that  the
      letter adequately addressed all of the issues raised.


  50. The case put on SM's behalf, first in the initial  request  by  ASIRT,
      and then in the letter before action submitted by Central England  Law
      Centre, was that SM has already suffered a series of  traumas  in  her
      life:  her  parent's  divorce  and  consequent  custody  battle,   her
      witnessing of domestic violence by successive partners of her  mother,
      destitution and  deprivation,  emotional  abuse  by  her  step-father,
      insecurity, the threat of forced marriage  and  dislocation  from  her
      father. These historical stresses - if I may put it like that -   were
      the background to  the  current  challenges  that  this  child  faced,
      principally bullying at school, her sense of insecurity  and  her  own
      persistent self-harming.  Her school, mother, GP and  Birmingham  City
      Council Children's Services had all repeatedly expressed concern about
      her mental health issues. SM herself  explained  her  self-harming  as
      follows:


         "...I know that it is wrong and I know that it upsets my mum but it
         is something that I know I can do to give me a release and make  me
         feel that I am the one who is making decisions.  I have never  been
         able to make decisions and I have always had to watch other  people
         make decisions for me and my mum including the court and  the  Home
         Office and  my  dad  and  other  members  of  the  family  and  the
         community".


  51. The detailed reasons given in response were as follows:


         "Whilst your family were considered to be destitute  following  the
         breakdown of your mother's relationship with  her  second  husband,
         you and your mother have been granted leave to  remain  in  the  UK
         with a condition of stay permitting recourse to public  funds.   It
         is therefore considered that you will have  appropriate  access  to
         sources of benefits and accommodation as your  entitlements  permit
         and which should alleviate some of the concerns you have about your
         status in the UK. It is not  accepted  that  having  been  declared
         destitute, and since being given permission to  remain  in  the  UK
         with access to public funds, is a circumstance  exceptional  enough
         to warrant granting you ILR.  Many other migrants are in the UK who
         are being supported by local authorities as destitute  persons,  or
         who have limited leave to remain with the recourse to public funds,
         (and in many instances without such  a  recourse):  none  of  those
         persons have any automatic entitlement to ILR because of that.   It
         is also noted that your mother is educated to Masters degree level,
         and therefore she has the potential to seek to and  secure  gainful
         employment to reduce the reliance on public funds and overcome  the
         family's feelings of being destitute."


         Whilst you may have suffered from being in households  where  there
         have been histories of domestic  violence  and  abuse,  it  is  not
         accepted that this is a reason to grant you ILR.  As perturbing  as
         it is  in  the  modern  world  that  domestic  violence  and  abuse
         continues, it is not considered an exceptional  circumstance  where
         someone does not qualify for ILR under the Immigration Rules  as  a
         victim of domestic violence for the Secretary of State to  derogate
         outside the standard grant of 30  months  leave  to  remain  (where
         someone has been permitted to remain in the  UK  on  the  basis  of
         their family and/or private life).


         Whilst concerns  have  been  raised  about  you  being  potentially
         inducted into a forced marriage by your  own  father,  as  you  are
         currently permitted to remain in the UK there is no reason for  you
         to return to Pakistan where you would be at such a risk.   You  and
         your mother have no reason to inform your father  of  your  current
         residence in the UK such that you may be at harm of extended family
         members or friends of your father who may be in, or come to, the UK
         to seek your marriage against your will.  If any such incidents did
         occur, it would be open to you  and  your  mother  to  report  such
         matters to the relevant authorities.  Furthermore, no cogent reason
         has been forwarded as to why granting you  ILR  would  protect  you
         from being forcibly married.  Assuming you  have  no  intention  of
         returning to Pakistan as a single woman where you may be in danger,
         if you continue to meet the requirements of further leave to remain
         in the UK relative safety is secured whilst you remain here.   Your
         concerns about being forcibly married are therefore not seen as  an
         exceptional circumstance warranting a grant of ILR.


         Whilst you have been in the UK since you were three years  old  and
         have  British  citizen  siblings,  this  is   not   considered   an
         exceptional circumstance to grant you ILR.  With current  migration
         trends there are many families in the UK where some family  members
         are settled here or who  are  British  citizens  and  other  family
         members who are not, the latter of which may be going  through  the
         same probationary period of limited  periods  of  leave  to  remain
         until they become entitled to apply for ILR.


         Whilst the desire has been expressed to grant you ILR so as not  to
         prolong instability and precariousness which has characterised your
         life to date, it has not been borne out how a grant  of  ILR  would
         ameliorate the range of mental health issues  that  you  have.  You
         have been granted limited leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
         with access to public funds. As long as your  circumstances  remain
         the same and do not engage in any  activity  that  would  deem  you
         unsuitable to be here, your status upon review  should  remain  the
         same and you will face no  unnecessary  hardship  as  a  result  of
         having limited leave to remain.


         It is further noted that you have been recommended the  counselling
         because of your various psychological  problems  and  other  person
         with limited leave to remain in the UK, you would be able to access
         such treatments by the NHS and will not therefore be  disadvantaged
         as a result of having such limited leave to remain.

  52. The letter then sets out some observations  about  the  provision  for
      tertiary education before continuing:


         "Whilst it has been stated that you have been subject  to  bullying
         because of your immigration status it is noted that in  your  legal
         representatives Pre-Action Protocol letter of 5 January 2018, it is
         stated that you rarely disclose your immigration status  to  anyone
         even your close friends.  If  that  is  the  case,  it  would  seem
         contradictory to assert  that  you  are  being  bullied  over  your
         immigration status if you rarely disclose this information.  Living
         in Birmingham, which has a large resident  migrant  population,  it
         would seem doubtful that you attend a school where you are or  have
         been the only person who has been a migrant to the  UK,  and  whose
         immigration status may  be  perceived  as  being  precarious.   The
         Secretary of State would contend that your immigration status would
         not be a significant factor, if any, that would lead you  to  being
         bullied, but may be  more  predicated  on  matters  that  teenagers
         perceive as  being  divisive  and  which  fosters  what  seemed  an
         unfortunate pervasive and pernicious bullying culture prevalent  in
         today's society (particular within schools).   As  your  school  is
         aware of matters of you being bullied, it is  considered  that  the
         appropriate authority is at immediate hand during  school  time  to
         address issues of bullying within their sphere of influence.  It is
         not considered that this is an exceptional circumstance  warranting
         a grant of ILR to yourself, or that granting  ILR  would  alleviate
         any bullying that you unfortunately suffer.


         Whilst the victim support and GP letters indicate that  you  should
         be allowed to remain in the UK on a permanent basis, the  Secretary
         of State considers the context of their use of "permanent" in those
         letters as not one expressing that you should be granted  ILR,  but
         that it would not be in your interests to be forced  to  return  to
         Pakistan.  If the Secretary of State is wrong in  that  contention,
         neither victim support or your GP have provided any cogent  reasons
         why granting ILR to yourself would solve your mental health issues.
          It is also the Secretary of State's contention that in  discussing
         your situation with Victim Support and your GP it  is  likely  that
         any discussion that you would like  to  be  granted  ILR  would  be
         reconfirmed by them to us solely as an expression of  your  desire.
         It would be expected otherwise (and which  is  lacking)  clear  and
         meticulous reasoning as  to  why  granting  you  ILR  is  the  only
         solution to solving your problems and concerns.


         It must be reiterated that settlement in the UK is a privilege, not
         an  automatic  entitlement.  Unless  there  are  truly  exceptional
         reasons,  the  expectation  is  that  applicants  should  serve   a
         probationary period of limited leave before being eligible to apply
         for ILR if they meet the requirements.


         It is further noted that you did not apply  for  ILR  but  made  an
         application for limited leave the Secretary of State considers that
         it would be unfair to other migrants, including children  who  have
         to complete a probationary period before  being  eligible  for  ILR
         used  to  be  given  preferential  treatment,  especially   as   an
         application for ILR was made.   It  is  open  to  you  to  make  an
         application to settlement....


  53. I accept that this second  letter  is  considerably  better  than  the
      first. The decision-maker has acknowledged the evidence submitted  and
      has engaged with the request to grant settlement.   The  Secretary  of
      State has exercised his discretion, and as Mr Malik properly  reminded
      me, that is a matter for him.  I did not however understand it  to  be
      Ms Weston's  case  that  this  Tribunal  should  simply  supplant  the
      Secretary of State's exercise of discretion with its own. It is firmly
      established  that  this  would  be  impermissible:  see  for  instance
      Alladin, TN (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
      [2015] UKSC 40, R (S) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2007] EWCA Civ 546.  My task is limited to  identifying  whether  the
      decision is flawed for any of the public law errors alleged by SM, and
      if so whether relief should be granted.


  54. The first thing to be said about the reasoning in the letter is that I
      am unable to identify any analysis therein  of  the  Applicant's  best
      interests. This is a striking  omission  given  the  language  of  the
      policy, and the terms upon which the case was advanced by ASIRT.    Mr
      Malik sought to ameliorate that defect by pointing to  the  fact  that
      the decision-maker does address in turn each of the factors raised  on
      behalf of SM, and asked me to read those passages as  amounting  to  a
      best interests assessment.


  55. I am unable to do so.


  56. What ASIRT, and subsequently Central England Law Centre  did,  was  to
      set out the series of challenging life events  that  have  led  to  SM
      being the particularly vulnerable child that she is today.   What  the
      Secretary of State did was to take each of the individual traumas  and
      consider it in isolation before concluding: "it is not considered that
      this is an exceptional circumstance warranting a grant of ILR". Having
      thus dismissed the relevance of each discrete experience the decision-
      maker nowhere engages with the consequences of this  personal  history
      for SM. There is no global appraisal of the evidence. It is  difficult
      to conceive of a case where this would not be an  error  in  approach,
      but in a case such as this, which rested on the accumulative  toll  of
      these life events, it rendered the decision nonsensical. It was  never
      SM's case that any one of these factors should lead the  Secretary  of
      State to grant her leave: it was her case that 12 years of  successive
      traumas had left her particularly vulnerable and frightened about  her
      lack of settled status.


  57. This brings me to the central flaw in the Secretary of State's letter.
      The decision-maker repeatedly employs the language of  exceptionality.
      Had he there sought to reflect that this would have to be a  case  out
      of the normal run of things to justify departure from the Rules,  that
      would be legally permissible. It is however clear from  the  reasoning
      that the decision maker does not use the term it  in  that  sense.  It
      instead appears that he  was  looking  for  something  unique  in  the
      Applicant's circumstances:


         "Many other migrants are in the UK who are being supported by local
         authorities as destitute persons...none of those persons  have  any
         automatic entitlement to ILR because of that...."


         "There are many families in the UK where some  family  members  are
         settled here or who are British citizens and other  family  members
         who are not...."


         "Living  in  Birmingham,  which  has  a  large   resident   migrant
         population, it would seem doubtful that you attend a  school  where
         you are or have been the only person who has been a migrant to  the
         UK,  and  whose  immigration  status  may  be  perceived  as  being
         precarious".


  58. I am satisfied that in approaching his task in this way the  decision-
      maker appears to have misunderstood, or misapplied,  the  policy  that
      framed his decision, by failing to recognise that the applicant was  a
      child.  The policy does not confine the grant of ILR to  children  who
      can demonstrate that a very high or 'exceptional' threshold is reached
      - to do so would of course undermine the very principle of s.55.   For
      that reason, the policy draws  clear  distinction  between  adult  and
      child. In respect of adults, decision-makers  are  instructed  not  to
      grant a longer period of leave unless the  applicant  can  demonstrate
      that his circumstances "are not just unusual but can be  distinguished
      to a high degree from other cases":  this would appear  to  have  been
      the approach adopted in SM's case.  But SM was not an adult.   She did
      not have to show that she was unique, or that no other  children  were
      suffering in a manner comparable to her. She simply had to demonstrate
      (as a preliminary matter) that it was clearly in her best interests to
      grant her indefinite, as opposed to limited, leave to remain.


  59. For the foregoing reasons I am not satisfied that  the  decision-maker
      understood that to be the task before him. I  am  therefore  satisfied
      that the decision was flawed inter alia for a failure to discharge the
      statutory duty under s.55 of the Borders Citizenship  and  Immigration
      Act 2009, and for a failure to apply and/or a misinterpretation of the
      Secretary of State's published policy.


  60. Mr Malik's final  defence  submission  was  that  should  this  be  my
      finding, I should nevertheless refuse to grant relief on  the  grounds
      that even absent the defects in the decisions, the outcome was  highly
      likely to have been the same.  Ms Weston, by contrast, invites  me  to
      find that on the facts presented, there really is only  room  for  one
      view: that ILR should have been granted.


  61. The Secretary of State's policy, expressed in both rule and  guidance,
      is that where an applicant, be  they  adult  or  child,  is  found  to
      qualify for leave to remain on  Article  8  grounds,  the  appropriate
      grant of leave will normally be 30 months. At the end of  that  period
      the applicant can make an application for further leave, and if he  or
      she still qualifies, a further grant of 30 months will be  made.  This
      process is then repeated on two further occasions until the  applicant
      has accrued the requisite period of 120 months  continuous  residence;
      it is only at that point that the Secretary of  State  would  normally
      consider granting ILR.   Whether decision-makers  should  depart  from
      that norm, and grant a longer or indefinite period of leave before the
      10 year mark is reached, is dependent upon a number of factors.


  62. The first is whether the applicant has specifically requested that the
      Secretary of State grant a 'non-standard' period of leave. I am wholly
      satisfied that SM did so. The letter from ASIRT was set out  in  clear
      terms and was supported  by  detailed  submissions  and  corroborative
      evidence.


  63. The second question is whether, having conducted a holistic assessment
      of the evidence presented, it could be said that  it  was  clearly  in
      SM's best interests to be granted ILR. I need not rehearse all of  the
      sad facts elucidated by ASIRT.   The point that  was  being  made  was
      that this is a child  who  has  in  the  past  suffered  a  number  of
      difficult and traumatic experiences. The consequence of that  past  is
      that she is at present a child who is finding  it  very  difficult  to
      cope.   She is, as her Deputy Headteacher attests, a bright child  who
      has the potential to thrive.  The  troubling  import  of  all  of  the
      evidence is however  that  she  is  unable  to  do  so  because  of  a
      prevailing sense of insecurity and instability in her life.


  64. In her witness statement dated the 29th  January  2018  the  Applicant
      explains the "hatred" she feels towards her green  Pakistani  passport
      and how she only now identifies as British:


         "My experience of  the  immigration  system  up  to  now  has  been
         extremely stressful, and I have just felt really insecure  for  the
         past 12 years. It is always at the back of my head. I feel  like  I
         am regarded by the United Kingdom's authorities as 'not  belonging'
         but I very much regard myself as a British  national  and  I  don't
         identify with anywhere else and cannot see myself  living  anywhere
         other than here".


      She further sets out her fears of being seen as a 'freshie',  how  her
      'secret' has impacted upon her relationships with her peers and  gives
      instances where her sense of insecurity about her  immigration  status
      has directly led to her self-harming by cutting herself with  a  razor
      blade.


  65. The Secretary of State, in the letter of the 16th April 2018,  appears
      to diminish the weight to be attached to that evidence  on  the  basis
      that any fears that SM might hold about her long-term future  are  not
      well-founded. Adverse commentary is also offered about why bullies  at
      school would know about the Applicant's status. Insofar as the  latter
      issue is concerned, it is clear from her statement that  there  is  no
      contradiction in the evidence.  The  Applicant  confided  in  a  close
      friend, that information was  leaked,  and  it  ended  up  being  used
      against her in verbal taunts and  online  messages  described  by  her
      Deputy Headteacher as "nasty".  I am quite satisfied that there was no
      logical basis to reject SM's evidence. She did not need  to  establish
      that her fear - for instance of forced marriage - was objectively well-
      founded.  The  point  was  that  she  was  experiencing  a  subjective
      response to external stimuli, chief amongst them being her  precarious
      immigration status.


  66. That SM finds her ongoing experience to be  "extremely  stressful"  is
      entirely consistent with the findings of the Office of the  Children's
      Commissioner  in  their  August  2017  literature  review  'Children's
      Voices: A review of  the  evidence  on  the  subjective  wellbeing  of
      children subject to immigration control in England':


         "Children subject to immigration control,  and  particularly  those
         awaiting a decision or on a short term period of leave to remain in
         the UK, reported experiencing high levels of  anxiety,  stress  and
         fear in  relation  to  their  insecure  immigration  status,  their
         uncertainty about their future in the UK  and  the  possibility  of
         being forced to return to their countries  of  origin.  The  trauma
         caused by living in a 'state of  limbo'  emerged  as  the  dominant
         source of stress and anxiety in migrant children's lives,  and  the
         most important determinant of  their  wellbeing.  It  also  reduced
         their ability to recover from trauma they had  experienced  in  the
         past.


         Children  overwhelmingly  perceived  their  immigration  status  as
         outside of their control, and as a result felt powerless,  stripped
         of their agency, and forced to live in  sort  of  limbo,  passively
         awaiting a decision"


  67. It is  now  trite  that  an  important  part  of  the  best  interests
      assessment is discovering the child's own views. This is underlined by
      the Supreme Court in ZH (Tanzania) [at �34]. In the  policy  published
      to coincide with  the  coming  into  force  of  s55  UKVI  staff  were
      instructed that the following should be taken into account in order to
      safeguard and promote the welfare of children:


         . Children and young people are listened to and what they have  to
           say is taken seriously and acted on


         . Where possible the wishes and feelings of the  particular  child
           are obtained and taken into account when deciding on  action  to
           be undertaken in relation to him or her.


  68. The wishes and feelings of SM could not  be  plainer.   They  were  an
      important part of the 'best interests' assessment.


  69. The Secretary of State was not asked,  however,  to  depart  from  the
      Rules on the strength  of  SM's  evidence  alone.  Her  statement  was
      supported by  cogent  external  evidence,  including  the  information
      provided by her Deputy Headteacher, her GP and the  specialist  Victim
      Caseworker tasked with supporting  SM  through  the  bullying.   Three
      clear points emerge from the evidence of these independent  witnesses:
      that the Applicant is extremely vulnerable,  that  her  mental  health
      issues are significant (and in fact deteriorating) and that she  would
      immediately benefit from a grant  of  indefinite  leave  because  this
      would alleviate a good deal of the stress that she is experiencing.


  70. The question for the decision-maker was whether, taking  all  of  that
      into account, it was clearly in SM's  best  interests  to  be  granted
      indefinite rather than limited leave. The Secretary of  State's  view,
      as expressed in the policy provided:


         "if there was evidence that the child was seriously  distressed  by
         the prospect of a grant of limited leave it might be concluded that
         it would be in the child's best interest to grant the child ILR  to
         provide a greater degree of certainty for  the  purposes  of  their
         continued treatment or mental well-being".


  71. There was evidence which indicated that in SM's own view, and  in  the
      view of professionals working with her, her serious stress and  mental
      health issues would be alleviated by a permanent grant of leave. There
      was evidence which indicated that the precariousness of her  situation
      was not only causing SM anxiety but  had  been  used  by  others  (her
      former stepfather, peers at  school  and  online)  to  psychologically
      abuse and bully her.  There was, importantly, also clear evidence that
      SM's  immediate  family  were  in  the   United   Kingdom   and   were
      overwhelmingly likely to remain here. Her  two  younger  brothers  are
      British and their father resident here; as such her  mother  continues
      to qualify for leave and is on a path to  settlement.    All  of  that
      evidence pointed one way: it was clearly in  SM's  best  interests  to
      grant her indefinite leave to remain today.  If there was evidence  to
      the contrary, it was not brought to my attention.


  72. The third question for  the  decision-maker  was  whether  there  were
      countervailing factors of sufficient  weight  to  displace  SM's  best
      interests.  Given the Secretary of State's recognition of SM's Article
      8 rights she cannot lawfully be removed from the United Kingdom; given
      the nationality of her minor brothers, and position of her mother,  it
      is extremely unlikely that this will at any point become the case.  It
      is very difficult in those circumstances to see  that  the  ordinarily
      powerful public interest in 'maintaining  immigration  control'  would
      here be particularly  relevant.  Mr  Malik  emphasised,  however,  the
      strong public interest in  the  outcome  of  such  applications  being
      decided in a consistent and predictable way, in line  with  the  clear
      statement of policy set out in the Immigration Rules. In his  decision
      of the 16th April 2019 the Secretary of State suggested that "it would
      be unfair to other migrants (including children) who have to  complete
      a probationary period before being eligible for ILR  for  [SM]  to  be
      given preferential treatment". I accept  that  that  is  an  important
      consideration. It will however only be unfair to  other  children  who
      are in a comparable situation to that  which  SM  unfortunately  finds
      herself in. It cannot logically be said to be unfair to  children  who
      are unable to demonstrate that their best interests require a  longer,
      or indefinite, grant of leave.




      Conclusion


  73. The decisions of the  6th  November  2017  and  16th  April  2018  are
      quashed.


  74. The Respondent is ordered to reconsider the  Applicant's  request  for
      indefinite leave to remain in accordance with  the  policy  considered
      herein, with his obligations under s.55 of the Borders Citizenship and
      Immigration Act 2009, and with the terms of this judgment.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
