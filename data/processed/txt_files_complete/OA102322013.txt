                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Not represented
For the appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Treachea Adina Gentles, date  of  birth  12.11.78,  is  a
    citizen of Jamaica.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Canavan, who allowed the claimant's appeal
    against the decision of the respondent, dated 17.4.13,  to  refuse  her
    application made on 11.2.13 for entry clearance to the  United  Kingdom
    for settlement as the spouse of  Barrington  Dale  Gentles,  a  British
    Citizen.  The Judge heard the appeal on 13.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    9.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.8.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. There was no attendance by the sponsor or on behalf of the claimant.  I
    note that on 16.5.14 notice of today's hearing was sent to the claimant
    and the sponsor at the address held on file for the sponsor. There  has
    been no response. Neither has there been a  Rule  24  response  to  the
    grounds of appeal or the grant  of  permission  to  appeal.  A  contact
    number was found from the First-tier Tribunal papers  for  the  sponsor
    and a message left on voicemail but no response was forthcoming. I note
    that the sponsor has been visiting Jamaica and it may be  that  he  has
    returned there again. In the circumstances, I decided that  it  was  in
    the public interest to proceed to determine this appeal without further
    adjournment.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Canavan should be set aside.

 7. It is clear from the determination that the claimant could not meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and in particular  the  specified
    evidence under Appendix FM-SE in relation to the  sponsor's  employment
    and income in the UK.

 8. At �9 of the determination the judge  found  no  breach  of  article  8
    private life by the decision of the Entry Clearance  Officer.  However,
    Judge Canavan went on to make an article 8 family life  assessment  and
    find the decision disproportionate.

 9. The grounds of application for permission to appeal complain  that  the
    judge failed to have regard to the case law guidance of Gulshan, to the
    effect that only if there are arguably good grounds for granting  leave
    to remain outside the Immigration Rules is it necessary for  article  8
    purposes  to  go  on  to  consider   whether   there   are   compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules. I note  here
    that the grounds assume an application for leave to remain,  when  this
    is an application for entry clearance, but the principle is  the  same.
    From �15 onwards of the determination  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    simply proceeded to make a free-standing article 8  assessment.  It  is
    submitted that without making findings as to arguably good grounds  and
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  the  Rules,
    the decision is flawed and should be set aside.

10. In  granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  noted  that
    although  it  was  conceded  that  the  claimant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  for  entry  as  a
    partner, insufficient weight appears to have been accorded to that fact
    in the overall decision. "The judge attaches insufficient weight to the
    fact that the appellant has been residing voluntarily in Jamaica for in
    the region of 6 years with her children without difficulty. So has  the
    sponsor over a considerable period. There appears to be no  reason  why
    the sponsor cannot return to Jamaica if he wishes. After  all,  he  has
    lived there for a number of years.  He  clearly  has  extended  family.
    Moreover his medical condition, previously unknown to  the  respondent,
    has arisen since the date of decision and was not supported by  medical
    evidence. It is arguable the stand alone article 8 decision is  flawed.
    All the grounds are arguable."

11. Although the First-tier Tribunal hearing took place in May 2014,  Judge
    Canavan appears to have given no consideration to recent  case  law  on
    considering article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

12. The sponsor was not exempt from the financial requirements of  Appendix
    FM, but he claimed to have an income in excess of that  required  under
    the Rules. However, the claimant and the sponsor failed to  submit  the
    specified evidence  required  under  FM-SE  to  evidence  that  income.
    Neither  was  there  evidence  of  adequate   accommodation.   In   the
    circumstances the application was refused. At �8  Judge  Canavan  found
    that the decision was in accordance with the Immigration Rules.

13. Having found the appellant  does  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain, the question next arises whether
    the claimant's circumstances justify granting the  application  outside
    the Immigration Rules on the basis of article 8 as the decision of  the
    Secretary of State produces a result that is unjustifiably  harsh.  The
    case law over the past 12 months has suggested a  particular  approach,
    developed over a number of months.

14. In MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the Court of  Appeal  held
    that in relation to deportation cases the 'new' Immigration Rules are a
    complete code but involve the application of  a  proportionality  test.
    Whether that is done within the new rules or outside the new  rules  as
    part of the article 8 general law was described as a sterile  question,
    as either way the result should be  the  same;  what  matters  is  that
    proportionality balancing exercise is required to be  carried  out.  In
    other words, a proportionality test is required whether under  the  new
    rules or article 8. MF (Nigeria) was followed in Kabia (MF: para 398  -
    "exceptional circumstances") 2013 UKUT 00569 (IAC).

15. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) has set out, inter  alia,  that  on  the  current  state  of  the
    authorities:

          (b)    after applying the requirements of the Rules, only if there
         may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain  outside
         them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider
         whether  there  are  compelling  circumstances   not   sufficiently
         recognised under them: R (on the application of) Nagre v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);

16. The case also explained that  the  Secretary  of  State  addressed  the
    Article 8 family aspects  of  the  respondent's  position  through  the
    Rules,  in  particular  EX1,  and  the  private  life  aspects  through
    paragraph 276ADE. Only if there were arguably good grounds for granting
    leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for him for  Article
    8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were  compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the Rules.

17. More recently, in Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  [2014]  UKUT  00085
    (IAC), the Upper Tribunal held:

         (i)  Failure on the part of the Secretary of State to  identify  in
         her decision any legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR does
         not prevent a court or tribunal from seeking to do so on the  basis
         of the materials before it.

          (ii)  "Maintenance of effective immigration control" whilst not as
         such a legitimate aim under Article 8(2) of the ECHR  can  normally
         be assumed to be either an aspect of  "prevention  of  disorder  or
         crime" or an aspect of "economic  well-being  of  the  country"  or
         both.

           (iii)   "[P]revention  of  disorder  or  crime"  is  normally   a
         legitimate aim  both  in  expulsion  cases  where  there  has  been
         criminal conduct on the part of the claimant and in expulsion cases
         where there have only been breaches of immigration law.

          (iv)   MF (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  held  that  the  new
         immigration rules regarding deportation of a foreign criminal are a
         complete code. This was because of the express requirement in  them
         at paragraph 398 to have regard to  exceptional  circumstances  and
         other factors.

          (v)    It follows from this  that  any  other  rule  which  has  a
         similar provision will also constitute a complete code;

          (vi)  Where an area of the rules does not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31]  in  particular)
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640 (IAC) should be followed: i.e. after applying the  requirements
         of the rules, only if  there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
         granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for Article 8
         purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
         circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

18. Although case law continues to develop, the current position is perhaps
    best expressed in paragraph 135 of  R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 985:

         "135.  Where the relevant group of IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."

19. At �10 the judge appears to have applied the previous understanding  of
    the law that there was always a two-stage process, consideration  under
    the Rules and then a freestanding human rights assessment  outside  the
    Rules. As indicated above, the case law has move on  considerably  from
    that position. Before embarking on an article 8 assessment outside  the
    Rules, Judge  Canavan  should  have  considered  whether  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules provided a 'complete code' to address the  claimant's
    article 8 rights to respect for family life. It  is  open  to  argument
    that the necessary exclusion of EX1 for  out  of  country  applications
    meant that there was no consideration of insurmountable  obstacles  and
    thus no effect proportionality assessment. However,  no  such  argument
    was raised before me. Mr Avery suggested  that  the  Immigration  Rules
    under Appendix FM amounted to a complete code.  However,  the  decision
    itself did not consider article 8. It was only in the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager review that article 8 was addressed. In the  circumstances,  it
    appears to me that there has been a  consideration  of  the  claimant's
    circumstances and a proportionality assessment outside the  Immigration
    Rules.

20. I am not satisfied that  the  findings  of  Judge  Canavan  demonstrate
    anything  which  could  be  described   as   compelling   circumstances
    insufficiently recognised in the Immigration Rules  and  requiring  the
    application to be granted outside the Rules under  article  8,  on  the
    basis that the decision of the Secretary  of  State  was  unjustifiably
    harsh. Without a correct approach to determine whether the  Immigration
    Rules are a complete code for  the  facts  of  this  case,  it  is  not
    possible to be satisfied that  the  ensuing  assessment  was  correctly
    made.

21. Further, I find that the article 8 assessment was  itself  flawed.  The
    judge failed to take into account that the claimant failed to meet  the
    requirements of the Rules, although the sponsor claimed an income  that
    would meet the Rules. It is also relevant to any article  8  assessment
    outside the Rules that there remains a route for  entry  of  a  partner
    under section EC-P of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Given  the
    alleged ill-health of the sponsor it  may  be  that  the  claimant  and
    sponsor will not  have  to  meet  the  normal  financial  threshold  of
    Appendix FM, should they choose to make a further application. That she
    can make such an application is, of  course,  highly  relevant  to  any
    article 8 assessment, but does not  appear  to  have  been  taken  into
    account in Judge Canavan's assessment. The claimant is not entitled  to
    settle in the UK simply because that is her desire. Failure  to  comply
    with the Immigration Rules does not strengthen an article 8 claim.

22. I note that at �19 of the determination the judge relied on MM & Ors  v
    SSHD [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin), but that case has now been overturned by
    the Court of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) & Ors [2014] EWCA Civ 985.

23. I note that the judge  took  account  of  the  best  interests  of  the
    claimant's two British citizen children, who are entitled to reside  in
    the UK. However, in reliance on T (s55 BCIA  2009  -  entry  clearance)
    Jamaica [2011] UKUT 00483, the judge  failed  to  appreciate  that  the
    Upper Tribunal held in  that  case  that  section  55  of  the  Borders
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 does not apply to children who are
    outside the UK. Further, there are no concerns raised in this case that
    the children's welfare is being jeopardised by their residence with the
    claimant in Jamaica. They cannot be excluded from coming to the UK, but
    at present and for the past several years they have  been  settled  and
    raised in Jamaica. In the  circumstances,  consideration  of  the  best
    interests of the children in this case does  not  take  the  article  8
    assessment any further.

24. I also find that the judge failed to take  sufficient  account  of  the
    fact that the claimant chose to return to Jamaica, and has been  living
    there voluntarily for a  number  of  years,  often  with  the  sponsor.
    Despite his recent claim of  ill-health,  unsupported  by  satisfactory
    medical evidence, he again travelled to Jamaica  recently.  It  is  the
    nature of the family life adopted voluntarily by the claimant  and  her
    family that he shuttled between Jamaica and the UK.

25. In the circumstances and for the reasons stated, I find such  error  of
    law in the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  that  it
    should be set aside and remade.

26. In remaking the decision I take account of the all the matters set  out
    above without having  to  repeat  them.  I  find  nothing  particularly
    compelling about the circumstances of the  claimant,  the  sponsor,  or
    their children. The claimant chose to return to Jamaica in 2008 and the
    children have been raised there since that  time,  some  6  years.  The
    sponsor was content to travel between Jamaica and the UK spending  time
    between the UK and his family in Jamaica. I am not satisfied that there
    is any basis to consider article 8 outside the Rules. I do not find the
    decision of the Secretary of State to be  unjustifiably  harsh  on  the
    facts of this case.

27. Even if a  stand-alone  article  8  assessment  outside  the  Rules  is
    justified on the facts of this case, on the basis that the Rules for an
    out of country applicant do not permit of a proportionality assessment,
    the appeal still fails.

28. I find on the application of the Razgar five step assessment  that  the
    decision may sufficiently interfere with the claimant and her  family's
    rights to respect for family life so as to engage article  8.  However,
    in conducting the proportionality balancing exercise between on the one
    hand the rights of the claimant and her family and  on  the  other  the
    legitimate and necessary interests  of  the  state  in  protecting  the
    economic  well-being  of  the  UK  through  the  fair   and   objective
    application  of  immigration   control,   the   decision   is   clearly
    proportionate and not disproportionate to the family life rights,  even
    when taking into account the best interests of the two British  citizen
    children. In reaching that conclusion, I take into  account  all  those
    matters set out above as well as those  relied  on  by  Judge  Canavan.
    However, I have to bear in mind that the claimant purports to  be  able
    to meet the requirements of the Rules and that it is  open  to  her  to
    make a fresh application, marshalling the correct evidence. It  remains
    for the claimant to demonstrate that she can meet the  requirements  of
    the Rules. I fail to see how in those circumstances the decision of the
    Secretary of State could be regarded as disproportionate.

29. In addition, I am now required to take into account  section  117A  and
    117B  of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,   when
    considering the public interest. Sections 117B(1), (2) and (3) set  out
    general principles of immigration policy.  Those seeking  to  enter  or
    stay in the UK should meet the requirements of immigration  control  as
    set out in the Immigration Laws and Immigration  Rules.   In  addition,
    migrants should be able to speak English and be financially independent
    in order to be able to integrate into society and not to be a burden on
    taxpayers.  When carrying out the balancing exercise the Tribunal might
    expect that a person who cannot meet one or more of these criteria will
    have to show clear evidence and reasons why  their  circumstances  mean
    that the usual policy considerations do not apply to them.  This  might
    be because of exceptional circumstances or compassionate and compelling
    factors but there is no test of exceptionality as such.   Applying  the
    relevant public interest,  it  is  in  the  public  interest  that  the
    claimant in seeking to enter the UK be able  to  demonstrate  that  she
    will  be  financially  independent.  That  is  best  done  through   an
    application under appendix FM and the financial  requirements.  In  the
    absence of satisfactory evidence that the claimant will be  financially
    independent, the public interest is not outweighed in this case.

30. In the circumstances and for  the  reasons  stated,  I  find  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was  correct  and  should  stand.  I
    further find that the decision was entirely proportionate to the family
    life rights of the claimant and her family.

Conclusions:

31. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed.
