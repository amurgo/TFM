                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home  Department
        (appellant) against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
        Abrese  (FtJ),  promulgated  on  17  November  2016,  allowing   the
        respondent's  appeal  against  the  appellant's  refusal,  dated  16
        September 2015, of his human rights claim made on 22 January 2015.




   Background

     2. It is pertinent to note at the outset that the FtJ made a number  of
        unchallenged findings in  regard  to  the  respondent's  immigration
        history. The respondent is a national of Jamaica, date  of  birth  2
        February 1979.  He entered the UK on 26 June 1998  and  was  granted
        further leave to remain valid until 30 September 1999 as a  student.
        The respondent maintains, and the FtJ  found  as  a  fact,  that  he
        submitted an application  for  further  leave  to  remain  order  to
        continue his studies. He did not hear from the appellant and  became
        concerned as his passport was retained  by  the  appellant  and  the
        respondent needed it to attend a trip to Barcelona as  part  of  his
        course. When he finally managed to speak to  somebody  at  the  Home
        Office in 2000 the respondent  was  informed  that  he  was  now  an
        overstayer and that his file had been closed since  September  1999.
        The respondent sent in a letter of complaint and, whilst waiting for
        a response, enrolled at another  college.  Despite  writing  to  the
        appellant on numerous  occasions,  confirmed  by  reference  to  the
        correspondence covering the period 1998 to  2008  contained  in  his
        bundle before the First-tier Tribunal and identified by the  FtJ  at
        [29] to [33] of his decision, there appears to have been no adequate
        response by the appellant.

     3. Eventually in September 2007 the respondent applied for the issuance
        of a residence card confirming his right to reside in the  UK  as  a
        family member of an EEA national. There was a delay  in  considering
        this application. The residence card, which was  eventually  granted
        on  18  November  2009,  was  valid  until  18  November  2014.  The
        respondent's relationship with his EEA national partner  broke  down
        in 2011.

     4. On 22 January 2015 the respondent applied for  indefinite  leave  to
        remain on the basis of his long residence. The appellant  approached
        this application on the basis that it was a human rights claim.  The
        appellant was not satisfied that the respondent had accrued at least
        10 years continuous lawful residence. The appellant noted that there
        was no evidence that the respondent was in a subsisting relationship
        with his former  EEA  national  partner.  The  appellant  noted  the
        respondent's claim to now have a British citizen partner ([MW])  but
        there was said to be no evidence of a subsisting relationship. There
        were  said  to  be  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family   life
        continuing outside the UK in any event. The respondent did not  meet
        the requirements for leave to remain under paragraph 276 ADE of  the
        immigration rules,  and  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances
        sufficient to warrant  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  outside  the
        immigration rules in accordance with article 8.

The First-tier Tribunal decision

     5. The FtJ heard from both the respondent and [MW],  his  partner.  The
        FtJ found, and this has not been challenged, that the respondent and
        [MW] were credible witnesses,  that  they  were  in  a  genuine  and
        subsisting relationship, that this relationship  had  endured  since
        2014 (although they met each other in  2011),  that  the  respondent
        earned �37,500 per annum and that [MW] earned in excess of  �18,600,
        that the respondent was Christian and his partner  was  Muslim,  and
        that this was likely to cause tension with [MW]'s family. During the
        submissions  the  Presenting  Officer  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        hearing accepted that there had been a delay caused by the Secretary
        of State, but that the respondent would have been aware  since  2011
        that he had no right to remain in this country.

     6. The FtJ found that the respondent did not meet the  requirements  of
        paragraph 276ADE. Although he resided in the UK for  a  considerable
        period of time the respondent maintained links with  his  family  in
        Jamaica, he had insight into Jamaican culture and society and  could
        look for employment with the skills and experience  gained  in  this
        country. There were no very significant obstacles to his integration
        in Jamaica. Although it would  be  difficult  for  the  respondent's
        partner to move to Jamaica she was willing to do so if this was  the
        only option available to her. Although the FtJ found that there  may
        be obstacles to her relocation, these would not be  significant  and
        could be overcome.

     7. The FtJ then considered whether there were factors  outside  of  the
        immigration rules, consistent with article 8, rendering the  refusal
        of the human rights claim  disproportionate.  The  FtJ  adopted  the
        approach in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. The FtJ  took  into  account  the
        factors identified in section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration
        and Asylum Act 2002 (although the judge referred to section 117B  of
        the Immigration Act 2014, nothing turns on this  mistake).  The  FtJ
        found that the respondent had contributed through his employment  by
        paying taxes and had not been a burden on public funds, that he  had
        integrated into British society and had made a positive contribution
        to British  society.  None  of  these  factual  findings  have  been
        challenged. The FtJ found that the respondent failed to  inform  the
        appellant that his relationship with  his  ex-EEA  national  partner
        broke down 2011, and that he admitted this. The  FtJ  accepted  that
        the respondent had formed  strong  relationships  with  friends  and
        members of his family in the UK.

     8. At [57] and then from [60] to  [63]  the  FtJ  considered  the  very
        significant delay by the appellant in considering  the  respondent's
        further application for leave and  in  responding  to  his  numerous
        letters. The FtJ identified the delay as being "extreme" noting that
        the appellant failed to  carry  out  the  appropriate  steps  or  to
        formulate a proper response. The FtJ found that this had  an  impact
        on the respondent in that he continued to reside in this country and
        to develop and enhance his relationships with his partners and other
        family members. The judge  considered  the  principles  relating  to
        delay established in EB (Kosovo) [2008] UKHL 41 and whether  such  a
        delay would have an impact on the public interest factors supporting
        the respondent's removal. The FtJ concluded that the respondent  had
        been "prejudiced" by the delay in relation to his immigration status
        and that the appellant's inactivity during the period of  her  delay
        had an impact on the respondent's private life in the  UK.  The  FtJ
        then quoted from EB (Kosovo) in respect of the ways in which a delay
        may be relevant. Purporting to apply the principles  established  in
        EB (Kosovo) the FtJ found that the delay  strengthened  the  private
        life relationships established by the respondent in the  UK.  Having
        considered all the evidence in the round, including the respondent's
        residence in excess of 17 years, and the fact that he  had  adjusted
        and acclimatized himself to the customs and norms  in  the  UK,  and
        concluded  that  it  would  not  be  proportionate  to  remove   the
        respondent. The appeal was allowed under article 8 grounds.

The grounds of appeal and the grant of permission

     9. The grounds contend that the FtJ failed  to  follow  the  principles
        established in SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 387  in  that
        he did not identify compelling  reasons  for  looking  at  the  case
        outside the immigration rules. The FtJ failed  to  explain  how  the
        respondent's status was prejudiced by the  appellant's  delay  given
        that he was issued with an EEA residence card in  2009  and  had  no
        right  to  reside  in  the  UK  following  the  breakdown   of   his
        relationship in 2011. It was submitted that the  FtJ  misapplied  EB
        (Kosovo) as the fact that the respondent had longer to  establish  a
        private life as a  result  of  the  delay  did  not  mean  that  his
        application should succeed, particularly in light  of  the  findings
        that there were no significant obstacles to the respondent's  return
        to Jamaica. Permission was granted on the basis that it was arguable
        that the FtJ  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  the
        existence of compelling circumstances  and  that  he  misapplied  EB
        (Kosovo).

    10. At the hearing Mr Avery adopted and expanded upon  the  grounds.  It
        was submitted that the FtJ did not immediately identify what it  was
        that caused him to look at the appeal  outside  of  the  immigration
        rules. The FtJ failed to take into  account  the  three-year  period
        between 2011 and 2014 when the respondent was aware that he  had  no
        basis to remain and failed to  take  any  steps  to  leave.  It  was
        submitted that the delay in the circumstances was not compelling and
        that it was difficult to see what prejudice had been suffered by the
        respondent as a result of the delay.

    11. Mr Cantor submitted that the delay was properly regarded by the  FtJ
        as a compelling circumstance. There had been  no  challenge  by  the
        appellant to the findings of significant delay.  The proportionality
        assessment was ultimately a matter for the FtJ to decide and he  was
        entitled to attach significant weight to the delay.

Discussion

    12. The grounds did not challenge the FtJ's factual findings in  respect
        to the nature and extent of the appellant's delay  in  dealing  with
        the respondent's application and  correspondence  between  1999  and
        2007. By all accounts this delay was  considerable.  No  explanation
        was offered by the appellant for the delay. Following EB (Kosovo)  a
        significant delay by the appellant  in  determining  an  application
        may, as well as, enabling a person to develop  closer  personal  and
        social ties and establish deeper roots  in  the  community  than  he
        otherwise have done,  and  therefore  strengthening  his  article  8
        private life, reduce the weight that would otherwise attach  to  the
        public interest factors underpinning the removal  of  a  person  who
        does not meet the formal requirements of the immigration rules.

    13. It is satisfactorily clear that these were the principles  that  the
        FtJ had in mind when stating,  at  [60],  that  the  respondent  was
        "prejudiced"  in  relation  to  his  immigration   status   by   the
        significant delay. Although the  FtJ's  reasoning  could  have  been
        expressed in clearer terms, a full and proper consideration  of  his
        decision, especially  at  [57]  and  [61]  to  [63],  discloses  the
        significance that he attached to the extent of  the  delay  and  the
        consequences wrought by the delay on the  relevant  public  interest
        factors. In these circumstances it cannot be said that the  FtJ  has
        misunderstood or  miss-applied  the  principles  established  in  EB
        (Kosovo).

    14. Despite not making any explicit reference to  the  term  "compelling
        circumstances" or the authority of SSHD v SS (Congo)  &  Ors  [2015]
        EWCA Civ 387  it  is  readily  apparent  from  the  judgement,  when
        holistically considered, that the FtJ regarded  the  delay  of  many
        years as  constituting  a  "compelling  circumstance".  This  was  a
        conclusion that the FtJ was rationally entitled to reach. In looking
        beyond the immigration rules  the  FtJ  has  taken  account  of  all
        relevant considerations, including those identified in section 117B.
        The FtJ was aware that the respondent had no right to remain in  the
        UK from 2011 [63] but was nevertheless entitled to conclude that  he
        had established a significant private life with his friends, family,
        through his employment and his relationship with his British citizen
        partner (who earned in excess of �18,600), and that the  significant
        delay  was   sufficient   to   render   the   decision   to   remove
        disproportionate. Whilst this may be a generous conclusion it is not
        one that was reached by an unlawful route, by misdirection  of  law,
        or by failure to consider relevant factors. Nor was  it  a  decision
        that was perverse.

    15. In the circumstances I am satisfied that the  FtJ  did  not  make  a
        material error in law.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal did not make a  material  error.  The  Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed.
