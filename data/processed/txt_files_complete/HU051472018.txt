                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the determination of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Swinnerton promulgated on 5 October 2018 after a hearing
    at Hatton Cross on 27 September 2018.  The appeal arose  because  by  a
    decision that was made in February 2018 the Secretary of State  refused
    the application of Mr Nawab for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom based on long residence.  I shall refer to Mr  Nawab  as
    'the appellant' as he was before the First-tier Tribunal.  The issue is
    a relatively short one to determine.  The  Secretary  of  State  relied
    upon a discrepancy in the accounts that the appellant had provided  for
    the purposes of the payment of tax to HMRC in which he  had  previously
    declared that he was earning or had earned  �10,392.   It  is  accepted
    that this was wrong and was wrong by a huge margin.  Indeed the correct
    figure was  something  in  the  region  of  �39,000  a  discrepancy  of
    something like �29,000.  It is the appellant's case that he was  simply
    careless and that it was in large measure, indeed perhaps entirely, the
    fault of his accountants who  prepared  accounts  which  the  appellant
    carelessly did not check and which he sanctioned by signing them but he
    did so in all innocence.  That in my judgment is an  entirely  fanciful
    submission to be making, looking at the scale of the  dishonesty  which
    was occurring here.

 2. First,  accountants  work  on  instructions  from  the  client.   Those
    instructions must contain written material, bank statements,  vouchers,
    invoices, receipts, fares and a whole measure of  documentary  evidence
    upon which an accountant would produce his figures.   It  may  be  that
    there will be some matters which he will  consider  and  attribute  to,
    perhaps, a  different  year  or  he  may  consider  that  some  may  be
    deductible from gross income and others not, but he works  on  material
    which is supplied by the appellant.   The   appellant  would  wish  the
    Tribunal to believe was that he provided all of the material  that  was
    necessary in order to produce his  accounts  showing  that  he  had  an
    income of something like �39,721 but, by some carelessness on the  part
    of the accountants (dishonesty is not alleged)  this  was  put  into  a
    drawer or marginalised or  disregarded  so  that,  notwithstanding  the
    clear evidence of income in the form of taxable income of �39,000,  the
    accountant somehow mismanaged what was happening and provided a  figure
    which was one quarter of the reality.  We have  not  got  the  material
    that the appellant supplied to his accountants or his instructions.  In
    many circumstances, accountants,  perhaps  conventionally,  return  the
    written material.  It is, of course, not their own material.  The  bank
    statements, vouchers, bills, receipts and invoices are all the property
    of the tax-payer and one would expect them to be returned, certainly if
    it were asked.  We do not have  therefore  an  insight  into  what  the
    instructions were that the accountants were provided with  such  as  to
    have created such an elemental error of misstating the  taxable  income
    so that it was only one quarter of the actual sum.

 3. Second, accountants owe a professional duty to a client not to  lie  or
    to be frank when they have made a mistake.  The appellant  relies  upon
    contact that he has had with his former accountant,  a  company  called
    Qadeer & Company, in which they wrote a letter dated 22 July  2018  for
    the benefit of the Tribunal where they say that  they  have  filed  the
    initial tax returns for the years 2010-11 and 2013-14 for the appellant
    and "there are some miscalculations identified and  rectified  with  HM
    Revenue & Customs by his new accountant."   They  may  well  be  saying
    that, because the error was an understatement which  expanded  from  an
    initial declared taxable income of �10,000 to one of �39,000, this  was
    something by way of a 'miscalculation'.  I do not  take  that  to  mean
    that they were saying that they were the ones at fault.  Indeed I would
    not  expect  them  to  say,  'Our  client  provided   us   with   wrong
    information.'  I would expect them to be as careful as they might be in
    trying to avoid declaring their client to be dishonest.  They  end  the
    letter by saying, 'We apologise for  any  inconvenience  caused  to  Mr
    Nawab  regarding  this.'   I  do  not  regard  this  an  admission,  as
    professional  persons,  that  they  were  in   dereliction   of   their
    professional duties and, if that  had  been  the  case,  I  would  have
    expected them to have said it perfectly plainly and I do not see it  in
    that letter.

 4. There is a  third  reason.   The  third  reason  is  that  there  is  a
    significant  difference  between   the   years   that   are   relevant.
    Inevitably, if the appellant had  been  doing  approximately  the  same
    amount of work as appears to have been the case from year 1 to year  2,
    then one would expect the earnings to be approximately the same.   That
    is not the case as far as this appellant is concerned.   He  must  have
    known his approximate earnings; that he was working the  days  that  he
    was working; the time that he was working; the amount of hours  he  was
    putting in; the contract sums that he was generating,  such  that  they
    could not conceivably have resulted in  an  income  of  �10,000.   That
    would have been an incredible bonus to somebody: to find, having worked
    long hours and received large sums of money, that the  accountants,  as
    if by some form of magic, could have reduced that  figure  to  �10,392.
    It is a fiction that it is the fault of the accountant. But it is  also
    a fiction that the appellant when confronted with tax  payable  on  the
    sum of �10,000 would not have known exactly  that  he  was  underpaying
    tax.

 5. One would expect the current  accountants  to  also  be  wise  to  what
    happened and they, too, have written a letter.  The letter is dated  17
    September 2018. Once again, it is addressed  for  the  benefit  of  the
    Tribunal.  It states that the  previous  accountant  had  declared  the
    total income incorrectly for the tax  years  2010-2011  and  2013-2014.
    'We informed our client about this and he instructed us immediately  to
    rectify the mistake.'  I do not read into the statement that  this  was
    the fault of the previous accountants.  The fact that the appellant has
    accepted  that  he  is  wrong  is  not  of  any  evidential  value   in
    establishing whether or not  he  was  acting  dishonestly.   It  merely
    indicates that, when confronted with the disparity (the  disparity,  of
    course, which benefited him for the purposes of  tax  but  was  not  so
    beneficial when it came to other purposes) he  was  bound  to  have  to
    accept he was wrong.

 6. It is also said that the fact that  HMRC  took  no  action,  except  to
    require payment, is a material factor.  For my part, that is  a  matter
    that one should properly take into  account  but  it  is  difficult  to
    speculate upon the reasons for a failure to take action on the part  of
    HMRC.  I am not even going to suggest what the number of reasons  might
    be because it is speculation.  However the  important  matter  to  take
    into account is that what HMRC decided to do is nothing to  the  point.
    It was for the First-tier Tribunal Judge to make of the  evidence  what
    he would and, in this  case,  the  Judge  had  before  him  this  stark
    difference between the figure which was subsequently selected as  being
    the accurate figure of �39,000 odd and the original figure  of  �10,000
    odd.  It was for him to determine whether that established  dishonesty.
    He accepted that there was a significant difference in  income  and  he
    found that the respondent was entitled, regardless of  the  appellant's
    return for the tax year ending April 2014, to have drawn  an  inference
    that the appellant had been  deceitful  and  dishonest.   It  begs  the
    question, therefore, as to what material there was  for  the  Judge  to
    find that this was carelessness and no more  than  carelessness  rather
    than dishonesty.

 7. He does so, at least in part, by reference  to  the  response  of  HMRC
    which appears to be his principal driving reason.   He  does  not  deal
    with the matters that I have  raised:  that  the  accountants  work  on
    instructions; that those instructions are  based  on  written  material
    provided by the appellant; that the appellant himself is provided  with
    a copy of the accounts when they are  prepared  and  signs  them;  that
    accountants have a professional duty to their client not to lie and  to
    be frank if they have made a significant (in  this  case  an  enormous)
    mistake.  The Judge does not deal with the large discrepancy (which  he
    acknowledges resulted in an under-charge running into several thousands
    of pounds).  Nor does he deal with the fact that an individual  (whilst
    he may not know the minutiae of his accounts and the  contents  of  his
    account) knows roughly the scale of his  earnings,  the  scale  of  his
    work, the scale of his receipts and the scale of the outgoings such  as
    to provide him with a very clear insight into the reality, were  he  to
    be presented with a tax assessment which is so  vastly  different  from
    the earnings he must have known he was generating during the course  of
    the year.

 8. It is said that this was a start-up business and  therefor  he  naively
    thought that he only earned �10,000.  I cannot see how the Judge  could
    have thought this.  It was a material consideration for him  to  assess
    separately whether or not the appellant could really  have  known  that
    the earnings were so much greater than he had  signed  off.   In  these
    circumstances, I simply do not accept the  submissions  made  that  the
    case-law supports this argument and that it was open to  the  Judge  to
    find carelessness.  It was, and is always, a requirement for a Judge to
    give adequate reasons why he considered that the appellant was careless
    and not dishonest.  For the reasons that I have provided,  I  am  quite
    satisfied that the reasoning of the Judge is wrong.   It  will  require
    the determination to be set aside and for the matter to be reconsidered
    and the decision re-made.
