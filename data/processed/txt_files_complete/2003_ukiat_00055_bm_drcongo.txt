                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr NS Ahluwalia (counsel instructed by Glazer Delmar) for the appellant
Miss K Evans for the respondent

   This is an appeal from a  decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  J  Bailey),
   sitting at  on 11 October 2002, dismissing an  asylum  and  human  rights
   appeal by a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC].  Leave
   was given on the basis that the adjudicator might not have

   a) dealt with part of the appellant's case; and
   b) taken a proper view of the psychological evidence about him.

2.    The part of the appellant's case which it was said had not been  dealt
   with was his claim to be at risk, independently of his experiences in the
   army, which  formed  the  main  plank  of  it,  because  of  his  uncle's
   association with the Union pour la D�mocratie et le Progr�s Social [UDPS]
   opposition party. His case on this point was that he had  not  taken  any
   active part in his uncle's,  or  the  UDPS's  activities:  in  fact  (see
   witness statement � 7) he had taken care to be out while they were  going
   on, in case he got into any trouble which might prejudice his studies. It
   followed that he never had got into any UDPS-related trouble  before  his
   call-up; but he did claim that he had been victimized while in  the  army
   because of his uncle.

3.    There is material in  the  background  evidence  which  suggests  that
   persons known to be associated with the UDPS may in some cases be at risk
   on return. It is by no means clear that counsel for the appellant  before
   the adjudicator (not Mr Ahluwalia) put this part of his case properly  to
   him. We are inclined to think not, because the adjudicator  did  deal  in
   some detail at � 11 with possible risk  to  the  appellant  as  a  failed
   asylum-seeker. However the only findings he made  on  this  part  of  the
   appellant's individual case were that he "He would not be a person wanted
   by or of any  interest  to  the  authorities  ...  he  does  not  have  a
   background in the DRC that will leave him at risk ...". The UDPS case did
   arise on the individual material before the adjudicator, and in  view  of
   the  background  evidence,  it  needed  to  be  dealt  with,  which   the
   adjudicator did not do.

4.    That being so, the obvious course, taking this point alone, seemed  to
   us to be to send the case back to the same adjudicator for  him  to  deal
   with it. Miss Evans agreed to that; but Mr Ahluwalia did not, because  of
   the  other  point  (b),  on  which  leave  had  also  been   given.   The
   adjudicator's conclusions on that are at � 9.2:

   As to the psychologist [sic] report, the conclusions of that  report  are
   based on self reporting by the Appellant.  As  I  found  the  Appellant's
   story to be a falsehood I can put little weight upon the report which has
   in my view been induced by manufactured statements by  the  Appellant  to
   the psychologist.

5. While the adjudicator would undoubtedly have  been  fully  justified,  if
   the appellant's story about  his  military  imprisonment  and  subsequent
   escape had stood alone, in regarding it as so floridly bizarre as  to  be
   quite incapable of belief, Mr Ahluwalia is equally right in saying  that,
   so far as his method is concerned, the adjudicator  effectively  put  the
   cart before the horse. If a report (psychological or psychiatric,  or  of
   any other kind) is put forward as capable of affecting  the  decision  on
   credibility, it makes no sense to reach  a  credibility  decision  before
   dealing with it, and then doing so on the basis  that  the  decision  has
   already been taken.

6. The weight to be given to such a report is quite  another  matter:  since
   the adjudicator had taken a wrong approach in dealing with this  one,  we
   told Mr Ahluwalia that we should consider its merits for ourselves,  with
   a view to seeing whether its conclusions really should have affected  the
   adjudicator's credibility decision. The report, dated 30 September  2002,
   is by Mr  C  McNulty  MSc:  his  professional  qualifications  are  as  a
   chartered  clinical  psychologist,  and   a   member   of   the   British
   Psychological  Society,  and  he   clearly   has   significant   clinical
   experience.

7. Mr McNulty's  findings  were  as  follows:  the  symptoms  the  appellant
   described were consistent with  moderate  clinical  depression  and  were
   consistent with the life-history he had given; their  onset  appeared  to
   coincide with his detention and  mistreatment.  He  also  displayed  some
   symptoms  consistent  with  a  degree  of  PTSD  [post-traumatic   stress
   disorder], also in the moderate range and consistent with his account  of
   mistreatment. The main conclusion drawn from those findings was that,  in
   the context of the appellant's fear of being killed on return, his mental
   state would get much worse if he were refused asylum, and he  might  harm
   himself. That assumed that the appellant really did have a fear  of  that
   kind; but the findings themselves are capable of being relevant  to  that
   question, if only because they are put forward  as  consistent  with  the
   history he gave.

8. As has often been said, the essential feature  of  any  piece  of  expert
   evidence is that it should  provide  the  tribunal  with  some  means  of
   assessing  its  reliability,  rather  than  simply  stating  the  giver's
   qualifications and inviting whatever he says to be  taken  on  trust.  Mr
   McNulty does  this  to  an  extent  in  giving  his  conclusions  on  the
   appellant's  cognitive  ability,  for  which  he  had  used  the   Ravens
   Progressive Coloured Matrices (RPCM). He gives  a  general  view  of  the
   test's purpose and merits, then concludes

   On this occasion [the appellant] made only three errors. This performance
   is consistent with that which would be predicted of a person of at  least
   low  average  cognitive  ability  (IQ)  and  is  not  indicative  of  any
   significant level of mental impairment.

   While it would have been better to explain what  mistakes  the  appellant
   had made, that does provide some sort of score on a recognized test,  and
   relate it to the normal range.

9. When it comes  to  the  appellant's  depressive  symptoms,  there  is  no
   reference to any test at all: yet, as all who  are  familiar  with  these
   cases are aware, they do exist. The  PTSD  symptoms  are  described  with
   reference to the DSM-IV criteria, which are attached to the  report;  yet
   there has been no attempt to relate each feature to any of  the  detailed
   heads of the criteria, let alone to give any score on each, or to  relate
   the result to the normal range. It is quite impossible as  a  result  for
   the appellate authorities to reach any independent conclusion as  to  the
   validity of Mr McNulty's conclusions, so far as they were based  (as  the
   adjudicator pointed out) on information related by the appellant himself.

10. Mr Ahluwalia did suggest  that  these  were  sufficiently  based  on  Mr
   McNulty's own clinical observations. He cited what Mr McNulty said  about
   the appellant appearing to suffer from increased levels  of  irritability
   and tearfulness.  If  that  comment  stood  by  itself,  there  might  be
   something to be said for this point; but in fact it comes  right  in  the
   middle of the appellant's own history of his symptoms. The only  part  of
   Mr McNulty's account of the interview between them  which  clearly  stems
   from his own observations, rather than what the appellant  told  him,  is
   the first paragraph:

   In interview [the appellant] seemed to be trying his best  to  answer  my
   questions accurately and he was very cooperative. He appeared to have  no
   difficulty in following the translation, which was in his native Lingala.

11. The result is that we do not  consider  that  Mr  McNulty's  report,  if
   given its proper weight in the right place, ought to  have  affected  the
   adjudicator's credibility findings. We are  conscious  that  adjudicators
   are very often faced with such evidence. In our view they  simply  cannot
   be expected to spend the time on it in each case which we have  done.  It
   is settled law that fact-finders (whether juries or professional  judges)
   do not need, and should not be required to hear expert  evidence  on  the
   credibility of a witness whose relevant characteristics fall  within  the
   normal range. In our view, unless a consultant psychiatrist  or  clinical
   psychologist is able to give detailed and objectively verifiable  reasons
   for regarding the appellant as outside the normal range, and explain  how
   far outside the normal he is, then adjudicators should not be required to
   take their evidence into account in reaching their credibility decision.

12.  Whether  that  is  right  or  wrong,  it  is  quite  clear   that   the
   adjudicator's credibility decision on this  appellant's  history  in  and
   after escaping from the army must stand. On his  claim,  with  which  the
   adjudicator has not dealt, to have been associated, if only as  a  family
   member and while in the army,  with  his  uncle's  political  activities,
   different considerations may arise. It will be  for  the  adjudicator  to
   deal with that on the facts, and to take a view on  the  consequences  on
   the background evidence of whatever findings he makes. For  that  purpose
   only, we make the direction below.
