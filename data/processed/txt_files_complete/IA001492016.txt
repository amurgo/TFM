                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Woolf who, in a determination promulgated on 24
    May 2017, dismissed the appellant's appeal against a  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to grant her  leave  to  remain  on  human
    rights grounds.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of the Ukraine, born on 27  March  1958  who
    appealed against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State  made  on  21
    December 2015 to refuse her application for leave to remain outside the
    Immigration Rules.  The appeal was dealt with on the  papers  by  Judge
    Woolf.  Judge Woolf noted  the  appellant's  immigration  history:  the
    appellant had been the recipient of a number of visit visas  commencing
    in March 2000 culminating in the grant of a visa which was  valid  from
    23 August 2006 to 23 August 2007.  A further application  for  a  visit
    visa dated 24 September 2007 had been  refused  as  the  appellant  had
    overstayed her previous leave.  That  decision  was  appealed  and  the
    appeal was allowed but the  visa  was  not  issued  as  the  respondent
    discovered that the appellant had accessed NHS treatment to  which  she
    was not entitled.    The appellant was refused a visa in December 2007.
    The appellant had also applied for a visit visa  in  Cyprus  under  the
    name of Valentyna Shcherbyna which was refused  because  when  she  was
    fingerprinted it was discovered she had previously been refused under a
    different name.  The appellant admitted entering Britain  illegally  in
    2008.

3.   When she made the application for  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
    grounds the appellant had submitted  a  report  from  a  consultant  in
    clinical oncology dated 1 July 2015 outlining her medical  history  and
    treatment.  This indicated that she had  been  treated  for  metastatic
    liposarcoma which had been treated  by  excision  and  radiotherapy  in
    2002, for breast cancer in 2003 and a further cancer in 2009, and  that
    a benign tumour had been excised in 2013.   A  consultant  stated  that
    three of the cancers which had been indicated were capable of relapsing
    and causing further disability.  Although  the  appellant  was  not  in
    active treatment at the time she  remained  under  active  surveillance
    with three monthly reviews and regular CT scanning.

4.   The refusal of the Secretary of State referred to the decision in  N  v
    UK [2008] ECtHR asserting that in that judgment it  was  observed  that
    the court had never found  a  proposed  removal  of  an  alien  from  a
    contracting state to give rise to a violation of Article 3  on  grounds
    of the applicant's ill-health.  The Secretary of State noted  that  the
    appellant's son was in Britain and it was considered that the appellant
    would be able to maintain contact with him from the Ukraine.

5.   In paragraphs 9 onwards the judge sets out further  evidence  from  the
    appellant  which  included  statements  from  her  and  her  son.   The
    appellant said that she had come to Britain in 2000 to give her son the
    best possible education and that he had attended an independent  school
    in Eastbourne while she studied English here.  She had rented a private
    house and had fully supported him.  They then moved to  Brighton  where
    they had been residing since.  Her son had studied at the University of
    Sussex.  It appears that the appellant owns a home in Brighton  without
    a mortgage.  There was further evidence relating to the various cancers
    which  the  appellant  had  suffered  as  well  as  evidence  that  the
    appellant's son had opened his own catering business in Brighton  after
    graduating from university.  The appellant stated she had no  relatives
    or friends left in Ukraine and that all her friends were here and  were
    willing to help her.  Her son stated that  he  had  received  permanent
    residence in 2011 and that his mother had  paid  for  his  tuition  and
    living costs and devoted her entire life to him.  He  referred  to  the
    fact that her left leg had been amputated and at that time she had been
    fully dependent on his support.  He stated that she  feared  loneliness
    and had concerns about being abandoned and rejected by him. They  lived
    together and had no recourse to state benefits as he owned a successful
    restaurant business in Brighton.

6.   The judge noted a letter  dated  6  March  2008  from  the  appellant's
    representatives which referred to the refusal of  the  visit  visa  and
    stated that:

         "The issue with failing to disclose that the passport she submitted
         in 2008 with her application was  stated  at  the  counter  at  the
         British Embassy post when she was questioned".  She apologised  for
         not  completing  the  section  on  the  application  form  and  had
         apologised at the earliest possible opportunity."

    It was said that her  failure  to  disclose  her  previous  immigration
    status was not deliberate.  Moreover, with regard to her surname it was
    stated that had used a previous surname than that  which  was  used  in
    other applications and that her name was changed officially in  Ukraine
    and an original document of that change had been issued.  It was stated
    that the application  which  had  then  been  refused  under  paragraph
    320(7A) had not resulted from deliberate act on her part.


7.   The judge set out her findings of fact and  conclusions  in  paragraphs
    25 onwards of the determination.  She noted that it appeared  the  case
    that a claim in the grounds of appeal before her that  the  appellant's
    Article 3 rights would be infringed was an  error.   The  judge  stated
    clearly that no Article 3 claim could succeed.  It was conceded by  the
    appellant's representatives that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The  judge  accepted  that  the
    appellant had acquired a private life in Britain and that at some  time
    she had entered in 2008 and remained here illegally  ever  since.   She
    pointed out that between 2000 and 2008 the appellant only had leave  to
    enter and to remain as a visitor for short periods and that she did not
    deny having overstayed and, moreover, the judge said that she  did  not
    accept  for  a  moment  the   assertion   made   in   the   appellant's
    representative's letter that the appellant did not  knowingly  seek  to
    deceive the respondent in the application she made for entry  clearance
    just prior to her unlawful entry.  The judge stated that  she  accepted
    that the appellant might have changed her name but it  was  clear  that
    she did not  disclose  on  her  application  form  anything  about  her
    previous refusals.  The judge said it was not remotely  plausible  that
    this was not deliberate.

8.   Moreover,  the judge went on to state that  she  noted  that  when  the
    appellant had last arrived in Britain in undisclosed circumstances  and
    remained unlawfully it was a time when her son had been resident in the
    UK for eight years and had yet  to  qualify  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain.  She pointed out therefore that the appellant's son had applied
    for indefinite leave to remain when he knew that his mother was  living
    with him and had no lawful leave to remain.

9.   In paragraph 28 of the determination the judge stated that:

         "Given the degree to which the appellant has indulged  in  previous
         deception of the immigration authorities in the UK I am not  minded
         to accept as necessarily credible any bare assertion she makes that
         is not adequately supported by evidence.  I appreciate that  it  is
         difficult to prove a negative, however her claim that  she  has  no
         relatives or friends in Ukraine falls to be assessed in that light.
          Whilst the appellant claims to be entirely  financially  dependent
         on her son and he claims  that  he  runs  a  successful  restaurant
         business in Brighton, no evidence of his financial  resources,  his
         income or profit, savings or any other assets have been  disclosed.
         I accept that she owns a flat in Brighton in which both she and her
         son live.  The only  other  evidence  of  her  financial  resources
         consists of bank statements.  The latest of those appear to  relate
         to something described as a 'tracker  bond  eighteen  month'  which
         shows a balance of �10,127.63 as at 7 April 2015."

    With regard to her  son's  current  account  the  judge  said  that  he
    appeared to have an overdrawn balance of �350.27 on 19 June 2015.


10.  The judge accepted that the appellant enjoyed private life  in  the  UK
    and that she was  emotionally  dependent  on  her  son  and  that  some
    physical  dependency  could  not  fail  to  arise  in  light   of   her
    disabilities.  The  inference  was  of  sufficient  gravity  so  as  to
    potentially engage the respondent's obligations under Article 8 of  the
    ECHR.

11.  The judge  went  on  to  consider  whether  or  not  the  decision  was
    proportionate.  She referred to the provisions in Sections 117A  and  B
    of the 2002 Act.  She said that the appellant had not demonstrated that
    she was financially independent and that although she claimed financial
    dependency on her  son  neither  her  son's  resources  nor  hers  were
    satisfactorily evidenced.  She was not satisfied that there was  not  a
    prospect that the appellant would be a burden on public funds were  she
    allowed to remain in the United Kingdom.  The judge went on to say:-

         "Her position in the UK has at all  times  been  precarious;  those
         periods of leave she enjoyed as a visitor were finite and her  last
         entry was clearly unlawful and she has had no leave to remain since
         2008.  She has not demonstrated that she would not receive adequate
         care and monitoring of her  various  health  problems  in  Ukraine.
         When the consequences for the appellant and  her  son  are  weighed
         with public interests it is my judgment that the public interest in
         removing  illegal  entrants  and  enforcing  immigration   controls
         outweighs those individual considerations that  the  appellant  has
         prayed in aid.  What has to be understood is that my  consideration
         has to be based on the obligations owed  by  the  respondent  under
         international treaties.


         Whilst  the  appellant's  circumstances  cannot  fail   to   arouse
         compassion given the degree to which she  has  suffered  from  very
         serious health problems it is not apparent from the evidence before
         me that they cannot be adequately addressed were she to  return  to
         Ukraine.  I  accept  it  is  emotionally  difficult  for  both  the
         appellant and her son to be separated  from  each  other  and  that
         difficult choices may have to be made by the appellant's son as  to
         his continuing to live in the UK  in  order  to  benefit  from  his
         indefinite leave to remain in the UK and to run  a  business  here.
         There is an option open to the appellant in that she may apply  for
         entry clearance as his dependent relative.  The evidence before  me
         does not however show that she meets the requirements of the  Rules
         relating to such a category.  There is no reason in my judgment why
         she  should  gain  the  benefit  of  her  unlawful  entry  in   not
         demonstrating that those requirements of the Immigration Rules were
         met.  To afford her that advantage over other potential  candidates
         for entry would undermine  the  proper  management  of  immigration
         control."

    For those reasons the judge dismissed the appeal.

12.  The grounds of appeal stated that the judge had erred by  finding  that
    the appellant had had no regard at all for the immigration laws of this
    country and said  that  it  was  clear  by  making  an  application  to
    regularise her stay in the United Kingdom and to wait over one year for
    her appeal showed that she did have regard to the immigration laws.  It
    was stated there was clear evidence from the refusal  letter  that  the
    appellant had never had recourse to public funds and that she owned her
    own home and had more than adequate funds to enable her to live in  the
    United Kingdom without recourse to public funds.  It was further argued
    that  the  appellant  paid  privately  for   medical   treatment   thus
    contributing to the UK economy.

13.  Ms Norman argued that the judge  had  erred  in  her  consideration  of
    Section 117B and was wrong to refer to deception in paragraph 28 of the
    determination.  There had been a lengthy covering letter  referring  to
    the visit refusal.  She pointed  out  that  no  point  had  been  taken
    regarding the provisions of paragraph 322 of the Rules or  any  general
    rules of refusal  and  therefore  there  was  nothing  to  warrant  the
    conclusions of the judge or any other higher consideration.  It was not
    said in the refusal letter that the Secretary of State did not  believe
    the appellant's assertions and  no  point  had  be  taken  against  her
    regarding such deception.  No difficulties had  been  raised  regarding
    the appellant's visits between 2000 and 2007.  She also argued that the
    judge had erred when considering the issue of Section 117B and  private
    funds: those provisions extended to private life rather than to  family
    life.  She argued, moreover,  that the judge had erred by stating  that
    the appellant had used public funds when there was  clear  evidence  in
    the bundle that she had paid privately for her cancer treatment here.

14.  In reply, Mr Wilding pointed out that the  appellant  had  produced  no
    evidence that she had not used national health treatment prior to  2007
    and argued that the judge was correct  to  find  that  the  appellant's
    private life  was  precarious.   He  pointed  out  that  the  appellant
    admitted that she had entered illegally.

15.  Ms Norman, in reply,  argued that the judge  had  raised  issues  which
    had not been highlighted by the Secretary of State,  particularly  that
    relating to deception and again argued that  the  appellant's  position
    should not be considered to be precarious as the appellant  was  basing
    her claim on family rather than private life.  Mr Wilding at this stage
    referred to the decision in AM (Section 117B) Malawi [2015]  UKUT  0260
    which indicated that when considering the issue of whether  or  not  an
    appellant's residence here was  precarious  there  was  no  distinction
    between private and family life.

16.  I consider that there is no material error of law in the  determination
    of the judge.  The reality is that she was fully entitled to find  that
    the appellant had exercised deception when she had last entered Britain
    in 2008 and to place weight on the fact that the appellant had lived in
    Britain without leave to remain  for  seven  years  before  making  the
    application.  I consider that the  judge  was  entitled  to  take  into
    account the fact that the appellant had changed her  name  and  used  a
    different name when making a visa application and had not  been  candid
    about  refusals  of  visa  applications  when  she  had  made   further
    applications for visit  visas  and  was  therefore  not  someone  whose
    assertions could be trusted.  That conclusion was entirely open to  the
    judge on the evidence before her, particularly given that the appellant
    had entered illegally.   Moreover the judge did properly  consider  the
    financial evidence and was fully entitled to come to the view that this
    appellant, although she may not have used public funds to  date,  might
    well be in a position where she would do so in the future.  I would add
    that the reality is that although it appears  that  the  appellant  has
    paid for medical treatment since 2007 there is nothing to indicate that
    she had done so when she first entered Britain and indeed  that  was  a
    reason why she had been refused a visit  visa.   The  refusal  on  that
    ground does not appear to have been challenged.

17.  The judge was, in my view, not unsympathetic to the position  in  which
    the appellant has found herself but she was fully entitled to  come  to
    the conclusion that the interference with the appellant's  family  life
    was fully proportionate.  She was clearly right to place weight on  the
    appellant's deception and the length of period she  had  lived  without
    leave.  I also consider that  the  immigration  status  of  an  illegal
    entrant, which is what this appellant is,  must  be  considered  to  be
    precarious  irrespective  of   the   argument   that   the   issue   of
    precariousness as set out in Section 117B is related  only  to  private
    life.  For these reasons I find there is no material error  of  law  in
    the determination of the Judge and I dismiss this appeal.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
