Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr S. Hussain, Solicitor, of Mitchell & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A. Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants are  citizens  of  Pakistan,  born  respectively  on  27
    December 1967 and 1 January 1948.   They  are  son  and  mother.   They
    applied for entry clearance as visitors to see the  sponsor,  Mr  Zafar
    Mehmood, who is the son of the second  appellant  and  brother  of  the
    first appellant.  Their applications were refused by the respondent  on
    9 September 2012.

2.   The  appellants  appealed  against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, where their appeal was heard on  2  May  2013  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Britton.  He dismissed  the  appellants'  appeals  in  a
    determination dated 16 May 2013.

3.   On 27 June 2013 permission to appeal  against  the  decision  of  Judge
    Britton was granted by the First-tier Tribunal.  The main matter  which
    appears to have troubled the granting judge was that the  sponsor  gave
    oral evidence, which contradicted certain written  statements  made  by
    the appellants.  The granting judge appeared to think that there was an
    arguable procedural unfairness in this regard.

4.   On 31 July 2013, Ms Holmes, for the  respondent,  conceded  that  there
    was an error of law in the  determination  of  Judge  Britton  on  this
    issue.  That concession strikes me as generous; nevertheless I  see  no
    legitimate reason to go behind it.  The position, accordingly, is  that
    I re-make the decision in these appeals.  In doing so, however, I  have
    treated Judge Britton's determination as a record of what was  said  to
    him at the hearing.  I indicated as much to the parties on 31 July.

5.   The second appellant was a  widow  living  on  a  pension.   The  first
    appellant described himself as an agriculturalist, who also derived  an
    income from hiring out an agricultural vehicle and a  car.   The  first
    appellant supplied the respondent with various pieces of  documentation
    concerning the vehicles and his land.  In particular, documents of July
    2012 showed payments in respect of a crop of  wheat.   There  was  also
    evidence showing that the appellant had a wife  and  four  children  to
    support.

6.    In  the  notice  of  decision,  the   respondent   stated   that   the
    documentation provided did not satisfy the respondent  that  the  first
    appellant received the income claimed from his land  and  vehicles.   A
    copy of the personal bank statement for the first appellant showed  two
    cash deposit payments in July 2012 totalling PKR  450,000  (�2,958.62),
    which was "almost 10 times your claimed  total  monthly  income".   The
    respondent was, accordingly, not satisfied that the first appellant had
    satisfactorily evidenced his circumstances.  The  respondent  was  also
    not satisfied that  the  first  appellant's  proposed  expenditure  was
    commensurate with his evidenced circumstances.  As a  result  of  these
    matters, the respondent was not satisfied that the first appellant  was
    genuinely seeking entry as a visitor, as required by  paragraph  41  of
    the Immigration Rules.   The  respondent  voiced  similar  concerns  in
    respect of the second appellant, given  that  their  applications  were
    joint ones.

7.   At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, the  sponsor,  who
    gave evidence with the assistance of an  interpreter,  is  recorded  as
    having stated that the first appellant would pay for the travel of  the
    first and second appellants to the United Kingdom but that the  sponsor
    would maintain them whilst in this country:

         "It was put to the sponsor that his brother  had  stated  that  his
         sponsor was going to pay for their travel.   The  sponsor  said  he
         will pay for his maintenance while he is in this country, not their
         travel.  He was not aware that his brother had stated that he,  the
         sponsor, was going to pay for their travel." [12]


8.   In his evidence to me, given with the  assistance  of  an  interpreter,
    the sponsor said that he  had  paid  for  the  travel  tickets  of  the
    appellant.  He had done so in  April  2013.   Asked,  therefore,  about
    paragraph [12] of the First-tier Tribunal's determination, the  sponsor
    said that "maybe I said something that was wrong."  He then  said  that
    it was possible he had not  understood.   The  sponsor  gave  no  clear
    answer to the question of whether it had always been the  intention  of
    the parties that he should pay for the travel costs of the  appellants.
    Asked why the appellants needed to have  travel  money  sent  from  the
    United Kingdom, the sponsor said that he went to  Pakistan  every  year
    and they would spend money on him and his family.  When it was  put  to
    the sponsor by Ms Holmes that he had been untruthful  about  who  would
    pay for the tickets, the sponsor replied that he  had  not  understood.
    He had given �1,500 in cash to a friend who had taken it  to  Pakistan,
    where it had been paid to an agent to buy tickets.  The sponsor  showed
    me documentation relating to this transaction.

9.   I have taken account of all the  evidence  in  this  case  and  of  the
    submissions made by Ms Holmes and Mr Hussain.  It is for the appellants
    to prove on the balance of probabilities that they  meet  the  relevant
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.  In the present case, the  issue
    is whether a genuine visit  is  intended  and  whether  the  appellants
    intend to return at the end of that visit.

10.  I fully appreciate the difficulties faced by somebody in  the  position
    of the first appellant, in establishing his economic  circumstances  in
    Pakistan.  It is clearly unrealistic in such a case to expect detailed,
    independent audited accounts showing family income and expenditure over
    a suitable period of time.   That  said,  however,  there  are  plainly
    difficulties with the evidence put forward by  the  appellants  in  the
    present case.  The second appellant is a widow of modest means, who  is
    now aged 65.  Her evidence does not  sufficiently  indicate  ties  with
    Pakistan, such as to lead her  to  return.   The  first  appellant,  by
    contrast, has a wife and four children.  That consideration is  one  to
    which I give weight.

11.  However, I do not in all the circumstances consider that  it  overrides
    the problematic features  of  the  first  appellant's  evidence.   Even
    making allowances for the matters I previously described, the  evidence
    regarding  his  economic  position  in   Pakistan   was   and   remains
    problematic.  The  large  payments  into  the  first  appellant's  bank
    account, which troubled the respondent, might relate to  the  sales  of
    wheat.  The position is,  however,  not  clear.   In  order  to  get  a
    coherent picture, evidence over a much longer period was needed,  which
    could show how the first appellant's  claimed  average  monthly  income
    derived from the sales of produce from his land,  as  well  as  rentals
    from his vehicles.

12.   Notwithstanding  all  this,  it  might  have  been  possible  to  make
    allowance for  the  various  evidential  deficiencies,  had  the  other
    evidence adduced in support  of  the  appellants  been  cogent.   That,
    however, is not the case.  As is already apparent, the evidence of  the
    sponsor is particularly problematic.  Other than vaguely  referring  to
    possible misunderstandings, he could not explain why he had  said  what
    is  recorded  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  at  [12]   of   the
    determination.  On the contrary, his evidence to me made what  he  said
    to the First-tier Judge  intensely  problematic.   It  frankly  beggars
    belief that the sponsor would not have said that he had  paid  for  the
    costs of travel if, as he told me, prior to the hearing in May 2013  he
    had sent a significant  sum  in  cash  to  Pakistan,  to  be  used  for
    precisely that purpose.  The  suggestion  that,  having  done  so,  the
    sponsor was then able to say that he was  not  going  to  pay  for  the
    travel is, frankly, unsatisfactory.  On a matter that could be  tested,
    the evidence adduced on behalf of the appellants  can  be  seen  to  be
    lacking in credibility.  Notwithstanding Mr  Hussain's  submissions,  I
    consider that this properly affects the  view  I  should  take  of  the
    documentary  evidence  relating  to  the  first  appellant's  financial
    circumstances in Pakistan.  There is, in short, no scope for giving any
    "benefit of the doubt" to the appellants, as regards that evidence.   I
    conclude that I have not been given a credible or coherent  account  of
    the  socio-economic  situation  of  the   appellants.    In   all   the
    circumstances, I conclude that they have  accordingly  failed  to  show
    that a genuine visit is intended and that they intend to return at  the
    end of that visit.

13.   I  note  that  the  sponsor  has  signed  what  he  describes  as   an
    undertaking, that he will be responsible for "all  the  required  costs
    for their deportation", should the appellants refuse to  leave  at  the
    end of their permitted time in the United Kingdom.  This  document  is,
    however, dated 2 October 2012,  and  thus  postdates  the  decision  in
    question.  By reason of section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and
    Asylum Act 2002 in a case  of  this  kind  I  may  consider  "only  the
    circumstances appertaining at the date of the decision".   Particularly
    in view of my findings regarding the sponsor, I am not satisfied it has
    been  shown  that  this  undertaking  relates  to  such  circumstances.
    Indeed, I regard that undertaking and what the sponsor said at the  end
    of the hearing, that he was prepared to "put my house as a  guarantee",
    as further examples of the sponsor's  propensity  to  say  anything  he
    thinks it might take in order to enable the appeals to succeed.

14.  For these reasons, I find that the appellants have not  discharged  the
    burden of showing that they meet the requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  This does not, however, mean that any applications  they  might
    make in the future are doomed to failure.   On  the  contrary,  if  the
    appellants are able to put forward satisfactory evidence regarding  the
    position of the first appellant, in terms of his income and  outgoings,
    a different result  might  ensue.   That  is  so,  notwithstanding  the
    negative findings I have made in respect of the sponsor.  Amongst other
    things, he told me that he had successfully  sponsored  three  or  four
    other people to visit the United Kingdom from Pakistan  and  that  each
    had returned.  No further details were given.  As a result, although  I
    give that evidence no significant weight in the context of the  present
    appeals, detailed evidence in the context of  any  future  applications
    may well be of material assistance to the appellants.

Decision

15.  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal has, by  concession,  been
    set aside for error of law.  I  accordingly  re-make  the  decision  as
    follows.  The appellants' appeals against the refusal decisions of  the
    respondent are dismissed.
