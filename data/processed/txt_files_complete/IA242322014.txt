Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representative and no appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Camp) allowing the appeal of Sashi Natesan,  a  citizen
    of India born on 11 February 1982, against a decision of the  Secretary
    of State refusing to grant him leave to remain as a  Tier  5  Temporary
    Worker  (Creative  and  Sporting)  Migrant  under  para  245ZR  of  the
    Immigration Rules (Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC 395 as
    amended) on 27 May 2014 and also to make a decision to  remove  him  by
    way of directions under s.47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality
    Acts 2006.

 2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as  they  appeared  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant's immigration history is as follows.  On 2 May  2013,  he
    was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a Tier 5 (Creative and
    Sporting) Migrant valid until 3 February 2014.  On 14 February 2014  he
    was granted leave to remain in the UK on that same basis  until  2  May
    2014.  On 30 April 2014, he made a  combined  application  for  further
    leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 5 Temporary  Worker  (Creative  and
    Sporting) Migrant and for a Biometric Residence Permit.

 4. On 27 May 2014,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  that  application.
    Although the Secretary of State was satisfied that  the  appellant  met
    the  relevant  requirements  for  Attributes  in  Appendix  A  and  for
    Maintenance in Appendix C and awarded  him  the  required  points,  the
    Secretary of State refused him leave on the basis that:

         "Grants of Entry Clearance of Leave to Remain in the  Creative  and
         Sporting sub-category of Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) are limited to a
         maximum continuous  period  of  12  months,  as  specified  in  the
         Immigration Rules.

         In view of the fact you have previously been granted 12  months  of
         leave in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Secretary  of  State  is  not
         satisfied that a further period of leave to remain in this category
         can be granted."

 5. The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
    determined by  Judge  Camp  on  the  papers  as  no  oral  hearing  was
    requested.  Having set out the  requirements  of  para  245ZR  and,  in
    particular, sub-paragraph (b), Judge  Camp  concluded  that  there  was
    nothing in para 245ZR(b) which restricted the grant of entry  clearance
    or leave to a maximum continuous period of twelve months.   Judge  Camp
    also referred to para 245ZR(f) which allowed for the grant of a maximum
    of 24 months in total to a Tier 5 applicant in the "creative" category.
     Judge Camp concluded that it was not clear whether the applicant  fell
    within the "creative" or "sporting" category and concluded at paras 18-
    20 of his determination as follows:

         "18. There is nothing in the  refusal  letter  or  in  any  of  the
             respondent's documents which shows whether the appellant is in
             the creative, rather than sporting, category.  This in itself,
             renders it impossible to determine whether the correct rule or
             rules have been applied.  The outcome would  be  different  in
             each case.

         19.  Inadequate reasons have therefore been given for the decision.

         20.  I consequently allow the appeal on the basis that the decision
             is not in accordance with the law,  in  order  to  enable  the
             respondent to give proper consideration to the application."

 6. On 26 September 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Chambers)  granted
    the Secretary of State permission to appeal.   The  grounds  of  appeal
    argue that it was clear from the appellant's application that  he  fell
    within the "sporting" category as he was seeking employment as a  "work
    - rider/groom".  Consequently, by virtue of para 245ZR(b)(ii)(1) he was
    limited to a total of twelve months' leave and therefore the  Secretary
    of State's decision not to grant the appellant  further  leave  was  in
    accordance with the Rules as the appellant  had  already  been  granted
    twelve months' leave.

 7. The appellant is unrepresented and did  not  attend  the  hearing.   Mr
    Richards, who  represented  the  Secretary  of  State,  invited  me  to
    determine the appeal in the absence of the appellant.  I confirmed  the
    address of the appellant on the Tribunal's file was the address held by
    the Home Office.  Notice of the hearing was sent to  the  appellant  at
    that address on  24  October  2014.   In  those  circumstances,  I  was
    satisfied that the appellant had been notified of the hearing  or  that
    reasonable steps had been taken to notify him of it and that it was  in
    the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing in the exercise of
    my discretion under rule 38 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended).

 8. Mr Richards relied upon the grounds of appeal and  submitted  that  the
    appellant fell within para 245ZR(b)(ii)(1) and  as  a  consequence  any
    grant of leave was restricted  to  a  maximum  of  twelve  months.   He
    submitted that the judge had erred in law in allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal and he invited me to  set  it  aside  and  remake  the  decision
    dismissing the appellant's appeal under the Rules.

 9. Paragraph 245ZR sets out the period and  conditions  of  any  grant  of
    leave to an individual seeking to remain in the UK, inter  alia,  as  a
    Tier 5 (Temporary Worker) Migrant.  So  far  as  relevant,  para  245ZR
    provides as follows:

         "(a) If any calculation of period of  leave  comes  to  zero  or  a
             negative number, leave to remain will be refused.

         (b)  Subject to paragraphs (c) to (f) below, leave to  remain  will
             be granted for:

             (i)  the length of the period of engagement,  as  recorded  in
                  the Certificate of  Sponsorship  Checking  Service  entry,
                  plus 14 days (or,  where  the  applicant  has  consecutive
                  engagements, a period beginning on the first  day  of  the
                  first period of engagement and ending 14  days  after  the
                  last day of the last period of engagement) or

             (ii) the difference between the period that the applicant  has
                  already spent in the UK since  his  last  grant  of  entry
                  clearance or leave to enter as a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker)
                  Migrant and:

                  (1)  12 months, if he is being sponsored in the Government
                      Authorised   exchange   sub-category   for   a   Work
                      Experience Programme where the initial grant of leave
                      was granted under the Rules in  place  from  6  April
                      2012, the Creative and Sporting sub-category, or  the
                      Charity Workers sub-category, or

                           ...

             whichever of (i) or (ii) is the shorter."

10. Summarising those provisions, the length of leave to be granted is  the
    shorter of the two periods calculated under sub-paragraph (i) and (ii).



11. Sub-paragraph (i) calculates the period of leave to be granted as  that
    specified in the Certificate  of  Sponsorship  as  the  length  of  the
    engagement to be undertaken by an individual plus fourteen days.   That
    certificate is not contained  within  the  bundle  of  papers  although
    reference  is  made  to  a  gross  annual  salary  of  ï¿½17,500  in  the
    appellant's application for leave.  It may well, therefore,  have  been
    an application where leave was sought for twelve months.  In  fact,  it
    is not material to the outcome of the appellant's  appeal  whether  his
    application was for twelve months or less.  This is  because  he  falls
    within para 245ZR(b)(ii)(1) and the effect of that applied  to  him  is
    that he is only entitled to a maximum of twelve  months  as  a  Tier  5
    (Temporary Worker) Migrant falling in the "Creative and  Sporting  sub-
    category".  He was, therefore, by virtue of that provision, entitled to
    leave calculated as the difference between twelve months and the period
    he had "already spent in the UK since his last grant of entry clearance
    or leave to enter" as a Tier 5 Migrant.  The appellant was last granted
    leave to enter (as opposed to leave to remain) on 2 May 2013.  He  had,
    by the date of his application, been in the UK for twelve  months  with
    leave until 2 May 2014.   The  difference,  therefore,  between  twelve
    months and the period he had already been in the UK since he  was  last
    granted entry clearance or leave to enter was, in fact, zero.  He  was,
    therefore, not entitled to the grant of  further  leave  as  a  Tier  5
    (Temporary Worker).

12. The judge referred to para 245ZR(f) which he noted allowed a  "creative
    worker" under the Tier 5 route to be granted a maximum  of  24  months'
    leave with the same sponsor.

13. It is not entirely clear whether  the  judge  had  in  his  papers  the
    appellant's application.  However, it is clear  from  that  application
    that the appellant was not applying in the "creative" worker  category.
    At section L43 the appellant stated that his  job  title  was  "work  -
    rider/groom".  The job clearly fell within the "sporting" category.  As
    a result para 245ZR(f) had no application.  The appellant's application
    was governed by para 245ZR(b) and, in particular, sub-paragraph (ii)(1)
    and as a result the appellant was not entitled to the grant of leave of
    any further.  He had already been granted  the  maximum  leave  he  was
    entitled to.

14. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in allowing the
    appellant's appeal.  The appellant could not succeed under  para  245ZR
    and the Secretary of State's decision to refuse his application was  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules.

15. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the First-tier and  I  remake
    the decision dismissing the appellant's appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

                                                                      Signed



                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal

I have dismissed the appellant's appeal and for that reason I do not make  a
    fee award.
