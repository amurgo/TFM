                                                                   Claimants

Representation:

For the claimants:     Mr C Boyle, instructed by Halliday Reeves
For the appellant:     Ms H Rackstraw, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, Mashida Bibi, date of  birth  2.8.80,  and  her  claimed
    adopted children, Emerby Bakwanamaha Yambuya, date  of  birth  19.5.96,
    Salnody Kakule Yambuya, date  of  birth  20.5.00,  and  Patricia  Bouwe
    Lisasaya Yambuya, date of birth 7.6.03, are DRC nationals.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Caswell,  who  allowed  the  claimants'
    appeals against the decisions of  the  respondent,  dated  21.3.13  and
    7.11.13,  to  refuse  their  applications  made  on  9.3.13  for  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom for family reunion under paragraph 352A
    of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 5.3.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Cheales  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.4.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.5.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Caswell should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal may be summarised as follows. The
    first claimant sought family reunion with her  spouse,  Joachim  Afongo
    Yambuya, who was granted limited leave to remain in the UK as a refugee
    on 16.8.11. It is  claimed  that  they  were  married  in  a  customary
    marriage on 5.8.06. Her application was considered under paragraph 352A
    of the Immigration Rules  but  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied on the limited evidence that  the  claimant  was  married  as
    claimed, or that a marriage took place before the sponsor left his home
    country.

 7. The other claimants are alleged to be the  children  of  the  sponsor's
    brother and to have been adopted by the sponsor and the first claimant.
    It is alleged that the family rejected their mother, when she was found
    to be pregnant by another  man,  and  their  father  developed  serious
    mental illness so that he could no longer look after the claimants. The
    first claimant and the sponsor in the DRC then looked after  the  three
    claimants, until the sponsor fled the DRC in 2009.  Their  applications
    were considered under paragraph 352D and 319X of the Immigration Rules,
    the first being as the child of a parent with limited leave  to  remain
    as a refugee and the second being as  the  child  of  a  relative  with
    limited leave to remain as a  refugee.  However,  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer noted that 352D does not apply to de  facto  adopted  children.
    Further, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    relationship between these claimants and the sponsor was as claimed.  A
    supplementary refusal decision dated 11.11.13 did not accept  submitted
    adoption papers and noted that in any event the adoption would  not  be
    recognised in the UK.

 8. Judge Caswell accepted the sponsor's evidence as credible  and  reached
    the conclusion that he and the first claimant were validly  married  as
    claimed and that their marriage subsists with each of them intending to
    live with the other. In the circumstances, the judge found that all the
    requirements of paragraph 352A were made out in her case.

 9. It appears to have been conceded at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    that the three child claimants  could  not  meet  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 319X of the Immigration Rules. The judge also found that  the
    claimants failed to demonstrate that the formal  or  alternatively  de-
    facto adoptions by the sponsor and the first claimant is recognised  in
    the UK.

10. However, having found that the  child  claimants  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM in relation to family life, the judge  went
    on to conclude that there were arguably good grounds for  going  on  to
    consider article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules  on  the  basis  that
    there were compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  under
    the Rules. The judge then applied the Razgar  steps.  Contrary  to  the
    submissions of the Secretary of State's representative, the judge found
    on the evidence of the sponsor that he and the first claimant had  been
    an effective family unit since 2005 and thus family life which would be
    interfered with if not granted entry clearance. Taking into account the
    best interests of the children, the judge reached the  conclusion  that
    the  decision  was  unlawful  as  being  incompatible  with  the  child
    claimants'  Convention  rights.  The  judge  thus  allowed  the   first
    claimant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and  that  of  the  child
    claimants on human rights grounds.

11. The grounds of application for permission to appeal  first  argue  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed to  provide  adequate  reasons
    for finding that the sponsor and the first claimant are  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting  marriage  and  intend  to  live  together  permanently.
    Secondly, it is submitted  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  law  in  its
    approach to article 8. It is asserted that the judge failed  to  comply
    with MF (Nigeria) and Gulshan, to the effect that the Immigration Rules
    are a complete code and article 8 ECHR outside  the  Immigratoin  Rules
    should only be considered  if  there  are  arguably  good  grounds  for
    finding  that  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
    recognised in the Rules  which,  exceptionally,  justify  granting  the
    application outside the Immigration  Rules  because  the  result  would
    otherwise be unjustifiably harsh.

12. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Cheales noted, "In her  grounds
    for onward appeal, the respondent asserts that the judge failed to give
    reasons or adequate reasons for findings on material  matters  and  has
    erred in law in her approach to the Article 8 assessment,  taking  into
    account the guidance in MF (Nigeria)  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192,  Gulshan
    [2013] UKUT 00640 and Nagre [2013] EWCA 720. It is  arguable  that  the
    judge  has  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  in  her  findings   on
    proportionality,  taking  into  account  the  best  interest   of   the
    children."

13. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was no error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    decision should be set aside and remade.

14. I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge gave clear and cogent reasons
    for finding that the claimant and the sponsor  are  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting marriage and intend to live  together  permanently.  As  the
    judge stated at �12 credibility was at the core of the appeal.  Between
    �12 and �17 the judge set out her reasons. The sponsor was found to  be
    credible. The judge accepted evidence of  contact,  financial  support,
    and reasons for absence of documents. It is highly significant that  on
    his first arrival in the UK he gave the name and date of birth  of  his
    wife, which is the same as that of the first claimant.  The  conclusion
    reached was one which the judge was entitled to come having  been  able
    to assess the sponsor's oral evidence and credibility. I find no  error
    of law in this regard.

15. In relation to the child claimants,  the  judge  found  that  they  had
    failed to demonstrate that adoption, whether legal in DRC  or  de-facto
    adoption, is recognised in the UK so  as  to  qualify  under  paragraph
    352D. The judge also found that they failed to meet the requirements of
    Appendix FM.

16. Accepting that the child claimants did not meet the requirements of the
    Rules, Mr Boyle relied on the authority of AA (Somalia)  (FC)  v  Entry
    Clearance Officer (Addis Ababa) [2013] UKSC 81, where the Supreme Court
    reached the conclusion that whilst a de-facto adoption is  not  covered
    by the definition of parent within 352D, as  the  adoption  has  to  be
    recognised in the UK, the Immigration Rules were not exhaustive of  the
    UK's obligations under international law. In  that  case  AA  had  been
    allowed entry under article 8 ECHR and much of the debate was about the
    lesser rights in comparison to someone qualifying under  352D.  At  �24
    Lord Carnwarth accepted that it appeared harsh that under the Rules the
    de-facto adopted child was treated less favourably.

17. The judge was directed to Gulshan and invited to consider whether there
    were here compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  in  the
    Immigration Rules to as to justify a consideration of  article  8  ECHR
    outside the Immigration Rules. At �22 the  judge  noted  factors  which
    mitigated against the claimants. However, between �23 and �26 the judge
    set out her reasons for reaching the  conclusion  that  the  claimants'
    circumstances were compelling. In doing so, the judge reached views  on
    the submitted documents and the sponsor's  credibility  which  she  was
    entitled to and for which she has given cogent reasons.

18. Ms Rackstraw submitted that the judge had  not  analysed  the  evidence
    carefully enough and should have paid more attention to other or absent
    evidence. It was suggested that the judge's reasons were  'flimsy'  and
    her findings brief.

19. It is not necessary for the judge  to  set  out  every  part  of  every
    finding of fact, provided it is clear that  a  careful  assessment  has
    been made of the evidence and a conclusion reached which is within  the
    margin of appreciation open to the judge, i.e. a conclusion  which  she
    was entitled to reach on the evidence and for  which  the  reasons  are
    clearly set out. Much of Ms  Rackstraw's  submissions  centred  on  the
    argument that the concerns of the Entry Clearance  Officer  were  grave
    and that there was a risk of child trafficking, in respect of which the
    judge had not given adequate consideration or weight. However, based in
    large part as it was on a finding as to the credibility of the sponsor,
    much of the criticism  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  is  in  reality  a
    disagreement with the findings of the  judge.  I  also  note  that  the
    sponsor was found credible in his asylum claim, which also  touched  on
    his family circumstances.

20. In all the circumstances, I find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge was
    entitled to reach the conclusion that there were on the facts  of  this
    case compelling circumstances justifying  consideration  of  article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules. In undertaking  that  exercise,  and  in
    particular the proportionality balancing exercise between  on  the  one
    hand the legitimate aim of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  protect  the
    economic well-being of the UK through immigration control  and  on  the
    other the right to respect for private and family life, the  judge  has
    set out the factors taken into account and reached a decision  which  I
    am satisfied she was entitled to make and for which cogent reasons have
    been given.

Conclusion & Decision:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeals remain allowed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


















Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee has been paid in this case.
