Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss A Jones, instructed by Connaughts Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 6th April  1994  and  he
    appeals against  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Walker
    promulgated on 17th May 2018 refusing his appeal against  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State given on 6th December 2016.  The Secretary of
    State's decision was to refuse the application of a  family  permit  to
    join Miss Sara Alexandra Duarte de Almeida in the United Kingdom as her
    reported brother-in-law under Regulation 8 of the Immigration (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  The  application  was  made  on  24th
    November 2016.




 2. The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  appellant  and
    sponsor were related as claimed because the appellant submitted a NADRA
    Family Registration Certificate issued on 9th July  2015,  over  twenty
    years after the appellant and his brother were born.  Although the  DNA
    test showed he  was  related,  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that Muhammad Usman was the person who provided the DNA,  nor
    was the Entry  Clearance  Officer  satisfied  that  the  appellant  had
    provided his DNA to be tested.


 3. Further, the Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  the  appellant
    was wholly or mainly financially dependent on his sponsor or if he was,
    the Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied this  was  dependency  of
    necessity rather than choice.  The judge made findings considering that
    the appellant's evidence that he had  a  close  relationship  with  his
    sister-in-law was exaggerated as they had never met  and  secondly  the
    appellant's claim to be completely dependent upon his sister-in-law and
    to need her help and support was a further exaggeration.   The  sponsor
    and her husband had given conflicting evidence as to what the appellant
    was studying in Pakistan and how long he had been studying.




 4. At the hearing before First-tier Tribunal Walker, the sponsor stated in
    evidence that she was supporting the appellant in the  sum  of  �200  a
    month; her husband estimated payments between �150 and  �200  a  month.
    The  schedule  produced  from  the  money  transfer  receipts  in   the
    appellant's bundle showed a total transfer of �3,807.40 since May 2015,
    an average of �106 per month [17].




 5. The judge found the appellant and his parents lived in Faisalabad in  a
    rented property which cost about �95 a month [18].  The evidence of the
    appellant and sponsor was the parents contributed little  to  the  rent
    and that the major part of the  sponsor's  financial  contribution  was
    taken up by that rent.  Thus,  all  three  were  beneficiaries  of  the
    payments.




 6. The judge accepted that funds were being sent by the  sponsor  and  her
    husband to the appellant and his parents, but these payments  were  for
    the benefit of all three and not just the appellant.




 7. The judge did not accept the appellant was 'wholly maintained'  by  the
    sponsor.  At paragraph 22 the judge stated that the payments were  made
    but this did not amount to any degree of dependency.

 8. The appellant had not shown, 'whatever limited dependency  there  is  a
    dependency of necessity'.  The appeal was therefore dismissed under the
    2016 Regulations.




 9. In the application for permission to appeal it was contended  that  the
    judge appeared to accept the appellant and his sponsor were related  as
    claimed but there was no finding  as  to  that  fact  although  it  was
    assumed throughout the determination.




10. The judge erred in two materials ways:




      i) first, he applied the wrong test as to whether  the  appellant  was
         dependent and used the  phrase  'wholly  dependent'  which  was  an
         error;

     ii) the judge considered whether  the  appellant  was  a  dependant  of
         necessity as opposed to by choice but was irrelevant.




11. It was submitted that the judge had applied the wrong test.




12. There was no  definition  of  dependency  within  the  EEA  Regulations
    themselves.  The case of Le Bon ECJ case 316/85 stated.



         "the status of dependent member of a worker's  family  ...  is  the
         result of a factual situation, namely the provision of  support  by
         the worker, without there being any need to determine  the  reasons
         for recourse to the worker's support".




13. The judge erred in law by concluding that  financial  support  provided
    for the benefit of three people did not render the appellant  dependent
    within the meaning of Regulation 8, the amount sent to  the  family  in
    Pakistan having been worked out as �106 a month covered the  rent  plus
    an additional sum.




14. The judge erred in concluding that paying for the cost of accommodation
    and further support could not bring a person within the  definition  of
    dependency.  The case of Rahman in the Court of Justice of the European
    Union set out the financial support, showed dependency.  The  applicant
    did not need to be dependent on the EEA national to meet all or most of
    their essential needs.




15. The Home Office policy guidance set out that half of income being  from
    a sponsor and half from a pension would represent dependency.




16. At the hearing before me Miss Jones relied on her  written  grounds  of
    application.  She submitted that the judge had applied the wrong test.




17. Mr Melvin accepted in response that there was no Rule 24  but  asserted
    that the judge had considered all the evidence.  At paragraphs  15,  16
    and 17 it was clear he  had  not  accepted  the  closeness  as  claimed
    between the sister-in-law and the appellant.  The dependency was  shown
    in relation to the parents not the appellant.




18. The judge made adequate findings and the 2006  Regulations  and  policy
    were not relevant.  There was a blanket  disbelief  of  the  levels  of
    dependency and the judge found an exaggeration.  This was an attempt to
    reargue the case.  Mr Melvin  submitted  that  there  were  however  no
    findings on the fact of whether the appellant was related  as  claimed,
    although it appeared that DNA evidence was given, and the  relationship
    had been accepted at  the  hearing  and  thus  the  appeal  before  the
    Tribunal and dependency was the only issue under contention.  Mr Melvin
    submitted that should there be an error of law the matter should be re-
    heard de novo.




19. In conclusion I note the judge at paragraphs 21 to 23 said this,



         "21.     I accept that these funds are being sent  by  the  sponsor
             and her husband to the appellant and his parents in  Pakistan,
             but that these payments are for the benefit of all of them and
             not just the appellant.  The claim that has been made that all
             of the funds of the appellant is selective and  not  credible.
             The major part of the payments are taken up by rent and  which
             is the benefit of all.  If the  appellant's  parents  are  too
             old, infirm and penniless as claimed, then I would expect them
             to be the main recipients of any financial assistance".




         22.      I do not accept that the appellant is wholly maintained by
             the sponsor.  He no doubt  benefits  to  some  extent  by  the
             payments that are made but this does not amount to any  degree
             of dependency.




         23.      Neither has the  appellant  shown  that  whatever  limited
             dependency there is a dependency of necessity.  There has been
             no evidence of him working or being incapable of  working  and
             earning".




20. In Lim v Entry Clearance  Officer  Manila  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  1383,  at
    paragraph 32 the test was set out as follows:-




         "In my judgment, the critical question is whether the  claimant  is
         in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,  and  Reyes  now
         makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view. That is a simple  matter
         of fact. If he can support himself, there is no dependency, even if
         he is given financial material support by  the  EU  citizen.  Those
         additional resources are not necessary to enable him  to  meet  his
         basic needs. If, on the other hand, he cannot support himself  from
         his own resources, the court will not ask why  that  is  the  case,
         save perhaps where there is an abuse of rights. The  fact  that  he
         chooses not to get a job and become self-supporting is  irrelevant.
         It follows that on the facts of this case, there was no dependency.
         The appellant had the funds to support herself. She was financially
         independent and did not  need  the  additional  resources  for  the
         purpose of meeting her basic needs.




21. Thus, the critical question is whether in fact the  claimant  is  in  a
    position to support himself or not.




22. It would appear that the evidence given was that the  appellant  was  a
    student and as stated in Lim, the fact that he chooses not to get a job
    and becomes self-supporting is irrelevant.   The  judge  dismissed  the
    appeal on the basis that there were payments for the benefit of all  of
    the recipients not just the appellant, but this does not  preclude  the
    dependency of the appellant.  Specifically, the  judge  stated,  "there
    has been no evidence of him working or being incapable of  working  and
    earning".  The appellant does not have to be wholly maintained  by  the
    sponsor, the relevant test is whether the resources  are  necessary  to
    enable him to meet his basic needs.




23. The fact that the judge applied the wrong test fundamentally undermines
    his approach to the making of a factual finding.




24. Further, the fact that the DNA evidence was said to have been given and
    the relationship accepted, was nowhere recorded in the determination.


25. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.




26. As such, I set aside this decision in its  totality  and  remit  it  to
    First-tier Tribunal for re-hearing.

No anonymity direction is made.
