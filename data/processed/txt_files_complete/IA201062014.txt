                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Ms D Revill, instructed by Yemets Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Igor Ulitin, date of  birth  29.9.50,  is  a  citizen  of
    Russia.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Afako promulgated 29.1.15, allowing, on human
    rights grounds only, his appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary
    of State to refuse his application for an EEA Permanent Residence  Card
    based on a derivative right of residence pursuant  to  regulation  15A.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 2.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.3.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 4.8.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. The grant of permission to appeal was made on the  basis  that  it  was
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge erred in law in considering
    Article 8 ECHR when the Secretary  of  State  had  not  issued  removal
    directions.

 6. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was such error of law
    in the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    decision of Judge Afako must be set aside. As both parties agreed  that
    there was no need for further evidence the decision could be remade  by
    the  Upper  Tribunal  without  further  hearing,  consistent  with  the
    standard directions issued by the Principle Resident Judge.

 7. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    claimant is married to Ljudmilla Ulitma, an Estonian citizen. They came
    to live in the UK in 2000. Their child, born  in  1989,  is  a  British
    citizen, naturalised in 2012. The sponsor does not work but spends  her
    time looking after their child, who has a range of  significant  health
    and developmental conditions, and is in receipt of carer's allowance.

 8. Judge Afako found that the claimant is  not  entitled  to  a  permanent
    residence card, because the sponsor is not exercising Treaty rights  in
    the UK, as accepted by the claimant's representative  at  the  hearing.
    However, Judge Afako found that the claimant met  the  requirements  of
    regulation 15A(4A), because he played a primary care role in  the  life
    of his dependent child and that without the claimant, his wife and  son
    would not be able to cope and thus necessitate their departure from the
    UK in order to continue to enjoy family life. That decision was flawed;
    the judge did not address the correct question. The test is not whether
    they would be able to continue to enjoy family life,  but  whether  the
    child would be unable to reside in the UK or in another  EEA  State  if
    the claimant were required to leave the UK. The child would  have  been
    able to continue to live in the UK as his mother  is  not  required  to
    leave. Further, they will also be able  to  live  in  Estonia,  an  EEA
    state. It follows that the judge was in error to conclude at  �13  that
    the claimant had established a derivative right of residence in the  UK
    on the basis of the Zambrano principle.

 9. However, this error is not material to the outcome of  the  appeal,  as
    the judge went on to find that  the  claimant  is  not  entitled  to  a
    permanent residence card, as  a  person  with  a  derivative  right  of
    residence cannot acquire such status in the UK.

10. However, the judge was in error both in stating at �16 that the part of
    the decision stating that the claimant must make arrangements to  leave
    the UK must be set aside, as the claimant is not in fact entitled to  a
    derivative right of residence. Further, the judge was also in error  to
    go on to consider Article  8  ECHR,  when  there  was  no  section  120
    statement and no removal decision. As recently held in Amirteymour  and
    others (EEA appeals; human rights) [2015] UKUT 00466 (IAC),  "Where  no
    notice under section 120 of the 2002 Act has been served and  where  no
    EEA decision to remove has been made, an appellant cannot bring a Human
    Rights challenge to removal in an appeal  under  the  EEA  Regulations.
    Neither the factual matrix nor the reasoning  in  JM  (Liberia)  [2006]
    EWCA Civ 1402 has any application to appeals of this nature."

11. Similarly, in the Court of Appeal in FK (Kenya) v SSHD [2010] EWCA  Civ
    1302, Lord Justice Sullivan observed,

         "Question (iii): family life. Before dealing with this  question  I
         would observe that it is very doubtful whether it  was  appropriate
         for the Article 8 issues raised  by  the  appellant  to  have  been
         resolved at this stage when there had been no removal decision.  If
         and when a removal decision is made the appellant will be  able  to
         appeal against that decision and as part of that appeal he will  be
         able to include Article 8 grounds in his appeal. It will of  course
         be for the Secretary of State  to  decide  whether  to  deport  the
         appellant as a  person  who  has  committed  criminal  offences  or
         whether he should be removed under the Immigration Rules.  It  will
         be for the Tribunal at the stage  of  any  appeal  against  such  a
         decision to weigh the relevant factors as they exist at that  time.
         It seems to me therefore that it was  at  best  premature  for  the
         Tribunal to be asked to  consider  the  Article  8  issue  in  this
         appeal."

12. As at the date of  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    claimant was not compelled to leave the  UK  and  thus  the  Convention
    should not have been a consideration. The application for  a  residence
    card is in effect  a  request  to  recognise  an  existing  right.  The
    decision does not in fact change the claimant's status at all.  Article
    8 does not arise in these circumstances.

13. It follows that Judge Afako was in error  of  law  in  considering  and
    allowing the appeal on Article 8 ECHR.

14. It further follows from the above  that  the  claimant's  appeal  could
    never have succeeded and should have been dismissed.

15. In passing I note that �1 of the decision is in error in  stating  that
    there is no appeal under section 82 of the Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002,  as  no  immigration  decision  has  been  made.   However,   the
    regulations apply section 82 as if the  decision  were  an  immigration
    decision.

Conclusions & Decision:

16. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside and  remade  by
    dismissing the appeal.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of the claimant has been dismissed and  thus  there  can
be no fee award.
