respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:

      1. On 30 March 2016 the respondent made an order that the appellant is
         to be deported  from  the  United  Kingdom  ('UK'),  following  her
         criminal convictions as it was considered that her presence in  the
         UK was not conducive to the public good. The respondent refused the
         appellant's human rights claim in  a  decision  letter  dated  15th
         September 2016. On 15 November 2018 the decision was reviewed,  and
         the refusal of her claim was maintained  with  a  right  of  appeal
         under section 82 (1) of the 2002 Act.

      2. The appellant, a citizen of Jamaica, appealed this decision to  the
         First-tier Tribunal (Judge Rowlands) (hereinafter  referred  to  as
         the "FtTJ").  In a decision sent on 6th September  2019,  the  FtTJ
         allowed her appeal on human rights grounds, and  the  Secretary  of
         State has now appealed, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

      3. We make a direction  regarding  anonymity  under  Rule  14  of  the
         Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal  Rules)  Rules  2008  as  the
         proceedings relate to the circumstances  of  a  minor.  Unless  and
         until a Tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise  the  appellant  is
         granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings  shall  directly
         or  indirectly  identify  her  or  members  of  her  family.   This
         direction applies both to the  appellant  and  to  the  respondent.
         Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt  of
         court proceedings.

      4. For the purposes of this decision, we refer  to  the  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department as the respondent and to  SP  as  the
         appellant,  reflecting  their  positions  before   the   First-tier
         Tribunal.

Background:

      5. The appellant's immigration history is summarised in  the  decision
         of the FtTJ at paragraphs 1-3.  The  appellant  first  entered  the
         United Kingdom on 11 September 1991 was granted leave as a  visitor
         for six months.  She  remained  for  six  years  before  making  an
         application to remain based on her marriage to a British citizen in
         1996.

      6. On 4 May 2000 she withdrew that  application  which  had  not  been
         considered by then and made an application to  remain  indefinitely
         based on her relationship with  her  child  under  a  concessionary
         policy. Following further submissions, indefinite leave  to  remain
         was granted on 29 November 2000.

      7. Th appellant's offending history goes back to  1996  when  she  was
         first cautioned for an offence of theft. In 1998 she was  convicted
         of attempting to obtain property by deception and theft and in 2000
         she was again convicted  of  theft.  On  these  occasions  she  was
         ordered to pay a financial penalty.

      8. By 10 May 2002 she was convicted of offences theft and obtaining by
         deception and was made the subject of a community punishment  order
         requiring her to undertake a total of 60  hours  unpaid  work.   In
         2009 at the Crown Court she was convicted of two offences linked to
         unlawful benefit claims and  sentenced  to  9  months  imprisonment
         suspended for 18 months with a further unpaid work requirement  and
         a specified treatment requirement. In 2009  she  was  convicted  of
         theft and ordered to pay a financial penalty.

      9. In 2010 she  was  convicted  of  driving  whilst  disqualified  and
         without insurance and ordered to undertake 60 hours unpaid work and
         her driving licence was  endorsed  with  six  penalty  points.  The
         following year she was fined �65 for an offence  of  theft  and  in
         2012 for a similar offence, she was again made  the  subject  of  a
         community order requiring her to do unpaid work.

     10. In 2013 she was convicted of possession of a  controlled  drug  and
         theft and given a curfew for an unspecified period.

     11. In 2015 she was  again  made  the  subject  of  a  community  order
         requiring her to undertake a curfew for a specified period  with  a
         rehabilitation activity  requirement  for  the  offences  of  going
         equipped for theft and theft.

     12.  On  29  January  2016  she  was  convicted  of  entering  into  an
         arrangement to facilitate the acquisition, retention,  use  or  the
         control of criminal property and sentenced to  one  year  and  nine
         months imprisonment which was varied on  appeal  to  one  year  and
         three months prison imprisonment on 12  July  2016.  This  was  the
         offence which led to the deportation order being made.

     13. The circumstances of the offence are  set  out  in  the  sentencing
         remarks of the Judge and  summarised  in  the  decision  letter  at
         paragraph 20. The appellant was a co-defendant alongside others who
         had  been convicted by the jury of offences arising from  a  large,
         well-planned fraud involving large sums of money which  involved  a
         large number of  innocent members of  the  public  who   had  their
         confidential, financial and personal information stolen,  sold  and
         then misused and used to make  fraudulent  loan  applications.  The
         money lent by the lending company, Wonga, was then siphoned through
         numerous bank accounts in a large, well-organised  money-laundering
         operation.   In  SP's  case,  she  was  sentenced  based   on   her
         involvement with 35 accounts and from 21 of which took  money  from
         the fraud. A total of over �20,000 of which �19,000  was  withdrawn
         in cash. The judge found that  her  involvement  was  of  a  medium
         nature at category five and having considered  the  mitigation  and
         her previous offending  history  with  a  number  of  offences  for
         dishonesty, imposed an immediate custodial sentence  of  21  months
         (later reduced to 15 months).

     14. In light of her conviction, a decision to deport her was issued  on
         30 March 2016. This was responded to by the appellant  on  5  April
         2016 and further evidence submitted on 14 April  2016.  A  decision
         was made on 15 September 2016 to refuse a human  rights  claim  and
         this was certified under section 94B of the NIAA 2002.

     15. The respondent sought her removal from  the  UK,  but  the  removal
         directions were cancelled when on 4 November 2016  proceedings  for
         judicial review were issued. On 5 December  2016  she  was  refused
         permission to apply for judicial review.

     16. On 5 March 2017, an application  was  made  for  further  leave  to
         remain based on family and private life and a claim for asylum.  An
         asylum interview was conducted on 10 March 2017 but that claim  was
         later withdrawn.

     17. On 8 June 2016 further submissions were submitted and in July  2017
         she was  granted  bail  with  a  reporting  restriction.  Following
         further representations sent in September  2018  the  decision  was
         reviewed which resulted in the decision of 15 November  2018  which
         maintained the earlier decision to refuse her human rights claim.

The decision of the Secretary of State dated 15 November 2018

     18. The decision letter is a lengthy document extending to 26 pages. It
         is not necessary to set out all that letter and we shall  summarise
         the salient parts relevant to the issues raised by the parties.

     19.  Consideration was given to her family life with her three children
         born in the UK; JB and JK who were  over  18  years  and  were  not
         "qualifying children" for the purposes of paragraph 399 (a) of  the
         IR and J aged 15.

     20. It was accepted that she had  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with the children and that prior to her  imprisonment,
         her son was dependent on her physically and emotionally for his day-
         to-day care and well-being. However,  following  her  imprisonment,
         the care of her two sons was taken over by their  father  and  then
         her daughter.  It  was  confirmed  from  children's  services  that
         following her imprisonment, her husband assumed  the  care  of  the
         children and that an assessment was carried out which  stated  that
         the children were settled with their father although they  reported
         missing their mother during  the  assessment.  Further  information
         received noted that the father of the  children  did  not  wish  to
         continue to care for the children upon her  release  and  that  the
         younger children went to live with the appellant's  older  daughter
         and she looked after J. When granted  bail  on  24  July  2017  the
         appellant went to live at her daughter's home  with  her  sons  and
         children.

     21. In the decision letter, the respondent reached the conclusion  that
         it was not unduly harsh for J to live in Jamaica with  his  mother.
         The reasons given for that assessment was  that  whilst  he  was  a
         British citizen, there was no evidence to demonstrate that  he  was
         not also a  Jamaican  citizen  or  that  he  could  not  apply  for
         citizenship of that country.  As to his  educational  needs,  there
         was no evidence  adduced which would  indicate  that  it  would  be
         unduly harsh for him to attend school in Jamaica and that whilst it
         was noted he was at a critical point of preparing for his GCSEs and
         that relocation to Jamaica may cause a disruption to his education,
         no reasons had been given as  to  why  he  may  not  complete  them
         following which a decision could be made as  to  whether  he  could
         relocate to live in Jamaica or remain in the United Kingdom.  There
         was no expectation or obligation on him to relocate and  it  was  a
         matter for the appellant and her  daughter  to  decide  whether  it
         would be appropriate for him to accompany the appellant to  Jamaica
         or remain in the UK.

     22. The respondent accepted that the appellant was  currently  residing
         in her daughter's house with the children but that  the  assessment
         by Children's services showed that her daughter could  continue  to
         provide for J with financial support and that if the appellant  was
         deported, J would remain with  his  sister  and  she  would  obtain
         support from the extended family in the UK.

     23. The respondent concluded that it would not be unduly harsh  him  to
         remain in the UK without the appellant as he had been in  the  care
         of his adult sister since his mother's imprisonment  and  following
         release from prison and could remain with her in the event  of  his
         mother's deportation  J's sister had three children of her own  and
         there were no concerns in relation to them and she would be able to
         access local authority Children's services  for  assistance.  There
         was no reason why contact with  J  could  not  be  maintained  from
         abroad through the modern channels of communication.

     24. Consideration was given to J's best interests (at [60  -  66])  but
         the respondent reached the conclusion that there was no evidence to
         conclude that her presence was needed to prevent J from  being  ill
         -treated, or that his health  or  development  would  be  impaired.
         There was no evidence that deportation would result in J losing all
         contact with the appellant if deported.  Whilst  not  the  same  as
         remaining in the family home or  even  living  separately,  it  was
         considered that appellant could maintain contact with J  and  there
         was no evidence that J would be unable to visit her in Jamaica when
         old enough to do so. J would be able to stay in the United  Kingdom
         with his sister. The  respondent  took  into  account  the  medical
         evidence and J's health concerns due  to  sickle-cell  disease  but
         noted that his sister managed J's medical needs  adequately  during
         the appellant's absence.

     25. As to her private life, it was concluded  that  she  had  not  been
         lawfully resident for most of her life; she had lived in the UK for
         27 years but only lawfully resident for 18 years  and  four  months
         since her arrival in September 1991. As a result of  her  offending
         it was not accepted that the appellant was socially and  culturally
         integrated in the UK nor  that  there  would  be  very  significant
         obstacles to her reintegration to Jamaica- she  left  Jamaica  when
         aged  21  years  and  was  likely  to   have   established   social
         relationships there given her age upin entry to the UK.  There  was
         no evidence or reason why she  could  not  establish  a  family  or
         private life on return to Jamaica  notwithstanding  the  length  of
         time she spent in the UK and would be able to have support from her
         extended family members.

     26. As the exceptions  to  deportation  did  not  apply  in  her  case,
         consideration was given to  whether  there  were  "very  compelling
         circumstances" such that she should not be deported. The respondent
         set out that  there  was  a  significant  public  interest  in  her
         deportation because of her conviction and that the  nature  of  the
         offences suggested that she was unwilling or unable  to  support  a
         lifestyle in the UK without resulting to  criminal  activities  and
         there was insufficient evidence that she had  adequately  addressed
         all the reasons for offending behaviour. The  respondent  concluded
         that in the absence of evidence it was reasonable to conclude  that
         there remained a risk of the appellant reoffending should she  find
         herself in need of finances in the future and continuing to pose  a
         risk of harm to the public, or a section of the public (taking into
         account the annual fraud report).  There  was  no  indication  that
         wider family members depended on the appellant for their day-to-day
         health or well-being and that her removal would not impact  on  the
         wider family  members  or  interfere  with  any  family  life.  The
         respondent did not accept that her relationships with adult  family
         members  constituted "family life" for the purposes of Article 8 as
          the appellant had an older daughter who lived  independently  with
         her  own  two  children  and   whilst  she  provided  support,  the
         appellant lived independently of all the family  members  prior  to
         imprisonment. None of the private life claimed was of a significant
         or  very  compelling  nature  which  would  be  disrupted  by   the
         appellant's removal and  the  appellant  lived  in  United  Kingdom
         illegally for nine years and two  months  prior  to  being  granted
         indefinite leave to remain.

     27. At paragraphs 102-123 J's medical circumstances were considered  in
         the decision letter. Reference was made to the condition of  sickle
         cell anaemia, its symptoms and the treatment generally required. It
         noted that J's condition had been managed effectively in the United
         Kingdom and that there was no evidence available that  any  support
         provided would be unique or essential or could not be  provided  by
         other family members or healthcare professionals in the UK. It  was
         considered that J's sister would be able to guarantee his access to
         treatment and make decisions relating to treatment on his behalf.

     28. It was concluded that  there  was  no  expectation  that  J  should
         relocate to Jamaica but in the event  that  the  appellant  decided
         that it was in his best interests  to  accompany  her  to  Jamaica,
         healthcare for sickle-cell disease was available (  see  paragraphs
         111-123).

     29. Consideration was  given  to  the  appellant's  medical  issues  at
         paragraphs [124-154]. It was noted that the appellant had  provided
         evidence that she was diagnosed with mild depression and was  later
         prescribed  medication  but  that  no  further  evidence  had  been
         provided to confirm if she was  currently  on  any  medication  for
         medical issues. However, treatment was available for depression  in
         Jamaica and  that  the  condition  claimed  did  not  approach  the
         threshold for a breach of Article 3 or Article 8.

     30. In conclusion, the respondent considered that her deportation would
         not breach the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR and the
         public interest in deporting her outweighed her right to a  private
         and family life.




The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal:

     31. The appeal came before the FtTJ on 18th July 2019. The  FtTJ  heard
         oral evidence from the appellant, her son and  daughter  which  was
         summarised at paragraphs [4]-[12]. The FtTJ also had  a  bundle  of
         documentation  including  a  witness  statement  from  the   family
         members, including J, his  sister  and  brother,  medical  evidence
         relating to his condition and the report of an  independent  social
         worker.

     32. The FtTJ findings of fact and analysis of the issues are set out at
         paragraphs [19]-[27]. They can be summarised as follows:

          1) The  FtTJ  accepted  the  appellant's  nationality,  identity,
             immigration history and criminal history ([19]).

          2) As to her offending, the  FtTJ  was  not  satisfied  that  she
             accepted her wrongdoing. The judge found that  she  "seeks  to
             blame her circumstances for offending. As a single mother with
             a small child she seeks to justify  her  stealing,  there  are
             many people in similar circumstances who do not  get  involved
             in crime. She cannot blame her circumstances  and  poverty  on
             possession and misuse of drugs and certainly  not  on  driving
             whilst disqualified. She also blames friends were  influencing
             her, far from accepting her own  responsibility  she  actually
             blames others all the time."

          3) As to the appellant's view of the index offence, "she says  it
             was a bad relationship and at the tribunal hearing  she  still
             maintained that she didn't know what was going  on  despite  a
             jury convicting her and the judge's sentencing remarks. I have
             little confidence in her staying out of trouble and  can  well
             see how the respondent reached the conclusion that removal  is
             conducive to the public good. "[(at [20]).

          4) The FtTJ recorded that the appellant  expressed  concern  over
             her son's use of cannabis and that she was trying to bring  up
             her children responsibly. The judge concluded "I am  satisfied
             that if it was only her that I had to  consider  and  I  would
             absolutely reach the conclusion that her removal was conducive
             to public good and there was  no  reason  why  she  should  be
             allowed to stay in United Kingdom" (at [21]).

          5)  The FtTJ then considered the family life established  in  the
             UK and the circumstances of J and her relationship  with  him.
             The FtTJ directed himself to the relevant  law  and  paragraph
             399 (a) (at [23]). The FtTJ found that the eldest two children
             were not "qualifying children" as they were both over the  age
             of 18 and the only child qualified was J  who  the  judge  was
             satisfied was a British citizen and that the appellant  and  J
             had a genuine and subsisting relationship.

     33. When considering paragraph 399(b), the FtTJ reached the  conclusion
         that it would be unduly harsh for J to remain in the United Kingdom
         without the appellant, his mother. The reasons  are  summarised  at
         paragraph [25] where the FtTJ stated as follows:

             "25. There is absolutely no doubt the when she was  imprisoned
             other family members stood in to ensure that  J's  care  needs
             were met. His sister [X] bore the main burden of  doing  this,
             but she says it took its toll on her and that she could not do
             so again.  I doubt that she would leave J to fend for himself,
             but the  truth  is  that  J  found  the  experience  of  being
             separated from his mother tough and it had an  adverse  effect
             on his health  both  physical  and  mental.  This  is  clearly
             evidenced by all the witness statements in the report from the
             ISW. It is a shame that  his  mother  did  not  consider  this
             before getting involved in crime. Regardless of the fact  that
             they seem to cope when she was imprisoned in  the  past  I  am
             satisfied to the required standard bearing in mind all of  the
             evidence that is contained in the  documents  and  statements,
             that it would be unduly harsh for J to remain  in  the  United
             Kingdom without the appellant, his mother."

     34. At [26] the FtTJ considered the respondent's argument that J  could
         go with her to Jamaica. He stated:

             "26. I have been presented by the respondent with an  argument
             that it would be acceptable for J to go with her  to  Jamaica.
             Clearly, he is entitled to Jamaican citizenship and  there  is
             no legal barrier to him residing there. The appellant stresses
             that the respondent  has not  shown  detail  of  the  services
             available in Jamaica for children with  sickle  cell  disease,
             but this, of course, ignores the fact that the onus was on the
             appellant to show that it would be unduly harsh and  that  the
             services did not exist not the  respondent.  Nevertheless,  it
             seems the overwhelming view of the professionals is  that  his
             treatment would suffer by  his  removal  to  Jamaica  and  the
             interference of the treatment he now receives. I am  satisfied
             that it would be unduly harsh for him  to  return  to  Jamaica
             with her."

The Appeal before the Upper Tribunal:

     35. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal  that  decision
         and permission was granted by FtTJ O'Brien on 8  October  2019  for
         the following reasons:

             "The grounds assert that the  judge  erred  in  the  following
             ways.  The  judge  failed  to  give   adequate   reasons   why
             deportation will be unduly harsh on the appellant's son.

             The judge's reasons for finding undue harshness are set out at
             paragraph 25 and 26. They are brief and  arguably  inadequate.
             It is argued that the judge did not direct herself to the high
             threshold undue harshness, giving rise to a  further  arguable
             error of law. All grounds are arguable."

     36. The appellant was represented  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  Mr
         Hayward of Counsel. The Secretary of State was  represented  by  Mr
         Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer.

     37. We heard submissions from both parties. Mr Melvin, on behalf of the
         respondent relied upon the grounds and the skeleton argument  filed
         on the 12 December 2019 and did not seek to further elaborate  upon
         them.

     38. The points raised in the grounds and relied upon by  the  Secretary
         of State relate to the FtTJ's consideration of the issue  of  undue
         harshness and that the FtTJ had failed to  give  clear  and  cogent
         reasons as to how the high threshold of unduly  harsh  consequences
         were met in this appeal.  It was submitted that it was  unclear  on
         what basis the  threshold  was  met  at  paragraphs  25-26  of  the
         determination and whilst the FtTJ was not obliged to list  all  the
         evidence, he failed to give clear reasons as to why the appellant's
         son could not remain in the United Kingdom with relatives as he did
         while she was imprisoned or why  the  difference  in  treatment  in
         Jamaica if he was to accompany the appellant  would  not  meet  the
         required threshold.

     39. In the skeleton argument it was submitted by the Secretary of State
         that the FtTJ  failed  to  take  account  of  the  decision  in  PG
         (Jamaica) [2019] EWCA Civ 1213 at paragraph  [46]  which  reflected
         the high threshold and that the decision was on " all  fours"  with
         the present appeal. In conclusion, it  was  submitted  that  having
         recognised  that  the  appellant's  children  were   looked   after
         adequately by other family members  during  her  imprisonment,  the
         FtTJ did not have due regard for the high threshold as set  out  in
         the decision of KO (Nigeria) (appellant)v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department (respondent) [2018] UK 53,  and in PG (Jamaica)
          and had such  regard  been  had,  the  appellant  could  not  have
         succeeded before the Tribunal.

     40. Mr Hayward  relied  upon  his  Rule  24  response  filed  with  the
         Tribunal. He submitted that the grounds were in essence a  "reasons
         challenge" and did not seek to challenge  the  underlying  evidence
         that was before the FtTJ and that  there  was  sufficient  material
         before him to conclude that it would be unduly harsh for J to  live
         in Jamaica with his mother or for J to  remain  in  United  Kingdom
         without his mother.

     41. He submitted that it was not necessary to set out every  strand  of
         the evidence and that when looking at the decision as a  whole,  it
         was structured in such a way that it  demonstrated  that  the  FtTJ
         had regard to  all  of  the  evidence  that  was  before  him;  the
         submissions that were advanced  by  each  side  were  set  out  and
         summarised at [16]-[18] and he recorded that  reliance  was  placed
         upon the social work assessment and reports and that his  attention
         was drawn specifically to the ISW report on the effect  on  J  when
         his mother was detained which was significant in particular to  J's
         health (at [18]).  The FtTJ had correctly directed himself  in  law
         set out at [23] by reference to the relevant rule and  went  on  to
         apply them in his findings of fact and analysis at [24]-[27].

     42. In particular, at [26] the FtTJ considered the impact of separation
         between J and his  mother  and  considered  directly  the  previous
         impact of being separated from  his  mother  and  that  it  had  an
         adverse effect upon his health, both physically and  mentally,  and
         this was evidenced by the ISW report  and  the  witness  statements
         before him. He submitted that this went beyond  the  normal  impact
         upon a child being separated from a parent.

     43. As to the position in Jamaica, the FtTJ also considered the  impact
         upon J of residing there with his  mother.  The  FtTJ  acknowledged
         that he could live in Jamaica as he  had  the  ability  to  acquire
         citizenship but that the factor which outweighed that consideration
         was that of his health and treatment.

     44. In his submissions, Mr Haywood accepted that the reasoning set  out
         at paragraphs 25 - 26 was brief but submitted that when seen in the
         light of the evidence before the FtTJ, it supported the  assessment
         that the adverse effects would go beyond the normal impact  upon  a
         child when faced with the deportation of a parent.

     45. In his response, Mr Melvin submitted that  whilst  there  may  have
         been documentation before the FtTJ there were only vague references
         made to that evidence and that there was an absence of reasoning.

     46. At the end of the submissions we reserved our  decision,  which  we
         now provide with our reasons.

Discussion:

     47. We remind ourselves that we can only interfere with the decision of
         a judge if it has been demonstrated that there was an error of  law
         in reaching that decision.

     48. The effect of the provisions relating to the deportation of foreign
         criminals is that by Section 32(4) Parliament had decided that  the
         deportation of foreign criminals is conducive to the  public  good.
         By Section 32(5), the Secretary of  State  is  obliged  to  make  a
         deportation order subject to Section  33.   Section  33  identifies
         several exceptions, which if applicable, have the consequences that
         sub-Section 32(4) and (5) will not apply.

     49. On the present facts,  the  only  exception  relevant  was  whether
         removal would breach her rights and those  of  her  family  members
         under the ECHR.

     50. The Immigration Rules reflect the statutory  obligation  to  deport
         foreign criminals whilst recognising that there may be cases  where
         the making of  a  deportation  order  would  be  incompatible  with
         Article 8 (see Rules 398, 399 or 399A).

     51. The correct approach, where an appeal on human rights  grounds  has
         been brought in seeking  to  resist  deportation,  is  to  consider
         whether the appellant is a foreign criminal as defined  by  Section
         117D(2)(a), (b) or (c).  If so, does she fall within paragraphs 399
         or 399A of the Immigration Rules and if not, are  there  compelling
         circumstances over and beyond those falling within  paragraphs  399
         or 399A relied upon, such identification  to  be  informed  by  the
         seriousness of the criminality and taking into account the  factors
         in Section 117 A- C.

     52. On the facts of the case there is no dispute that the appellant was
         a foreign criminal; she was not a British citizen and by reason  of
         her offending history was properly characterised as someone who had
         been convicted of an offence of at  least  12  months  imprisonment
         that  and  therefore  in  accordance  with  paragraph  398  of  the
         Immigration Rules, the public  interest  required  her  deportation
         unless an exception to deportation applied.

     53. Thus, the issue before the FtTJ was whether she could  fall  within
         paragraphs 399 or 399A.  Paragraphs 399 and 399A of the Immigration
         Rules are reflected within section 117C (5) of the 2002 Act,  which
         provides as follows: -

             "Exception 2 applies where C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
             relationship with a  qualifying  partner,  or  a  genuine  and
             subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child,  and
             the effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be
             unduly harsh."

     54.  The question in s. 117C (5) as to  whether  "the  effect"  of  C's
         deportation would be "unduly harsh" is broken down into  two  parts
         in paragraph 399, so that it applies where:

             "(a) it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
             country to which the person is to be deported; and

             (b)  it would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the
             UK without the person who is to be deported."

     55. As set out at paragraphs [21] and [22] of KO (Nigeria) exceptions 1
         and 2 are "self-contained" and "leaves no room for further
         balancing".  In other words, a foreign criminal sentenced to less
         than four years who can meet the three requirements in exception 1
         or the requirements under Exception 2, is entitled to have his or
         her Article 8 appeal allowed.  There is no additional obligation to
         conduct a balancing exercise that attaches little weight to that
         appellant's private or family life in the UK or balances private
         life against the public interest, including the seriousness of the
         offending.

     56. Therefore, the judge was required to consider  what  was  meant  by
         "unduly harsh "in the context of the law  and  in  the  context  of
         specific factual circumstances of the Appellant and J (the relevant
         child).

     57. The grounds advanced on behalf of the respondent submitted that the
         FtTJ failed to give clear and cogent reasons as  to  how  the  high
         threshold of unduly harsh consequences was met in this  appeal  and
         that it is unclear  on  what  basis  the  threshold  was  met  when
         considering paragraphs 25-26 of his decision.

     58. We have given careful consideration to the decision of the FtTJ and
         have done so in the light of  the  material  that  was  before  the
         Tribunal.  In  our  judgement,  the  FtTJ  fully  appreciated   the
         applicable test that the appellant was required to satisfy to  meet
         the requirements of Exception 2. The  FtTJ  expressly  referred  to
         this at [23] and cited the relevant parts of paragraph  399  (which
         is replicated at S117C(5)), and  at  [24]  where  he  set  out  his
         conclusion that J was the only "qualifying child" by reason of  his
         British nationality and being satisfied that he had a  genuine  and
         subsisting parental relationship with his  mother.  The  FtTJ  then
         turned to the remaining subparagraph of 399 (a) (ii) and whether it
         would be unduly harsh for J to remain in the UK without his mother,
         who, at the date of the hearing was his primary carer.

     59. Whilst Mr Melvin relied upon the skeleton  argument  where  it  was
         argued that the  FtTJ  failed  to  have  due  regard  to  the  high
         threshold set out in the decision of  KO  (Nigeria)  (appellant)  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department (respondent)  [2018]  UK
         53, it is plain from the decision at  [18]  that  the  FtTJ  placed
         reliance on  the  skeleton  argument  produced  on  behalf  of  the
         appellant which he took into account when  reaching  his  decision.
         The skeleton argument before the FtTJ was a detailed document which
         set out the test in KO(Nigeria) at paragraph  [19]  and  identified
         each strand of the evidence by reference to  the  relevant  medical
         report, the report of the ISW and the witness  statements  and  how
         that evidence met the necessary threshold.

     60. The decision of KO (Nigeria) (appellant)v Secretary  of  State  for
         the Home Department (respondent) [2018] UK 53 considered  what  was
         the correct approach relating to what is meant  by  "unduly  harsh"
         within  the  context  of  the  legislation.  It   gave   particular
         consideration to paragraphs from the judgment of Laws LJ, with whom
         Vos and Hamblen LJ agreed, in MM (Uganda) v the  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA
         Civ 450 and the Upper Tribunal decision in MAB (USA)v  SSHD  [2015]
         UKUT 435.

     61. The decision of the Supreme Court which reaffirmed  the  definition
         of "unduly harsh" from the earlier  decisions  of  MK  and  MAB  at
         paragraph [33], stated as follows: -

             "Whether the  consequences  of  deportation  will  be  'unduly
             harsh' for an individual involves  more  than  'uncomfortable,
             inconvenient, undesirable, unwelcome or merely  difficult  and
             challenging' consequences  and  imposes  a  considerably  more
             elevated or higher threshold.

             The consequences for an individual will be 'harsh' if they are
             'severe' or 'bleak' and they will be 'unduly' so if  they  are
             'inordinately' or 'excessively' harsh taking into account  all
             of the circumstances of the  individual."   Although  I  would
             add, of course, that 'all of the  circumstances'  include  the
             criminal history of the person facing deportation."

     62. As the Supreme Court stated at paragraph 23, the expression "unduly
         harsh" is intended to  introduce  a  higher  hurdle  than  that  of
         "reasonableness" under section 117B  (6),  taking  account  of  the
         public interest in the deportation of foreign criminals.

     63. The Supreme Court further stated at paragraph 23 as follows: -

             "Further the word "unduly" implies an element  of  comparison.
             It assumes that there is a "due" level of "harshness", that is
             a level which may be acceptable or justifiable in the relevant
             context. "Unduly" implies something going beyond  that  level.
             The relevant context is that set by Section 117C (1), that  is
             the public interest in the deportation of  foreign  criminals.
             One is looking for a degree of  harshness  going  beyond  what
             would necessarily be involved for any  child  faced  with  the
             deportation of a parent. What it does not require in  my  view
             (and subject to the  discussion  of  the  cases  in  the  next
             section) is a balancing of relative levels of severity of  the
             parent's offence other than is  inherent  in  the  distinction
             drawn  by  the  section  itself  by  reference  to  length  of
             sentence."

     64. As set out  in  the  decision  of  The  Secretary  of  State  v  RA
         (S117C"unduly harsh", offence; seriousness) Iraq  [2019]  UKUT  123
         (IAC)  the President of the Upper Tribunal, Lane J  (sitting  in  a
         panel with UTJs Gill and Coker) considered the correct approach  to
         s. 117C(5)  with  the  benefit  of  the  guidance  provided  in  KO
         (Nigeria) v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 and NA (Pakistan). At paragraph 17,
         the following was stated:

             "17. As can be seen from paragraph 27  of  KO  (Nigeria),  the
             test of "unduly harsh" has a dual aspect. It is not enough  of
             the outcome to be "severe" or "bleak". Proper effect  must  be
             given to the adverb  "unduly".  The  position  is,  therefore,
             significantly far removed from the test  of  "reasonableness",
             as found in section 117B (6) (b)".

     65. Whilst there  is  no  express  reference  to  the  decision  of  KO
         (Nigeria), we are satisfied that the FtTJ was plainly aware of  the
         test that he was required to apply and whether there was  a  degree
         of harshness going beyond what would necessarily  be  involved  for
         any child faced with the deportation of a parent in his analysis at
         paragraphs 25-26. Whilst that analysis was brief, in our  judgement
         those paragraphs demonstrate that the necessary threshold test  was
         in fact applied.

     66. The FtTJ approached the task  by  recognising  that  it  was  child
         focused  rather  than  balancing  the  severity  of  the   offences
         committed and gave reasons, albeit briefly expressed, as to why the
         threshold was met by reference to the evidence.

     67. The FtTJ had recorded the submissions made on behalf of the parties
         and at [16]-[17] recorded those made by  the  respondent   that  it
         would not be unduly harsh for J to remain in  the  UK  without  his
         mother on the basis that when she  was  imprisoned  J's  day-to-day
         needs were met by other family members and that this could continue
         in the event of his mother's deportation.

     68. That submission was addressed at [25]  and  whilst  accepting  that
         other family members had "stood in" to ensure that J's  care  needs
         were met at that time, the FtTJ reached the conclusion on the  more
         up-to-date evidence that this would not be the  position  now.  The
         FtTJ referred to the evidence of  J's  sister  and  that  this  had
         "taken its toll on her" and that  she  was  therefore  not  in  the
         position to look after J in the event of his mother's  deportation.
         As the FtTJ stated, this was evidenced  in  the  witness  statement
         filed in behalf of J's sister and set out in the report of the  ISW
         (dated 25/5/19). The ISW report recorded the position of J's sister
         at paragraph 4.19 and that as a  result  caring  for  J  and  other
         siblings, she  was  at  the  point  of  "breakdown"  and  that  her
         assessment (which the  FtTJ  accepted)  was  that  she  had  become
         "burned-out". Contrary to the position of the respondent,  she  had
         not been able to provide all the necessary support for J as he  had
         failed three consecutive review appointments between November  2016
         - January 2017 leading to his hospitalisation  in  March  2017.  No
         other family relative was available from the  evidence  before  the
         FtTJ as J's father had had no contact with him all  the  family  in
         recent times.

     69. The FtTJ also gave a second reason is to  why  the  effect  of  the
         appellant's deportation upon J would be unduly harsh. This  related
         to the  adverse  effects  upon  his  health,  both  physically  and
         mentally, when previously separated from his mother (at [25]).

     70. In this respect, the FtTJ referred to the evidence before  him  and
         that  the  adverse  effects  upon  his  well-being  were   "clearly
         evidenced by all the witness statements and the report of the ISW".



     71. There was no challenge made to the medical evidence relevant to  J,
         which was set out in reports from the hospital, his medical records
         and summarised  in  the  ISW  report.  J  has  sickle-cell  anaemia
         (referred to as  "SCD")  which  is  a  chronic  haemolytic  disease
         resulting in anaemia progressive organ and vascular  damage,  which
         is punctuated by symptomatic and predictable and frequent crises of
         various types. The most  common  is  vaso-occlusive  crisis,  where
         there is crystallisation of haemoglobin within the red cells become
         deformed and obstructing the blood flow to an  area  of  the  body,
         causing severe pain, which may last for 7 to 10 days. This pain  is
         often sufficiently intense enough to require admission to hospital.
         The consequences are that the activities  of  daily  living  become
         limited or  disrupted  due  to  the  unpredictable  occurrences  of
         episodic pain which is known as a crisis. Thus,  the  condition  is
         complex and characterised by bouts of severe and occasionally life-
         threatening acute illness (crises) which increase susceptibility to
         infection, chronic fatigue, delayed growth and  progressive  tissue
         and organ damage. During these painful  incidences  the  individual
         requires assistance with managing their lives, eating, washing  and
         dressing. Due to the nature this condition this can  be  very  hard
         for sufferers to maintain steady education or  employment,  due  to
         the  unpredictable  nature  of  the  condition,  frequent  hospital
         attendances or managing of crises in the home.

     72. The reports refer to there being many triggers  for  a  sickle-cell
         crisis which include stress and that such a crisis may be "mild  or
         severe". The evidence recorded that J had several  admissions  into
         hospital due to various crises on 28 October 2016, 11 January 2017,
         5 March 2017 and 20 March 2017 and that it suggested  that  he  has
         had  a  severe  "phenotype  or  due  to  dramatic  social   changes
         experienced whilst his mother was incarcerated" (at [AB 49]).

     73. The ISW report made reference to the medical evidence and that  his
         condition was "reactive  to stress"  and " that as he was  immature
         in his development he required a  higher  level  of  parenting  and
         nurturing care than may ordinarily be expected for a child  of  his
         age" (at para. 4.25).

     74. Therefore, the adverse effects upon J were well documented and  the
         evidence was consistent in both the medical  reports,  the  letters
         from the school and the ISW report. J had suffered several episodes
         or crises which had coincided with the appellant's imprisonment and
         her subsequent immigration detention following  the  conclusion  of
         her  sentence.  The  medical  evidence  refers   to   the   medical
         professionals being fearful for his health due to  difficulties  in
         stabilising him. All of which demonstrated the impact  that  stress
         or change had  upon  his  medical  condition  (see  ISW  report  at
         par.4.25). The effects upon J were also recorded  in  the  evidence
         from  the  school  by  reference  to  his  presentation  in  school
         attendance and in the witness statements from  the  appellant,  J's
         sister and from J himself (see witness statement at [AB 137]).

     75. The FtTJ was entitled to place weight on that evidence and  in  our
         judgment the effect upon J  as  described  in  that  evidence  went
         significantly beyond the normal effects of separation  of  a  child
         from his primary carer.

     76. As to the alternative argument that it would not  be  unduly  harsh
         for J to live with his mother in Jamaica, the FtTJ  addressed  this
         at [26]. The  judge  acknowledged  the  argument  advanced  by  the
         respondent  that  J  was  entitled  to  Jamaican  citizenship   and
         correctly directed himself that the burden was on the appellant  to
         show that it would be unduly harsh but nonetheless  concluded  that
         the evidence of the professionals contained in the reports which he
          described as "overwhelming" was that his treatment would suffer by
         his removal and would interfere with  the  treatment  he  received.
         That evidence was contained in the medical reports  and  summarised
         in the ISW report and  referred  to  the  continuity  of  both  his
         healthcare  and  the  educational  provision,  both   critical   to
         maintaining stability in mental health  and  his  well-being.  When
         viewed alongside his British nationality, his  strong  family  ties
         with other family members including his siblings and that he was at
         a critical stage in his education, the conclusion  reached  by  the
         FtTJ that the effect upon J would be unduly harsh  if  required  to
         live in Jamaica with  his  mother,  was  one  that  was  adequately
         reasoned in accordance with that evidence.

     77. We would accept that the reasons given by the judge were  in  brief
         terms, but when viewed in the light of the evidence which the  FtTJ
         plainly accepted, we are satisfied that the reasons given were both
         adequate and sustainable.

     78. For those reasons, we are satisfied that the decision of  the  FtTJ
         did not involve the making of an  error  on  a  point  of  law.  We
         therefore dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
