For the Appellant:     Mr Hussain, instructed by Halliday Reeves, Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr Howells, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 25 June 1994 and is a female citizen of Iran.
    By  a  decision  dated  12  March  2018,  the  appellant  was   refused
    international protection by  the  Secretary  of  State.  The  appellant
    appealed to the First-tier tribunal which, in a decision promulgated on
    14 May 2018, dismissed the appeal.  The  appellant  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal  on  the  ground
    that it was arguable that 'the judge had failed to have adequate regard
    to or provide adequate reasons for his finding that the appellant would
    not be at risk as a failed asylum seeker [returning to  Iran]  pregnant
    and unmarried.'

 3. At the initial hearing at Bradford on 5 March  2019,  Mr  Howells,  who
    appeared for the Secretary of State, told me that it is he Secretary of
    State's view that the judge failed to carry out a thorough analysis  of
    risk on return, including consideration of those factors referred to in
    the grant of permission. He told me that the Secretary of State  agreed
    that the judge had erred in law such that his decision fell to  be  set
    aside. Moreover, since the First-tier Tribunal hearing,  the  appellant
    has given birth to a child (10 October 2018). The father is her British
    partner. The operation of section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act means that it
    is not in the public interest  for  this  appellant,  who  all  parties
    accept has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a  qualifying
    child, to be required to leave the United Kingdom.




Notice of Decision

 4. The decision of the First-tier tribunal which was promulgated on 14 May
    2018 is set aside. I have remade the decision. The  appellant's  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary of State dated 12 March  2018  is
    allowed on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR)


Signed                              Date 8 March 2019
