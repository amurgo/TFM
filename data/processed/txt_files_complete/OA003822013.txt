For the respondent: Mr S Kandola

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal, by the , against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal (Judge Kareena Maciel), sitting at  Newport  on  2  September
      2013, to  a husband appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, born in 1978.

   2. The judge  naturally  followed  the  then  leading  authority  on  the
      question of funding before her (MM [2013] EWHC (Admin) 1900), in a way
      which affected the result  she  reached,  and,  with  the  benefit  of
      hindsight and MM & others [2014] EWCA Civ 985, was wrong in law.

   3. However, even though the Court of Appeal decision  came  out  in  July
      2014, nothing was done about the present case till the entry clearance
      officer noted its effect: finally the application  for  permission  to
      appeal was filed in November last year. This is frankly  explained  in
      section B of the form; but the judge who  permission in the First-tier
      Tribunal neither noted nor dealt with the need  for  an  extension  of
      time of well over a year.

 4. It follows that I have to deal with the extension of time  for  myself.
    Even if an application had been made promptly after the Court of Appeal
    decision, I should not have granted one: while the law as  declared  by
    the Court of Appeal is to be treated as if it had always  been  so,  it
    has never been the practice to allow decisions, however long they  have
    stood, to be re-opened, at least at the instance of state  authorities,
    on the basis of a subsequent re-statement of the law.

Extension of time for appealing refused
