For the Appellant: Ms J Russell of Halliday Reeves Solicitors.
For the Respondent: Mr Dewison - Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Kempton promulgated on 23rd May 2014 following a  hearing  at
        North Shields in which the Judge  dismissed  the  appeal  on  human
        rights and humanitarian protection grounds.


     2. The Appellant was born on 20th May 1985 and is a national of  Iraq.
        The immigration decision under appeal is a refusal to vary leave to
        enter or remain and decision to remove made pursuant to section  47
        of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


     3. The Judge considered the evidence that was provided in relation  to
        the Appellant's family and private life in the United  Kingdom  and
        noted in  paragraph  11  of  the  determination  that  he  heard  a
        considerable amount of evidence. The Judge sets  out  his  findings
        from paragraph 19, including an analysis of the  relationships  the
        Appellant has had with various women in  the  United  Kingdom,  the
        fact a previous asylum claim was dismissed with adverse credibility
        findings  by  Immigration  Judge  Gordon,  an  examination  of  the
        relationship the Appellant has with various children  a  number  of
        whom have been adopted, and in relation to which he  is  restricted
        to indirect post-box contact annually.


     4. The Judge was not  satisfied  the  Appellant  had  established  any
        interference with private or family  life  in  the  United  Kingdom
        which will be disproportionate to  the  legitimate  aim  sought  be
        achieved, namely  that  of  immigration  control,  leading  to  the
        dismissal of the appeal on Article 8 grounds.  Although the way  in
        which this element was considered is not in accordance with current
        thinking or jurisprudence, the  Judge  clearly  concludes  that  no
        unjustifiably harsh consequences arise from the decision.  As  such
        it was not necessary to  consider  the  matter  as  a  freestanding
        Article 8 assessment, although he did, leading to a conclusion  the
        decision is proportionate.  As the outcome of a properly  conducted
        Article 8 assessment will be exactly the same,  any  error  is  not
        material to the dismissal of this element of the claim and  is  not
        challenged before the Tribunal in any event.


     5. In paragraph 22 of the determination the Judge states:


     22.  Miss Russell advanced an argument in  relation  to  the  issue  of
          continuing indiscriminate violence in Iraq  and  that  his  appeal
   shall           be  allowed  on  the  basis  of  Article  15  C  of   the
   Qualification Directive.              However, I am somewhat in the  dark
   as to the appellant's actual fear             on return,  given  that  he
   has not given any up-to-date evidence on the           situation for  him
   if he is returned to his home country. I was  referred            to  the
   objective  evidence  generally  in  that  regard.  However,  I   am   not
   persuaded  that  the  appellant  has  provided   anything   like   enough
   evidence  on  the  matter  of  risk  on  return  to  him,  even  if   the
   generalised issue of continuing violence is  advanced  as  opposed  to  a
     specific threat to him. The appellant claimed  a  fear  of  persecution
     when he left Iraq. However,  his  asylum  claim  was  refused  and  the
   appellant has not provided any evidence himself at  the  hearing  of  his
     fear on return.


     6. The grounds are long and in part contain a summary of the facts  of
        the case as advanced  and  a  copy  of  the  index  of  information
        submitted to the First-tier Tribunal. They  challenge  the  Judge's
        conclusions in paragraph 22 claiming the Judge has  not  adequately
        addressed the grounds submitted and to equate the decision in  this
        case to a refugee claim.


     7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it  may  be  arguable
        that the Judge was wrong to conclude that  the  appellant  had  not
        explained his actual  fear  of  return  and  not  given  up-to-date
        evidence on the situation when the skeleton argument  submitted  at
        the hearing and documentation contained in the bundle appear to set
        out the detail of that claim.



Error of law


     8. Miss Russell confirmed that the challenge is to the finding of  the
        Judge that the Appellant could not succeed  with  his  humanitarian
        protection claim only.


     9. Paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules states:

         A person will be granted humanitarian  protection  in  the  United
    Kingdom if the         Secretary of State is satisfied that:


         (i)  he is in the United Kingdom or has arrived at a port of entry
    in the United              Kingdom;
         (ii)     he does not qualify as a refugee as defined in regulation
    2  of  The  Refugee            or  Person  in  Need  of   International
    Protection (Qualification) Regulations           2006;
         (iii)    substantial grounds have been shown  for  believing  that
    the person                 concerned, if returned  to  the  country  of
    return, would face a real risk of            suffering serious harm and
    is unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to           avail himself
    of the protection of that country; and
          (iv)      he  is  not  excluded  from  a  grant  of  humanitarian
    protection.


         Serious harm consists of:


         (i)  the death penalty or execution;
         (ii)     unlawful killing;
         (iii)    torture or inhuman or degrading treatment  or  punishment
    of a person in             the country of return; or
         (iv)     serious and individual threat to  a  civilian's  life  or
    person by reason of             indiscriminate violence  in  situations
    of international or internal armed           conflict.


    10. The key question for the Judge was whether there is in Iraq,  or  a
        material part of it, such a high level of  indiscriminate  violence
        that substantial grounds exist for  believing  that  the  Appellant
        would, solely by being  present  there,  face  a  real  risk  which
        threatens his life or person.


    11. In HM and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409(IAC) the
        Tribunal decided that the  guidance  as  to  the  law  relating  to
        Article 15(c) of the  Refugee  Qualification  Directive  2004/83/EC
        given by the Tribunal in HM and  Others  (Article  15(c))  Iraq  CG
        [2010] UKUT 331  (IAC)  ("HM1")  at  [62]-[78]  is  reaffirmed.  Of
        particular importance is the  observation  in  HM1  that  decision-
        makers ensure that following Elgafaji, Case C-465/07; [2009]  EUECJ
        and QD (Iraq) [2009] EWCA Civ 620, in situations of armed  conflict
        in which civilians are affected by the fighting,  the  approach  to
        assessment of the level of risk of indiscriminate violence must  be
        an inclusive one, subject only to  the  need  for  there  to  be  a
        sufficient causal nexus between the violence and the conflict.


    12. In a recent case  the  Court  of  Justice  of  the  European  Union
        considered this issue too.  In Diakit� v  Commissaire  g�n�ral  aux
        r�fugi�s et aux apatrides (Case C-285/12) CJEU (Fourth Chamber), it
        was held  that  on  a  proper  construction  of  Article  15(c)  of
        Directive 2004/83/EC, an internal armed conflict existed,  for  the
        purposes of applying that provision,  if  a  State's  armed  forces
        confronted one or more armed groups or if two or more armed  groups
        confronted each other. It was not necessary for that conflict to be
        categorised as 'armed conflict not of an  international  character'
        under international humanitarian law; nor was it necessary to carry
        out, in addition to an appraisal of the level of  violence  present
        in the territory concerned, a separate assessment of the  intensity
        of the armed confrontations, the level of organisation of the armed
        forces involved or the  duration  of  the  conflict.  The  decision
        contained a reminder that the more the applicant is  able  to  show
        that he is specifically affected by reason of factors particular to
        his personal circumstances the lower the  level  of  indiscriminate
        violence required for him to be eligible for subsidiary protection.


    13. The Appellant's asylum claim has been dismissed and  the  basis  of
        that claim found to lack credibility, indicating that the Appellant
        was eligible  for  consideration  of  his  humanitarian  protection
        claim. Miss Russell, in her grounds seeking permission  to  appeal,
        asserts that paragraph 29 of the skeleton argument provided for the
        First-tier Tribunal hearing referred to the fact that  the  country
        guidance of HM and others [ 2010] UKUT 331 has been quashed by  the
        Court of Appeal and should no  longer  be  followed  and  that  the
        relevant Article 15 C arguments had been removed from  the  country
        guidance case of MK [2012] UKUT 126 and that although the  decision
        of HM2 has since been promulgated this has  been  appealed  to  the
        Supreme Court and is not good law in light of  the  change  in  the
        country  situation.  However,  this  submission  appears  to  be  a
        misrepresentation of the current  legal  position  with  regard  to
        Iraq. It is correct that HM [2010] was set aside  but  the  current
        country guidance case is HM and others (article  15  (c))  Iraq  CG
        [2012] UKUT 00409 which is also referred to as HM2.


    14. In HM and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq  CG  [2012]  UKUT  00409(IAC)
        (October 2012) the Tribunal decided that:


              (i)      Whilst the focus  of  the  present  decision  is  the
   current  situation  in                   Iraq,  nothing  in  the  further
   evidence now available indicates that  the                    conclusions
   that   the   Tribunal   in   HM   and   Others   (Article   15(c))   Iraq
   CG   [2010]   UKUT   331   (IAC)   ("HM1")    reached    about    country
   conditions in Iraq were wrong;


              (ii)     As regards the current situation, the  evidence  does
   not establish that               the degree  of  indiscriminate  violence
   characterising the current                    armed conflict taking place
   in  the  five  central  governorates  in  Iraq,                    namely
   Baghdad,   Diyala,    Tameen    (Kirkuk),    Ninewah,    Salah    Al-Din,
   is at such a high level that substantial  grounds  have  been  shown  for
          believing that any civilian returned there would solely on account
   of                  his presence there face a real risk of being  subject
   to that threat;


              (iii)    Nor does the evidence establish that there is a  real
   risk of serious                  harm under Article 15(c)  for  civilians
   who are Sunni or Shi'a or                     Kurds or have former Ba'ath
   Party  connections:  these  characteristics                 do   not   in
   themselves    amount    to    "enhanced    risk     categories"     under
   Article 15(c)'s "sliding scale" (see [39] of Elgafaji);


              (iv)     Further evidence that has become available since  the
   Tribunal heard                   MK  (documents  -  relocation)  Iraq  CG
   [2012] UKUT 126 (IAC) does                not warrant any departure  from
   its conclusions on internal  relocation                  alternatives  in
   the   KRG   or   in   central   or   southern   Iraq   save   that    the
   evidence is now sufficient  to  establish  the  existence  of  a  Central
          Archive  maintained  by  the  Iraqi  authorities  retaining  civil
   identity                records on microfiche, which provides  a  further
   way in which  a                    person  can  identify  themselves  and
   obtain a copy of their  CSID,                   whether  from  abroad  or
   within Iraq.


    15. This determination was challenged to  the  Court  of  Appeal  whose
        judgment is reported as HF (Iraq) and others v Secretary  of  State
        for the Home Department [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1276.  The  claimant,  a
        failed asylum seeker,  unsuccessfully  challenged  HM2.  The  Court
        rejected an argument that there was justification for conferring  a
        presumptively binding status on UNHCR  reports  merely  because  of
        their source. The Court had to assess all  the  evidence  affording
        such weight to different pieces of evidence  as  it  saw  fit.  The
        appeal in MK was remitted to the Upper Tribunal for a  reassessment
        on a factual basis in light of the comments by the Court of Appeal,
        but no more.


    16. The Appellant has failed to establish there is any  arguable  merit
        in the claim that the country guidance cases relating to Iraq  have
        been set aside or cannot  be  relied  upon  as  statements  of  the
        current  position  in  relation  to  the  humanitarian   protection
        situation in Iraq. I  accept  that  in  certain  circumstances  the
        Tribunal is entitled to depart from  a  country  guidance  case  if
        there has been a material change in circumstances or other elements
        to justify such conclusion, but it has not been established on  the
        basis of material provided to the First-tier Tribunal  that such an
        approach is justified.


    17. The Judge was clearly aware that the question before the First-tier
        Tribunal was whether the Appellant  was  entitled  to  a  grant  of
        humanitarian protection for that is  specifically  referred  to  in
        paragraph 22 and that claim refused in the  concluding  section  of
        the determination. I find the Judge clearly considered the evidence
        provided with the required degree of anxious scrutiny and the claim
        that the Judge should have done more by reference  to  the  witness
        statements or country information has no arguable  merit  and  does
        not establish legal  error.  The  obligation  upon  the  First-tier
        Tribunal  is  to  consider  the  evidence  appropriately  and  give
        adequately reasoned findings to support the conclusions  they  have
        arrived at. The answer to the key question posed above is  that  on
        the basis of the information provided by the Appellant  in  support
        of his case he has not substantiated his claim that he will  be  at
        risk in Iraq of serious  harm,  notwithstanding  the  deteriorating
        situation in some parts of that country and  the  ongoing  internal
        armed conflict.


    18. Returns to Iraq tend to be to Baghdad Airport  unless  arrangements
        are made to return individuals to the Kurdish north.  None  of  the
        material provided shows that such routes are no  longer  available,
        notwithstanding the recent advances  by  IS,  or  that  individuals
        returning to Iraq will be at risk as a result of any internal armed
        conflict that is ongoing between the forces of the Iraqi State  and
        IS, or that as a result of  his  presence  in  parts  of  Iraq  not
        controlled by IS there is a real risk of serious harm.


    19. Having reviewed the evidence made available to the First-tier,  the
        submissions and findings made at the hearing, and those before  the
        Upper Tribunal, I do not find  the  Appellant  has  discharged  the
        burden of proof upon him to the required standard to show  that  he
        is entitled to a grant of  humanitarian  protection  as  there  are
        clearly parts of Iraq to which he can return  where  no  such  real
        risk exists.


    20. The Appellant is reminded in this respect of the recently  reported
        decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  VHR  (unmeritorious  grounds)
        Jamaica [2014] UKUT 00367 (IAC) which found that appeals should not
        be mounted on the basis of  a  litany  of  forensic  criticisms  of
        particular findings of the First Tier Tribunal, whilst ignoring the
        basic legal test which the appellant has to meet.


    21. Although the Judge may have been  able  to  write  a  substantially
        longer determination a finding that the required legal test has not
        been met has not been shown to be perverse, irrational, or contrary
        to the available evidence.


Decision

    22. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    23. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.  I make no such order pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
