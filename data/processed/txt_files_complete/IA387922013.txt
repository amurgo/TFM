    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr P Duffy a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: the respondent attended but was not legally
represented

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department ("the
      Secretary of State"). The respondent is a citizen of India who was
      born on 16 March 1983 ("the claimant"). The Secretary of State has
      been given permission to appeal the determination of First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge Cohen ("the FTTJ"). The FTTJ allowed the claimant's
      appeal against the Secretary of State's decisions of 23 August 2013 to
      refuse to vary his leave to remain in the UK and to remove him from
      the UK by way of directions under section 47 of the Immigration and
      Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The claimant had applied for further
      leave to remain in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under
      the Points-based System and for a Biometric Residence Permit.


   2. The claimant first entered the UK on 20 December 2009 with entry
      clearance as a student giving him leave until 25 June 2011. This was
      subsequently extended until 30 April 2014. On 16 May 2013 the
      claimant's then current leave to remain as a student was curtailed so
      as to expire on 15 July 2013. The current application was submitted on
      12 July 2013.


   3. The Secretary of State refused the application on the basis that the
      claimant was not entitled to the required 30 points for Confirmation
      of Acceptance for Studies (CAS). In his English language test,
      conducted by Pearson, he had scored 61 for Listening, 50 for Reading,
      68 for Speaking and 59 for Writing. He was required to score a minimum
      of 51 points in all four components in order to achieve or exceed
      level B2 of the Common European Framework for Language Learning
      (CEFR). Having failed to do so he had not achieved the minimum
      standard of English required and was not entitled to the points for
      his CAS. It was accepted that the claimant was entitled to the
      required 10 points for Maintenance (Funds).


   4. The claimant appealed. He said that he had not been advised by his
      college that the English language test result was unsatisfactory. He
      had been issued with the CAS. He believed that his Tier 4 sponsor
      should be held responsible for this mistake. However, in the meantime,
      he had retaken the test and was awaiting the results. He had made an
      honest and small mistake and asked to be allowed to continue and
      finish his studies in the UK.


   5. Both parties were represented at the hearing before the FTTJ and the
      claimant gave evidence. The FTTJ found that the Secretary of State had
      acted unreasonably. The claimant had achieved level B2 and his results
      were on the whole excellent. They were sufficient for his college to
      issue the CAS. The Secretary of State's decision was disproportionate
      and not in accordance with the law. Furthermore, the appellant had
      taken a further English language test which did meet the requirements
      of the Rules. The Secretary of State had accepted that he met the
      other requirements.


   6. The FTTJ went on to consider the appeal on Article 8 human rights
      grounds, concluding that the interference with his private life would
      be a disproportionate interference with his Article 8 human rights.


   7. The FTTJ allowed the appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on
      Article 8 human rights grounds. The Secretary of State applied for and
      was granted permission to appeal. The grounds argue that the FTTJ
      erred in law in two ways. Firstly it was not permissible to consider
      the results of the English language test conducted after the date of
      the claimant's application. The claimant was not entitled to succeed
      on the basis of a "near miss". There was no obvious lack of admissible
      evidence which could engage any evidential flexibility policy.
      Secondly, in relation to the Article 8 grounds, the FTTJ applied an
      incorrect standard of proof; the claimant had no family ties in the UK
      and had acquired his private life as a result of coming here for a
      limited period in order to pursue his studies. There was nothing in
      his private life which was either exceptional or very compelling.


   8. The Secretary of State's appeal came before one of us (Judge Moulden)
      on 1 May 2014. I could find nothing in any of the papers submitted by
      either party which supported the contention in the decision letter of
      23 August 2014 that the claimant had failed to achieve level B2 of the
      CEFR or that the minimum score in each component was 51. I had the
      Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies Details from the UK Border
      Agency which appeared to show that the claimant had attained CEFR
      level B2. It also gave the name of the provider, Pearson, and set out
      the marks in each of the four components without any indication as to
      the required minimum mark either in each of them or overall. I also
      had a single page document entitled "PTE Academic Institutions Score
      Report" issued by Pearson which, whilst giving the marks for each
      component, said nothing about whether the claimant had passed or
      failed or what any minimum requirement might be. In the circumstances,
      I adjourned the hearing and gave directions for further information
      and documents to be produced together with skeleton arguments.


   9. We now have a substantial bundle of documents and a skeleton argument
      from the Secretary of State. Mr Duffy relied on the decision letter
      and the grounds of appeal. He argued that paragraphs 116 and 118 in
      Appendix A were unambiguous. The claimant was required to achieve or
      exceed level B2 in all four components namely, reading, writing,
      speaking and listening. We were referred to the 71 page "PTE Academic
      Score Guide" and the document entitled "Interpreting the PTE Academic
      Score Report" in the new bundle. The latter, at Tab C, sets out a
      detailed explanation and the conclusion that "A score of at least 51
      is required for UKBA tier 4 student visas for students wanting to
      study on a course at or above degree level at an institution that is
      not a UK Higher Education Institution." Taken in the context of all
      that is said in this document we find that the requirement is for a
      score of at least 51 in each of the four components. The claimant
      scored 51 or more in three of them but fell short with a score of 50
      for Reading. The Secretary of State has therefore established that the
      claimant did not achieve level B2 of the CEFR and was not entitled to
      the required 30 points for CAS.


  10. The claimant told us that he had been misled. He had spoken to Pearson
      who had not given him any information about the requirement for a
      minimum score. They had told him that there was no information about
      this on their website. We went through the document entitled
      "Interpreting the PTE Academic Score Report" with him. He said that he
      understood this. He did not dispute the conclusion which we have
      reached in the last paragraph. Whilst we invited him to do so the
      claimant said that he did not wish to say anything further in relation
      to his Article 8 human rights grounds.


  11. In reply to our questions, Mr Duffy said that if the claimant's
      original appeal failed he would, within 28 days, be entitled to make a
      fresh application on the same or a similar basis. If, as the claimant
      claimed, the Secretary of State was holding his passport and he needed
      this for any purpose, including applying for and sitting another
      English language test, we made it clear that on request it should be
      returned to him without delay.


  12. We find that the FTTJ erred in law. On the evidence it was not open to
      him to conclude that the claimant was entitled to the required points
      for CAS or that there was any discretion or test of reasonableness in
      deciding whether he met the requirements of the Immigration Rules for
      a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under the Points-based System. It
      has not been claimed that the there is any relevant evidential
      flexibility provision within the Immigration Rules or under any
      separate policy which might benefit the claimant. This is not a case
      of a missing or incomplete document. He is not entitled to benefit
      from any "near miss" as is clear from the opinion of Lord Carnwath in
      Patel & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC
      72. The FTTJ was limited to considering evidence adduced by the
      claimant in support of and at the time of making his application,
      which would not include any English language test passed by the
      claimant after the date of the application.


  13. We find that the FTTJ erred in law in relation to the Article 8
      grounds as claimed in the grounds of appeal. In paragraph 14 of the
      determination he applied an incorrect standard of proof. It is not the
      asylum standard of whether there are "substantial grounds for
      believing there is a real risk of harm or, alternatively, a
      substantial degree of likelihood of harm". It is the civil standard of
      the balance of probabilities.


  14. The FTTJ erred in law. The errors are such that the determination must
      be set aside.


  15. For the reasons we have already given the claimant has not
      established, to the standard of the balance of probabilities, that he
      meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules for a Tier 4 (General)
      Student Migrant under the Points-based System. In this respect his
      appeal under this part of the Immigration Rules fails.


  16. It has not at any stage been suggested and we cannot see that the
      claimant could succeed on Article 8 human rights grounds under the
      provisions of the Immigration Rules.


  17. In the circumstances we apply the principles set out in Gulshan
      (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC). The
      summary of the provisions of Gulshan, prepared by the author of that
      determination Cranston J states;


           "On the current state of the authorities:


           (a)    the maintenance requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,
           although Blake J in R (on the application of MM)  v Secretary of
           State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said that
           they  could  constitute  an  unjustified  and   disproportionate
           interference with the ability of spouses to  live  together;  he
           suggested that an appropriate figure may be around �13,400,  and
           highlighted the position of young people and  low  wage  earners
           caught by the higher figure in the rules;
           (b)    after applying the requirements of the  Rules,  only  if
           there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to  remain
           outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on  to
           consider  whether  there  are   compelling   circumstances   not
           sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the  application  of)
           Nagre v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013]  EWHC
           720 (Admin);
           (c)    the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such as
           Section  EX.1  are  not  obstacles  which  are   impossible   to
           surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]  UKUT  393
           (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC); they
           concern  the  practical  possibilities  of  relocation.  In  the
           absence of such insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to
           show other non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating
           that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.


           The Secretary of State addressed the Article 8 family aspects of
           the respondent's position through the Rules, in particular  EX1,
           and the private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge
           should  have  done  likewise,  also  paying  attention  to   the
           Guidance. Thus the judge should have considered the Secretary of
           State's conclusion under EX.1 that there were no  insurmountable
           obstacles preventing the continuation of the family life outside
           the UK. Only if there were arguably good  grounds  for  granting
           leave to remain outside the rules was it necessary for  him  for
           Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were
           compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised  under  the
           Rules."


  18. The Secretary of State did not address any Article 8 human rights
      grounds in the decision letter of 23 August 2013. The claimant has no
      family or family life in this country and his removal would not breach
      his rights to family life. Whilst the FTTJ found and we accept that he
      has established a private life here he came to this country as a
      student and in the knowledge that this would only entitle him to
      remain for a finite period. He has successfully pursued his studies so
      far and was unfortunate when he had to change courses because the
      college he was attending lost its sponsor's license. Although we have
      a little information about the nature and extent of his private life
      in this country we accept that he has probably made friends and has a
      circle of acquaintances. We take into account Mr Duffy's confirmation
      that if he does so within 28 days the claimant will be able to make a
      fresh in country application.


  19. We find that there are no arguably good grounds for granting the
      appellant leave to remain outside the provisions of the Immigration
      Rules. Even if we had concluded otherwise we would have found that
      there were no compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised
      under the Rules. The Secretary of State has established, to the
      standard of the balance of probabilities, that it would not be a
      disproportionate interference with the claimant's right to respect for
      his Article 8 private life to remove him from the UK.


  20. We have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and can see no
      good reason to do so.


  21. Having set aside the decision of the FTTJ we substitute our decision
      and dismiss the claimant's appeals both under the Immigration Rules
      and on Article 8 human rights grounds.
