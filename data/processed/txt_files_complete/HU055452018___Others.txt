Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellants as the appellants herein.   They  are  citizens  of
    India and are husband and wife aged 36 and  33  respectively,  and  the
    third named appellant is their 4 year old child.  Any reference to  the
    appellant is a reference to the first named appellant.  The appeals  of
    the second and third named appellants depend  on  the  outcome  of  the
    appeal in respect of the first appellant.  There is no dispute that the
    appellant had been lawfully resident in the  UK  for  over  ten  years,
    having arrived in 2007 and having leave to remain until December  2016.
    He was joined by his wife and child in 2013 and 2014 respectively.  The
    Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's  application   applying
    paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.  The basis for the refusal is summarised
    by the First-tier Judge as follows:

         "10. The Respondent states that the First Appellant, when making an
             application in April  2010,  claimed  to  have  an  income  of
             �35,778 from both self-employment and PAYE employment.  In May
             2017, he was  asked  by  the  Respondent  to  complete  a  tax
             questionnaire and to provide evidence of his earnings for  his
             years of self-employment.  In response to the questionnaire he
             confirmed that he had needed to correct a tax  return  in  the
             past and provided details of those corrections [122].  He had,
             in fact, only declared �20,460 in earnings to HMRC in the year
             2010/11.  If his true earnings had been declared to them,  the
             Respondent stated, he would not have been granted leave.


         11.  The First Appellant denied  that  he  had  intentionally  made
             false representations to either the Respondent or HMRC.   That
             was his first year of trading and he knew little  of  the  tax
             system  and  therefore,  having  passed  over   the   relevant
             paperwork to his accountant, he relied on  them  to  file  his
             return accurately -  he  had  not  checked  it  himself.   The
             matters only came to his attention in December 2015,  when  he
             and his father were considering buying some land in India  and
             he was required to provide tax details of his earnings in  UK.
             He said that he and his father  were  buying  this  land  from
             savings and that  no  mortgage  loan  was  required.   He  was
             challenged therefore as to why any prospective purchaser would
             need to know his tax affairs, when all he and his  father  had
             to do was show evidence of those savings.  He was  not  really
             able to explain, simply stating that information was required.
              He contacted his accountant, who rectified the error  without
             delay and he repaid the tax due, of  �8912  and  was  given  a
             penalty of about �400.  The Accountant, Right  Solutions  Ltd,
             provided a letter, dated 2 October 2018 stated that  they  had
             acted in error at the time.  He was also challenged as to  why
             it took until August 2016 for the payment to be  made  and  he
             said that that was how long HMRC took to process  the  matter.
             HMRC had not accused him of dishonesty.


         12.  He was asked as to whether he had  made  a  complaint  to  the
             Accountant's professional body,  particularly  concerning  the
             risk the negligence had posed to his  immigration  status  and
             said he had not, as the Accountant had apologised  and  agreed
             to discount future bills, also taking account of  the  penalty
             he'd had to pay".

    The judge considered the submissions made on behalf of the Secretary of
    State.  Reliance was placed on the refusal decision.  The fact that the
    tax arrears had been paid did not mean that the appellant  had  behaved
    honestly.


2.   The appellant's Counsel referred to the case of Shaik  v  Secretary  of
    State [2017] UKUT JR/8324 which indicated that:

         "A single mistake (albeit a  significant  one)  in  the  first  tax
         return he was required to file might be viewed in a different light
         to a series of mistakes that are corrected at a later date ...  the
         fact that there was evidence to indicate  that  the  returns  filed
         after 2010/11 were not amended (as is the case in this appeal)  was
         a relevant consideration".

    It was pointed out that this was the appellant's  first  tax  year  and
    reference  was  made  to  Samant  v  Secretary  of  State  [2017]  UKUT
    JR/6546/2016 which indicated that if it were accepted by an  accountant
    that the error was theirs "this would be an exceedingly powerful  point
    in his favour".  The First-tier Judge made the following findings:

         "15. I do not consider that the  Respondent  is  able  to  rely  on
             paragraph 322(5),  in  respect  of  the  tax  liability.   The
             Respondent's own guidance (January 2018) indicates  that  'the
             main type of cases you need  to  consider  for  refusal  under
             paragraph 322(5) ... are those  that  involve  criminality,  a
             threat to national security, war crimes  or  travel  bans  ...
             this  may  include  cases  where  a  migrant  has  entered  or
             facilitated a sham marriage'.  There is no criminal act  here;
             the First Appellant declared the 'error' and  has  voluntarily
             repaid the money.  The burden is on  the  Respondent  to  show
             dishonesty on the Appellant's part and I don't  consider  that
             the Respondent has discharged that burden, for  the  following
             reasons:


             (i)  the Appellant has provided an alternative explanation for
                  the  under-declaration,  namely  his  Accountant's  error,
                  backed up by correspondence from that Accountant (Samant).
                   I have  no  reason  to  doubt  that  evidence.   I  don't
                  consider any failure to complain about the  Accountant  to
                  be significant, when the error has been rectified and  the
                  Appellant is content that he will not be out of pocket.


             (ii) The Appellant has stated that he trusted his  Accountant,
                  it was his first year of trading and he had  no  knowledge
                  of such matters.


             (iii)    His tax affairs have been in order for the subsequent
                  five years (Shaikh).


             (iv) While his explanation as to how he discovered  the  error
                  was unclear, it's not entirely implausible that an  Indian
                  property vendor  may  require  the  documentation  he  has
                  referred to".

3.   In dealing with the human rights appeal the  judge  took  into  account
    the  fact  that  the  appellant  on  his  findings  met  the   relevant
    requirements  of  the  Rules  and  weighed  up  the   public   interest
    considerations, noting that on  his  findings  the  appellant  had  not
    breached the Rules.  The appellant met the financial  requirements  and
    all the appellants spoke English.  While  the  appellant's  status  had
    been precarious it was not appropriate to attach "no weight" to it.  It
    was not a period of time that should be entirely discounted in all  the
    circumstances.  Reference was made to Treebhawon [2017] UKUT 13  (IAC).
    The judge accordingly found  that  removal  from  the  UK  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with the family's right  to  respect  for
    private life.  He allowed the appeal under Article 8.  In applying  for
    permission to appeal the Secretary of State argued that the  judge  had
    erred in paragraph 15 of his determination in  considering  that  cases
    that fell for consideration under paragraph 322(5) were criminal cases.
     322(5) called into question a person's character  or  conduct  to  the
    extent that it was undesirable to allow them to remain in  the  UK  and
    this approach was a much lower standard than that used by the Tribunal.
     The judge had applied an artificially high standard and  his  findings
    were unsafe.  If the Tribunal had applied "this wider standard" it  may
    well have reached a different set of findings.  In the second ground it
    was argued that  the  Tribunal  had  erred  in  having  regard  to  the
    appellant reimbursing payment of tax arrears.  It  was  submitted  that
    this was irrelevant given that it did not go  to  the  motives  of  the
    appellant at the time that  the  financial  discrepancy  occurred.   In
    granting permission to appeal the First-tier Tribunal Judge noted  that
    it was hard to see why the judge had erred  in  referring  to  criminal
    cases since all the judge had done was to quote from the  Secretary  of
    State's own guidance.  However, the judge had gone on to find that  the
    burden was on the respondent to show dishonesty on the appellant's part
    which was not arguably not the case under paragraph 322(5).

4.   At the hearing Ms Pal referred to the guidance under paragraph  322(5).
     This reads:

         "The main types of cases you need to  consider  for  refusal  under
         paragraph 322(5) or referral to other teams are those that  involve
         criminality, a threat to national security, war  crimes  or  travel
         bans.


         A person does not need to have been convicted of a criminal offence
         for this provision to apply.  When deciding whether to refuse under
         this category, the key thing to consider is if  there  is  reliable
         evidence to support a decision that the  person's  behaviour  calls
         into  question  their  character  and/or   conduct   and/or   their
         associations to the extent that it is undesirable to allow them  to
         enter or remain in the UK.  This may include cases where a  migrant
         has entered, attempted to enter or facilitated a sham  marriage  to
         evade immigration control.  If you are not  sure  the  evidence  to
         support your decision is reliable, then speak to your line  manager
         or senior caseworker".

    Ms Pal submitted that the judge had not set out the guidance  in  full.
    The key thing to consider was whether there was reliable evidence.  The
    judge had applied too high a standard of proof.  The appellant had  had
    to pay a penalty which is a significant  factor.   This  had  not  been
    taken into account.  The judge had materially  erred  in  law  and  his
    error had impacted on his findings in paragraph 20.


5.   Counsel submitted that the judge had given a blow by  blow  account  of
    the evidence and had referred to the penalty in  paragraph  11  of  the
    decision.   There  had  been  no  express  challenge  to  the   judge's
    assessment of the appellant's credibility.  It was  claimed  the  judge
    had misunderstood  paragraph  322(5).   He  did  not  simply  say  that
    paragraph 322(5) was not applicable.  He had gone  on  to  make  proper
    findings in the ensuing subparagraphs.  He had adopted a  careful  belt
    and braces approach.   Ms  Pal  made  no  reply  to  these  submissions
    although I noted she  had  lodged  a  judicial  review  case  -  Abbasi
    JR/13807/2016 and she referred to there  being  a  "plethora"  of  such
    cases.

6.   At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Judge if it was flawed in law.  I note that the  Secretary  of  State's
    position was indicated in the refusal notice at page  6  where  it  was
    stated:

         "It is acknowledged that paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules
         is not a mandatory refusal; however, the  evidence  submitted  does
         not satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to  HMRC
         at the time the PAYE and self-employed  earnings  claimed  on  your
         Tier 1 application of 13 December 2010 was a genuine error.  It  is
         noted that there would have been a clear benefit to yourself either
         by failing to declare your full earnings to HMRC  with  respect  to
         reducing  your  tax  liability  or  by  falsely  representing  your
         earnings to UK Visas & Immigration to enable you to meet the points
         required to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a  Tier
         1 (General) Migrant".

7.   Towards the top of page 7 of the decision it was stated:

         "The Secretary of State considers that it would be undesirable  for
         you to remain in the United Kingdom in light of your character  and
         conduct.  She  is  satisfied  that  you  have  misrepresented  your
         earnings and have changed what you have represented in  respect  of
         your earnings to HM Revenue & Customs and/or UK Visas & Immigration
         for the purpose of reducing your tax liability or for  the  purpose
         of obtaining leave to remain or both".

    It does not appear to have been the Secretary of State's case that  the
    appellant  had  simply  made  an  innocent  error.   The   respondent's
    representative at the hearing indeed stated at paragraph 13(v) that the
    reasons put forward for the error did not mean "that the appellant  has
    behaved honestly in this matter".  The case of Abbasi which Ms Pal  had
    lodged was of course a judicial  review  case,  the  test  was  one  of
    rationality.  In such cases as was said in paragraph 77 of the decision
    "deficiencies  in  tax  returns  and  failure  to  pay  tax  can  infer
    dishonesty and it is open to the Secretary of State to apply  paragraph
    322(5) to such cases".  The decision taken by the Secretary of State in
    this case may or may not have been rational but of course that was  not
    the issue to be determined by the  First-tier  Tribunal.  This  was  an
    appeal and while it would have been open to the  judge  to  have  found
    that the appellant had been  dishonest,  he  did  not  do  so.   It  is
    apparent from the decision itself and  from  the  submissions  made  on
    behalf of the respondent that the appellant's honesty was in  question.
    I am not satisfied that the judge misdirected  himself  as  claimed  or
    that the standard of proof that he applied was too  high.   He  made  a
    careful examination of the facts and was guided  by  reference  to  the
    authorities put before him and was properly entitled to conclude as  he
    did.  I do not find that the judge materially erred in law in referring
    to criminal cases, nor  in  failing  to  consider  the  fact  that  the
    appellant had paid a penalty - reference is made to this at an  earlier
    stage of the decision.


8.   The appellant gave oral evidence before the  First-tier  Judge  and  he
    had been entitled to accept the appellant's explanations for  what  had
    happened and to resolve the submissions in his favour.  Having properly
    directed himself he did not arguably err in law in allowing the  appeal
    under Article 8.

9.   For the reasons I have given the appeal of the Secretary  of  State  is
    dismissed and the decision of the First-tier Judge shall stand.


Anonymity Direction

As one of the appellants is a 4 year old child  I  deem  it  appropriate  to
make an anonymity order in this case.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.


Fee Award

The First-tier Judge made no fee award and in the premises I make none.
