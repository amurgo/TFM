Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss D Revill, Counsel, instructed by Rashid &
                    Rashid Solicitors (Merton High Street)
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is the  remaking  of  a  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Eldridge which was promulgated on 17 October 2016 and set aside  by  me
    on 12 July 2017. Findings in relation to  the  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship between  the  appellant  (as  he  was  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal) and his wife Miss Winifred Oshodie have been preserved.


 2. In addition to the witness statements before the First-tier Tribunal, I
    have had a bundle of papers placed before me  by  the  appellant  which
    includes a supplementary statement from the  appellant  dated  22  June
    2017, and one from his wife dated 23 June 2017 running  to  five  brief
    paragraphs.  Both of those statements predate my error of law decision.
    Although I gave leave for additional evidence to be filed  and  served,
    none has been.


 3. Handed to me at the hearing was  a  small  clip  of  papers,  the  most
    significant of which being a bank statement from HSBC which  indicates,
    (and it is not disputed), that a figure of �2,100 was  paid  into  Miss
    Oshodie's account on 27 June  2017  from  her  employers,  Costain  Ltd
    representing her monthly net salary. That figure  would  be  consistent
    her being in receipt of an annual salary  somewhere  in  the  order  of
    �25,000 gross.


 4. It is regrettable that Miss Oshodie did not attend to give evidence.  I
    heard from the appellant  concerning  a  work  commitment  she  had  in
    Norwich which prevented her travelling, although  the  explanation  was
    somewhat convoluted.


 5. The factual evidence, however, is  not  particularly  contentious.  The
    appellant is a national of Nigeria, born on 7 April  1981.  He  entered
    the United Kingdom in 2009 and overstayed at the expiry of his visa. He
    formed a relationship with Miss Oshodie in 2013 and they married on  13
    November 2014. Judge Eldridge's findings on  the  genuineness  of  that
    subsisting relationship have been preserved and  I  need  not  rehearse
    them.


 6. The appellant maintains that it is not open to him to return to Nigeria
    with his wife because his wife has lived in this country since she  was
    aged 15 and has become accustomed to the British way of  life.  He  has
    many friends here,  whom  he  regards  as  his  family,  having  become
    increasingly more distant from his connections in Nigeria.  He  asserts
    he will be unable to re-integrate. He has no close social, cultural  or
    family ties remaining in Nigeria. He has not returned to Nigeria during
    the seven years he has been  in  the  United  Kingdom.  He  states,  at
    paragraph 10 of his witness statement, "If I am allowed  to  remain  in
    the UK, I would like take [sic] employment in  the  country  and  would
    like to offer a better life for wife [sic] in  the  UK."  He  says,  at
    paragraph 12, it would cause him "extreme hardship and suffering" if he
    is returned  as  he  considers  the  United  Kingdom  to  be  his  home
    "physically, psychologically and emotionally".


 7. He has  never  relied  on  state  benefits  and  has  been  financially
    supported by his wife. He says in paragraph 9 of his witness statement,
    "I regret that I remained in the country illegally  but  that  was  not
    intentionally [sic] and will kindly request the Immigration  Judge  not
    to penalise me for this mistake".


 8. The appellant says his wife is unable to relocate to Nigeria with  him.
    She holds a significant  professional  position  as  a  civil  engineer
    employed by an established  international  company.  She  says  in  her
    witness statement (albeit she was unable to attend the hearing to  give
    live evidence) that she has lived in the United Kingdom for 13-14 years
    and has lost all ties to Nigeria which she considers to  be  "an  alien
    country". All her close friends are here. She points out  (as  recorded
    above) that her annual salary  exceeds  the  minimum  threshold  for  a
    sponsoring spouse. She says she will have considerable difficulties  in
    securing a comparable position in Nigeria. There is a  suggestion  that
    accommodation in Nigeria may not be easy to find.


    9. There was no issue between the parties  on  the  relevant  law.  The
       requirements for leave to  remain  as  a  partner  are  set  out  on
       paragraph R-LTRP of the Immigration Rules. The applicant must not be
       in the United Kingdom in breach of immigration laws (disregarding an
       overstay of 28 days or less), unless  paragraph  EX.1  applies.  The
       relevant  provision  in  the  present  case  is  paragraph   EX.1(b)
       applicable to those who apply for leave to remain as partners:

          "(b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with
          a partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen,  settled  in
          the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or   humanitarian
          protection, and there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
          with that partner continuing outside the UK." (emphasis added)

   10. Paragraph EX.2 adds a  definition  to  the  section  highlighted  as
       follows:

          "For the purposes of paragraph EX.1(b) 'insurmountable obstacles'
          means the very significant difficulties which would be  faced  by
          the applicant or their partner in continuing  their  family  life
          together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or  would
          entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."



11. These provisions were considered at length  by  the  Supreme  Court  in
    Agyarko & Anor v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC
    11. Of particular significance is paragraph 51 of the judgment of  Lord
    Reed which states as follows:

             "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is entitled
             to  remain  in  the  UK   only   temporarily,   however,   the
             significance of this consideration depends on what the outcome
             of immigration control might otherwise be.  For example, if an
             applicant would  otherwise  be  automatically  deported  as  a
             foreign criminal, then the weight of the  public  interest  in
             his or her removal will generally be very considerable. If, on
             the other hand, an applicant - even  if  residing  in  the  UK
             unlawfully - was otherwise certain  to  be  granted  leave  to
             enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the
             UK, then there might be no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
             removal.   The  point  is  illustrated  by  the  decision   in
             Chikwamba v Secretary of State for the Home Department."

12. In applying the provisions of the Immigration Rules in the  context  of
    Agyarko, the question is whether there are insurmountable obstacles  to
    the appellant returning  with  his  spouse  to  Nigeria.   There  would
    undoubtedly be difficulties  and  inconvenience,  but  nothing  in  the
    territory of very serious hardship. That they enjoy a comfortable  life
    with community  ties  here  in  the  United  Kingdom  which  would  not
    immediately be  replicated  in  Nigeria  does  not  come  close  to  an
    insurmountable  obstacle.  The  claim  must   inevitably   fail   under
    paragraphs EX.1(b) and EX.2 of the Immigration Rules.


13. Perhaps recognising the inevitability of that conclusion, Miss  Revill,
    for the appellant,  devoted  the  thrust  of  her  submissions  to  the
    application of Article 8 outside the  Rules.  She  submitted  that  the
    appellant had established a  substantial  family  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom, albeit during a period  when  his  presence  was  unlawful  or
    precarious.  He speaks fluent English and would be likely  to  pass  an
    English language test, and the minimum income threshold is met.


14. Referring to paragraph 51 of Agyarko, Miss Revill submitted  that  this
    is a case where an application for entry clearance would succeed.  Miss
    Revill  used  terminology  such  as  "highly  likely"  and  "more  than
    probable", but she accepts that it falls "a little short  of  certain".
    She drew to my attention that Judge Eldridge considered it likely  that
    such entry clearance would be  granted,  but  conceded  that  his  view
    carries limited weight when the decision is being remade de novo.

15. Mr Avery, for the Secretary of State, pointed to the language  of  Lord
    Reed in paragraph 51 of  Agyarko,  which  says  "might"  be  no  public
    interest rather than "will not". He submitted that there must  be  very
    strong or compelling reasons for  considering  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules, and there is none here. He says  that  the  public  interest  in
    maintaining immigration control is very strong in the case of  a  long-
    term over-stayer such as the appellant, and that little  weight  should
    be given to a private  life  forged  when  an  appellant's  immigration
    status has been precarious. He  indicated  that  the  entirety  of  the
    relationship between the appellant and  Miss  Oshodi  has  taken  place
    while he has been unlawfully in the United Kingdom. He  further  stated
    that it is far from certain that the appellant will  be  granted  entry
    clearance. It is a matter for the relevant office to consider  on  such
    material as is placed before him or her.


  16. Assessing Article 8 outside the Rules, I have regard to  the  approach
      commended by Lord Reed in paragraphs 56 and 57 of Agyarko:


            56. [...] The reference  to  exceptional  circumstances  in  the
            European case law means  that,  in  cases  involving  precarious
            family life, "something  very  compelling  ...  is  required  to
            outweigh the public interest", applying a proportionality  test.
            The Court of Appeal went  on  to  apply  that  approach  to  the
            interpretation  of  the  Rules  concerning  the  deportation  of
            foreign criminals, where the  same  phrase  appears;  and  their
            approach was approved by this court, in that context, in  Hesham
            Ali.

            57. That approach is also appropriate when a court  or  tribunal
            is  considering  whether  a  refusal  of  leave  to  remain   is
            compatible with article 8 in the context  of  precarious  family
            life. Ultimately, it  has  to  decide  whether  the  refusal  is
            proportionate in the particular case before  it,  balancing  the
            strength of the public interest in the removal of the person  in
            question against the impact on private and family life. In doing
            so, it should  give  appropriate  weight  to  the  Secretary  of
            State's policy, expressed in the  Rules  and  the  Instructions,
            that  the  public  interest  in  immigration  control   can   be
            outweighed, when considering an application for leave to  remain
            brought by a person in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  laws,
            only where there are "insurmountable obstacles" or  "exceptional
            circumstances" as defined. It must  also  consider  all  factors
            relevant to the specific  case  in  question,  including,  where
            relevant, the  matters  discussed  in  paras  51-52  above.  The
            critical issue will generally be whether, giving due  weight  to
            the strength of the public interest in the removal of the person
            in the case before it,  the  article  8  claim  is  sufficiently
            strong to outweigh it.  In  general,  in  cases  concerned  with
            precarious family life, a very strong  or  compelling  claim  is
            required to outweigh the public interest in immigration control.
            (emphasis added)

  17. The appellant is an over-stayer who has forged a  private  and  family
      life entirely during a period when his presence has been  unlawful  or
      (at the very least) precarious. The public  interest,  articulated  in
      section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,
      militates strongly in favour of his return to Nigeria, notwithstanding
      the relationship with his wife and  his  other  social  and  community
      ties. That is entirely proportionate to his  right  to  a  family  and
      private life.


18. Whilst the appellant may be granted entry clearance which  would  allow
    him to return at a future date, it cannot be said  that  such  a  grant
    would be certain as contemplated in paragraph 51 of  Agyarko.  Even  if
    the grant of entry clearance is "more than probable"  (to  borrow  from
    Miss Revill) I cannot see anything in the particular  circumstances  of
    the appellant's case to suggest that  it  is  exceptional  such  as  to
    justify allowing his appeal under Article  8  outside  the  Rules.  The
    private and family life considerations in this case do not outweigh the
    public interest in removal.


19. In the circumstances the appellant's appeal must be dismissed.
