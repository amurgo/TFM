For the Appellant:     Mr Samra (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Pacey promulgated on  21st  May  2014,  following  an  appeal  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 12th May 2014.  In the  determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of Jasbir Singh.  The Appellant subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and the matter comes before me.




The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of  India,  who  was  born  on  28th
    February 1991.  He appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State refusing his application for leave to remain in  the
    UK on the basis of his marriage to a British born girl by the  name  of
    Ms Michelle Byng, who is present and settled in the UK, and whom he has
    married on 17th September 2012.




The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim essentially is that his  wife  is  English.   She
    cannot relocate to India for cultural  reasons.   She  does  not  speak
    Punjabi.  She would not obtain a permit in  India.   Moreover,  she  is
    looking after her elderly grandmother, who has cancer.   She  also  had
    family in the UK, including her father and her sister.




The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge noted that the Sponsor herself, Ms Michelle Byng, "is not  of
    Indian  ethnicity  but  is  white  Caucasian,  and  hence  there  is  a
    difference in culture between them".  It  was  also  alleged  that  the
    Appellant's family disapproved of his marriage to Michelle  Byng.   The
    judge made the following findings.

 5. First, the Appellant and his wife, Ms Michelle  Byng,  currently  lived
    separately from their "disapproving family", and there  was  no  reason
    why upon return to India, in a  very  large  country,  they  could  not
    continue to do the same.

 6. Second, there was no suggestion that Indian society generally would not
    accept them for cultural reasons as a couple.

 7. Third, the Appellant had spent most of his life in India himself.

 8. Fourth, English was a very widely spoken  language  in  India  and  the
    Sponsor was educated and the judge held that, "I do not accept that she
    would not be  able  to  obtain  employment  there  and  indeed  when  I
    suggested she could work in a call centre she did not dispute this ..."
    (paragraph 19).

 9. Finally, there was the issue of "caring for  her  elderly  grandmother"
    and the judge held that the support that the grandmother  derives  from
    her granddaughter "is emotional as well as physical, and  an  unrelated
    carer could not provide that emotional support" (paragraph 20).

10. The judge accepted that the grandmother "would miss  her  granddaughter
    should she move to India" but  that  this  is  not  an  "insurmountable
    obstacle" (paragraph  21).   At  the  moment  the  Sponsor  visits  her
    grandmother three times a week and there are four days in a  week  when
    she is not visited by the Sponsor, Ms Michelle Byng.

11. Accordingly, the judge held that the Appellant could not succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules.  As far as Article 8 was  concerned,  the  judge
    held that "Article 8 outside the Rules is not engaged" and  based  this
    upon the analysis in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558 and Gulshan [2013]
    UKUT 00640.




Grounds of Application

12. The grounds of application  state  that  the  judge  did  not  properly
    consider the Immigration Rules.  It is said that the  judge  failed  to
    have regard to the Immigration Rules in making an Article 8 assessment.
     It is also said that the judge should have applied Article  8  outside
    the Immigration Rules.

13. On 1st July 2014, permission to appeal was granted on  the  basis  that
    the judge arguably failed to apply Article 8  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules.

14. On 9th July 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered on the basis that  the
    judge having applied Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  found  that
    the Appellant did not meet the Rules, and the  judge  was  entitled  to
    apply Gulshan,  and  asked  whether  compelling  circumstances  existed
    requiring a consideration of Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules.
    Having done so, the Judge was right to conclude as she did.




Submissions

15. At the hearing before me on 5th September 2014, Mr Samra, appearing  on
    behalf of the Appellant took me  through  the  determination  of  Judge
    Pacey.  He stated that the judge held (at paragraph 16) that the couple
    had a genuine and subsisting relationship and  that  "the  only  issue,
    therefore, is whether there are insurmountable obstacles to the  couple
    moving to India" (paragraph 16).  One issue was whether  the  Appellant
    could meet the financial threshold requirement for  a  married  couple.
    This is set at ï¿½18,600 under the Rules.  The Appellant could  not  meet
    this because, as a student he is only allowed to work twenty hours  per
    week, which necessarily  brings  his  income  down  below  to  what  is
    realistically achievable, such that he would always fails to meet  with
    the Rules.  That must mean that there were insurmountable obstacles  in
    his path.

16. Second, in applying the  exceptions  in  the  Immigration  Rules  under
    EX1(b) the judge was wrong to conclude that there were  "no  compelling
    circumstances in this case" (paragraph 25).  This  is  because  if  the
    Appellant met all the other requirements, including that  the  marriage
    was genuine and subsisting, then there were compelling circumstances to
    consider.  The evidence before the judge was that his  sponsoring  wife
    was "heavily involved in caring for her elderly grandmother" (paragraph
    20).  The Appellant himself could not  work  more  than  twenty  hours.
    These are all compelling circumstances.  He asked me to make a  finding
    of an error of law to allow the appeal.

17. For his part, Mr Mills stated that the Court of Appeal judgment  of  MM
    (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985 did  not  support  the  arguments  of  Mr
    Samra.  Attention had been drawn, in the documentation  that  Mr  Samra
    had handed to court at the outset, to his reference to paragraph 134 of
    Lord Justice Aikens's judgment.  The judge  had  held  that  where  the
    Immigration Rules are not  a  "complete  code"  the  decision-maker  is
    entitled to look at the various factors that can be taken into  account
    in the decision.  Even  where  there  are  references  to  "exceptional
    circumstances" in the code,  there  will  still  be  a  proportionality
    exercise to carry out.  The fact was that Appendix FM  was  a  complete
    code.  Even if the Sponsor was a British citizen, consideration had  to
    be given to whether she could realistically relocate to a country  like
    India, which the judge here gave proper reasons for so finding, and the
    new Rules did now refer to a requirement of "exceptional circumstances"
    and these had to be applied to every spouse regardless of  his  or  her
    circumstances.  Applying the considerations,  it  was  clear  that  the
    judge  had  reached  the  right  decision  on  the  right  balance   of
    considerations.

18. In reply, Mr Samra  submitted  that  the  judge  was  simply  wrong  at
    paragraph 25 to say that Article 8 was not engaged.




No Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law such that I should set
    aside that decision under Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007)  and  remake  the
    decision.  I am aware that Mr Samra has very skilfully  put  before  me
    the relevant excerpts from MM (Lebanon),  together  with  the  relevant
    paragraph from Sanade [2012] UKUT 00048, together with the excerpt from
    EX.1 relating to "exceptions to certain  eligibility  requirements  for
    leave to remain as a partner or parent".  The essential  question  here
    is whether there are "insurmountable obstacles to  family  life".   The
    issue  is  serious  enough  to  be   considered   in   terms   of   the
    proportionality of the decision made.

20. The biggest obstacle facing the Sponsor from going  to  India,  is  not
    that she would not get a job there because she accepts that  she  would
    (see paragraph 19) but that she is "heavily involved in caring for  her
    elderly grandmother".  This care, however, is not a 24 hour  care  that
    she is providing, but only one where the Sponsor visits her grandmother
    three times a week (see paragraph 21).

21. Even more importantly, however, there is no  evidence,  and  there  was
    none before the judge, that social services, who have  extracted  their
    obligation to provide care for the elderly,  have  refused  to  provide
    such care.

22. In the circumstances, the judge was entitled to  reach  the  conclusion
    that there were no insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing
    if the Appellant were to return to India.  In any event, it is open  to
    the Appellant to return to India and to make an application to join his
    spouse in the UK as and when he becomes eligible to do so.

Decision

23. There is no true error of law in the original  judge's  decision.   The
    determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity order is made.
