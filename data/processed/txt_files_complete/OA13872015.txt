For the Appellant:     Mr Khalid a Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mrs Peterson a Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
       enter on 11 December 2014. His appeal was  dismissed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Tindal ("the Judge") following a consideration of the
       papers on 13 August 2015. I note here that the Respondent is not the
       Secretary of State for the Home Department as wrongly identified  by
       the Judge as this was an out of country application and appeal.

The grant of permission


    2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes granted permission  to  appeal  (15
       January 2016) stating that:


             "4. This was by any standard an extraordinarily brief  decision
             given the nature of the issues raised, and the evidence  relied
             upon, even though the appeal was listed for disposal  upon  the
             papers filed (which are voluminous). It is well  arguable  that
             the Judge failed to engage with the evidence  before  him,  and
             the issues raised by the decision and the  grounds  of  appeal,
             and thus failed to address his mind to  the  findings  of  fact
             that needed to be made. There is, for example,  no  attempt  at
             all to engage with either the Article 8 appeal, or the issue of
             whether this was a genuine and a subsisting marriage. The Judge
             apparently instead chose to dismiss the appeal for lack of  one
             month's bank statement,  without  considering  the  Appellant's
             explanation for its omission  from  the  application,  and  his
             subsequent production of it  in  evidence  in  support  of  the
             appeal.


             5. In the circumstances it is  well  arguable  that  the  Judge
             failed to engage with the disputed issues of fact raised before
             him, and failed to engage with the grounds of  appeal,  and  to
             give adequate reasons for his decision to dismiss the appeal."


Respondent's position on 20 April 2016

    3. When this matter was initially listed before me at an error  law  of
       law hearing, Mr Diwnycz (who  represented  the  Respondent  at  that
       hearing) relied on the Rule 24 notice (22 January 2016) which stated
       that the Judge directed himself appropriately, had no oral evidence,
       had to dismiss the appeal given the inadequate documentary evidence,
       and a fresh application is the best course of action.


Appellant's position on 20 April 2016


    4. The missing part of the bank statement had been submitted  with  the
       notice of appeal and should have been considered by  the  Respondent
       and Judge.

Discussion regarding whether there was an error of law

    5. The decision  comprises  7  paragraphs  of  just  over  1  ï¿½  pages.
       Paragraph  1  is  preamble.  Paragraph  2  sets  out  parts  of  the
       immigration rules. Paragraph 3 briefly considers SS (Congo)  v  SSHD
       [2015] EWCA Civ 387. Paragraph  4  summarises  the  refusal  letter.
       Paragraph 5 states that the missing document is fatal.  Paragraph  6
       said that the Judge  assumes  that  the  couple  are  in  a  genuine
       relationship. Paragraph 7 announces the decision.


    6. The Judge notes that the missing evidence  was  submitted  with  the
       notice of appeal. The Judge does not consider Mandalia v SSHD [2015]
       UKSC 59 or DR (ECO: post decision evidence)  Morocco*  [2005]  UKAIT
       00038.  He  does  not  consider  the  Respondent's  own   evidential
       flexibility policy as set out in  Appendix  FM-SE  D  (b)  (i)  (aa)
       regarding where part of a series of otherwise intact bank statements
       is missing. In my judgement the decision was inadequate for all  the
       reasons given by Judge Holmes which I will  not  simply  repeat  and
       fully endorse.   That  amounted  to  a  material  error  of  law.  I
       therefore set the decision aside.


    7. Both representatives agreed that I need not remit the matter to  the
       First-Tier Tribunal. Mr Diwnycz confirmed that, despite the  brevity
       of  the  consideration  of  the  nature  of  the  relationship,  the
       Respondent was not seeking to go behind  the  finding  that  it  was
       assumed the couple were in a genuine relationship.


Rehearing on 20 April 2016

    8. I did not have all the papers that were before the  Judge  as  there
       was no copy of the missing bank statement that  covered  the  period
       from 8 May 2014  to  30  June  2014  whereas  it  had  plainly  been
       submitted with the grounds of appeal as the Judge referred to it.  I
       also did not have a copy of the actual refusal letter.


    9. In the interest of fairness, I stood the matter down for the Sponsor
       to get a further copy of the missing part of the bank statement from
       the bank. Mr Khalid provided me with his copy of part of the refusal
       letter. When the matter was recalled later in the  day  the  Sponsor
       had managed to obtain part of the bank statement. It did not contain
       any deposits or balance. She told me that the bank official had told
       her that a full copy of the statement with the  missing  information
       would take 2 or 3 days to be produced.


   10. In the interest of fairness, and having  considered  submissions,  I
       decided to adjourn the hearing  to  enable  this  crucial  piece  of
       corroborative evidence to be  produced,  the  original  having  been
       provided  with  the  grounds  of  appeal  but  having   subsequently
       disappeared. The evidence  was  readily  obtainable,  likely  to  be
       determinative, and the delay is brief as compared to the  almost  18
       months since the original refusal.

Rehearing 6 June 2016


   11. When the matter was relisted before me, the  missing  bank  document
       was produced. Mrs Peterson conceded that the relevant  documentation
       was now in order, the Entry Clearance Officer should have  exercised
       her discretion to ask for the missing document from the series to be
       produced, and that was a breach of policy.  She  conceded  that  the
       appeal should be allowed.
   12. I agree with Mrs Peterson and will not simply repeat what she  said.
       The missing page from the bank  statement  was  submitted  with  the
       appeal, should have been considered by the Entry Clearance  Manager,
       and the application should then have been  allowed.  The  Appeal  is
       allowed as the relevant documents clearly show that at all times the
       financial thresholds were met and, had the Respondent  followed  her
       own policy, that would have become clear.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

    I allow the Appellant's substantive appeal.
