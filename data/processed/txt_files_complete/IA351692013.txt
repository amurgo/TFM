                         Miss Sheryll Jennifer Brown
                                                                  Respondent



 For the Appellant:        Mr S. Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
 For the Respondent:       Mr G. Davison, counsel, instructed by AJA
                        Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent is a citizen of Jamaica who was born on 14 July 1970.
       She is now 44 years old. The immigration history is  succinctly  set
       out in paragraph 23 of  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Eban, promulgated on 20 May 2014 which is  challenged  by  the
       Secretary of State, as the appellant in this appeal. For the sake of
       continuity, I shall refer to Miss Brown as the appellant, as she was
       before the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. In sub-paragraph (4) of her findings in paragraph 23, the First-tier
       Tribunal Judge found that the appellant's  presence  in  the  United
       Kingdom was indispensable to the well-being of her 93-year-old great-
       uncle, Mr Brown. She found that without the appellant's  assistance,
       he would probably have to go into a nursing home  because,  although
       care assistance was provided to him from social services this  would
       in all probability amount to no more than a few hours a  day.  (This
       is  not  entirely  surprising  since,  and  with  her  presence,  no
       additional care is necessary. That is not  to  say  additional  care
       would not be made available were she to be removed.) The  effect  of
       her departure from the United Kingdom would sever  the  relationship
       as he would not be able to return with her to Jamaica.


    3. In paragraph 24 of her determination, the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
       mentioned that the care  provided  for  her  elderly  relatives  was
       exceptional, her devotion to Mr Brown was mentioned by  all  of  the
       witnesses, no paid care would do as much as she did for him and that
       her support enabled  him  to  have  some  independence  in  his  own
       accommodation.


    4. These findings are not challenged in the grounds  of  appeal  before
       me. It is well arguable that they might have  been,  but  they  were
       not.

    5.  In  addition,  the  Judge  considered  the  relationship  that  the
       appellant  had  developed  with  Mr  Polius  since  2008  which  the
       appellant hoped  would  lead  to  marriage.  The  Judge  recited  in
       paragraph 23, subparagraphs  (7)  to  (9)  that  Mr  Polius  has  no
       connection to Jamaica and would not accompany the appellant were she
       to be returned there. He could not easily afford the cost of  travel
       to Jamaica and, without apparently submitting medical evidence, told
       the Judge that he believed his health would not stand long  distance
       travel. The Judge noted that, were she to apply as  a  fiancï¿½e,  the
       Judge found it was likely that  her  application  would  be  refused
       because of what she described as her appalling  immigration  history
       but that can hardly be a reason why it would be disproportionate  to
       remove her given her immigration history was  entirely  of  her  own
       making.


    6.  In  paragraph  24  of  her  determination,  the  Judge   considered
       collectively the close and genuine bond that the appellant had  both
       with Mr Polius and Mr  Brown,  her  great-uncle,  and  that  it  was
       therefore disproportional and to remove her.

    7. In paragraph 3 of the grounds,  the  Secretary  of  State  correctly
       identified the fact that the relationship with Mr Polius, with  whom
       she does not live, fell  well  short  of  the  sort  of  exceptional
       circumstances that might merit  a  departure  from  the  Immigration
       Rules  and,  in  particular,   the   Secretary   of   State's   (and
       Parliament's) approach to Article 8  as  articulated  in  them.  The
       challenge is well made.


    8. The difficulty, however, is  that  the  grounds  of  appeal  do  not
       challenge the Judge's findings in relation to the  appellant's  role
       as a carer's to her great-uncle, Mr Brown.  He  had  given  evidence
       that he had no help from social services and was entitled  to  none,
       unless he paid for it. She recorded his evidence in paragraph 10  of
       the determination. The  Judge  made  a  finding  of  fact  that  the
       appellant's care for her elderly relatives, by which she included Mr
       Brown's wife who had died during the previous year, was exceptional.
       I do not regard that it is permissible for me to distinguish between
       the Judge's description as her  care  being  'exceptional'  and  the
       exceptionality test that has  now  found  its  place  in  justifying
       whether there should be a departure from the Immigration Rules.

    9. In paragraph 4 of the  grounds,  it  is  said  that  the  Article  8
       assessment  should  only  be  carried  when  there  are   compelling
       circumstances not recognised by the Rules. Using what appears to  be
       a pro forma paragraph, it is said that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
       did not  identify  such  compelling  or  exceptional  circumstances.
       However, whether the Secretary of State agrees or disagrees with it,
       the Judge did find there were exceptional circumstances in  relation
       to her care for Mr Brown. It is not  assisted  by  the  respondent's
       stating that exceptional circumstances means that refusal would lead
       to an unjustifiably harsh result because this is precisely what  the
       Judge found.


   10. For these reasons, I am satisfied that there is no legitimate  means
       by which the grounds of appeal can be construed as  a  challenge  to
       the Judge's assessment of exceptionality in relation to Mr Brown and
       this is sufficient to render the determination  legally  sustainable
       notwithstanding the obvious error in relation to her approach to the
       relationship between the appellant and Mr Polius.

   11. I am not persuaded that the grounds of appeal properly permit it  to
       be argued that her error in relation to the evidence  of  Mr  Polius
       has skewed her overall assessment  of  the  proportionality  balance
       requiring the determination to be re-made. Were the Tribunal  tasked
       with re-making the decision,  it  would  be  bound  by  unchallenged
       findings of fact and the findings of fact that her role as the carer
       of Mr Brown was exceptional would be the starting-point  from  which
       the re-making of the decision would proceed. In such  circumstances,
       I see little prospect of the Upper  Tribunal  reaching  a  different
       conclusion on proportionality given that starting-point.


DECISION

         The grounds of appeal fail to establish the Judge made an error on
         a point of law and the original determination of the appeal shall
         stand.
