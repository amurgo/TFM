For the Appellant:     Ms Rutherford of Counsel instructed by One

For the Respondent:    Ms Aboni, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Khawar promulgated on 20 October 2017 in which he dismissed the  appeal
    of the Appellant against a refusal of entry clearance.


2.   The Appellant is a citizen  of  India  born  on  2  January  1984.   He
    applied for entry clearance as the spouse of Ms Palvinder Kaur (date of
    birth 15 July 1989), an Indian national living in  the  United  Kingdom
    with indefinite leave to remain.  The  Appellant  had  previously  been
    present in the United Kingdom for a considerable period  of  time,  and
    shortly before his departure from the  UK  had  undergone  a  religious
    marriage ceremony with Ms Kaur on 12 December  2015.   He  returned  to
    India and made an application for entry clearance from there.


3.   The application for entry clearance was refused for reasons set out  in
    a  Notice  of  Immigration  Decision  dated  1  December   2016.    The
    application was refused with reference to the financial requirements of
    Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules,  and  also  with  reference  to
    paragraph 320(11) of the  Rules  by  reason  of  the  Appellant's  poor
    immigration history (the details of which are set out on  the  face  of
    the  Notice  of  Immigration  Decision).   So  far  as  the   financial
    requirements are concerned the Respondent was not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant's sponsoring spouse satisfied the requirements of  the  Rules
    essentially for the following reasons:


         "You state in your application that your sponsor  is  employed  and
         that her income is �22,100 per annum as a supervisor  with  Classic
         India Ltd.  I  note  the  following  discrepancies  regarding  your
         sponsor's employment:


         .    Your  sponsor's  employer's  online  account  state  that  the
             business holds cash of �1,204.  In interview  you  state  your
             sponsor supervises 35 employees of this business.   I  do  not
             find it credible that this business is  able  to  employ  your
             sponsor to the amount of �22,100 per annum  or  to  employ  35
             additional members of staff.


         .    Your sponsor's pay slips list the payment method as  a  credit
             transfer, while the deposits to your sponsor's  bank  accounts
             are actually cheques.


         .    On occasions in your sponsor's bank  statement  she  has  paid
             three to four times instead of once.


         .    Payslip dated 13/08/16 to the amount  of  �347.29  arrives  in
             your sponsor's account  on  18/08/16  and  to  the  amount  of
             �347.49 despite the payment method being cheque.


         .    Payslip dated 16/07/16 to the amount  of  �347.29  arrives  in
             your sponsor's account  on  18/08/16  and  to  the  amount  of
             �347.49 despite the payment method being cheque.


             Payslip dated 02/07/16 to the amount of �347.49 arrives to the
             amount of �347.29, despite the payment  method  being  cheque.




         .    Payslip dated 25/06/16 to the amount  of  �347.29  arrives  in
             your sponsor's account  on  27/06/16  and  to  the  amount  of
             �347.49 despite the payment method being cheque.


             Payslip dated 04/06/16 to the amount  of  �347.49  arrives  in
             your sponsor's account  on  06/06/16  and  to  the  amount  of
             �347.29 despite the payment method being cheque.


         .    Payslip dated 28/05/16 to the amount  of  �347.29  arrives  in
             your sponsor's account  on  31/05/16  and  to  the  amount  of
             �347.49 despite the payment method being cheque.


         .    Payslip dated 07/05/16 to the amount  of  �347.49  arrives  in
             your sponsor's account  on  10/05/16  and  to  the  amount  of
             �347.29 despite the payment method being cheque."


4.   The Notice of Immigration Decision also gave consideration  to  Article
    8 of the ECHR,  but  considered  that  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance was proportionate in all the circumstances.


5.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC on human rights grounds.


6.   Before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  issue  in  respect  of  paragraph
    320(11) of  the  Immigration  Rules  was  conceded  by  the  Presenting
    Officer.  Accordingly the live issue before the First-tier Tribunal was
    in respect of the financial requirements of the Rules.   This  was  the
    case even though the appeal was based on human rights grounds because -
    as is apparent from the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge - the
    Appellant essentially put his case on the basis that because he met the
    requirements of  the  Rules  it  would  constitute  a  disproportionate
    interference with the mutual family life enjoyed with  his  partner  to
    refuse to allow him to join her in the UK: e.g. see paragraph 37 of the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


7.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge  found  against  the  Appellant  on  this
    point.  In doing so it is apparent that the Judge had consideration  to
    each of  the  various  bullet  points  in  the  Notice  of  Immigration
    Decision, and in respect of some of them found that the Respondent  had
    not made good his case.  Nonetheless, the Judge was concerned about the
    pattern of payments to Ms Kaur from her supposed employer,  both  prior
    to the date of decision and as revealed in evidence that post-dated the
    decision that  was  filed  in  support  of  the  appeal.   The  Judge's
    conclusion on this issue is summarised at paragraph 32 of the  decision
    in these terms:


         "However, on the above evidence ... I am  not  satisfied  that  the
         Appellant has discharged the burden of proof upon him to  establish
         that the Sponsor is in full-time employment and  genuinely  earning
         her claimed salary of  �22,100  per  annum.   In  my  judgment  the
         frequency of credits made to the sponsor's  bank  account  are  not
         consistent with  an  individual  receiving  weekly  income  in  the
         ordinary  course  of  events  within  a  normal   employer/employee
         relationship.  No explanation is provided either by the sponsor  or
         the employer as to why the sponsor continues to receive credits  of
         alleged income into her Bank account which do not follow the normal
         weekly pattern reasonably to  be  expected  from  a  weekly  income
         despite the fact that since  January  2017  the  appellants  [sic.]
         income  is  received  by  a  bank  transfer.   There  is  also   no
         explanation for withdrawal of large sums of cash from the  sponsors
         account at or about the same time as alleged income  credits  being
         made to her account. Therefore on the totality of evidence I'm  not
         satisfied that the appellant has discharged  the  burden  of  proof
         upon him to establish that the sponsor is  genuinely  employed  and
         earning �22,100 per annum.  I am not satisfied  the  Appellant  has
         discharged the burden of proof to establish he meets the  financial
         requirements of Appendix FM".


8.    Having  reached  this  conclusion  in   respect   of   the   financial
    requirements - which as I say  was  the  key  live  issue  between  the
    parties once the  issue  in  respect  of  paragraph  320(11)  had  been
    conceded - the Judge went on to make some observations  in  respect  of
    the status  of  the  Appellant's  marriage  under  the  heading  'Legal
    Recognition of Marriage' (paragraphs 33-36).


9.   The Judge noted that the religious ceremony  conducted  in  the  United
    Kingdom prior to the Appellant's departure for  India  would  not  have
    been recognised as a valid marriage within the UK, having been confined
    to a religious ceremony and there not having  been  a  duly  registered
    civil ceremony in the UK.  The Judge also gave  some  consideration  to
    whether in the alternative the Appellant could satisfy  the  definition
    of 'partner' by reference to a period of cohabitation akin to  marriage
    but found that the evidence did  not  support  this.   Accordingly  the
    Judge took the view that, irrespective of the position in  relation  to
    the financial requirements, "the Appellant cannot possibly  succeed  in
    this appeal as his marriage is not legally  recognised  in  the  United
    Kingdom" (paragraph 35).


10.  The Judge notes  at  paragraph  36  that  consideration  was  given  to
    reconstituting the hearing in order to hear submissions on this point -
    which it was acknowledged had not formed any basis of the  Respondent's
    refusal decision.  The Judge - it seems to  me  understandably  in  the
    circumstances and context of his other findings - took  the  view  that
    little would be achieved by reconvening the  hearing  when  the  appeal
    fell to be refused with reference to the financial requirements in  any
    event.  Accordingly  the  Judge  dismissed  the  appeal  on  Article  8
    grounds.


11.  The Appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Permission was refused in the first  instance  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Parkes on 4 December 2017, but was subsequently granted by Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge McGeachy on 25 January 2018.


12.  I  am  grateful  to  the  helpful  and  realistic  way  in  which  both
    representatives dealt with the issues before me today.   In  particular
    in due course Ms Aboni offered no meaningful resistance to  the  appeal
    for reasons that I will explain in due course.


13.  I have set out above the Judge's summary of the reasons  for  rejecting
    the Appellant's case with reference to the  financial  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.  Essentially paragraph 32  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision sets out three  strands  of  reasoning.   The  first  two  are
    interrelated and are in respect of  the  frequency  of  credits  to  Ms
    Kaur's bank account - whether sourced from cheques  received  from  her
    employer  or  later  by  bank  transfers.   The   third   'strand'   is
    freestanding: it relates to the apparent withdrawal of  large  sums  of
    cash from the Ms Kaur's account at or about  the  time  of  the  income
    credits being made.  The Judge's comment in this regard at paragraph 32
    is 'picking up' from the Judge's observation at paragraph 30:


         "In addition closer examination  of  the  Sponsor's  bank  accounts
         reveals large cash sums being withdrawn from her bank account at or
         about the same time or within a few  days  of  the  alleged  income
         being credited to her account.  This raises the spectre of the same
         funds simply being re-circulated.  No explanations  were  proffered
         for the large sums of money being withdrawn during this appeal".


14.  It is pleaded in the grounds of  challenge  that  this  point  was  not
    raised during the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.  Indeed
    I can identify nothing in the Record of Proceedings that suggests  that
    any questions were put by either the representatives or the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge seeking explanation or clarification as  to  withdrawals
    from Ms Kaur's bank account.  The focus of the questioning of  Ms  Kaur
    at the hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  in  respect  of
    discrepancies in the methods of payment, the supporting  evidence  from
    the employer, and the irregular frequency of payments of  credits  into
    her account.  Ms Aboni, who has had the opportunity  of  reviewing  the
    notes of the Respondent's  Presenting  Officer  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, confirms that she can identify nothing in  those  notes  that
    might suggest that the Presenting Officer raised any  issue,  or  asked
    any questions about, this point. Nor can I see anything in the  Judge's
    Record of Proceedings to suggest that either party made any submissions
    on this issue.  In the circumstances it would appear to be a matter  of
    which the Judge probably became cognisant upon "closer examination"  of
    the Ms Kaur's bank accounts after the hearing -  and  therefore  not  a
    matter in respect of which there was any exploration, or in respect  of
    which Ms Kaur was invited to offer an explanation.


15.  It is clear from paragraph 32 that this factor  in  the  appeal  was  a
    material element in the overall consideration of the credibility of the
    Ms Kaur's claim to be employed on a salary of �22,100.  It seems to  me
    that that means that the evaluation of the financial circumstances  was
    reached in breach of natural justice, and that the  breach  of  natural
    justice was material to the overall assessment.


16.  This leaves the issue in relation to the legal status of  the  marriage
    - which the Judge expressly acknowledged had not  been  raised  by  the
    Respondent, and had necessarily not been a matter of discussion  during
    the course of the hearing.  In this regard the Appellant has  responded
    by saying that although he had indeed undergone a religious ceremony in
    the UK before leaving (which in and of itself might not be a recognised
    valid marriage in the UK), he had subsequently after  return  to  India
    registered his marriage with the usual officials in the  government  of
    Rajasthan.  In  this  context,  in  support  of  the  application   for
    permission  to  appeal,  he   submitted   his   marriage   registration
    certificate which does indeed indicate that both he  and  Ms  Kaur  had
    their marriage registered  on  10  November  2016  shortly  before  the
    application for entry clearance.


17.  Ms Aboni  has  not  sought  to  make  any  issue  of  this,  and  fully
    acknowledges that the Entry Clearance Officer did not raise this issue.
    She made it clear that the concern of the Respondent was in respect  of
    the financial requirements not the status of the  relationship  between
    the Appellant and Ms Kaur.


18.  Accordingly the Judge's assessment as to the status of the marriage  is
    not such that would provide an alternative basis to permit his decision
    to stand.


19.  In the circumstances I find material error of law  and  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal.


20.  The 'live' issue that remains in  these  proceedings  is  that  of  the
    financial circumstances of Ms Kaur.  Although  Ms  Rutherford  attended
    with further evidence no such evidence had been either filed or served.
    Moreover it is  said  that  Ms  Kaur  requires  the  assistance  of  an
    interpreter.  As such it was not possible  to  proceed  to  remake  the
    decision in the appeal today.  In any event because these matters go to
    the  heart  of  credibility  it   was   common   ground   between   the
    representatives that  the  most  appropriate  forum  for  remaking  the
    decision in the appeal is back before the First-tier Tribunal in  front
    of any Judge other than Judge Khawar.  I agree with that suggestion.


21.  It is a matter now for the Appellant to  decide  what  if  any  further
    evidence he wishes to file in support of his appeal, and whether or not
    Ms Kaur wishes to make available her employer as a supporting witness -
    bearing in mind that notwithstanding the error of law the Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  identified  some  concerns  with  respect  to  the
    pattern of receipt of payment  and  irregularities  in  the  supporting
    evidence from the employer that still require  to  be  considered  very
    carefully in evaluating whether the Ms Kaur is genuinely in receipt  of
    the salary claimed.  As regards the withdrawals of sums of cash from Ms
    Kaur's bank account, this will ultimately be a matter for consideration
    by the next judicial decision-maker: suffice to say presently  that  it
    is a matter in respect of which the Appellant and Ms Kaur may  wish  to
    file some further evidence by way of explanation - however  I  make  no
    prescriptive directions as to what evidence should  or  should  not  be
    filed.  General directions will be adequate: it is  a  matter  for  the
    parties to determine what they wish to bring forward in respect of  the
    issues in the appeal.


Notice of Decision

22.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
law and is set aside.


23.  The decision in the appeal  is  to  be  remade  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal by any Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar.


24.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.
