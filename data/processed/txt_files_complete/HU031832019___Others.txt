Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr P Richardson, instructed by Ideal Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This appeal comes before the Upper Tribunal following an error of law
hearing at which I concluded that there were errors of law in the decision
of the First-tier Tribunal which allowed the appellants' appeal against the
Secretary of State's decision of 4 February 2019.

2.   At the hearing on 4 December Mr Richardson raised an issue concerning
the applicability of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Khan [2018]
EWCA Civ 1684.

3.   The matter was adjourned to 12 February 2020 to enable the Secretary
of State to consider her position in light of the submissions made by Mr
Richardson with regard to Khan and in particular the consequence of the
finding of the judge that a plausible explanation concerning the ETS
certificate provided by the appellant had been provided.

4.   I subsequently received a letter dated 10 December 2019 from Mr Melvin
making it clear that it had been decided to invite the Tribunal to
promulgate a short decision allowing the appellants' appeals in line with
Khan.

5.   I consider that this is the most helpful and speedy response and I am
grateful to Mr Melvin and to those whom he consulted for addressing the
matter so swiftly and helpfully.

6.   There is no reason to suppose that the appellants would have any
objection to this course of action, and accordingly, in line with the
suggestion in the Home Office's letter of 10 December 2019, these appeals
are all allowed in line with the decision in Khan.  As a consequence, the
Article 8 appeals of all the parties are successful.



Notice of Decision

These appeals are allowed under Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on
Human Rights.

No anonymity direction is made.
