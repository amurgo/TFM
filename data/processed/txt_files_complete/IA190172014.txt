For the Appellant:     No attendance
For the Respondent:    Ms Everett Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, Mr Ghulam Raza, date of birth 5th May 1984, is a citizen
    of Pakistan.  I have considered whether or not  is  it  appropriate  to
    make an anonymity direction. Taking all the circumstances into  account
    I do not make such a direction.

 2. There was no attendance by the Appellant. His  representatives  had  by
    fax/e-mail written to the Tribunal on the 23rd  February  2015  stating
    that they were without instructions. They were applying to be taken off
    the record and stated that they would not be attending.  There  was  no
    explanation for the non-attendance of the Appellant.

 3. The Notice of Hearing had gone out to the Appellant in accordance  with
    the Rules. I decided in the circumstances it was  just  and  proper  to
    proceed with the hearing in the Appellant's absence.

 4. The Appellant is appealing against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cockrill promulgated on 7th November 2014.  By that determination
    Judge Cockrill dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the decision of
    the Respondent to refuse the Appellant a residence card as evidence  of
    a right to reside as the spouse of an EEA  national  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom.

Factual Background

 5. On 25th May 2012 the Appellant had applied  for  and  was  subsequently
    granted leave to remain as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student.   Leave  was
    granted on 10th August 2012.  However, by 12th February 2013 that leave
    was revoked.

 6. By application dated 10th  March  2014  the  Appellant  applied  for  a
    residence card as the spouse of an EU national, the EU  national  being
    Miss Barbara Herkt.  However, the Appellant  was  then  encountered  by
    enforcement officers on 24th March 2014 at  Weybridge  Registry  Office
    seeking to enter into  the  marriage  with  Miss  Herkt.  It  therefore
    appears that at the time of the  application  they  were  not  in  fact
    married.

 7. The application for a residence card was then refused by decision dated
    the 21st March 2014. The Appellant appealed against that  decision  and
    the appeal was considered by Judge Cockrill on Monday 3rd November.  On
    3rd November nobody attended.

 8. It appears that a letter had been sent to the Tribunal  on  the  Friday
    before, the hearing being on  the  Monday,  requesting  that  the  oral
    hearing be converted to a paper hearing and that further time be  given
    for submission of further documents to support  the  Appellant's  case.
    Given that the application was within 24 working hours of  the  hearing
    it should have been obvious  that  there  was  no  guarantee  that  the
    application would be granted  and  it  was  necessary  for  either  the
    Appellant or his representatives to attend and make the application  at
    the hearing itself.  No one attended the hearing.

 9. It has to be noted that the  solicitors  had  in  point  of  fact  been
    instructed as of May 2014  because  they  had  submitted  a  bundle  of
    documents at that time. Yet they were requesting some six months  later
    further time to be able to submit  further  documents.   They  had  had
    ample time to put the case in order but had not done so.

10. There  was  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the  judge  would  grant  an
    application to adjourn.  The judge  considered  the  matter  and  heard
    submissions from the Respondent, as he was obliged to do.  It  must  be
    remembered that that are two parties to these proceedings, and just  as
    much as the Appellant is entitled to have a proper hearing, it is  also
    right that the Respondent  be  entitled  to  a  swift  and  expeditious
    consideration of such appeals. The Respondent clearly wanted the matter
    to be determined. The judge therefore determined to  proceed  with  the
    hearing on the basis of the evidence thus far lodged.

11. According to the representations by the Appellant's  representative,  a
    bundle of documents had been faxed on 3rd  November  to  the  court  at
    10.59 a.m.  It appears that that bundle of documents was  never  served
    on the Respondent.  The evidence that they relied on was never provided
    to the Respondent and therefore the judge in  receiving  the  documents
    subsequent to the hearing was dealing with evidence that had  not  been
    provided to the Respondent.

12. Even if one were to look at the evidence  that  had  been  subsequently
    submitted, there is a statement from the Appellant which indicates that
    Ms Herkt, with whom he had been in  a  relationship  and  whom  he  was
    allegedly marrying, no longer wished to be associated with him  and  he
    could no longer contact her.  Therefore the relationship does not  seem
    to have been subsisting at the time of the additional statement to  the
    Tribunal.

13. That seems to be consistent with the account given  by  Ms  Herkt  when
    interviewed after Weybridge Registry Office in which  she  stated  that
    she had only agreed to the marriage because she was being  paid  ï¿½2,500
    in money and she did not really know the Appellant.   She  stated  that
    she lived in Yorkshire with her boyfriend and not with the Appellant in
    Slough.

14. There was a verbal agreement that  she  would  be  paid  and  the  lady
    therefore clearly was very troubled by the fact that the nature of  her
    marriage had been discovered. The facts  as  admitted  by  her  clearly
    established that this was not a genuine marriage.

15. If one examines the statement by the Appellant it  does  indicate  that
    the relationship is subsisting.  The  marriage  has  not  taken  place.
    Whatever can be said, there is  no  marriage,  there  is  therefore  no
    relationship of the Appellant to an EEA national, even on the  evidence
    as presented.

16. However, I am not dealing with the matter on that  basis.   I  have  to
    consider whether or not the judge was right not to adjourn  the  matter
    and not to direct that the matter to be dealt with by a paper  hearing.
    Within the documentation the solicitors  not  only  were  requesting  a
    paper hearing but requesting that new directions be given.   There  was
    no guarantee that the judge would agree to the matter  being  converted
    to a paper hearing.  The  matter had been listed for  an  oral  hearing
    and the judge was perfectly entitled to proceed with the  oral  hearing
    in all the circumstances. It was necessary for the Appellant to  attend
    or his  representatives  to  make  a  proper  application  and  give  a
    justifiable reason why the oral hearing should not go ahead. There  was
    no need for further directions.  The Appellant and  his  representative
    had had ample opportunity to put  all  the  documents  they  needed  to
    support the case to show that this was a genuine  marriage  and  not  a
    marriage of convenience.  No such documents have been put forward.

17. Indeed, the new documentation including the statement supports the view
    that the marriage was indeed merely a marriage of convenience.

18. Further to that, there was  absolutely  no  evidence  that  Ms  Barbara
    Herkt, was in  fact  working.  There  was  no  evidence  that  she  was
    exercising treaty rights. The judge comments on that in paragraph 31 of
    the determination.

19. The judge does indicate in paragraph 20 that he has considered all  the
    documents submitted and in paragraph 31  that  he  has  considered  the
    documents on behalf of  the  Appellant  submitted  by  the  solicitors.
    There was nothing even in the new bundle which would indicate that  the
    findings by the judge were wrong in law.

20. If  one  looks  therefore  at  the  situation  the  Appellant  and  the
    Appellant's representative could not presume that an adjournment  would
    be granted.  It was for them to  attend  in  order  to  make  a  proper
    application.  They did not. The judge was entitled to proceed with  the
    hearing and to determine it on the  basis  of  the  evidence  that  was
    before him. Even if the additional evidence should have been considered
    and was not, which I am satisfied that  there  is  nothing  within  the
    additional evidence which brings into question  the  findings  of  fact
    made by the judge.

21. The judge was perfectly entitled to conclude that it  had  been  proved
    that this was a marriage of convenience and that there was no  evidence
    in any event that the sponsoring EEA national was in point  of  fact  a
    qualified person.  In those circumstances the  judge  was  entitled  to
    come to the conclusion that he did and to dismiss this appeal.  For the
    reasons set out I find that the judge made no material error of law and
    I uphold the decision made on all grounds.
