Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms L Mair, instructed by Pro Legis Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. An application for permission to appeal was made by the Entry Clearance
    Officer but nonetheless for the purposes of this decision I shall refer
    to the parties as they were described before the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    that is Ms Firdous as the appellant.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 30th  October  1985  and
    she applied for entry clearance to visit her brother Khalid  Hameed  in
    the United Kingdom.

 3. Her appeal was refused by the Entry Clearance Officer  on  1st  October
    2013.  The appellant had been employed as a teacher since 2011  with  a
    monthly income of �40.90 and was also supported by her brother  in  the
    UK.  The appellant wished  to  visit  the  UK  at  a  cost  to  herself
    personally of �300 to see her brother, his wife  and  their  two  young
    children.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the appeal on the basis that it was
    not considered she was a genuine visitor or that she  would  return  at
    the close of her visit.

 5. The appellant appealed on the basis of the restricted grounds of appeal
    and human rights on the grounds further  to  Section  84(1)(c)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act to the effect that  she  has  a
    family life with her brother.  Judge Robson heard  the  appeal  on  4th
    July 2014 and allowed the appeal finding at paragraph 42 that:

         "The first issue is whether or not the appellant does  have  family
         life in the  United  Kingdom.   It  is  argued  on  behalf  of  the
         respondent that the family life that the appellant enjoys  is  with
         her mother and indeed reference has been made to the mother and the
         appellant's interdependency.  However I find there is  some  degree
         of family life  being  conducted  between  the  appellant  and  her
         brother which from  the  circumstances  set  out  below  cannot  be
         conducted in Pakistan."

 6. The respondent made an application for  permission  to  appeal  as  the
    judge gave no further reasoning at paragraph 42 as to a  finding  of  a
    family life. Permission to appeal was granted by  First  Tier  Tribunal
    Judge Levin on the basis that the judge's finding that there was family
    life constituted a material error of law as it  was  inconsistent  with
    the judgment in the Court of Appeal in Kugathas v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31and failed to  give  adequate
    reasons.

 7. In the skeleton argument placed before me Ms Mair  submitted  that  the
    line of authorities which included Kugathas and S v UK (1984) 40 DR 196
     were distinguishable because they referred to the family life  between
    adults for the purposes of immigration settlement and in this case  the
    visit was for the  purpose  of  family  visit.   She  argued  that  the
    extended right to family life was recognised in for example the case of
    SB (Pakistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 834  2010  INLR  where  at  paragraph  41
    Aikens LJ stated "the basic  proposition  that  a  person's  family  or
    extended family is the group on which many people most  heavily  depend
    socially, emotionally and often financially".

 8. In addition Ms Mair referred to Singh v ECO New Delhi [2004]  EWCA  Civ
    1075 where Mr Justice Munby at paragraph 58 stated:

         "Thirdly there is the relationship between siblings.  And  fourthly
         there are relationships within the wider family:  for  example  the
         relationships between grandparent and  grandchild,  between  nephew
         and uncle, between cousins.  Each of  these  relationships  can  in
         principle give rise to family life within the  meaning  of  Article
         8."

 9. I find that the key in the above is the word "in principle give rise to
    family life".  There is no doubt that it cannot  be  said  that  family
    life cannot be created between two adult siblings but the sliding scale
    which Ms Mair indicated that I should accept,  suggests  that  where  a
    visit is contemplated a refusal because it is a  short  visit  it  more
    likely to be disproportionate. However the fact  is  that  family  life
    must still be established.

10. Mr Justice Munby at paragraph 72 of  Singh v ECO stated "the Strasbourg
    Court has never sought to identify any minimum requirements  that  must
    be shown if family life is to be held to exist.  That is because  there
    are none".  This however does not  seek  to  establish  a  family  life
    protected right under Article 8 where there is none and each case  must
    be established on the circumstances.

11. Even though the respondent has recognised that there are family  visits
    or a satisfactory family life alternative to residing together  in  the
    same country, that presupposes that there is a family life and that  is
    the question that is being considered in this case before the  question
    of interference or proportionality is considered.

12. In Singh v ECO it was also stated that:

    "The considerations that bear upon the question of whether there  is  a
    family life as between two childless cohabiting adults (perhaps of  the
    same sex) are not the same as those that  bear  upon  the  question  of
    whether there is family life as between say an uncle and his nephew."

13. The argument put forward was that the brother and sponsor last saw  his
    sister in 2011 and that he could not travel  to  Pakistan  to  see  his
    sister with the family because one of his children was autistic and the
    other had emotional and behavioural difficulties.  The fact is that the
    appellant has had very little physical contact with  her  brother  over
    the years, albeit they kept in contact by modern methods,  and  in  her
    own witness  statement  stated  that  she  lives  with  her  mother  in
    Pakistan.  Part of her case was  that  she  would  return  to  Pakistan
    because she did not wish to leave her mother.

14. Kugathas accepted that the family life does  not  need  to  be  centred
    within  the  UK  but  the  genuineness  of  the  family  bond  must  be
    considered.  This is not the case where the sister and the brother have
    been living together for years.  They have not.  There is a  biological
    connection but only a  distant  practical  relationship  between  them.
    Despite the fact that the brother in  the  UK  gives  the  sister  some
    financial  benefit  I  do  not  accept  that   this   can,   in   these
    circumstances,  establish  a  family  life.   The  appellant   in   her
    application form stated that she was fully reliant financially  on  her
    brother but at the same time gave details that she had full  time  work
    as a teacher and earned RS7,000 per month. In her witness statement she
    confirmed that she was line for promotion. Although she  was  diagnosed
    with diabetes she is treated in Pakistan.

15. The sponsor chose to leave Pakistan in 2002 and  his  sister  was  left
    behind and since that time the sister has lived with her mother.   Both
    the appellant and the sponsor  have  effectively  developed  their  own
    family lives in independent units.  There was no  indication  that  the
    children  even  though  they  have  autism  and  emotional  behavioural
    difficulties have established a close bond with the  appellant,  rather
    that what was being denied was the opportunity to develop a  bond,  and
    in these circumstances I cannot see that  the  best  interests  of  the
    children would be effected thereby introducing a  family  life  between
    the appellant, her brother and the children.

16. Indeed in the witness statement of the sponsor  he  states  "being  the
    youngest of the family she is very close to my mother and at the outset
    she was reluctant to come for a visit as this would  mean  leaving  our
    mother".  This does not suggest a family life with the sponsor.  I  can
    accept that taking  family  of  six  to  see  the  appellant  would  be
    expensive and travelling with an autistic child would be difficult  but
    having found that there is no family life which is protected by Article
    8, I am not persuaded that the  question  of  interference  comes  into
    play. Even if it did there are modern means  of  communication  through
    which the appellant and her brother can communicate.  I note  that  the
    notice of appeal was sent out in August and at the date of the decision
    the sponsor was in Pakistan.  It  is  therefore  possible  for  him  to
    maintain his links with the appellant.

17. It is suggested that modern means of communication are unsuitable given
    the communication difficulties of the children but I find that there is
    no family life between the appellant and her nephews with whom she  has
    had very  limited  contact  and  certainly  no  economic  or  emotional
    dependence.  There is I accept a biological link between them but  this
    does not create family  life  in  and  of  itself.   I  considered  the
    psychological report on Shujah, one of the nephews, and have considered
    the children's best interests.  First, I do not find the children  will
    be affected because they are young, have not lived with  the  appellant
    and their interests lie with the mother and family with whom they live.
    Secondly, no report was produced with regard Wahab who  was  stated  to
    have autism, and thus no confirmation that  he  could  not  communicate
    with his aunt with the assistance of  his  parents.    Further,  Shujah
    attends  mainstream  primary  school   and   thus   his   communication
    difficulties, particularly on reading the report produced, are not such
    that he would be unable to communicate via skype or telephone.  Thirdly
    the skeleton argument presented the case that the  children  could  not
    travel.   The psychological report from The City of Bradford Children's
    Services dated  December  2013,  referred  to  concerns  over  Shujah's
    development and, it stated, owing to 'extended leave  in  Pakistan  his
    attendance was poor'.

18. For the above  reasons  I  do  not  find  that  family  life  has  been
    established, that any interference by the refusal has  consequences  of
    such  gravity  and  further  I   find   that   the   refusal   is   not
    disproportionate as it is clear that the  family  connection  is  being
    continued by sporadic family visits from the sponsor's family

19. At the hearing before me I invited further evidence on the  basis  that
    an error of law was found and was asked by Ms Mair    to  preserve  the
    findings of Judge Robson.  I find that the judge has  materially  erred
    in law in finding that family life existed when he had not  had  regard
    to the relevant law and further gave  inadequate  reasons  for  finding
    that the respondent's decision was of sufficient gravity to potentially
    engage Article 8.  I find there was an error  in  the  decision  and  I
    preserve the first two sentences of paragraph 47 of  the  determination
    of Judge Robson only with reference to  the  sponsor's  oral  evidence.
    For the reasons given above I dismiss the appeal on the basis that  the
    appellant has not established any protected right to family  life  with
    which the respondent can interfere, that any interference if there  was
    family life is proportionate.  I therefore set aside  the  decision  of
    Judge Robson.  I remake the decision and refuse the appeal.


Order

The appellant's appeal is dismissed on Article 8 grounds.
