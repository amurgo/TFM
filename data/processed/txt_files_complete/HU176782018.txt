                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
 1. I have considered whether any parties  require  the  protection  of  an
    anonymity direction. No anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
    respect of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and
    evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
 2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this  appeal  but
    in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in
    the First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State
    against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Cole, promulgated on  9
    June 2019 which allowed the Appellant's appeal against the refusal of a
    human rights claim.

Background
 3. The Appellant was born on 14  September  1989  and  is  a  national  of
    Pakistan.
 4. On 3 April 2018 the Appellant applied for entry clearance as a  Spouse.
    In that application the Appellant claimed that his wife,  the  Sponsor,
    earned �14,000 and therefore did not  meet  the  minimum  threshold  of
    �18,600 but argued that the criteria under Appendix FM Gen 3.1  applied
    that refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  the
    applicant, his partner and child and therefore third party support from
    the Sponsors father could be considered and the minimum threshold would
    be met.
 5. On 22  July  2018  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  Appellant's
    application. The refusal letter gave a number of reasons:
      a) The payslips provided for the period 4.10. 2017- 4.4.2018  from  GI
         Group showed and annual income of �11,504.47.
      b) No evidence  of  exceptional  circumstances  allowing  third  party
         funding to be considered was shown.
 6. Grounds of appeal were lodged arguing that:
      a) The Judge failed to reconcile inconsistencies as  to  the  Sponsors
         income in determining whether the income threshold was met.
      b) The Judges findings at paragraphs 40-43 are unclear given that they
         start by stating that the income earned by  the  Sponsor  was,  not
         particularly clear.' But then go on to find that the minimum income
         threshold was met.
      c) The proportionality assessment was inadequate.
 7. On 9 July 2019 Upper Tribunal Judge Keith  gave  permission  to  appeal
    stating
 8. At the hearing I heard submissions from Mr McVitie  on  behalf  of  the
    Respondent that:
      a) The Judge had very confused evidence before him as to the  Sponsors
         income at the time of the hearing which he failed to reconcile.
      b) The Sponsor produced a P60 for  2018-2019  which  contradicted  the
         Appellants oral evidence as to  her  income  at  the  time  of  the
         hearing but the Judge simply ignored it which was perverse.
      c) The Judge made a finding at  paragraph  42  that  the  Sponsor  was
         earning �14,000 per annum but  failed  to  make  clear,  given  the
         contradictory evidence, before him where  he  derived  that  figure
         from.
      d) The proportionality assessment must be flawed if the minimum income
         threshold was not met.
 9. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Holt submitted that:
      a) The Judge accepted what  the  Appellant  said  her  earnings  being
         �14,000 per year.
      b) The problem was that the P60 appeared to contradict this.
      c) However  the  Sponsor  was  not  challenged  about  this  in  cross
         examination and to raise that as a discrepancy without  giving  the
         Appellant the opportunity to address the issue in cross examination
         would have been procedurally unfair.
      d) The Sponsor was now working different hours  at  the  time  of  the
         hearing and therefore there was a  difference  between  the  income
         claimed then and now but this was not specifically  raised  in  the
         grounds.
10. In reply Mr McVitie on behalf of the Respondent submitted that
      a) The P60 was relied on at the hearing by the Appellant.

Finding on Material Error
11. Having heard those  submissions  I  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    Tribunal made no material errors of law.
12. This was a human rights appeal as it was a refusal of  entry  clearance
    to a spouse who had applied to join his wife and child in  the  UK.  As
    stated at paragraph 34 of TZ and PG [2018] EWCA Civ 1109

         "where a person satisfies the Rules, whether or not by reference to
         an article 8 informed requirement, then  this  will  be  positively
         determinative of that person's article  8  appeal,  provided  their
         case engages article 8(1), for the very reason that it  would  then
         be disproportionate for that person to be removed."
13. The Judge in this case was therefore required to make clear findings as
    to whether the Appellant met the income requirements of the Rules  when
    her income and that of her father were combined because if she did then
    her application should have been granted and to refuse her  application
    would be disproportionate. It was accepted that the Appellant could not
    meet the income requirements by reference to the Sponsors income  alone
    and that income was set out in the refusal letter as  �11504.47.  There
    was no dispute in the refusal letter that  she  had  not  provided  the
    mandatory evidence to show that this income was received in the form of
    pay slips and bank statements simply that  her  income  alone  had  not
    reached  the  threshold  of  �18,600.  Had  the  Respondent  wished  to
    challenge that evidence by reference to Appendix FM-SE  it  would  have
    been open to him to do so in the refusal letter and it would have  been
    open to the Judge, particularly given the Appellant  was  unrepresented
    to establish at the start of the hearing that  the  Appellant  was  not
    required to prove this again.
14.  The Judge's decision to find that there were circumstances  justifying
    consideration of third party  support  has  not  been  challenged.  The
    evidence of the income available at the time of application by  way  of
    third party support set out at paragraph 35 and supported by clear  and
    consistent documentary evidence was  that  the  Sponsors  father  could
    afford to provide �9,100 per annum and therefore  the  Sponsor  had  to
    demonstrate that her earnings at the time of the  application  were  at
    least �9,500 which was accepted in the refusal letter.
15. The Judges findings as to the Sponsors income are set out at paragraphs
    39 onwards. These were arguably  unnecessary  given  what  was  in  the
    refusal letter but any erroring re opening the issue was  not  material
    given  his  conclusion.   While  he  does  not  explicitly  refer   the
    �11,504.77 accepted in the refusal letter he  states  at  paragraph  42
    that the Sponsor 'earns in excess of �9500' which was enough to satisfy
    the requirements of the Rules. While he went on the look at the  income
    at the time of the hearing I am satisfied that he was not  required  to
    make findings about that as he had determined that  the  Appellant  met
    the Rules at the date of  application  and  therefore  the  application
    should have been granted. Given that the P60 related  to  the  Sponsors
    income at the time of the hearing I am satisfied that any deficiency of
    findings in relation to that were not material to the issues he had  to
    determine.
16. I take into account what was said by the Court of Appeal in MD (Turkey)
    [2017] EWCA Civ 1958 at paragraph 26:

         "The duty to give reasons requires that  reasons  must  be  proper,
         intelligible and adequate:  see the classic authority of this court
         in Re Poyser and Mills' Arbitration [1964]  2  QB  467.   The  only
         dispute in the present case relates to the last of those  elements,
         that is the adequacy of the  reasons  given  by  the  FtT  for  its
         decision allowing the  appellant's  appeal.   It  is  important  to
         appreciate that adequacy in this context is precisely that, no more
         and no less.  It is not a counsel of perfection.  Still less should
         it provide an opportunity to undertake a qualitative assessment  of
         the reasons to see if they are wanting, perhaps even surprising, on
         their merits.  The purpose of the duty to give reasons is, in part,
         to enable the losing party to know why she has lost.  It is also to
         enable an appellate court or tribunal to see what the  reasons  for
         the decision are so that they can be examined in case some error of
         approach has been committed."
17. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge's determination when read as  a
    whole set out findings that were sustainable and sufficiently  detailed
    and based on cogent reasoning and the findings  he  made  as  to  third
    party support when taken together  with  the  income  accepted  in  the
    refusal letter the minimum income requirements were met.

CONCLUSION
18. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established and  that
    the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION
19. The appeal is dismissed.
