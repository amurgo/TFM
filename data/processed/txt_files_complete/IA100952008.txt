For the Respondent:    Ms C Warren, Counsel instructed by Paragon Law



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal with a substantial history.  We  will  refer  to  the
    present respondent as the claimant because he was the appellant in  the
    proceedings below.

2.   The appellant is a national of Hungary who  has  been  present  in  the
    United Kingdom since October 1986 when he arrived here  with  an  entry
    clearance as a spouse.  He is married to a British citizen and  he  has
    three children born to him who we shall refer to  by  initials,  D  now
    aged 26, S now aged 24 and A now aged 15�.  There is some indication in
    the material before us that the appellant was working until about  2001
    though details of that are somewhat sparse.

3.   The present appeal is an appeal against a decision  made  in  May  2008
    that he be deported on the grounds that his presence was  a  threat  to
    public policy within the meaning of the Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006, Regulation 21.  That decision  was  re-made  on  4  October  2011
    pursuant to directions given earlier that year by a panel.   The  basis
    for the decision was two convictions of the claimant, first  in  August
    2002 he was convicted of conspiracy to contravene Section  170  of  the
    Customs  and  Excise  Management  Act  of  1979  in  relation  to   the
    importation of goods, namely tobacco.  He was sentenced to three years'
    imprisonment in August 2003 and released some fourteen months later  on
    6 October 2003.  At that stage Hungary  had  not  joined  the  European
    Union.  It did so on 1  May  2004  and  the  question  of  whether  the
    appellant could rely upon rights preceding Hungary's membership of  the
    European Union remained a difficult question for some time.

4.   The appellant was subsequently arrested on 26 January 2006 for  another
    conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.  The dates of  that  conspiracy
    go back to 1 September 2005.  The appellant was the first named on  the
    indictment and was considered to be the organiser  of  that  conspiracy
    which again related to importation of tobacco without excise duty being
    paid.  He was eventually sentenced for that on 4 September 2007 when he
    was given, on a plea of guilty, a sentence of four years' imprisonment,
    the judge explaining that if he had contested guilt on that occasion he
    would have adopted a seven year starting point  having  regard  to  his
    role in the enterprise and his previous  conviction  that  was  a  very
    serious aggravating factor.

5.   It is to be noted however that between 3 April 2006 and  5  April  2007
    the appellant left  the  United  Kingdom  when  he  breached  his  bail
    conditions and travelled to Hungary with his wife and youngest child  A
    where he remained for a year before returning pursuant  to  extradition
    request on 5 April 2007.  During that time,  as  it  happens,  the  EEA
    Regulations came into force and for the first  time  those  Regulations
    applied the considerations  of  the  Citizens  Directive  of  2004  and
    distinguished between various levels  of  protection  of  EU  nationals
    depending  upon  whether  they  had  achieved  permanent  residence  or
    residence of ten  years  that  required  their  deportation  to  be  on
    imperative grounds of the public interest.

6.   The appeal was first  heard  on  29  September  2008  at  the  Stafford
    Combined Court when a panel of the then Asylum and Immigration Tribunal
    concluded that the appellant  was  entitled  to  rely  upon  imperative
    grounds and that bad as his conduct  had  been  it  did  not  meet  the
    threshold to justify his deportation on those grounds  and  accordingly
    the appeal was allowed applying the EEA  Regulations.   Reconsideration
    was ordered and on 15 October 2010 the Court of Appeal, by consent, set
    aside that decision and remitted it to the First-tier Tribunal  as  the
    AIT had now become for a de novo hearing.  It is worth  recording  that
    one of the reasons why the court took that decision by consent was that
    it concluded, applying the previous case law of the AIT, that residence
    that had occurred before the claimant had become an EU national because
    Hungary had not yet joined the EU could not be taken into  account  for
    the purpose of considering the ten year period of residence  for  which
    imperative grounds was appropriate.  It is sufficient to note that that
    proposition is now quite clearly no longer a sound one in the light  in
    particular of the decision of the Court  of  Justice  in  the  case  of
    Ziolkowski [2011] EUECJ Case No.C-424/10 of 21 December 2011.

7.   It is further relevant  to  note  in  the  chronology  of  events  that
    between the favourable decision of the AIT and  the  setting  aside  of
    that decision by the Court of Appeal the  claimant  had  to  return  to
    prison for a third time,  on  this  occasion  to  serve  a  three  year
    sentence imposed in August 2010 for failing to pay the sum  ordered  by
    way of asset computation in the sum of something approaching  �900,000.



8.   He then came before the panel of the First-tier Tribunal on  6  October
    2011 when a fresh decision had been taken some two days earlier  before
    ...management directions issued earlier that year and the panel allowed
    his appeal on 28 October 2011.  The Secretary  of  State  appealed  and
    permission to appeal was granted by  Judge  Blandy  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal on 10 November 2011.  Judge Blandy's grant of appeal makes  it
    clear that what he considered was an arguable error by the panel was  a
    failure to balance the interests of the  child  A  against  the  public
    interest in the case.  It does appear that there were two  versions  of
    the grounds of appeal that had been submitted to this Tribunal  by  the
    Secretary of State.  That is unfortunate.  Only one  version  seems  to
    have reached the claimant but having considered the fuller version when
    a different point is taken as to whether the panel has  considered  the
    case in accordance with the Regulations, we concluded  that  there  was
    nothing in that ground that would have justified permission  to  appeal
    in any event so the issues before us are whether the panel has made  an
    error of law in consideration of the factors which caused it  to  allow
    this appeal and if so whether we should re-make the decision.  We would
    only do so if we concluded that any error was material and there was  a
    realistic prospect of a different outcome emerging from a third de novo
    hearing in the light of the up-to-date facts of the case.

9.   Essentially the panel had before it  a  volume  of  material  from  the
    wife, her brother and the children, in particular a  witness  statement
    from the child A who was 14 years 11 months at the date of the hearing.
     He explains how much he missed contact with  his  father,  he  was  at
    school and doing well at school, he had clearly  had  had  difficulties
    with the number of times that his father had been in prison  in  recent
    years and was hoping to enjoy a period  of  stable  family  life.   The
    panel said in terms that they accepted the  witnesses  before  them  as
    credible and did not have any reason to doubt the evidence of the  wife
    and children and the brother-in-law.  We rather assume  that  they  may
    not have intended to encapsulate the  appellant  within  that  generous
    finding because his witness statements ranged over a range  of  topics,
    some of which may well have been capable of dispute.  Nevertheless  the
    panel recognised that this was a case to which the Regulations applied,
    spelt out Regulation 21.5 and its five different components and in  our
    judgment proceeded to assess the evidence in  the  case  in  accordance
    with that Regulation.

10.  At paragraph 17 of its decision the panel noted  that  the  last  OASys
    Report suggested that the appellant was at low risk  of  offending  but
    the Offender Manager Report clearly noted and attached  weight  to  the
    fact that he was an adult who had committed offences for financial gain
    on two occasions and many of the factors which might have  operated  to
    deter him from offending had operated previously.  The panel  concluded
    that the appellant's presence was a risk  to  the  wider  community  at
    paragraph 18 and noticing the sentencing remarks of the judge  in  that
    respect.  Thereafter at  paragraphs  20  through  to  the  end  of  its
    decision they are examining the factors  relevant  to  proportionality,
    including the length of residence, the  family  circumstances  and  the
    impact upon the family of the appellant's  removal.   Not  specifically
    spelt out in Regulation 21 but an important part of  both  public  law,
    human rights law and through those two tracks community law but equally
    independent upon community law is the principle of the  best  interests
    of the child spelt out in Article 3 of the United Nations Convention on
    the Right of the Child but more particularly examined in the well-known
    case of ZH (Tanzania) [2011] UKSC 4.  They noted that  as  regards  the
    wife's position alone she had been willing to relocate to  her  husband
    in Hungary when he had absconded bail and was unlawfully at  large  and
    although she said that she would now  be  unwilling  to  relocate  they
    noted  at  [37]  that  that  did  not  necessarily  mean  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect her to do so.  They did however realise that the
    wife was providing a home to the second child S, aged 24, who now had a
    child of her own and who was having family difficulties.

11.  However, it is clear from  the  structure  of  the  decision  that  the
    factor that they gave weight to was the best interests of the child  A,
    nearly 14 at the time of the decision before them, who was  doing  well
    at school, was British, was integrated into British  society,  who  had
    admittedly spent a year of his  life  out  of  the  United  Kingdom  in
    Hungary but did not speak Hungarian or otherwise know the language  and
    whose best interests, they assessed, would be served by a continuity of
    residence in the United Kingdom.  They said at the start  of  paragraph
    38 the overriding factor however as we have already indicated is in our
    estimation the best interests of A.  That is the factor to  which  they
    attach the greatest weight.

12.  Before us Mr Deller has confined  his  attack  to  that  paragraph,  we
    think sensibly, and points out that it could mean that  the  panel  had
    given decisive weight as a matter of law to those interests which would
    be an error of law since the best interests of a child  are  a  primary
    but not the paramount consideration and they can be outweighed by other
    factors including the serious nature of the  errant  father's  conduct.
    However, the  panel  had  properly  encapsulated  the  learning  in  ZH
    (Tanzania) and Omotunde.  Omotunde was a  criminal  deport  case  which
    might therefore have grappled with these problems in the more  relevant
    context of criminal action by the father and did not make the error  in
    the  earlier  paragraphs  of  assigning  paramount  importance  to  the
    interests of the child.  In those circumstances we think  although  the
    reasoning is a little compressed in the  critical  paragraph  [38]  and
    might have been with advantage unpacked little more in  explaining  why
    the father's removal was considered to be so detrimental to the child's
    interests that it played the critical role in the balance that it  did,
    we think beneficially construed that is what the  panel  were  in  fact
    saying in that decision.  If so, they had not misdirected themselves in
    law in reaching that decision and this Tribunal  should  not  interfere
    with the result at which they had arrived whether or not  that  is  the
    decision which we would have reached if we had been deciding this  case
    for ourselves as a first instance panel.

13.  We understand the Secretary of State's concerns in an  appeal  of  this
    sort as we agree with the panel and the Secretary  of  State  that  the
    father's conduct was serious, persistent,  for  financial  gain  as  an
    adult and organised others in doing.  Those are very weighty matters in
    the public interest.  As against that he has been resident for a  great
    many years, something in the order of 27 years, albeit with a year out,
    and his close family are all based here.  In the  circumstances  we  do
    not have to speculate what the assessment under EU law would have  been
    if a fresh decision were to be made in his case.  We are conscious that
    nearly two years have passed since the panel last looked at it.  EU law
    would require the Secretary of State to make a  further  evaluation  of
    his case in the next month or so to comply with the two year period  of
    review and, in the light of developing  jurisprudence,  it  might  well
    have been considered that now imperative grounds did apply to him which
    is of course what the panel in  2008  decided.   That  however  is  not
    matters that weigh with us in our decision.  We conclude  overall  that
    any defect in the reasoning in  [38]  that  there  may  exist  was  not
    substantial or material and the panel were entitled  to  reach  overall
    the conclusions to which it did.

14.  For those reasons we dismiss the Secretary of State's  appeal  and  the
    decision of the panel will remain.
