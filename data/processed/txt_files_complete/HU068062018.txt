Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Samimi that was promulgated on 8 November 2018.

 2. At the start of the hearing both parties agreed that there had been an
    error of law and submitted that the appeal should be remitted to the
    First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh.  The reason there is agreement
    as to there having been an error of law is that the judge applied a
    version of paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules that had been
    superseded and was not applicable.

 3. I agree with the parties and therefore remit the appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal to be heard afresh before a different judge.

 4. No anonymity direction is made.

Decision

a.   The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
    law and is set aside.

b.   The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh
    before a different judge.
