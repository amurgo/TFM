                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against a decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Caswell promulgated on 10th November 2014.

 2. The Appellant is a male Pakistani citizen born 1st February 1990 who on
    18th November 2013 applied for a residence card on the basis that he is
    the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty rights  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The application was made because the Appellant had married  a
    Czech national, Lucie Kratka (the Sponsor) on 17th October  2013.   The
    Sponsor is exercising treaty rights as a self-employed cleaner.

 3. The application was refused on 2nd June 2014.  In  giving  reasons  for
    refusal the Respondent contended that insufficient  evidence  had  been
    provided to prove that the  Sponsor  was  economically  active  in  the
    United Kingdom as a self-employed person, and it was contended that the
    Appellant and Sponsor had entered into a  marriage of  convenience,  so
    that the Appellant could obtain leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.
    The application was therefore refused with reference to  regulations  2
    and 6 of The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the
    2006 Regulations).

 4. The Appellant appealed, and her appeal was heard by Judge Caswell  (the
    judge) on 4th November 2014.  After hearing evidence from the Appellant
    and Sponsor, the judge concluded that  the  marriage  was  not  one  of
    convenience and therefore the appeal succeeded on that ground.  However
    the judge found that insufficient evidence had been submitted to  prove
    that the Sponsor  was  exercising  treaty  rights  as  a  self-employed
    person, and for that reason the appeal was dismissed.

 5. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    In summary it was contended that the Sponsor had submitted evidence  to
    show that she was exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom.   She
    had provided with the application an advertisement  for  her  business,
    together with a letter from Proacc Associates dated 6th  November  2013
    confirming that she had been self-employed since 13th June 2013 with  a
    weekly income of approximately �210.  The Sponsor  had  also  submitted
    confirmation from HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) dated  5th  October  2013
    confirming  that  the  Sponsor  needed  to   pay   national   insurance
    contributions of �45.90 before 31st January 2014.

 6. It was submitted that at the hearing, new documentary evidence had been
    produced, and the judge had erred  by  not  taking  the  evidence  into
    account.  This new evidence amounted to bank statements, and  a  letter
    from HMRC dated 4th October  2014  confirming  the  national  insurance
    contributions which the Sponsor had to pay before 31st January 2015,  a
    sum of �74.25.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    White who found that it was arguable that the judge had failed to  take
    into account the evidence of  economic  activity  referred  to  in  the
    grounds seeking permission.

 8. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to rule 24 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 contending, in  summary,  that  the  judge  had  directed  herself
    appropriately in considering the treaty rights issue, and  the  grounds
    disclosed a disagreement with the findings made, but did  not  disclose
    an error of law.

 9. The Respondent referred to rule 24(3)(e) of the 2008  Procedure  Rules,
    and contended that the judge had failed to give  adequate  reasons  for
    finding the Appellant and Sponsor to be in a genuine relationship.   It
    was pointed out that there were no witnesses to the genuineness of  the
    relationship at the hearing.  It was also contended that the judge  had
    failed to deal adequately with the Respondent's concerns in relation to
    credibility, taking into account the  Appellant's  adverse  immigration
    history.

10. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal to decide  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision should be set aside.

The Appellant's Submissions

11. Mr Karnik relied upon  Begum  Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  00275  (IAC)  and
    submitted that the Sponsor had  provided  evidence  of  self-employment
    which proved that she was sufficiently economically active so as to  be
    considered as exercising treaty rights.  Mr Karnik submitted that Begum
    proved this was the appropriate test.

12. Reliance was placed by Mr Karnik upon the grounds contained within  the
    application for permission to appeal and I was asked to find  that  the
    judge had erred by failing  to  have  regard  to  material  matters  or
    evidence.  When I asked for clarification as to what  evidence  it  was
    contended the judge had not considered, Mr Karnik explained that he was
    in some difficulty  as  he  had  not  appeared  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He could not categorically state  what  documents  had  been
    placed before the judge at the hearing, but contended  that  the  judge
    had not taken into account the HMRC letter dated 4th October 2014 which
    stated that the Sponsor was due to pay national insurance contributions
    of �74.25 no later than 31st January 2015.

13. In relation to the rule 24 response Mr Karnik submitted that the  judge
    had not erred  in  considering  the  marriage.   The  judge  had  heard
    evidence, and both the Appellant and Sponsor were cross-examined.   The
    issue raised by the Respondent amounted to a disagreement and  did  not
    disclose an error of law.

The Respondent's Submissions

14. Miss Johnstone relied upon the rule 24  response  which  is  dated  6th
    January 2015.  I was asked to find that the  judge  had  not  erred  in
    concluding that the Sponsor had not  proved  that  she  was  exercising
    treaty rights.  The mere fact that national insurance contributions are
    due does not without more mean that an individual is exercising  treaty
    rights as a self-employed person.

15. In relation to the marriage, Miss Johnstone submitted  that  the  judge
    had given inadequate reasons for finding that the  couple  had  entered
    into a genuine and subsisting marriage.

The Appellant's Response

16. Mr Karnik disagreed that the judge had given  inadequate  reasons  when
    finding that the marriage was genuine and subsisting  and  not  one  of
    convenience.  In relation to self-employment I was asked to  note  that
    there were cash deposits into the Sponsor's bank  account,  which  were
    commensurate with self-employed income.

17. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

18. I do not find that the judge erred  in  law,  in  concluding  that  the
    Sponsor had not proved that she was exercising treaty rights as a self-
    employed person.

19. It is contended that the judge did not take into account evidence  that
    was submitted with the application, and further evidence  submitted  at
    the hearing.  I do not accept this contention, and in my view the judge
    did take all of the evidence into account.

20. The  judge  set  out  the  documents  received  from  both  parties  in
    paragraphs 11 and 12 of  the  decision.   Paragraph  11  sets  out  the
    documents contained within the Respondent's bundle, which includes  the
    letter from Proacc Associates dated 6th November 2013  referred  to  in
    the grounds seeking permission to appeal,  and  also  the  HMRC  letter
    dated 5th October 2013 referring to  national  insurance  contributions
    that needed to be  paid  before  31st  January  2014,  which  was  also
    referred to in the grounds.

21. In paragraph 12 the judge specifically refers to the HMRC letter  which
    is dated 4  October  2014,  and  which  refers  to  national  insurance
    contributions in the sum of �74.25 to be paid before 31st January 2015.
     The documents referred to in this  paragraph  also  include  the  copy
    pamphlet advertising the Sponsor's business, again which  was  referred
    to in the grounds  seeking permission.

22. The judge made findings on the issue of the Sponsor's treaty rights  in
    paragraphs 29 to 31.  I observe that there  was  no  reference  in  the
    witness statements prepared by the Appellant and Sponsor to  the  issue
    of  treaty  rights,  as  those   statements   concentrated   on   their
    relationship.

23. I cannot ascertain what evidence the judge has failed  to  consider  in
    relation to treaty rights.  There is reference in the grounds  to  bank
    statements being submitted, and these are referred to in  paragraph  12
    of the decision, and considered in paragraph 29.  The  bank  statements
    are issued by Barclays, in the name of the Sponsor, and consist  of  an
    annual summary for the period 19th  September  2013  -  18th  September
    2014.  All this shows is that the Sponsor had an average balance  while
    in credit of �71.39 and an average balance while overdrawn of  �9.78dr.
    She did not incur  any  fees  or  charges.   In  addition  the  Sponsor
    provided her bank statements covering a period between 17th May -  15th
    August 2014.  The judge clearly  considered  these  statements,  noting
    that there were cash deposits and that there was only one  entry  which
    related to cleaning, on 21st July 2014 in the sum of �60.

24. In considering the  evidence,  the  judge  noted  the  absence  of  any
    accounts, any letters from clients, the absence of a  tax  return,  and
    noted that the bank  statements  did  not  cover  a  particularly  long
    period.  The tax return could have been provided if it had been  lodged
    with HMRC.  I accept that in relation to the tax year ending  in  April
    2014, the deadline for submitting a tax return does  not  expire  until
    31st January 2015, but the judge was entitled to take into account  its
    absence, and the absence of any further  letter  from  the  Appellant's
    accountants, following the letter dated 6th November 2013, issued  some
    twelve months previously.

25. The judge did not take into account any irrelevant considerations,  nor
    did she omit to consider any relevant considerations or  evidence.   It
    is not suggested that  her  decision  reaches  the  high  threshold  of
    perversity, and in my view  the  decision  could  not  be  regarded  as
    perverse.  The judge did not misdirect herself  in  law.   She  had  to
    consider whether the Sponsor had submitted sufficient evidence to prove
    that she was exercising treaty rights as a self-employed  person.   The
    burden of proof was on  the  Appellant.   The  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude that insufficient evidence had been submitted, and I find  the
    challenge made by the Appellant amounts  to  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings made by the judge, but does not disclose an error of law.

26. In relation to the Respondent's submission that the judge erred in  law
    in considering the relationship between the parties,  I  conclude  that
    this submission is not made out.

27. The judge was aware of the concerns  expressed  by  the  Respondent  in
    relation to the relationship, and was aware that the couple had married
    very shortly after meeting, and the judge was aware of the  Appellant's
    immigration history which is set out in  paragraphs  1  and  2  of  the
    decision.  The  judge  was  also  aware  that  when  the  couple  first
    attempted to marry on 1st July 2013, the Appellant was  apprehended  by
    Immigration Officers and arrested as an overstayer.

28. The judge considered the relationship between the parties at paragraphs
    14 - 28.  The judge found that the concerns expressed by the Respondent
    broadly fell into four categories, and dealt with each  of  those  four
    categories in her decision.

29. The decision demonstrates that the judge carefully considered  all  the
    relevant evidence, giving particular consideration  to  the  record  of
    interview, and the oral evidence given by the  Appellant  and  Sponsor,
    both in-chief and in cross-examination.

30. While it may be said that some judges  may  have  reached  a  different
    conclusion, that is not relevant, and not the  issue  that  I  have  to
    decide.  I conclude that the judge did give  careful  consideration  to
    all the issues raised in  relation  to  the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and Sponsor, and was entitled to conclude that  the  marriage
    was not one of convenience, and adequate and sustainable  reasons  were
    given for reaching this conclusion.  The points made by the  Respondent
    in the rule  24  response  indicate  a  strong  disagreement  with  the
    decision made by the judge, but do not disclose an error of law.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve  the  making  of  an
error on a point of law.

I do not set aside the decision and the appeal is dismissed.


Anonymity

No order for anonymity was made by the First-tier Tribunal.  There has  been
no request for anonymity and the Upper Tribunal makes no anonymity order.
