                                                                 Respondents

Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr P Naith (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)
For the Respondents:     Ms J Norman (counsel instructed by Sterling and
Law Associates)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the
   First-tier Tribunal to allow the appeals of Sabina and Liana  Mollayeva,
   a  mother  and  her  daughter  respectively,  and   both   citizens   of
   Turkmenistan (born 6 November 1976 and 23 February  1999),  against  the
   decisions of the Respondent of 15 July 2015  and  23  February  2016  to
   refuse Sabina's applications as an unmarried partner and on the basis of
   ten years' lawful residence; Liana, who entered  the  UK  as  a  student
   dependent  of  her  mother,  was  once  again  a  dependent,   on   each
   application.


2. Sabina entered the UK as a student, and then applied for  further  leave
   as the unmarried partner of a British citizen, Ali Reza  Samani,  on  20
   March 2015, with whom she had by then been in a  relationship  for  over
   nine years. Her partner application  was  refused  because  the  English
   language test provider (ETS) had reported, some time  after  the  event,
   that their testing processes had  shown  that  the  Appellant's  English
   language test of 22 February 2012 at  the  European  College  of  Higher
   Education appeared to have been taken by a proxy on her behalf. The long
   residence application was unsurprisingly refused for  the  same  reason.
   Considering  the  applications  outside  the   Rules,   the   Respondent
   considered that there were no exceptional  circumstances  present  given
   the family unit could relocate to Turkmenistan together.


3. The First-tier Tribunal heard the appeals and  allowed  them,  accepting
   the evidence of the First Respondent because


   a. She was self-evidently highly proficient in English, and had passed
      her exams with a First Class Honours Degree and there was no reason to
      think she would need to resort to deception;
   b. She had volunteered the information that, despite the appearance to
      the contrary given by the Home Office paperwork, her daughter had not
      spent seven consecutive years in the UK as she had had a two-year
      spell back in Turkmenistan studying: accordingly it would be wrong to
      afford Liana the benefit of being treated as a seven year resident
      child;
   c. She had provided information regarding the details and methods used in
      the testing process, and of her recollection of surrounding events
      such as her journey there on each of the two days;
   d. The Secretary of State had produced spreadsheets showing the basis for
      her conclusion on proxy testing only after repeated prompting from the
      Respondents, and the Home Office evidence was generic, Professor
      French having accepted the existence of false positives.


4. The Secretary of State  appealed  on  the  basis  that  the  three-stage
   exercise in evaluating whether the burden of proof had  been  discharged
   had not been adequately  carried  out,  as  was  shown  by  the  judge's
   reference to the witness statements being generic. On 15  May  2017  the
   First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  the  basis  it  was
   arguable this asserted error had indeed been made.


5. Mr Naith submitted that the essential  three-stage  test  had  not  been
   followed through, leading to the First-tier Tribunal  giving  inadequate
   reasons for finding that the Home Office case failed to  carry  the  day
   when evaluated against the evidence of Sabina.


6. Ms Norman replied that the substance of the appropriate  test  had  been
   applied, and the First-tier Tribunal's thinking was perfectly clear: the
   burden of proof lay on  the  Secretary  of  State,  who  had  failed  to
   discharge it, given the cogent case put forward by the Respondents.



Findings and reasons


7. The Upper Tribunal cites expert evidence deployed by a litigant  seeking
   to cast doubt upon the validity testing process  used  by  ETS  in  Gazi
   (IJR) [2015] UKUT 327 (IAC):


           "Dr Harrison  also  examines,  with  accompanying  critique  and
           commentary,   the   discrete   issues   of   factors   affecting
           performance; the typical performance of human verification;  the
           definition of thresholds; the explicit acknowledgement of  human
           errors; the lack of testing of the performance of analysts;  the
           dubious touchstone of "confidence" (see Mr Millington's  witness
           statement); the dearth of information about the actual  analysis
           methodology;  the  lack  of  detail  about  the  experience  and
           knowledge of both the recruited analysts and their  supervisors;
           the indication that any training of the newly recruited analysts
           was  hurried;  the  shortcomings  in  Mr   Millington's   speech
           recognition averments; and the clear acknowledgement on the part
           of ETS that false identifications (viz false  positive  results)
           have occurred. One passage relating to  the  human  verification
           process is especially noteworthy:
                 "... although the analysts only verified matches where they
                 had no doubt about their validity  -  ie  where  they  were
                 certain about their judgments - this should not be taken as
                 a reliable indicator of the accuracy  of  those  judgments.
                 This approach does not remove the risk  of  false  positive
                 results."
           Dr Harrison also highlights that both the automatic  system  and
           the human analysts are capable of  false  positive  errors.  The
           Secretary of State's  evidence  does  not  disclose  either  the
           percentage or the volume of such errors."


8. No findings  were  made  on  that  evidence  in  Gazi.  However  in  the
   subsequent appeal of Qadir [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC) the UT  concludes  that
   the Home Office evidence had significant shortcomings, in particular  at
   [63], a lack of qualifications or expertise of the officials who visited
   ETS and produced witness statements based on their visit to ETS,  during
   which ETS  was  the  sole  arbiter  of  the  information  disclosed  and
   assertions made, undue Home Office dependency on  the  information  from
   ETS when ETS had put forward no witness or  indeed  any  other  evidence
   whatsoever of their own, the lack of any expert evidence backing up  the
   opinion of the staff who visited ETS, and the fact that voice  recording
   files  had  never  been  put  forward  pertaining  to   the   appellants
   themselves. Accordingly the Tribunal accepted that the methods  used  by
   ETS were not  necessarily  guaranteed  to  avoid  the  occasional  false
   positive whereby an innocent student is  wrongly  identified  as  having
   cheated in their test.


9. It would be perfectly open to the Secretary  of  State  to  put  forward
   further evidence of the methods used by  ETS  in  order  to  answer  the
   critique of Dr Harrison, for example if their software was identified or
   the expertise of the ETS analysts was set out in greater detail. If  she
   does not do so she runs the risk that fact-finders will  employ  similar
   reasoning to that in Qadir (subsequently upheld as lawful by  the  Court
   of Appeal), ie that the direct evidence of genuineness  put  forward  by
   the migrant accused of dishonesty outweighs  the   somewhat  generalised
   material relied upon by the Home Office.


10. The President explains in  Muhandiramge  [2015]  UKUT  675  (IAC),  that
   decisions in these cases involve  a  "moderately  complex  exercise"  in
   which "the evidential pendulum swings three times and in three different
   directions". To quote more of his evocative words directly:


           "(a) First,  where  the  Secretary  of  State  alleges  that  an
           applicant  has  practised  dishonesty   or   deception   in   an
           application for leave to remain, there is an  evidential  burden
           on  the  Secretary  of  State.  This  requires  that  sufficient
           evidence be adduced to raise an issue as to the existence or non-
           existence of a fact in issue:  for  example,  by  producing  the
           completed application which is prima  facie  deceitful  in  some
           material fashion.
           (b) The spotlight thereby  switches  to  the  applicant.  If  he
           discharges the burden - again, an evidential one - of raising an
           innocent explanation, namely  an  account  which  satisfies  the
           minimum level of plausibility, a further transfer of the  burden
           of proof occurs.
           (c) Where (b) is satisfied, the burden rests on the Secretary of
           State to establish, on the balance of  probabilities,  that  the
           Appellant's prima facie innocent explanation is to be rejected.
           A veritable burden of proof boomerang!"


11. I do not consider that the First-tier Tribunal adopted an approach  that
   was inconsistent with that summarised above. It properly directed itself
   to the fact that the burden of proof lay upon the  Secretary  of  State,
   and then considered whether or not the first Respondent was a person  of
   good character who had provided  an  innocent  explanation  such  as  to
   outweigh the material put forward by  the  Home  Office.  It  identified
   several reasons for finding this to be the case. In the  light  of  this
   finding, its conclusion permitted only one inference:  bearing  in  mind
   the ultimate legal burden was on the Secretary of  State,  she  had  not
   discharged it.


12. True  it  is  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasons  are  concisely
   expressed. However, as stated by the President in Shizad (sufficiency of
   reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85  (IAC)  �10:  "reasons  need  not  be
   extensive if the decision as a whole makes sense, having regard  to  the
   material accepted by the judge".


13. Detailed  reasons  are  provided  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  its
   decision. It seems to me that this is an appeal where the  enjoinder  in
   Piglowska v Piglowski [1999] 1 WLR 1360  (endorsed  in  the  immigration
   context in EA [2017] EWCA Civ 10 �27) is relevant:  "reasons  should  be
   read on the assumption that, unless he has  demonstrated  the  contrary,
   the judge knew how he should perform his functions and which matters  he
   should take into account ... [an]  appellate  court  should  resist  the
   temptation to subvert the principle  that  they  should  not  substitute
   their own discretion for that of the judge by a narrow textual  analysis
   which enables them to claim that he misdirected himself".


14. I accordingly conclude that the reasoning  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   was properly open to it and I dismiss the appeal.

          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  contain  a  material
    error of law.
    The appeal is dismissed.
