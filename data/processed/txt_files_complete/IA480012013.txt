                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Not represented
For the respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Haowei Mao, date of birth 28.1.90, is a citizen of China.



 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Colvin, who allowed the claimant's  appeal
    against the decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  29.10.13,  to
    refuse his application made on 27.9.13 to vary leave to remain  in  the
    UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student under the Points  Based  System  (PBS)
    and to  remove  him  from  the  UK  by  way  of  directions  under  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 9.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    8.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.8.14 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. There was no attendance by or on behalf of the claimant. I note that he
    did not have any appointed legal representative.  Attempts  to  contact
    him during the course of the morning  were  unsuccessful.  However,  Mr
    Avery was able to locate a minute sheet to show that the  claimant  had
    booked a flight for 2.9.14 and  further  information  that  his  course
    concludes on 16.9.14. It would appear therefore that  the  claimant  is
    making a voluntary departure from the UK. I proceeded to deal with  the
    appeal in his absence, noting that he has made no Rule 24  response  to
    the grounds of appeal or the grant of  permission  to  appeal.  In  the
    circumstances, I proceed on the assumption that  the  claimant  has  no
    case to put before the Tribunal to challenge  the  submissions  of  the
    Secretary of State.

Error of Law

 6. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Colvin should be set aside.

 7. The application was refused because the claimant failed to qualify  for
    the necessary 10 points under Appendix  C  for  maintenance  funds.  He
    failed to demonstrate by specified documents that he had the  necessary
    funds (�9,000) for a consecutive  28-day  period  between  18.8.13  and
    14.9.13.

 8. For the reasons set out herein, the decision was wrong and Judge Colvin
    was completely in  error  as  to  the  application  of  any  evidential
    flexibility policy.

 9. At �11 of the determination Judge Colvin correctly noted that  pursuant
    to section 85A of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  the
    Tribunal can only consider evidence adduced by the  claimant  submitted
    in support of and at the time of making the application  to  which  the
    immigration  decision  related.   However,  at  �13  and  �15  of   the
    determination the judge effectively ignored this statutory provision by
    purporting to find, on the basis of post-application evidence from  the
    claimant that when a  second  bank  account,  not  submitted  with  his
    application, was taken into account "it is clear that the appellant had
    sufficient funds in excess of the �9,000 he was required to show during
    this period, (�13),"  and (�15) "It should also be noted  that  I  have
    made the finding that the appellant did indeed have the required  funds
    for the specific period under the Immigration Rules in relation to  the
    Tier 4 visa." Those findings amount to an error  of  law  in  that  the
    Tribunal was not able to take into account or consider the evidence not
    submitted with the application.

10. Further,  between  �11  and  �15  of  the  determination  Judge  Colvin
    proceeded to find that the  evidence  submitted  by  the  claimant  was
    sufficient to trigger the 'evidential flexibility  policy'  creating  a
    duty on the Secretary of State to make enquiries of the claimant as  to
    the submitted banking evidence before making her  decision.  The  judge
    concluded that in failing to make such enquiries the Secretary of State
    did not act in accordance with the law. Judge Colvin also purported  to
    find that the claimant had the necessary funds for the specified period
    under the Immigration Rules.

11. First, Judge Colvin purported to rely  on  the  outdated  authority  of
    Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013] UKUT 00042,  when  that  decision
    had been overturned by the Court of Appeal in January 2014  in  SSHD  v
    Rodriguez and Others [2014] EWCA Civ 2, where  it  was  held  that  the
    Secretary of State was not under any obligation  to  afford  applicants
    for  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrants   any
    opportunity to remedy defects in their application under an  evidential
    flexibility policy. The Court  of  Appeal  noted  that  the  evidential
    flexibility policy was not designed to  give  an  applicant  a  general
    opportunity first to remedy any defect or inadequacy in an  application
    or supporting documentation so as to save the application from  refusal
    after consideration.

12. The  common  law  principle  of  fairness  does  not  impose  any  such
    obligation and nor do the specific provisions of paragraph 245AA of the
    Immigration Rules, which came into force in relation to  PBS  cases  in
    September 2012. In effect, in  relation  to  PBS  cases  no  evidential
    flexibility policy survived the introduction of  paragraph  245AA.  The
    preceding policy, the 'Process Instruction',  effectively  mirrors  the
    format of paragraph 245AA when introduced in September 2012.

13. At �12 of the determination, Judge Colvin  referenced  paragraph  245AA
    but appears to ignore its provisions when making the  decision  in  the
    appeal. The provisions are set out below:

         "245AA. Documents not submitted with applications

         (a) Where Part 6A or any appendices referred to in  Part  6A  state
         that specified documents must  be  provided,  the  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of  State  will  only
         consider documents that have been submitted with  the  application,
         and will only consider documents submitted  after  the  application
         where they are submitted in accordance with subparagraph (b).

         (b) If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:

         (i) Some of the documents in a  sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
         example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);

         (ii) A document is in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is
         not on letterhead paper as specified); or

         (iii) A document is a copy and not an original document; or

         (iv) A document does not contain all of the specified information;

         the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or  the  Secretary
         of State  may  contact  the  applicant  or  his  representative  in
         writing, and request the correct documents. The requested documents
         must be received at the address specified in the request  within  7
         working days of the date of the request.

         (c) Documents will not be requested where a specified document  has
         not been submitted (for example an English language certificate  is
         missing), or where the Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer
         or the Secretary of State does not anticipate that  addressing  the
         omission or error referred to in subparagraph (b) will  lead  to  a
         grant because the application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document: (i) in the
         wrong format; or

         (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or

         (iii) which does not contain all of the specified information,  but
         the missing information is verifiable from:

         (1) other documents submitted with the application,

         (2) the website of the organisation which issued the  document,  or
         (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body;

         the application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State is
         satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are  genuine  and   the
         applicant meets all the other  requirements.  The  Entry  Clearance
         Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State reserves the
         right to request the specified original documents  in  the  correct
         format in all cases where (b) applies, and to  refuse  applications
         if these documents are not provided as set out in (b)."

14. The judge failed to provide any cogent explanation why the Secretary of
    State was required to apply some other flexibility policy  despite  the
    operation of paragraph 245AA, stating only that from the submitted bank
    statement it was clear that the claimant had  transferred   �15,500  to
    another account in his own name. "This might reasonably  have  put  the
    decision maker on notice that the appellant had another account holding
    this amount of money but had failed  to  give  details  of  this  other
    account and this, in  itself,  trigger(s)  the  evidential  flexibility
    policy so as to make enquiries  of  the  appellant  before  an  adverse
    decision was made."

15. Quite apart from that fact that this conclusion flies in  the  face  of
    both the current case law and the  Immigration  Rules,  a  transfer  of
    funds out of an account does not "trigger" or  reasonably  require  the
    Secretary of State to speculate that the money might  be  available  to
    the claimant elsewhere,  rather  than  dissipated  or  used  for  other
    purposes. Further, the judge failed to explain  why  the  Secretary  of
    State was not entitled to rely on the provisions of paragraph 245AA  to
    consider only those documents submitted with the application.

16. As Judge Hollingworth noted when granting permission to appeal, "It  is
    plainly the case that there is no duty on the  Secretary  of  State  to
    communicate  with  each  and  every  applicant  where  there  is   some
    deficiency in the application. Fairness does not require the  Secretary
    of State to address any deficiency. It is for the appellant  ultimately
    to retain responsibility for ensuring that his  application  meets  the
    requirements laid down by the Rules. It is arguable  that  the  Judge's
    conclusion at paragraph 14 is wrong."

17. In the circumstances, the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    flawed by reason of such error of law in the  making  of  the  decision
    that it cannot stand. For the reasons given herein, the  appeal  should
    have been dismissed. It is inevitable that the  appeal  must  fail.  In
    fact, it was doomed from the outset and there was no  merit  whatsoever
    in the appeal.

Conclusions:

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There was no merit in the appeal and it has been dismissed.
