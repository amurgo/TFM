Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms G Patel, instructed by Broudie Jackson & Canter
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Zahra Jaberizadeh, date of birth 19.9.85, is  a  citizen
    of Iran.

 2. This is her appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Gladstone  promulgated  29.1.15,  dismissing  her  appeal  against  the
    decisions of the Secretary of  State,  dated  25.9.14,  to  refuse  her
    asylum, humanitarian protection and human rights claims and  to  remove
    her from the UK under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum At 1999.
    The Judge heard the appeal on 20.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Denson  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.2.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 28.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The appellant did not attend and the hearing was confined to
    submissions in respect of error of law.

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find that there was no error of law in
    the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Gladstone to be set aside.

 6. The application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that the
    judge's findings that the appellant's  claimed  employment  at  Bushehr
    Airport was not credible was flawed, because  of  reliance  on  matters
    both stated and not stated at her screening interview; for  failure  to
    provide cogent reasons for rejecting Dr Khaki's expert  report  on  the
    employment letter; for substitution of the judge's own opinion; and for
    expressing an opinion as to the photographs of  injuries  submitted  by
    the appellant.

 7. A further ground is that the judge failed  to  fully  engage  with  the
    arguments in respect of illegal exit and risk on return, and failed  to
    take into account a Court of Appeal case and the Iran OGN at 31.17.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Denson improperly  reached  the
    conclusion that the judge erred in law by (1)  failing  to  make  clear
    findings in relation to  the  expert  report;  (2)  placing  weight  on
    photographs and making findings in relation thereto without appropriate
    medical qualification  to  do  so;  (3)  placing  too  much  weight  on
    credibility issues as regards to information given in  the  appellant's
    screening interview.

 9. With due respect to Judge Denson, it is not for the  judge  considering
    an application for permission to appeal to make findings of  errors  of
    law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. The correct approach at
    the permission stage is confined to considering only whether  there  is
    an arguable error of law such that the  matter  should  be  allowed  to
    proceed to an appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. It is for  me,  in
    this instance, to decide whether there is any  material  error  of  law
    such as to require the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  set
    aside and remade.  In  the  circumstances,  I  reject  and  ignore  the
    purported findings of errors of law by Judge Denson.

10. I  have  considered  the  complaint  that  the  judge  relied  on  both
    information disclosed and not disclosed in the screening  interview  as
    part of her findings in relation to credibility. Ms Patel reminded  the
    Tribunal that  the  primary  purpose  the  screening  interview  is  to
    establish the appellant's method and route of arrival into the  UK  and
    she was told that she would not be questioned as to the details of  her
    asylum claim. However, it remains the case that what is stated  in  the
    screening interview must be true. It is not the  case  that  the  judge
    based primary credibility findings on the failure of the  appellant  to
    mention certain matters in the screening interview, but the  judge  was
    certainly entitled when assessing the credibility  of  the  appellant's
    account to observe that some matters mentioned previously  when  giving
    her initial account were not part of her current account. For  example,
    at �139 the judge  noted  that  the  appellant  had  mentioned  in  her
    screening interview that she had seen guns that were being  transported
    to an Arab country. However, in her substantive  asylum  interview  she
    said that there was no writing on the crates she claimed to  have  seen
    and she has not explained how she could know they were going to an Arab
    country. Further, she said  the  boxes  were  being  unloaded  and  not
    loaded, and that it was only a rumour  where  they  were  destined.  In
    fact, as the judge explained at �140 her account as  to  what  she  had
    seen varied, but she has stated that she did  not  know  what  she  had
    claimed to see. She was making assumptions and did not  even  view  the
    footage of what she  claimed  to  have  recorded,  giving  inconsistent
    reasons as to why she did so.

11. Another example is that at her screening interview the appellant stated
    that she thought no one had seen her filming. However,  in  her  asylum
    interview she eventually said that a colleague had  seen  her  filming.
    The judge was  certainly  entitled  to  put  this  discrepancy  to  the
    appellant during the hearing, in response to which the  appellant  said
    that the screening interview was short and if she had  been  asked  for
    more details she would have given  them.  The  judge  was  entitled  to
    reject this explanation at �142 of the decision,  concluding  that  she
    had fabricated the account of a colleague seeing her to  reinforce  her
    asylum claim, an embellishment. The appellant had given an  account  in
    her screening interview which was inconsistent with her later  account.
    The judge was  entitled  to  take  account  of  this  as  part  of  the
    credibility assessment. In the circumstances, I find no error of law in
    respect of this ground of appeal.

12. Even if there was undue  weight  given  to  matters  arising  from  the
    screening interview, I do not accept that in the light of the decision,
    taken as a whole, such an error was material  to  the  outcome  of  the
    decision. The various matters set out by the judge are an  overwhelming
    indictment of the appellant's credibility and the  ultimate  conclusion
    and I am satisfied that the decision in the appeal would certainly have
    been the same, even if there had been no  reference  to  the  screening
    interview.

13. I do not find any error of law in the complaint that at �135, �137  and
    �138 the judge superimposed her own perception of what she would expect
    to take place in an airport, or the suggestion that  the  judge  should
    have sought clarification from  the  appellant  and  her  witnesses  by
    supplemental questioning if she found the evidence confusing. The judge
    was not confused, but found the evidence on  behalf  of  the  appellant
    confused, for the reasons set out at �134 of the decision, pointing out
    the  discrepancy  between  there  being  a  huge  and  secret  military
    operation and yet there was allegedly  very  little  security  so  that
    anyone could walk about any part of the airport. And yet  the  paranoia
    was such the concern that the appellant might have seen  something  she
    should not resulted in threats to kill or torture her, or the fear that
    if returned that would be the outcome.

14. It is quite clear that the judge found the appellant's factual  account
    not credible. In particular, at �135 the judge did not find it credible
    that the appellant would be employed in the  way  she  described,  with
    little or no checks, on the say so of a friend of a cousin. This is not
    the judge superimposing her own perception but part of the judge's task
    to assess the  credibility  of  the  appellant  and  her  own  account.
    Frankly, it is obvious from the analysis of the judge  that  she  found
    the account unbelievable, if not entirely ludicrous. Whilst  the  judge
    is entitled to ask questions to clarify matters, she was not obliged to
    do so, either with the appellant or other  witnesses.  It  is  for  the
    appellant to set out her case.

15. I find no error of law in  respect  of  the  judge's  treatment  of  Dr
    Khaki's  so-called  expert  evidence  between  �128  and  �132  of  the
    decision. His opinion was confined to the  letter  alleged  to  emanate
    from the appellant's employer, adduced to support  her  claim  to  have
    worked at the airport. The letter in question was only produced at  the
    asylum interview and  not  at  the  screening  interview.  It  was  not
    translated at that time and was resubmitted with a translation  in  the
    appellant's bundle submitted five days before the  appeal  hearing.  At
    �129 the judge noted that the  translation,  which  is  not  dated,  is
    inaccurate suggesting that the letter was from the  bank  addressed  to
    the airline, when in fact it was the other way round. It  appears  that
    Dr Khakhi saw only an untranslated document.

16. I find Judge Gladstone's criticism of Dr Khaki adequately reasoned  and
    entirely justified. At �129 the judge pointed out certain errors in the
    analysis and queried on what basis Dr Khaki could express an opinion on
    the validity of the letter from Iran Air, including his suggestion that
    it had been stamped by the "relevant department." It is not clear  that
    the original was seen, as the Notary Office stamp  indicated  that  the
    document is a photocopy of the original. It  remains  unclear  on  what
    basis Dr Khaki could be said to be an expert sufficiently qualified  to
    decide that the letter is genuine. He is not a  document  examiner.  My
    attention has been drawn to page 2 of his report, where he states  that
    the letter corresponds to "all legal and official  requirements  for  a
    genuine employment confirmation letter." This appears to  be  based  on
    the fact that the letter was drafted on headed notepaper and  that  the
    stamps used are all correct and in accordance with "expected standards"
    for such a confirmation document. It also has a  batch  number  on  it,
    suggesting that the government printed it. I have  also  considered  Dr
    Khaki's stated qualifications at A27, which suggests that he  has  been
    providing expert  opinions  on  Iranian  law  and  procedure,  and  the
    structure of the Iranian legal system. However, like Judge Gladstone, I
    do not see how  that  makes  him  qualified  as  a  document  examiner.
    Further, that it may be on what appears to be  official  letter  headed
    paper and stamped does not  demonstrate  that  the  letter  content  is
    genuine.

17. At  �131  the  judge  explained  that  she  could  not  tell  when  the
    certification took place and noted  that  the  claimant  asserted  that
    there were two letters, one of which she had  retained.  At  �136,  the
    judge noted that even if Dr Khaki  is  correct  and  the  claimant  was
    employed by Iran Air, as claimed, it only  demonstrated  that  she  was
    employed as of 25.4.12, some 7 months before the alleged  incident  and
    did not confirm that she worked in the relevant area of the airport  or
    would have the access she claims to have.  In  the  circumstances,  the
    judge was entitled to attach limited weight to the expert evidence.

18. Notwithstanding the judge's cogent criticism  of  the  evidence  of  Dr
    Khaki, at �133 the judge very properly considered that evidence not  on
    its own in isolation but in the context of the evidence as a whole,  as
    she was entitled and required to do. The judge then set out a number of
    concerns about the claimant's account,  which  undermined  the  factual
    basis of her claim, concluding at �137 that even if she was employed at
    the airport in November 2012, the remainder  of  her  account  was  not
    credible, for the reasons carefully set out in  the  decision.  I  find
    that the judge's careful and detailed analysis of the  claimant's  case
    and  evidence  is  unassailable.  The  judge  has   clearly   correctly
    understood and taken into account the expert evidence in the context of
    the evidence as a whole. If there was an error in not reaching a  final
    view as to whether Dr Khaki's evidence was to be accepted or  rejected,
    it was not material in the light of the judge's alternative finding set
    out above.

19. In relation to the photographs, which are on the court file, I find  no
    error of law in the  criticism  made.  At  �145  and  �147,  the  judge
    considered the appellant's claim that she  was  slapped  several  times
    during her first alleged detention to the extent that her face was  all
    black and blue. Her account,  set  out  between  �26  and  �28  of  the
    decision was that she was returned home about 4pm and asked her  mother
    to come over, but not to bring her son, as her face was all  black  and
    blue. At �145 the judge observed that this claim was not borne  out  by
    the photographs allegedly taken either the same day as the slapping  or
    after the second detention two days  later.  The  judge  was  asked  to
    consider the photographs as  supporting  evidence  of  the  appellant's
    claim. The judge was entitled to observe that  they  do  not  show  the
    appellant's face to be black and blue as claimed.  Ms  Patel  suggested
    that they showed that  the  appellant  had  been  injured  but  such  a
    submission is to  commit  the  same  error  as  alleged  against  Judge
    Gladstone, expressing inexpert medical opinion  on  the  basis  of  the
    photographs. In find no error of law in respect of this issue. It  does
    not require medical expertise to observe that the  photographs  do  not
    show the appellant's face to be black and  blue,   (although  they  may
    show some redness or apparent skin irritation to the right  cheek)  and
    thus the judge was  entitled  to  consider  that  they  undermined  the
    appellant's account.

20. Finally, I find no material error of law in relation  to  the  risk  on
    return following illegal exit, as  set  out  at  �16  and  �17  of  the
    grounds. The judge was correct to rely on SB (Iran), to the effect that
    illegal exit does not attract the  adverse  attention  of  the  Iranian
    authorities. It is a Country Guidance case that remains valid  and  the
    judge was obliged to follow it, unless there  is  good  and  sufficient
    evidence to suggest that the factual basis  for  the  guidance  is  now
    wrong. All the appellant and Ms Patel relied on was one statement  from
    the OGN of September 2013 at 31.17 which quotes  an  unnamed  judge  as
    suggesting that returnees are held for a few days until it is clear  to
    the police that they have not  been  involved  in  political  activity.
    Frankly, this single unattributable source is  woefully  inadequate  to
    demonstrate that the judge was in error of law by  relying  on  current
    country guidance and failing to depart from it on such a flimsy basis.

21. Complaint is made within this ground of the judge's criticism  at  �155
    of the appellant's representative including in the  bundle  a  copy  of
    what was an interlocutory order in a pending appeal.  It  was,  as  the
    judge stated, merely an order granting permission to appeal. It  surely
    cannot be said that such a document was  relevant  to  put  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal when the issues in that appeal were not resolved. I
    find no error of law in this regard.

22. All in all the grounds  are  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings and conclusions of the judge and an  attempt  to  reargue  the
    appeal. No material error of law is disclosed.



Conclusion & Decision

23. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
