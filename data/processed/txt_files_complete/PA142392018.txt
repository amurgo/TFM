      1. Both subparagraphs of rule 40(3) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698  as  amended)  apply  to  this
         decision.

      2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal sent out on 8 October  2019
         is erroneous in law.  I set it aside.

         de novo at an oral hearing before a judge other than Judge Clemes.
