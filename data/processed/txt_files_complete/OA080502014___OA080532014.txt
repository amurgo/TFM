For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr C Emezie, DCK Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. I refer to the Appellant in this appeal as the Entry Clearance  Officer
    (ECO) and to the Respondents as the Claimants. The  Claimants  in  this
    case are Nigerian nationals born on 18 May 1952 and  26  December  1994
    respectively. The  relationship  to  the  EEA  national  sponsor  ("the
    sponsor") is that of mother-in-law and brother-in-law. The ECO  refused
    their applications for entry clearance as a family member and  extended
    family member of the EEA national sponsor under Regulations 7 and 8  of
    the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006.  Their
    appeals against those decisions were  allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Rees in a decision promulgated on 2 June 2015.


 2. The ECO was granted permission to appeal on 12 August  2015  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Ford against that decision on the basis that it was
    arguable that there was inadequate reasoning in  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal in relation to the findings of dependency.



 3. I found at a hearing on 13 October 2015 that there was an error of  law
    in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. I found that it  was  clear
    from the ECO's decision and indeed from the application  form  of  both
    Claimants that they were in receipt of an income in  Nigeria  amounting
    to �109 from income as a petty trader  and  further  income  from  some
    property and rents. In view of the  fact  that  the  Claimants  had  an
    income in Nigeria and that this was an issue raised by  the  Respondent
    it was incumbent on the First-tier Tribunal to apply the  correct  test
    and consider whether the remittances from  the  sponsor  were  in  fact
    required as  material  support  for  essential  needs.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal made no findings regarding how the money from the sponsor  was
    used or whether it was necessary to meet their essential needs.



 4. I rejected the ECO's second ground of appeal and found that the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge's finding that the sponsor's wife and the Claimants
    were related as claimed was adequately reasoned and open to him on  the
    evidence. In the light of the  limited  findings  of  fact  required  I
    considered that it was appropriate for the decision to  be  re-made  in
    the Upper Tribunal.



The Re-hearing

   5. The sponsor, Mr Courage Enomayo,  gave  evidence.  He  relied  on  the
      witness statement dated 2 April 2015 at page 1 of the bundle that  was
      before the First-tier Tribunal.


   6. Mr Emezie asked a number of supplemental questions. He asked what  the
      first Claimant's job as a petty trader entailed. The sponsor  answered
      that she sold  seasonal  fruits  like  mangos,  oranges  and  tomatoes
      depending on the season and not on a large scale. She had a stall in a
      market in Benin City. The stall was the size of a  table.   Mr  Emezie
      asked if she made �100 a month. He said that he did not know but  knew
      that they paid for rent for the stall. He could not confirm her income
      - it could be less. She  was  a  petty  trader.  The  fruits  came  in
      different seasons. She sold fruits that were available. Mr Emezie said
      to him that she stated in her  application  form  that  there  was  an
      income of 41,000 Naira from property and asked him to confirm this. He
      said that he did not know and did not know  how  she  could  get  that
      amount. The property was located at Auchi which was a small town.   Mr
      Emezie asked if she was renting out the whole property. He  said  that
      he did not know and did not expect the rent to be more than 2000 Naira
      monthly. He did not know how much that was  in  sterling.   Mr  Emezie
      asked how many rooms were rented out. He  said  he  had  no  idea.  Mr
      Emezie asked what she did with the money. He said that  she  paid  for
      the stall. Her house rent was 20,000 Naira and transportation would be
      5,000 Naira and the cost of renting a shop 15,000 Naira.   Her  living
      expenses would be 35-40,000  Naira  and  8,000  for  house  help.  Her
      medication for high  blood  pressure  was  20,000  and  she  paid  for
      Harrison's extra mural studies.  He was a student with  fees  of  5000
      Naira a month.


   7. The sponsor said that he sent 20,000 Naira a month for living expenses
      for food, bills and so on. The first Claimant was 63 years old. He did
      not think that they sent her enough money and without it things  would
      be difficult.

   8. Mr Kotas asked how the Claimants were related to his wife. The sponsor
      said that they were the mother of his wife and her  son.  The  sponsor
      came to the United Kingdom in 2009 and he could not remember when  his
      wife came. They sent money in one  transaction  per  month.  His  wife
      worked part-time. They married in 2012. Before they married  his  wife
      sent them money and then she had children and could not.  He  did  not
      know how much she was sending. They possibly used an agent to fill out
      their application forms.  It was not a guess that there  was  �108  of
      expenses. Before he decided to help her he worked out what she needed.



   9. They had been living in Benin City for about 2 years.  They  were  not
      living in Auchi in 2014.  He did not know why it  said  Auchi  in  the
      application form, perhaps it was because she  got  her  correspondence
      there. Mr Kotas said that she said she lived there for  19  years  and
      asked where she was  living  in  May  2014.  He  said  Auchi  was  the
      correspondence address.

  10. It was put to him that in Harrison's application form they were  asked
      about finances and he said that he gave �100 to his mum.  The  sponsor
      confirmed that he sent �100 a month which was enough for food.  It was
      put to him that she earned more from petty trading and at Q66  of  the
      application form said she earned �150 from  properties  and  rent.  He
      said that he did not think she got the money on  her  own.  It  was  a
      polygamous home. She was in charge of collecting the rent.  It was put
      to him that she earned more from rental property  than  from  him.  He
      said she had to live and had expenses.  She  had  other  children  and
      brothers. They did not support her. They lived not far away.  She  had
      two daughters and two sons in Nigeria.  The daughters  had  their  own
      families. Harrison was trying to get into University and the other was
      a grown up. In February last year he was unemployed. He could be doing
      a petty job like construction.

  11. The first Claimant was a widow. He did not know what happened  to  the
      family property when her husband died.  She  was  not  living  in  the
      family home rent free. The family property was rented out and she  was
      a benefactor and they decided it was better for her to stay  in  Benin
      and felt that being in the village was not good enough.

  12. In May 2014 Harrison was trying to get into  university  and  doing  a
      JUMP exam. If he was successful he would not be doing the exam  again.
      Mr Kotas referred the sponsor to page 62 of the Claimants' bundle  and
      an entry in the bank statement in April 2014 and asked if he knew what
      she was doing with the money. He said that he did not know.

  13. In re-examination he said that the distance between  Auchi  and  Benin
      was 80 km which was one and a half hours by  transport.  She  did  not
      keep all the money from the rent but had to share it. Her husband  had
      up to five wives and they would receive money. What was intended  when
      they  applied  was  a  family  visit  not  application  for  permanent
      residence. His wife was having baby.

  14. I asked a number of questions. The sponsor said that at  the  date  of
      the application no one else was living with the Claimants. He  started
      sending money in 2012 when he married his wife.  She  ceased  work  in
      2012. Before that she was working part-time. He did not pay  an  agent
      to help with the application. He did not  just  send  money  via  bank
      transfer but also sent it with people.  There were a lot  of  problems
      sending money by hand and so he decided to send it  via  her  account.
      The entries the Claimant's bank statements with the name "Naomi"  next
      to them were for their money transfers. His wife was not receiving any
      other money other than from him in 2013.

  15. Mr Kotas relied on the notice refusing entry clearance. The  Claimants
      were required to demonstrate that they  needed  material  support  for
      their essential needs. The sponsor's  statement  was  very  brief  and
      there was no updated  statement  provided.  There  was  no  letter  or
      witness statement from the Claimants. It was not beyond wit of man  to
      have that sent over. The daughter of the Claimant had not been  called
      to give evidence. The  reality  was  that  when  the  application  was
      submitted the evidence was that the sponsor was sending �100 amounting
      to �50 each and that could not be construed as  suggesting  that  that
      met the essential needs as the Claimant received more from her  rental
      income than from the sponsor and  that  excluded  petty  trading.  The
      first Claimant had children and other relatives  in  Nigeria  and  the
      sponsor's evidence about  level  of  help  from  them  was  hazy.  The
      evidence about the family property was relevant. Her permanent address
      was in Auchi in Nigeria and she apparently had resided  there  for  37
      years and the second  Claimant  for  19  years.  The  bank  statements
      started from September 2013 and there was no real evidence as  to  how
      they coped before that. It did look as if some of the money was  being
      recycled as it came in and out in the same amount which lent weight to
      the ECO's contention that the sponsor was not  responsible  for  their
      essential needs.  The  application  suggested  that  the  moneys  were
      topping up rather than essential.


  16. Mr Emezie submitted that the notice of decision was deficient  and  as
      the First-tier Tribunal remarked there  was  no  attempt  to  exercise
      discretion.  The difficulty that the  First-tier  Tribunal  faced  was
      that there were no questions in relation to how the money  was  spent.
      The sponsor was found credible. It was not  determinative  that  there
      was no witness statement from the Claimant. It was not necessary.  The
      sponsor's wife's evidence would have tallied with sponsor's  evidence.
      It could not have assisted further.  The amount sent  by  the  sponsor
      was �100 monthly. There was no evidence it was �50 each.  The  sponsor
      got more from rental income but that was not the test.  The  test  was
      whether the support was necessary for basic needs. There  was  nothing
      wrong with dependency of choice. In that case it did  not  assist  the
      ECO. There was no evidence that other relatives in Nigeria could help.
      The children had their own problems and needs. The  permanent  address
      was in Auchi because that was where her house was  and  there  was  no
      reason why she should change her address as she knew  the  post  would
      get there. If she lived in Auchi there was no rental income. There was
      no requirement in law for  them  to  show  how  they  were  previously
      receiving money. The sponsor's evidence was that they  were  receiving
      money from his wife before they got married. It was  speculative  that
      money was being recycled. Dependency was a  question  of  fact.  There
      could not be any documentary evidence as to  her  outgoings  as  there
      were no receipts.  Given  her  circumstances,  she  engaged  in  petty
      trading at a stall and the amounts were small and  could  not  satisfy
      her essential needs. There was a deficit which was made up from  money
      received from the sponsor. Her income took care of the rent  from  the
      stall and a number of  things  and  after  paying  that  there  was  a
      shortfall of 20- 25,000 Naira. It was not incredible and the  evidence
      dated back to 2014. He submitted that there had to be a  finding  that
      she was a petty trader and had a rented property.  He  relied  on  his
      skeleton argument. The key point was that it was a question  of  fact.
      There was no authority to say that you had  to  be  wholly  dependent.
      There was other income. She could have said she had no income  but  he
      urged me to find that the sponsor was credible  and  his  account  was
      straight  forward  and   he   had   volunteered   evidence.   Whatever
      discrepancies existed they did not undermine the account. He asked  me
      to allow the appeal.

Discussion and findings

  17. I have taken all of  the  evidence  submitted  by  both  parties  into
      account before coming to my conclusions in this appeal. The  Claimants
      applied for a family permits under Regulation 12  of  the  Immigration
      (EEA) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations"). The first Claimant  is
      the mother of the sponsor's  wife  and  therefore  to  qualify  for  a
      residence card she must demonstrate that she meets the requirements of
      Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations.






  18. Regulation 7 provides in so far that it is  relevant  to  this  appeal
      that:



    7.- (1) Subject to paragraph (2), for the purposes of these Regulations
    the following persons shall be treated as the family members of another
    person -
      (a) his spouse or his civil partner;
      (b) direct descendants of  his, his spouse or his civil  partner  who
    are -
           (i) under 21; or
           (ii) dependants of his,  his spouse or his civil partner;
      (c) dependent direct relatives in his ascending line or  that  of  his
    spouse or his civil partner;
      (d) a person who is to be treated as the family member of  that  other
    person under paragraph (3).

  19. The second Claimant is the brother of the sponsor's wife and is not  a
      family member for the purposes of Regulation 7 of the EEA  Regulations
      as he is not a direct descendant of the sponsor's wife or a  directive
      relative in her ascending line. He therefore has to  demonstrate  that
      he meets the requirements of Regulation 8 of the EEA Regulations as an
      "extended family member". Regulation 8 in so far as it relates to this
      appeal provides that:


    8.-(1) In these Regulations 'extended family member' means a person who
    is not a family member of an EEA national under Regulation 7 (1)(a),(b)
    or (c) and who satisfies the conditions  in  paragraph  (2),(3),(4)  or
    (5).
    (2) A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the person is
    a relative of an EEA national, his spouse or civil partner and -
      (a) the person is residing in a country other than the United Kingdom
    and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a member of his household;
      (b) the  person satisfied the  condition  in  paragraph  (a)  and  is
    accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom and wishes to  join
    him there; or
      (c) the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a),  has  joined
    the EEA national  in the United Kingdom and continues to  be  dependent
    upon him or to be a member of his household.



20. The ECO refused the Claimants  applications  on  28  May  2014  on  the
    grounds that he  was  not  satisfied  that  the  Claimants  needed  the
    financial support of the sponsor  to  meet  their  essential  needs  in
    Nigeria.



21. The test for dependency is the same in relation to family  members  and
    extended family members.  What is required to  be  shown  is  that  the
    family member of a Union citizen needs the  material  support  of  that
    Union citizen in order to meet  their  essential  needs  (see  Bigia  &
    Others Others [2009] EWCA Civ 79 and Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011]
    UKUT 00341).  In Moneke it was further held that  financial  dependency
    should be interpreted  as  meaning  that  the  person  needs  financial
    support from the EEA national or his or her spouse, in  order  to  meet
    his financial needs, not in order to have a certain  level  of  income.
    Provided a person would not be able to meet his or her essential  needs
    without the financial support of the EEA national she or he  should  be
    considered dependent on that national. In those circumstances  it  does
    not matter that the applicant may in addition receive financial support
    or income from other sources and there is  no  need  to  determine  the
    reasons for recourse to the  financial  support  provided  by  the  EEA
    national or to consider whether the applicant is able to support him or
    herself by taking paid employment.

22. Further, in the case of Lim (EEA dependency) Malaysia [2013]  UKUT  437
    the Upper Tribunal held that subject to there being no abuse of  rights
    the jurisprudence of the Court of  Justice  allows  for  dependency  of
    choice.  In Reyes  v  Migrationsverket  (Case  C-423/12)  CJEU  (Fourth
    Chamber), 16 January 2014 it was  held  that  the  fact  that  a  Union
    citizen regularly and for a significant period paid a sum of  money  to
    the descendant necessary in order to support  her  in  the  country  of
    origin was enough to prove that the descendant was in a real  situation
    of dependence.



23. In Rahman [2012] CJEU Case-83/11 (which followed  a  reference  to  the
    CJEU in MR and Ors (EEA extended family members) Bangladesh [2010] UKUT
    449 (IAC)) the CJEU considered the issue  of  dependency  for  extended
    family members. The  CJEU  held  that  in  order  to  fall  within  the
    definition of 'Extended Family Member' on the basis of dependency on an
    EEA national, there is no requirement for the applicant to reside in  a
    country in which the Union  citizen  has  previously  resided,  whether
    recently or at all. The term "Country from which they have come" is, in
    the case of a national of a third state  who  declares  that  he  is  a
    dependent of a Union Citizen, the state in which he (the third  country
    national) was resident on the date when he applied to accompany or join
    the Union citizen".  The CJEU further held that, while ties  may  exist
    without the family member and the Union citizen having resided  in  the
    same state or without there having been dependency on the Union citizen
    shortly before or at the time the Union citizen coming to the UK,  "the
    situation of dependence must exist,  in  the  country  from  which  the
    family member concerned comes, at the time when he applies to join  the
    Union citizen on whom he is dependent." In Ronivon Soares  v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 575 it was  held  that
    the criteria for  being  an  "extended  family  member"  in  Regulation
    8(2)(a) and (c) of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations
    2006 did not extend to dependence on, or  household  membership  of,  a
    spouse or partner of an EEA  national.  Such  dependence  or  household
    membership could only relate to the EEA national.


24. In Boodhoo and another (EEA Regs: relevant evidence) [2013] UKUT  00346
    (IAC)  (Blake  J)  it  was  held  that  neither  section  85A  of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 nor  the  guidance  in  DR
    (Morocco)* [2005] UKAIT 38 regarding  a  previous  version  of  section
    85(5) of that Act has any bearing on an appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006.  In  such  an  appeal,  a
    tribunal has power to consider any evidence which it thinks relevant to
    the substance of the decision,  including  evidence  which  concerns  a
    matter arising after the date of the decision.

25. I gave directions for the resumed hearing pursuant to my  finding  that
    there was an error of law. I  directed  that  the  Claimants  serve  an
    indexed  and  paginated  bundle.  That  was  not  done.  In  order   to
    demonstrate dependency for the purposes of  the  EEA  Regulations,  the
    Claimants rely on a witness statement from the sponsor at pages 1-2  of
    the Claimant's bundle before the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  first
    Claimant's bank statements at pages 48 to 77 of the Claimant's  bundle.
    Further bank statements are  also  to  be  found  in  the  Respondent's
    bundle.

26. The sponsor's witness statement is very brief. The only information  it
    contains in relation to the support provided to  the  Claimants  is  at
    paragraph 3 where the sponsor states: "My mother in law depends largely
    on my wife and I for financial support. We send her money  either  once
    or twice  monthly".   The  first  Claimant's  bank  statements  in  the
    Claimants' bundle cover the period from 28 January 2014 to 22  February
    2015. The bank statements in the ECO's  unpaginated  bundle  cover  the
    period from 1 September 2013 to 31 March 2014.



27. The first Claimant's application form is dated 9 May 2014. She  applied
    for entry as the family member of an EEA  national.  Whilst  Mr  Emezie
    argues that the Claimants were seeking entry as visitors this  was  not
    the application they made. She gave her current working status as self-
    employed (question 57) and stated that her total  monthly  income  from
    all sources of employment after tax was 30,000 Naira (question 58). She
    described her occupation as petty trader (question 59). She stated that
    she also had a monthly income from properties and  rents  amounting  to
    �150 (question 66). She stated that she spent 100  (presumably  pounds)
    on living costs and that she gave none of her monthly income  to  other
    family members. She  was  asked  at  question  137  who  supported  her
    financially and she answered "my children and in-laws". She  stated  in
    answer to question 141 that she was given �100 by family members.



28. The second Claimant's application form states  that  he  is  a  student
    (question 55), that he has no income, that he lives with his mother and
    brother Noah (question 126), that he is supported  by  his  mother  and
    sister and her husband (question 129) and that his mother is given �100
    monthly (question 133). Their applications were accompanied by a letter
    dated 11 May 2014 from JLP Legal stating that bank statements were also
    submitted showing transfers.



29. According to the Respondent's notice of  decision,  the  exchange  rate
    used was �1 to 275 naira. This meant that the figure  of  30,000  Naira
    the first Claimant gave for her  monthly  income  from  self-employment
    equated to �109.09. She then provided information  in  her  application
    form that she had an additional monthly income from properties and rent
    of �150 meaning that her total monthly income was �259.09. The  sponsor
    gave evidence that he sent �100 a  month.  However,  according  to  the
    first Claimant's application form she spent only �100 in  living  costs
    which is less than half of her claimed income from her occupation as  a
    petty trader and income from properties and rent.

30.  I have had regard to the first Claimant's bank statements  which  show
    transfers from the sponsor. No schedule was provided to show the  dates
    and amounts or which transfers were said to be from the sponsor and his
    wife. However, having been through all of the  bank  statements  it  is
    clear that the sponsor transferred on average 20,000 Naira a  month.  I
    therefore accept his evidence that he transfers around �100 a month.



31. However, I find that the Claimants have not demonstrated that the money
    they receive from the sponsor is material support for  their  essential
    needs. There are frequent regular credits  into  the  first  Claimant's
    bank account from other sources. There has been no attempt by way of  a
    witness statement to explain the source of credits or why they  do  not
    cover her needs. The Claimants have not set out in a witness  statement
    what their income and outgoings are and why they require the  sponsor's
    money for their essential needs. The information provided by the  first
    Claimant in her application form states that she spends less on  living
    costs monthly than she receives in income in Nigeria.



32. Further, I found the sponsor's evidence to be less  than  satisfactory.
    Despite the fact that I gave directions for the filing of evidence  and
    it was also clear from my  directions  that  the  sole  issue  in  this
    hearing was  financial  dependency,  no  witness  statement  was  filed
    dealing with the matter. In oral evidence the sponsor did not know  how
    much the first Claimant made from her market stall, how much income she
    received from property, whether she was renting out the whole  property
    and he guessed that the rental income she received would be 2000 Naira.
    He did not satisfy me that he had a full knowledge  of  the  Claimants'
    financial circumstances and their income and outgoings.


33. In the circumstances therefore the Claimants have not shown  that  they
    are or were at the time of the application dependent on the sponsor and
    therefore do not satisfy the requirements of Regulations 7 and 8 of the
    EEA Regulations.



Conclusions:

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rees promulgated on  2  June  2015
contained a material error of law and I set it aside.


The Claimants have failed to meet the requirements of  the  EEA  Regulations
2006.  I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  order  for  anonymity  and  no
application has been made for such an order.
