For the Respondent:    MR G S Hulait the sponsor in person.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Judge Holder, a Judge of the First Tier Tribunal allowed the appeal  of
    respondent in  the  appeal  before  me  against  the  decision  of  the
    appellant refusing her entry clearance to come to the UK as a  domestic
    worker. The appellant was granted permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal by Judge Hodgkinson, a Judge of the First  Tier  Tribunal  for
    reasons given in his decision of 30 December 2014. The Judge said, "The
    grounds argue that the Judge provided inadequate reasons as to  why  he
    concluded that  certain  payments  in  kind  met  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 195 (v), especially bearing  in  mind  that  the  Judge  also
    failed to make a finding on what hours the appellant actually  intended
    to work whilst in the United Kingdom. The  grounds  as  pleaded  reveal
    arguable errors of law and permission is granted on all grounds."

 2. At the hearing before me Mr Stillwell representing the appellant  asked
    for permission to add a  further  ground  of  appeal  namely  that  the
    appellant had not been satisfied that the respondent intended to  leave
    the United Kingdom at the end of her leave to  remain.  I  refused  the
    request for amendment /addition to the grounds of appeal as I felt that
    there had been sufficient opportunity to put  in  this  ground  or  any
    further ground before the hearing of this appeal and  also  because  in
    any event this ground  had  not  been  raised  before  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal.

 3. Mr Stillwell then drew my attention to the fact that  the  decision  to
    refuse had been reviewed by an Entry Clearance Manager and the  Manager
    had found  the  decision  to  be  satisfactory.  My  response  to  that
    argument, if that is an argument, is that there is a statutory right of
    appeal and that right of appeal is neither negated nor diluted  by  any
    review that an Entry Clearance  Manager  may  have  carried  out.  Such
    review process has no relevance to the matter in appeal.

 4. Mr Stillwell then handed me a document entitled  Home  Office  Domestic
    Workers in private household valid from 06 November 2014.  I  asked  Mr
    Stillwell if this document had been made available to  the  First  Tier
    Judge. He said he could not answer that question in the affirmative.  I
    noted that the impugned decision in this case  had  been  made  by  the
    appellant on 4 November 2013 and the reasons for the decision to refuse
    made no mention to this document. Mr Whitwell conceded, quite  properly
    that Guidance does not equate to law or the Rules.

 5. Having heard the sponsor who explained the full factual  background  to
    the case, I was satisfied that Judge Holder's  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal was sound in law and correct on facts. Ms Kaur has been  to  the
    UK many times accompanying her employer the father of  the  sponsor  to
    take care of his personal needs. She has always returned to India  with
    her employer who has indefinite leave to remain in the UK but who  only
    makes visits to be with his son's family  from  time  to  time.  He  is
    getting old and the sponsor's wife cooks for  him  but  the  respondent
    makes sure of his hygiene needs. The sponsor said that reiterated  that
    the finding of the First Tier Judge as made  in  paragraph  14  of  his
    determination was based on facts.

 6. The appeal against the decision of  Judge  Holder  is  dismissed.  With
    great respect, the grounds do not even raise arguable errors of law let
    alone material errors of law. The decision of Judge Holder will stand.
