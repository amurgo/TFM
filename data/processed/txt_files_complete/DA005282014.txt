For the appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Russell promulgated 7.10.14, allowing  the
    claimant's  appeal  against  the  deportation  order  made  on  14.3.14
    pursuant to section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007.  The Judge  heard
    the appeal on 1.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ford refused permission to appeal on 27.10.14
    but when the application was  renewed  to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Warr granted permission to appeal on 15.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before us on 12.3.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 4. For the reasons set out below we found an error of law in the making of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that the determination  of
    Judge Russell should be set aside and remade.

 5. The relevant background to the appeal can be summarised as follows. The
    claimant claims he first came to the UK in 1987. In 2004 he applied for
    indefinite leave to remain on the basis of 14  years  mixed  continuous
    residence in the UK. The application was refused in  2008  and  he  was
    served with notice of liability to be removed as  an  illegal  entrant.
    His appeal against this was allowed and  on  31.10.08  he  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain. However, on 9.10.12 he was convicted on his
    own admission of several counts of possession  of  Class  A  controlled
    drugs with a street value of some �15,000 with  intent  to  supply  and
    sentenced to 3  years  imprisonment  concurrent  on  each  offence.  On
    20.11.12 he was served with notice of liability to deportation.

 6. The family background is that the claimant has three  children  of  his
    own and prior to imprisonment  lived  with  his  partner  and  her  two
    children, regarded as his step-children. The Secretary of State accepts
    that he has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  the  four
    children who were under the age of 18 at the date of decision, 14.3.14.
    Two children and one step-daughter are still under the age of  18,  the
    youngest being 14. Each of the children is a British citizen.

 7. There is no dispute that the claimant is not a British citizen or  that
    the length of his sentence brings him  within  the  'foreign  criminal'
    automatic deportation provisions of section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act
    2007 and that the Secretary of State was therefore obliged  to  make  a
    deportation order, subject only to section 33 and paragraphs  398,  399
    and 399A of the Immigration Rules, the Article 8 ECHR exceptions.

 8. Judge Russell found that the claimant did not meet either the  parental
    relationship exception under paragraph 399(a), or  the  long  residence
    exception under 399A. However, the judge concluded at �34 that it would
    be unduly harsh either for the claimant's  partner  to  follow  him  to
    Nigeria, or to remain in the UK  without  him,  pursuant  to  paragraph
    399(b), and the appeal was allowed on that basis.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Warr noted that  Judge  Russell
    allowed the appeal on the basis that it would be unduly harsh  for  the
    claimant's partner to live in Nigeria, although he  had  not  heard  or
    seen any evidence about the problems that she would face in adapting to
    a new life in Nigeria. "In the premises the respondent's grounds appear
    to raise an arguable legal challenge."

10. The Rule 24 response on behalf of the claimant avers that there  is  no
    arguable material error of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and it is  submitted  that  the  first  ground  of  appeal  is
    fundamentally flawed as the claimant met the exceptions to  deportation
    under paragraph 399(b) of the Immigration Rules. "It is obvious that it
    would be unduly harsh for his partner Pauline Vassel and  his  children
    who are British citizens to relocate to Nigeria after living all  their
    lives in the UK."

11. Somewhat lengthy submissions are made in the Rule 24 response as to the
    effect on the children of the claimant's removal, but  it  ignores  the
    fact that the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  found  that  the
    claimant  did  not  meet  the  exceptions  in  relation   to   parental
    responsibility. There has been no cross-appeal by the claimant or grant
    of permission to appeal that part of the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. In the assessment as to whether there is a material error  of
    law in the decision, those considerations are not directly relevant.

12. It follows that the findings of the First-tier Tribunal in  respect  of
    the children (�24-29) and in relation to long residence  (�35-39)  must
    stand. The only ground on which the claimant's appeal succeeded in  the
    First-tier Tribunal was in respect of his relationship with his partner
    (�30-34). It is that finding which is challenged by  the  Secretary  of
    State.

13. Although at �22  of  the  decision  the  judge  referenced  the  public
    interest considerations applicable to cases involving foreign criminals
    under section 117C of the 2002 Act and noted that  the  deportation  of
    foreign criminals is in the public interest, the decision  contains  no
    reference to either of the  two  exceptions  under  section  117C.  The
    claimant cannot meet the requirements of exception 1,  as  he  has  not
    been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life. The  test  under
    exception 2 is whether the effect of the claimant's deportation on  his
    partner or child is unduly harsh, which overlaps with the consideration
    under 399(b). Following Dube (ss117A-117D) [2015] UKUT 0090  (IAC),  it
    is not an error of law to fail to refer to ss 117A-117D considerations,
    if the judge has applied the test he was supposed to apply according to
    its terms; what matters is substance not form.  In  the  circumstances,
    there is no material error  in  failing  to  specifically  address  the
    exceptions under section 117C.

14. However, we find that there were errors of law in the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal at both �33 and�34. The relevant parts of the  test
    under paragraph 399(b) at issue as applied to the facts  of  this  case
    are whether it would be unduly harsh for the partner to live in Nigeria
    because of compelling circumstances over and above those  described  in
    EX2 of Appendix FM, and unduly harsh for the partner to remain  in  the
    UK without the claimant. EX2 defines insurmountable obstacles  as  very
    significant difficulties which would be faced by the  claimant  or  his
    partner in continuing family life together outside  the  UK  and  which
    could not be overcome or would entail very  serious  hardship  for  the
    claimant or his partner. It  follows  that  something  more  than  very
    serious hardship is required.

15. The Secretary of State accepted that it would be unreasonable to expect
    the children to leave the UK, but pointed out that it was a  matter  of
    choice for the claimant as to whether she would relocate to Nigeria  or
    remain in the UK without him. The only reason proffered by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge for concluding at �34 that it would be unduly harsh
    for the claimant's partner to follow him to Nigeria or remain in the UK
    without him is that she would have to leave her children behind in  the
    UK, which the judge considered to be an insurmountable obstacle.  There
    was no explanation as to why it would be unduly harsh for  his  partner
    to remain in the UK without him. The judge had  already  found  at  �29
    that the claimant played a minimal role in the lives  of  the  children
    and that it would not be unduly harsh for the children to remain in the
    UK without him. There was no evidence that the partner would be  unable
    to care for herself or the children without his presence in the UK.

16. In the circumstances, neither the evidence before the Tribunal nor such
    reasoning as is provided at �33 could justify  the  conclusion  at  �34
    that the requirements of paragraph 399(b) were met as regards it  being
    unduly harsh for the partner to remain in the UK without the appellant.
    The reasoning is inadequate,  if  not  entirely  absent.  The  evidence
    before the Tribunal did not demonstrate that the threshold to meet  the
    test of unduly harsh was met.

17. We therefore set aside that part of the decision only,  preserving  the
    findings and conclusions in relation  to  the  claimant's  relationship
    with his children and the long residence claim. The  claimant  was  not
    legally represented, because of the financial cost, and thus there  was
    nothing to be gained by adjourning the remaking  of  the  decision.  In
    remaking the decision we went on to consider whether it would be unduly
    harsh for the claimant to return to Nigeria with his partner  remaining
    in the UK.

18. In addition to their witness statements, we heard  oral  evidence  from
    both the claimant and his partner Ms Pauline  Vassell,  and  took  into
    account all the other documents in the claimant's bundle.

19. Ms Vassell is expecting a further child to the claimant, with whom  she
    has been in a relationship since 2010.  She  had  a  stillbirth  of  an
    earlier child, following the claimant's imprisonment. She said that the
    stress of losing that child was unbearable and felt it  important  that
    the expected child she is now carrying should be able to bond with  its
    father. She said that both she and the children needed  the  claimant's
    emotional and financial support. He provided support  in  helping  look
    after the children  in  the  home.  He  has  also  been  working  since
    completion of his sentence.  She  said  that  she  had  never  been  to
    Nigeria, knew no one there and explained that all her family is in  the
    UK. She did not know how they would be  able  to  survive  without  the
    claimant as she would effectively be a single parent. The claimant said
    that it would be difficult for him not to be able to see his new  child
    growing up.

20.  Mr  Whitwell  drew  our  attention  to  the  Immigration   Directorate
    Instructions (IDI),  dated  28.7.14,  which,  at  2.5,  relies  on  the
    dictionary  definition  of  'unduly'  as  'excessive'  and  'harsh'  as
    'severe, cruel.' At 2.5.3 the  IDI  states,  "The  greater  the  public
    interest in deportation, the stronger the countervailing  factors  need
    to be to succeed. The impact of deportation on a partner or  child  can
    be harsh, even very harsh, without being unduly harsh, depending on the
    extent of the public interest in deportation and  of  the  family  life
    affected."

21. As explained to the claimant and Ms Vassell, she  is  not  required  to
    leave the UK but the appeal can only succeed if it can be  demonstrated
    that, although they have a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship,  it
    would be both (1) unduly harsh for her to live in Nigeria,  because  of
    compelling circumstances over  and  above  the  test  in  EX2  of  very
    significant difficulties which could not be overcome  or  would  entail
    very serious hardship for the claimant or his partner; and  (2)  unduly
    harsh that she should remain in the UK without him.  As  stated  above,
    something more than very serious hardship and which would  be  akin  to
    excessive and cruel is required.

22. Whilst the claimant would be deported from the UK and separated from Ms
    Vassell and their children, she has a choice as to whether to accompany
    him to Nigeria or remain in the UK. If she decided to remain, she would
    be left in the same sort of position as she was when he was in  prison,
    although she may then have had limited visiting rights. Contact between
    the claimant in Nigeria and Ms Vassell in  the  UK  can  be  maintained
    through occasional visits and by telephone and/or Internet  technology.
    She would be effectively a  single  parent,  raising  the  children  by
    herself; a situation not uncommon in society, and she would  have  such
    State financial and other assistance to  which  she  may  be  entitled.
    Taking all the evidence before us into account, whilst it would be very
    sad for the claimant, Ms Vassell, and the children,  the  circumstances
    of this case do not demonstrate that the high threshold of unduly harsh
    under paragraph 399(b) can be met.

23. It is not necessary to consider Article 8 ECHR separately,  as  it  has
    been held that the Immigration Rules in relation to deportation  are  a
    'complete code.' However, we are satisfied that  any  consideration  of
    Article 8 ECHR family life following the Razgar stepped approach  would
    have reached the same conclusion for the same reasons on an  assessment
    of all the evidence before us. Balancing on the one hand the very  high
    public interest in the claimant's removal as a foreign criminal against
    the rights of the claimant and Ms Vassell on the other, we  would  have
    found that the deportation decision is entirely proportionate.

24. In the circumstances, and for the  reasons  stated  we  find  that  the
    appeal must fail under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights
    grounds.

Conclusions:

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     We set aside the decision.

     We re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

We make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
