                           Entry Clearance Officer
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     The Sponsor in person
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Respondent appeals to the Upper Tribunal against a determination of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Warner)  wherein  it   allowed   the
    Appellant's appeal, on Article  8  grounds,  against  the  Respondent's
    decision to refuse him leave to enter the UK as a fianc�.

 2. For the sake of clarity and continuity I will continue to refer in this
    determination to the Entry Clearance Officer as the Respondent  and  Mr
    Eldeen as the Appellant.

 3. The application was made under Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The Entry Clearance Officer  was not satisfied that the  Appellant  had
    submitted the specified documents required to  show  that  he  met  the
    financial requirements, in particular to show that the  Sponsor  had  a
    gross income of at  least  �18,600  per  annum.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  was  also  not  satisfied  that  the  requirements   regarding
    accommodation were met.

 4. When the matter came before Judge Warner he noted at paragraph  6  that
    Counsel for the Appellant accepted at the  outset  that  the  Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the new Immigration Rules  and  thus
    relied solely on Article 8. Unfortunately nowhere in the  determination
    does it explain why the Appellant did not meet the Rules.

 5. The judge set out the requirements of the relevant parts of Appendix FM
    and in particular  noted  that  6  months  payslips  were  required  in
    relation to salaried employment. Without further explanation the  Judge
    then referred himself to the case of MM & Ors [2013] EWHC 1900  (Admin)
    and set out the relevant paragraphs of  that  case  in  full.  He  then
    proceeded to consider Article 8.

 6. At paragraph 20 the Judge set out  the  contents  of  the  Sponsor  and
    witness's statements and at paragraph 21 set out the oral  evidence  of
    the Sponsor and her witness, her sister.

 7. At paragraph 25 he indicated that he was satisfied that the Sponsor was
    a credible witness. He found that there was evidence of a  genuine  and
    subsisting  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor.   More
    importantly at paragraph 27  the  Judge  found  that  at  the  date  of
    decision the Sponsor held the tenancy of an appropriately sized flat to
    accommodate herself and the Appellant and  at  paragraph  29  expressed
    himself satisfied that at  the  date  of  decision  the  Appellant  was
    employed with an annual salary of �24,000 and had been for the 8 months
    prior to the decision. That he indicated  was  confirmed  by  payslips,
    bank statements and a contract of employment.

 8. I pause  at this stage to indicate that neither I nor Mr  Bramble  were
    clear as to why, given his findings, Judge Warner  did  not  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules but  rather  on  Article  8  grounds
    relying upon the case  of  MM.  The  only  explanation  that  we  could
    conceive was that the Sponsor had not produced the  relevant  documents
    to establish her salary.

 9. The application and grounds to the Upper Tribunal challenge the  appeal
    being allowed on the basis of MM and given the subsequent  guidance  in
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    (IAC) I agree the Judge erred.  However he also erred fundamentally  in
    failinng to give adequate reasons.  If Mr Bramble, a senior Home Office
    Presenting Officer and I could not understand why the Judge reached the
    conclusion he did , the lay Appellant and Sponsor could not be expected
    to. Accordingly, I set aside the determination.   However  the  factual
    findings and credibility findings made after hearing  oral  evidence  I
    preserve. It was agreed that it was appropriate for me to redecide  the
    appeal and that there was no necessity for further evidence.

10. It is clear that with  the  application  to  the  Entry  Clearance  the
    Sponsor had included  five  months  payslips  (April  to  August  2012)
    together with a letter from her employer indicating the  day  when  she
    would be paid for September.  The  application  was  made  before  that
    sixth payslip could be submitted. I was told and I accept on the  basis
    of the Sponsor's evidence to me and  the  contents  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's determination that the sixth payslip was  produced  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

11. That being the case the Appellant was clearly entitled to succeed under
    the substantive rules under Appendix FM. Even if she did  not,  this  I
    find is a case where the Appellant was entitled to succeed in any event
    under paragraph Ex.1.

12. Ex.1(b) provides that the exception applies if the applicant  is  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and
    a British citizen, settled in the UK or in the UK with refugee leave or
    humanitarian protection, and  there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with that partner continuing outside the UK.

13. I am satisfied, as was the First-tier Tribunal that there is a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship between  the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor.
    Given that the Appellant is a  Syrian  national,  and  the  Sponsor  is
    British, I find that in the current climate of a brutal  civil  war  in
    Syria that there are insurmountable obstacles to  the  couple  enjoying
    family life in Syria. Accordingly,  even  if  they  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of appendix FM otherwise, they  are  entitled  to  succeed
    under the exception.

14. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Respondent is allowed  in  that
    the First-tier Tribunal's determination is set aside.  I  redecide  the
    appeal in the Appellant's  favour  such  that  the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the Entry Clearance Officer's decision  is  allowed  under  the
    Rules.
