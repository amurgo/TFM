Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Halim, Counsel, for Wilson Solicitors, London
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Benin born on 5 April 1986.  She appealed
    against the decision of the respondent dated 13 April 2015 refusing her
    leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  the  spouse  of  a  British
    citizen.  The appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Beg
    on 12 April 2016 and dismissed in a decision promulgated  on  15  April
    2016.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was  made  and  permission  was
    granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer on 8 September 2016.
     The permission states that  the  judge  did  not  expressly  refer  to
    Appendix FM-SE and all the requirements of paragraph 10(a).  It  states
    that the appellant at  the  First-tier  hearing  stated  that  she  had
    submitted all the required documentary evidence with  the  application.
    The appellant's solicitor's letter has listed the submitted  documents.
    The permission  states  that  the  judge  erred  in  finding  that  the
    appellant can only rely on the rental income from the tenancy which was
    in existence for the entire 12 month period prior to  the  application.
    The permission states that the judge also  erred  when  she  asked  for
    documentary evidence that the rental income had been declared to  HMRC.
     The permission states that it is arguable that the  judge  misdirected
    herself in these matters and that all the grounds are arguable.

 3. There  is  a  Rule  24  response  which  states  that  the  appellant's
    representative at the First-tier hearing  conceded  that  not  all  the
    relevant documentary evidence had been provided by the appellant.  This
    is at paragraph 7 of the decision.  The response states that that  fact
    is  determinative  of  the  outcome  of  the  appeal.   Appendix  FM-SE
    paragraph D clearly requires all the evidence to be submitted with  the
    application.  The response states that the  remedy  would  be  for  the
    appellant to make a fresh  application  ensuring  compliance  with  the
    requirements.

The Hearing

 4. Counsel for the  appellant  submitted  that  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules have been satisfied relating to the income  threshold
    of the appellant's husband and that all the  evidence  was  before  the
    First-tier Judge.  We pointed out that at the hearing  the  appellant's
    representative conceded that all the evidence had  not  been  provided.
    We were referred to the grounds of application at paragraph  12.   They
    state that the mortgage statement, the personal bank statements  and  3
    tenancy agreements were all supplied and this is what is  required  for
    rental income in terms of the Rules.  Counsel submitted that all  these
    items are in the appellant's First-Tier bundle.  He submitted that  the
    respondent is wrong to rely on the concession, as although at paragraph
    7 the judge states that the appellant's  representative  accepted  that
    all the relevant documentary  evidence  had  not  been  provided,   her
    findings were not based on that concession, as in  that  paragraph  the
    judge grapples with the evidence before him.  Counsel submitted that he
    does  not  accept  that  the  appellant's  representative   made   that
    concession.

 5. Counsel submitted that the judge's findings are  wrong.   There  is  no
    requirement for HMRC  to  confirm  that  the  rental  income  has  been
    declared and it is wrong to say that the tenancy agreements have to  be
    for the 12 month period before the date of application.  As long as the
    tenancy agreements are in force that is sufficient.  He submitted  that
    the terms of the Rules have been satisfied by the appellant.

 6. Counsel submitted that paragraph 10 (a) is quoted in  the  grounds.  We
    did not have the 3 tenancy  agreements  referred  to  in  the  decision
    before us, we only had one. We were handed the other 2 and they seem to
    have formed part of the appellant's bundle.

 7. The Presenting Officer made his  submissions  submitting  that  in  his
    record of proceedings there is no mention  of  the  concession  by  the
    appellant's representative and that what was before the judge may  have
    been sufficient for the rental income for the 12 month period.

 8. Counsel submitted that the judge has referred to phantom provisions  in
    the Rules.  He submitted that the application meets the  terms  of  the
    Rules and the judge misconstrued what the Rules require.  He  submitted
    that had the judge not done this, the claim would have succeeded.

 9. The Presenting Officer submitted that he is  relying  on  his  Rule  24
    response.

10. He submitted that there are bank statements, a mortgage  statement  and
    evidence of ownership of the property rented  out,  which  is  what  is
    required as  evidence  of  income  from  rental  properties  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  He submitted that it  is  not  clear  what  tenancy
    agreements were before the judge but the respondent is relying  on  the
    concession.  He submitted that there is an error by the judge  as  HMRC
    documents are not required but this is not a material error.

11. The Presenting Officer then referred us to the documents submitted with
    the application and pointed  to  tenancy  agreements  which  have  been
    entered into after the application was made and agreements that  lasted
    only for 6 months.  The date of application was 17 February 2015.   One
    of the agreements is dated in December 2015, one in  June  2015,  2  in
    April 2015, one in June 2014 which is only for a 6 month period, one in
    June 2012 and one in February 2013.  The latter  2  were  entered  into
    before the application was made but they do not  continue  for  a  long
    enough period to be valid at the date of application.

12. He submitted therefore that if the judge had dealt correctly with these
    tenancy agreements there would still be a shortfall of  �5,400  in  the
    appellant's spouse's income.

13. We were then referred to the refusal letter.   The  Presenting  Officer
    submitted that the appellant's employment income cannot be  taken  into
    account as at the date of application he had not been in employment for
    6 months or more at Climate Energy Ltd.  I was referred to Appendix FM-
    SE (a) (ii) - "In respect of salaried employment  in  the  UK  all  the
    following evidence must be provided: payslips covering  any  period  of
    salaried employment in a period of 12  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application, if the  applicant  has  been  employed  by  their  current
    employer for less than 6 months or in the financial year relied on by a
    self employed person."  He submitted that the  appellant's  spouse  had
    only been employed for 3 months and there is no evidence of  any  other
    employment before he was employed by Climate Energy Ltd.  He  submitted
    that the Rules set out what is required and it is clear that  there  is
    not sufficient documentation for the Rules to be satisfied relating  to
    the appellant's husband's salaried employment.  He submitted that  even
    if  the  rental  income  is  satisfactory,  the  appellant's   spouse's
    employment income is not satisfactory.  He submitted  that  because  of
    this any errors  made  by  the  judge  are  not  material  errors.   He
    submitted that the respondent did not accept the employment position at
    the date of the application and that  is  made  clear  by  the  refusal
    letter.

14. Counsel submitted that at paragraph 5 of the decision the judge  states
    that  the  appellant  said  he  earned  �12,000  per  annum  from   his
    employment.   At paragraph 6 the judge states that it is common  ground
    that at the date of application the sponsor  earned  �12,000  from  his
    employment.  This is not being argued.  What is being argued is that he
    had only been in this employment for 3 months and there is no  evidence
    of any previous employment during that year which is what  is  required
    by the Immigration Rules.  The issue  in  this  claim  is  whether  the
    appellant's spouse earned �18,600 per annum at the date of  application
    and this is subject to the terms of the Rules.

15. We asked Counsel if there is any evidence of any other work  undertaken
    by the appellant's spouse before he was employed by Climate Energy Ltd.
     He said he had  no  additional  evidence.   The  appellant's  spouse's
    employment started on 8 December 2014 and the application was  made  in
    February 2015.  Counsel submitted that all that is required in terms of
    the Rules are payslips of the spouse's employment up  to  the  date  of
    application.   That  is  not  what  Appendix  FM-SE  states.   If   the
    appellant's spouse has been employed for less than 6  months,  payslips
    have to be provided for any period of salaried employment in the period
    of 12 months prior to the date of application.  These payslips were not
    available so the appellant's representative's concession at the hearing
    was correct.  All the documents had not been provided.

16. Counsel submitted that this has never been an issue but it clearly  has
    when the refusal letter is considered.

17. Counsel submitted that all the tenancy agreements are  rolling  tenancy
    agreements and this  was  submitted  at  the  First-tier  hearing.   He
    submitted that the judge misdirected herself as far as  the  Rules  are
    concerned and there is a material error of law in the judge's decision.

Decision and Reasons

18. At paragraph 7 of the decision the judge states  that  the  appellant's
    representative accepted that all the relevant documentary evidence  had
    not been provided.  The judge then makes an error stating  that  it  is
    only the tenancy agreement which relates to the 12 month period  before
    the date of application which can be taken into account. At the hearing
    it  was  stated  that  the  tenancy  agreements  are  rolling   tenancy
    agreements.  That being  the  case  the  income  from  the  appellant's
    husband's rental property may be  sufficient.  There  is  no  need  for
    documentary evidence that the rental income has been declared  to  HMRC
    and this is an error by the judge.

19. The other issue brought out in the refusal letter is that  although  at
    the date of application the appellant's husband was earning �12,000 per
    annum he had only been  in  that  employment  for  3  months  when  the
    application was made.  The judge is correct to say that at the date  of
    application the sponsor earned �12,000 from his employment, but he  had
    only been employed for 3 months.  What was therefore required in  terms
    of Appendix FM-SE(a)(ii)  are  payslips  for  any  period  of  salaried
    employment in the period of 12 months prior to the date of application.
     The refusal letter makes it clear that this is an issue and it  states
    that as the sponsor had not been in employment for 6 months or more  at
    the time the appellant applied, his employment at  Climate  Energy  Ltd
    cannot be considered for contribution towards the  financial  threshold
    requirement.  The financial  threshold  cannot  be  satisfied  in  this
    application.  There are some errors in the decision by  the  First-tier
    Judge but these are not material errors.  The application  cannot  meet
    the terms of the Rules.

20. The judge dealt adequately with Article 8 of ECHR at paragraphs 8 and 9
    of the decision.



Notice of Decision

21. There is no material error of law.  Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Beg's decision, promulgated on 15 April 2016 must stand.

22. Anonymity has not been directed.
