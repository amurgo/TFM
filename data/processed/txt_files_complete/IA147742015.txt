Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr Gaisford, counsel
For the Appellant:     Mr Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This matter comes before me for consideration  as  to  whether  or  not
    there is a material error of law in  the  determination  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Samimi ("the FTTJ") promulgated on 15 January  2016,  in
    which the FTTJ allowed the appellant's appeal against the  cancellation
    of his leave to remain and refusal of leave to enter in accordance with
    paragraph 321A(2) of the Immigration Rules.


 2. For ease of  reference  and  continuity,  throughout  this  decision  I
    maintain the descriptions of the parties as appellant  and  respondent,
    as set out in the FTTJ's decision, although  it  is  the  Secretary  of
    State who pursues this appeal.

 3. No anonymity direction was made in the First-tier Tribunal  but,  given
    my findings, the appellant is entitled to  such  a  direction  in  this
    Tribunal.

Background

 4. The appellant had been granted leave to remain as an entrepreneur under
    Tier 1 of  the  Points  Based  Scheme.   He  had  submitted  with  that
    application for leave dated 23  October  2013  an  Educational  Testing
    Service (ETS) certificate.  ETS  later  provided  the  respondent  with
    information indicating that his certificate was invalid. As  a  result,
    the appellant's leave to remain was cancelled and he was refused  leave
    to enter the UK under paragraph 321A(2) of the Rules. the decision  was
    also made under paragraph 320(7A) of the Rules.


 5. The appealed against that decision. The FTTJ allowed his appeal on  the
    ground that the respondent had not satisfied the burden of proving that
    the appellant had submitted an English  language  certificate  obtained
    through deception in the manner suggested by the respondent.

 6. The respondent sought permission to appeal and this was granted in  the
    following terms:

           "...


           2. The grounds requesting permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
           Tribunal argue that the judge  erred  in  applying  too  high  a
           standard  of  proof  upon  the  respondent  in  respect  of  the
           deception issue.


           3. Bearing in mind the decision in the case of SM  and  Qadir  v
           Secretary of State for the Home Department  (ETS  -  Evidence  -
           Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229 (IAC), which was  promulgated
           after the instant decision it is arguable that the judge applied
           an  inappropriate  standard  of  proof  and  this  infected  the
           decision making process."


           4. I grant permission on the grounds set out in the respondent's
    application."

 7. Hence the matter comes before me.

Submissions

 8. For the Secretary of State, Mr Kotas submitted the FTTJ had applied too
    high a standard of proof, namely "a high degree of probability"  rather
    than the balance of probabilities [11]. It could not  be  inferred  the
    FTTJ was referring to the need to give  the  matter  anxious  scrutiny.
    The FTTJ had  erred  in  finding  that  the  evidence  was  generalised
    information [8].  In SM & Qadir, paragraph 68, the Upper  Tribunal  had
    found that the generic  witness  statements  had  satisfied  the  test.
    Where ETS had invalidated the test result (as  evidenced  here  in  the
    toolkit before the FTTJ), there was evidence of  proxy  test-taking  or
    impersonation.  The FTTJ had failed to give  adequate  reasons  to  the
    contrary. The FTTJ had erred in finding the  two  witnesses  statements
    were "generic" and "in no way relate to the Appellant's case". This was
    also the case with regard to the findings  about  the  ETS  spreadsheet
    extract. Read together, they provided a  clear  explanation.  The  FTTJ
    also failed to take account of the fact  the  appellant's  account  was
    entirely uncorroborated.  The  FTTJ  relied,  inappropriately,  on  the
    appellant's English language ability [7]. Further, there may be reasons
    why a person who was able to speak English to the required level  might
    cause a proxy candidate to undertake the test.  The FTTJ had failed  to
    give adequate reasons for holding that  a  person  who  speaks  English
    would have no reason to secure a test certificate by deception.

 9. For the appellant, Mr Gaisford referred to paragraph 101 of SM & Qadir;
    the FTTJ had understood the case for the respondent [5-7]. It was right
    to describe the statements of Mr Milligan and Ms Collings  as  generic.
    The FTTJ had referred appropriately to R (Gazi) v SSHD (ETS -  judicial
    review) IJR [2015] UKUT 00327 (IAC) which was upheld in SM & Qadir.  In
    both those cases the absence of specific evidence had been described as
    being "mildly astonishing".  The FTTJ had been entitled  to  take  into
    account the appellant's answers in  interview  [6]  which  provided  an
    innocent explanation.  There was no challenge to  the  authenticity  of
    the appellant's previous credentials [7] (paragraph 101 of SM & Qadir).
     It was submitted that the FTTJ had  used  the  term  "high  degree  of
    probability" in the context of addressing the facts; by  inference  she
    had applied the right standard of proof. The respondent had  failed  to
    rebut the appellant's innocent  explanation.  In  the  absence  of  any
    rebuttal, the allegation falls away (Gazi and SM & Qadir).

10. Mr Gaisford submitted in the alternative that, if there were  an  error
    of law with regard to the standard of proof, it was immaterial  because
    the FTTJ had addressed all the evidence  and  the  respondent  had  not
    reached the evidential threshold required.  The facts could  only  lead
    to a conclusion that the respondent had not demonstrated deception.

11. Both parties agreed the appellant had not attended the  hearing  before
    the FTTJ. This is consistent  with  the  FTTJ's  observation  that  the
    hearing proceeded "on the basis of submissions only".

Discussion

12. I am satisfied the FTTJ's decision contains a misdirection  of  law  in
    her assessment of the evidential weight to be given to the evidence  in
    support of the respondent's position that the appellant  had  submitted
    an English language certificate obtained through  deception  [11].  She
    found that the respondent had not "satisfied the burden of proof  to  a
    high degree of probability" (my emphasis).


13. The parties are not in dispute that this is too  high  a  standard  and
    that it should be the balance of  probabilities,  the  civil  standard.
    Paragraph 58 of SM & Qadir sets out the position:


         "It is well established that proof of dishonesty on the part of the
         immigrant concerned is required in order to establish either "false
         representations" or "false documents" under paragraph 321A  of  the
         Rules:  see  AA  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2010] EWCA  Civ  773,  at  [44]  and  [51]  especially.
         Following the consumption of large quantities of judicial ink,  the
         legal rule which has emerged with unmistakable clarity is  that  in
         civil proceedings there is but one standard of proof, namely  proof
         on the balance of probabilities.  One of the  clearest  expositions
         of this rule is found in the judgment of Richards LJ  in  R  (N)  v
         Mental Health Review Tribunal (Northern Region) [2006] QB  468,  at
         [62]:


             "Although there is a single civil standard  of  proof  on  the
             balance of probabilities, it is flexible in  its application.
             In particular, the more serious the  allegation  or  the  more
             serious the consequences if  the  allegation  is  proved,  the
             stronger must be the evidence before a  court  will  find  the
             allegation proved on the balance of  probabilities.  Thus  the
             flexibility of the standard lies not in any adjustment to  the
             degree of probability required for an allegation to be  proved
             (such that a more serious allegation has to  be  proved  to  a
             higher degree of probability), but in the strength or  quality
             of the evidence that will  in  practice  be  required  for  an
             allegation to be proved on the balance of probabilities."


         In short, as emphasised by Lord Carswell in Re D [2008] UKHL 33, at
         [28], the fundamental judicial task is to  decide  whether,  having
         regard to the  context,  the  evidence  adduced  is  of  sufficient
         cogency to warrant the conclusion that the burden of proof has been
         discharged to the civil standard."


14. For the avoidance of doubt I am unable to accept the submission for the
    appellant that it could be inferred  that  the  FTTJ  had  applied  the
    correct standard. It is plain from her words that she did not.


15. I turn to the issue of whether that misdirection  is  material.  In  so
    doing I have regard to the material  which  was  before  the  FTTJ,  as
    follows:


           a. Notice of decision with reasons.
           b.  Immigration  Officer's   explanatory   statement   including
              interview record.
           c. Witness statement of Ms Collings dated 23 June 2014.
           d. Witness statement of Mr Millington dated 23 June 2014.
           e. Extract from a Look Up Tool.
           f. The appellant's witness statement dated 12 November 2015
           g. IELTS Test report form dated 8 October 2015 in  the  name  of
              the appellant  (with  photograph),  stamped  by  the  British
              Council in Islamabad.


16. In SM & Qadir, the respondent relied on the statements of  Ms  Collings
    and Mr Millington as she did in the present case before the FTTJ. These
    are described in SM & Qadir  as  "generic  evidence"  [13].  The  Upper
    Tribunal identifies the evidence before it in SM & Qadir at  paragraphs
    10-13. This included [10] the "computerised spreadsheet entries derived
    from  the  "Look  up  Tool"  relating  to  the  two  Appellants,   with
    accompanying explanatory witness statement".   In the present case  the
    respondent has not produced an explanatory witness statement, merely  a
    copy of an extract from a spreadsheet which is marked in manuscript  as
    being "extract from Look Up Tool".  It is not clear whether this  is  a
    complete copy of the screenprint because the box on the right hand side
    of the screenprint is incomplete. It is not clear whether there are any
    missing entries from  the  spreadsheet.  There  is  no  explanation  or
    statement to indicate how this screenprint was obtained (unlike in SM &
    Qadir where the UT was provided with the statement  of  a  Home  Office
    employee, Mr Green). The  document  cites  the  appellant's  first  and
    family names, his date of birth and nationality. It refers to his  test
    as "invalid". Thus, extrapolating the evidence of Mr Green in  the  UT,
    insofar  as  the  document  refers  to  the  appellant  accurately   it
    demonstrates the Home Office holds a record that ETS has  recorded  his
    test results as invalid.

17.  The  respondent  also  relies  on  the  explanatory  statement  of  an
    Immigration Officer which sets  out  the  history  of  the  appellant's
    encounter on seeking entry to the UK on 30 March 2015 and  his  contact
    with other immigration officers. The report also includes  a  purported
    verbatim record of interview with the  appellant  (notwithstanding  the
    explanatory statement is dated 14 September 2015, some six months after
    the encounter).  There is no  explanation  as  to  the  source  of  the
    interview record.  This statement appears to have been prepared for the
    appeal before the FTTJ.  It is not therefore a contemporaneous  record.
    Importantly, the statement has been signed per pro the claimed  author,
    namely the Immigration  Officer  who  made  the  immigration  decision.
    There is no indication of the status or  position  of  the  person  who
    signed on the officer's behalf.  It is not clear on what the content is
    based and whether it has been  checked  for  accuracy  by  the  author;
    indeed it appears not since it has been signed by someone else.  Little
    weight should be given to  this  record  given  the  frailties  I  have
    identified.

18. In any event, taking the interview record at face value, concerns arise
    from the content of it.  According to that record,  the  appellant  was
    asked only three specific questions about taking the  English  language
    test in the UK.  These are as follows:

         "Q. Have you ever taken an English language test in the UK?


         A. Yes - sometime in 2012.


         Q. Where?


         A. I do not remember the address it was in Whitechappel  [sic].   I
         found the test on the internet. I do  not  know  the  name  of  the
         college either. The fee was approx �100 - �120.


         Q. Did you complete the test yourself?


         A. Yes"

19. If this is an accurate record  of  the  interview  (as  the  respondent
    suggests), it is notable that the appellant gave more information  than
    was required to answer the questions posed of him. By way  of  example,
    he not only confirmed that he had taken a test in the UK but  the  year
    he took it.  Also, when asked where he took it, whilst admitting he did
    not remember the address, he gave the area  of  London  and  additional
    information for which he had not been asked, such  as  the  approximate
    fee.


20. The Immigration Officer criticises the appellant  as  follows  for  his
    answers given in interview:


         "On the subject of English language tests, the passenger claimed he
         took his first English language  test  at  the  British  Consul  in
         Lahore, Pakistan in 2008 and was able to speak in some detail about
         the process but when questioned  about  the  test  which  had  been
         declared invalid, he was much more vague only being able to say  it
         had been "sometime in 2012" and failing  to  name  the  college  or
         provide the address other than saying it was in Whitechapel.   When
         challenged on his invalid ETS certificate he claimed  that  it  was
         not invalid at all and that  he  did  not  know  anything  about  a
         problem."


    This statement misrepresents the  appellant's  evidence  in  interview.
    When the appellant provided, in interview, information about  the  test
    modules he was referring to the test he took in London, not to the  one
    he took in Pakistan (as  evidenced  by  his  appeal  statement).   This
    explanation is wholly reasonable because the immigration officer,  when
    questioning the appellant about the "invalid" ELT, did not  specify  to
    which English language test he was  referring.  This  was  despite  the
    Officer being aware that the appellant had taken tests in both Pakistan
    and London.  It is therefore understandable that the parties were  each
    referring to different tests.  Thus  the  Officer  is  not  correct  in
    saying that the appellant "was able to speak in some detail  about  the
    process" in Pakistan; in fact the  appellant  was  speaking  about  the
    process in London when he took the ELT.  Thus the Immigration Officer's
    conclusion that the appellant was "much more vague" about the  test  in
    London is unsupported by the interview evidence.

21. I bear in mind paragraph 68 of SM & Qadir:


         "68. As our analysis and conclusions in the  immediately  preceding
         section make clear, we  have  substantial  reservations  about  the
         strength and quality of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence.   Its
         shortcomings are manifest. On the other hand, while bearing in mind
         that the context is one of alleged deception, we must be mindful of
         the comparatively  modest  threshold  which  an  evidential  burden
         entails. The calls for an evaluative assessment on the part of  the
         tribunal [sic]. By an admittedly narrow  margin  we  are  satisfied
         that the Secretary of State has discharged this burden.  The effect
         of this is that there is a burden, again an evidential one, on  the
         Appellants of raising an innocent explanation."


22. Given the concerns in the present case about the copy of  the  Look  Up
    Tool spreadsheet, the Immigration Officer's explanatory  statement  and
    the  Officer's   unfounded   conclusion   that   the   appellant   gave
    comparatively vague answers about the ELT in London, I  find  that  the
    misdirection of law by the FTTJ is not a material error of  law.   Even
    if the FTTJ had applied the correct  standard  of  proof,  the  outcome
    would have been the same: the evidence is not such that the  respondent
    has discharged the evidential burden of proving that the appellant used
    deception to obtain his ELT certificate.  Nor, given the  frailties  in
    the copy of the look up tool screenprint and the Immigration  Officer's
    explanatory statement, is the generic  evidence  alone  (including  the
    look up tool) sufficient  to  satisfy  the  evidential  burden  on  the
    respondent: in SM &  Qadir  the  Upper  Tribunal  had  the  benefit  of
    additional evidence over and above that available to the FTTJ  in  this
    case.


23. For these reasons, I find  that  the  misdirection  of  law  is  not  a
    material one and I uphold the decision of the FTTJ.

Decision

24. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of a material error of law.


25. The decision of the FTTJ is upheld.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Fee Award
The FTTJ did not make a fee award. No submissions were  made  on  the  issue
and the FTTJ's decision not to make a fee award is therefore upheld.
