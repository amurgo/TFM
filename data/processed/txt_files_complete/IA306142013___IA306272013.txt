                                                Notice sent on 1st June 2015

                                     And

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


        Decision on Appellant's application to withdraw their appeals

1.    On 24 April 2015, the Appellants were granted permission to appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.

2.    By a letter dated 14 May 2015,  Pioneer  Solicitors,  the  Appellants'
    representatives, informed the Tribunal that the Appellants did not wish
    to proceed with the appeals any further and that they  were  submitting
    fresh applications. The letter requested the Upper  Tribunal  to  treat
    the appeals as withdrawn.

3.    I  have  decided  to  treat  the  letter  as  an  application  by  the
    Appellants to withdraw their case.

4.    The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (Upper  Tribunal
    Rules) do not make provision for a party to withdraw its  appeal.  Rule
    17 of the Upper Tribunal Rules provides for a  party  to  withdraw  its
    case before the Upper Tribunal, with the consent of the Tribunal.

5.     The  Upper  Tribunal  hereby  consents  to  the  withdrawal  by   the
    Appellants of their cases.

6.    This means that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal stands.

7.    The hearing on 8 June 2015 will therefore be vacated.
