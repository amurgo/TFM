Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Daykin, instructed by Makka Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This decision follows a hearing on 15 December 2020 which was  not,  in
    the event, contested by Mr Melvin on behalf of the  respondent.   As  I
    shall endeavour to explain relatively briefly, it is a  case  in  which
    the correct outcome could not be clearer, even  though  the  respondent
    might have been correct in the decisions she reached as long ago as  25
    October 2018.


 2. The appellants are Bangladeshi nationals who were born  on  23  October
    1968, 7  January  1995  and  12  June  1998  respectively.   The  first
    appellant is the mother of the second and third appellants.  The  first
    appellant is married to Abdul Ahad, a British citizen who was  born  on
    18 December 1963.  Mr Ahad is  the  father  of  the  second  and  third
    appellants.

 3. The appellants were admitted to the United Kingdom on 15 January  2014.
    They each held entry clearance which was valid from 19 December 2013 to
    19 March 2016.  The first appellant's entry clearance was as a  spouse;
    the second  and  third  appellants'  entry  clearances  were  those  of
    dependent children.

 4. On 12 March 2016,  the  appellants  applied  for  Indefinite  Leave  to
    Remain.  Their applications for ILR were refused but they were  granted
    further leave to remain until 10 August 2018.

 5. On 5 July 2018, the appellants applied for ILR once again.   The  first
    appellant's application was made under paragraph 287 of the Immigration
    Rules.  The second and third appellants' applications were  made  under
    paragraph 298 of those Rules.  These provisions, rather than  those  in
    Appendix FM, continue to apply due to the  transitional  provisions  in
    paragraph A320 of the Immigration Rules.

 6. There was a single ground of refusal, common to each of the appellants.
     It was not accepted by the respondent that  the  family's  income  was
    sufficient to maintain and accommodate them to the  level  required  by
    the Immigration Rules.  That level  is  the  level  of  adequacy  which
    applies to cases under Part 8 of the  Immigration  Rules  and  not  the
    level which has come to be known as  the  Minimum  Income  Requirement,
    under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  What the  appellants  were
    required  to  show,  therefore,  was  that  the  household  income  was
    sufficient to pay the rent and council tax on the family home and  that
    there would be a surplus thereafter which was either  greater  than  or
    equal to the amount which would be  received  by  a  family  on  income
    support.   That  is  the  income  support  'yardstick'  considered  and
    approved in cases such as KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 65,  Yarce  [2012]
    UKUT 425 (IAC) and French v ECO (Kingston) [2011] EWCA Civ 35.

 7. In her decisions of 23 October 2018, the respondent concluded that  the
    family's income, less rental costs of �1107.68, resulted in  a  surplus
    of �230.65 per week.  This was some �35.45  per  week  lower  than  the
    income  support  yardstick,  and  the  applications  were   accordingly
    refused.  The respondent went on to consider whether there  were  other
    provisions in the Rules which might avail the  appellants,  or  whether
    their removal would otherwise be disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR,
    but I need not consider the reasoning in those sections of the  refusal
    letters in any greater detail.

 8. A judge of the FtT dismissed the appellants' appeals.  His decision was
    found to be erroneous in law by Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic.  It was set
    aside, in part, and the matter was retained in the Upper  Tribunal  for
    the decisions on the appeals to be remade.  UTJ Kekic noted  that  what
    remained for consideration was whether  the  appellants  were  able  to
    establish adequate maintenance at the date  of  hearing  and,  if  not,
    whether their removal would be contrary to Article 8 ECHR.

 9. At the outset of the remaking hearing, I asked Ms Daykin and Mr  Melvin
    whether it was accepted that the appropriate date for  my  enquiry  was
    the date of the hearing.  Ms Daykin agreed that it was.  Mr Melvin  was
    initially minded to submit that the focus of  the  Tribunal's  enquiry,
    under the Immigration Rules, should be on the date of the  respondent's
    decision.  I suggested to him,  however,  that  there  was  nothing  in
    either paragraph 287 or 298  which  confined  my  enquiry  to  a  fixed
    historic timeline, as is so often the case  in  Appendix  FM  cases  or
    those under the Points Based System.  Having considered the  paragraphs
    of the Rules for himself, Mr  Melvin  agreed,  and  accepted  that  the
    Tribunal should consider for itself whether the appellants were able to
    meet the Income Support threshold at  the  date  of  the  hearing,  and
    therefore on the up-to-date evidence presented.

10. I then asked the advocates to assist  me  with  the  relevant  figures,
    starting with the Income Support figure.  It was accepted on all  sides
    that the appropriate figure to use was the current rate,  and  not  the
    rate at the date of the respondent's  decision.   It  was  also  agreed
    between the parties that the appropriate figures were as follows.   The
    first appellant and the sponsor, being a  couple  both  aged  over  18,
    would  receive  �116.80  per  week  in  Income  Support.   The   second
    appellant, being a single adult over 25,  would  receive  �74.37.   The
    third appellant, being a single adult under 25, would  receive  �58.90.
    No additional sums were to  be  included.   In  total,  therefore,  the
    appellants were required to show a surplus income, after housing costs,
    of �250.07 per week.

11. It was then agreed that the relevant housing cost was absent  from  the
    bundle.  It was clear, however, that the respondent had used  a  figure
    of �1107.68 in the first appellant's refusal letter.  That  figure  was
    for an address in London E3, which the  appellants  (and  the  sponsor)
    demonstrably  continue  to  occupy  together,  as  a  family.   In  the
    circumstances, Mr Melvin was  prepared  to  accept  that  the  relevant
    figure was likely to be �1107.68 or slightly  more.   Translating  that
    monthly figure into a weekly figure results in a sum  of  �255.62.   In
    order to  satisfy  the  Rules,  therefore,  the  appellants  require  a
    household income of �505.69 (�250.07  +  255.62)  per  week.   That  is
    �26,295.88 per annum or �2191.32 per month.

12. I then asked Ms Daykin to take me through the evidence  in  the  bundle
    showing the earnings of the sponsor and the  appellants.   The  sponsor
    was said to earn �15,815 per annum.  The first appellant  was  said  to
    earn �13,200 per annum.  The second and the third appellant,  who  work
    in identical roles, earn salaries of  �19,773  per  annum.   Ms  Daykin
    helpfully confirmed  that  these  sums  combined  to  give  an  overall
    household income of �68,561.

13. Mr Melvin was content - in light of the detailed evidence in the bundle
    - to accept that the earnings were as claimed.  On that basis,  it  was
    clear that the combined household income is more than double that which
    is required by the relevant Immigration Rules.   Although  the  sponsor
    and the appellants were available to give evidence via Skype, Mr Melvin
    confirmed that he had  no  questions  for  them  and  that  he  had  no
    submissions in answer to Ms Daykin's.  He was content for me  to  allow
    the  appeals  on  Article  8  ECHR  grounds  on  the  basis  that   the
    requirements of paragraphs 287 and 298 of the  Immigration  Rules  were
    met and that there was accordingly no public interest in the removal of
    the appellants: TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 refers, at [34].

14. It was in these circumstances that  I  was  able  to  indicate  at  the
    hearing that the appeals would  be  allowed  for  reasons  which  would
    follow in writing.

15. I must add this.  My jurisdiction is limited to considering whether the
    respondent's decision is unlawful under section 6 of the  Human  Rights
    Act 1998.  I have  no  jurisdiction  to  allow  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is important to  recognise,  however,  that  the
    appeals  have  been  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds  because   the
    requirements of paragraphs 287 and 298 of  the  Immigration  Rules  are
    accepted - on all sides - to be met.   I  make  that  point  explicitly
    because it must result in the appellants being granted ILR and not  the
    limited leave which would otherwise follow from an appeal being allowed
    on human rights grounds.  That is not a direction; it is an observation
    for the respondent's benefit.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT was set aside as  it  was  erroneous  in  law.   The
decision on the appeals is remade by allowing each appeal  on  human  rights
grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
