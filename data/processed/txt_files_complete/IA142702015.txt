For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Callow sitting at Taylor House on 26  August
    2016) dismissing his appeal on human rights (Article  8  ECHR)  grounds
    against the decision of the respondent made on 22 March 2014 to  refuse
    to grant him leave to remain in the UK,  and  against  her  concomitant
    decision to remove him from the UK via directions under section  47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do  not  consider
    that the appellant requires anonymity  for  these  proceedings  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background Facts

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose date of birth is 3 April
    1985.  He came to the United Kingdom as a student on 13 March 2011, and
    his entry clearance as a student expired on 22 December  2014.   Before
    the expiry of his student visa, the  appellant  applied  for  leave  to
    remain on private life  grounds,  without  furnishing  any  details  to
    support a private life claim under Rule 276ADE.  The appellant also did
    not identify any exceptional circumstances which could potentially lead
    to him being granted Article 8 relief outside the Rules.

 3. As was entirely predictable in  these  circumstances,  the  appellant's
    application was refused, and the Secretary of State made a  concomitant
    decision to remove him.  However,  by  way  of  appeal,  the  appellant
    relied on the fact that he had now established family life  in  the  UK
    with a British citizen.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant was represented by Counsel at the  hearing  before  Judge
    Callow.  The respondent was not represented.  The Judge  received  oral
    evidence from the  appellant  and  his  wife,  and  his  attention  was
    directed  to  the  documentary  evidence  in  the  appellant's   bundle
    pertaining, inter alia, to the couple's financial circumstances and the
    spouse's employment with Manchester City Council  and  with  Manchester
    Car Audio and Security Limited.

 5. In his subsequent decision, Judge  Callow  recorded  at  paragraph  [6]
    that, in his closing submissions, Mr Karim of Counsel acknowledged that
    the appellant did not meet all the requirements of Appendix FM for  the
    grant of leave to remain as the spouse of a British national.  However,
    he submitted that his appeal should be allowed on the basis of a family
    life established outside the Immigration Rules which was  deserving  of
    protection.  He also acknowledged that  the  parties  had  embarked  on
    marriage when the appellant had no settled status in the UK.   However,
    he submitted that, as the appellant had given his evidence  in  English
    and public funds were not at risk, his appeal should succeed.

 6. In paragraphs [7]-[18] of his decision, Judge Callow gave  his  reasons
    for dismissing the appellant's appeal under the Rules and also  outside
    the Rules  under  Article  8  ECHR.   He  supported  his  reasoning  by
    reference to a number of authorities, including R (On  the  application
    of  Chen)  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba   -   temporary   separation   -
    proportionality) IJR [2015] 189 (IAC), Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803 and
    Bibi and Another [2013] EWCA Civ 322.





The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 7. On 9 March 2017, First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan granted the appellant
    permission to appeal for the following reasons:

        2. In short, the grounds argue that the Judge erred in  law  because
        the Judge misapplied the relevant immigration rules,  i.e.  GEN.1.2,
        and  failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  in  respect  of  financial
        requirements.

        3. At paragraph  7  of  the  decision,  the  Judge  notes  that  the
        appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  GEN.1.2   of   the
        Immigration Rules as the parties had not lived together for at least
        two years prior to the date of  application.   As  such,  the  Judge
        concluded that the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of
        GEN.1.2(iv).  However, at paragraph 5 of  his  decision,  the  Judge
        notes that following  the  Islamic  marriage  ceremony  the  parties
        underwent a registry office wedding ceremony on 6 February 2016  and
        therefore are legally married.  In light of that, it seems that  the
        appellant and  her  partner  met  the  requirements  of  GEN.1.2(i).
        Furthermore, it seems that the Judge may  not  have  given  adequate
        reasons  in  respect  of  findings   relating   to   the   financial
        circumstances.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

 8. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Mr Malik, who  did  not  appear  below,  developed  the  arguments
    advanced in the application for permission to appeal.  On behalf of the
    Secretary of State, Mr McVeety adhered to the Rule 24 response  settled
    by a colleague. The Judge was wrong  to  have  held  that  the  parties
    needed to have resided together for at least two years at the  date  of
    application.  But the error was not material, as the Judge was right to
    find that the appellant did not meet the other relevant requirements of
    the Rules, namely the financial requirement and  the  English  language
    requirement.

Discussion

 9. As the appellant was married to the sponsor,  he  was  eligible  for  a
    grant of leave to remain under Appendix FM as the partner of a  British
    national.  But the Judge's error at paragraph [7] of  his  decision  is
    not material, as the Judge rightly found that  the  appellant  did  not
    meet other relevant requirements in Appendix FM so as  to  qualify  for
    leave to remain as a partner of a British national under  Appendix  FM.
    Indeed, Counsel had not contended otherwise.

10. In oral argument before me, Mr Malik said that  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  there  was  some  documentary  evidence  to  show  that   the
    appellant's wife was earning  at  least  �18,600  per  annum.   But  he
    conceded that the appellant had not provided all the specified evidence
    required by Appendix FM-SE.  In particular,  he  had  not  provided  an
    employer's letter in respect of both his wife's jobs; and  he  had  not
    provided a run of 6-months' payslips and bank statements evidencing his
    wife's salary from either job going into her bank account,  or  into  a
    joint bank account.

11. Nonetheless, Mr Malik submitted that the Judge had erred in law  as  he
    failed to consider the exercise of  discretion  under  paragraph  D  of
    Appendix FM-SE.  Paragraph D provides, inter alia, that in deciding  an
    application in relation to which this appendix (Appendix FM-SE)  states
    that specified documents must be provided, the Entry Clearance  Officer
    or Secretary of State (the decision-maker) will consider documents that
    have been submitted  with  the  application,  and  will  only  consider
    documents submitted after the application where  sub-paragraph  (b)  or
    (c) applies.

12. I consider that Mr Malik's submission is without merit.  Firstly, there
    is no evidence that Mr Karim of Counsel, who appeared for the appellant
    below, asked the Judge to exercise discretion  under  paragraphs  D  of
    Appendix FM-SE, so as to make a finding that the financial  requirement
    was met, notwithstanding  that  much  of  the  specified  evidence  was
    missing.  Since such a case was not  put  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge, he cannot be criticised for not asking himself whether he should
    exercise discretion in the appellant's favour.

13. Secondly, the discretion arising under paragraph D of Appendix FM-SE is
    afforded to the primary decision-maker, not  to  the  Judge  hearing  a
    claimant's appeal.  Judge Callow accepted that the appellant's wife was
    probably earning more than �18,600, but he rightly declined to find  in
    the appellant's favour that the financial requirement was met,  as  the
    appellant had not produced the specified evidence to show that  it  was
    met.  The Judge had to  apply  the  Rules  and  he  applied  the  Rules
    correctly.

14. Thirdly, the discretion was not engaged even from  the  perspective  of
    the  primary  decision-maker,  as  the  appellant  had  never  made  an
    application for leave to remain as a partner.   The  application  which
    had been refused was an application for leave to remain on private life
    grounds.  It was open to the appellant to rely on his relationship with
    a British  national  by  way  of  appeal,  but  he  had  no  legitimate
    expectation of being able to succeed in his appeal  on  this  ground  -
    unless he complied in every respect with the relevant Rules.

15. The same considerations apply to the appellant's failure to provide the
    specified evidence that he met the English language requirement.  It is
    argued in the permission application that the Judge failed to take into
    account that from October 2015 the appellant required his  passport  in
    order to sit for a recognised English language test, and therefore  the
    absence of the required English language test certificate was a  matter
    which was beyond his control.  As was raised in the Rule  24  response,
    there is no evidence of the appellant seeking  to  obtain  a  certified
    copy of his passport from the Home Office  in  order  to  sit  for  any
    English language test before the hearing of  his  appeal.   The  bundle
    prepared for the hearing in the  Upper  Tribunal  includes  an  English
    language test certificate which the appellant has  obtained  since  the
    hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.  This underscores the fact that the
    point taken in the permission application is a bad one.  It was  within
    the appellant's power to sit for an English language  test  before  the
    hearing of the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal.

16. Although it is not  an  issue  upon  which  permission  to  appeal  was
    specifically granted, it is argued in the permission  application  that
    the Judge was wrong to find that there are not insurmountable obstacles
    to family life between the appellant and his partner being  carried  on
    in Pakistan; and wrong to find, in the alternative, that  it  would  be
    reasonable and proportionate for the appellant to go back  to  Pakistan
    with a view to seeking entry clearance as a spouse.  Apparently it  was
    argued before Judge Callow that neither  the  appellant  nor  his  wife
    could afford the expense which would be involved in such an enterprise.

17. No note from Counsel who appeared at  the  hearing  has  been  produced
    which substantiates the claim that  it  was  part  of  the  Appellant's
    evidence that he could not afford to return back to  Pakistan  to  seek
    entry clearance.   Furthermore,  this  claim  sits  uneasily  with  the
    parallel claim that his wife  earns  an  annual  income  in  excess  of
    �18,600, and with the fact that the appellant has family to  return  to
    in Pakistan who could presumably maintain and accommodate him while  he
    is waiting for a decision on his entry clearance application.

18. I consider that the Judge has given adequate reasons for  finding  that
    the appellant cannot bring himself within the scope of EX.1 of Appendix
    FM - and again it appears that Mr Karim  of  Counsel  did  not  contend
    otherwise - and for finding that it would not be  disproportionate  for
    the appellant to return to Pakistan to seek entry clearance.



Notice of Decision

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.


No anonymity direction is made.
