                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

HOME OFFICE APPEAL

 1. This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Chris Hodgkinson and a lay member), sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 29 January, to  on article 3 grounds an appeal by a citizen of
    Somalia, born 1  August  1979  in  Burao,  Somaliland.  Permission  was
    granted to challenge the panel's approach to the evidence about returns
    to either Mogadishu or Somaliland.  They  found  that  the  appellant's
    removal to either place "engages" article 3. This commonly  used  piece
    of refugee law jargon is taken to mean that such a  step  would  be  in
    breach of article 3, as we prefer  to  put  it.  That  means  it  would
    involve, though the panel did not spell this out, 'inhuman or degrading
    treatment' by the sending state. In each case, the panel  reached  this
    conclusion on the basis that the appellant would  face  destitution  in
    either place.

 2. The current country guidance on the first destination, also referred to
    by the panel, is in MOJ & others  (Return to Mogadishu) [2014] UKUT 442
    (IAC): as the Tribunal there made clear, the previous country  guidance
    in AMM and  others  (conflict;  humanitarian  crisis;  returnees;  FGM)
    [2011] UKUT (IAC) 445 remains in force on any points not dealt with  in
    MOJ & others. There is no direct country guidance about Somaliland; but
    Mr Jarvis's argument on  that  part  of  the  case  was  based  on  the
    potential applicability of MOJ & others, at least in part.

 3. The relevant guidance appears at paragraphs 407 - 8 of MOJ & others  as
    follows:

    "407. ...

         f.   A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence will
             look to his nuclear family, if he has one living in the  city,
             for assistance  in  re-establishing  himself  and  securing  a
             livelihood. Although a returnee may also seek assistance  from
             his clan members who are not close  relatives,  such  help  is
             only likely to be forthcoming for majority  clan  members,  as
             minority clans may have little to offer.

         g.   The significance of clan membership in Mogadishu has  changed.
             Clans now provide, potentially, social support mechanisms  and
             assistance with access to livelihoods, performing  less  of  a
             protection  function  than  previously.  There  are  no   clan
             militias in Mogadishu, no clan violence,  and  no  clan  based
             discriminatory treatment, even for minority clan members.

         h.   If it is accepted that a person facing a return  to  Mogadishu
             after a period of absence  has  no  nuclear  family  or  close
             relatives in the city to assist him in re-establishing himself
             on return, there will need to be a careful assessment  of  all
             of the circumstances. These considerations will  include,  but
             are not limited to:

             (i)    circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

             (ii)   length of absence from Mogadishu;

             (iii)  family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

             (iv)   access to financial resources;

             (v)    prospects of securing a  livelihood,  whether  that  be
                  employment or self employment;

             (vi)   availability of remittances from abroad;

             (vii)  means of support during the time spent  in  the  United
                  Kingdom;

             (viii) why his ability to fund the  journey  to  the  West  no
                  longer enables an appellant to secure financial support on
                  return.

             Put another way, it will be for the person  facing  return  to
             Mogadishu to explain why he would not be able  to  access  the
             economic  opportunities  that  have  been  produced   by   the
             "economic boom", especially as there is evidence to the effect
             that returnees are taking jobs at the  expense  of  those  who
             have never been away.

    408.     It will, therefore, only be  those  with  no  clan  or  family
         support who will not be in receipt of remittances from  abroad  and
         who have no real prospect of securing access  to  a  livelihood  on
         return who will  face  the  prospect  of  living  in  circumstances
         falling below that which is acceptable in  humanitarian  protection
         terms."

 4. There is no question of this appellant having any  close  relations  in
    Mogadishu; but Mr Jarvis's case was that what the Tribunal said in  MOJ
    & others at 407 f - g and 408 meant  that  finding  out,  if  possible,
    whether an appellant facing return there belonged to a  majority  clan,
    and if so which, was an essential part of the inquiry  facing  them  at
    407 h. Prima facie, this appellant, from Burao, might be presumed to be
    from the majority clan in that area, the Issaq. However the panel  were
    content to deal with his case at paragraph 87 on the basis that "He has
    no known family or clan associations in Mogadishu ...".

 5. There was also a 'country expert' report from Dr Anita Adam,  filed  by
    the Home Office, before the panel about conditions  in  Somaliland.  Dr
    Adam's conclusions were not challenged before the panel, as they  noted
    at 90: she took the view on the evidence that this appellant would have
    "... retained certain links to Somaliland; namely, sufficient  language
    skills to enable him to communicate [there], together  with  some  clan
    connections, and religious and cultural connections." However the panel
    went on at 91 to say this:

         "The evidence before us does not establish that he would  have  any
         financial support from his family in the United Kingdom or, indeed,
         that he would realistically have any material support from  anybody
         at all, even in Somaliland. Whilst it is one thing to indicate that
         some clan contacts are reasonably likely  still  to  exist,  it  is
         speculative to conclude precisely who those contacts might  be,  or
         whether such contacts might result in any real  assistance  to  the
         appellant."

 6. Mr Jarvis did not suggest that  the  panel  were  bound  by  Dr  Adam's
    conclusions on Somaliland, in the same way as they were by the  country
    guidance on Mogadishu in MOJ & others; but he argued that they were  at
    least significant enough for them to need to inquire more closely  than
    they did into the question of whether he might reasonably  expect  some
    clan support there, particularly as what might be presumed  to  be  his
    clan were in the  majority  in  the  area.  They  needed  at  least  to
    investigate the credibility of his claimed ignorance of his  own  clan:
    he hadn't left Somalia till he was 12, and had lived with his family in
    this country till relatively recently.

 7. We asked Mr Jarvis why his colleague who appeared for the  Home  Office
    before the panel had not cross-examined the appellant on these  points:
    he agreed it would have been  a  good  idea,  but  suggested  that  the
    importance of clan membership throughout the Somali- speaking lands was
    so well known that it amounted to an  obvious  point.  Mr  Jarvis  also
    accepted that Dr Adam had said  nothing  about  this  appellant's  clan
    membership; but she had been engaged by the Home  Office  to  read  the
    papers on this and other cases, and  to  produce  her  report  on  that
    basis.

 8. Mr Abdar argued that the  panel  had  taken  the  facts  from  previous
    decisions (as to which see Devaseelan (Second Appeals - ECHR  -  Extra-
    Territorial Effect) [2002] UKIAT 702*), as they were bound  to  do,  in
    the absence of fresh evidence, not brought to light  either  by  cross-
    examination or submissions. He  suggested  that  the  appellant's  clan
    membership  was  not  a  determinative  factor:  we  agree  with   that
    suggestion, to the extent that it could not  decide  the  case  all  by
    itself;  but  we  agree  with  Mr  Jarvis  that,   in   the   case   of
    Somalia/Somaliland, a reasoned finding on it was an essential  step  on
    the way to that decision.

 9. This appellant's first asylum appeal in 2006 had been dismissed (upheld
    on reconsideration in 2007) on the basis that, having been convicted on
    two occasions of  robbery,  and  sentenced  to  terms  of  four  years'
    detention and three years' imprisonment, he was guilty of 'particularly
    serious crime', and so excluded by legislation from the benefits of the
    Refugee Convention.

10. Mr Abdar was however quite correct in pointing out that the appellant's
    second asylum appeal had been allowed  in  2012  on  article  3  and  8
    grounds, with no appeal by the Home Office to the Upper  Tribunal.  The
    second panel also had Dr Adam's report before them, and their  findings
    on the article 3 risk they found the appellant faced in Somaliland  are
    set out in the present, third panel's decision at  paragraph  57.  They
    decided that, as an involuntary returnee without any financial or other
    assistance he  would  inevitably  end  up  in  a  camp  for  internally
    displaced persons, where there were " ...  major  protection  concerns,
    including  overcrowding,  severe  levels  of  malnourishment,  economic
    exploitation of children and a lack of physical security".

11. The guidelines in Devaseelan at paragraphs 37 - 42 are  understandably,
    since that was the situation in the individual case in  hand,  directed
    to what should be done where an appellant wishes to go behind  findings
    of fact in a previous decision. Of course, so far as possible, the same
    principles should be applied to a case where the Home Office want to do
    that. However, the  second  panel's  decision  on  article  3  risk  in
    Somaliland was also based, as the present panel pointed out at  59,  on
    the appellant's having to get there overland from Mogadishu.  That  may
    well have been the position at the time, and the panel  may  have  been
    justified, in the absence of further evidence, in taking  it  as  still
    applying.

12. However, the error of law we find on the part of the present panel  lay
    not in following the second panel's decision on the facts as they  were
    in 2012; but in failing  to  take  judicial  notice  of  the  paramount
    importance of clan membership in all the Somali  lands.  This  was  not
    only realistically acknowledged before us  by  Mr  Abdar,  but  is  now
    established as the main basis of the country guidance in MOJ,  set  out
    at 3. The outcome is that we have to  re-make  the  panel's  article  3
    decision, as well as considering the appellant's article 8 case,  which
    they did not do.

RE-HEARING

13. Evidence        The point on which we  had  set  aside  the  first-tier
    decision was soon resolved by the appellant accepting before us that he
    is indeed from the Habar Jeclo clan of the Isaaq: he said he had  never
    been asked about  his  clan  membership  before,  throughout  the  long
    history of this case. Extraordinary as we find that, we see  no  reason
    to disbelieve him on this point. The appellant's position before us, in
    a nutshell, is not that he didn't know what clan he came from,  but  in
    effect that he didn't wish to know,  having  spent  23  years  in  this
    country, where he had arrived at the age of 12, and not had anything to
    do with his own family for some time. We  shall  return  to  that  last
    point later. The other open question at  the  time  of  the  first-tier
    decision has also been resolved: returns can and do take  place  direct
    to Hargeisa, in Somaliland,  avoiding  any  need  for  overland  travel
    between Mogadishu and there.

14. It is common ground that the Isaaq are, in  Somali  terms,  a  majority
    clan: in other words, not one of the oppressed minority clans  familiar
    to those involved in immigration appeals.  Even  though  they  are  not
    necessarily in the numerical majority in Hargeisa, and do not come from
    the Mogadishu area, the position of an Isaaq returned to  either  place
    has to be seen in that light. We do not accept Mr  Jarvis's  contention
    that the guidance in MOJ & others is  applicable  to  Somaliland  as  a
    matter of law: country guidance involves questions of fact, not  to  be
    decided by such legal niceties as whether a country's division has been
    internationally recognized or not; what is more, the long title of that
    decision is specifically directed to returns to Mogadishu.  However  Mr
    Abdar did not seek to argue, either in his skeleton argument, or before
    us, that conditions in Somaliland  were  significantly  different  from
    those in Mogadishu: it is clear from the evidence  referred  to  by  Mr
    Jarvis that, if anything, they are better. Mr Abdar's case  was  rather
    that  this  appellant's  individual  circumstances  would  prevent  his
    benefiting from his membership of a majority clan in either place.

15. The reasons for this were set out in the appellant's witness statements
    (27 January 2015, prepared for the first-tier hearing; and undated, for
    us). In the first, he gives his family history: he was  born  in  1979,
    and had three sisters and four brothers. Their  father  was  killed  by
    Somali government forces during the civil war, leading the rest of them
    to take refuge in this country in 1991. His early  teenage  years  were
    troubled, and in due course he acquired a substantial criminal  record,
    set out in our appendix. By the time he was  16,  his  mother  had  had
    enough of him, for which he does not blame her now, and threw  him  out
    of the family home on his birthday.

16. For the whole of the appellant's grown-up life, he has lived in hostels
    or similar places: in 2008, some time after he had received the �38,000
    damages for unlawful detention, and had his appeal allowed by the Court
    of Appeal, his mother had strongly advised him to return with the money
    to Somaliland, where she had got in touch  with  people  to  help  him.
    However, so far as the appellant was concerned, he had lost all contact
    with Somalia or Somaliland, or with Somalis generally in this  country,
    and had no interest in going back.  In  2012  he  found  out  that  his
    younger brother Saeed had died, and,  having  promised  the  judge  who
    allowed his appeal that he would do so, tried to get back together with
    his family; but they were not interested.

17. The appellant put his  dependency  on  drink  and  drugs  down  to  the
    estrangement from his family.  He  still  had  his  mother's  telephone
    number in his head, but hadn't tried to get in touch with her. Nor  had
    he made contact with 'Baa Fin', a partnership between the Red Cross and
    the BBC Somali service, designed to help people get back in touch  with
    their families.  The reason was not only his own  feeling  of  complete
    separation from the Somali world; but his view that Somalia was still a
    failed state, to which he would not return "even for a million pounds".

18. As for the appellant's criminal record, he had taken the view that  the
    terms of the warning letters he had  been  given  left  him  safe  from
    deportation,  so  long  as  he  avoided  any  sentence  of  12  months'
    imprisonment or more, likely to lead to an automatic deportation order.
    These were not quite the terms of the 2012 letter,  carelessly  drafted
    though it was, where the events which would lead  to  deportation  were
    specified as "a custodial sentence of 12 months or  more,  or  a  total
    aggregate sentence of 12 months or more over  a  period  of  5  years".
    Clearly the first part of that is based  on  statute;  but  the  second
    represents Home Office practice.

19. The Home Office took no further action against the appellant till after
    his 2014 convictions. Following his April sentence, he  has  stayed  in
    immigration detention till the present: the appellant put this  forward
    as an illustration of his  absolute  determination  not  to  return  to
    Somalia/Somaliland.

20. Law/country guidance: article 3     The first-tier panel set  this  out
    exhaustively in their very conscientious decision, and we shall not try
    to emulate them, beyond what we see as  the  essentials.  There  is  no
    longer any issue on the primary  facts;  so  the  question  for  us  on
    article 3 is whether or not a reasonable inference is to be drawn  from
    them that the appellant would be at any real risk of  destitution  such
    as to amount to 'inhuman or degrading treatment' on  the  part  of  Her
    Majesty's Government in  returning  him,  either  to  Mogadishu  or  to
    Somaliland. On this  point  the  decision  in  MA  (Prove  Destitution)
    Jamaica CG [2005] UKIAT 00013, referred  to  in  Mr  Jarvis's  skeleton
    argument at paragraph 34, remains valid: see paragraph 14

         "Any suggestion that the Adjudicator should have concluded that the
         appellant would be destitute in the event of return to  Jamaica  is
         wholly unfounded.  Appellants seeking to make points of  that  kind
         must prove their cases and do it in a way that shows that they have
         seriously addressed their minds to returning to  their  country  of
         origin  and  have  made  proper  enquiries  about  how  they  could
         establish themselves.  If they fail to do  that  it  will  be  most
         unusual for them to be able to show that they would be destitute in
         the even to return [sic].  Such research has not been done here."

21. No such enquiries have been made in the present case either:  while  it
    might have been hard for the appellant to do so himself from detention,
    he has throughout the present proceedings had the services, not only of
    the same firm of solicitors, but of the same  very  able  advocate  and
    case manager. So we start from  the  premise  that  it  would  be  most
    unusual for this appellant  to  be  able  to  show  any  real  risk  of
    destitution on return.

22. The way in which this question has to be dealt with  for  Mogadishu  is
    laid down in MOJ & others  at paragraph 407 (h), already set out at  3:
    since this appellant has no nuclear family or close associates to  help
    him there, we can go straight to  the  individual  criteria,  which  we
    shall repeat here for easy reference. Given that the issue  on  return,
    either to Mogadishu or to Hargeisa,  is  not  on  conditions  there  in
    themselves, but on how far this appellant's lack of  recent  connexions
    with the Somali world would prevent his benefiting from the  favourable
    elements, we think those  criteria  also  provide  a  useful  means  of
    analysing any real risk on return to Hargeisa, as well as to Mogadishu.

         (i)  circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;

         (ii) length of absence from Mogadishu;

         (iii)       family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;

         (iv) access to financial resources;

         (v)  prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be employment
             or self employment;

         (vi) availability of remittances from abroad;

         (vii)       means of support during the time spent  in  the  United
             Kingdom;

         (viii)      why his ability to fund the  journey  to  the  West  no
             longer enables an appellant to  secure  financial  support  on
             return.

23. Conclusions: article 3 Referring to those guidelines:

      i) this appellant was born in Burao, and does not seem to  have  lived
         in Mogadishu at all, though presumably his mother or  someone  else
         must have gone there to collect all the visas on which he  says  he
         and his family arrived here in 1992.

     ii) He has been away for 23 years, having left when he was 12;

    iii) There are undoubtedly a significant number of Isaaq,  including  no
         doubt some Habar Jeclo, established in Mogadishu: see the  evidence
         cited in Mr Jarvis's skeleton argument at paragraph 53 b), and  his
         calculations based on it, which suggest that, at least  in  2010  -
         and there is nothing to show any likely change since -  there  were
         39,000 Isaaq families in the capital, while in Hargeisa  the  Habar
         Jeclo alone formed 5% of the population in 2012, as  shown  by  the
         USAID pie-chart in the previous paragraph. We repeat that the issue
         is not the presence or otherwise of Isaaq in these cities, but  the
         appellant's ability or willingness to  have  anything  to  do  with
         them: we shall return to this.

     iv) There is no direct evidence of the appellant's having any access to
         financial resources, since he long ago spent  the  �38,000  he  was
         awarded against the Home Office in 2006.

      v) While the appellant's means of livelihood in this country have been
         those known to Damon Runyon's characters  as  'doing  the  best  he
         can', and he had no formal education after 16, he is  by  no  means
         unintelligent, and speaks excellent English, sometimes with a  turn
         of phrase one would only expect from an educated native speaker: of
         course he has  had  plenty  of  dealings  with  such  people,  from
         probation officers to solicitors and counsel, and even quite a  few
         judges. He does not mention having had to live on the street  here,
         and we have no doubt that he is  resourceful  enough  to  fend  for
         himself,  and  enlist  whatever  support  is  available,  even   in
         Mogadishu, and still more so in Hargeisa.

     vi)  Again  there  is  no  direct  evidence  of  the  availability   of
         remittances from abroad: while the appellant's  mother  washed  her
         hands of him, when he refused to take her  advice  to  go  back  to
         Somalia with his money in 2008, Mr Jarvis suggested that she  would
         be prepared to help him there now. That was challenged by Mr  Abdar
         as speculation: while we do not think that is  quite  fair,  direct
         support from her is not an inference we are prepared to draw on the
         basis of nothing more than whatever  natural  affection  she  might
         still have for him, after seven  years  of  complete  estrangement.
         However, we have no doubt that once the appellant was back, even in
         Mogadishu and most certainly in Hargeisa, his presence would become
         known, either to the relations whose help his mother  was  prepared
         to enlist on his behalf in 2008, or to some other clan members with
         the ability to help him. There would then be no real  risk  of  his
         facing destitution in the form of 'inhuman or degrading treatment'.

    vii) See (v).

   viii) This does not apply, given the early age  at  which  the  appellant
         left Somalia.

24. Now we need to analyse more closely the reasons why this appellant says
    he cannot, or will not return to Somalia (including Somaliland).  First
    he says it is a 'failed state', where violence reigns: of  course  this
    was the position for many years, and Somalis in this country were  able
    to rely on that preventing their forced return,  no  matter  how  badly
    some of them, including this appellant, chose to behave  here.  However
    that statement is well out-of-date, even for Mogadishu, as can be  seen
    from a glance at MOJ & others ; and still more, according  to  all  the
    evidence, for Hargeisa and the rest of Somaliland. The  fact  that  the
    appellant still chooses to rely on it we think has a good deal  to  say
    about his real reasons for contesting this appeal.

25. The appellant's attitude to return to his country of  origin  might  be
    seen as perfectly understandable in someone who had lived here  quietly
    for the last 23 years, especially since the age of 12; but that is  not
    his case at all, and, if it had been so even then, he  would  no  doubt
    have become a British citizen, in line with his family members, back in
    1999. We have not forgotten that, so far as article 3 is concerned, the
    question  is  not  whether  the  appellant  deserves  to   escape   the
    consequences of his actions; but whether or not there is a real risk of
    their amounting to 'inhuman or degrading treatment'. However, we do not
    regard it as at all irrelevant to look into  his  motives  in  deciding
    whether or not that is so.

26. The piece of evidence which sheds a little more light on those  is  the
    appellant's frank admission, in discussing his later criminal record in
    his evidence in chief before us: "I thought I'd be all right,  as  long
    as I didn't get a sentence over 12 months". He managed to stay  out  of
    the criminal courts altogether from 2000, when he was given four years'
    imprisonment for robbery, till 2010, since when he has managed to  keep
    within that limit. However, his offences between then and  2014,  since
    when he has remained in detention, while by  no  means  so  serious  as
    before, have earnt him a total of more than 18 months' imprisonment  in
    all.

27. The next piece of evidence, again from the appellant  himself,  is  his
    answer to Mr Jarvis "I have totally severed all links to  Somalia:  the
    only link is to my family, and that broke down years ago". The fact  is
    that the appellant's own conduct led to that breakdown, and we  do  not
    suppose that someone in this situation  would  be  universally  popular
    with the wider Somali community in  this  country.  He  has  chosen  to
    accept that position, and to avoid reliance on any remaining links back
    home, by carefully regulating his own offending, in line with what  has
    turned out to be a mistaken understanding of the law  and  Home  Office
    practice.

28. That itself does not suggest that the appellant regards staying in this
    country as a matter of necessity, rather than choice; but,  if  he  had
    had  any  real  interest,  even  in  making  the  best  of  return   to
    Somalia/Somaliland, then we have no doubt that he would have instructed
    Mr Abdar - who would certainly have  been able to advise him as to what
    was available - to follow up some channel such as 'Baa Fin'  (see  17).
    In terms of the Tribunal's final explanation of the guidelines  at  the
    end of paragraph 407 in MOJ & others (see 3),  the  appellant  has  not
    explained why he would be unable, as opposed to unwilling, to  go  back
    and take the benefit of  the  vastly  improved  economic,  as  well  as
    security situation, in either Mogadishu or Hargeisa.

29. Bearing in mind the statistics about the proportion of Isaaq and  Habar
    Jeclo in the population of those cities (see 23 (iii)), the  reasonable
    likelihood that some form of clan support would  be  available  to  the
    appellant, once he was safely  back  there  (see  (vi)),  and  his  own
    natural resources (see (v)), we do not accept that he would be  at  any
    real risk of destitution amounting to 'inhuman or degrading  treatment'
    on return to either of them, and his article 3 appeal must fail.

30. Law: article 8  We start from the Immigration Rules, as they now stand:
    it is well settled in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ  1192  and  numerous
    following decisions that the part  dealing  with  deportation  forms  a
    complete code, only to be departed from in the case of'exceptional  and
    compelling circumstances'. Although the appellant had twice  (1996  and
    2000) received a sentence of four years' imprisonment or detention, the
    decision letter, no doubt paying due respect to  the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in 2008, did not rely on that history  itself,  but  on
    his convictions since then. Particularly in  view  of  the  appellant's
    previous history, they might well be said to  show  him,  in  terms  of
    paragraph 398, as '... a persistent offender  who  shows  a  particular
    disregard for the law', and Mr Abdar realistically did not  argue  that
    he was not liable to deportation under paragraph 398.

31. That brings into effect the final part of  paragraph  398,  which  lays
    down that, in a case of that kind '...  the  Secretary  of  State  will
    consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does not, the
    public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by other factors
    where there are very compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
    described in paragraphs 399 and 399A'. Paragraph  399  does  not  apply
    here, since the appellant has no child  or  partner  in  this  country:
    going on to 399A, there are three separate conditions, linked by 'and',
    which requires all of them to be met for that paragraph to apply.

      a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK  for  most  of  his
         life; and

      b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the UK; and

      c) there would be very significant obstacles in his  integration  into
         the country to which it is proposed he is [sic] deported.

32. The  concept  of  'social  and  cultural  integration'  bears  all  the
    hallmarks of European jurisprudence; but it was made clear by the Court
    of Appeal in JO (Uganda) and JT (Ivory Coast) [2010] EWCA Civ  10  that
    repeated periods of detention at least militate against  it.  We  shall
    now go on to consider the effect of these provisions.

33. Article 8: conclusions Dealing with the conditions in paragraph 399A,

      a) the appellant has indeed been lawfully resident in this country for
         most of his life, though under threat of deportation  for  much  of
         it;

      b) we do not consider him 'socially and culturally integrated' in this
         country: quite apart from the sentences of over nine years in  all,
         of  which  he  has  served  the  custodial  period,  together  with
         immigration detention since that came to an end, he has no  current
         links with his own family, and there is no evidence of  his  having
         any particular attachments or activities  elsewhere:  he  has  been
         living in hostels, with no work record;

      c)  we  have  dealt  with  the  question  of  his   integration   into
         Somalia/Somaliland at 23 - 29, and, for the  reasons  given  there,
         see no 'very significant obstacles' to it, at least in  the  longer
         term, to which such a concept seems to be directed.

34. It follows that, unless the appellant can  show  the  'very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those  described  in  paragraphs  399  and
    399A' required by 398, he cannot be entitled to leave to  remain  under
    article 8: clearly that provision in the Rules replicates, if  possible
    with even more force, the requirement  for 'exceptional and  compelling
    circumstances' set out in MF (Nigeria). We do not think there  are  any
    in this case: though we can understand the  appellant's  reluctance  to
    leave the country where he has spent his last 23 years to return to the
    scene of his first 12, he is the author of his own misfortune, and must
    bear that consequence.
