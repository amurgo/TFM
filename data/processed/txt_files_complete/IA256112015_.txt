                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The parties are as above, but the rest of this determination refers  to
    them as they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  J  C
    Grant-Hutchison, promulgated on 17 May 2016, allowing  the  appellant's
    appeal under article 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The SSHD's grounds recognise this as a sensitive and sympathetic  case,
    and then run essentially as follows.  The Judge  improperly  approached
    the case as if it were a review of the decision  of  FtT  Judge  Blair,
    promulgated on 10 July 2015, IA/07639/2015, allowing an appeal  by  the
    appellant's husband.  That decision was no more than a starting  point.
    The appellant provided no new evidence,  which  was  significant.   The
    absence of medical evidence for her showed there had been some  change.
    Four years had gone by since she was bereaved of her infant child.  The
    FtT made no finding on the public interest in  maintaining  immigration
    control.

 4. The appellant filed a response to the grant of  permission.   Its  main
    points are these.  The Judge took the previous decision as  a  starting
    point, as parties agreed she should do, and went  on  to  consider  the
    case on its current merits, having heard evidence.   She  did  not  say
    there was "no new evidence", as suggested  in  the  grounds,  but  that
    there was "no new evidence which disturbed the earlier findings".   The
    public interest was acknowledged at �13 - 14 and at �28 where the Judge
    made a balanced assessment of proportionality.

    Submissions for SSHD.

 5. The appellant was granted leave outwith the rules to cover a period  of
    bereavement and grieving, which the judge erroneously extended  into  a
    period which had no end date. Tragic though the circumstances were, the
    period for which leave was justified was finite.

 6. The judge in effect proceeded as if she  were  reviewing  the  previous
    decision, rather than undertaking a fresh fact-finding exercise.   That
    decision was about her husband remaining with her while she  had  leave
    on an exceptional basis.  It was not  directly  on  her  circumstances.
    The judge failed  to  come  to  conclusions  based  on  the  up-to-date
    position. The decision effectively made the two cases into a  perpetual
    loop, by which the leave of one spouse  expired,  and  leave  was  then
    obtained, based on still current leave of the other.

 7. The decision was driven entirely by sympathy.  It did not take  account
    of the evident recovery process. The appellant was able  to  engage  in
    employment and study. She needed no medical intervention.

 8. The judge did not engage with whether this was a case of private or  of
    family life. The burial of a child in the UK was not a basis on which a
    right to remain based on family  life,  outside  the  rules,  could  be
    constructed.  The judge did not engage with the  fact  that  a  private
    life claim based on precarious status was highly  unlikely  to  succeed
    outside the rules.  The  appellant  and  her  husband  had  suffered  a
    devastating bereavement, but there was no evidence that there would  be
    any disproportionate impact on them if they were required to leave  the
    UK to carry on their private and family life in Nigeria.

 9. The judge did not take account of the public interest. The statement at
    paragraph 20 that exhumation  could  not  possibly  be  in  the  public
    interest was a misconception of how that concept applied to the case.

10. The decision should be set aside.

11. The appellant had tendered additional evidence,  for  consideration  if
    the decision required to be remade.  Mrs  O'Brien  submitted  that  the
    further evidence was in keeping with a couple who had recovered as  far
    as possible and as might be expected from their loss, and were  getting
    on with their lives. Discretionary leave having  been  granted  on  the
    basis that it would cover the treatment of the child and  the  recovery
    of the parent, there was nothing to show that  there  was  any  further
    right to leave outside the rules.

12. The outcome should be reversed.

    Submissions for Mrs E I O

13. Judge Grant-Hutchison had not taken the decision of Judge Blair as  any
    more than starting point. She had not thought her task  was  to  review
    that decision. She  received  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  from
    husband, and based her decision on that.

14. It was accepted that the appellant's  claim  to  leave  to  remain  was
    entirely based on the burial of her son  in  the  UK,  and  had  always
    fallen outside the  immigration  rules.  There  was  a  deep  emotional
    connection to the country where her son had been born and been buried.

15. The sequence of events was that the appellant was lawfully  here  as  a
    student. She was granted  leave  based  on  her  infant  son's  medical
    condition, but unfortunately the grant did not arrive  until  after  he
    had passed away. Her husband sought a  visit  visa  over  that  period,
    which was initially refused, but then granted on a further application.
    He arrived only after the child died.  He  was  refused  further  leave
    outside the rules, but his appeal was allowed by Judge Blair so that he
    might remain with his wife. The family had never sought  to  circumvent
    the rules. At present, the appellant has leave continuing under section
    3C, and her husband has leave granted in pursuance  of  his  successful
    appeal.

16. The grounds were misleading in saying that the decision  was  based  on
    there being no new evidence; it was based on all  the  evidence  up-to-
    date, which led the judge to a similar conclusion.

17. Current evidence showed that the appellant  and  her  husband  had  the
    ability to cope, but that was strongly linked with  being  where  their
    son lived, and being able to visit his place of  burial.  Residence  in
    the UK in the long term had not been their plan, but became so by force
    of circumstances beyond their control. Any further leave which would be
    granted in pursuance of the favourable decision would normally  be  for
    the period of 2 � years, and the  circumstances  would  require  to  be
    revisited thereafter.

18. The judge had not quoted at length but had referred to part 5A  of  the
    2002 Act (paragraphs 26 - 27), and it was plain that the appellant  and
    her husband were self-sufficient, both in employment, and both able  to
    speak English. They had not sought public funds even  in  the  form  of
    legal aid in respect of their immigration proceedings.

19. There was no significance in whether this was a private and family life
    case. There was a connection to the UK of an exceptional and compelling
    nature, such that removal would be disproportionate. No public interest
    could be discerned in enforcing her removal.

20. If the decision were to be remade, the  up-to-date  circumstances  were
    these.  The appellant is expecting another child.  She has an offer  of
    a place on a nursing course, but  cannot  take  it  up  unless  granted
    further leave by the respondent; her 3C leave is not accepted for those
    purposes.  She and her  husband  could  not  visit  the  child's  grave
    regularly, if at all, if they had to return to Nigeria.

21. There was no error of law requiring  the  decision  to  be  set  aside.
    Alternatively, if the decision were to be remade then based on all  the
    circumstances to which reference had been made, the outcome  should  be
    in favour of the appellant.

    Reply for SSHD.

22. It was evident from the submissions that the appellant and her  husband
    now assert a right to remain indefinitely in the UK, based on  loss  of
    their child. The circumstances of the case were highly sympathetic,  as
    had  been  acknowledged,  but   did   not   disclose   anything   which
    exceptionally  gave  them  such  a  right,  outside  the   rules.   The
    circumstances did not come close to the requirements of the  rules  for
    entitlement to be placed on a route to settlement.

23. It was not correct that leave following upon the decision under  appeal
    would automatically be for 2 � years, its term was  a  matter  for  the
    Secretary of State.

24. It was difficult to see how the case could be analysed as one involving
    family life, and if it were one involving private life, then the  judge
    plainly failed to take account of the section  117B,  particularly  the
    legally precarious nature of the appellant's immigration status.

    Further response for Mrs E I O

25. I permitted Miss Weir to reply to the  above.  She  accepted  that  the
    length of any period of leave would be for the respondent. At  the  end
    of that, it would be for the appellant to make a  further  application.
    That was for the future. This was not a matter which disclosed error in
    the decision currently under consideration.


    Discussion and conclusions

26. The judge said in her  concluding  paragraph  that  the  appellant  was
    "still going through the healing process which can only  be  individual
    to her in how she can come to terms with her son's death and  the  time
    it may take.  To take that away from her now would not in  my  view  be
    proportionate".

27. That was the judge's assessment at the date of the hearing before  her.
    The grounds and submissions do not show that she fell into  the  errors
    of treating Judge Blair's' decision as determinative, or as the subject
    of a review rather than the starting point in a distinct  case,  or  of
    failing to consider current circumstances.

28. The first sentence of paragraph 20 of  the  judge's  decision  reads  a
    little oddly, as if the respondent had  to  show  that  exhumation  and
    reinternment would be in the public interest. There was no such onus on
    the respondent, and no reason to think that such a procedure might ever
    be in the public interest.  The matter arises by reference  to  another
    case, the report of which was produced for the appellant,  but  neither
    party appears to have suggested that the possibility of exhumation  and
    reinternment was relevant in this case.  That matter does not appear in
    the respondent's decision, which says that it would be  reasonable  for
    the appellant and her husband to return to Nigeria "and  you  can  then
    apply for entry clearance should you wish to return to the UK to attend
    the service  every  year".   (A  service  of  remembrance  is  arranged
    annually by the hospital where  the  child  was  cared  for  and  by  a
    church.)  No relevant submission by either  party  at  the  hearing  is
    recorded in the decision.

29. That part of the  decision  may  be  disregarded,  without  making  any
    difference to the outcome.

30. Apart from that, the respondent has not shown that the  judge  was  not
    aware that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in  the
    public interest - s.117B(1) of the 2002 Act.  The point is  fundamental
    to all article 8 cases, and she is a highly experienced judge.

31. It often does not matter, as Miss Weir submitted,  whether  a  case  is
    analysed as disclosing family or private life; but it does matter where
    s. 117B (5) applies - "Little weight is to be given to a  private  life
    established by a person at a time when the person's immigration  status
    is precarious".  The appellant's status was always lawful  but  it  was
    precarious, applying the case law on that term.  That was  perhaps  the
    strongest point made in the respondent's submissions; but it  does  not
    appear to have been made to the FtT, and is  scarcely  foreshadowed  in
    the grounds.

32. The grounds are not established.  The rest of the submissions  for  the
    SSHD in my view were relevant to a fresh decision on the merits, rather
    than to error by the FtT on the case then before it.

33. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

34. The anonymity direction made by the FtT is preserved.  Unless and until
    a tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is  granted
    anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly
    identify her or any member of her family.  This direction applies  both
    to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
