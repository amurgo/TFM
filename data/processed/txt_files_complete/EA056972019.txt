This decision follows a remote hearing in respect of which  there  has  been
no objection by the parties. The form of remote hearing was by  video  (V),
the platform was Microsoft Teams. A face  to  face  hearing  was  not  held
because it was not practicable and all  issues  could  be  determined  in  a
remote hearing.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Kelly (the judge) who, in a  decision  promulgated  on  20
         January 2021, dismissed the appellant's appeal against the decision
         of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  ("the  respondent")  dated   23
         September 2019 refusing to issue him an EEA Family Permit  pursuant
         to the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  ("the
         2016 Regulations").

Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 27 December  1985.
         Sometime in 2019 he made an application for an  EEA  Family  Permit
         based on his relationship with Ms  Asmat  Mushtaq  ("sponsor"),  an
         Italian national resident in the United Kingdom and exercising free
         movement  rights  under   the   'Citizens   Directive'   (Directive
         2004/38/EC). The appellant claimed that the sponsor was his  sister
         and that  he  was  financially  dependent  upon  her  to  meet  his
         essential needs.

      3. The  respondent  refused  to  issue  the  EEA  Family  Permit.  The
         respondent was not satisfied that the  appellant  and  the  sponsor
         were related as claimed. The respondent was not therefore satisfied
         that the appellant was an extended family member as  understood  in
         reg 8 of the 2016 Regulations. Nor  was  the  respondent  satisfied
         that the appellant was financially dependent on  his  sponsor.  The
         respondent additionally noted that the sponsor had  a  husband  and
         "at least four dependent children." She worked 22 hours a week  and
         had a net income of approximately �775 a month. She  also  received
         state benefits of �1100-�1400 per month. As the state benefits were
         means tested the respondent was  not  satisfied  that  the  sponsor
         would be able to financially support the appellant and  her  family
         once he entered the UK and there was therefore a risk that  he  may
         become a burden on the public funds system. The appellant  appealed
         the respondent's decision to the First-tier Tribunal.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      4. The judge considered a number of documents prepared by both parties
         for the hearing. These included a witness statement by the sponsor,
         copies of the appellant's birth certificate and family registration
         certificate, money transfer orders, wage  slips,  Universal  Credit
         Statements and bank statements relating to the sponsor, a report on
         the available accommodation for the sponsor's home, and a  list  of
         the income and expenditure of the sponsor's household  in  the  UK.
         The respondent was not represented at the hearing. The judge  heard
         oral evidence from the sponsor via an Urdu interpreter.

      5. In his decision the judge was  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was
         related to the sponsor as  claimed,  and  that  the  appellant  was
         financially dependent upon the sponsor for his essential needs.  No
         challenge has been raised by the respondent against these findings.

      6. The judge nevertheless  dismissed  the  appeal.  His  reasoning  is
         contained at [18] of his decision.

             "However, the ability of the appellant to fulfil the threshold
             criteria for extended family membership  does  not  of  itself
             entitle him to a right of free movement if the  respondent  is
             able to justify denial of entry (Article  3  of  the  Citizens
             Rights Directive 2004/38/EEC, implemented by regulation 12 (5)
             of the 2016  Regulations,  above).  The  respondent  justifies
             refusal on the ground that there is a risk  of  the  appellant
             becoming a burden upon public funds.  This  appears  to  be  a
             legitimate justification in principle given that the  preamble
             to the Citizens Rights Directive specifically qualifies rights
             of free movement by reference to a beneficiary  not  becoming,
             "an unreasonable burden on the social assistance system of the
             host member [sic] Member State". Both the appellant's skeleton
             argument and the sponsor's witness statement seeks to  address
             this issue by drawing attention to the evidence  of  available
             earned income from members  of  the  sponsor's  household  for
             which  means-tested  benefits  merely  provide  a  supplement.
             Nevertheless, as an adult exercising a right of  residence  in
             the United Kingdom recognised by the grant of  an  EEA  family
             permit, the appellant would  be  entitled  to  receive  social
             assistance benefits in his own right. There is moreover a real
             risk,  indeed  likelihood,  that  he   would   exercise   that
             entitlement indefinitely. He is aged 35 years and  unemployed.
             There was no evidence to suggest that he has ever been in paid
             employment  or  that  he  has   any   particular   skills   or
             qualifications. Moreover, it is not suggested that  permitting
             the appellant to join the sponsor in the  United  Kingdom  has
             any relevance to the sponsor's decision to  exercise  her  own
             right to free movement by residing in the United Kingdom  (the
             underlying purpose of  allowing  non-EU  family  members  free
             movement within its territory). I am therefore satisfied  that
             the  respondent  is  justified  in  refusing  the  appellant's
             application to enter as an extended family member of a  person
             exercising  European  Union  Treaty  rights  in   the   United
             Kingdom."

The challenge to the judge's decision and the 'error of law' hearing

      7. The appeal grounds contend that the judge was not entitled, on  the
         evidence before him, to conclude that the appellant would  possibly
         become reliant on public funds. There was no  evidence  before  the
         judge that the appellant would in fact be entitled to any benefits.
         Nor was the judge entitled to find that there was a "real risk"  or
         "likelihood" that the appellant would exercise any such entitlement
         indefinitely, particularly in  light  of  the  judge's  credibility
         findings and the evidence from the sponsor that she  would  provide
         the appellant with all his essential needs when he enters  the  UK.
         The judge's conclusions  relating  to  the  appellant's  employment
         history and his lack of  skills  and  qualifications  were  reached
         without any  questions  asked  of  the  sponsor  relating  to  said
         employment history and skills and qualifications. This amounted  to
         a procedural impropriety. Had the sponsor been asked such questions
         she  would  have  provided  evidence   concerning   the   sponsor's
         qualifications up to Secondary School Intermediate  level  and  his
         previous employment history.

      8. In granting permission to appeal Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Page found it arguable that, if  the  sponsor  was  not  asked  any
         questions concerning the appellant's employment history and  skills
         and qualifications, and if these issues  were  not  raised  at  the
         hearing, the judge's findings at [18] may not be sustainable.

      9. At the outset of the 'error of  law'  hearing  I  raised  with  the
         representatives my concern as to the legal basis  for  the  judge's
         assessment at [18]. I indicated to  the  parties  my  concern  that
         Article 3 of the Citizens Directive and reg  12  (5)  of  the  2016
         Regulations required a refusal to issue an EEA Family Permit to  an
         extended family member to be accompanied by reasons justifying  the
         refusal, but did not indicate that such  an  application  could  be
         refused on the basis that an applicant may become  an  unreasonable
         burden on the social assistance system of the  host  Member  State,
         and that the preamble of the Citizens Directive (which  could  only
         be preamble (16))  noted  by  the  judge  was  concerned  with  the
         expulsion of beneficiaries from a host Member State who  became  an
         unreasonable burden on the social assistance system, not  with  the
         issuance of a Family Permit.

     10. Ms Everett indicated that she had never seen a decision refusing to
         issue a Family Permit based on the possibility or  even  likelihood
         that an applicant would become an unreasonable burden on  the  UK's
         social  assistance  system,  and  that  she  had   researched   the
         transitional provisions relating to the U.K.'s withdrawal from  the
         EU but could not find any reference to any legal basis  that  could
         support such a decision.  Mr  Ahmed  had  also  conducted  his  own
         research and was  unable  to  find  any  legislative  provision  or
         judicial decision entitling the respondent to  refuse  to  issue  a
         Family Permit  on  the  basis  that  an  applicant  may  become  an
         unreasonable burden on the U.K.'s social  assistance  system.  Both
         representatives expressed their agreement that the  judge  was  not
         lawfully entitled to dismiss the appeal for the reasons advanced at
         [18].

Discussion

     11. As accepted by Ms Everett, the respondent was not lawfully entitled
         to refuse to issue a Family Permit on the basis that the  appellant
         may, in the future, become  an  unreasonable  burden  on  the  UK's
         social assistance system. There was simply  no  legislative  basis,
         either in the Citizen's Directive or in the 2016 Regulations, which
         implements the Citizen's Directive, empowering  the  respondent  to
         refuse an application on this basis. There  is  nothing  in  either
         Article 3 of the Citizens Directive or  reg  12  (5)  of  the  2016
         Regulations that would entitle the respondent to refuse to issue  a
         Family Permit because an applicant may become  entitled  to  social
         assistance or because the  applicant  may  become  an  unreasonable
         burden on the social assistance system. The  extensive  examination
         of  the  personal  circumstances  of  an  applicant  that  must  be
         undertaken is framed in both the Directive and the 2016 Regulations
         by reference to the relationship between the applicant and  the  EU
         national and whether the applicant is or was a  member  of  the  EU
         national's household or is or was dependent on the EU national. The
         requirement to give reasons justifying the  refusal  to  issue  the
         Family Permit must be understood in this context and  by  reference
         to the same framework.

     12. The judge referred to the preamble to the  Citizens  Directive  and
         stated that this qualified rights of free movement by reference  to
         a beneficiary not becoming "an unreasonable burden" on  the  social
         assistance system of the  host  Member  State.  The  only  relevant
         preamble is preamble (16). This reads:

             'As long as the beneficiaries of the right of residence do not
             become an unreasonable burden on the social assistance  system
             of  the  host  Member  State  they  should  not  be  expelled.
             Therefore, an expulsion measure should not  be  the  automatic
             consequence of recourse to the social assistance  system.  The
             host Member State should examine  whether  it  is  a  case  of
             temporary difficulties and take into account the  duration  of
             residence, the personal circumstances and the  amount  of  aid
             granted in order  to  consider  whether  the  beneficiary  has
             become an unreasonable burden on its social assistance  system
             and to  proceed  to  his  expulsion.  In  no  case  should  an
             expulsion measure be adopted  against  workers,  self-employed
             persons or job-seekers as defined by the Court of Justice save
             on grounds of public policy or public security.'

     13.  It  is  clear  that  this  preamble  relates  to  expulsion  of  a
         beneficiary (in the present case, an extended family member) who is
         already residing in the UK. It does not relate in  any  way  to  an
         application by someone not in a Member State for a Family Permit.

     14. It follows that the respondent was not lawfully entitled to  refuse
         to issue the Family Permit on this particular basis, and  that  the
         judge consequently erred on a point of law in dismissing the appeal
         on this basis. This error is clearly material.

     15. Both parties agreed that it was appropriate for me to set the First-
         tier Tribunal's decision aside and remake the decision  myself.  Ms
         Everett agreed that there had been  no  challenge  to  the  judge's
         primary findings of fact  that  the  appellant  was  the  sponsor's
         brother and therefore an  extended  family  member,  and  that  the
         appellant was dependent on the sponsor to meet his essential needs.
         In  these  circumstances  I  am  satisfied  that  the  requirements
         necessary for a grant of a Family Permit are met. I therefore allow
         the appeal.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the making  of  an  error  on  a
point of law requiring it to be set aside.

I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal.
