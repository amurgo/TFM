Representation:

For the Appellant:     The Sponsor in person
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are husband and wife aged 75  and  70  respectively  and
    citizens of India.  They  made  applications  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer for leave to enter the UK as the adult dependent  relatives  of
    their son, a British citizen. The Entry Clearance Officer  refused  the
    applications and the Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appeals came before Judge Callender Smith at Taylor House  on  10th
    September 2013 and in a determination  promulgated  on  17th  September
    2013 the Judge allowed the appeals under the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer has been granted permission  to  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal. The  grounds  upon  which  permission  was  granted
    accept the Appellants' need for long-term  care  but  assert  that  the
    Judge did not adequately assess  the  possibility  that  such  care  is
    available in India. The Judge's findings that the suggestion that  care
    could be provided in India "ignores the familial and cultural bonds and
    expectations that exist in this situation" ignores the requirements  of
    E-ECDR2 .5.

 4. The application was made on 19th July 2012 and so fell  to  be  decided
    under Appendix FM. The relevant requirements are contained in section E-
    ECDR of Appendix FM. The  particular  part  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer suggests the Judge  did  not  deal  with  is  E-ECDR.2.5  which
    requires:-

         "The applicant or, if the  applicant  and  their  partner  are  the
         Sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must be
         unable, even with the practical and financial help of the  Sponsor,
         to obtain the required level of care in the country where they  are
         living, because-

          a)  it is not available and that is no person in that country  you
             can reasonably provide it; or

          b) it is not affordable".

 5. The Judge set out that he had considered all of  the  evidence  in  the
    Appellants' bundle and heard oral evidence  from  the  Sponsor.  It  is
    correct that nowhere in the determination does the Judge  consider  the
    availability and affordability of care in India and in particular  does
    not consider that requirement of the Rule. At best he suggests that the
    Rule does not conform with culture.  He is not  entitled  to  ignore  a
    requirement of the Immigration Rules, even if he disagrees with it.

 6. In allowing the appeal under the Rules without specifically considering
    one of the requirements of that Rule the  First-tier  Tribunal  made  a
    material error of law. I therefore  set  aside  the  determination  and
    redecide the appeal.  There is no necessity for evidence - it is  fully
    set out in the previous determination.

 7. This is a sad case in that the Sponsor and his family reside in the  UK
    and his parents who are now elderly and in poor health  and  reside  in
    India. In  particular  his  father  is  terminally  ill  with  advanced
    prostate cancer that has spread to his bones and his mother is also  in
    a fragile state of health. However, the Appellants in this  case  quite
    simply cannot meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules.  They  have  sold
    property in India which has provided them with a cash sum  of  �200,000
    and they live in their own property. �200,000 is a very large amount of
    money in India. There is no suggestion that help cannot be purchased in
    India to care for them and quite clearly the finances are available.

 8. It is understandable that the  Sponsor,  being  their  son,  wishes  to
    provide care for them himself. However, if they cannot meet  the  Rules
    for entry to the UK then he would have to undertake that care in  India
    rather than the UK. The circumstances in this case are the  unfortunate
    result of younger members  of  the  family  relocating  and  resettling
    across continents. They do so without any legitimate  expectation  that
    as their parents become elderly they will be able to join them  in  the
    UK. They can if they meet the Rules; they cannot if they do not.

 9. Accordingly, for the above reasons the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  is
    allowed such that the Appellants original  appeals  against  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decisions are dismissed.
