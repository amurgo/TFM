                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against a decision  of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Clemes)  allowing  the  respondents'
    appeals against refusals  to  grant  them  entry  clearance  under  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395) as a  partner  (the  first  respondent)  and
    children  (the  remaining  five  respondents)  to  join   the   sponsor
    (respectively the husband and father  of  the  respondents)  who  is  a
    British citizen living in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

 2. Judge Clemes  allowed  the  appeals  of  the  first,  fifth  and  sixth
    respondents under the Immigration Rules and he allowed the  appeals  of
    the second, third and fourth respondents under Art 8.

 3. Before the judge, the crucial issue in respect of all six  applications
    for entry clearance was whether the individuals  could  establish  that
    they met the financial requirements in E-ECP3.1 of Appendix FM (for the
    first respondent  as  a  partner)  and  E-ECC2.1  (in  respect  of  the
    remaining respondents as children).

 4. It was accepted before the judge that if all  six  appellants  were  to
    succeed under the requirements of Appendix FM  then  the  sponsor  must
    establish, by the specified evidence set out in Appendix FM-SE, a self-
    employed income of �32,000.  In fact, the sponsor relied upon financial
    documents in respect of two restaurants that he ran: in respect of  the
    "Sicilian Pizza" through documentation he demonstrated that he  had  an
    income for that business for the required twelve months of �18,776; and
    for the "Tuck-In Caf�" he demonstrated a  profit  for  the  five  month
    period that business had been operative of �8,339.  Even if, therefore,
    the sponsor's income from both businesses was taken  into  account  and
    accumulated, it only demonstrated an income of �27,115 which  was  just
    under �5,000 short of  what,  it  was  accepted,  he  was  required  to
    establish under Appendix FM.

 5. As a consequence, Ms Harrington who represented the respondents  before
    the judge, invited the judge to allow the appeals of only three of  the
    respondents under the Immigration Rules on the basis that  the  �27,115
    was sufficient for them to succeed.  Ms Harrington  told  us  that,  on
    instructions from the sponsor, she abandoned the appeals of the second,
    third and fourth respondents under the Rules.  She invited the judge to
    allow the appeals of the first respondent (the sponsor's  partner)  and
    the fifth and sixth respondents (the sponsor's two  youngest  children)
    under the Rules and to allow the  appeals  of  the  second,  third  and
    fourth respondents under Art 8.

 6.  Judge  Clemes  acceded  to  that  invitation.   At  para  9   of   his
    determination Judge Clemes said this:

         "9.  ... The rules are  very  much  a  blunt  instrument  and  have
             replaced a more subjective test of 'adequate means'.  In cases
             where a means test is imposed, there will be a 'cut off' point
             and some applicants will fall  inside  and  some  outside  the
             limits.  The respondent had  not  looked  at  the  Appellants'
             cases in the correct way and  -  I  find  -  had  decided  the
             applications in effect as one, applying  the  limit  and  then
             deciding that all of the applications must be rejected as they
             were regarded as inextricably linked together.  I  agree  with
             the submission on behalf of the Appellants that it  is  unfair
             and disproportionate for the Respondent to tacitly acknowledge
             that the Sponsor's income will be over the threshold when  the
             Appellants next come to apply but then to say that  they  must
             go through the entire process again even though (based on  the
             objective approach of the arithmetical calculation)  three  of
             them should have been already granted entry clearance.   There
             is nothing in the Rules to have stopped  the  Respondent  from
             taking this approach".

 7. Then, at para 11, Judge Clemes reached the following conclusion:

         "11. I find that the decision of the Respondent wrongly applied the
             Rules in  the  Appellants'  application  for  entry  clearance
             whether the group was taken as a whole or individually.  It is
             disproportionate to expect them to re-apply as a  group  in  a
             matter of months even though there is an expectation that they
             would then succeed.  I agree with the  submission  by  Counsel
             for the Appellants that the proper approach was to look at the
             Appellants one by one.  This will mean that 3 of them (the 1st
             Appellant  and  -  for  these  purposes  -  the   2   youngest
             Appellants) succeed under the Rules (Appendix FM E-ECP3.1  for
             the  1st  Appellant  and  E-ECC  3.3  for  the  5th  and   6th
             Appellants)".

 8. In respect of the second, third and fourth  respondents,  Judge  Clemes
    concluded that the refusal of entry clearance to these respondents  was
    a breach of Art 8.  He said this at para 13:

         "13. ... If the Respondent had made the  decision  correctly,  then
             that would have afforded entry clearance to the 1st  Appellant
             and the others that I have identified above.  This would  mean
             that  half  of  the  family  will  have  succeeded  in   their
             application  and  the  others  not.   Although  there   is   a
             legitimate public end to be achieved (economic well-being),  I
             do not accept that in this  case  the  splitting  up  of  this
             family (whether that means some of the children coming to  the
             UK without their mother or the mother coming here with some of
             the children) is a proportionate response and yet that is  the
             response that the Rules give us.  Alternatively  the  solution
             proposed by the  Respondent  is  that  the  entire  family  go
             through  the  whole  process   again   with   the   reasonable
             expectation that they will succeed.  Setting aside the cost of
             that path, I  do  not  accept  that  it  can  be  regarded  as
             proportionate as it causes further  delay  on  an  application
             which should have been (at least) partially acceded to in  the
             first place.  The proportionate response would  have  been  to
             look at the 6 Appellants cases both as one unit and then on  a
             case by case basis to ensure that their joint interests  as  a
             family and their separate rights as individuals were  regarded
             and met.  I do not find that the Respondent took that approach
             here".

 9.  Accordingly,  Judge  Clemes  allowed  the  second,  third  and  fourth
    respondents under Art 8 of the ECHR.



The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

10. The ECO sought permission to appeal Judge Clemes' decision  essentially
    on three grounds.  First, the judge had wrongly applied Appendix  FM-SE
    in taking into account the five months' profit from the "Tuck-in  Caf�"
    of �8,339 in the five months of the relevant financial year.  Para 7 of
    Appendix FM-SE required the  evidence  to  relate  to  the  "last  full
    financial year" which, it was argued, meant  the  entire  twelve  month
    period of that  financial  year  and  not  only  five  months  of  that
    financial year.  Secondly, it was argued that the judge had been  wrong
    to consider that any of the respondents met the financial  requirements
    of Appendix FM.  Their applications were to be seen in combination  and
    none could succeed under  the  Rules  unless  the  required  income  of
    �32,000 was established.  Thirdly, in allowing the  second,  third  and
    fourth respondents' appeals under Art 8, the judge had wrongly  applied
    Art 8.

11. On 1 April 2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Levin) granted the  ECO
    permission to appeal on those grounds.

12. Thus, the appeal came before us.

Discussion

     The claims under the Rules

13. We begin with the relevant provisions of Appendix FM dealing  with  the
    eligibility  for  entry  clearance  as  a  "partner"  and   a   "child"
    respectively in s.E-ECP and E-ECC.

14. As regards a partner (the first respondent), E-ECP3.1 states that:

         "The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from  the  sources
         listed in paragraph E-ECP3.2 of -

         (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least -

              (i) �18,600;

              (ii)     an additional �3,800 for the first child; and

              (iii)    an additional �2,400 for each additional child; ..."

15. There is also provision for taking  account  of  savings  but  for  the
    purposes of these appeals, the income figures alone are relevant.

16. As regards "child" the meaning of  that  is  set  out  in  E-ECP3.1  as
    follows:

         "In this paragraph 'child' means a dependent child of the applicant
         who is -

             (a)  under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of 18
                  years when they were first granted entry  clearance  under
                  this route;

             (b)  applying for  entry  clearance  as  a  dependant  of  the
                  applicant, or has limited leave to enter or remain in  the
                  UK;

             (c)  not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and

             (d)  not an EEA national with a right to be admitted under the
                  Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006".

17. Consequently, a partner (such as the first respondent) must establish a
    gross annual income by the  specified  documentation  of  �18,600  plus
    �3,800 for  the  "first  child"  and  an  additional  �2,400  for  each
    "additional child".  Taking into account all the respondent's  children
    the mathematics led to the figure being, as is accepted, �32,000.  This
    requirement is, of course, only applicable to the "applicant" which is,
    of course, the "partner".  There is no  doubt  that  by  virtue  of  E-
    ECP3.1(c) each of the five respondents who are the  first  respondent's
    children is  a  "child"  for  the  purposes  of  E-ECP3.1(a).   In  our
    judgment, there is no other way of understanding what  is  meant  by  a
    "dependent child of the applicant" who is applying for entry  clearance
    "as a dependent of the applicant".  Where an application is made either
    jointly or, as was the case in the instant appeals, individually by all
    six applicants but with each  application  identifying  the  family  as
    travelling to the UK as a unit, each of the children is  properly  seen
    as a "dependent child of the applicant", namely  their  mother  who  is
    seeking to apply as a "partner" under Appendix FM.

18. It did not assist the first  respondent  that  Ms  Harrington  withdrew
    reliance on the Rules in relation to three of  the  child  respondents.
    They had applied for entry clearance as dependants of their mother  and
    they continued to apply for entry clearance as  her  dependents  albeit
    relying only on Art 8.   They  each  still  counted,  therefore,  as  a
    "child" for the purposes of the financial  rules  applicable  to  their
    mother.  It might  well  have  been  different  if  Ms  Harrington  had
    withdrawn their claims for entry clearance altogether on the basis that
    her  instructions  were  they  should  be  allowed  to  remain  in  the
    Philippines without their mother and siblings.  But that was  not  what
    happened nor, we would venture to suggest, would that be an appropriate
    action to take in order to allow some of  the  respondents  to  succeed
    under the Rules.

19. There is another reason why the withdrawal of  the  three  respondents'
    reliance on the Rules was not relevant to Judge Clemes' decision.  This
    was an entry clearance case and, as a result, by virtue of s.85A(2)  of
    the NIA Act  2002  the  judge  was  required  to:  "consider  only  the
    circumstances appertaining at the time of the decision". At the time of
    the decision, each of the child respondents was seeking entry clearance
    under the Immigration Rules.  The change in circumstances, as a  result
    of Ms Harrington's abandonment of  three  of  the  respondents'  claims
    under the Rules, was not a circumstance which appertained at  the  time
    of the ECO's decision.  The judge was, as a  consequence,  required  to
    consider whether each of the respondents' appeals could  succeed  under
    the Immigration Rules on the basis that, as at the  time  of  decision,
    they were seeking to rely upon the Immigration Rules as  conferring  an
    entitlement to entry clearance.

20. In our judgment, it  follows,  therefore,  that  the  first  respondent
    simply could not succeed under  Appendix  FM  without  establishing  an
    income of �32,000 which she could not do even if all of  the  sponsor's
    income from his two businesses disclosed in the relevant  documentation
    was taken into account.

21. Where, then,  does  that  leave  the  remaining  respondents?   In  our
    judgment, their  applications  also  could  not  succeed  although  the
    application  of  the  Rules  to  each  of  their  applications  is  not
    unproblematic.  As the ECO decided in each of their cases,  they  could
    not succeed under E-ECC.  The financial requirement for a "child" in E-
    ECC2.1 reflects, with one  crucial  distinction,  that  which  we  have
    already set out in relation to a partner under  E-ECP3.1.   Again,  the
    applicant, by means of the specified  documents,  must  show  that  the
    sponsor has a gross annual income of at least  �18,600,  an  additional
    �3,800 for the first child and an additional �2,400 for each additional
    child.  The definition  of  "child",  however,  in  E-ECC2.1  does  not
    exactly reflect that in the partner provision in E-ECP3.1.  Instead, it
    provides that:

         "In this paragraph  'child'  means  the  applicant  and  any  other
         dependent child of the applicant's parent who is -

             (a)  under the age of 18 years, or who was under the age of 18
                  years when they were first granted entry under this route;

             (b)  in the UK;

             (c)  not a British Citizen or settled in the UK; and

             (d)  not an EEA national with a right  to  remain  in  the  UK
                  under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006".

22. The difference is  that  the  "dependent  child"  of  the  "applicant's
    parent" (namely the first respondent) must be "in the UK".  The wording
    is set in the present tense  and,  therefore,  it  appears  to  exclude
    consideration of any "dependent children" of the particular applicant's
    parent who are outside the UK for example, as  in  this  case,  seeking
    entry clearance.

23. However, that said, even if the children are  not  considered  together
    for each application, each child in respect of its own application  (if
    Ms Harrington is correct that  each  must  individually  be  considered
    under the Rules and the financial requirements)  must  show  their  own
    �18,600 discrete from the �18,600 which any other child  seeking  entry
    clearance in respect of  its  application  must  establish.   In  other
    words, cumulatively the five child respondents  would  be  required  to
    show �18,600 x 5 = �93,000.  Were it otherwise, any number of  children
    would be able to meet the financial requirements simply by pointing  to
    the same �18,600 earned by their sponsor in the UK.

24. We conclude this is clearly what the Rules require even if this results
    in some rather curious features.  Why  the  �18,600  is  taken  as  the
    starting point for the child's application is not easy to discern  when
    it is the principal figure required for a "couple".  Likewise, to  then
    add in figures only for other "dependent" children of their parent only
    if they are already in the UK, omits consideration  of  those  who  are
    seeking to come to the UK at the same time.

25. It is clear to us that Parliament's intention was  to  see  the  family
    seeking to come to the UK as a unit.  That is directly reflected in the
    "partner" financial requirements.  In  a  case  where  an  accompanying
    child's application is being considered, and where the parent satisfies
    the financial requirements,  that  in  effect  means  the  accompanying
    children are shown to have access to the  requisite  financial  support
    from the sponsor.  There is no need for them to show further  financial
    support and yet the Rules require that they do.  They must  demonstrate
    the 'couple' sum of �18,600 for each of  them  when  the  Parliamentary
    intention must have been  that,  depending  on  whether  they  are  the
    "first" or "additional" children to accompany their parent,  they  only
    need show individually �3,800 or �2,400.  That, in our judgment, is the
    amount Parliament  intended  as  representing  the  minimum  needed  to
    eliminate or, at least, reduce the need for reliance on  public  funds.
    Yet, the child rules are, on the face of it, worded otherwise.

26. It seems to us that the sensible interpretation of  the  "partner"  and
    "child" provisions relating  to  financial  requirements  would  be  to
    recognise that family applications of the kind seen  in  these  appeals
    are, in effect but not form,  joint  applications  where  one  or  more
    children are seeking to accompany a parent to the  UK.   The  financial
    requirement in E-ECP3.1 directly reflects that requiring consideration,
    at least, in respect of the partner's application  of  a  gross  annual
    income because he or she is joining a partner in the UK and,  if  being
    accompanied by one or more  children,  specifying  additional  sums  to
    reflect Parliament's view as to the minimum level of income required to
    avoid a reliance upon public funds.

27. In this case, as we have already  noted,  that  means  that  the  first
    respondent had to establish an income of  �32,000.   Without  that  she
    simply could not succeed under the Rules.  Further, none of  the  other
    respondents as her "dependent" children could succeed on the Rules.  We
    have no doubt that it was wrong for the Judge to view the  applications
    as individual ones.

28. In any event, as a result of s.85A of the 2002 Act, in considering  the
    children's claims it was equally wrong for the Judge  to  consider  the
    circumstances other than they were appertaining  at  the  date  of  the
    ECO's  decision:  all  the  respondents  were  at  that   time   making
    applications for  entry  clearance  under  the  Rules.   Ms  Harrington
    accepted that if all respondents have to be taken  into  account,  none
    can succeed.

29. Therefore, the first respondent's appeal could not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules and, for the reasons we have given, neither could any
    of the other respondents.  We  are  clear  that  that  is  the  correct
    outcome of  these  appeals  and  the  respondents  have  never  had  an
    entitlement to entry clearance under the Rules.  The ECO was correct to
    refuse each of the respondents' applications for entry clearance  under
    the Rules.  It follows that Judge Clemes erred in law in  allowing  the
    appeals under the Immigration Rules  of  the  first,  fifth  and  sixth
    respondents.  Applying the Rules each of those appeals,  together  with
    those of the third, fourth and fifth respondents under the  Immigration
    Rules, fell to be dismissed.

30. In reaching that conclusion in respect of the Rules, we do not need  to
    decide whether the judge was  wrong  to  take  into  account  the  five
    months' income in the relevant financial year earned by the sponsor  in
    respect of the "Tuck-in Caf�".   The respondents  cannot  succeed  even
    taking into account that income.  The total does not meet the financial
    requirements in Appendix FM.

    Article 8

31. Turning now to Judge Clemes' decision  to  allow  the  appeals  of  the
    second, third and fourth  respondents  under  Art  8,  those  decisions
    clearly cannot stand as they were premised on the first respondent  and
    the fifth and sixth respondent having entry clearance to come to the UK
    and,  in  fact,  potentially  leaving  the  remaining  respondents   in
    Afghanistan.  That, of course, is no longer  the  position  given  that
    none of the respondents can succeed under the Rules.

32. That then leaves all the respondents in Afghanistan  unless  and  until
    they are able to meet the financial requirement in Appendix FM.  As  we
    understood it, that is a very real prospect in the  future  given  that
    the sponsor's second business  will  have  traded  for  a  considerably
    longer period than the five months upon which he could  rely  in  these
    applications.

33. Ms Harrington did not address us on whether  the  respondents'  appeals
    should be allowed under Art 8 if we were to dismiss the  appeals  under
    the  Rules.   Even  accepting  that  family  life  exists  between  the
    respondents and the sponsor in the UK, we see no basis  upon  which  it
    can be said that the refusal of entry clearance is  a  disproportionate
    interference with their family life.  The UK is entitled,  through  the
    Immigration Rules, to set appropriate financial requirements for  entry
    to the UK to reflect the public interest in individuals not becoming  a
    burden on  the  public  funds  and  the  UK  taxpayer.   The  financial
    requirements in Appendix FM have been upheld as lawful by the Court  of
    Appeal in R (MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985; [2014] Imm AR 6.
     We were shown no solid evidence of any impact upon the respondents  if
    there is delay in them making a successful entry clearance  application
    at a time when the sponsor's income is such as to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules.  We do not consider it to be a matter of any
    great weight, if indeed a matter entitled to any weight  at  all,  that
    further applications for entry clearance will involve  the  payment  of
    further fees.  That is not a matter which, in our  judgment,  bears  on
    the issue of the impact of  the  refusal  of  entry  clearance  on  the
    respondents' private and family life protected by Art 8.

34. We have regard to the relevant factors set out in s.117B of the NIA Act
    2002.  The maintenance of  effective  immigration  control  is  in  the
    public  interest  including  the  need  to   meet   minimum   financial
    requirements.  We were not told whether any of  the  respondents  spoke
    English but, even if they do, s.117B(2) does not entitle entry  to  the
    UK or add positively to their claim (see AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT
    260 (IAC) and Forman (ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 412 (IAC)).
     Likewise, it is in  the  public  interest  that  the  respondents  are
    "financially independent" but, as  we  have  already  noted,  they  are
    unable to meet the financial requirements of the Rules and  we  do  not
    consider that the public interest reflected in that fact is in any  way
    dissipated in  these  appeals  simply  because  the  sponsor  has  some
    resources.

35.  Having  regard  to  all  these  circumstances,  in  our  judgment  the
    respondents  have  failed  to  establish  that  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance to them breached their rights under Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

36. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow  the
    appeals of the first, fifth and sixth respondents under the Immigration
    Rules involved the making of an error of law.  Those decisions are  set
    aside.

37. Further, the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the  appeals
    of the second, third and fourth respondents under Art  8  involved  the
    making of an error of law and those decisions are also set aside.

38. We remake the decisions and dismiss each of  the  respondents'  appeals
    under the Immigration Rules and also under Art 8 of the ECHR.

                                                                      Signed



                                                                     A Grubb
