For the Appellant:              Mr P Nath, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondent/Claimant:    Mr J Chipperfield, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals from  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal allowing on Article 8 grounds the  claimant's  appeal  against
    the decision by the Secretary of State to refuse to vary his  leave  to
    remain, and to make directions for his removal from the United  Kingdom
    by way of directions under Section 47 of the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality  Act  2006.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that  such  a  direction  is
    warranted for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The claimant is a national of Guyana, whose date of birth is  15  April
    1979.  On 14 October 2011 he applied for ILR outside the Rules.  He had
    begun a relationship with Ms Saffire at City  &  Islington  College  in
    2007 where he was a student, and she was a lecturer.   Ms  Saffire  was
    South African by nationality, and was in the UK on a work permit basis.
     Ms Saffire had never been to Guyana, and he had never  been  to  South
    Africa.  All of their friends and ties were in the UK, and they  wished
    to settle here with their son Jayden, who had been  born  on  4  August
    2011 from their relationship.  At the present time, Ms Saffire did  not
    have settled status in the UK, but she was eligible for ILR and she was
    in the process of making an application.

 3. The application was refused on 28 January 2014.  It was  accepted  that
    he had been lawfully resident in the UK since 9 January  2005  when  he
    was given leave to enter as a working holidaymaker.  His last grant  of
    leave to remain had been as a  Tier  2  Migrant,  and  this  leave  had
    expired on 16 October 2011.  The fact that he had resided in the UK for
    a period of almost nine years, and the fact that he  had  family  here,
    was not reason enough to grant him ILR outside the Rules.

 4. His application was considered under Appendix FM. His  son  was  not  a
    British citizen and had not lived in the UK continuously for  at  least
    seven years.  There were no insurmountable obstacles to his family life
    with his son and partner continuing outside the UK.  Although  his  son
    was born in the UK, as he was only 2 years old he was considered  young
    enough to be able to adapt to life abroad with his parents.  While  the
    material quality of life in Guyana might not be to the same standard as
    it would be in the United Kingdom, this does not give rise to any right
    to remain in the UK.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Majid sitting at  Taylor  House
    in the First-tier Tribunal on  1  October  2014.   Mr  Chipperfield  of
    Counsel appeared on behalf of the  claimant,  and  the  respondent  was
    represented by a Presenting Officer.

 6. In his subsequent determination, the judge  allowed  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 ECHR, essentially for the reasons which he gave in  paragraph
    10.  The claimant had been in the country lawfully for over nine years.
     The claimant was in a relationship which was subsisting, and he had  a
    child from the relationship  who  should  not  be  uprooted  from  this
    country.  The claimant had developed ties in the UK and to  remove  him
    from this country would bring an unreasonable disruption to  his  life,
    and the lives of his partner and child. His partner had confirmed  that
    she was pregnant with another child due in January 2015.  They lived in
    a flat with two bedrooms and a reception room and she was earning about
    ï¿½45,000 per annum.  There was no danger of the claimant and his  family
    becoming a burden on public funds.  The claimant had told him  that  he
    had been a victim of a miscarriage of justice, and the Court of  Appeal
    had quashed his conviction.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 7. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal,  arguing  that
    the judge materially erred in three main  respects.   Firstly,  he  had
    referred to evidence from the claimant that his  child  was  a  British
    national.  Such evidence was in conflict with what was  stated  in  the
    refusal letter, and the judge had failed to  resolve  the  question  of
    whether the child was a British national or  not.  The  status  of  the
    child, whilst not a determinative factor, would clearly impact  on  the
    overall proportionality assessment.

 8. The second ground of challenge was that the judge failed to have regard
    to relevant case law and Article  8,  and  to  the  submission  of  the
    Secretary of State in the refusal letter and  at  the  hearing  to  the
    effect that it was in the best interests of the child to be  with  both
    parents, and  that  this  could  be  realised  in  either  Guyana,  the
    claimant's country of origin, or in South Africa, his partner's country
    of origin.  There was nothing to suggest the family would be unable  to
    establish themselves in either country,  albeit  with  some  degree  of
    hardship.  The child in the instance appeal was not a British  citizen:
    it was in his best interests to be with his parents; and he could  hold
    no future right to remain in this country.   The  family  life  of  the
    claimant and his family members could be continued in all its essential
    elements outside the UK, and it was not unreasonable to require this to
    happen.

 9. Thirdly, the judge had failed to address the provisions of Part  5A  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (i.e. Section 117).

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

10. On 24 November 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge White granted  permission
    to appeal as it was arguable that  the  judge  had  given  insufficient
    reasons as to why any of the Immigration Rules were met; the judge  had
    failed to make a reasoned finding  regarding  the  nationality  of  the
    claimant's child which in turn had led the judge to fail to address  in
    proper fashion the issue of Article 8 and where the best  interests  of
    the child lay; and the judge arguably  appeared  to  show  no  adequate
    engagement with Part 5A of the 2002 Act ("public interest").

The Appeal Hearing

11. At the hearing  of  the  appeal,  Mr  Chipperfield  conceded  that  the
    decision was legally flawed.  It had not been the claimant's case  that
    his son was a British national.  The judge had also  not  engaged  with
    his submission that Appendix FM did not apply, as the  application  had
    been made before the introduction of the new Rules.







Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

12. I find that an error of law is made out for the reasons  given  in  the
    application for permission to appeal and in  the  subsequent  grant  of
    permission.   I  do  not  consider  that  any  further  elaboration  is
    required.

13. On the topic of how this decision should  be  remade,  Mr  Chipperfield
    tentatively submitted that this might have been an appropriate case for
    remittal to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  reconsideration,  for  two
    reasons: firstly because the claimant had now accrued ten years' lawful
    residence,  and  secondly  because  there  was  an  argument  that  the
    Secretary of State had not undertaken a  proper  consideration  of  the
    child's welfare in the refusal letter, as she was required to do  under
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act. However, he accepted that this  was  not  a
    point which he had taken before Judge Majid, and given the child's  age
    and status at the date of decision, I consider it  is  doubtful  merit.
    The appellant's alleged accrual of ten years' lawful residence (and the
    fact that his partner and child now both have ILR)  is  potentially  of
    greater significance. But in all the circumstances I consider that  the
    appropriate course is for the appeal to be remitted to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a de novo hearing.  In the  interim  it  is  open  to  the
    claimant's legal representatives to invite the Secretary  of  State  to
    reconsider her decision in the light of the current  state  of  affairs
    and/or for the appellant to apply for leave to remain as the partner of
    a person present and settled here.

Decision

14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained an error of law  such
    that the decision should be set aside and remade.

Directions

15. There will be a further hearing to remake the decision  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House before any judge apart from Judge  Majid.
    None of the findings of fact made by Judge Majid shall be preserved.


Anonymity


The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
