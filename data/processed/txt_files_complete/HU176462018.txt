For the Appellants:    Mr Khalid, Counsel Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal born in  1982.  She  appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Murray) to dismiss her appeal on human rights  grounds.  Permission  to
    appeal to this tribunal was granted on the 3  May  2019  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Gumsley.

 2. On 4 May 2018 the Appellant applied for entry clearance  to  settle  in
    the UK as the adult dependent relative  of  her  father,  an  ex-Gurkha
    soldier who migrated to the UK on 2 August 2016. The Appellant  asserts
    that she has family life with her father and four siblings  in  the  UK
    because she always lived with her family until they left Nepal and  she
    remains financially and emotionally dependent on her  father.  Although
    she  cannot  satisfy  all  of  the  requirements  of  Annex  K  of  the
    immigration rules, it would be disproportionate  to  refuse  her  entry
    because of the historical injustice towards ex Gurkha soldiers and  the
    lack of any other countervailing factors.

 3. The application was refused on 26 July 2018. The Appellant  was  unable
    to meet paragraph 9 (4) of Annex K because she was aged over 30 at  the
    date of the application. She also could not meet  paragraph  9  (5)  of
    Annex K because she  was  not  wholly  financially  and/or  emotionally
    dependent on her sponsor. It was said that the fact that the  Appellant
    does not meet the immigration rules outweighs  the  historic  injustice
    referred to in R (on the application of Sharmilla Gurung and Others)  v
    SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8. The  Respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant has family life with her parents. The Respondent decided that
    it was not a disproportionate breach of Article 8 ECHR  to  refuse  the
    Appellant entry to the UK.

 4. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal ('FtT'), it  having
    been accepted that  the  Appellant  was  over  30  when  she  made  her
    application and could not meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  K,  the
    primary issue was whether family life existed between the Appellant and
    the sponsor at the date the sponsor left the  UK  and  whether  it  had
    endured since then. This entailed an analysis of whether the  Appellant
    was financially and emotionally dependent on her sponsor.

 5. The FtT did not accept that the Appellant  had  family  life  with  her
    father when he left Nepal in 2016 nor that family life had  endured  so
    as to engage Article 8(1) ECHR. The following reasons  were  given  for
    that conclusion:

              i) The Appellant had provided no supporting evidence that  she
                 was living with her parents  and  siblings  as  part  of  a
                 family unit when her father and siblings relocated  to  the
                 UK in August 2016 despite being over 35 years  old  at  the
                 date of the application;

             ii) Had the Appellant enjoyed family life with her parents  and
                 siblings when they made their application, it was  unlikely
                 that  she  would  have  waited  two  years  to   make   the
                 application after  they  left  for  the  UK  in  2016.  The
                 sponsor's explanation that the delay was to do with lack of
                 finances was not evidenced;

            iii) There was no supporting evidence as to where the  Appellant
                 currently lives and whether she lives alone or with others.



    The Grounds of Challenge

 6. The Appellant submits that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  is
    flawed in the following material respects:

              i) Misdirection in law. In particular:

                 Having found that the Appellant continues to be financially
                 dependent on the sponsor and that she has been  in  regular
                 contact with him since 2016, the FtT failed  to  apply  the
                 relevant authorities on family life  in  general  including
                 Kugathas [2013] EWCA Civ 31   and  specifically  failed  to
                 apply the guidance on family life in Gurkha cases including
                 R (on the application of Sharmilla  Gurung  and  Others)  v
                 SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8 and Ghising (family  life  -  adults
                 -Gurkha\Policy) Nepal [2012] UKUT 00160.

             ii) Failure to consider material facts/evidence. In particular:

                 The Tribunal erred in its assessment of family life between
                 the Appellant and the sponsor. They were living together in
                 one household as a joint family. The Appellant  provided  a
                 large number of documents to demonstrate her financial  and
                 emotional dependency on the sponsor including  hundreds  of
                 pages of phone contacts, money remittances, evidence of the
                 sponsor's pension being used by the  appellant  to  support
                 herself and evidence of a visit to Nepal.

    The Respondent's Defence

 7. By his Rule 24 response dated the 12th July 2019 the Secretary of State
    submits that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  contains  no
    material error of law and that it should be upheld.  It  is  said  that
    neither the statement of the Appellant nor  of  the  father  gives  any
    indication where the Appellant lives and the father does not state that
    she lives alone. On the basis of this  'vague  evidence'  the  FtT  was
    entitled to draw the conclusions in relation  to  the  lack  of  family
    life.   As  far  as  the  adequate  reasoning/irrationality  point   is
    concerned, it is contended that the FtT had the benefit of hearing  the
    evidence of the sponsor and drew conclusions that family life  did  not
    exist at the date of departure and has not been maintained since  2016.
    The FtT gave reasons for drawing these conclusions and they  were  open
    to  the  FtT  on  the  evidence  provided.  The  FtT  directed   itself
    appropriately.

    Concession

 8. At the outset of the hearing Mr Melvin accepted that had the FtT  found
    that family life existed between the Appellant and  the  sponsor,  that
    the appeal would have fallen to be  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds
    pursuant to Article 8 ECHR because of the significance of the  historic
    injustice in the proportionality assessment.   This  accords  with  the
    findings and direction of the First-tier Tribunal, and  we  accept,  in
    light of the authorities, that it is a concession properly made.

    Discussion and Findings

    Ground (i):  Misdirection in law

 9. The FtT found at [15] on the basis of the extensive evidence before her
    that 'the Appellant may receive her father's pension (page 32) and that
    he has been transferring money to her. The Western Union money receipts
    from page 53 to 59  show the Nepalese calendar. The sender's  documents
    at pages 60 to 70 show payments of around �100 in May and July 2017 and
    in March, June, September and  November  2018  and  �200  in  total  in
    January and February 2019'. At [16] the FtT accepted that the  evidence
    showed 'financial support in the form of remittances in the  region  of
    �50 per month since May 2017'.

10. At [15] the FtT found that there was regular communication between  the
    Appellant and sponsor. 'At pages 74 and 75 are call records from  Nepal
    Telecom that show the Appellant ringing her father's  number  regularly
    between November 2018 and February 2019. There are further  phone/viber
    communications print outs from page  74  to  2018  which  show  regular
    contact from October 2016'. It is accepted at [16] that 'there has been
    regular contact since 2016'.

11. The FtT also accepts that the Appellant is single at  [15].  'There  is
    also confirmation at page 16 that the Appellant is unmarried  from  the
    Diktel Rupakot Majhuwaadhi Municiplaity'.  It was  also  accepted  that
    since coming to the UK in 2016 the sponsor has  returned  to  Nepal  to
    visit his daughter in 2018.

12. Mr Melvin's position is that these findings are insufficient  on  their
    own to lead to a conclusion that the ties between the sponsor  and  the
    Appellant amount to more than the normal emotional ties  between  adult
    family members in accordance with Kugathas (supra).  He  suggests  that
    the FtT's inference, which is not explicitly stated in the decision, is
    that the Appellant is in fact living with a sibling in Nepal.

13. It is submitted by Mr Khalid, that having found the adult Appellant  to
    be both financially dependent on her father the sponsor and in  regular
    contact with him three of four times  a  day,  the  FtT  was  bound  to
    conclude if  directed  properly  to  the  relevant  caselaw,  that  the
    relationship between the Appellant and the sponsor  amounts  to  family
    life in accordance with Article 8 (1) ECHR.

14. We are in agreement with Mr Khalid. We are  satisfied  that  since  the
    Tribunal found that the Appellant was both financially and  emotionally
    dependent on the sponsor in the UK, that a properly directed FtT  would
    have concluded that  the  relationship  between  the  sponsor  and  the
    Appellant amounted to more than the normal bonds of  affection  between
    adult relatives particularly in the context of Nepalese  culture  where
    it is the norm for single children to remain  as  dependents  of  their
    parents until they are married. In this respect we note the proposition
    accepted in Ghissing (supra) that young adults who have not yet founded
    families of their own could be considered to  enjoy  family  life  with
    parents and other close family members. We are satisfied that  the  FtT
    misdirected itself in law and that this is a material  error.   On  the
    facts as found by the FtT, this is a family life within the meaning  of
    Article 8.

    Ground (ii): Failure to consider material facts/ evidence

15. The Appellant's position is secondly that the FtT failed to  take  into
    account the evidence before it in relation to where the  Appellant  was
    living at the time her father and siblings left Nepal, the evidence  of
    where she currently lives and the explanation as to why the sponsor did
    not apply for the Appellant to join him sooner.

16. The Appellant gave evidence in  her  witness  statement  that  she  had
    always lived with her parents until they left  Nepal  and  the  sponsor
    gave consistent evidence in his witness statement to  this  effect.  In
    his oral evidence the sponsor stated that the appellant 'is alone since
    I came here'. This evidence was not challenged by the Respondent at the
    hearing.  Nor was it asserted  in  submissions  that  the  sponsor  was
    lacking in credibility; Ms Rawlings for the Respondent  rather  focused
    on the length of time that the family members had been apart from  each
    other. It was not submitted that the sponsor was untruthful.  In  these
    circumstances it is not apparent  to  us  why  the  FtT  rejected  this
    consistent  evidence  particularly  when  the  FtT  accepted  that  the
    Appellant is unmarried and the  FtT  has  experience  as  a  specialist
    Tribunal in dealing with Gurkha family reunion cases.

17. The sponsor gave an explanation in his oral evidence that  he  did  not
    apply for the Appellant to come to the UK sooner because  of  financial
    limitations. He stated that 'I did  not  have  enough  money  to  bring
    them'. The FtT found that there was no supporting financial evidence to
    support this assertion, however this reason for rejecting the existence
    of family life was not raised in the original decision and the 76-year-
    old sponsor gave oral evidence that he was in receipt of Pension Credit
    and Housing Benefit. The sponsor's oral evidence in  this  respect  was
    not challenged. It was not put to him that he was not telling the truth
    about this delay.

18. We are satisfied that the FtT gave inadequate reasons for rejecting the
    evidence that the sponsor had Appellant had always lived together  (the
    Appellant's mother died in 2000), were living together at the time that
    the sponsor departed for the UK and that the delay in applying for  the
    Appellant to join the sponsor was due to financial constraints. This is
    also a material error  of  law.  By  failing  to  assess  the  evidence
    adequately the FtT  made  erroneous  findings  of  fact  which  led  to
    negative findings in respect of family life.

19. We indicated at the end of the hearing that we were satisfied that  the
    grounds of appeal were made out  and  that  the  decision  of  the  FtT
    contained a material error of law in relation to the findings on family
    life for the reasons set out above.

20. We go onto remake the decision. We are satisfied,  given  the  evidence
    before the FtT, that the Appellant lived as a dependent of  her  father
    in a household with her father and siblings until they left for the  UK
    in 2016 and that at the point of  their  departure  she  was  a  single
    unemployed Nepalese female who had not set up an independent household.
     We find, notwithstanding the Appellant's age, that Article 8  (1)  was
    engaged in respect  of  family  life  at  the  date  of  the  sponsor's
    departure. We are also  satisfied,  given  the  longstanding  financial
    support as well as the visit of the sponsor that  family  life  between
    the Appellant and the sponsor has endured since their departure.

21. Given Mr Melvin's concession at the outset of the appeal, we find  that
    in circumstances such as this, where a Gurkha  can  show  but  for  the
    historic injustice, he would have settled in the UK at a time when  his
    dependent (now) adult child would have been able to accompany him as  a
    dependent minor child that was a strong reason for holding that  it  is
    disproportionate to permit the adult child to join the family  now.  In
    this appeal in the absence of any other countervailing factors over and
    above the  public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration  control  the
    outcome of the proportionality assessment is in the Appellant's favour.

    Decisions

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.

23. The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
