                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                    NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT UNDER RULE 17A

 1.  The  appellant  brought  an  appeal  under  section  82  (1)  of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002  Act")  against
    the decision of the respondent made on 22 May 2014 to remove  him  from
    the United Kingdom. The appeal was allowed pursuant to  paragraph  EX.1
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules but  dismiss  on  human  rights
    grounds.  The Secretary of State appealed with permission to the  Upper
    Tribunal against that decision but that  appeal  was  dismissed  on  29
    December 2014. The appellant was  also  granted  permission  to  appeal
    against the decision to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds.

 2. The two appeals in the Upper Tribunal thereby created  were  not  heard
    together, and on 29 December 2014, the Secretary of State's appeal  was
    dismissed by the Upper Tribunal and on 16 February 2015, the  Secretary
    of State granted the appellant 30 months' leave to remain.

 3. Although section  104  of  the   2002  Act  has  been  amended  by  the
    Immigration Act 2014 with effect from 20 October 2014 by  operation  of
    The Immigration  Act  (Commencement  No.  3,  Transitional  and  Saving
    Provisions) Order 2014 ("the Order"), section 104 of the  2002  Act  is
    one of the "saved provisions" as defined in article 1 (e) of that order
    and so by operation of article 9 of the Order, continues to have effect
    as the respondent is not a person who falls within either article 10 or
    11 of the Order.

 4. I am therefore satisfied that as the appellant has been granted  leave,
    the appeal is to be treated as abandoned pursuant to section 104 (4) of
    the 2002 Act and that the Upper Tribunal must therefore issue a  notice
    pursuant to rule 17 A (2) informing the  parties  that  the  appeal  is
    being treated as abandoned. This is a Notice pursuant to rule  17A  (2)
    to inform the parties that the appellant's case is deemed abandoned.

 5. The effect of the appellant's case being deemed abandoned is  that  the
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at an end.
