For the respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer.


                           Decision and Directions


 1. By an Order dated 14 November 2016, the Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the
    appellants' appeals to the Court of Appeal against a decision of Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Doyle by which he dismissed their appeals  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellants had been granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Metzer
    by which he dismissed their appeals against decisions of the respondent
    of 5 September 2014 refusing their Article 8 claims. Judge Doyle  found
    that Judge Metzer had  materially  erred  in  law  and  set  aside  his
    decision. Judge  Doyle  proceeded  to  re-make  the  decisions  on  the
    appellants' appeals. He dismissed their appeals.

 3. The Statement of Reasons attached to the Order of the Court  of  Appeal
    states that the parties agreed that the Upper  Tribunal  had  erred  by
    failing to consider the third appellant who was under 18 years  of  age
    at the date  of  her  application,  under  para  276ADE(1)(iv)  of  the
    Immigration Rules. The parties also considered that the Tribunal  would
    benefit from considering the  applications  of  the  third  and  fourth
    appellants in light of the recent  judgment  in  MA  (Pakistan)  &  Ors
    [2016] EWCA Civ 705.

 4. Given the terms of the Order of the Court of Appeal,  the  decision  of
    Judge Doyle cannot stand. This must include his decision to  set  aside
    the decision of Judge Metzer. At the hearing  before  me,  Mr  Whitwell
    confirmed that he did not seek to persuade me that Judge Metzer had not
    materially  erred  in  law.  I  am  satisfied  that  Judge  Metzer  did
    materially err in law for the reasons given by  Judge  Doyle,  which  I
    adopt; see, in particular, para 13 of his decision.  I  set  aside  the
    decision of Judge Metzer.

 5. When setting aside a decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the  Upper
    Tribunal will be able to re-make the relevant decision  itself  in  the
    majority of cases.  However, the Practice Statement for the Immigration
    and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal recognises at para 7.2 that it
    may not be possible for the Upper Tribunal to proceed  to  re-make  the
    decision when it is satisfied that:

         "(a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal."

 6. In my judgment, this case falls  within  para  7.(b).  I  am  therefore
    satisfied that a remittal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  the  right
    course of action.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Metzer  involved  the
making of an error on a point of law such that it falls to be set aside.

These appeals are remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  the  decision  to
be re-made on the merits on all issues by a judge other than Judges  of  the
First-tier Tribunal Metzer and Doyle.
