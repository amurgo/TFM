Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr McTaggart, Counsel instructed by McLernon Moynagh
For the Respondent:    Mr Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Portugal born on 1st January  1981.   The
    appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 29th  September  2011.   She
    was arrested on arrival having been found to  be  in  possession  of  a
    quantity of concealed drugs.  She was convicted of  drugs  offences  on
    23rd November 2012 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment in excess of
    three years.  Part of that sentence, one year  and  seven  months,  was
    imprisonment with a further one year  eight  months  on  licence.   The
    drugs were cocaine and diamorphine.  The appellant became  involved  in
    drug smuggling due to  her  limited  financial  situation  and  took  a
    calculated and deliberate risk.

2.   By reason of the conduct of the appellant the respondent was  satisfied
    that the appellant would  pose  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the interests of public policy/public security if she
    were allowed to remain in the United Kingdom.  Accordingly  a  decision
    was made to make a deportation order under Regulation 19(3)(b)  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006, the  order  made
    in accordance with Regulation 24(3) of the EEA Regulations.

3.   The appellant sought to appeal  against  that  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox and Mr Charles O'Brian  (non-
    legal member) on 23rd April 2014.

4.   The Tribunal upheld the concerns of the respondent  and  dismissed  the
    appeal under the EEA Regulations and also under Article 8 of the ECHR.

5.   The appellant seeks to appeal  against  that  decision,  contending  in
    particular that the Tribunal did not consider fully the aspect of  risk
    to the community and also failed to properly consider the interests  of
    K, her child.

6.   Permission to appeal was granted in respect of the  assessment  of  the
    child's best interests.  Thus the matter comes before me  in  pursuance
    of the grant of leave.

7.   Mr McTaggart, on behalf of the  appellant,  relies  upon  the  detailed
    grounds of appeal.

8.   At the outset of the appeal I sought to clarify with  the  parties  the
    essential issues at large.

9.   It seems to me that those issues are firstly  whether  or  not  at  the
    time of the decision the Tribunal were properly entitled to come to the
    conclusion that the appellant posed a genuine, present and sufficiently
    serious threat to the interests of public policy/public security if she
    were allowed to remain in the United Kingdom and that  her  deportation
    is justified under Regulation 21.  The  second  issue  related  to  her
    child K and whether it was reasonable in the circumstances to expect  K
    to accompany her mother in a return to Portugal.  The third  issue  was
    whether if that were not the case adequate consideration had been given
    to the welfare of K.

10.  It was also said in the submissions of Mr McTaggart, in the grounds  of
    appeal, that the Tribunal had been unduly  critical  of  the  appellant
    such as to donate a  degree  of  bias  towards  her.   In  that  latter
    capacity it was said that it was unfair of the Tribunal to  comment  in
    paragraph 6 of the determination that the appellant  claimed  that  her
    crimes were not "that serious".  It was contended that at no stage  did
    the appellant or her Counsel assert that fact.

11.  Mr Shilliday, on behalf of the respondent, invited me to  find,  having
    regard to paragraph 3 of the appellant's skeleton argument, that  there
    was certainly an  attempt  in  that  paragraph  to  indicate  that  the
    appellant was operating at the lowest level of the drugs trade,  acting
    at best out of desperation and at worst exploitation.  He invited me to
    find that there was an attempt to downplay the serious  nature  of  the
    offence and that the comments by the Tribunal were open to be made.

12.  He seeks to contrast that comment with the sentencing  remarks  of  the
    Judge as set out in Annex B to the respondent's documents that she  was
    carrying a substantial amount of heroin in her body to a value of  some
    �25,600 to �45,000.  The Judge indicated that had it not been  for  the
    fact that she fell to be sentenced with a Mr D she would have  received
    a higher sentence as the sentence of three years and three  months  was
    imposed.

13.  As to the risk presented by the appellant it is to be noted  that  this
    offence was the appellant's first introduction to Northern Ireland.  It
    was noted from the probation report that the appellant  was  struggling
    to maintain employment and  meet  her  basic  needs  and  that  of  her
    daughter whilst living in Portugal.  Despite reported efforts to attain
    regular work she suggests her financial  situation  was  very  limited.
    Thus it was that she accepted the suggestion of being a mule for  cash.
    It was suggested that the financial reward would have assisted  her  to
    "get established" in Northern Ireland and to provide a good quality  of
    life for herself and her daughter.

14.  At paragraph 9 of the determination the  Tribunal  indicate  that  they
    have paid particular attention to the Judge's sentencing remarks.   The
    Tribunal noted that upon release from custody the appellant may qualify
    for housing assistance and qualify for benefits which may make her life
    easier.  It was noted that she had secured  a  number  of  certificates
    whilst in prison in the hope of  improving  her  employability  in  the
    United Kingdom.  The Tribunal went on, however, at paragraph 19 to  say
    as follows:

         "She will have to contend with everyone else in the labour  market,
         particularly those who  have  a  more  proficient  command  of  the
         English  language  and  have  no  convictions  against  them.   She
         confirmed to the probation worker and confirmed to us  today,  that
         it was the temptation of easy money that prompted her taking  these
         substantial and dangerous risks, by smuggling class  A  drugs  into
         United Kingdom."

15.  The Tribunal went on at paragraph 25 in these terms:

         "There can be no suggestion that she has integrated into society in
         Northern Ireland. We are aware of  a  brief  period  when  she  was
         released on bail, between her initial  arrest  and  her  subsequent
         trial where she lived with her aunt.  She confirms  our  suspicions
         that her crime was one of opportunism,  fuelled  by  a  desire  for
         financial gain.  We have concerns  that  because  of  her  criminal
         record,  the  lack  of  English  language  skills,  qualifications,
         support network and social contacts that there  will  be  a  strong
         temptation to become involved  in  criminal  activity  once  again.
         This appellant has been engaged in criminal activity at  the  upper
         end of the scale i.e. drug smuggling.  There is every  probability,
         in our view, on the  evidence  before  us  today,  that  given  any
         temptation  she  would  re-engage  in   illegal   activity.    That
         temptation would be even  greater  as  a  result  of  her  lack  of
         finances."

16.  Thus it was that in paragraph 28 the Tribunal  expressed  that  it  was
    satisfied on the evidence that the personal conduct  of  the  appellant
    supports the decision  that  she  represents  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
    society.

17.  Challenge is made to that finding first of all on the basis that  there
    was little consideration of the probation report which  showed  a  "low
    likelihood of reoffending" and "no evidence of other lifestyle  factors
    relating to offending behaviour".

18.  Mr Shilliday, on behalf of the respondent, invited me to find that  the
    approach taken by the Tribunal to  the  probation  report  set  out  in
    paragraph 20  of  the  determination  was  a  proper  one  in  all  the
    circumstances.  It is to be noted that in his  sentencing  remarks  the
    Judge specifically gives  little  weight  to  the  pre-sentence  report
    precisely because the appellant had been  less  than  honest  with  the
    author of that report, in particular that she had  sought  to  disguise
    the fact that accompanying her was indeed K's father.  The judgment was
    as follows:

         "These came to light on 29th September 2011  when  you  arrived  at
         Belfast/International Airport in the company of another person  who
         was the subject of some interest by the UK Border Agency.


         You initially denied that you had any knowledge of this person  and
         the most that you eventually admitted was that you had met  him  at
         the airport.  It now emerges that not only did you know him but  he
         is in fact the father of your 3 year old  child.   And  that  means
         that the court has to have a certain scepticism about what you told
         Probation, because you certainly didn't tell  Probation  that  this
         gentleman was the father of your child, and also about  your  whole
         background and the reason why you were tempted to  engage  in  this
         pernicious enterprise."


    The Judge went on to indicate that he  was  not  attaching  significant
    weight to what was said to the probation officer, given  that  she  did
    not tell him the whole truth about her situation.

19.  Mr McTaggart invites my attention to the  skeleton  argument  that  had
    been submitted before the Tribunal and highlighted in that document was
    a number of features affecting risk which he submits were not  properly
    considered by the Tribunal.  He submits that the  risk  of  reoffending
    would be lower because of the impact of the period of custody  and  the
    fact of the separation from K.  The rehabilitative impact of custody is
    also stressed together with the fact that the appellant has completed a
    number of courses and qualifications whilst in  prison.   It  was  said
    that her conduct in  prison  was  exemplary.   Further  that  upon  her
    release she would be subject to licence  conditions  for  a  period  of
    twenty months.

20.  He said that K is well-settled into a life  in  Belfast  and  that  the
    appellant has the support of K's father with whom she  shares  a  final
    shared residence order.  He said that the index offences  were  out  of
    character.

21.  It was also argued that the prospects of successful rehabilitation  are
    significantly greater in the UK than if she were forced  to  return  to
    Portugal.

22.  Mr Shilliday submits  that  those  factors  are  largely  a  matter  of
    speculation.  At the time of the decision the Tribunal was  considering
    somebody who was in custody and somebody who had misled  the  probation
    officer charged with her case in important aspects.

23.  More particularly he argued that the issue  of  rehabilitation  in  the
    United Kingdom as opposed to Portugal was misconceived, particularly in
    the light of the decision  of  Essa  (EEA:  rehabilitation/integration)
    [2013] UKUT 00316 (IAC).

24.  In that connection he invited my attention  to  head  note  3  of  that
    decision which reads as follows:

         "For those who at the time of determination are or remain a present
         threat  to  public  policy  but  where  the  factors  relevant   to
         integration  suggest  that  there  are  reasonable   prospects   of
         rehabilitation, those  prospects  can  be  a  substantial  relevant
         factor in the proportionality balance as to whether deportation  is
         justified.  If the claimant cannot constitute a present threat when
         rehabilitated, and is well-advanced in  rehabilitation  in  a  host
         state where there is a substantial degree of  integration,  it  may
         well very well be disproportionate to proceed to deportation."

25.  He submits that in this  case  there  has  been  no  integration.   The
    appellant arrived in Northern Ireland and committed an offence  in  the
    process.  There has been a period in which she was living on  bail  but
    that was a limited period and under the threat  of  imprisonment.   Her
    association  he  submits  with  Northern  Ireland  outside  the  prison
    environment is limited.

26.  It seems to me and I so find that that argument has a degree of merit.

27.  It is clear that  the  offence  was  committed  because  the  appellant
    wanted to come to Northern Ireland and establish a life for herself but
    had neither the means to do so and that led to offending and it is  the
    conclusion of the Tribunal that that risk remains.

28.  Looking at the reasons as a whole I do not find that they have  omitted
    from their consideration any significant factor that  would  materially
    alter that  assessment  of  risk.   They  paid  little  regard  to  the
    probation report for the reasons as given.   They  noted  the  lack  of
    integration of the appellant in society and the difficulties which  she
    would  face  in  further  integration  in   terms   of   language   and
    qualifications, I find little merit in saying that their assessment  of
    risk was not entirely open to them to make.

29.  It is also a matter of some  concern  that  the  father  of  K  is  now
    established in Northern Ireland.  It is not clear whether he is working
    or not working.  He was someone who seemingly accompanied the appellant
    at the time of the commission of the offence.

30.  The next issue is whether it is reasonable for K to return to  Portugal
    with the appellant or whether her best interests are to be protected by
    her remaining in Northern Ireland with her mother.

31.  Mr McTaggart contends that the whole issue of her  best  interests  was
    not properly attended to.  He relies upon the decision of JO and Others
    (section 55 duty) Nigeria [2014] UKUT 00517 (IAC).  That case indicates
    that there is a duty imposed by Section 55 requiring the decision-maker
    to conduct a  careful  examination  of  all  relevant  information  and
    factors.   Being  adequately  informed  and  conducting  a   scrupulous
    analysis are elementary prerequisites  to  the  interrelated  tasks  of
    identifying the child's best interests and  then  balancing  them  with
    other material considerations.  He stressed  that  whether  the  duties
    imposed by Section 55 have been duly performed in any given  case  will
    invariably have been  intensely  fact-sensitive  and  contractual.   Mr
    McTaggart submits that the decision of the respondent is  defective  in
    any event because it was not conformed to those stricter requirements.

32.  It  is  clear  in  the  decision  letter  of  14th  January  2014  that
    consideration was given to K as set out as follows:

         "The Secretary of State is aware that your daughter K, came to  the
         United Kingdom on 15th November 2011.  At this  time  you  were  on
         bail for your index offences.  Your daughter lived with you and her
         paternal great aunt, M C.  Your daughter is now in the care of  her
         father, B S, having been made subject of an interim residence order
         by the courts due to your incarceration.   It  is  clear  therefore
         that there is another family member in the United  Kingdom  who  is
         considered capable of caring for  your  daughter.   Notwithstanding
         this, you claim your daughter resided with you in Lisbon  prior  to
         coming to the United Kingdom.  There  is  nothing  in  the  interim
         residence order that excludes your daughter returning  to  Portugal
         with you should it be decided that it is in her best interest to do
         so.  The Secretary of State is satisfied that your  daughter  would
         not be deprived of the perks of EU citizenship should she return to
         Portugal.


         Given that you were arrested on arrival in the United  Kingdom  and
         spent a relatively short time on bail prior  to  being  imprisoned,
         the Secretary of State does not consider that you formed any family
         or private life here.  In addition, Article 8 of the ECHR does  not
         give the right to choose where you live.  Indeed you have spent the
         majority of your life in Portugal.  You speak the language and have
         claimed that you were able to gain employment, albeit limited."

33.  Mr McTaggart contends that the Secretary of  State  did  not,  however,
    embark upon a determination of the best interests of the child  as  she
    was required to do so.

34.  The Tribunal in JO at paragraph 9 cited Zoumbas v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2013] 1 WLR 3690 in which Lord Hodge  set  out
    some seven principles that should be applied in the approach to Section
    55.  Of particular relevance  was  the  importance  to  ask  the  right
    questions in an  orderly  manner  to  avoid  the  risk  that  the  best
    interests  of  a  child  might  be  undervalued  when  other  important
    considerations were in play.  It was important to have a clear idea  of
    a child's circumstances and of what is  in  a  child's  best  interests
    before asking oneself whether those interests  are  outweighed  by  the
    force of other considerations.  There needs to be a careful examination
    of all relevant factors.

35.  There are a number of unusual features in  this  case.   The  first  is
    that K resided with her mother and/or aunt in  Portugal  at  all  times
    prior to the appellant coming to the United Kingdom for the purposes of
    committing a criminal offence.  It was only during the period  of  bail
    that K came to the United Kingdom in the company of  her  aunt  and  it
    would seem that both she and the  appellant  and  aunt  lived  together
    during the year upon which the appellant was on bail.  Given the nature
    of the offence which was committed it was clearly  inevitable  that  at
    the end of that period of  bail  there  would  have  been  a  custodial
    sentence imposed which indeed there was.   During  that  period,  which
    continues to the First-tier Tribunal hearing, K lived with her father.

36.  Her circumstances were considered in  the  High  Court  of  Justice  in
    Northern Ireland in the Family Division, particularly in the Office  of
    Care and Protection.  There are a number of decisions in the papers. By
    order of 20th March 2013 an interim residence order was granted to  the
    father and an interim contact order was granted  to  the  appellant  so
    that  reasonable  contact  with  the  child   could   be   as   agreed.
    Restrictions  were  also  placed  upon  the  removal  of  K  from   the
    jurisdiction so that it is clear that where a  residence  order  is  in
    force no person may be removed from  the  United  Kingdom  without  the
    written consent of every person with parental responsibility or without
    leave of the court.

37.  At the time of the hearing there was a joint residence order  in  place
    in the sense that the residence order was made in  the  favour  of  K's
    father but it was envisaged that upon release from  prison  maintenance
    for K would be a matter as between the parties.

38.  Thus it seems to me that the important consideration in this  case  was
    that the  interests  of  K  had  been  considered  by  the  appropriate
    authority and relevant orders made.

39.  That situation was acknowledged by the Tribunal as  can  be  seen  from
    paragraph 29 of the determination.  It is relevant to  note  that  from
    29th November 2012 to 23rd April 2014, nearly eighteen  months,  K  had
    been with her father and the appellant had been in  prison.   That  was
    the situation that had been considered by the  appropriate  High  Court
    Family Division and approved.

40.  The First-tier Tribunal embarked upon enquiry at paragraphs 29  and  30
    in relation to Section 55 and it is clear from the context of paragraph
    30 that they proceeded on the basis of K living with her father and  he
    allowing her to have contact with the appellant in Portugal.

41.  The precise basis upon which  Mr  S  is  able  to  remain  in  Northern
    Ireland is far from clear given that, according to the finding  of  the
    Tribunal he has little motivation to find employment and  rather  lives
    on  benefits.   It  is  difficult  to  imagine  therefore  that  he  is
    exercising EEA treaty rights.  However, the position as at the time  of
    the hearing was that he had been granted a residence order in  relation
    to K.  It seems in those circumstances entirely understandable why  the
    Tribunal view the best interests of  K  in  that  light.   Clearly  her
    interests have been considered elsewhere.

42.  Criticism is made of the Tribunal that they underestimated  the  amount
    of time K had spent with the appellant during the course of  her  life.
    As is set out in paragraph  33  of  the  determination,  in  which  the
    Tribunal expressed  themselves  satisfied  that  it  was  in  the  best
    interests of the child to remain with the father or  whoever  the  High
    Court may consider appropriate given her tender age.  It was noted that
    K had established no family or private life  except  with  her  limited
    time with her mother in the United Kingdom.  It was said that  she  had
    spent more time with her grandaunt and father than her mother.  That is
    a matter of some contention.

43.  I note, however, that  there  is  a  document,  a  statement  from  the
    appellant to the High Court  of  Justice  in  Northern  Ireland  Family
    Division dated 24th May 2013.

44.  It would seem that K, who was born on 12th  January  2009,  lived  with
    the appellant at her address in Lisbon until 29th September 2011,  that
    is nearly three years and two months, and thereafter she lived with the
    appellant's sister in Portugal and  then  lived  with  the  sister  and
    appellant for a year in the United Kingdom before the sentence of  20th
    November 2012.

45.  Although that may be mathematically an error it does not, as  it  seems
    to me, materially affect the considerations that applied.   As  can  be
    seen from paragraphs 29 and 30 the Tribunal approached  the  matter  on
    the basis that the court  had  awarded  a  residence  order  to  Mr  S,
    however,  it  recognised  in  paragraph  33  an  alternative  to   that
    situation, commenting as follows:

         "If the father of the child were to return to  Portugal  with  them
         this would be  an  enhancement  for  their  productive  family  and
         private life in Portugal.  It is acknowledged that he has no reason
         why he could not return to Portugal.  The appellant  also  confirms
         she has contacts and family in Portugal.  The child will  accrue  a
         benefit from enjoying Portuguese and UK culture from  both  parents
         if she is to travel between the two countries."

46.  Thus it was envisaged either that the child should stay in  the  United
    Kingdom with her father or to return with him to Portugal.

47.  In any event the Tribunal had borne very much in mind the reality  that
    what should happen to K upon release of her mother would be very much a
    matter for the High Court to determine.  K could not return to Portugal
    without permission to do so from the court.

48.  The submissions of Mr McTaggart are largely premised on the basis  that
    it is in the interests of K to remain in the United  Kingdom  and  that
    the appellant should also remain with her.  The situation has  somewhat
    moved on from the Tribunal decision in that the appellant was  released
    from custody in June 2014 and has subsequently been the  primary  carer
    of K, the father not now living with the child.  She has the benefit of
    the joint residence order.

49.  That, however, was not the position that was before  the  Tribunal  and
    it is important to make that distinction clear.  At  the  time  of  the
    Tribunal's consideration of the best interests of K the  appellant  was
    in custody.  The basis of K coming to the United  Kingdom  perhaps  was
    not fully clarified but it clearly was to be with the appellant  whilst
    on bail.  She had  lived  with  the  appellant  before.   The  Tribunal
    envisaged that one alternative would be for K to return to Portugal  to
    be with her parents or parent as before.

50.  As Mr Shilliday indicated, given that the appellant came to the  United
    Kingdom solely for the purpose of committing criminal offences it would
    be extraordinary that that enabled her  to  claim  a  right  to  remain
    thereafter.  K was, as I have indicated, in the United  Kingdom  during
    the period of her mother's bail but the appellant played little part in
    her care thereafter for obvious reasons.

51.  Although the matter is somewhat more complicated than  otherwise  might
    be case I do not find there to be any obvious error of  approach  taken
    by the Tribunal in relation to the best interests of  the  child.   She
    can either stay in the United Kingdom  under  directions  of  the  High
    Court or return. There would seem to  be  little  reason  why,  if  the
    appellant were not in UK, K could not return live with  her  father  or
    indeed to return to Portugal to live with her mother and/or father.

52.  Looking at the matter overall I do not find any material error  of  law
    in  the  approach  taken  by  the  First-tier   Tribunal.    In   those
    circumstances the appeal before the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

53.  The findings of the First tier Tribunal  shall  therefore  stand.   The
    appeal under the Immigration Regulations is dismissed as is that  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR Convention.





An anonymity direction is made to protect the child

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
