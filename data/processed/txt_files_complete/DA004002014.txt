Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms N Nnamani, Counsel instructed by Samuel Louis
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 13th  August  1958.   His
    appeal against deportation under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006
    was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge R G Walters  in  a  decision
    dated 2nd April 2015.

2.   The Appellant appealed on the grounds that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    adequately consider all relevant matters set out in  Regulation  21(6).
    Secondly, the judge's finding at [30] was  not  sustainable  given  the
    evidence that confiscation proceedings had been withdrawn. Thirdly, the
    judge's finding [36] that the Appellant would not be able to resist the
    temptation of plundering clients' accounts if he were to be employed in
    a solicitors' office again was perverse. Fourthly the judge's Article 8
    findings were unsafe  because  he  had  failed  to  consider  the  best
    interests  of  the  child  and  properly  conduct   a   proportionality
    assessment.

3.   I granted permission to appeal on 19th July 2015 on the basis  that  it
    was arguable that the judge had failed to consider  all  the  mandatory
    requirements of Regulation 21(6) and only  considered  the  Appellant's
    health issues.

4.   The Appellant's immigration history is as follows: He first arrived  in
    the UK on 11th July 1998 on an EEA family permit.  He then left the  UK
    and next entered on another family permit in July 1999.  He again  left
    the UK returning in 2000 on a further EEA family permit.  The Appellant
    applied for a residence card on 25th July 2000 and was issued with  one
    until July  2004.  On  19th  February  2004  the  Appellant  lodged  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain which was  granted  on  20th
    March  2004.   The  Appellant's  application  for  naturalisation   and
    citizenship was refused in 2008.

5.   There was evidence that the Appellant  had  gone  back  to  Nigeria  in
    2006.  It was not known for sure when he re-entered the UK but he  came
    to the attention of the authorities in 2010, when he was  arrested  for
    certain offences and on 5th November 2010 he was convicted at  Kingston
    upon Thames Crown Court for an offence of theft for which  he  received
    five years' imprisonment. There was no appeal against the conviction or
    sentence and the Appellant was released from prison in 2013.

6.   The details of  the  offence  are  as  follows:  The  Applicant  was  a
    solicitor of the Supreme Court and in the course of his practice he  in
    effect defrauded various third parties of a total sum of ï¿½663,000.  The
    money was not traceable and therefore the  Solicitor's  Indemnity  Fund
    had in effect to shoulder the burden.

7.   The Appellant's first appeal against deportation  was  allowed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal and the Secretary of State appealed. Upper Tribunal
    Judge Peter Lane found that the First-tier Tribunal Panel had erred  in
    law in failing to make findings on the whereabouts of  the  Appellant's
    money and failing to consider whether it was  proportionate  to  let  a
    person who had stolen such a large sum  and  either  dissipated  it  or
    hidden it from view, to return to the UK and then resist removal on the
    basis of health needs.  Further,  the  Panel  erred  in  law  in  their
    assessment of whether the Appellant represented a genuine, present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society and in failing  to  have  regard  to  section  117C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  in  the  assessment  of
    proportionality under Article 8. The matter was remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal for rehearing and the Appellant's appeal was dismissed by
    Judge Walters [the judge].

     Submissions

8.    Ms  Nnamani  submitted  that  although  the  judge  had  referred   to
    Regulation 21(6) at [40],  his  findings  at  [41]  onwards  failed  to
    demonstrate that he had applied the Regulation  to  the  facts  of  the
    Appellant's case.  She  submitted  that  the  Respondent  had  to  show
    serious grounds in this case and it was not clear that  the  judge  had
    applied a higher threshold test in finding that the Appellant's removal
    was justified under Regulation 21.

9.   Ms Nnamani accepted that the Appellant's age was not a material  factor
    but submitted that, although the judge had gone  into  the  Appellant's
    health in considerable detail, his findings were inadequate. The  Judge
    had misunderstood the evidence in the 'Businessday' report  in  finding
    that the Appellant would have access to a dialysis unit  when  in  fact
    the village in which he lived was hundreds of miles away from Lagos  or
    Abuja and even further away from the other parts of the  country  where
    dialysis was available. The judge's findings  at  [58]  and  [59]  were
    unsustainable in the light of the evidence in this  report.  The  judge
    had not dealt with the issue of whether the Appellant was able to  move
    to be nearer a dialysis unit.

10.  In  relation  to  family  and  economic  circumstances  the  judge  had
    considered the Appellant's partner and child, who did not  have  status
    in the UK, but he failed to take into account that  the  Appellant  had
    extended family members who  supported  the  Appellant.  The  Appellant
    received assistance from his family in order to survive economically in
    the UK.

11.  The Appellant had been in the UK since 1998 and was  granted  permanent
    residence or indefinite leave to remain in 2004.  Although,  the  judge
    was  aware  of  the  Appellant's  length  of  residence  he  failed  to
    demonstrate that he had taken  it  into  account  in  his  findings  on
    Regulation 21.

12.  The judge also failed to take into account the Appellant's  social  and
    cultural integration in the UK and that the Appellant had worked  prior
    to setting up his own firm. The judge's assessment of  the  Appellant's
    life in the UK was limited to the events since his criminal conviction.
     It was accepted that the Appellant had returned to Nigeria on numerous
    occasions. However, the judge's  assessment  of  the  Appellant  as  an
    individual was lacking. The judge had focused on the offence, which was
    not enough to show serious grounds. The judge had failed to  take  into
    account all factors and to show that he  has  assessed  the  individual
    circumstances of the Appellant. The judge  had  not  demonstrated  that
    there were serious grounds in this case over and above  the  fact  that
    the Appellant was a threat to the fundamental interests of society.

13.  In relation to ground 2, Ms Nnamani  submitted  that  the  judge  dealt
    with the whereabouts of the  money  inadequately.  He  failed  to  give
    reasons for why the Appellant's account was  not  credible  or  why  he
    rejected the Appellant's explanations. There  were  several  errors  in
    [20] to [30] and the cumulative effect of each  was  that  the  judge's
    findings were  unclear  or  insufficiently  reasoned.   If  there  were
    considerable funds then the police would have been able  to  trace  the
    money.   The  police  were  unable  to  do  so  and  that  is  why  the
    confiscation proceedings were not pursued.

14.  In relation  to  ground  3,  Ms  Nnamani  submitted  that  the  judge's
    finding, at [36], on the Appellant's  propensity  to  reoffend  in  the
    future, was perverse. The Appellant had been assessed as  low  risk  of
    reoffending and had undertaken  courses  on  reoffending.  The  judge's
    finding that the Appellant would not be able to resist  the  temptation
    to plunder client accounts was not sustainable  in  the  light  of  the
    probation officer's report and the  judge  failed  to  give  sufficient
    reasons why he disagreed with that report. The reasons at [34] and [35]
    were not sufficient.

15.  In relation to ground 4 and Article 8, Ms Nnamani  submitted  that  the
    judge's findings were inadequately reasoned.

16.  Mr Walker relied on the Rule 24 response and submitted that  the  judge
    had considered all factors set out in Regulation 21(6).  He  considered
    the Appellant's health at [41] to [59].  He considered the  Appellant's
    family life at [68] to [71].  There was evidence that the Appellant had
    separated from his EEA family member who had given him status. He lived
    alone and there was no evidence of a relationship with his daughter and
    partner.

17.  The judge's finding at [70] that the receipts representing payments  to
    S were insufficient to show that the relationship with  the  Appellant,
    his partner and his daughter subsisted, although it was  accepted  that
    the  Appellant  was  S's  father.  The  judge  found  that  there   was
    insufficient evidence to establish family life, but in  any  event  the
    Appellant's partner and daughter were  here  unlawfully  and  therefore
    there would be no interference in any event.

18.  Accordingly, the judge had dealt with health, family life and age.  The
    judge was aware that the Appellant had lived the majority of  his  life
    in Nigeria and had been back to Nigeria frequently. The judge had taken
    into account the Appellant's immigration history at [8] onwards and had
    therefore dealt with all aspects of Regulation 21(6). The fact that the
    judge had set out his findings on family life in relation to Article  8
    after his assessment of Regulation 21  did  not  make  any  difference.
    When the determination was read as a whole the judge had dealt with all
    aspects of the Regulation.

19.   In  relation  to  ground  2  the  judge  considered  the   Appellant's
    explanation for what had happened to the money and found that there was
    one piece of documentary evidence, a poster,  but  no  other  receipts.
    The judge found that whilst it was  accepted  that  the  Appellant  had
    stood for some form of office this did not satisfactorily explain where
    the money went.

20.  The judge took into account the probation report and the fact that  the
    Appellant's offence was a serious breach of trust.   Grounds  2  and  3
    were in a sense disagreements with the  judge's  findings,  which  were
    open to him on the evidence, when the  decision  was  looked  at  as  a
    whole.

21.  In relation to the  availability  of  dialysis  in  Nigeria  the  judge
    considered the costs, the fact that the  Appellant  had  accommodation,
    cousins and a large circle of friends in Nigeria and that dialysis  was
    available throughout the country. If necessary the Appellant could move
    nearer to a dialysis unit and the judge's finding  that  the  Appellant
    could obtain treatment was one which was open to him  on  the  evidence
    before him.

22.  In response, Ms Nnamani  stated  that  the  Appellant  would  not  have
    access to a dialysis unit because there was not one within a reasonable
    distance to the village in which he lived. The judge had approached the
    evidence  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  could  return  to   the
    accommodation in his own village, but had failed to address whether the
    Appellant could access dialysis from where  he  lived  because  of  the
    costs and the distance.  This may not in itself amount to an  error  of
    law, but  taken  with  other  factors  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    Appellant would have access to dialysis was not sustainable.

23.  In relation to the poster the judge's finding that  the  Appellant  had
    considerable funds available to  him  was  not  sustainable  given  the
    confiscation evidence.  The fact that the police  could  not  find  the
    money meant more likely than not it did not  exist  and  therefore  the
    Appellant's account was truthful.  The  judge's  finding  at  [30]  was
    perverse.


Discussion and Conclusions

Ground 1

24.  Regulation 21(6) provides that the judge must  consider  the  following
    factors: age, state  of  health,  family  and  economic  circumstances,
    period of residence, social and  cultural  integration  and  extent  of
    links with country of origin.

25.  The Judge took into account the  Appellant's  age  [1],  his  state  of
    health [41] to  [61],  his  family  circumstances  [62]  to  [71],  his
    economic circumstances [20] to [30], his length  of  residence  [8]  to
    [10], and his social and cultural integration and  links  with  Nigeria
    [11] to [19]. When the determination is read as a whole, all aspects of
    Regulation 21 have been addressed.

26.  It is the Appellant's submission that  the  assessment  was  inadequate
    and the Respondent had failed to show serious grounds in this case.  It
    was not clear that the judge had applied a  higher  threshold  test  in
    finding that the Appellant's removal was justified under Regulation 21.



27.  I am not persuaded by  Ms  Nnamani's  submission  that  the  judge  has
    misunderstood the evidence in the  'Businessday'  report  which  states
    that there were 76 dialysis units all over the country. There  were  20
    dialysis units and 2 transplant units in Lagos. Other south west states
    had 10 dialysis units and 2 transplant  units.  Abuja  had  8  dialysis
    units, while the eleven northern states had 14  dialysis  units  and  3
    transplant units. The southern states had 12  dialysis  units  and  the
    south east had 12 dialysis units, but no kidney transplant facilities.

28.  The judge set out various parts of the report at [51] to [54].   It  is
    clear from this report that there are dialysis units all over  Nigeria.
    The judge found at [58] "The  Appellant  states  that  his  village  is
    hundreds of miles from both Lagos and  Abuja,  but  the  evidence  from
    "Businessday" shows that there are dialysis units  in  many  states  in
    addition to those two cities." This finding was open to  the  Judge  on
    the evidence before him. The Appellant's claim that  there  was  not  a
    unit within reasonable distance of the village in which  he  lives  was
    not made out on the evidence before the judge.

29.  The Judge found that the Appellant had  access  to  funds  and  I  have
    dealt with this issue below. Given this finding,  the  Appellant  would
    not be precluded from travelling such a distance or indeed moving  from
    his village to enable him to have access  to  treatment.  I  find  that
    there is no material error of law in the judge's findings  in  relation
    to the Appellant's health.

30.  The other factors set out in Regulation 21(6) include  the  Appellant's
    age. It was accepted that this was not material and the  judge  had  in
    fact taken it into account.  The judge had looked  at  the  Appellant's
    family situation having  found  that  his  partner  and  daughter  were
    citizens of Nigeria and remained in the UK unlawfully.  The  judge  had
    assessed the economic situation in relation to the whereabouts  of  the
    funds the Appellant stole from clients whilst acting as a solicitor.

31.  The judge also had regard to the Appellant's  length  of  residence  in
    the UK having set out his immigration history at [8] onwards. The judge
    had taken into account the Appellant's social and cultural  integration
    in the UK and in respect of his work as a solicitor. The fact  that  he
    failed to refer to his work prior to the commission of offence was  not
    material. There was  also  evidence  that  the  Appellant  had  visited
    Nigeria several times and had cousins living there. Therefore,  he  was
    not estranged from his country of origin and re-integration was not  an
    issue. Accordingly, the judge had also dealt with  the  extent  of  the
    Appellant's links with his country of origin.

32.  I find that the judge considered all the factors in  Regulation  21(6),
    although arguably he could have set out his decision more  clearly  and
    structured it differently. However, on reading the determination  as  a
    whole, the judge had taken into account all the relevant factors  which
    were mandatory under Regulation 21(6).

33.  I conclude that the judge had properly dealt with Regulation 21(6)  and
    insofar as he had failed to specifically mention any factor that factor
    was not  material  to  his  overall  decision.  His  finding  that  the
    Appellant's deportation was justified under Regulation 21 was  open  to
    the judge on the evidence before him.

     Ground 2

34.  The Appellant's first appeal against deportation was  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal by Upper Tribunal Judge Peter  Lane  on  the  basis
    that the previous Tribunal had erred in law in failing to make findings
    on the whereabouts of the Appellant's  money.  Accordingly,  the  judge
    cannot be criticised for assessing the Appellant's evidence as  to  the
    whereabouts of the funds the Appellant had stolen whilst working  as  a
    solicitor.

35.  The grounds submitted with the application for permission suggest  that
    the judge was not entitled to look behind the fact that the Crown Court
    confiscation proceedings were withdrawn. Ms Nnamani relies on the  fact
    that confiscation proceedings were withdrawn in her submission that the
    judge's findings at [30] were perverse.


36.   The  fact  that  confiscation  proceedings  were  withdrawn  does  not
    preclude the judge from making findings as to the  whereabouts  of  the
    money the Appellant stole. The police were unable to trace  the  money,
    but that does not mean, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  the
    Appellant has indeed spent it or dissipated  it  as  he  claimed.   The
    judge was tasked with enquiring into the whereabouts of  the  money  by
    Upper Tribunal  Judge  Peter  Lane  and  the  judge  carried  out  that
    assessment on the basis  of  the  evidence  before  him  and  the  oral
    evidence of the Appellant.

37.  The Judge found that the Appellant had not  satisfactorily  proved,  on
    the balance of probabilities, that the money had  been  dissipated.  He
    found that the Appellant may well have considerable  amounts  of  funds
    available to him in Nigeria from the proceeds of his crime.

38.  This finding was not perverse given that the Appellant  stole  ï¿½633,000
    and produced an election  poster  as  the  only  piece  of  documentary
    evidence to corroborate where the money went. The judge also found that
    the Appellant's explanation for  where  the  money  had  gone  was  not
    credible and gave adequate reasons for this conclusion at [22] to [29].

39.  The finding on whether the Appellant had access to funds  was  relevant
    to whether the Appellant could access dialysis treatment and  therefore
    it was essential that the judge made findings on that point and why the
    appeal had been remitted by the Upper Tribunal.  The withdrawal of  the
    confiscation proceedings was a matter to be taken into account, but  it
    was not determinative as to the whereabouts of the  funds.   I  am  not
    persuaded that ground 2 has any merit.

     Ground 3

40.  The Judge found at  [36]  that  "...  the  nature  of  the  Appellant's
    offence involved such a serious breach of trust that he poses a  threat
    by reason of the nature of that offence  despite  the  finding  by  the
    Probation Officer of a low risk of re-offending. I do not  accept  that
    the Appellant would not be able to resist the temptation of  plundering
    client accounts if he were ever to be employed, as he  proposes,  in  a
    lawyer's office again."

41.  In  coming  to  this  conclusion,  the  Judge  took  into  account  the
    Probation Report, the courses the Appellant had attended in prison  and
    his oral evidence that he hoped to gain employment  as  a  lawyer.  The
    Judge did not take the view that the  Appellant  was  unlikely  to  re-
    offend because the Appellant commenced stealing from his clients within
    weeks of setting up his firm and continued stealing after he went  back
    to Nigeria.

42.  The judge's finding at [36] was open to him on the evidence before  him
    and he gave adequate reasons at [34] and [35].

     Ground 4

43.  In relation to Article 8, the judge had regard to Section 117C  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and specifically  referred
    to it at paragraph 72. Again, the judge could well have structured  his
    findings more appropriately in order to demonstrate the factors he  had
    taken into account, but the fact remains that the Appellant had  failed
    to establish family life in the UK. There was insufficient evidence  to
    show that the Appellant had a subsisting relationship with his  partner
    and daughter, who in any event, were in the  UK  unlawfully  and  could
    return to Nigeria as Nigerian citizens.

44.  The Appellant's private life such as it was with  his  extended  family
    members and work could be replicated in Nigeria  given  his  access  to
    funds and accommodation and therefore  the  judge's  finding  that  his
    deportation  was  proportionate  was  open  to  him  on  the  evidence,
    particularly having  regard  to  the  significant  public  interest  in
    deporting foreign criminals.

     Conclusion

45.  Accordingly I find that there was no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    judge's decision and the decision dated 2nd  April  2015  shall  stand.
    The appeal was properly dismissed under the Immigration  Rules  and  on
    human rights grounds.
