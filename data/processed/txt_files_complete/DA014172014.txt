Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Campbell, counsel, instructed by Maya
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The First-tier Tribunal in a determination promulgated on 2nd
       September 2014 dismissed the appellant's appeal on human rights
       grounds against the deportation order made pursuant to s32 UK Borders
       Act 2007. The panel that heard the appeal found that the decision was
       proportionate and that the appellant did not meet the requirements of
       the Immigration Rules.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by UT Judge Rintoul on 15th January
       2015 on grounds that it was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal had
       erred in not making a finding "pursuant to paragraph 399A as to
       whether the appellant had lost all ties to Bangladesh". The grounds
       had submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to consider
       Ogundimu (Article 8 - new Rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060 (IAC) in
       determining the question of ties ([1] to [10] of the grounds). The
       grounds further asserted ([11]) that the First-tier Tribunal had
       erred in "failing to fully consider the Appellant's appeal under the
       Immigration Rules and furthermore failed to provide sufficient
       reasons for not doing so".

    3. The paragraph of the Rules relied upon in grounds set out in [1] to
       [10] had been deleted from the Rules by the date of the hearing of
       the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal and a new paragraph 399A
       substituted by HC 532. Ms Campbell accepted that there was no merit
       in the grounds [1] to [10] as formulated because they addressed a
       Rule that had ceased to have any effect by the date of the hearing.

    4. In so far as [11] of the grounds was concerned she accepted that this
       did not particularise the challenge to the determination of the First-
       tier Tribunal. Mr Mills accepted that in so far as paragraph 399A was
       concerned the appellant met 399A(a) and (b). Ms Campbell confirmed
       that permission to appeal had not been sought on the grounds that the
       judge had failed to consider and make findings upon 399A(c)
       specifically but submitted that on a generous reading of [11] of the
       grounds this could be read into that paragraph. I do not agree.

    5. In any event, Ms Campbell accepted that there had been no evidence to
       the First-tier Tribunal and no submission that the appellant would
       face "very significant obstacles to his integration into the country
       to which it is proposed that he is deported". The First-tier Tribunal
       cannot be criticised for failing to consider evidence that was not
       put or submissions that were not made.

  Conclusion

    6. I am therefore satisfied that there is no error of law such that the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal be set aside to be remade.

    7. I do not set aside the decision.

    8. The appeal is dismissed and the determination of the First-tier
       Tribunal stands.
