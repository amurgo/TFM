                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born in 1987. He  arrived  in
       the UK in October 2009 and was granted leave to enter  as  a  student
       until March 2013, and that leave was extended until January 2015.  He
       then overstayed, and in October 2015 he  applied  to  remain  on  the
       basis of  his  private  and  family  life  ties  with  the  UK.  This
       application was refused in February 2016. A similar application  made
       in May 2016 was refused in March  2017.  The  appellant  applied  for
       asylum in July 2017, and his application was refused  on  20th  April
       2018.  His appeal against the decision to refuse asylum was dismissed
       on  all  grounds  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  S  Taylor   in   a
       determination promulgated on the 18th December 2019.  Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Lindsley found that the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in  law
       for the reasons set out in her decision of 8th June  2020,  which  is
       appended as Annex A to this decision.

    2. The remaking of this appeal now comes before us.  The  hearing  is  a
       remote one heard via Skype for Business in order to limit the  spread
       of the Covid-19 virus, and in circumstances where this is  agreed  to
       be a fair and just way to remake the appeal  by  the  parties.  There
       were no significant problems of  audibility  or  connectivity  during
       this hearing; although there were occasional lapses  of  connectivity
       in the court for the judges and also for the interpreter  these  were
       observed and the hearing halted and recapped so that  no  information
       was lost. We are satisfied that all  evidence  and  submissions  were
       heard by everyone involved.

Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

    3.  The  appellant  gave  evidence  through   the   Tribunal   Sinhalese
       interpreter  and  confirmed  his  identity  and  that  his   unsigned
       statement was true and correct, and had been read back to  him  in  a
       language he understood. We accepted that due  to  his  mental  health
       problems the appellant is a vulnerable witness,  and  asked  that  Mr
       Blake confirm that he was happy with the conduct of the  proceedings,
       and asked him to draw  any  issues  that  needed  addressing  to  our
       attention should they arise. Nothing was drawn to  our  attention  in
       this respect. In short summary the  appellant's  evidence,  from  his
       statement and answers to cross-examination  from  Mr  Melvin,  is  as
       follows.

    4. The appellant is a Sri Lankan  citizen  of  Sinhalese  ethnicity.  In
       November 2007, whilst living in Colombo,  Sri  Lanka,  the  appellant
       witnessed a bomb explosion in which he saw a lot of wounded and  dead
       people and body parts in the blast area. This incident is material in
       relation to the post-traumatic stress disorder  and  anxiety  he  now
       suffers, but is not part of his  reasons  for  claiming  asylum.  The
       appellant  says  that  he  has  seen  his  GP  about  suffering  from
       depression  and  anxiety,  and  takes   sertraline   and   paroxetine
       medications. He has had psychotherapy  but  at  present  one  to  one
       sessions have stopped due to coronavirus. He has an appointment  with
       his GP next Friday to discuss his mental health.

    5. Prior to coming to the UK to study the appellant worked for  bank  in
       Colombo. The appellant met a Tamil woman, LT, in 2007 who  worked  in
       another bank in Colombo and started dating. They became close and had
       agreed between themselves that they  would  marry.  His  family  were
       happy with this, and he believes hers were  too,  although  he  never
       spoke to them directly as he does not speak Tamil and  he  never  met
       them as they lived in the north of Sri Lanka. He had  photographs  of
       himself and his girlfriend in Sri  Lanka  but  these  stayed  in  his
       family home and he did not bring them to the UK,  as  he  planned  to
       return to his home country at the end of his studies.

    6. In October 2009 the appellant travelled to the  UK  with  a  visa  to
       study. He kept in touch with his girlfriend whilst he was studying in
       the UK using a pay as you go mobile  telephone  which  he  no  longer
       owns, and therefore he cannot document those calls. He  did  not  use
       social media at that time. His girlfriend asked if he could loan  her
       father some  money  for  his  business,  and  in  December  2012  the
       appellant sent �1000 through a money transfer agency. He sent another
       �1000 in mid 2013, and �750 at the beginning of 2014.  The  transfers
       were all made using A1 Money Transfer Agency in  East  Ham.  He  used
       this agency as it was closed to friends he  visited.  Whilst  he  was
       based in Wrexham for his studies he returned for weekends  and  short
       holidays to stay with friends in  East  Ham.  He  did  not  keep  the
       tickets for his travel to see his friends as he  did  not  know  they
       would be relevant at  the  time.   Likewise,  he  did  not  think  it
       relevant to keep the receipts for the transfers  after  he  sent  the
       money and he had checked it had been received. The money was given to
       the agency in cash, and the Barclays account that he took  money  out
       of for the transfers has been closed down as he ceased to use it, and
       he has no old statements and had not been advised to try to  get  old
       statements from them. The appellant therefore accepts that he has  no
       documentary evidence of these transfers. He cannot  go  back  to  the
       agency as it has since closed down. He was able to send money  as  he
       had permission to work in the UK up to 20 hours a week in  term  time
       and full time in the holidays at that time. After he had  sent  these
       amounts of money his girlfriend told him that the business  was  fine
       and did not ask for any more money. He never had any  direct  contact
       with her parents about the money as they were not able to communicate
       as they had no common  language.  The  last  time  he  spoke  to  his
       girlfriend was on 14th April 2014 when he called to  wish  her  happy
       Sinhala-Tamil new year.

    7. On 1st May 2014 the appellant's parents were visited at home by  five
       army and police officers, and told that he was sought as a member  of
       the LTTE, and shown a picture of his girlfriend in LTTE uniform.  The
       authorities told his parents he was working for his girlfriend in the
       UK to rebuild to the LTTE, and took documents and photographs of  him
       and his girlfriend from the family home. His father called him from a
       public telephone to tell him this information. The appellant  had  no
       idea that his girlfriend was a member of the LTTE, he  felt  betrayed
       by her and tried to get in touch (by calling her, getting his  family
       to try to contact the bank where she had  worked  and  by  getting  a
       friend to go to the place where she used to live) but was  unable  to
       find any trace of her. He suspects she may have been arrested.

    8. The appellant extended his leave to remain in the  UK  as  a  student
       until 26th October 2015. In August 2015 his family home  was  visited
       again by the Sri Lankan authorities, so he applied to remain  in  the
       UK on human rights grounds, firstly in February 2016 and then in  May
       2016, both these applications being refused. He did not claim  asylum
       at this stage because he was scared of admitting to  anyone  that  he
       was accused of being part of the LTTE, and was aware that this was  a
       terrorist organisation banned not only in Sri Lanka but also  in  the
       UK and other countries.  He  did  not  understand  about  the  asylum
       process, but at that stage would not have thought it would  apply  to
       him as he is not a Tamil. As he did not divulge the real reasons  for
       his wishing to stay in the UK due to being scared, he was not advised
       to claim asylum by the solicitors who helped  him  with  the  private
       life applications to remain in the UK. This was also the  reason  why
       he did not seek medical help from his GP for his trauma  until  2017;
       even though  the  events  from  2014  caused  his  mental  health  to
       deteriorate he was scared to talk about what had  happened  with  his
       being accused of helping the LTTE.

    9. In April 2017 his parents  were  visited  again  by  the  Sri  Lankan
       authorities. He then sought legal  advice  at  the  suggestion  of  a
       friend in whom he finally confided, and made an asylum claim in  July
       2017. His father was summoned to the police station  in  August  2017
       and his father's  life  was  threatened  if  the  appellant  did  not
       surrender. On 20th January 2018 his father was arrested and  detained
       for two days by the Sri Lankan authorities. His father  continues  to
       have to report to the police in the village once a month, but has not
       been served with any documentation regard this.  The  appellant  does
       not know why his family chose not to seek advice  from  a  lawyer  in
       2014, or if they have requested copies of the arrest warrant for him,
       and why they have not sought help from a human rights organisation in
       Sri Lanka. The appellant believes that if he is returned to Sri Lanka
       he will be detained and tortured on the basis of his imputed  support
       for Tamil separatism.

   10. In support of his claim the appellant submits the following  evidence
       in addition to his own testimony:

         . Evidence of the qualifications he has acquired in the  UK  as  a
           result  of   his   studies:   namely   a   Level   5   BTEC   in
           electrical/electronic engineering awarded in  June  2012  and  a
           diploma of  higher  education  in  aeronautical  and  mechanical
           engineering awarded in October 2015.

         . A report from Dr Zapata, consultant psychiatrist, dated November
           2018, who records that the appellant approached his GP suffering
           from mental health problems in  2017  and  was  diagnosed  as  a
           suffering from PTSD and prescribed anti-depressants and  talking
           therapy. Dr Zapata diagnoses the  appellant  as  suffering  from
           post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the bomb explosion
           in 2007, which has re-surfaced since 2014, since which point  he
           had been suffering from  anxiety  attacks,  insomnia,  intrusive
           memories and nightmares. Dr  Zapata  finds  that  the  delay  in
           claiming asylum is consistent with the appellant's psychological
           state of depression  and  anxiety.  He  also  records  that  the
           appellant had an active plan to kill himself by hanging in 2017,
           but that at the time of the  report  in  2018  he  had  suicidal
           thoughts but no  actual  plans,  and  that  his  family  were  a
           protective factor in this respect. He finds that a high risk  of
           suicide would exist if he were to face imminent removal  to  Sri
           Lanka. He  considers  whether  the  appellant  is  feigning  his
           symptoms but concludes that he is not doing so.

         . Letters from NHS CNWL  Talking  Therapies  from  2017  regarding
           anxiety and suicidal thoughts and a moderate to severe  risk  of
           acting on those thoughts; GP notes; and copy  prescriptions  for
           sertraline and paroxetine.

         . A letter from the appellant's father dated 27th October 2018  in
           which he details being visited by the Maharagama district police
           station, first on 1st May 2014, and then in  August  2015,  then
           being required to report to them on 5th August  2017  and  being
           detained for two days on reporting on 20th January 2018. He says
           that  on  the  first  visit  he  was  shown  a  picture  of  the
           appellant's girl-friend and was able to  recognise  her  in  her
           LTTE uniform, and that documents  including  photo  albums  were
           taken from the family home. He says that  the  authorities  have
           told him that the appellant is a Sinhala LTTE member and that he
           had sent large sums of money to Sri Lanka  to  support  the  re-
           emergence of the LTTE.

         . A letter from Mr Mohamad Dhailamy, a Sri Lankan attorney,  dated
           16th November 2018, along with his Sri Lankan Bar Association ID
           and extract from the Lawyer's Directory  of  2017.  Mr  Dhailamy
           details how he was instructed by the  appellant's  mother  as  a
           result of the detention of  her  husband  in  January  2018.  He
           explains how he went to the police  station  in  Maharagama  and
           talked to officers who told him that the appellant was wanted as
           a LTTE terrorist. He understood that it was  the  contention  of
           the police that the appellant had been dispatched to  London  by
           the LTTE and had sent vast sums of money to Sri Lanka to support
           the LTTE. He records that he was not successful in obtaining the
           release of the appellant's father, but he was in  fact  released
           the following day.

         . Country of origin  materials  including  CPIN  Sri  Lanka  Tamil
           Separatism of May 2020 (Version 6).

   11. It is submitted for the respondent  that  it  is  accepted  that  the
       appellant is a Sri Lankan citizen who has been  diagnosed  as  having
       PTSD as a result of an accident which does not relate to  the  asylum
       claim which took place in 2007 but it is not accepted:

         . that the appellant had a girlfriend as there is  no  documentary
           evidence of the seven-year claimed serious relationship, such as
           communication via text, Facebook, or greetings  cards,  and  the
           appellant could produce no photographs of his girlfriend  or  of
           both of them together, which was not credible if there had  been
           such a relationship.

         . that the appellant transferred �2500 from the UK  to  Sri  Lanka
           given the lack of documentary evidence such as transfer slips or
           bank statements showing the withdrawal of the money; and  it  is
           argued that it is not plausible he would use an agency  in  East
           Ham when he was living in Wrexham.

         . the existence of an arrest warrant and court summons given there
           had been no attempts to get copies of these documents  from  the
           Sri Lankan authorities. It is submitted that the  evidence  from
           the lawyer does not create a rebuttable presumption with regards
           to the documents. The appellant's  father  ought  to  have  been
           taken to court if he were detained more than  24  hours,  rather
           than just be released after 2 days, and  it  would  be  expected
           that the appellant's family would have sought legal help or help
           from a human rights organisation if they were being harassed  by
           the authorities.  Further lawyers' letters have been shown to be
           90% false  in  research  by  the  British  High  Commission,  as
           evidenced by a letter in the respondent's bundle.  The  evidence
           from the father should be treated with caution as  it  was  only
           produced in 2018 and not at the start of the asylum claim. It is
           further argued that, in any case, the  appellant  would  not  be
           seen as having a significant role in the post conflict  diaspora
           given the relatively low amount transferred to Sri  Lanka,  i.e.
           �2750, and given that it will be clear that the appellant is not
           a significant member of the diaspora.

         . the medical evidence does not show an  Article  3  ECHR  medical
           claim, there was a lack of documentary evidence with regards the
           appellant's current state of health which could not be blamed on
           the Covid-19 pandemic. The current CPIN of July 2020 on  Medical
           Treatment and Health Care in Sri Lanka showed that  there  would
           be sufficient  mental  health  treatment  and  in  addition  the
           appellant would have his family to turn to for care.

   12. As a result, it is argued for the respondent that the  appellant  has
       not shown he has a well-founded fear of persecution on return to  Sri
       Lanka, or that he is entitled to succeed on grounds  of  humanitarian
       protection or on human rights grounds, as his claim is  not  credible
       on the lower civil standard of proof.

   13. It is argued for the appellant that  the  respondent  is  now  taking
       points that they did not take in the refusal  letter  or  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal, which is not something that they ought to do. It
       is argued that the appellant ought to  be  treated  as  a  vulnerable
       witness.

   14.  It is argued that the medical evidence of Dr Zapata shows  not  only
       his original trauma in 2007,  but  also  a  subsequent  breakdown  in
       mental health from 2014 onwards. It is argued  that  there  are  good
       reasons  why  there  is  no  direct  documentary  evidence   of   the
       appellant's girlfriend as his photo albums in the  family  home  were
       taken by police, but it is argued that her existence is  corroborated
       in the letters from the lawyer and  the  appellant's  father.  It  is
       argued that there is a  good  reason  why  there  is  no  documentary
       evidence of his financial transfers to her because the money transfer
       firm he used had closed down and he had understandably not  kept  the
       receipts. It is also said that it would not generally be  likely  for
       the appellant's family to be given a warrant,  see  the  respondent's
       CPIN Sri Lanka Tamil Separatism of May 2020 (Version 6) at  paragraph
       4.7.5.

   15. It is further submitted that the letter from the  appellant's  lawyer
       and the letter  from  his  father  are  good  corroborative  evidence
       supporting his history. It is likely that he is on a watch list as  a
       person seen as a threat to the integrity of the Sri Lankan state as a
       result of his girlfriend's actions, and therefore that he has a well-
       founded fear of persecution  on  account  of  his  imputed  political
       opinions, applying the country guidance case of GJ.  The  LTTE  is  a
       proscribed organisation, and in 2014 there is country evidence of the
       Sri Lankan authorities taking action against others who they believed
       were acting on behalf of the LTTE as there were extensive search  and
       investigation activities at that time, which  is  supportive  of  the
       time line in the  appellant's  history.  It  is  submitted  that  the
       explanation for the timing of the claim, and the delay  being  caused
       by fear about admitting to the accusations of  LTTE  membership  were
       plausible. We were also asked to note that the appellant was not  the
       "standard" asylum seeker as he was educated and from a good Sinhalese
       home. It is argued that the evidence of the appellant is  consistent,
       and also consistent with the lawyer's letter and the letter from  his
       father.

   16. On behalf of the appellant, it is further argued that it has not been
       possible to update the 2018 medical evidence of Dr Zapata due to  the
       Covid-19 pandemic; this report should be taken with  the  appellant's
       own evidence to assess his current mental  health,  and  that  he  is
       therefore a suicide risk if returned to Sri Lanka. It is argued  that
       he would be at real risk of committing suicide  if  returned  to  Sri
       Lanka, and that his removal would represent a  breach  of  Article  3
       ECHR on these grounds too. This is because the appellant subjectively
       genuinely believes that he will be detained and tortured  on  return,
       and there is insufficient mental health provision to provide for  his
       mental health problems if he is sent back to Sri Lanka.

  Conclusions - Remaking

   17. The primary question in this appeal is whether  the  history  of  the
       appellant is credible. This must be assessed in the round.

   18. The appellant has provided a very detailed witness statement and gave
       straightforward answers to the questions  put  to  him  under  cross-
       examination from Mr Melvin. He is consistent in his statement and  in
       his oral testimony, and his evidence is consistent with  the  factual
       material in the medical evidence (GP,  therapist,  prescriptions  and
       psychiatric report of Dr Zapata), in his father's letter and the  Sri
       Lankan lawyer's letter from Mr Dhailamy.

   19. We find that the appellant has  given  proper  explanations  for  the
       absence of documentary evidence which might have  been  available  to
       support his claim. We accept that he could have left  his  photograph
       albums with his pictures of him and his fianc�e  in  Sri  Lanka  (his
       original plan was to spend a relatively short period in the  UK)  and
       his evidence is that these were seized by the police in 2014 and thus
       that  it  is  plausible  he  has  no  photographic  evidence  of  his
       relationship. We accept that it is highly plausible that he no longer
       has the telephone he had between 2009 and 2014, so cannot  print  out
       text messages between them. We accept that it was likely he would not
       have kept the receipts from his  financial  transfers  to  his  girl-
       friend after establishing that the money had arrived  with  her,  and
       had not been advised to try and get  old  bank  statements  from  his
       closed bank account to show withdrawal of funds around  the  time  of
       those transfers as this evidence would not show that money  had  been
       sent to Sri Lanka. As for the suggestion that the appellant's  family
       should have been able to produce evidence of arrest warrants, we note
       paragraph 4.7.5 of the May  2020  CPIN,  where  it  is  stated:  "The
       Attorney General's Department told the UK FFT  that  arrest  warrants
       are not issued to the wanted person or their family." It is therefore
       reasonable that the appellant does not have such  documents  as  they
       would not have been given to his family. Further at  paragraph  4.7.6
       of the same document, drawn to our attention  by  Mr  Melvin,  it  is
       stated only that a summons "might" be given to family if  the  wanted
       person was not there, obviously leaving open the possibility that  it
       might not.

   20. We do not find that it is implausible that the appellant  would  have
       made the money transfers from East Ham whilst studying in Wrexham. He
       had previously studied in London, and so it was  plausible  he  would
       have made friends there and returned there for short  weekend  breaks
       and that he would have used an agent to send  the  money  during  his
       time in London on the three claimed occasions. As the  appellant  has
       said he was allowed to work and took that opportunity  and  there  is
       nothing inherently implausible about his deciding to  send  funds  to
       help his fianc�e's father's business.

   21. It has been argued that the delay in  claiming  asylum  is  something
       that should lead us to find the appellant's credibility  is  damaged.
       We accept that this could  be  the  case  as,  on  face  of  it,  the
       appellant has waited some four years from the first problems  in  Sri
       Lanka to the point when he claimed asylum, and in the meanwhile  made
       three other claims to extend his leave: the first being on the  basis
       of being a student and then two private  life  human  rights  claims.
       However, we find the explanation for his delay given by the appellant
       to be convincing. He has said that he was frightened and  ashamed  of
       being accused of being a LTTE supporter  and  being  wanted  on  this
       basis. He was not part of a movement or ethnicity  that  offered  any
       sort of general support to the LTTE. He  viewed  them  as  proscribed
       terrorists and was aware that  this  was  the  view  of  the  British
       government as well as the Sri Lankan authorities. As a result he  did
       not  tell  his  lawyers,  who  helped  him  with  his  human   rights
       applications, or seek  a  doctor's  appointment  about  his  problems
       despite suffering a resurgence of his latent  PTSD  caused  by  being
       caught up in the bomb explosion in 2007, and anxiety and  depression.
       We find that it is plausible that  the  claim,  made  in  July  2017,
       followed renewed interest in him by the authorities and  a  visit  to
       his father on 20th April 2017 and that this was the trigger  for  him
       to finally manage to have  a  discussion  with  a  friend  about  his
       predicament. As the appellant has claimed, having  realised  that  he
       was able to safely unburden himself and make an asylum claim, he then
       simultaneously approached the home office and registered with  a  GP,
       and was diagnosed with PTSD in September 2017. It is clear  from  the
       letter from CNWL Talking Therapies dated 20th October  2017  that  he
       had coped with his anxieties historically by "withdrawal, suppression
       and trying to push these thoughts away", but at  that  point  he  was
       anxious and depressed, with a moderate or severe risk  of  acting  on
       suicidal thoughts due to fear of the Sri Lankan authorities.

   22. The psychiatric report of Dr Zapata reaches a diagnosis of PTSD  with
       depression and anxiety and  some  suicidal  ideation  but  no  active
       suicidal  intention,  which  is  consistent  with  the  preceding  GP
       diagnosis, the prescribed medications and the  letters  from  Talking
       Therapies. Dr Zapata's report is in a proper format, from a  suitably
       qualified  doctor  and  includes  a  statement  of  truth;   in   the
       circumstances, we find it is a report which is deserving  of  weight.
       Whilst considering  whether  the  appellant  could  be  feigning  his
       symptoms, Dr Zapata concludes that the appellant was genuinely afraid
       of being detained and tortured  by  the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  if
       returned to that country. He rightly does not express an  opinion  as
       to whether those fears are well-founded.

   23. It has been drawn to our attention by Mr  Melvin  that  in  the  Home
       Office bundle there is a letter  from  the  British  High  Commission
       dated 5th June 2017 regarding verification of documents, which  found
       that 91% were not genuine. We note, however, that this letter related
       to  "documents  purporting  to  be  Sri  Lankan  Police   and   Court
       certificates, and therefore is not direct evidence  with  respect  to
       the general reliability of lawyer's letters.  Of  course,  we  accept
       that there may also be forgery of lawyers' letters  from  Sri  Lanka,
       and we cannot be certain this  letter  is  genuine.  That  said,  the
       appellant has provided good evidence that the apparent author of this
       letter is an attorney registered with the Sri Lankan Bar Association.
       The letter has full contact details set out,  and  was  sent  to  the
       address of the appellant's UK solicitors, and there is nothing in its
       lay out or content which suggests that it is not genuine. We  further
       note that the letter is not simply an  account  of  reported  matters
       given to the lawyer by the appellant's family: it is  an  account  of
       the lawyer himself, being instructed by the  appellant's  mother,  to
       assist the appellant's father who  was  in  detention,  and  of  this
       lawyer going to the police station and being told that the  appellant
       was under terrorist investigation due to his  supplying  funds  to  a
       female member of the LTTE and so being suspected  of  trying  to  re-
       establish the LTTE.

   24. We do not find that the weight to be given to the lawyer's letter  is
       diminished by the family not reporting the matter to a  human  rights
       organisation or getting further legal help: the  appellant  does  not
       know why they have not taken these options but it seems to  us  there
       are a number of likely reasonable explanations:  for  instance,  that
       they may think that such acts might escalate  their  problems  rather
       than diminish them or simply not wish to spend time and money in this
       way unless it is essential. It is notable that  the  lawyer's  letter
       relates to the most serious thing that is said to  have  happened  to
       the appellant's father, being held for two days, and thus there is  a
       logic that this was the matter for which the appellant's family  used
       a lawyer. We do not find that its veracity is diminished by the  fact
       what is said at paragraph 4.7.2 of the May 2020 CPIN, as submitted by
       Mr Melvin (namely that under the Code of Criminal Procedure Act  that
       a magistrate must authorise the detention  of  a  suspect  beyond  24
       hours), as in the very next paragraph of  the  report,  4.7.3  it  is
       added that the police  can  take  "extraordinary  powers  of  arrest"
       without the involvement of a judge, and this increases  the  risk  of
       arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment.  The  fact  that  the
       lawyer was told in the police station that  the  appellant  had  sent
       vast amounts of money, without citing an amount,  may  have  been  an
       exaggeration by the officer, or the officer's assessment of �2500, or
       may reflect the mistaken belief that the appellant had sent more than
       that amount. We do not find it a matter which affects our  assessment
       of the credibility of the lawyer's letter.

   25. We also  consider  the  evidence,  drawn  to  our  attention  by  the
       appellant's representative, Mr Blake, from Refworld  UNHCR  entitled:
       Sri Lanka: Treatment of non-Tamil  supporters  of  the  LTTE  by  the
       government:  whether  religious  minorities  are   viewed   as   LTTE
       supporters, including Muslims and  Christians,  and  their  Treatment
       dated 5th February 2013, which cites (at  paragraph  3)  evidence  of
       Sinhalese support for the LTTE being a  matter  which  likely  to  be
       shown "no mercy" by the government. It is clearly credible  that  the
       Sri Lankan authorities would take decisive action  if  they  believed
       that a Sinhalese person was supporting the LTTE, and that the context
       is that this would not be unknown to the authorities as a possibility
       at the time when the appellant became a suspect.

   26. We assess all of the above evidence in the round and conclude that we
       find the appellant credible and his evidence  genuine,  applying  the
       lower civil standard of proof applicable in an asylum claim,  because
       - for the reasons set out above - we find it  consistent,  plausible,
       and indicative of the appellant's subjective fear of  return  to  Sri
       Lanka  -  reflected  in  his  psychological  condition  of   anxiety,
       depression and suicidal thoughts - being objectively well founded. We
       place particular weight on the letter from the lawyer,  Mr  Dhailamy,
       and the letter from the appellant's father, showing  that  he  is  at
       real risk of being detained on returned to Sri Lanka as a  result  of
       the outstanding LTTE terrorist charges against him. We  do  not  find
       that the fact that a period of years  has  elapsed  since  the  money
       transfers will reduce the risk as these are grave charges relating to
       terrorism.

   27. We then turn to the current country  guidance  authority  of  GJ  and
       Others (post-civil war; returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT  319.  We
       find that, on the  evidence  as  outlined  above,  the  appellant  is
       perceived as a threat to the integrity of Sri  Lanka  because  he  is
       perceived  to  have  a  significant  role  in   post-conflict   Tamil
       separatism, as he  is  wanted  by  the  police  for  supporting  LTTE
       terrorism. We find that it is  likely  that  the  appellant  will  be
       detained and interrogated about this matter if he is returned to  Sri
       Lanka and, in accordance with the guidance in  GJ, it is likely  that
       he will be subjected to ill-treatment and  torture  during  any  such
       period  of  detention  and  interrogation.  The  appellant  therefore
       succeeds in his asylum appeal on the basis he has a well-founded fear
       of persecution based on his imputed political opinions if returned to
       Sri Lanka. For the same reasons he is entitled to  succeed  on  human
       rights grounds.

   28. We do not find, however, that the appellant has shown that  he  would
       be at Article 3 ECHR medical risk on return to Sri Lanka as a  result
       of his PTSD, depression, anxiety and suicide risk. Dr Zapata found in
       November 2018 that the appellant had some suicidal  thinking  but  no
       planning or intent, although if he were faced with  imminent  removal
       then his suicide risk would be  likely  to  increase  to  very  risky
       levels. However, the medical evidence from Dr  Zapata  is  two  years
       old, as is that from the GP and  therapists,  and  the  only  current
       evidence we have, which we accept, is the evidence of  the  appellant
       that he continues to take his antidepressant  medications.  This,  we
       conclude, does not amount to sufficient substantial evidence to find,
       applying the lower civil standard of proof,  that at the current time
       return to Sri Lanka would expose the appellant to  a  serious,  rapid
       and irreversible health decline, resulting in intense suffering or  a
       significant reduction in life expectancy in the context of the health
       care available to him in Sri  Lanka.   Thus  we  conclude  that   the
       evidence is  insufficient  for  us  to  find  that  the  test  in  AM
       (Zimbabwe) v SSHD [2020] UKSC 17 is met. In addition, the appellant's
       representative did not take us to any evidence which would enable  us
       to find that the Sri Lankan medical services would  not  be  able  to
       provide adequate treatment for the appellant if  he  were  to  become
       unwell in this way, or engage  with  the  protective  factor  of  his
       family. So, in relation to  this  separate  Article  3  ECHR  medical
       issue, we do not find that the appellant is entitled  to  succeed  in
       his appeal.

  Decision:

    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2. We set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and all  of  the
       findings.

    3. We remake the appeal allowing it on asylum and human rights grounds.




       Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
       2008 (SI 2008/269) we make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the  Upper
       Tribunal or a Court directs otherwise, no report of these proceedings
       or any form of  publication  thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly
       identify the original appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst
       others, all parties. Any failure to comply with this direction  could
       give rise to contempt of court proceedings. We  do  so  in  order  to
       avoid a likelihood of serious harm arising to the appellant  and  his
       family from the contents of his protection claim.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision

                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka born in 1987. He  arrived  in
       the UK in October 2009 and was granted leave to enter  as  a  student
       until March 2013, and that leave was extended until January 2015.  He
       then overstayed and in October 2015 applied to remain on the basis of
       his private and family life ties with the UK.  This  application  was
       refused in February 2016. A similar application made in May 2016  was
       refused in March 2017. The appellant applied for  asylum  July  2017,
       and his application was refused  on  20th  April  2018.   His  appeal
       against the decision to refuse asylum was dismissed on all grounds by
       First-tier Tribunal Judge S Taylor in a determination promulgated  on
       the 18th December 2019.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Norton-
       Taylor on all grounds on 26th February 2020, primarily on  the  basis
       that it was arguable that the First-tier judge had erred  in  law  in
       the  treatment  of  the   psychiatric   report   and   by   requiring
       corroborative evidence from the  appellant  on  a  number  of  issues
       including one which may not have been raised as a live issue prior to
       or at the hearing, in the context of the appellant not attending  the
       hearing for health reasons.

    3. In light of the need to take precautions against the spread of Covid-
       19 and with regard to the overriding object  set  out  in  the  Upper
       Tribunal  Procedure  Rules  to  decide  matters  fairly  and   justly
       directions were sent out to the parties by  email  on  5th  May  2020
       seeking written submissions on the assertion of an error of law  from
       with a view to determining that issue on the papers,  and  giving  an
       opportunity for any party who felt that a hearing  was  necessary  in
       the interests of justice to  make  submissions  on  that  issue  too.
       Submissions were received from the respondent only.

    4. The matter came before me to determine whether it is in the interests
       of justice to decide this matter without  a  hearing  and  if  so  to
       determine whether the First-tier Tribunal has erred in  law.  As  the
       respondent has conceded that there is a material error of law in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal I find that it is appropriate  to
       determine this matter on the papers notwithstanding the apparent lack
       of response from the appellant's representative, York Solicitors.

Submissions & Conclusions - Error of Law

    5. In the grounds of appeal drafted by Mr P Lewis  of  Counsel  for  the
       appellant on 1st January 2020 it is  argued,  in  brief  summary,  as
       follows. Firstly, that there was a failure to properly  consider  the
       psychiatric evidence which confirmed the  appellant  has  PTSD.  This
       diagnosis was accepted but the First-tier Tribunal did not deal  with
       the aspects of psychiatric evidence which supported  the  credibility
       of the appellant's delay in claiming asylum, which in turn was a  key
       reason for rejecting the credibility of the asylum  claim,  and  thus
       there was an error of law in failing to  look  at  material  evidence
       properly when assessing the credibility of the appellant.   Secondly,
       the First-tier Tribunal is argued to have erred in law  by  requiring
       corroborative evidence  of  the  appellant's  relationship  with  his
       contended LTTE member girl-friend and of the fact that he transferred
       funds to his girl-friend when these issues were not contested by  the
       respondent in the reasons for refusal letter and when they  were  not
       raised by Judge at the hearing in  the  context  of  it  having  been
       decided that the matter could justly  proceed  by  submissions  only.
       Further, it is argued, no sufficiently or properly reasoned regard is
       had to evidence which it  is  argued  did  corroborate  these  issues
       namely the letter from the appellant's father and the letter from the
       Sri Lankan registered lawyer.

    6. In the submissions of Mr C Bates, Specialist Appeals Team, dated 22nd
       May 2020 it is accepted that the First-tier Tribunal materially erred
       in  law  at  paragraphs  16-17  of  the  decision  in  assessing  the
       credibility of the claim based on an issue  of  delay  by  apparently
       drawing a distinction with regard to the impact  of  the  appellant's
       PTSD because its initial cause in 2007 was  unrelated  to  the  claim
       which is said to have arisen in 2014.  The  respondent  accepts  that
       someone  who  has  PTSD  may  have  this  retriggered  by  subsequent
       traumatic events, and that the appellant  was  accepted  as  being  a
       vulnerable witness to the extent that the appeal was to be dealt with
       by submissions only based on this evidence.

    7. It is also accepted that the respondent did not dispute the existence
       of the appellant's relationship with his girl-friend per se either in
       the reasons for refusal letter or at the hearing, and that  this  was
       not an issue  raised  at  the  hearing,   so  that  the  findings  at
       paragraph 18 of the decision were procedurally unfair.

    8. The First-tier Tribunal did not  attribute  weight  to  the  father's
       letter at paragraph 20 in part because of "other" credibility  issues
       so that finding is accepted as being potentially contaminated by  the
       material errors set out above.

    9. It is also accepted that rejecting the lawyer's evidence at paragraph
       20 of the decision on the basis that �2750 sent to the LTTE could not
       be seen as a vast amount by the Sri Lankan police  was  not  reasoned
       with reference to any objective evidence that this amount  would  not
       be termed vast by the police.

   10. I find that the decision and all of the findings  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal should be set aside for  the  reasons  put  forward  in  the
       grounds of appeal and articulated as accepted as material  errors  of
       law by Mr Bates for the respondent.   I find that the  matter  should
       be retained and remade in the Upper Tribunal.

  Decision:

    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  all  of  the
       findings.

    3. I adjourn the remaking of the appeal.

    original appellant, in the absence of any contrary instruction, by  use
    of any address apparent from the service of these directions.




    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the  appellant  from  the  contents  of  his
    protection claim.
