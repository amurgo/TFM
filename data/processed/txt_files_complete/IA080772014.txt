For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, born April 18, 1987, is a citizen of  Jamaica.  On  June
    24, 2012 the appellant entered the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor.  His
    intention was to make an application to join the  Royal  Navy.  By  the
    time his leave was due to expire he had not concluded the  process  and
    he therefore applied to vary  his  leave  on  December  12,  2012.  The
    respondent ultimately refused his application under paragraph 322(1) HC
    395 and took a decision to remove him under Section 47 (Removal: person
    with  statutorily  extended  leave)  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2002 on January 24, 2014.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal Section 82(1) of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (hereinafter  referred  to
    as the "2002 Act") on February 10, 2014 and on May 7, 2014 Judge of the
    First Tier Tribunal Wiseman (hereinafter referred  to  as  the  "FtTJ")
    heard his appeal and dismissed it in determination promulgated  on  May
    30, 2014.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on June 5, 2014 and on June  17,
    2014 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cruthers  granted  permission  to
    appeal finding it arguable the FtTJ had erred by not paying  sufficient
    attention to the position/interest of the appellant's son who was  born
    on November 15, 2013.

 4. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated July 3,  2014  requesting
    an oral hearing. She opposed the application and submitted the findings
    were sufficient and sustainable.

 5. The appellant and his solicitors were sent notice of today's hearing on
    July 10, 2014. The notice is deemed  served.  By  11.15am  neither  the
    appellant nor his representative had attended. I directed my  clerk  to
    make enquiries and at 11.35am I decided to  proceed  with  the  hearing
    because the solicitors had not responded to the message and  of  course
    the hearing was listed at 10am.

    SUBMISSIONS

 6. Mr Duffy submitted that there was no material error. It  was  important
    to note that the appellant could not meet the requirements of Section E-
    LTRPT of Appendix FM. This  section  sets  out  what  requirements  the
    appellant must meet to be granted limited leave to remain as the parent
    of a British child. The appellant could not satisfy these  requirements
    because he could not meet the requirements of Section E-LTRPT. The FtTJ
    did not err by not considering this application under the Rules.

 7. He further  submitted  the  appellant  was  also  unable  to  meet  the
    requirements of paragraph 276ADE HC 395 because he had only been here a
    short period and still had ties to Jamaica.

 8. The only area of challenge was whether this was a case that should have
    been considered outside of the Rules. The FtTJ had regard to  the  full
    facts and made findings open to him and that included having regard  to
    the fact the child was British and the principle that the child  should
    be with both parents.

 9. The FtTJ considered the child in paragraph [45] and took on  board  the
    respondent's submissions in paragraph [44] of the determination.

10. He rejected the appeal under the rules and in  paragraph  [46]  he  did
    consider the appeal in  line  with  the  advice  given  in  R  (on  the
    application of) Nagre v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan [2013]
    UKUT 00640 (IAC). There was no material error.

    FINDINGS

11. The appellant has lodged grounds of appeal that are somewhat confusing.
    In paragraph [1] of the grounds the  appellant  claimed  the  FtTJ  had
    erred because he had not  considered  the  appeal  under  the  relevant
    sections of paragraph 276ADE. He then went on to refer to his rights as
    a parent of a British child. These are different issues and  I  propose
    to treat them as such.

12. The FtTJ did consider the appeal under paragraph 276ADE as evidenced by
    his examination of the evidence in paragraph [46] of the determination.
    The appellant had only been here since June 2012 and the FtTJ found  he
    had not lost ties to Jamaica. He was over the age of 25  and  he  could
    only succeed under paragraph 276ADE (vi) but to do so he had to show he
    had no ties to Jamaica. The FtTJ reached a finding open to him.

13. The next issue raised in the grounds related to whether the FtTJ should
    have considered the application under Section E-LTRPT of  Appendix  FM.
    Whilst the appellant met the requirement Section E-LTRPT  2.2  and  2.4
    possibly 2.3 he was unable to satisfy 3.1 because he had  come  to  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor and that leave had been for six  months  or
    less. He also failed to provide evidence that he  was  able  to  comply
    with 4.1 or 4.2 in respect of  the  financial  requirements.  Paragraph
    EX.1 was not engaged.

14. Accordingly, whilst the FtTJ did not  consider  the  application  under
    this section there is no material error of law. I would also  add  that
    the appellant (who was legally represented before  the  FtTJ)  did  not
    seek to argue the contrary in any event.

15. The FtTJ was aware of all the factors and he did have regard  to  Nagre
    and Gulshan. In paragraph [46] he referred to these cases and went onto
    consider the appeal outside of the Rules. For the reason  contained  in
    the preceding paragraphs of his determination he found removal was  not
    disproportionate. This was a finding open to him.

16. I am satisfied there is no error in law.




    DECISION


17. There is no material error of law and I uphold the original decision.

18. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order has been made and no request for an order was submitted to me.
