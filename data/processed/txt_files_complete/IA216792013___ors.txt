Officer

Anonymity direction made.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellants are  four  citizens  of  Libya.   They  appeal  against  a
   determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge Ferguson,  promulgated  on  22
   November 2013, dismissing their appeals under the Immigration  Rules  and
   under reference to Article 8 of the ECHR; finding removal  decisions  not
   in accordance with the law; and declining to deal with claims made  under
   the Refugee Convention.


2) The judge overlooked that section 51(3) of the Crime &  Courts  Act  2013
   amended section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum & Nationality Act 2006 from
   8 May 2013 to the effect that removal decisions can be  made  along  with
   refusals of variation of leave to remain.  That was an error of law.

3) The appellants raised their  asylum  claim  by  way  of  a  statement  of
   additional grounds under section 120 of the 2002 Act, rather than by  the
   principal appellant presenting himself as an  asylum  applicant  for  the
   usual processing and interview (as the  respondent  suggested  he  should
   do).  They also chose to  have  their  cases  decided  "on  the  papers",
   without oral hearing.  The circumstances were somewhat unusual,  and  the
   judge thought that the First-tier Tribunal should not become  effectively
   the original decision maker.  However, the statutory ground of appeal  in
   terms of section 84(1)(g) that removal of the appellants would breach the
   UK's obligations under the Refugee Convention  was  properly  before  the
   First-tier Tribunal, and under section 86(2) the First-tier Tribunal  was
   obliged to determine it.  Not to do so was another error of law.

4) Further procedure is more problematic.  There is a good argument, as  the
   Presenting Officer observed, for  correcting  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
   error by  substituting  a  decision  based  upon  such  evidence  as  the
   appellants chose to  place  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   (If  the
   outcome were negative, the appellants might seek to proceed by way  of  a
   fresh claim, but that is presently beside the point.)

5) The appellants have put in written applications for admission of  various
   further evidence, if error of law were to be found and the case  remitted
   to the First-tier Tribunal.  By implication, that suggests that they  now
   seek an oral hearing there.    Mr  Gibb  confirmed  that  such  is  their
   preferred course.

6) Whether further evidence is admitted in the First-tier Tribunal  will  be
   a  matter  for  future  consideration  there,   although   broadly,   and
   pragmatically, it seems to me that there should  be  a  fresh  First-tier
   Tribunal decision based on all relevant evidence to date.

7) Mr Gibb accepted that if the case were to go to an oral  hearing  in  the
   First-tier Tribunal, it was for the appellants to resolve any question of
   payment of  an  additional  fee.   He  was  not  aware  of  the  relevant
   procedure.  Since the hearing, I have referred to the First-tier Tribunal
   (Immigration & Asylum Chamber) Fees Order 2011, article 3.  There appears
   to be an additional fee payable of ï¿½60.  It is the duty of the appellants
   to proceed immediately to enable their appeal to be determined through an
   oral hearing.

8) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal errs in  law,  as  found  at
   paragraphs 2 and 3 above.  It  is  set  aside  in  its  entirety.   Under
   section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and Practice Statement 7.2 the nature
   and extent of judicial fact finding necessary  for  the  decision  to  be
   remade is such that it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier
   Tribunal.  The members of the FtT chosen to reconsider the case  are  not
   to include Judge Ferguson.

9) Both parties sought time to prepare for the next hearing.  It was  agreed
   that this should not be listed for 8 weeks; that  no  further  directions
   were needed; and that an interpreter will not be required.

10) An anonymity order was  asked  for  at  the  hearing,  and  was  granted
   without objection by the respondent.  It is therefore directed  that  the
   appellants be granted anonymity throughout these proceedings  unless  and
   until a  court  or  tribunal  directs  otherwise.   No  report  of  these
   proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify the appellants  or  any
   member of their family.  This direction applies both to the appellant and
   to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead to a
   contempt of court. Whether such an order remains in force is a matter  to
   be addressed in the First-tier Tribunal (see  the  Presidential  Guidance
   Note No 2 of 2011).
