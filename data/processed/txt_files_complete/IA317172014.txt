Representation:
For the Appellant: Ms C Hulse instructed by A & A Solicitors
For the Respondents: Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The  appellant,  a  national  of  Nigeria,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
  Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 25  July  2014
  to refuse to grant her application for leave to remain in  the  UK  as  a
  domestic worker and to remove her from the UK.  First-tier Tribunal Judge
  Birrell  dismissed  the  appeal  and  the  appellant  now  appeals   with
  permission to this Tribunal.

2. The background to this appeal is that the appellant entered the UK  on  8
  October 2010 as a Domestic Worker in a private household.  Her  leave  to
  remain was extended on 23 July 2013 until 23 July 2014. According to  her
  witness statement the appellant changed employer on 1  August  2013.  She
  applied for a further extension of her leave to remain on 23  June  2014.
  The relevant paragraph of the Rules for the purposes of  this  appeal  is
  paragraph 159EA which provides;

      "159EA. The requirements for an extension of stay as a domestic worker
      in a private household for applicants who entered the  United  Kingdom
      under Rules in place before 6 April 2012 are that the applicant:

           i) last entered the  UK  with  a  valid  entry  clearance  as  a
              domestic worker in a private household under Rules  in  place
              before 6 April 2012; and

          ii) has continued to  be  employed  for  the  duration  of  leave
              granted as a domestic worker in a private household; and

         iii) continues to be required for employment for the period of the
              extension sought as a full time domestic worker in a  private
              household under the same roof as the employer or in the  same
              household that the employer has lived in and  where  evidence
              of this in the  form  of  written  terms  and  conditions  of
              employment in the UK as set out in Appendix  7  and  evidence
              that the employer resides in the UK; and

          iv) does not intend to take employment  except  as  a  full  time
              domestic worker in the private household referred to in  sub-
              paragraph 159EA (iii); and

           v) meets the requirements of paragraph 159A (i) and (vii); and

          vi) must not be in the UK in breach of  immigration  laws  except
              that any period of overstaying for a period  of  28  days  or
              less will be disregarded."

3. The  respondent  refused  the  application  under  paragraph  159EA  (iv)
  because the  appellant's  contract  of  employment  states  that  she  is
  employed to work for 3.5 hours per day which amounts to  17.5  hours  per
  week and is therefore part-time employment.

4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard oral evidence from the appellant  and
  from her employer. The appellant's evidence was that she  works  for  7.5
  hours a day and does additional work on Saturday and Sunday  as  required
  and that the salary in the contract of  �85  per  week  is  correct.  The
  appellant's employer gave evidence to the same effect and said  that  the
  3.5 hours on the contract was an error as she was under a lot  of  stress
  at the time she completed it. She too confirmed  that  the  appellant  is
  paid �85 per week. The First-tier Tribunal Judge also considered a letter
  from the employer to the Home Office dated 20 June 2014,  submitted  with
  the  application  to  demonstrate  compliance  with  Appendix  7  of  the
  Immigration Rules, which confirmed that the appellant is  being  paid  in
  accordance with the National Minimum Wage (NMW) Act 1988.

5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded  that  paragraph  159EA  required
  that the domestic worker is employed full-time and that she is  paid  the
  NMW. She went on to find that  the  she  accepted  the  appellant's  oral
  evidence that she works full-time for �85 per week which  equates  to  an
  hourly rate of �2.20 per hour which is less that the  NMW  of  �6.50  per
  hour. The Judge rejected the submission that the appellant was treated as
  a family member and was therefore exempt from payment of the NMW  because
  Appendix 7 specifically requires the payment of the NMW and the  employer
  had confirmed that this was  the  case.  The  Judge  concluded  that  the
  appellant could not therefore meet the requirements of paragraph 159EA.

6. At the outset of the hearing before me Ms  Hulse  sought  to  argue  that
  there had been some unfairness in the conduct of the hearing in the First-
  tier Tribunal and that she  had  a  witness  statement  prepared  by  the
  representatives who appeared in the First-tier Tribunal. However no  such
  allegation was made in the grounds of appeal and no notice was  given  of
  any intention to amend the grounds or as to the evidence to be relied  on
  to support the allegation of unfairness in accordance with  the  Tribunal
  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Immigration  Rules  2008.  The   procedures
  outlined  by  the  Tribunal  in  BW  (witness  statements  by  advocates)
  Afghanistan [2014] UKUT 00568 (IAC) were not followed by the appellant in
  this case. Accordingly I refused to permit the amendment of  the  grounds
  of appeal to include any allegation of unfairness.

Error of Law

7. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal contend that  the  First-tier
  Tribunal Judge erred in two respects. It is firstly  contended  that  the
  First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision was procedurally unfair in that  she
  dismissed the appeal on the basis that the appellant  did  not  meet  the
  requirement to be paid the minimum wage when this issue was not raised in
  the Reasons for Refusal letter. It is established law that the  appellant
  can only win an appeal by meeting all the requirements of the Immigration
  Rules whether or not they have been specified in the Reasons for  Refusal
  letter (Kwok On Tong [1981] Imm AR 214). Paragraph 159EA (iii) refers  to
  the terms and conditions set out in Appendix 7. Appendix 7 sets out  that
  in signing the statement of terms and conditions of employment set out in
  the Appendix 'the employer is declaring that the employee will be paid in
  accordance with the National Minimum Wage Act 1998  and  any  Regulations
  made under it for the duration of the employment.' The employer  in  this
  case did so declare in the letter to the respondent in June 2014.

8. It is contended in the grounds of appeal that  the  issue  of  compliance
  with the NMW requirements was not raised at the hearing in the First-tier
  Tribunal Judge. However this conflicts with paragraph 4 of the grounds of
  appeal where it is stated that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  raised  the
  issue of compliance with the NMW at the hearing. It is clear from reading
  the determination that the issue of the NMW was very much in issue at the
  hearing.  Paragraph  25  records  that  the  appellant's   representative
  submitted that as the appellant was treated as a family  member  the  NMW
  did not apply.

9. Accordingly I do not accept that the Judge made  a  procedural  error  in
  considering whether the appellant was being paid the NMW.

10. The grounds of appeal  further  contend  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
  Judge erred in failing to place sufficient weight on the evidence  before
  her that the appellant was exempt from the NMW criteria because she lives
  with her employer and is treated as a family member. Reliance  is  placed
  on the UKBA Immigration  Directorate  Instruction  Guidance  on  Domestic
  Workers in Private Households (IDIs) which states that  domestic  workers
  shall be paid the NMW unless an exemption applies. The grounds of  appeal
  assert that the IDIs were before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.   However
  at the hearing before me Ms Hulse  said  that  she  had  been  under  the
  impression that the IDIs were before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  but
  she now accepted that they had  not.  In  fact  the  First-tier  Tribunal
  appellant's bundle contains a print out from Gov.UK in  relation  to  the
  minimum wage but no IDIs. The grounds of appeal are therefore misleading.



11. Ms Hulse submitted that the Judge should have considered the  IDIs  even
  thought they were not before her. I do not accept  this  submission.  The
  Judge could only make the decision on the basis of  the  evidence  before
  her. On the evidence before her the Judge was entitled to  conclude  that
  the appellant could not be exempt from the NMW  when  the  provision  she
  applied under specifically required that she is paid the NMW [32].

12. Even if the Judge had the IDIs I do not accept that the extract set  out
  in the grounds meant that the appellant should have  been  considered  as
  exempt from the NMW. The extract indicates that a domestic worker may  be
  exempt from the NMW if they are treated as a  member  of  the  employer's
  family including sharing in the  tasks  and  leisure  activities  of  the
  family and having meals and accommodation provided free and  as  if  they
  were a member of the employer's family. In this case  however  the  Judge
  found that the  appellant  naively  and  misguidedly  believed  that  the
  employer had treated her fairly when in fact her employer  had  exploited
  her trust [31]. The Judge was clearly aware of the evidence  put  forward
  by the appellant and her employer as to  their  relationship.  Given  her
  finding at paragraph 31 it is difficult to see how the Judge  could  have
  concluded on the evidence before her that the appellant, who  worked  for
  her employer full time and undertook extra work at the weekends including
  babysitting, was being treated as a member of her employer's family.

13. The findings made by the First-tier Tribunal Judge were open to  her  on
  the evidence before her and I am therefore satisfied that the decision of
  the First-tier Tribunal Judge does not contain a material error of law.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
