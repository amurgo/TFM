                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Ms J Heybroek, instructed by Eagle Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Toan Cong Vu, date of  birth  9.2.76,  is  a  citizen  of
    Vietnam.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingham promulgated 8.10.14, allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 23.8.13 to refuse leave to remain on human rights grounds and  to
    remove the claimant from the United Kingdom under  section  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999.   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    18.9.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Parkes  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    24.11.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 7.1.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.
Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Lingham should be set aside.

 6. In a lengthy decision Judge Lingham found that the  claimant  met  both
    the parent and partner route under Appendix FM. The judge then went  on
    to find in the alternative that the  claimant  had  established  family
    life with his partner and  child  in  the  UK  and  that  it  would  be
    disproportionate to remove him, having regard to the  position  of  his
    partner's son.

 7. In essence, the grounds argue that the judge appears  to  have  treated
    EX1 as a free-standing provision. It is asserted that the judge  failed
    to properly take into account that family  life  had  been  established
    when the claimant  was  in  the  UK  illegally  and  the  circumstances
    identified could not be said to be insurmountable.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Parkes stated simply  that  the
    grounds are clearly arguable.

 9. At �54 the judge noted that the Secretary of State relied on S-LTR 1.6,
    to the effect that the presence of  the  claimant  in  the  UK  is  not
    conducive  to  the  public  good  because,  "their  conduct  (including
    convictions which do not fall within para  S-LTR  1.3-1.5),  character,
    associations or other reasons, make it undesirable  to  allow  them  to
    remain in the UK."

10. The claimant's Rule 24 response,  dated  9.12.14,  maintains  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge was correct in law to reject the reliance  of
    the Secretary of State on S-LTR 1.6 and then proceed to  consider  EX1,
    as it had not been proven that it was conducive to the public  good  to
    refuse the application. However, it is clear from �53, �57 and  �60  of
    the decision that Ms Heybroek, who  represented  the  claimant  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing, did not advance  this  argument  in
    the First-tier Tribunal. At �57 the judge specifically stated  that  in
    respect of S-LTR 1.6 Ms Heybroek  "did  not  make  any  submissions  in
    support of the appellant. Indeed the appellant accepts that he had over
    stayed following the end of his 2005 visa  and  he  had  not  tried  to
    regularise his stay until after his arrest in August 2013," when he was
    encountered working illegally.

11. Further, as it is clear from �60 that  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    claimant failed to meet S-LTR 1.6, it ill-becomes Ms Heybroek to assert
    in a disingenuous submission, including at �12 of her Rule 24 response,
    and almost entirely  revisionary  of  the  content  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision, that the judge had rejected the Secretary of State's
    reliance on S-LTR 1.6. To the contrary, it  is  clear  that  the  judge
    proceeded from the position that S-LTR 1.6 had been satisfied.  Whether
    she was right to so conclude is not in fact in issue in this appeal, as
    that part of the decision has not been appealed. However, the statement
    at �60 of  the  decision  that  the  judge  went  on  to  consider  the
    claimant's family life in the UK "on the basis that although  he  fails
    to meet S-LTR 1.6 he can meet E-LTRT 2.2  because  it  stipulates  that
    "The applicant must not be in the UK in  breach  of  immigration  rules
    (disregarding any period of overstaying for a  period  of  28  days  or
    less), unless paragraph  EX.1  applies,"  was  wrong  in  law.  If  the
    claimant cannot meet S-LTR 1.6 he fails at that preliminary hurdle  and
    cannot reach the stage of consideration of E-LTRT 2.2 or EX.1. When the
    terms of the decision in relation to S-LTR 1.6 were put to Ms Heybroek,
    she eventually conceded that it had not been challenged at  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

12. It follows that the judge cannot in law have been satisfied that as the
    claimant has shown a genuine relationship with Ms Bui,  paragraph  EX.1
    applies to him, as the judge purported to find  at  the  conclusion  of
    �60.

13. I also note that the refusal decision relied not only on S-LTR 1.6  but
    also S-LTR 1.7, as  the  claimant  failed  to  provide  an  immigration
    officer with his address during questioning. In respect  of  this,  the
    judge found that the claimant had offered a reasonable explanation  for
    not offering an address in Aberdeen.  However, the judge makes no  such
    similar finding in relation to S-LTR 1.7.

14. It follows from the above that the findings of the judge in relation to
    Appendix FM are fundamentally flawed and cannot stand. EX.1 is not free-
    standing, as has been made clear in Sabir (Appendix  FM  EX1  not  free
    standing) [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC). The  discussion  and  findings  that
    follow from �60 through to �69 are wrong in  law.  Since  the  claimant
    failed at the stage of S-LTR 1.6 none of the  EX.1  considerations  are
    relevant.

15. I note in passing that at �66 the judge refers to two parts of  R-LTRP,
    when it appears she is in fact referring to EX.1. Further,  it  is  not
    clear from �67 that the judge intends to refer to E-LTRP 3.2, as I  can
    find no reference to that provision in the refusal decision.

16. At �69 the judge appears to  have  considered  that  the  claimant  may
    succeed under the parent route, before going on to find that even if he
    does not, he can succeed under the partner route. This finding is  also
    fundamentally flawed. It is not possible for the claimant  to  meet  E-
    LTRPT 2.3 or 2.4 where the child concerned lives with their mother  and
    the claimant. The claimant has  to  show  sole  responsibility  or  the
    parent or carer with whom the child lives must not be  the  partner  of
    the claimant. In effect, leave to remain under the parent route has  no
    application to the facts of this case.

17. Given that the findings in relation  to  Appendix  FM  are  flawed  and
    cannot stand, they necessarily infect the article 8 ECHR  consideration
    outside the Rules, as the fact that a person cannot meet  the  relevant
    Rules for consideration of private and family life is  highly  relevant
    to any proportionality balancing exercise.

18. Further, in relation to the article 8 assessment,  although  the  judge
    recites, somewhat incorrectly, some of the provisions of section  117B,
    it is not clear that the judge has in fact taken account of  them.  For
    example, it is not clear whether the judge has accorded  little  weight
    to the claimant's relationship with his partner, established at a  time
    when he was in the UK unlawfully. Neither has the judge  addressed  the
    issue of reasonableness of expecting his  partner  to  relocate,  given
    that she was fully aware of his precarious immigration status and  that
    they may not be able to continue such a relationship in the UK. She has
    spent at least part of her life in Vietnam and would be returning  with
    the claimant who still has ties to Vietnam. There was no evidence  that
    she had made any enquiries as to whether she would be  able  to  remain
    there with him, or whether she  might  be  able  to  obtain  employment
    there. In the absence of these considerations, I find  that  there  has
    been an insufficient assessment  of  the  obstacles  to  relocation  of
    family life in Vietnam. Most of the discussion in the decision from �83
    onwards relates to the child Daniel. In the circumstances, the  article
    8 assessment is incomplete and inadequate.

19. For the reasons set out the decision of the First-tier Tribunal has  to
    be set aside and remade. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has
    been set aside, section 12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and  Enforcement
    Act 2007 requires either that the case is remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal with directions, or it must be remade by the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The scheme of the Tribunals Court and Enforcement  Act  2007  does  not
    assign the function of primary fact  finding  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.
    Where the findings are unclear on a crucial issue at the  heart  of  an
    appeal, as they are in this case, effectively  there  has  not  been  a
    valid determination of those  issues.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions  from
    those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of  the
    issues in the appeal.

20. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and  that
    the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding  which  is  necessary
    for the decision in the appeal to  be  re-made  is  such  that,  having
    regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with cases  fairly
    and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.
Conclusion & Decision:

21. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

     I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade afresh.

Consequential Directions

22. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor  House,  to
    be heard by any First-tier Tribunal Judge other than Judge Lingam;

23. The appeal is to be heard afresh with no findings of fact preserved;

24. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
