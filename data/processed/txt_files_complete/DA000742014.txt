For the Appellant:     In person
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Iran  born  on  31st  August  1987.   His
    appeal against the Respondent's decision to make  a  deportation  order
    under Section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 was dismissed by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Bartlett under the Immigration  Rules  but  allowed
    under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights on the basis
    that the Appellant should be granted limited leave to remain in the  UK
    pending the completion of the Hague Convention proceedings.

2.   The Secretary of State applied for permission  to  appeal  the  judge's
    decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds. This was granted  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson on 14th July 2015. The Appellant  was
    granted permission to appeal the decision to  dismiss  his  deportation
    appeal under the Immigration Rules by  designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge McClure on 31st July 2015.



Error of law

3.   The appeal came before Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun on 5th May 2016.  She
    found that there was an error of law  for  the  reasons  given  in  her
    decision dated 26th May 2016.  She noted that the First-tier Judge  had
    evidently reached his decision on a mistaken factual basis. There  were
    no Hague Convention proceedings imminent. The Appellant's son [child A]
    was with his mother [JZ] in Israel. The  mother  intended  to  stay  in
    Israel with child A permanently. The issue was  in  the  hands  of  the
    Israeli authorities who were awaiting a decision on legal aid from  the
    UK authorities.

4.   Judge Eshun found that the First-tier Tribunal judge had erred  in  law
    in his approach to the  deportation  decision  by  treating  the  Hague
    Convention proceedings as a freestanding issue rather than  approaching
    it in the structured way prescribed by the  UK  Borders  Act  2007  and
    paragraphs 398 to 399A of the Immigration Rules.  She also  found  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had reached  a  decision  on  this  issue
    which was inconsistent with his decision relating  to  a  second  child
    [child B] of the Appellant  by  another  mother  [LC].  The  First-tier
    Tribunal judge held that it was in the best interests  of  child  B  to
    stay with his mother, LC.

5.   Having reached those conclusions Judge Eshun set aside the decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal for it to be remade by the Upper  Tribunal  and
    she  adjourned  the  hearing  of  the  appeal  for  two  reasons.   The
    representatives required more time to research the Hague Convention and
    its consequences for the Appellant and child A and  the  Appellant  had
    again been convicted  for  possession  of  cannabis  and  was  awaiting
    sentence.



Adjournment applications

6.   The appeal came before  Mr  Justice  Warby  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Rimington on 5th July 2016. The Appellant did not  attend  the  hearing
    and was not represented.  The night before the hearing the  Appellant's
    solicitors had emailed the court with a letter of their own seeking  an
    adjournment and a brief medical report from a consultant  psychiatrist.
    The letter sought an adjournment on the grounds that the solicitors had
    not prepared for  the  hearing  and  were  no  longer  instructed.  The
    Appellant himself was not well enough to appear.  The  Home  Office  at
    that hearing, represented by Mr Tufan, did not resist the  adjournment.



7.   Warby  J  was  of  the  view  that  there  could  not  in  fairness  or
    practicality be an effective, substantive resumed hearing so the matter
    was adjourned. However, he made it clear that the reasons advanced  for
    the adjournment were far from impressive. No account was given  of  the
    extent to which, if any, the Appellant's solicitors had taken steps  to
    address the outstanding issues,  no  explanation  was  offered  of  the
    cessation of the solicitor's  instructions  and  more  importantly  the
    evidence fell far short  of  what  would  be  required  to  justify  an
    adjournment on medical grounds. The Upper Tribunal adjourned the appeal
    and gave directions and the matter came before me on 24th October 2016.

8.   At this hearing before me the Appellant applied for an  adjournment  on
    the basis that he did not have legal representation and was waiting for
    a decision on legal aid. He confirmed that he had received  the  notice
    of hearing in respect of today's appeal hearing on  31st  August  2016.
    He had then gone to the Citizens Advice Bureau and had been  trying  to
    find solicitors to apply for legal aid.  He had contacted Solomon's  in
    Norwich who were in the process of applying for legal aid and had  told
    him to go to court and  ask  for  an  adjournment.  He  first  went  to
    Solomon's in Norwich a couple of days before 4th October 2016. Prior to
    that on 26th June 2016 he had spoken to Duncan Lewis, they  were  still
    waiting for some Home Office documents to arrive.   He  had  not  heard
    anything from them and had therefore gone  to  alternative  solicitors.
    Solomon's in Norwich had done an assessment but had not got legal aid.

9.   I refused the adjournment on the  basis  that  the  appellant  had  had
    ample time to instruct legal representatives. At  the  hearing  on  5th
    July 2006 before Warby J his previous  solicitors  had  indicated  that
    they were no longer instructed and the appeal  was  adjourned  to  24th
    October 2016. The Appellant was therefore well aware from 5th July 2016
    that he did not have representatives. He was aware on 31st August  2016
    that the new hearing date would be 24th October 2016. He has had  ample
    time to instruct solicitors and obtain legal aid, if  he  was  in  fact
    able to get it. Accordingly, having regard to the overriding objective,
    I refused the adjournment.

10.  The Appellant also sought an adjournment on the  grounds  that  he  was
    suffering from depression and had mental health issues and did not feel
    that he could properly represent himself.  For  the  reasons  given  by
    Warby J, in his decision dated 7th July 2016, the medical evidence fell
    far short of what would be  required  to  justify  an  adjournment  and
    accordingly I was not minded to adjourn the  appeal  on  those  grounds
    either.



Preliminary issues

11.  The Appellant confirmed at the outset of  the  hearing  that  he  would
    like to give his evidence and present his case in English, although  an
    interpreter was present in court in case he  got  into  difficulty.  He
    confirmed he understood the  interpreter,  but  he  did  not  need  the
    services of the interpreter and answered questions in English  and  put
    forward submissions on his own behalf.

12.  There was some discussion as to whether Upper Tribunal Judge Eshun  had
    preserved any of the Article 8 findings of the First-tier Tribunal. She
    concluded that the judge's failure to  consider  the  circumstances  of
    child A and the Hague Convention proceedings within the  prism  of  the
    Immigration Rules amounted to an error of law. Also  that  the  judge's
    decision in respect of the Appellant and the second child, child B, had
    created an inconsistency in his decision in respect  of  child  A.  For
    these reasons the judge's decision could not stand and it was set aside
    in order for it to be re-made by the Upper Tribunal. It would appear on
    that basis that none of  the  Article  8  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were preserved and therefore it was for me to determine  these
    issues afresh, as at the date of hearing.

13.  The Appellant relied on his witness  statement  which  was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal dated 30th July 2014 and which had been  signed  by
    him. I read the  statement  to  the  Appellant  and  he  confirmed  its
    accuracy.  He did however dispute paragraph 4 of his witness  statement
    which states "I have been advised not to pursue the asylum claim and  I
    accept that advice. I cannot remember much of  what  happened  in  Iran
    since I lost my memory." He claimed that he had  only  agreed  to  that
    course of action because he was concerned about bringing child  A,  his
    eldest son, back to the UK. That was the most important  issue  at  the
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal and that is why he had agreed  to
    that course, but he still wished to pursue his asylum claim.

14.  The First-tier Tribunal judge,  at  paragraph  20,  noted  the  written
    statement in which the Appellant stated that he was  not  pursuing  any
    asylum claim. He also noted that it  was  specifically  stated  by  the
    Appellant's legal representative and by the Appellant in evidence  that
    an asylum claim was no longer being pursued. There was no challenge, in
    the Appellant's grounds of appeal for permission to appeal to the Upper
    Tribunal, to that finding by the judge on the basis of the  concessions
    made by the Appellant and his representative at the time. The Appellant
    has had ample opportunity to dispute that point and has not done so. It
    was not raised in the grounds and therefore was not dealt with  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in finding an error of law. In any event, the  Appellant
    claimed that he cannot remember much of what happened in Iran since  he
    lost his memory.

15.  The Appellant quite clearly confirmed in his statement and  before  the
    judge that he was not pursuing an asylum claim and had  not  sought  to
    raise such an issue at any time over the past year, the decision having
    been promulgated on 25th June 2015. There was no error of  law  in  the
    judge's finding that the Appellant was no longer  pursuing  his  asylum
    claim and therefore no reason to deal with that issue in  this  appeal,
    given that permission to appeal was not applied  for,  or  granted,  on
    that ground. Accordingly, I did not hear evidence or submissions on the
    Appellant's asylum claim.



The Appellant's immigration history

16.  The Appellant's  immigration  history  is  as  follows.  The  Appellant
    claims to have arrived clandestinely in the UK on 10th May 2004  hidden
    in a lorry. He claimed asylum on 19th May 2004. On 23rd June  2004  his
    asylum interview was conducted and his claim was refused on  12th  July
    2004.  On 13th July 2004 he was served with notice IS151A as an illegal
    entrant. On 27th July 2004 the Appellant lodged an appeal  against  the
    decision to refuse his asylum claim. On 24th October 2004 the Appellant
    was granted discretionary leave valid until 30th August 2005.  On  29th
    November 2004 his appeal against the  decision  to  refuse  his  asylum
    claim was abandoned following his grant of discretionary leave. On 26th
    August 2005 the  Appellant  applied  for  further  leave,  humanitarian
    protection, discretionary leave or exceptional leave to  remain.   This
    application was withdrawn on 21st February 2012.

17.  On 23rd July 2013 a liability for deportation notice and  questionnaire
    was sent to the Appellant for completion. A telephone call was received
    on 9th August 2013 from a third party, ER, requesting an  extension  to
    the twenty day deadline for response.  As no response was  received  by
    18th September 2013 a letter  was  sent  granting  a  further  ten  day
    extension to complete the questionnaire. On 18th October 2013 a further
    telephone call was received from ER asking for further time to  respond
    as the Appellant was in the process of instructing representatives  and
    gathering supporting evidence. This  was  agreed  and  a  response  was
    requested by 6th November 2013.

18.  On 1st November  2013  a  letter  was  received  from  Stepstone  Visas
    stating that they were now representing the Appellant and would forward
    further representations in due course. On 12th November 2013  Stepstone
    Visas forwarded a completed liability for deportation questionnaire.  A
    fear of return was raised on the basis of Article 3 of the  ECHR  which
    had been accepted as further representations  on  his  original  asylum
    claim. Article 8 family and  private  life  representations  were  also
    raised with the Respondents and it was claimed that the Appellant had a
    right of residence under Zambrano case law on the basis that he  had  a
    British child in the UK.



The Appellant's previous convictions

19.  On 18th December 2007 the Appellant was convicted  at  Northwest  Essex
    Magistrates' Court of three offences, driving otherwise  in  accordance
    with a licence, using a vehicle  whilst  uninsured,  and  exceeding  70
    miles per hour on a motorway. He was sentenced to a fine  of  �200  and
    eight penalty points on his licence.

20.  On 7th August 2008 the  Appellant  was  convicted  at  Cambridge  Crown
    Court of  using  a  vehicle  whilst  uninsured,  driving  otherwise  in
    accordance with a licence, and dangerous driving. He was  sentenced  to
    six months' imprisonment wholly suspended for eighteen months with a 30
    day activity requirement. He was disqualified from driving  for  twelve
    months and required to retake his driving test.

21.  On 7th August 2008 the  Appellant  was  convicted  at  Cambridge  Crown
    Court of possessing  a  class  A  controlled  drug,  cocaine,  and  was
    sentenced to three months' imprisonment wholly suspended  for  eighteen
    months.

22.  On 9th July 2009 the Appellant was convicted at Cambridge  Magistrates'
    Court of driving whilst disqualified, failing to provide a specimen for
    analysis, using a vehicle whilst uninsured and failing to  comply  with
    community requirements of a suspended sentence order from his  original
    conviction on 7th  August  2008.  The  Appellant  was  sentenced  to  a
    community order of twelve  months,  disqualified  from  driving  for  a
    further twelve months and his driving test was to be retaken.

23.  On 11th April 2012 the Appellant was convicted at Ipswich  Crown  Court
    of possession  with  intent  to  supply  a  class  B  controlled  drug,
    cannabis,  facilitating  the   acquisition   /acquiring/possession   of
    criminal property and driving a mechanically propelled vehicle  without
    due care and attention.  On 8th  November  2012  he  was  sentenced  to
    twelve months'  imprisonment  for  possession  with  intent  to  supply
    cannabis  and  four  months'  imprisonment  for  facilitating  criminal
    property.  His four month sentence was to run concurrent to his  twelve
    month sentence.  The Appellant was also sentenced to a fine of �600,  a
    victim surcharge of �15 and his licence was endorsed. He  was  released
    from prison in Norwich on the same  date  as  he  had  served  time  on
    remand.

24.  On 17th June  2016  he  was  convicted  at  Cambridge  Crown  Court  of
    possession with intent to supply a controlled drug, class B cannabis on
    6th June 2015. He received twelve months' imprisonment suspended wholly
    for twelve months, a  rehabilitation  activity  requirement,  a  mental
    health requirement for twelve months for non-residential mental  health
    treatment and a victim surcharge of �100 and forfeiture and destruction
    of the drugs.



The Appellant's evidence

25.  In relation  to  the  witness  statement  dated  30th  July  2014,  the
    Appellant confirmed that he no longer lived with his business  partner,
    Russell Reed [RR], but had moved in with his partner Lianna Calver [LC]
    in a village near Cambridge and  he  had  been  living  with  LC  since
    September 2015.  Save for those corrections the Appellant relied on his
    statement as his evidence-in-chief.

26.  The Appellant also relied  on  a  handwritten  supplementary  statement
    which is dated 9th June 2015 and was before First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Bartlett. In that statement he claimed to have instructed solicitors to
    assist him in the return of his son child A. His son child B  was  born
    on 18th September 2014. On 17th March 2015  he  made  full  payment  in
    respect of  the  confiscation  order.   The  Appellant  relied  on  the
    contents of that statement in this appeal.

27.  There were also two statements from LC, one dated 30th July 2014 and  a
    supplementary statement dated 9th June 2015, a statement from RR  dated
    July 2014 and a statement from Francine Calver  [FC]  dated  30th  July
    2014.

28.  In examination-in-chief the Appellant confirmed that  he  had  been  on
    antidepressants and other medications since 2006  when  he  received  a
    head injury. His medication kept changing because they were  trying  to
    find the right one. He also stated that he was aware from social  media
    that his first partner, JZ, and his eldest son, child A, were  probably
    back in the UK.  He suspected that they had gone to live in  Luton  and
    he had contacted the police who said they would put surveillance on the
    house to see if it was true. He had spoken to a family lawyer, JN,  who
    was different to the original lawyers whom he had instructed in respect
    of the Hague Convention. He had spoken to JN over the  telephone  about
    issuing proceedings in the UK to prevent his child from  being  removed
    from the UK in future. He stated  that  a  month  and  a  half  ago  he
    received a call from the mother of child A asking if she would get into
    trouble if she returned to the UK.

29.  The Appellant confirmed that he had been convicted for another  matter,
    namely, possession with intent to supply  cannabis  for  which  he  had
    received a sentence of twelve months' imprisonment suspended for twelve
    months. He stated that he had to see probation and he had been put on a
    mental health programme where he saw the Cambridge Mental  Health  Team
    every Thursday at 1 o'clock. He produced an email stating that  he  was
    to receive twelve sessions of cognitive behavioural therapy. He  stated
    that he had also contacted Cambridge  Mind  where  there  were  another
    twelve sessions and social workers were coming to the house  every  two
    weeks.

30.  The Appellant's previous convictions showed  an  impending  prosecution
    for using threatening, abusive and insulting words or  behaviour  under
    the Public Order Act.  When  I  asked  him  about  this  conviction  he
    produced a letter which stated that he was  found  not  guilty  by  the
    magistrates' court.  The Appellant stated that he thought his son child
    A was back in the UK and  he  was  going  to  go  to  court  to  get  a
    restriction on him so that he could not leave.

31.  In cross-examination he was asked why he  was  convicted  again  for  a
    drugs offence.  He stated that he was  again  pressured  by  Paddy  who
    thought that he had money because he had paid the  confiscation  order.
    He was now on a programme which would help him to stand up for  himself
    and would not allow other people to control his life. He was asked  how
    Paddy was able to find him four years later, he  stated  that  everyone
    knew Paddy in Cambridge even the police. He had  moved  house  so  that
    Paddy could not get hold of him.  He and his partner  had  moved  to  a
    village outside Cambridge. He did not associate with anyone anymore and
    that is why he had moved.  He  was  not  in  possession  of  drugs  for
    personal use.

32.  His son, child B, was 2 years and 3 months old.   His  partner  was  on
    benefits because she had breast cancer and it had moved into her  head.
    She was told she could not have a child and when she found out she  was
    pregnant it was a miracle. She was going through chemotherapy  and  her
    brother died and because of the medication and depression she could not
    work. She was getting counselling and seeing the  mental  health  team.
    Both of them were raising child B and  bringing  him  up.  LC's  mother
    helped out a lot and did food shopping and sometimes took them  to  the
    zoo.  LC's mother was a very supportive person.

33.  His son, child B, had his name down for nursery but the  funding  would
    not come through until January. At the moment he went every  Friday  to
    nursery but in January he would start to go a few days a week. Child  B
    went to play group on Wednesdays and now  and  again  went  to  another
    group on payment of a pound.

34.  The Appellant was not in contact with his mother in Iran.  He  did  not
    talk to his family at the moment.  It was high risk and there was a lot
    of pressure and he did not want to carry on so he did not want to speak
    to his family.  However, LC and child B had spoken to his  mother.  His
    mother had not helped him to pay the confiscation order,  but  she  did
    send his inheritance from  the  death  of  his  father  through  Hawala
    Banking and he had only had to pay half the amount because the  country
    was sanctioned. The Appellant's mother  lived  in  Shiraz  in  her  own
    house. He did not talk to his mother because the government were asking
    about him and taking her to the security services and torturing her. He
    had been advised that the important issue was to get his son, child  A,
    back from Israel and not to pursue his asylum claim.

35.  The Appellant confirmed that cognitive behavioural therapy was part  of
    his sentence and that because he had mental health problems  the  judge
    had made this order. The judge had ordered a psychiatric assessment and
    he advised treatment. The Appellant went  along  to  the  local  mental
    health team who took the assessment to the judge  and  said  he  needed
    help and so he was put on a course. He had been diagnosed with PTSD  in
    2009 as a result of the head injury he received in 2006.

36.  I asked the Appellant what activities he did with his son, child B.  He
    said he took him to the park, but he was not confident and  was  trying
    to work on his mental health so that he did not feel anxiety.   He  was
    really depressed and was doing better now.  He had been taking child  B
    to the park with his partner and they had got a few chickens and a  big
    play area. They would take him to the park and play group. He would  go
    with LC to play group as there were lots of people about, but he  would
    go to the park on his own with child B. If there were too  many  people
    around he would have to have someone with him.



Respondent's Submissions

37.  Mr Kotas submitted that the Appellant has  a  mother  in  Iran  and  so
    there were no significant obstacles to integration. The  Appellant  had
    two children. He currently  did  not  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with child A. There had been infrequent telephone
    contact with child A since he went to  Israel.  Even  if  there  was  a
    genuine  and  subsisting   parental   relationship,   the   Appellant's
    deportation would not be unduly harsh.

38.  Mr Kotas accepted that there was a genuine and subsisting  relationship
    with child B, but submitted that it would not be unduly harsh  for  the
    child to remain in the UK without the  Appellant  (MM  (Uganda)  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 450). It was a balancing exercise and all circumstances had to
    be taken into account including the  Appellant's  offending  behaviour.
    Child  B  was  still  very  young.  The  Appellant  had  commenced  his
    relationship with his partner LC after he was served with a deportation
    order and therefore his status in the UK was precarious.  Following  SS
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550, in automatic deportation  cases  only  a
    very strong claim could override the public interest.

39.  The Appellant had committed a drugs offence.  The  judge  had  accepted
    the Appellant's evidence of pressure, but since then there had  been  a
    further conviction for drugs. Mr Kotas submitted that he did not accept
    the Appellant was  pressured  into  anything  and  that  there  was  no
    evidence of that.  Knowing  that  he  was  liable  to  deportation  the
    Appellant had chosen to commit a further  criminal  act.  There  was  a
    strong public interest in deportation and it would not be unduly  harsh
    for his children to remain here with their mothers and the Appellant to
    be deported to Iran.

40.  The Appellant could not satisfy the exceptions  in  399  and  399A  and
    therefore would have to show very  compelling  circumstances  over  and
    above those exceptions.  His mental health problems did not come  close
    to Article 3 or 8.   His  mother  was  in  Iran  and  he  could  obtain
    treatment there.  Even if there was something compelling it had  to  be
    weighed against the public interest. Mr Kotas invited me to dismiss the
    appeal.



Appellant's Submissions

41.  The Appellant submitted that although his mother was  in  Iran  he  had
    been in the UK since the age of 17. He was a child  and  did  not  know
    anything and came here as his life  was  in  danger.  His  family  were
    involved with freedom fighters and lots of his family had  been  killed
    by the government. In 2006 he received a head injury. Since then he had
    not been a good person and he had  been  on  medication  and  suffering
    until now.  He had lost his memory.  He did  not  know  anything  about
    life back home in Iran or anybody. He did not even speak the  language.
    He was fine when he came here but since he received the injury  outside
    the police station he had not been well.  He could not return  to  Iran
    because they would want to make an example out of him.

42.  The Appellant had a great relationship with his eldest  son,  child  A,
    but his partner would not let the Appellant see him. The only time  she
    got in touch with the Appellant was for money and then  she  would  let
    him speak for one minute with his son and then hang up.  If he went  to
    Iran he would not be around for child B to visit him and child B  would
    have no opportunity to come and see him. His relationship with  LC  was
    not false. He knew her, she had cancer which they went through together
    and she had supported him. When she became pregnant she had to stop the
    cancer treatment and fortunately the cancer went away.

43.  The Appellant had  help  with  mental  health.   If  he  had  had  such
    treatment earlier he would not be in  this  situation.   He  was  under
    pressure to do something, but he had no family back home and could  not
    remember them. Before the injury in 2006 he could stand up for himself,
    but now he was bullied all because  of  his  head  injury.  He  was  on
    medication and could not work. He was tired and had  lots  of  problems
    and if he went to Iran he could not get medication and  could  not  see
    his family here in the UK.  He did not remember his family in Iran.



Factual Findings

44.  The Appellant started a relationship with JZ in 2007 and  it  ended  in
    about 2010. Child A was born on 29th  March  2010.  JZ  was  making  it
    difficult for the Appellant to see his son, child A. JZ had taken child
    A to Israel seven weeks before the First-tier Tribunal hearing on  30th
    July 2014. Prior to June 2014 the Appellant had a supportive and loving
    relationship with child A who had stayed with the Appellant at the home
    of his business partner RR on numerous occasions  and  had  stayed  for
    several times a week if not more. The Appellant had continued  to  have
    Skype conversations with child A when he was out of  the  country.  The
    Appellant was actively participating in child A's upbringing  up  until
    he went to Israel in June 2014. Since then the Appellant has had  Skype
    or telephone contact when he has sent money to his previous partner and
    she has allowed him a brief conversation with child A.  He thought that
    JZ had recently returned to the UK with child A, but he  had  not  seen
    them or been able to make contact with them.

45.  In May 2013 after release from prison, the Appellant met  LC  and  they
    started a relationship towards the end of June 2013.  LC fell  pregnant
    on 4th January 2014 and they have been together since then. Their child
    was born on 18th September 2014, child B. The Appellant had been living
    with LC since September 2015. LC  was  not  present  to  give  evidence
    because the Appellant had been told to seek an adjournment and  it  had
    been assumed that one would be granted. She did however  give  evidence
    before the First-tier Tribunal and there was evidence  in  her  written
    statements.

46.  LC was a British citizen and she would not be willing to go to Iran  as
    all her family were in the UK and she wanted her child to be brought up
    in the UK. She did not speak Farsi and she  understood  that  women  in
    Iran were subjugated and considered second  class  citizens.   She  had
    stated in evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  that  the  Appellant
    was a very caring father in relation to child A and spent lots of  time
    with him. In oral evidence she had stated that she was hoping to  marry
    the Appellant in the future but they had no plans for the moment.  They
    were not living together at that time because in the premises where she
    was staying she would have to go onto  joint  benefits.  Otherwise  she
    would have to pay a private rent and she could not  afford  that.   She
    did not wish to move out of her council accommodation  because  of  the
    uncertainty of the Appellant's status. She  did  however  hope  in  the
    future it would be sorted out and she would be able to live with him.

47.  There was also evidence from the mother  of  the  Appellant's  partner,
    FC. She gave evidence at the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and
    she described the difficult time that she  had  had  with  LC  and  the
    beginning of the Appellant's relationship  with  LC.   She  stated  the
    Appellant was very caring and that they seemed to be a good match.  She
    stated he was polite and respectful and people  make  mistakes  and  he
    deserved a second chance.  She confirmed that the Appellant and LC were
    in a genuine, serious and lasting relationship.

48.  The statement of RR confirmed the strong relationship with child A  and
    that the Appellant saw him a couple of times a week  if  not  more  and
    that child A's mother made it difficult for the Appellant  to  see  his
    son.

49.  The Appellant had suffered a head injury in 2006 when he was  assaulted
    with an axe.  This left  him  with  a  depressed  skull  fracture.   He
    continued to have problems mainly psychological and may have had  post-
    traumatic  stress  disorder,  the  Appellant's  evidence  that  he  was
    diagnosed with PTSD in 2009.  The Appellant was prescribed with various
    antidepressants and was  currently  receiving  psychotherapy  treatment
    from the local mental health team.



Legal Conclusions

50.  Applying sections 117A to D  of  the  2002  Act,  the  Appellant  is  a
    foreign criminal and his deportation is in the public interest. He  was
    sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 12 months  and  therefore  the
    public interest requires his deportation  unless  he  can  satisfy  the
    exceptions  in  section  117C  and  paragraphs  399  and  399A  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

Exception 1 (paragraph 399A)

51.  The Appellant is 29 years old and he came to the  UK  when  he  was  17
    years old. The Appellant entered the UK illegally and  claimed  asylum.
    He was granted discretionary leave from October 2004 to August 2005. He
    made a further application and his leave was extended under section  3C
    of the Act until February 2012 when he withdrew  his  application.  The
    Appellant remained in the UK illegally since  then.  He  has  not  been
    lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life.

52.  I accept that he is socially and culturally integrated  in  the  UK.  I
    find that the Appellant has failed to show that there  are  significant
    obstacles to integration in Iran. His mother still lives in Shiraz  and
    she has sent him inheritance money. He does not want  to  have  contact
    with her, but she maintained contact with his partner and child B. I do
    not accept his claim that his mother has been tortured because  it  was
    unsubstantiated and first raised in evidence in chief  at  the  hearing
    before me. His asylum claim was refused in 2004 and he has not  pursued
    his renewed claim. His initial account was inconsistent and  his  claim
    made in his submissions, that his family  were  freedom  fighters,  was
    inconsistent with his earlier claim. There was insufficient evidence to
    show that his  mental  health  problems  would  amount  to  significant
    obstacles to integration. Exception 1 does not apply.

Exception 2 (paragraph 399)

Partner

53.  The Appellant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  his
    partner, LC, who is in the UK and is a British  citizen.  However  that
    relationship  was  formed  after  the  Appellant  was  served  with   a
    deportation order. The Appellant cannot satisfy paragraph 399(b)(i) and
    little weight should be attached to such a relationship  under  section
    117B(4). In any event, the effect of the Appellant's deportation  would
    not be unduly harsh in the particular circumstances of the case. LC has
    been living with the Appellant for just over a year.  She  carries  the
    main responsibility for looking after child B. On the  Appellant's  own
    evidence, his ability to care for his  son  was  limited.  LC  has  the
    support of her mother.



Child A

54.  Child A was born on 29th March 2010 and is 6 years old.  The  Appellant
    had built up a relationship with child A whilst child A was in  the  UK
    and the Appellant was living with RR. The  Appellant  saw  child  A  at
    least twice a week and would sometimes look after him for  an  extended
    period. The Appellant was no longer  in  a  relationship  with  child's
    mother JZ and he did not reside within the family unit. In  June  2014,
    child A was taken to Israel by his mother JZ. The Appellant had limited
    contact with him since then. He spoke with child A infrequently and  JZ
    would not let him speak for long.

55.  It has not been shown that child A is a British  citizen.  He  has  not
    resided in the UK continuously for seven years and is not a  qualifying
    child. Exception 2 does not apply.

56.  In any event it would not be unduly harsh for child A to remain in  the
    UK, if he has returned from  Israel,  without  the  Appellant  for  the
    following reasons.  I  find  that  the  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with  child  A  prior  to  his  mother
    taking him to Israel  and  that  he  has  attempted  to  maintain  that
    relationship by Skype and telephone contact since then.  Save for these
    conversations, the Appellant has not seen child A for over two years.

57.  There was no additional feature affecting the nature or quality of  the
    relationship which take the case out of the ordinary  (see  AJ  below).
    The fact that the Appellant wishes to institute family  proceedings  in
    the UK is insufficient. Further, it does not  amount  to  a  compelling
    circumstance sufficient to outweigh the public interest in deportation.
    The Appellant could continue to instruct solicitors in the  UK  on  his
    behalf  to  pursue  any  family  court  application   and   there   was
    insufficient evidence before me  to  show  that  proceedings  had  been
    instituted. The hearing before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  wrongly
    allowed on the basis that there were Hague Convention proceedings.   No
    evidence has been produced to show that  was  in  the  fact  the  case.
    There was  insufficient  evidence  currently  before  me  to  show  the
    proceedings were ever commenced and it would appear that  they  are  no
    longer relevant if as the Appellant suspects that child A  is  back  in
    the UK. The seriousness of the offence outweighs the best interests  of
    the child A in this case.

Child B

58.  The Appellant is in a relationship with the  mother  of  child  B,  LC.
    They are not married, but they are living together and have been  doing
    so since September 2015.  Child B is 2 years and 3 months old and is  a
    British citizen. The Appellant takes him to play group with his partner
    LC. He is unable to take child B out on his own to busy  areas  because
    he does not feel confident doing so. However, he does play with child B
    in the park and in their own house and  garden.  The  Appellant  has  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with child B.

59.  The practicalities of the situation are that LC will not live  in  Iran
    and therefore child B will remain with her in the UK in the event  that
    the Appellant is deported. Accordingly, the relevant issue  is  whether
    it would be unduly harsh for child B to remain in the  UK  without  the
    Appellant.  Child  B  would  be  remaining  with  his  mother  and  his
    supportive grandmother. He has lived with his mother  since  birth  and
    has only lived with his father since September 2015. There is no reason
    why LC and child B could not visit Iran. Child B is a citizen of the UK
    and therefore would not be prevented from returning to the  UK  at  any
    point. The Appellant's mother still lives in Shiraz.  LC  and  child  B
    have had contact with her.

60.  In Secretary of State for the Home Department v AJ  (Zimbabwe)  and  VH
    (Vietnam) [2016] EWCA Civ 1012, the Court of Appeal held that it is now
    firmly established that the very strong  weight  given  to  the  public
    interest in deporting foreign criminals is not diluted where the rights
    of children are affected. "This court has on a number of occasions  had
    cause to emphasise that the mere fact that there will be a  detrimental
    effect on the best interests of the children where the  parent  (almost
    always the father) is deported  in  circumstances  where  the  children
    cannot  follow  him  does  not  in  itself  constitute  an  exceptional
    circumstance."

61.  At paragraph 17 the court held that: "...it will be rare for  the  best
    interests of the children to outweigh the  strong  public  interest  in
    deporting foreign criminals. Something more than a  lengthy  separation
    from a parent is required even though such separation is detrimental to
    the child's best interest. That is commonplace  and  not  a  compelling
    circumstance. Neither is it  looking  at  the  concept  of  exceptional
    circumstances through the lens  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  It  would
    undermine the specific exceptions in the Rules if the interests of  the
    children in maintaining the close and immediate relationship  with  the
    deported parent were a matter of course  to  trump  the  strong  public
    interest  in  deportation.  Rule   399A   identifies   the   particular
    circumstances where it is accepted that the interests of the child will
    outweigh the  public  interest  in  deportation.   The  conditions  are
    onerous and will only rarely arise.  They include the requirement  that
    it would not be reasonable for the child to leave the UK  and  that  no
    other family member is able to look after the child in the UK.  In many
    if not most cases where this exception  is  potentially  engaged  there
    will be the normal relationship of love and  affection  between  parent
    and child and it is virtually always in the best interests of the child
    for that relationship to continue.   If  that  were  enough  to  render
    deportation a disproportionate interference with family life  it  would
    drain the Rule of  any  practical  significance.  It  would  mean  that
    deportation  would  constitute  a  disproportionate  interference  with
    private life in the ordinary run of cases where children are  adversely
    affected and the carefully framed conditions  in  Rule  399A  would  be
    largely otiose. In order to establish a very  compelling  justification
    overriding the high public interest in deportation there must  be  some
    additional feature or features affecting the nature or quality  of  the
    relationship which take the case out of the ordinary."

62.  On the facts of this case, I find that  the  Appellant  has  not  shown
    that it would be unduly harsh for child B to remain in the  UK  without
    him.  He would continue living with his mother. Although it is  in  the
    best interests of child B to have contact  with  the  Appellant,  those
    interests do not outweigh the public  interest.  Even  if  child  B  is
    unable to visit his father in Iran and separation is lengthy, there  is
    no  additional  feature  affecting  the  nature  or  quality   of   the
    relationship which take the case out of the  ordinary.  There  were  no
    compelling reasons over and above the  exceptions  in  the  Immigration
    Rules and section 117C of the 2002 Act.

63.  I acknowledge that it is in the best interests of the child B  to  have
    the  benefit  of  both  parents.  However,  the  Appellant's  offending
    behaviour started in 2007 and continued after the deportation order was
    made, the most recent conviction was in 2016. Very serious weight is to
    be attached to the public interest in  deporting  the  Appellant  as  a
    foreign criminal. This cannot be outweighed by the  best  interests  of
    his child B.

64.   In  summary,  the  Appellant  has  not  shown,  on  the   balance   of
    probabilities, that the effect of his deportation on  his  partner  and
    two children would be unduly harsh.  I find that the  Appellant  cannot
    satisfy the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  his  deportation  would  be
    proportionate  under  the  2002  Act.   Accordingly,  I   dismiss   the
    Appellant's appeal.
