                                                                  Respondent

                                  DECISION


   1. The appellant has an appeal outstanding before the Upper Tribunal.  By
      letter dated 24 March 2014 the appellant states  that  she  wishes  to
      withdraw her appeal.

   2. Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 provides
      that a party may give notice of the withdrawal of its case or any part
      of it, subject to the consent of  the  Upper  Tribunal.  There  is  no
      provision for  a  party  to  withdraw  the  appeal  before  the  Upper
      Tribunal. Therefore, the letter from the appellant can serve only as a
      notice of withdrawal of her case before the Upper Tribunal,  to  which
      the Upper Tribunal now consents.

   3. Accordingly, the appellant's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed
      and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to  dismiss  her  appeal
      therefore stands.
