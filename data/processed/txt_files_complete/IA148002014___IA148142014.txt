For the appellants:    Mr M Hasan, instructed by Kalam Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of both the second appellant and  the  Secretary  of
    State,  in  respect  of  the  first   appellant   only,   against   the
    determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   Wilsher   promulgated
    31.10.14, dismissing the appeal of the second  appellant  but  allowing
    the appeal of the first appellant on immigration  grounds  against  the
    decisions of the respondent, dated 27.2.14 and 26.3.14, to refuse leave
    to remain in the UK.  The Judge heard the appeal on 16.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge White granted permission to  appeal  to  both
    the second appellant and the Secretary of State on 11.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 3.2.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Wilsher should be set aside.

 5. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    appellant came to the UK on  11.10.03  as  a  student.  His  leave  was
    subsequently extended to 12.1.14. However, on  26.5.12  his  leave  was
    curtailed, because his educational sponsor lost its licence. He  claims
    not to have received notice of  curtailment  and  on  16.9.13  made  an
    application for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) on  the  basis  of  10
    years' lawful residence. The application was refused on 27.2.14.

 6. The second appellant, the spouse of the first appellant, first  entered
    the UK  on  22.12.08  with  leave  as  his  dependant.  Her  leave  was
    subsequently extended to 12.1.14. On 9.1.14  she  applied  for  further
    leave to remain as a partner, using form LFR(FP). The  application  was
    refused on 26.3.14.

 7. Finding that the Secretary of State was not entitled to  rely  on  mere
    postal service, citing Syed (Curtailment of Leave - Notice) [2013] UKUT
    00144, Judge Wilshire  concluded  that  the  first  appellant  was  not
    validly served with the curtailment notice and thus his leave continued
    unaffected. It followed that he did meet the 10-year continuous  lawful
    residence requirement and is entitled  to  ILR  pursuant  to  paragraph
    276B, meeting all other requirements.

 8. In respect of the second appellant Judge Wilshire  considered  that  as
    the first appellant had secured ILR under the 10 year rule, and was  no
    longer a points-based scheme migrant, his wife must be considered under
    Appendix FM and cannot benefit from the  more  generous  provisions  of
    paragraph 319C. As she did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM, in
    particular as to the financial requirements, her appeal was dismissed.

 9. In granting permission to the Secretary of State to appeal the decision
    in relation to the first appellant, Judge White considered it  arguable
    that the  judge  made  an  error  of  law  in  finding  the  notice  of
    curtailment of leave had not been validly served.

10. In granting permission to the second appellant, Judge  White  found  it
    arguable that there is inconsistency constituting an error  of  law  by
    dismissing the second appellant's appeal whilst allowing  that  of  her
    husband the first appellant.

11. The rule 24 response of the Secretary of State to  the  appeal  of  the
    second appellant is that Chikwamba is  not  relevant  as  it  has  been
    overtaken by the introduction of the  family  life  provisions  of  the
    Immigration Rules, notably Appendix FM, which the second appellant does
    not meet. Further, the judge was  in  error  in  the  approach  to  the
    circumstances of the second appellant at  the  date  of  his  decision,
    since at that date whilst the first appellant had succeeded on  appeal,
    he did not have ILR, which is a status that can only be granted by  the
    Secretary of State.

12. In his submissions  Mr  Nath  stated  that  curtailment  decisions  are
    routinely sent by recorded delivery, which was the process  adopted  in
    2012 when curtailing the leave of the first appellant.

13. Syed points out that the Immigration (Notices) Regulations 2003 do  not
    apply to a curtailment decision, as it is not an  immigration  decision
    under section 82 of the 2002 Act. There are no statutory provisions for
    the giving of such notices. "Accordingly, the Secretary of State has to
    be able to prove that notice of such a decision was communicated to the
    person concerned, in order for it to be effective."  The  Secretary  of
    State  cannot  rely  on  deemed  postal   service.   The   respondent's
    Enforcement Instructions and Guidance was handed to me, which at 50.8.1
    refers to Syed and points out that the position in Syed  was  rectified
    by the Immigration (Leave to Enter and Remain) (Amendment) Order  2013,
    allowing for postal or email service. However,  this  only  has  effect
    from 12.7.13. For service prior to that date the guidance  states  that
    the onus of proving that the notice was effectively served  is  on  the
    Home Office.

14. The evidence adduced by Mr Nath includes the Case Record  Sheet,  dated
    27.3.12, showing the curtailment decision, curtailing leave to 60 days,
    was dispatched by post to the  first  appellant's  address  at  [  -  ]
    Portland Road, [ - ] by recorded  delivery,  and  citing  the  recorded
    delivery reference. The note also records that there had been a  number
    of attempts to serve the curtailment decision via the college, but they
    were returned as 'Addressee gone away,' and thus the recorded  delivery
    service to the first appellant's last known address. Mr  Nath  told  me
    that the recorded delivery notice sent to the appellant's  address  had
    not been returned.

15. The Guidance does not say that postal service cannot be  effective  and
    sets out checks to be made that service was effective.  If  the  notice
    was served to file or returned by post  as  undeliverable,  it  has  no
    effect and a fresh curtailment decision must be  made  giving  60  days
    leave from that point. "If, when interviewed, the migrant claims not to
    have received the notice of curtailment,  the  officer  must  establish
    whether the notice was served to the correct address for  the  migrant.
    The address of an educational institution is not sufficient unless  you
    can  show  that,  on  the  balance  of   probabilities,   the   migrant
    subsequently received the notice from the college."

16. It follows that postal service can be relied on, provided the Secretary
    of State discharges the burden of proving  effective  service,  on  the
    balance of  probabilities.  That  is  probably  why  recorded  delivery
    service was used. I note in Syed that  the  notice  had  been  sent  by
    recorded delivery but had been returned as undelivered and  the  notice
    was then served to file. The return of the letters by the  Post  Office
    proved that they had not been served on the appellant. Clearly, where a
    registered letter has been sent but returned as  undelivered  effective
    service has not taken  place.  Syed  cited  the  case  of  R  v  Appeal
    Committee of County of London Quarter Sessions, Ex Parte Rossi [1956] 1
    AER, where it was held by Denning  LJ  that  a  returned  unopened  and
    undelivered notice was not effective service, but the judgement goes on
    to state that effective service "could be done by proof that  a  notice
    had been sent to him in good time by post in a registered letter  which
    had not been returned, for it could then be assumed that  it  had  been
    delivered in the ordinary course of post."

17. It follows that mere posting of the notice cannot be  sufficient  proof
    of  service.  Even  attempted  recorded  delivery  service  cannot   be
    effective, where the notice is returned undelivered. But in the present
    case it was sent by recorded delivery to  the  first  appellant's  last
    known address, as confirmed by the print out of the computer  CID  file
    and the GCID Case Record Sheet, and not returned. The notice  was  sent
    to the address on file. I find that the Secretary of State was entitled
    to rely on  unreturned  recorded  delivery  as  effective  service.  It
    follows that on the balance of probabilities  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge made a significant error of law by finding at ï¿½5 that  the  steps
    taken by the Secretary of State  were  insufficient  to  discharge  the
    burden of proof and that  this  amounts  to  such  an  error  that  the
    decision cannot stand and must be set aside and remade.

18. In remaking the decision, taking into account the claim  of  the  first
    appellant that he did not receive the notice, I reach the conclusion on
    the balance of probabilities that the curtailment had been  effectively
    served on the first appellant. It was for the  appellant  to  keep  the
    Home Office apprised of his current address. If he had  moved,  he  did
    not notify the Home Office. Whilst it may be speculation as to  whether
    he would have been alive to the issue of curtailment  because  he  must
    have known that the college's licence had been lost, it is relevant  to
    the credibility of his claim that he  not  only  did  not  receive  the
    curtailment but was totally unaware of it.  Frankly,  I  find  that  it
    would have been obvious to him that such a curtailment was very likely.

19. It follows that the first appellant's leave did not continue beyond May
    2012 and thus  he  was  not  entitled  to  ILR  on  the  long-residence
    provisions. He had no right to remain in the UK  beyond  May  2012.  It
    also follows that the appeal of the second  appellant  must  fail.  The
    First-tier Tribunal was in error in finding that her application had to
    be considered under Appendix FM on the basis that the  first  appellant
    had ILR. As has been pointed out by the respondent's Rule 24  response,
    the fact that he succeeded on the appeal  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    does not equate to him having ILR at the date  of  application  of  the
    second appellant. He could not have such an immigration status until it
    was granted by the Secretary of State. However, the  judge's  error  in
    this regard is  not  material  as  the  dismissal  of  the  appeal  was
    inevitable once it becomes clear that the first appellant did not  have
    leave to remain beyond May 2012.  Neither appellant could have had  any
    right to remain in the UK beyond May 2012.

20. Whilst article 8 ECHR has not been directly addressed, it is clear that
    neither appellant can meet the requirements of Appendix FM or paragraph
    276ADE, for the reasons cited in the refusal decisions and  which  does
    not need to be repeated here. Neither appellant is settled  in  the  UK
    and as they are together they do not qualify as parents  of  their  son
    born 22.12.12, who is not  a  British  citizen  and  has  no  right  of
    settlement in the UK.  Their  family  life  can  continue  together  in
    Bangladesh and there is thus no  interference  with  that  family  life
    sufficient to engage article 8 ECHR following the  Razgar  five  steps.
    Further, they have not shown that they  have  no  ties  to  Bangladesh,
    including family, social and cultural. Whilst they may  have  developed
    private life in the UK, such private life was as student  and  latterly
    as persons without lawful leave to remain. In the light of  cases  such
    as Nasim and Patel, it is clear that the development of private life as
    a student in the UK is outside the type of rights to  be  protected  by
    article 8. In Nasim and others (article 8) [2014] UKUT 00025 (IAC), the
    Upper Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical removal  of  the  22
    PBS claimants, pursuant to the decision to refuse to vary leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity."

21. Even if there were compelling circumstances not  adequately  recognised
    by the Immigration Rules so as to justify considering leave  to  remain
    under article 8 ECHR private and family life  outside  the  Immigration
    Rules, recognising that Appendix FM and  paragraph  276ADE  are  not  a
    complete code, I find on the Razgar balancing exercise between  on  the
    one hand the rights of the appellants and on the other  the  legitimate
    and necessary public interest in their removal to protect the  economic
    well-being of the UK through immigration control, that the decisions to
    refuse to vary leave to remain and to remove the appellants from the UK
    by way of directions under section 47 of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 are entirely proportionate and do  not  produce  a
    result which  is  unjustifiably  harsh.  The  appellants  can  have  no
    legitimate expectation to remain in the UK except  in  accordance  with
    immigration  rules,  with  which  they  have  failed   to   demonstrate
    compliance. They are not entitled to remain in the UK simply by  reason
    of their length of stay, a good proportion of which was without  lawful
    leave. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with  the  Rules.  The
    appellants came as student and dependant and the purpose of their visit
    has long since expired. I also have to take into account  section  117B
    of the 2002 Act to the extent that I find that on  their  circumstances
    little weight should  be  given  in  the  balance  against  the  public
    interest in their removal to any private life or  relationship  with  a
    partner developed whilst they have been in the UK  unlawfully.  In  the
    circumstances,  their  removal  is  neither  unjustifiably  harsh   nor
    disproportionate.

Conclusion & Decision

22. For the reasons set out above, I fin that the making of the decision of
    the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error on  a  point
    of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by  dismissing  the
                    appeal of each appellant.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
