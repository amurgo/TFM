Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Richardson, Counsel instructed by Farooq Bajwa &
                       Co
For the Respondent:    Ms Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan  date  of  birth  18th  January
    1992. She appeals with permission against the decision  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge O'Rourke) to dismiss her appeal against a decision
    to refuse to grant her further leave to  remain  as  a  spouse  and  to
    remove her from the UK pursuant to s47 of the  Immigration  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.


 2. There were two matters in issue before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    first was whether the Appellant could meet the maintenance requirements
    relating to partners.  The notice of decision, dated 29th October 2014,
    lists the specified evidence required under Appendix  FM  to  establish
    that she and her partner had an income of  at  least  ï¿½18,600.    Since
    some of these documents had not been submitted with the application, it
    had been refused. The second matter related  to  her  English  language
    ability, the Respondent finding that  she  had  failed  to  supply  the
    certificate issued by the University of London in respect of  her  LLB,
    such evidence being an acceptable alternative to  an  English  language
    test certificate.

 3. On appeal the Appellant had supplied further documentary evidence: this
    is recorded at paragraph 5 of the determination.  At  paragraph  3  the
    following concession  by  the  Presenting  Officer  is  recorded:  "the
    Respondent, in turn, accepted that documentation meeting the  financial
    and language requirement  had  now  been  supplied".   The  appeal  was
    nevertheless dismissed on the  ground  that  the  relevant  documentary
    evidence had not been submitted at the date of  application.  Reference
    is made to s85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as
    amended) and Alam and Ors v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 960 .



    Error of Law

 4. As Ms Savage for the Secretary of State realistically accepts the First-
    tier Tribunal erred in its  approach  to  the  new  evidence  that  was
    submitted. Section 85A precludes the admission of further evidence post-
    application but it only applies to cases determined under  the  "Points
    Based System". It does not apply to applications  concerning  leave  to
    remain as a partner. The post-application evidence was, in  this  case,
    admissible as it pertained to matters  in  existence  at  the  date  of
    decision: s85(4).


 5. The refusal to consider the new material was an error of  law  and  the
    decision must therefore be set aside.


    The Re-Making


 6. There was a  clear  concession  of  fact  made  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The Home Office Presenting Officer on the  day  had  accepted
    that the evidence established, on a balance of probabilities, that  the
    Appellant met all of the requirements of the Rules.  That  is  apparent
    from paragraph 3 of the determination.


 7. Ms Savage did not dispute that the concession had been made, but sought
    to withdraw it.   She agreed that the Appellant had produced acceptable
    evidence relating to her ability to speak English,  but  the  documents
    produced in respect of finances were not,  she  submitted,  capable  of
    meeting the requirements of Appendices FM or FM-SE.  That  was  because
    the material produced related to the financial year 2012-2013  when  it
    should have related to the last financial year prior to the application
    being lodged. The application was made on the 27th October 2014 so  the
    relevant period was 2012-2013.

 8. Mr Richardson protested that the Rule 24 response had not said anything
    about withdrawing the concession. The Appellant had not therefore  been
    prepared to argue the  point  again;  he  did  not  have  the  original
    documents with him and indeed the Appellant  herself  was  not  at  the
    hearing.  His instructions were that original documentary evidence  had
    been produced at the hearing which the Judge, and presumably the  HOPO,
    had had regard to when the decision was made.

 9. I find that the concession recorded at paragraph 3 is one of fact,  and
    that the Secretary of State should only be permitted to withdraw it  if
    there is good reason to do so.  It can be presumed that  the  HOPO  who
    appeared before the First-tier Tribunal was competent to the extent  of
    being able to identify what documents were needed to establish that the
    couple had the requisite income. It is unfortunate  that  the  original
    documents seen by that HOPO were not available for Ms Savage to inspect
    but as Mr Richardson notes, the Appellant can hardly be blamed for that
    since she was given no notice at all that the  Secretary  of  State  's
    position was going to change. She prepared  her  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis of the determination and the  Rule  24  response.
    For those reasons I do not consider there to be a good reason to permit
    the Secretary of State to withdraw her concession of fact  made  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

10. It follows that the appeal must be allowed, since the only issue raised
    in this appeal has ben resolved in the Appellant's favour.


      Decision

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.


12. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
