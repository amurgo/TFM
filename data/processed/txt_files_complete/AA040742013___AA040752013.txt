Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr C Talacchi, counsel, instructed by Longfellow
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are nationals of Pakistan where they were born in  1984.
    They appeal with permission the determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge J Molloy.  RS is a dependant on an asylum claim by  TR  based  on
    their gay relationship and the implications that would ensue if removed
    to Pakistan.

 2. TR entered the United Kingdom as a student in May 2009 and RS  followed
    in January 2010.  TR only attended classes for three months and applied
    for asylum in April 2013 along with RS.  They were served with  removal
    notices dated 19 April 2013 against which they appealed to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

 3. The respondent did not accept that the  appellants  are  gay  based  on
    concerns over the consistency of their accounts of events  in  Pakistan
    prior  to  arrival  and  subsequently  in  the  United  Kingdom.    The
    respondent  considered  the  credibility  was  damaged  by  TR's   poor
    immigration history and the claim to asylum having been made  after  he
    had been encountered.

 4. On 16 May 2013 First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Parker  gave  an  anonymity
    direction which was continued by Judge Molloy.  Although no application
    was made, we continue that direction.  No report or  other  publication
    of the proceedings or any part  of  them  shall  name  or  directly  or
    indirectly identify  the  appellants.   Reference  may  be  by  use  of
    initials but not by name.  Failure to comply with  this  direction  may
    lead to proceedings for contempt of court.

 5. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  on  the  basis
    that First-tier Tribunal Judge Parkes considered  the  complaints  made
    about the conduct of the hearing that it  was  inherently  unfair  with
    witnesses being  badgered  plus  errors  in  the  credibility  findings
    appeared to have merit.  He observed that the determination was far too
    long and detailed to be readily followed and understood.

The Hearing in the First-tier Tribunal

 6. There are some unusual features with regard to  the  journey  of  these
    appeals in the First-tier Tribunal.  They were listed for hearing on 30
    May 2013 which was adjourned unopposed at the appellants' request.  The
    reasons were that the  appellants  were  due  to  enter  into  a  civil
    partnership  on  6  June  and  because  of  late  service  of   certain
    documentation by the respondent.  It appears that the latter  persuaded
    Judge Molloy to postpone the hearing which resumed on 16 August when TR
    and RS gave evidence together with Naveed Ahmad.  Proceedings  finished
    at  6  o'clock  when  the  case  was  adjourned  to  another  date  for
    submissions  and  for  the  originals  of  certain  photographs  to  be
    provided.

 7. The hearing resumed on 30 October by when there was a change of counsel
    with Mr  Talacchi  taking  over  from  Ms  Tobin.   There  was  also  a
    replacement Presenting Officer.  Prior notice had been given of further
    evidence  the  appellants  wished  to  rely  on,  being   their   civil
    partnership having taken place and warrants for the arrest in Pakistan.
     TR and RS gave further evidence.

 8. That hearing was also adjourned in order for the production of  further
    documentation regarding the arrest warrant and for an issue to be dealt
    with regarding the interpretation of RS's evidence on 16 August.  Judge
    Molloy explained that, as was the  position  following  the  16  August
    adjournment, he would be preparing a draft part-determination based  on
    what had occurred but he would not be making any findings of fact.

 9. At the resumed hearing on 25 November, by when the interpretation issue
    had been resolved, TR gave evidence again about the civil  partnership.
    Although RS was also given the opportunity to give evidence,  this  was
    declined by Mr Talacchi.  Submissions followed after which the decision
    was reserved.

10. The detail of the above events,  coupled  with  the  substance  of  the
    evidence given, is set out in 373  paragraphs  over  52  pages  of  the
    judge's determination.  Between paragraphs  374  and  646,  another  34
    pages, the judge sets out his  conclusions  which  are  expressed  with
    uncharacteristic succinctness at [601]:

         "For the avoidance of doubt the  Tribunal  finds  that  it  is  not
         persuaded that either of the couple is at real risk  on  return  to
         Pakistan of being regarded as  a  person  of  same-sex  orientation
         whether this be actual or imputed."

    This was in the context of an earlier direction that a male of same-sex
    orientation would face a risk of serious harm amounting to  persecution
    for breach of his absolute rights under the Human Rights Convention  in
    Pakistan.  The judge considered the claim to be  nothing  more  than  a
    fabrication and the documents introduced in support could not be relied
    upon.  He found that  the  civil  partnership  was  an  arrangement  of
    convenience and as a consequence there was no family life.

11. The appeals were also considered under Article 8 which gave  the  other
    judge some anxiety as he understood the  appellants  had  been  granted
    leave  to  remain  for  a  period  exceeding  one  year  despite  their
    protection claims having been protected.

Grounds of Challenge

12. Of the three grounds of challenge, Mr Talacchi considered the first two
    overlapped.  He adopted the lengthy grounds which he fleshed  out  with
    oral submissions.

13. The first ground argues that the judge had committed  "...a  procedural
    error capable of making a material difference to  the  outcome  of  the
    fairness of the proceedings".  The second ground is that  "the  hearing
    was inherently unfair".  The second ground clarifies the  reference  to
    "the outcome of the fairness of the proceedings" in the first.

14. The substance of the complaint in the first ground is  that  the  judge
    had entered the arena indicating on more than one occasion that further
    and better particulars were required of TR's evidence which resulted in
    TR and RS being asked questions repeatedly on the same  topics  by  the
    Presenting  Officer.   The  hearing  was  no  longer  adversarial   but
    inquisitorial.  It is argued that it was undesirable for the  judge  to
    direct what questions should be asked to the witness.  His role  is  to
    seek clarification but to direct cross-examination to  the  respondent.
    Examples  are  given  of  inappropriate  interventions,  including   an
    indication when the hearing reconvened (the grounds  erroneously  refer
    to 16 August 2013) that he needed clarification.  The  judge  had  also
    raised concerns about the contradictions between  the  evidence  of  Mr
    Ahmad and TR.   The  judge  also  wanted  clarification  regarding  the
    identity of a mullah for whom two different names had been given, of  a
    relationship between TR and a female in Pakistan.

15. As to the second ground,  it  is  argued  that  when  a  witness  gives
    evidence he must do so without being  badgered  and  interrupted.   The
    continuous questioning resulted in the judge applying a higher standard
    of proof and that the judge had appeared to  make  adverse  credibility
    findings on the basis that material was not contained  in  the  witness
    statements.

16. In his oral submissions, Mr Talacchi explained that  the  reference  to
    badgering in his grounds was meant to cover a situation where the party
    had already given evidence and been asked to do so again.

17. Ground 3 argues that material errors were made in  the  making  of  the
    adverse credibility findings.  It is contended that those findings  are
    speculative, tenuous and not based on objective background evidence but
    on the judge's own views.  Seven examples are given to  illustrate  the
    ground.  We return to these in more detail below.

18. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Avery contended that the  judge
    had given anxious scrutiny and on the  issues  raised,  it  was  not  a
    question of giving the Secretary of State a further opportunity but  to
    give TR (and RS)  the  chance  to  respond.   It  was  very  unfair  to
    criticise the judge as pursuing the former.  In respect  of  the  third
    ground, Mr Avery considered the judge would have  background  knowledge
    and that he had not gone too fair  on  Mr  Talacchi  acknowledging  the
    judge was entitled to an extent to rely on that knowledge.

Our Conclusions

19. We are not persuaded that the judge erred in the manner claimed.  It is
    not a ground of challenge that the determination is too long or is  for
    some other reason incomprehensible; it was unnecessary for Judge Parkes
    to make such observations.  Given time, it is possible  to  follow  and
    understand the reasons given  by  Judge  Molloy  for  disbelieving  the
    appellants.  That is not to say there was a need for a determination of
    this length.  To  observe  that  its  contents  are  exhaustive  is  an
    understatement.  This is in large part due to  the  judge  providing  a
    "real time" account of  events  when,  absent  any  serious  procedural
    issues, there was no reason for him to do so.

20. Each judge has a different style; some are able to produce short, crisp
    judgments, but others prefer a more expansive  approach.   The  overall
    objective is  to  produce  a  comprehensible  document  explaining  the
    issues, pr�cising the evidence relevant to those  issues,  setting  out
    the law, and to give adequate reasons for the decision.  Nothing  more,
    nothing less.

21. But as we have said, the length is not the complaint.

22. On our  reading  of  the  determination,  we  are  satisfied  that  the
    interventions by Judge Molloy were properly for clarification on points
    that were troubling him.  We now understand more fully the reference to
    "badgering" in the grounds.  The context also needs to be  appreciated.
    Although Mr Talacchi has not said so, he did not have the advantage  of
    having heard first-hand the evidence given on 16 August.  It  is  clear
    the judge gave anxious scrutiny to all the evidence  before  him  which
    was on the whole germane to the issues upon which he had to adjudicate.

23. Turning to the third ground,  in  particular  the  assertion  that  the
    judge's findings were speculative without  reference  to  any  concrete
    evidence, Mr Talacchi illustrated this  by  reference  to  the  judge's
    observation at [385] of his determination when  he  was  assessing  the
    evidence about what boys would talk about at school and what they would
    do.  The  judge  had  observed  from  his  understanding  of  life  and
    behaviour in Pakistan where Islam is the state religion that boys there
    generally speaking behaved themselves.  Any difficulties with this  are
    met by the judge directing himself at [388] that he would not go so far
    as to say there would be no boys and girls in Pakistan who would engage
    in such behaviour and he expressed awareness that there is a reasonable
    degree of likelihood that what some would say is a moral behaviour does
    take place in Pakistan.  The judge was concerned about TR's evidence in
    his witness statement that the immoral  behaviour  he  claims  to  have
    experienced was much more widespread  than  previously  thought.   Here
    again  he  referred  to  his  individual  and   collective   specialist
    experience of social and religious mores  and  found  it  difficult  to
    believe the claims as reasonably likely to be true.

24. If this were the only or  principal  reason  given  by  the  judge  for
    rejecting the account, we would be inclined to agree with Mr  Talacchi.
    But this is not the case.  The judge gave a number of reasons  for  his
    disbelief and we  are  not  persuaded  that  this  selected  aspect  is
    sufficient to undermine the credibility findings as a whole.  We have a
    similar view with regard to the further points in the ground  regarding
    TR's relationship with a girl who used to live near his family's  home.
    That evidence included the girl having consented to the couple trying a
    sexual relationship and furthermore an invitation  to  engage  in  anal
    intercourse.  What concerned the judge  was  the  plausibility  of  the
    expression of such relationship for three to four  months  and  it  was
    open to him to question whether such a  relationship  could  have  been
    carried on by a girl living nearby.

25. Part of the account before the judge was that the appellants  had  been
    playing snooker in a madrassa  and  had  been  caught  kissing  in  the
    lavatories in Pakistan.  The judge was concerned  about  RS's  lack  of
    knowledge about what a break was and it was open to him, in  our  view,
    to find that he was not a  snooker  player  which  contributed  to  his
    doubts about the party's truthfulness.  Again, it was not a pivotal  or
    core point.

26. Finally, the query by the judge regarding the  extraterritorial  effect
    of the criminal jurisdiction in Pakistan needs to be considered in  the
    context of the evidence.  According to a translation of an article in a
    newspaper called Daily Life Times, the  police  are  reported  to  have
    registered a case on charges of homosexuality against men  residing  in
    the United Kingdom.  That case had been registered on the complaint  of
    "area residents" after an emergency meeting of the "area committee"  in
    which  they  demanded  that  the  accused  be  stoned  to  death.   The
    appellants are identified.  Area residents are quoted  as  having  said
    that in non-Muslim society homosexuality might be acceptable but sharia
    and the law of Pakistan did not allow such acts.  What  seems  to  have
    troubled the judge is the absence of evidence that the appellants could
    under Pakistan law be prosecuted in that country for activities abroad.
     It was legitimate for him to express those concerns.

27. In short, the challenge to the credibility findings is  a  disagreement
    with  the  evidence;  the  judge  did  not  make  an  error   of   law.
    Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
