                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Mayall, promulgated on 16 March 2016. Permission to appeal was  granted
    by First-tier Tribunal Judge JM Holmes on 4 May 2016.

Anonymity

   2. A direction was made previously for the  benefit  of  the  appellant's
      then minor child, and this is reiterated below.

Background

 3. The appellant, who is a national of Bulgaria,  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom during September 2010. She first came to the attention  of  the
    respondent on 16 January 2013  when  she  applied  for  a  registration
    certificate as confirmation of a right to reside in the United  Kingdom
    as a self-employed person. That application was refused on 29 May 2013.
    The appellant next came to the  respondent's  attention  following  her
    conviction, on 21 March 2014, on twelve counts of theft by an  employee
    for which she was sentenced to 43 months' imprisonment. The  sentencing
    judge calculated the value of the items stolen as being of the order of
    around �30,000.

 4. On 11 June  2014,  the  appellant  was  sent  notice  of  liability  to
    deportation, in response to which she sent representations in which she
    explained that her disabled husband and their son and daughter, aged 23
    and 17, also resided with her in the United Kingdom. Her daughter was a
    carer for her father and her son worked full-time to support the family
    while the appellant was imprisoned.

 5. The respondent signed a deportation  order  on  1  September  2015.  An
    accompanying  decision  notice  of  the   same   date   contained   the
    respondent's reasons for doing so. The respondent did not  accept  that
    the appellant had acquired the right  of  permanent  residence  in  the
    United Kingdom for the following reasons. The appellant had provided no
    evidence of exercising treaty rights in the  United  Kingdom;  she  had
    provided no evidence that she had permission to work  nor  evidence  of
    self-employment and therefore it was not accepted  that  she  had  been
    lawfully resident in accordance with the Immigration (European Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 for a continuous period of five years since  her
    arrival in the United Kingdom. The respondent therefore considered that
    the appellant might be deported on the grounds  of  public  policy  and
    public security in accordance with  regulation  19(3)(b)  of  the  said
    Regulations. All the available evidence  indicated  to  the  respondent
    that  the  appellant  had  a  propensity  to  re-offend  and  that  she
    represented a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  to  the
    public to justify her deportation on grounds of public policy and  that
    the decision to deport her was proportionate both under the Regulations
    and Article 8 ECHR.

The hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal,  the  judge  heard  oral
    evidence from the appellant, her husband and her  daughter,  then  aged
    seventeen. In addition, the evidence before the judge included an OASys
    assessment dated 4 November 2015, an OASys  assessment  dated  18  July
    2014, a National Probation Service Progress Report  dated  11  December
    2014 and a NOMS1 report dated 11 June 2014.




 7. The judge disagreed with the categorisation of the appellant  as  being
    at low risk of re-conviction, considering the risk  to  be  medium  and
    therefore found that the appellant presented  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society.

 8. The judge considered that the decision to deport the appellant complied
    with the  principle  of  the  proportionality  under  the  Regulations.
    Considering Article 8 ECHR outside the Regulations, the judge concluded
    that the public interests greatly outweighed the factors in  favour  of
    the appellant.

The grounds of appeal

 9. There were four grounds in support of the application for permission to
    appeal.

10. The first ground was that the judge had misinterpreted  and  misapplied
    EU law to the facts of the case. Reference was made to the NOMS1 report
    where it was said that the appellant posed a low risk of serious  harm.
    It was argued that this assessment was insufficient to merit a  finding
    that she presents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  risk  of
    harm to the public and for the judge to do so amounted to an  error  of
    law.

11. The second ground argued that the judge failed to give adequate reasons
    for departing from the risk assessment in the OASys reports.  Reference
    was made to documentary evidence of the appellant's exemplary behaviour
    while imprisoned which it was said pointed to a  reduced  risk  of  re-
    offending.

12. Ground three criticised the delay between the hearing of the appeal and
    the promulgation of  the  decision  and  reasons,  which  it  was  said
    appeared to have been drafted on 16 March 2016. It was  submitted  that
    the judge's departure from the professional risk assessment  was  based
    on the credibility of the appellant and that  the  delay  rendered  his
    decision unsafe.

13. Finally, ground four argued  that  the  judge  incorrectly  applied  MA
    (Pakistan)[2014]  EWCA  Civ  163,  which  was  referred   to   by   the
    respondent's representative before the judge and in reply, counsel  for
    the appellant had argued that this case was not an EEA case  and  could
    not be applied here. It was argued that the judge failed to  adequately
    address this issue.

14. Permission to appeal was granted on all grounds.
















The hearing

15. Mr � Ceallaigh acknowledged from the outset that the  judge's  decision
    was thorough. Addressing the grounds in order, he argued that there had
    been two assessments by probation while the appellant was in prison and
    the authors of those reports were in a better to position to assess the
    risk. The judge identified no sufficiently strong reason to  go  behind
    the risk assessments.  For  instance,  the  judge  had  said  that  the
    appellant did not accept responsibility for her offending, whereas Mr �
    Ceallaigh said that such an attitude occurred frequently. The  starting
    point of the reports was the appellant's offending.

16. In relation to  the  second  ground,  he  highlighted  the  appellant's
    excellent behaviour during her imprisonment; that she had  no  previous
    convictions (it being assumed there were no convictions  in  Bulgaria),
    however the appellant had not repaid any of the  approximately  �30,000
    worth of items and money she stole.

17. Mr � Ceallaigh stated, regarding the third ground, that  the  benchmark
    was 3 months and that a delay of this order gave the impression  to  an
    appellant that the judge may have forgotten the facts. In this case the
    issue was that of risk, albeit Mr � Ceallaigh did not expand upon  what
    the oral evidence was as to risk. At this  point,  we  referred  to  an
    entry on the  appellant's  IAC  case  file  showing  that  the  judge's
    decision and reasons was sent for typing on 4 January 2016 and was duly
    typed the following day. Mr � Ceallaigh said that the question was more
    of perception than a matter of pointing to a specific error.

18. Finally, with the fourth ground, Mr � Ceallaigh argued that with regard
    to MA (Pakistan), the error of the judge was in saying that low risk in
    criminal context does not mean that this is the case in an  immigration
    context. He concluded by saying that the  judge  was  not  entitled  to
    disregard the probation assessment in this instance.

19. In reply, Mr  Wilding  stated  that  all  but  the  third  ground  were
    intertwined. He argued  that  the  judge  forensically  considered  the
    material and that if the arguments on  behalf  of  the  appellant  were
    accepted  this  would  mean  that  the  assessed  low  risk  would   be
    determinative of  the  appeal.  The  judge  assessed  the  professional
    reports against the appellant's oral evidence that it was not  her  who
    stole from her clients. The criticism on  the  appellant's  behalf  was
    mere disagreement. The judge did not fail to consider any  evidence  or
    misunderstand anything.

20. Mr Wilding relied  on  Vasconcelos  (risk-rehabilitation)  [2013]  UKUT
    00378 (IAC),  where  the  proposition  that  an  OAsys  assessment  was
    determinative  was  rejected.  He  argued  that  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence regarding the offence was relevant as was the  fact  that  she
    pleaded  guilty  and  that  the  wrong  number  of  offences  had  been
    considered in one of the reports. With regard to MA (Pakistan), it  was
    unfair to criticise the judge given his self-direction on the point. As
    far as delay was concerned, Mr Wilding was of the view  that  this  did
    not have any impact upon the judge's assessment of credibility  or  the
    evidence. With regard to the evidence, there had been  very  little  in
    terms of dispute.

21. Mr � Ceallaigh added little in response.

22. At the end of the hearing, we reserved our decision which we  now  give
    with our reasons.

Decision on error of law

23. The first ground  argued  that  because  the  appellant  was  found  by
    professionals to pose no risk of serious harm, it was not open  to  the
    judge to find that she represented a genuine, present and  sufficiently
    serious threat to the public.

24. In considering the risk of serious harm, the judge had  regard  to  all
    the evidence before him including the remarks of the sentencing  judge,
    who said that "These matters seem to me to be extremely serious. It  is
    a plain breach of trust, and a breach of trust of the  highest  degree,
    taking place not only in the home but for people who trusted  you  with
    their possessions."  The remarks continue;  "The  Indictment  makes  it
    clear that it is multiple thefts over a long period of time,  and  with
    multiple victims."  With  reference  to  reference  to  the  Sentencing
    Guidelines  Council's  overarching  principles  of   seriousness,   the
    sentencing judge considered that the  fact  that  there  were  multiple
    victims to be "a factor indicating a more than usually  serious  degree
    of harm."

25. At [68] the judge, with  explicit  reference  to  the  remarks  of  the
    sentencing judge, considered that the effect of  the  offences  on  the
    victims was "great," that "real harm" was inflicted on the  victims  of
    this type of crime and were the appellant  to  re-offend  in  the  same
    manner, the harm could well be "serious."

26. The first OASys  report  was  somewhat  dismissive  of  impact  on  the
    victims. At 2.5, the following was said;

    "As the victims of the offence are sufficiently  buoyant  to  employ  a
    cleaner to clean their accommodation, the loss of the article could  be
    more of a sentimental value rather than a major  loss,  also  that  the
    fact that there is a reliance on the trust of the  people  you  employ,
    this could be seriously denied."

27. The actual impact on the appellant's twelve victims  was  addressed  by
    the sentencing judge at considerable length in his remarks. While  many
    of the victims lost expensive items and  those  of  sentimental  value,
    there are also references to one victim  needing  a  cleaner  owing  to
    suffering from multiple sclerosis and the appellant taking advantage of
    his disability. There are also references to the ruses employed by  the
    appellant to carry out her offences in  the  presence  of  the  victims
    (counts 5, 10 and 12).

28. In view of the evidence before him, we find  that  the  judge  made  no
    error in considering the appellant to represent a genuine, present  and
    sufficiently serious threat.

29. In view of the guidance given  in  Vasconcelos,  the  first  ground  is
    completely lacking in merit.

30. Moving on to the second ground, it is argued that the judge  failed  to
    give sufficient reasons for deciding that there was a medium risk of re-
    conviction.

31. We start by examining the professional reports which dealt, inter alia,
    with the appellant's  risk  of  serious  harm  and  likelihood  of  re-
    conviction. The earliest report, dated 11 June 2014, was  prepared  for
    the Criminal Casework Directorate. This somewhat brief report indicated
    that it was "not known" whether the appellant had previous  convictions
    in other countries; assessed the risk of serious harm as low and stated
    that there was also a low likelihood  of  re-conviction.  It  is  worth
    mentioning that the author  of  the  report  appeared  to  have  little
    information about the appellant. As can be seen  from  page  6  of  the
    report, the author could not say with certainty that the appellant  had
    no previous convictions in the United Kingdom; there was no up to  date
    information  on  the  accommodation  likely  to   be   available;   the
    appellant's education,  training  or  employability;  whether  drug  or
    alcohol misuse was an issue and was not assisted by the  fact  that  an
    OASYs report had not been completed. There  was  also  no  pre-sentence
    report completed prior to sentencing. The author's clinical  assessment
    was that if the appellant should seek employment in households  in  the
    future she presented a "raised risk of re-offending."

32. The first OASys report dated 18 July 2014, based on an  interview  with
    the appellant, concluded that her risk of re-conviction was low. It  is
    notable that the appellant denied having  carried  out  the  series  of
    thefts, stated that she was appealing both conviction and sentence  and
    any remorse related only to the fact that  she  had  not  declared  her
    earnings.

33. At the same time, the author of this  report  commented  at  2.14  that
    while there was no serious risk of harm to the public, "as the offences
    were committed over a period of time and  in  different  locations  the
    possibilities of a continuation of offending is more likely than not."

34. The National Probation Service Progress Report of 11 December 2014 does
    not address the issue of risk but was based on an  interview  with  the
    appellant's daughter in relation to her own circumstances including her
    caring responsibilities.

35. The most up to date evidence of risk before the  judge  was  the  OASys
    assessment dated 4 November 2015. In that report, it is said  that  the
    appellant continued to deny responsibility for  the  thefts,  blame  an
    individual to whom she had given her identity card and explain that she
    only  pleaded  guilty  on  the  advice  of  her  solicitor.  The  words
    attributed to the appellant in the report at 2.8, 2.11,  7.5  and  12.8
    show that her position was now that she was  apologetic  for  the  poor
    judgment she showed in lending her identification and was accepting  of
    her punishment despite  not  being  responsible  for  the  thefts.  The
    assessment of risk of serious harm and re-conviction was also  assessed
    as being low.







36. The judge gave a number of reasons for departing from  the  conclusions
    of the professionals. Firstly, at [67], the judge expresses his concern
    that the appellant does not accept her guilt. Secondly, he found her to
    be manipulative and willing to put forward differing positions to  suit
    her purposes. At this juncture, it is useful to look at what the  judge
    said at [62] when assessing the  appellant's  oral  evidence.  Here  he
    notes that the appellant's original defence had been to  blame  another
    for the series of thefts, but that this "had been abandoned  after  the
    police had carried out further identification procedures." Furthermore,
    he refers to the fact that the sentencing judge considered the evidence
    against the appellant to be "overwhelming." Thirdly,  the  judge  notes
    that the offending continued over a long period of  time.  Indeed,  the
    first OASys reports refers to the offending spanning  eighteen  months.
    Fourthly, the judge took into  consideration  the  temptation  for  the
    appellant to resume offending if things went badly financially.

37. In view of the fact that the OASys reports mention the  difficulty  the
    appellant will face in finding employment in view of  her  convictions,
    as well as her poor level of spoken  English,  there  was  no  evidence
    before the judge to suggest that there had been any improvement in  the
    appellant's financial circumstances since the offences were  committed.
    We consider the reasons given by the judge were more than sufficient to
    explain his departure from the professional opinions expressed  in  the
    reports before him.

38. Mr � Ceallaigh's submissions in relation to the delay  in  promulgation
    failed to indicate any link between that and the judge's  findings.  As
    we indicated during the hearing, the decision and reasons  appeared  to
    have been sent for typing on 4 January  2016,  which  is  a  period  of
    approximately two months after the hearing, well within the three-month
    rule of thumb referred to in Sambasivam.  It  was  not  contended  that
    there were any errors of fact in relation to the judge's  findings.  We
    find there to be no substance to this ground.

39. Ground four took issue with the judge's reference to MA (Pakistan).  It
    was said that the judge failed to address the submission  made  on  the
    appellant's behalf, to the effect that this case was not relevant to an
    EEA case. This argument does not take into consideration what the judge
    said at [70];

    "I accept, of course, that this was not in the context of an EEA  case.
    It was not considering the  effects  of  the  Regulations.  Nonetheless
    (Elias J) was expressly considering what is a low risk when looking  at
    the future behaviour of the offender. That is, of course, the task that
    I must undertake in this case."

40. There  is  nothing  objectionable  in  the  judge's  self-direction  in
    relation to MA (Pakistan). This ground of appeal is misconceived.

41. We find that the First-tier Tribunal Judge Mayall made no errors of law
    and, accordingly, uphold his decision.





Conclusions


The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is upheld.
