Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss J Fisher, Counsel instructed by Duncan Lewis &
Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Liberia born on 1st October 1976  and  he
    appealed against a decision made by the respondent on 2nd October  2013
    to refuse him a residence card as confirmation of a right to reside  in
    the United Kingdom. In  order  to  qualify  for  a  retained  right  of
    residence following divorce from an EEA  national  in  accordance  with
    Regulation  10(5)  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  the
    respondent requested

      a. evidence that his EEA former spouse was  exercising  free  movement
         rights in the United Kingdom at the time of the divorce;

      b. evidence that his marriage lasted for three years and that  he  and
         his former spouse resided in the United Kingdom for  at  least  one
         year during the marriage and

      c. Evidence that he was in employment, self-employment or economically
         self-sufficient as if he were  an  EEA  national  at  the  date  of
         divorce.

 2. The appellant produced a decree absolute issued by the  United  Kingdom
    on 16th May 2007 and it was accepted  that  the  marriage  to  the  EEA
    national was dissolved.

 3. The respondent specifically stated that further to Regulation 10(6) the
    appellant needed to provide evidence that since the date of his divorce
    he had been a worker, self-employed or self-sufficient.  He supplied an
    employment letter dated 30th July 2010 which evidenced that he  was  in
    employment for the period from 4th June 2007 to 4th April 2008  but  he
    had provided no further evidence. The respondent  also  challenged  the
    fact that the appellant produced no evidence  of  how  the  EEA  former
    spouse was exercising her treaty rights at the date of the divorce.

 4. The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Geraint Jones QC,  who
    dismissed  the  appeal  and  who  in  the  course  of  his  preparation
    criticised the lax preparation of the case.

 5.  The  appellant's  representatives  filed  a   permission   to   appeal
    application which confirmed  that  the  only  question  on  appeal  was
    whether the appellant qualified as a worker.  It was pointed out he had
    suffered serious mental health issues that had led to homelessness  and
    a period of time in hospital.  His mental health  issues  coupled  with
    homelessness  should  be  seen  as  difficult  circumstances.   It  was
    asserted that  the  judge  dismissed  the  appeal  and  made  erroneous
    findings  and  drew  conclusions  that  were  simply  unrealistic   and
    unacceptable and showed little understanding of the appellant's serious
    mental health issues.

 6. Specific criticism was made that the judge referred  to  the  appellant
    having been convicted in 2009 when this was not the case and  that  the
    judge referred to a spouse visa being granted  'possibly  erroneously'.
    This affected the judge's approach.

 7. Further criticism of  the  judge  was  made  at  paragraph  20  of  his
    determination where he stated that he could  not  understand  when  the
    appellant referred to "I was working with ASAP", quite what  was  meant
    by "during this time".  Miss Fisher points out that there was a  letter
    from ASAP showing that the appellant was working between 4th June  2007
    and 4th April 2008 and that there was nothing opaque about that.

 8. Miss Fisher also challenged further references within the determination
    to the appellant's itinerant lifestyle and the lack of  notes  attached
    to the consultant psychiatrist's report.  These were medical notes  and
    the psychiatrist had sight of them but  it  was  not  the  job  of  the
    psychiatrist to set out each and every single day  that  the  appellant
    was fit for work.  Further the judge's findings that the appellant  had
    no intention of finding work were not borne out by the witness evidence
    of Mrs O'Connell.

 9. At the hearing before me Miss  Fisher  agreed  that  the  question  was
    whether the appellant had  retained  rights  as  at  the  date  of  his
    divorce.  She contended that  in  fact  he  could  be  construed  as  a
    qualified person as at that date which was 16th May  2007.   He  had  a
    period in hospital between 18th December 2006 and 23rd January 2007 but
    he was able to work outside that period.  Indeed he was on the books of
    ASAP for one year.  The fact that he was  ill  did  not  mean  that  he
    ceased being a worker further to Regulation 6(2)(a).   Further  to  FMB
    (EEA Regulations - reg 6(2)(a) - 'temporarily unable to  work')  Uganda
    [2010] UKUT 447 (IAC) it did not matter how minimum the wage was,  even
    a part-time worker could be protected. and if any illness was temporary
    if it was not permanent.   Alternatively, the appellant could make  use
    of Regulation 5(3).  The broad position was that  the  EEA  Regulations
    should not be interpreted restrictively.  The appellant at the relevant
    time had been registered with an  agency.   The  judge  had  failed  to
    consider the records post-2008 which indicated that he was a worker.

10. Mr Melvin submitted that the appeal was to be considered in  the  light
    of the fact that it was up to the appellant to show that he was  within
    the EEA Regulations.   It  was  difficult  to  see  from  the  evidence
    produced that the appellant could bring himself within the Regulations.
     The HMRC records had not been produced beyond 2008.  The question  was
    whether at all material times he was a worker  and  he  had  not  shown
    this.  The rest of the grounds were not relevant.

Conclusions

11. It is clear from Regulation 10(6) that the appellant must show that  at
    the date of termination of his divorce that he "would if he were an EEA
    national be a worker,  a  self-employed  person  or  a  self-sufficient
    person under Regulation 6".  The judge found at paragraphs  24  and  26
    that the appellant was not engaged  in  employment  or  in  the  labour
    market since mid-May 2005.  He stated that there was

         "quite literally, no evidence of  him  ever  seeking  work  and  so
         properly being characterised as a jobseeker.  I do not  accept  the
         appellant's evidence that he worked for  no  remuneration  for  the
         organisation described merely as 'ASAP'.  I am prepared  to  accept
         that he may have done three weeks' work in about  May  2005  but  I
         find as a fact that he has done  no  remunerated  work  since  that
         time; nor has he had any intention of doing so."

12. The fact is, however, that the letter from ASAP dated  30th  July  2010
    confirmed that the appellant was employed as a  road  sweeper  for  the
    London Borough of Hounslow as at 4th June 2007 to 4th  April  2008  and
    the judge referred to this letter but stated that  he  did  not  accept
    that the appellant would work for no remuneration.  The appellant  also
    states in his witness statement that he was working in the  early  part
    of 2007 for the Big Bus Company and then worked as a bus  surveyor  and
    thereafter for ASAP recruitment agency from June 2007.  There  were  no
    tax records to support this contention  and  the  deficiencies  in  the
    evidence were addressed by the judge but I accept that the judge should
    have taken into account the letter from  ASAP.   This  letter  and  the
    working period, post dated the date of divorce in May 2007.

13. The judge  was  critical  of  the  presentation  of  the  evidence  but
    nonetheless I find that the failure to include or attribute  weight  to
    the ASAP letter in his  assessment  of  the  appellant's  case  was  an
    omission which constitutes an error of low.  It  was  unfortunate  that
    the judge made reference to a conviction and some  irrelevant  comments
    but the key question was the nature of  the  evidence  to  support  the
    appellant's contention that he was a worker and the judge found this to
    be deficient following the divorce.

14. I find and error of law and set aside the decision save that I preserve
    the findings in respect of the marriage  and  the  appellant's  ex-wife
    exercising treaty rights.  In  essence  the  judge  accepted  that  the
    marriage had lasted for three years and the appellant and  his  ex-wife
    had lived together for one year thereby satisfying Regulation 10(5).

15. The further question was whether the appellant could be construed as  a
    qualifying EEA national  further  to  Regulation  10(6)  following  his
    divorce. The  evidence  of  the  appellant  in  his  witness  statement
    indicated that he was working prior to his divorce and the ASAP  letter
    confirmed that he was working as a road sweeper for the London  Borough
    of Hounslow.  I do not accept that he would be doing  this  through  an
    agency for nothing.  There were no tax records produced but in view  of
    the appellant's mental  health  this  was  perhaps  understandable  and
    indeed there were not records produced to show that  he  did  not  earn
    during this period.

16. The appellant had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and had a  hospital
    admission between 18th December 2006 and 23rd January 2007 but  despite
    this was able to work. I accept that intervening  periods  during  this
    time of being unable to work could be protected under  Regulation  6(2)
    whereby,

         'a person who is no longer working shall not cease to be treated as
         a worker  for  the  purpose  of  paragraph  (1)(b)  if  (a)  he  is
         temporarily unable to work as the result of an illness or accident'



    Thus following FMB where a person's inability  or  incapacity  was  not
    permanent it should be regarded as temporary.  It does not appear  that
    there is a time limit. In FMB the Tribunal held that

         'A finding of temporary inability to work for  an  extended  period
         would not be sustainable if a person having given up work owing  to
         illness then abstained from working voluntarily.  The  evidence  in
         this appeal however shows the claimant's father to have been unable
         to work until such time as developments in medication together with
         new  combinations  of  medication  stabilised  and   relieved   his
         condition sufficiently to enable him to commence his studies'

17. The reason for the appellant's  erratic  working  since  2007  was  his
    psychiatric difficulties in the form of  paranoid  schizophrenia.   The
    evidence recorded was that he would find it  difficult  to  work  under
    pressure. I do not  find  that  he  abstained  from  work  voluntarily.
    Indeed he was clearly willing and did work  after  his  hospital  spell
    from 2006 to 2007.

18. I accept that the medical evidence  including  that  of  the  Community
    Mental health nurse and the report of Dr Klemperer indicates  that  the
    spell off work, particularly to 2010 was 'temporary'.  It appears  that
    the appellant's last stay in hospital came to an end on 4th June  2010.
    The appellant gave evidence in his witness statement that he worked  in
    the community but did not give evidence in his statement  that  he  had
    been seeking work or had worked post 2010.  I  accept  that  there  was
    evidence  that  the  appellant  worked  to  4th  April  2008  and   was
    hospitalised at Gordon Hospital from 3rd  November  2009  to  4th  June
    2010.  It was submitted that there were tax records showing  he  earned
    �1,883.08 from  2009/10  and  �3,572.68  in  2010/2011.   In  fact  the
    employer reference is 267/ESA500 indicating that this was a  government
    reference and in fact income from Employment  and  Support  Allowances.
    Indeed the appellant's witness statement indicates that he did not work
    after 2008.  Even if I am incorrect about this I find that  his  period
    of inactivity between 2008  and  2010  can  be  explained  through  his
    illness and was temporary and involuntary and therefore his status as a
    worker is protected under Regulation 6(2).

19. The appellant entered the  United  Kingdom  with  his  spouse  on  10th
    January 2004.  There was evidence from Harte Hanks that the appellant's
    ex wife was employed by that firm  as  an  Account  Manager  from  27th
    September 2004.  I conclude that the appellant's ex wife was exercising
    treaty rights from her  period  of  entry  into  the  UK  and  thus  by
    extension the appellant has too been living in accordance with the  EEA
    regulations  since  entry  into  the  UK.  I  also  conclude  from  the
    appellant's own employment records produced  that  he  can  demonstrate
    (from the ASAP letter) that at the time of  his  divorce  he  could  be
    construed as a worker under regulation 6(2).  From April 2008 until and
    discharge in June 2010 I accept that he was temporarily unable to work.
     I find that his admission in November 2009 indicates his ill health in
    the previous year.  From the state of his health I do not  accept  that
    the appellant voluntarily elected not to work. However by January  2010
    he would have, with his retained  rights  of  residence  achieved  five
    years residence in the UK in accordance with the EEA Regulations  (Amos
    [2011] EWCA Civ 552) and is entitled to a permanent right of residence.



20. At the date of his divorce Regulation 5(3) would not have assisted  him
    but following his last spell in hospital (as it appears he did not work
    after 2010), I find that he could be assisted  by  Regulation  5(3)  as
    this period, which commenced in 2010, post dated  his  divorce  and  he
    could be categorised as a worker who has ceased activity. Under 5 (3)

         A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if-
         (a) he terminates his activity in the United Kingdom as a worker or
         self-employed person
         as a result of a permanent incapacity to work; and
         (b) either-
         (i) he resided in the United Kingdom continuously for more than two
         years prior to the termination;

21. I therefore allow the appellant's appeal under the EEA Regulations.

22. I also turn to a consideration of the human rights aspect. I find  that
    the appellant  can  claim  residence  under  the  EEA  Regulations  and
    therefore the Immigration Rules are not applicable.  Nonetheless I find
    that he has established a family life and private life in the  UK.   He
    retains contact with his son and has regular  mental  health  treatment
    for his schizophrenia.  He has been in the UK now for  10  years.   The
    threshold for engaging Article 8 is low.  I find that the  decision  to
    remove the appellant is not in accordance with the law.   The  question
    of proportionality does not therefore arise.

Decision

The Judge erred materially for the reasons  identified.   I  set  aside  the
decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals   Courts   and
Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007) and remake the decision under section  12(2)
(b) (ii) of the TCE 2007

I allow the appeal under the EEA Regulations and on human rights grounds.
