             In the matter of an application for judicial review

                       The Queen on the application of

                                Binyan Hagos

                                      v

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department

        Before Mr Justice McCloskey, President of the Upper Tribunal
                      and Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor



  On this application for judicial review and  following  consideration  of
  the documents lodged by the parties and having heard  Mr  A  Gilbert  (of
  Counsel), instructed by  Laurence  Lupin  Solicitors  on  behalf  of  the
  Applicant and Mr Z Malik (of Counsel) instructed by the Government  Legal
  Department on behalf of  the  Respondent  at  hearings  conducted  on  14
  January and 14 April 2015

   1) While the Maltese system for the reception, processing  and  treatment
      of asylum seekers has certain frailties and shortcomings,  these  fall
      measurably  short  of   fundamental   failings   or   near   collapse,
      particularly in circumstances where the consistent  trend  is  one  of
      progressive improvement and fortification. It suffers from no systemic
      deficiency.

   2) The transfer of a young male adult in  good  physical  health,  though
      suffering from mental health problems and asserting a risk of suicide,
      from the United Kingdom to Malta under the Dublin Regulation will  not
      necessarily violate Article 3 ECHR,  Articles  18  or  47  of  the  EU
      Charter of Fundamental Rights, Article 33 of the Refugee Convention or
      the Qualification Directive.


   3) (Per curiam) The removal of a  person  to  another  state  contravenes
      Article 5 ECHR only if the evidence  establishes  a  real  risk  of  a
      flagrant breach of this provision.

  I  INTRODUCTION


     1. The Applicant  is  a  national  of  Eritrea,  aged  27  years.   His
        application for judicial review was the subject  of  a  "rolled  up"
        direction by Upper Tribunal Judge O'Connor, dated 06  October  2014.
        The proceedings have evolved since they were initiated, in May 2014.
          Initially,  the  target  of  the  Applicant's  challenge  was  the
        Respondent's decision of 01 April 2014  certifying  the  Applicant's
        asylum claim on third country  and  clearly  unfounded  grounds,  in
        tandem with the subsequent, associated making of removal  directions
        dated 08 May 2014.  The proceedings have proved to be  organic  and,
        in their subsequent evolution, a further decision of the Respondent,
        dated 07 January 2015, has overtaken the initial  decisions  and  is
        now the new target of the Applicant's  amended  challenge.   By  the
        terms of its  most  recent,  updated  decision  the  Respondent  has
        affirmed her initial decision.


     2. We summarise the history in the following way:

             a) The Applicant avers that in 2002  he  and  his  family  left
                Eritrea due to persecution by the authorities on account  of
                their Protestant Christian faith.


             b) Between 2002 and 2011 the Applicant lived in Sudan.  He left
                this country and travelled to Libya because, he avers, those
                without a work permit were being pursued by the authorities.




             c) In February 2012, when he was attempting to leave  Libya  by
                boat, he was arrested and detained subsequently for 20 days.




             d) On 26 June 2012, having escaped from custody,  he  travelled
                on a boat which had Italy as its  destination  but,  due  to
                fuel shortage, did not proceed beyond the island of Malta in
                the Mediterranean Sea.


             e) On 26 August 2012 the Applicant's fingerprints were taken by
                the Maltese authorities.


             f) During the entirety of his sojourn in Malta,  the  Applicant
                was detained in a detention centre, in the course  of  which
                he spent around one month in a mental health hospital.


             g)  On  19  December  2013  the  Applicant  was  released  from
                detention and given temporary accommodation.  Due mainly  to
                the intolerable conditions he  left  and  travelled  to  the
                United Kingdom via Italy and France.


             h) On 04 March 2014 he arrived in the United Kingdom,  claiming
                asylum.


             i) On 13 March 2014 the Respondent formally requested Malta  to
                accept  responsibility  for   the   determination   of   the
                Applicant's asylum claim, in accordance with the Dublin  III
                Regulation.  On 01 April  2014  Malta  was  deemed  to  have
                accepted such responsibility and on 10 April 2014 it did  so
                formally.


             j) On 01 April 2014 the Respondent  certified  the  Applicant's
                case  under  Part  2  of  Schedule  3  to  the  Asylum   and
                Immigration (Treatment of Claimants etc) Act 2004.


             k) Representations opposing the Applicant's  removal  to  Malta
                were then made by his solicitors.  By letter  dated  05  May
                2014 the Respondent, relying particularly on  the  decisions
                in NS v SSHD, Cases  C-411/10  and  C/493/10  and  R  (EM  -
                Eritrea)  v  SSHD  [2014]  UKSC  12  conveyed  its  decision
                certifying the Applicant's human  rights  claim  as  clearly
                unfounded under the aforementioned statutory regime.


             l) On  08  May  2014  the  Respondent  decided  to  remove  the
                Applicant to Malta and directions were made for this to take
                place on 19 May 2014.


             m) On 16 May 2014 this  application  for  judicial  review  was
                initiated.


             n) By order of Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede dated 23 June  2014,
                permission was refused on the papers.


             o) Pursuant to the Applicant's request for oral renewal of  his
                permission  application,  Upper  Tribunal   Judge   O'Connor
                ordered, on 06 October 2014, that a "rolled up"  hearing  be
                convened.


             p) On 07 October 2014 further representations on behalf of  the
                Applicant were made to the Respondent.


             q) On 29 October 2014 the Applicant's  further  representations
                were rejected by a further decision of the Respondent.


             r) The Applicant then sought to amend his grounds of challenge.


             s) The Respondent's response was to  file  revised  grounds  of
                defence, accompanied  by  a  supplementary  decision  letter
                dated 07 January  2015  which,  in  effect,  maintained  the
                original decision, albeit this  became  the  new,  operative
                decision.


             t)  The  Tribunal  subsequently  granted  permission   to   the
                Applicant to amend his grounds.


     3.  Pursuant  to  the  evolution  and  amendments  noted   above,   the
        Applicant's case, in its reconfigured incarnation,  is  encapsulated
        in the final paragraph of his pleading in these terms:


                "Applying anxious scrutiny, it  cannot  be  said  that  [the
                Applicant's]  claim  is  'clearly  unfounded',  or  that  no
                rational  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  could  conclude  that
                removal to Malta was without a real risk  of  harm  to  [the
                Applicant] and/or a denial of his fundamental rights ie that
                the claim fails to show  a  single  'legitimate  view'  upon
                which a Tribunal might consider this mentally  ill  claimant
                faced a real risk."


         We shall examine the particulars and outworkings  of  this  omnibus
         pleading infra.


  II. THE EVIDENCE SUMMARISED


     4. Focusing firstly on the Applicant's  condition  and  traits,  it  is
        convenient  to  begin  with  the  report  of  Professor  Katona,   a
        Consultant Psychiatrist, which  was  commissioned  for  medico-legal
        purposes in the course of these proceedings and is dated 25 November
        2014.  It is appropriate to preface this with certain excerpts  from
        the Applicant's statement, dated 23 April 2014,  the  context  being
        the Applicant's detention in Malta  following  the  refusal  of  his
        asylum claim:


                "I was devastated and severely depressed ...  I  decided  to
                drink from bleach in an attempt to commit suicide because  I
                could not live that life any longer.  I  lost  consciousness
                and the next thing I recall  is  waking  up  in  a  hospital
                (Mater Dei Hospital) where I was treated and given some kind
                of support ..............


                When I got better I was asked whether I was going to try  to
                commit suicide and I responded that I would if they took  me
                back to detention so I was transferred  in  [sic]  a  mental
                health hospital (Mount Carmel Hospital) where I  stayed  for
                about a month ......


                I cannot go back to Malta.  I have suffered too  much  there
                .....


                I have nowhere to go, no place to  stay  in  Malta.  I  need
                support and assistance because of my  mental  health  issues
                ......"


        This witness statement is now of one year's  vintage.  There  is  no
        more recent statement.


     5. The opinion expressed in Professor Katona's report  is  based  on  a
        single interview of the Applicant, conducted on  03  November  2014,
        together with certain "subjective documents", which consisted of the
        Applicant's  statement,  the  judicial  review   claim   form,   the
        solicitor's pre-action protocol letter, the Respondent's reply,  the
        formal removal documents and the  record  of  the  asylum  screening
        interview.  The history  recounted  by  the  Applicant  included  an
        assertion that following  his  initial  detention  upon  arrival  in
        England he felt stressed and received certain unspecified medication
        which helped him to sleep.  This improvement in his sleep  continued
        and he remained physically well.  However, he felt "increasingly low
        in mood".  Following some five months in detention he was  released.
        He claimed that being unable  to  work  was  "very  stressful".   He
        reported some recent improvement  in  his  mood  following  the  re-
        establishment of contact with some friends  in  London.  He  claimed
        that if forcibly returned to Malta he would kill himself.


     6. Professor Katona diagnosed that the Applicant is suffering from Post-
        Traumatic  Stress  Disorder  ("PTSD").   The  components   of   this
        diagnosis included an assessment of  moderate  depressive  symptoms,
        severe trauma symptoms and  very  severe  distress.   The  Professor
        assessed the Applicant's suicide risk thus:

                "[His] suicide risk would be high in the UK once he had been
                informed that he was not going to be  allowed  to  stay  and
                would remain so during the removal process and once  he  was
                back in Malta or in Eritrea.  His suicide  risk  in  the  UK
                would become high if he were detained .....


                If [he] were removed to Malta  and  was  unsupervised  in  a
                detention setting then his suicide risk would be very  high.
                His suicide risk under such circumstances could  be  reduced
                to some extent if  reasonable  precautions  (such  as  close
                observation and removal of means) were taken."


        He further opined that the Applicant's suicide risk would  be  "low"
        if he were at liberty in Malta, adding  the  qualification  that  he
        would need treatment for his PTSD there.

     7. The Applicant's asylum screening interview was conducted on 05 March
        2014, with the assistance  of  an  interpreter.   We  highlight  the
        following responses to certain questions:


             a) The harm which the Applicant was  fearful  of  suffering  if
                removed from the United Kingdom was articulated as  that  of
                arrest.


             b) Eritrea was the country wherein he feared persecution.


             c) He made no mention of  Malta  when  describing  his  various
                travels and sojourns.


             d) He claimed that his fingerprints had not been taken  in  any
                other country.


             e) He asserted that he had suffered depression,  apparently  in
                Libya, but "not now" and had "issues sleeping".


             f) He stated that he had not claimed asylum previously.


             g) He claimed that he had last  seen  his  wife  in  Libya  six
                months previously.


     8. The so-called "country" evidence is reasonably voluminous and  spans
        the five year period 2009 -  2014.   The  resum�  which  follows  is
        confined to highlighting its more salient aspects,  including  those
        which received particular attention in the arguments of the parties.




     9. In a report compiled  in  April  2009,  the  charity  Medecins  sans
        Frontieres   ("MSF")   denounced   the   detention   conditions   of
        undocumented migrants and asylum applicants in Malta.  Most  of  the
        immigrants emanated from African countries  and  the  majority  were
        granted humanitarian protection by the  Maltese  authorities.   Only
        10% were granted asylum.  All  had  to  spend  months  in  detention
        before  determinations  were  made.   MSF  criticised  the  lack  of
        adequate shelter, hygiene and sanitation in  the  Maltese  detention
        centres. The organisation further complained that  access  to  fresh
        air was limited and irregular, conditions in "isolation areas"  were
        dire and the food was substandard.   The  detention  conditions  had
        adverse impacts on the physical  and  mental  health  of  detainees.
        While primary health care was available, it was very limited and the
        provision of medication was inadequate.


    10. MSF further noted that referral to secondary care involved the Mater
        Dei Hospital and the Mount Carmel Psychiatric Hospital.  However:

                "In the absence of medical personnel  in  the  centres,  the
                decision to refer someone is taken by the Detention  Service
                personnel. This happens  without  accompanying  translators,
                unless another detainee  is  capable,  available  and  given
                permission by the soldiers on shift to  act  as  translator.
                Many patients are discharged from hospital without discharge
                papers or a clear treatment plan which makes the  follow  up
                treatment in the detention centres difficult."

        The MSF report says the following of psychiatric care:


                "Detained patients who require in-patient  psychiatric  care
                are admitted to  Mount  Carmel  Psychiatric  Hospital.   All
                detained patients are admitted to a special ward  which  has
                individual cells intended only  for  detained  migrants  and
                asylum seekers and which is permanently guarded by a  police
                man.  The ward is staffed by one nurse  per  shift  from  an
                agency and not by regular hospital staff .....


                It offers no possibilities for  social  interaction  between
                patients and has no provision for any activities.   Patients
                spend long periods in solitary confinement. .....


                No external visitors are allowed without official permission
                from police headquarters ....


                Translation is not available.  As a result, the medical team
                often has a limited understanding of the patient's  history,
                symptoms and experience ...


                Consultant supervision is limited to a weekly visit."

        MSF was also critical of the arrangements  and  procedures  for  the
        assessment of vulnerable persons and the handling  of  their  cases.
        The report concluded:


                "Based  on  first  hand  experience  inside  the   detention
                centres, MSF has on several occasions expressed its concerns
                to the Maltese authorities about the unacceptable conditions
                in these centres, as well as the delays or  failure  in  the
                dispensation  of  medicines  and  inadequate  follow-up   of
                patients with infectious diseases ...


                Despite efforts made by authorities to rehabilitate  one  of
                the centres, the response is slow and totally inadequate  to
                ensure that the basic needs of migrants and  asylum  seekers
                are met .....   Conditions fall well below international and
                national standards and are detrimental to the  physical  and
                mental health of people ....   [and]   .....   compound  the
                suffering  of  people  who  have  already  fled  danger  and
                hardship in their countries of origin and who have  survived
                long and risky journeys over seas."

                [Emphasis added.]

    11. In its later "Special Report", dated July 2009, MSF  noted  that  it
        had  begun  providing  healthcare  and  psychological   support   to
        undocumented migrants and asylum seekers in Malta  in  August  2008.
        It reported the following figures: there were  more  than  2700  new
        arrivals in Malta  in  2008,  signifying  an  increase  in  previous
        figures; almost 50% originated from Somalia; between August 2008 and
        February 2009 MSF provided 3192 consultations to the  whole  cohort;
        the health care which  it  provided  in  detention  centres  was  of
        limited effect due to the seriously substandard  living  conditions;
        and about 17% of the health conditions  diagnosed  were  respiratory
        problems linked to exposure  to  cold  and  lack  of  treatment  for
        infections.  MSF was  so  concerned  about  the  "appalling"  living
        conditions in the "camps" for detained migrants  that  it  suspended
        its activities therein and publicly denounced them.  It continued to
        work in "open centres" to which successful migrant  applicants  were
        transferred.


    12. In March 2010 the Jesuit Refugee Service Malta ("JRSM"), a prominent
        religious order, renowned and  respected  universally,  published  a
        report on the conditions in which the  migrant  community  in  Malta
        existed.  It considered, inter alia,  the  Maltese  Agency  for  the
        Welfare of Asylum Seekers ("AWAS") and  the  residential  and  other
        facilities provided to migrants by this entity.   It  noted  that  a
        system  of  residential  agreements  was  in  place  and  that  such
        agreements could  be  terminated  for  various  reasons,  making  it
        extremely difficult for displaced residents to reacquire a place  in
        an AWAS open centre.  Such persons lost their funding allowance  and
        were liable to destitution.  The report noted that the allowance, in
        any event, was insufficient to  cover  basic  subsistence  costs  of
        food,  transport  and   medication.    The   report   made   various
        recommendations.


    13. In a further report published in June 2010,  the  JRSM  reported  as
        follows:


           a) There is no legal time limit on  the  detention  of  rejected
              asylum seekers and illegally staying third country  nationals
              who do not apply for asylum.  Official government policy  was
              that detention should not exceed 18 months.


           b) Of the 89 detainees  interviewed,  almost  80%  claimed  that
              their mental health had been adversely affected by detention.
               Some 65% asserted that access to appropriate  treatment  was
              unavailable.


           c)  Interviewees  also  expressed  continuing   concerns   about
              detention conditions, including hygiene and nutrition.


        Summarising, the  report  states  that  interviewees  complained  of
        increased stress, frustration, loss of appetite,  sleep  disturbance
        and  feelings   of   powerlessness.    The   report   made   various
        recommendations designed to address the mischiefs identified.

    14. Next, there is  a  report  of  Amnesty  International  ("AI")  dated
        December 2010.  This notes that under Maltese legislation any person
        who arrives irregularly receives a removal order and is  subject  to
        mandatory detention,  which  can  extend  to  18  months.   This  is
        justified by the authorities on security grounds  and  there  is  no
        alternative non-custodial measure. There  is  a  lack  of  effective
        legal remedies to challenge  detention.   Transfers  to  the  "open"
        centres  occur  after  the  maximum  detention  period  expires   or
        following the grant of some form of protection.  These  are  run  by
        AWAS (supra).  Staffing is inadequate and there are  no  medical  or
        social care workers.  There are complaints of  over  crowding,  poor
        sanitation,  lack  of  privacy  and  the  absence  of   recreational
        activities.  Accommodation in one of  the  centres  comprises  tents
        and, in another, metal  containers  or  tents.   Jointly  these  two
        centres  accommodate  over  1,000  people.   The  report   describes
        conditions as "deplorable".  The monthly  subsistence  allowance  is
        E130.00.  Employment and training opportunities are very limited.


    15. The Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of  Europe  ("COE")
        and his delegation visited Malta for three days in  March  2011  for
        the purpose of examining the reception of migrants, including asylum
        seekers, access to international protection  and  durable  solutions
        for migrants. The ensuing report echoes the various shortcomings and
        deficiencies in both detention and open centres highlighted  in  the
        earlier reports summarised  above.   The  issues  addressed  in  the
        report include  the  mandatory  detention  policy  operated  by  the
        Maltese Government:

                "The  Maltese  authorities  apply  a  policy  of   mandatory
                administrative  detention  in  respect   of   all   arriving
                migrants, including asylum  seekers.   At  least  initially,
                detention is  therefore  imposed  indiscriminately  on  all,
                including vulnerable groups of people .....


                The Immigration Act does not establish  a  maximum  duration
                for administrative detention; therefore, by  law,  detention
                is  potentially  of  an  unlimited  duration.   Since   2005
                however, the Maltese authorities have  been  implementing  a
                policy whereby migrants are detained for a maximum  duration
                of 12 months (if they have applied for asylum but  have  not
                yet received a final decision on their claims) or 18  months
                (if they have not applied for  asylum  or  if  their  asylum
                claims have been finally rejected)."

        The Commissioner formulated his concerns about this in the following
        terms:

                "Detention makes it very difficult  for  asylum  seekers  to
                obtain  documents,  which  may  be  with   the   immigration
                authorities or friends and relatives  outside  the  country.
                Many applications are initially rejected  because  they  are
                not substantiated with convincing  evidence.   However,  the
                Commissioner notes that a considerable number of  applicants
                have had their claims reviewed and been  granted  protection
                following the presentation of new evidence, which they could
                obtain after release. Detention also makes it very difficult
                for asylum seekers to lodge  appeals  within  the  two  week
                deadline prescribed  by  law.   Indeed,  the  only  way  for
                detained asylum seekers to appeal is through  the  staff  at
                the detention centres or through  visiting  non-governmental
                organisations, while the Refugee  Appeals  Board  reportedly
                often rejects appeals filed late."

        This report also  notes  the  existence  and  operation  of  another
        Maltese agency, the Office of the Refugee Commissioner  ("OCR")  and
        records that this  was  co-operating  fruitfully  with  UNHCR.   The
        Commissioner noted with pleasure  various  improvements  in  Malta's
        asylum procedures during recent years, while  highlighting  concerns
        about the mandatory detention regime,  the  absence  of  legal  aid,
        inadequately reasoned decisions by the immigration  authorities  and
        lack of access to the case file.

    16. A  report  of  the  International  Commission  of  Jurists  ("ICJ"),
        published in May 2012, expressed enduring concerns relating  to  the
        conditions and facilities in the  Safi  Barracks  Detention  Centre;
        noted that the Marsa Open  Centre  had  undergone  improvements  and
        would benefit from  further  works;  recommended  refurbishment  and
        improvement in the Hal-Far  Reception  Centre,  while  proposing  an
        alternative to this establishment; encouraged  the  construction  of
        improved  reception  centres;  and  proposed   primary   legislation
        reducing and defining the maximum periods of detention  and  linking
        same with "effective due diligence in deportation procedures".   Two
        further reports published in 2012, by Human  Rights  Watch  ("HRW"),
        reflected many of the  concerns  and  criticisms  noted  in  earlier
        reports digested in the foregoing paragraphs.


    17. The evidence includes several reports generated  during  2013.   The
        main themes and contents of these reports are comparable to those of
        earlier reports (summarised above) and are  somewhat  repetitive  in
        consequence. Some of the statistics noted in the Asylum  Information
        Database ("AIDA") relate to requests and transfers under the  Dublin
        II  regime  during  the  previous  year.   There  were  15  outgoing
        requests, 1003 incoming requests, two  outgoing  transfers  and  186
        incoming transfers.  This report also highlights the  automatic  and
        arbitrary detention arrangements, the inadequate  judicial  remedies
        and the limited access to a Court, including the lack of free  legal
        assistance.


    18. In June 2013 the  JRSM  published  another  report.   This  was  the
        culmination of a project designed to study the level of  fundamental
        rights protection available  to  asylum  seekers  under  the  Dublin
        Regulation  and  to  examine  the  implementation  of  the   latter.
        Information was collated  from  22  migrants,  including  returnees,
        relevant Maltese authorities and certain professionals.  The  report
        notes that since Malta is the first point of entry into the  EU  for
        the majority of asylum seekers on the island  entering  irregularly,
        few are eligible for transfer to another Member  State.   Those  who
        leave the island and are compulsorily returned at a later  date  are
        at risk of prosecution  as  their  conduct  may  have  entailed  the
        commission of a criminal offence,  such  as  travelling  with  false
        documents or escaping from lawful custody.  Such returnees are  also
        at risk of detention upon re-entry.  If their departure  from  Malta
        precedes determination of their asylum application, the  ORC  treats
        this as implicitly withdrawn.  Information  about  the  progress  of
        undetermined asylum applications becomes available only where  there
        is access to legal assistance.  JRS Malta is the only NGO  regularly
        present in detention centres providing free legal  assistance.   The
        report is critical of the sluggish procedures  for  decision  making
        under the Dublin  Regulation,  the  lack  of  clear  rules  and  the
        inadequate provision of information to applicants.


    19. For reasons which will become apparent infra, it is also appropriate
        to draw attention to a report of the Council of Europe Committee for
        the Prevention of Torture and  Inhuman  or  Degrading  Treatment  or
        Punishment ("CPT").   This report is dated July 2013 and arises  out
        of a visit to Malta between 26 and 30 September  2011.   The  issues
        addressed  in  the  report  include  conditions  at  the   Corradino
        Correctional  Facility  ("CCF"),  which  appears  to  be  the   main
        conventional prison on the island of Malta.  A  CPT  delegation  had
        previously visited Malta in May 2008, reporting  in  February  2011.
        This was the fourth such visit.  The  recommendations  included  the
        implementation of various improvements of material conditions in the
        prison, together with increased medical  and  nursing  services  and
        care.  Returning in May 2011, the CPT delegation noted a significant
        increase in the prisoner population.  It  noted  with  concern  that
        while one of the prison's "Divisions" had been renovated, many other
        recommendations for the improvement of material conditions  made  in
        2011  had  not  been  implemented.  Over-crowding,   disrepair   and
        inadequate hygiene were noted.


    20.  Whereas  the  level  of  service  provided   by   general   medical
        practitioners was unchanged, nursing services  had  improved.  There
        had  been  a  slight  increase  in  the  hours  of   attendance   by
        psychiatrists  and  psychologists.   The  CPT  recommended   further
        improvements in these  services.  It  criticised  the  Mount  Carmel
        Hospital regarding the specific case of a 21 year old  mentally  ill
        prisoner who had been discharged from hospital to a "suicide  watch"
        cell in the prison.  The report describes health care facilities  in
        the prison as "generally of a good standard".   It  notes  that  new
        inmates receive medical assessment within 24 hours of arrival.   The
        report recommends renovation of the prison.


    21. The report also criticised  the  appalling  conditions  under  which
        foreign nationals were detained in the two warehouses which make  up
        Safi Barracks in Malta.   Crowded  conditions,  woefully  inadequate
        sanitary facilities and insufficient  health  care  services  ranked
        among  the  most  serious  shortcomings.   It  noted  some   limited
        improvements in the provision of psychiatric care in  the  Corradino
        Correctional Facility, together with the continued availability of a
        team of three psychologists, while highlighting various  limitations
        in these services.  It highlighted one case of a  suicidal  detainee
        inappropriately returned from Mount Carmel  Hospital  to  detention.
        Material improvements in the detention centres were noted.  However,
        conditions  in  the  two  warehouses  at  Safi   Barracks   remained
        "appalling".


    22. With specific reference to the Mount Carmel Hospital, the CPT report
        expressed "serious misgivings" about the management of agitated  and
        suicidal patients.  Improvements in the forensic ward, in particular
        access to outdoor exercise yards and equipment, were noted.  On  the
        other hand, the ward had  become  overcrowded.   In  the  "irregular
        migrants ward", living conditions were described as "far  below  any
        acceptable standard and can only be considered as anti-therapeutic".
         The design and facilities of the ten cells  were  considered  "ante
        diluvian".  There was no access to fresh air or outdoor exercise. As
        regards  the  detention  centres  generally,  the  CPT   recommended
        significant  increases  in  the  medical   and   nursing   services,
        comprehensive medical screening of all newly arrived detainees,  the
        regular attendance of a psychiatrist  and  a  psychologist  and  the
        prompt dispensing of medicines.  The  report  further  records  that
        there had been no change in the governing statutory framework.


    23. The proliferation of reports which  materialised  around  this  time
        included one prepared by the UNCHR,  published  in  September  2013.
        This report, in common with many of its predecessors, highlights the
        operation of the Immigration Act of Malta whereby the administrative
        detention provisions apply automatically to asylum  seekers  in  the
        same way as they affect irregular migrants.  Maltese law contains no
        guarantees to ensure compliance  with  Article  31  of  the  Refugee
        Convention, which provides for the non-penalisation of refugees  who
        enter or stay illegally in the country of refuge.  UNHCR opines that
        avenues to effectively challenge the detention of asylum seekers are
        inadequate and criticises the inefficacy of  the  bail  system.   It
        suggests that the prevailing law and practice in Malta fails to give
        effect to the fundamental right  to  liberty  and  security  of  the
        person  enshrined  in  international  and  European   human   rights
        instruments.  The report urges Maltese policy makers and legislators
        to develop the country's reception  system  so  as  to  give  proper
        effect to international refugee and human rights law standards.  The
        report contains  a  considered  analysis  of  the  relevant  Maltese
        legislation, namely the Immigration Act and the Refugees Act.


    24. One month later, in October 2013, the  European  Commission  against
        Racism and Intolerance ("ECRI"),  published  its  report  concerning
        Malta.  ECRI operates under the auspices of the Council of Europe as
        an independent human rights monitoring body specialised  in  matters
        of racism and intolerance.  The  organisation  had  published  three
        previous reports on Malta, the last dated April 2008.   The  October
        2013  report  notes  subsequent  progress  in  a  number  of  areas,
        including new criminal law provisions, several training initiatives,
        the creation of a Migrant Health Unit, the incorporation in  Maltese
        law of subsidiary protection and the principle  of  non-refoulement,
        improvements in the material and living conditions at the Marsa Open
        Reception Centre and advances in the climate of public  opinion  and
        discourse regarding migrants, asylum seekers and refugees.  However,
        concerns were expressed about the continuing automatic detention  of
        asylum seekers and irregular migrants, the length of  detention  and
        the lack of  access  to  a  court  for  appeal  or  judicial  review
        following  exhaustion  of  the  first  and  second  instance  appeal
        mechanisms.  ECRI doubted the claims of the Maltese authorities that
        the appellate body, the  Refugee  Appeals  Board  ("RAB"),  has  the
        status of an independent judicial authority.   Finally,  the  report
        echoes the concerns expressed by other agencies about conditions  in
        detention centres.


    25. Pausing to take stock,  while  there  is  an  abundance  of  reports
        generated during 2013, the evidence contains only one  2014  report.
        This is another report of AIDA, published  in  May  2014.   Notably,
        JRSM is one of the main contributors to this report, which  develops
        the most recent update provided in January 2014. It notes  that  the
        Safi Barracks warehouses have been closed  for  refurbishment.   The
        other immigration detention facilities,  totalling  two,  remain  in
        use, accommodating some 500 detainees.  During the  year  2013  some
        1900 persons had been detained there from time to time.   The  other
        main features of this report are the following:

             a) The time limit of two weeks  for  appealing  first  instance
                asylum  decisions  to  the  RAB,  with  no   provision   for
                extension, continues to apply.


             b) The first instance decision is always  written  in  English,
                which may constitute an obstacle for some asylum applicants.


             c) The lack of clear and established procedures for pursuing an
                appeal continues and the standard appeal notices may not  be
                readily available to everyone.


             d) Recent trends include increased oral hearings  held  by  the
                RAB and a significant increase in successful appeals.


             e) It is possible to challenge decisions of the RAB by judicial
                review, which does not encompass a challenge to  the  merits
                of the asylum decision.


             f) A limited  number  of  lawyers  working  with  NGOs  provide
                information and legal advice to  asylum  applicants.   While
                free legal assistance is  available  at  the  appeal  stage,
                there are some restrictions on access to the case  file  and
                consultation with the appellant.


             g) The risk of prosecution of those who left Malta  irregularly
                and are returned there continues, entailing  remand  custody
                during the whole of the criminal proceedings,  access  to  a
                legal aid lawyer and a  maximum  imprisonment  term  of  two
                years.

    26. It is appropriate to interpose  here  a  recent  piece  of  evidence
        emanating  from  the  JRSM.   This  consists  of  an  email  from  a
        representative of this organisation to  the  Applicant's  solicitors
        stating, with reference to the Applicant:


                "He arrived on June 26 2012, was issued with a removal order
                as per standard  practice  and  detained.   He  applied  for
                asylum but his application was rejected at  first  instance.
                According to our records, he did not  file  an  appeal  from
                this decision.  He was therefore held in  detention  for  18
                months.  While in detention he had medical problems and  was
                also admitted to  Mount  Carmel  Hospital,  the  psychiatric
                hospital, for a short period of  time.  We  do  not  have  a
                record of the reason for admission .......


                The conditions in Warehouse, where he was detained for  some
                months, and in the ward at Mount Carmel  Hospital  are  very
                much as he describes them."

        Juxtaposing  this  with  other  evidence,  it  seems  likely   that
        "Warehouse"  denotes  the  immigration  detention  centre  at   Safi
        Barracks.  This communication continues:


                "At this point he would not be returned to detention  if  he
                were to be returned to Malta, however he would  very  likely
                face prosecution for leaving Malta in an  irregular  manner.
                If he is prosecuted he  could  very  well  face  a  term  of
                imprisonment."

        In the  pre-action  protocol  letter,  the  Applicant's  solicitors,
        clearly reflecting his instructions,  disclosed  that  he  had  been
        provided with an asylum screening form in detention,  prompting  him
        to claim asylum and resulting in an interview  which  the  Applicant
        found unsatisfactory on account of interpretation difficulties.  The
        decision on his application, which was  negative,  was  conveyed  in
        writing, by letter, albeit allegedly  without  reasons.   While  the
        Applicant was aware that he had a right of appeal,  it  was  claimed
        that he did not exercise this on account of  a  lack  of  procedural
        information and the absence of reasons.  The Applicant  was  not  in
        detention prior  to  his  departure  from  Malta:  he  was,  rather,
        accommodated in a "camp" providing temporary shelter.


    27. The evidence includes a brief report of the Human Rights Council  of
        the  United  Nations  General  Assembly,  dated  March  2014.   This
        contains  the  response  of  the  Maltese  Government   to   earlier
        recommendations.   Under  the  rubric  "Protecting  the  Rights   of
        Migrants, Refugees and Asylum Seekers", the Government  states  that
        maintenance and refurbishment at the various  Detention  Centres  is
        "continuously being conducted".   It  noted  the  deployment  of  EU
        funding for certain works and initiatives.  The response continues:


                "Persons  who  have  been  detained  are  given  a  pamphlet
                informing them of their rights.  They are also informed that
                they have a right to appeal their removal  order  and  their
                detention order and that they  are  entitled  to  apply  for
                asylum.  Asylum seekers are also assisted  by  interpreters,
                provided by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner."


        Regarding medical care, the response states:


                "Medical checks are systematically  carried  out  for  every
                immigrant upon arrival and vulnerable migrants are  provided
                with  alternative  accommodation  as  well  as  any  special
                attention they may require, such as health care."


        With regard to the duration of detention:


                "Most asylum applications are determined at  first  instance
                within six months or less, which  means  that  most  genuine
                asylum seekers are not detained for  more  than  six  months
                ....


                Vulnerable asylum seekers are not subject to  the  detention
                requirement."


        Finally, the introduction of further safeguards is addressed:


                "Additional  safeguards  to  be   introduced   by   way   of
                transposition of the recast Reception  Conditions  Directive
                will further contribute towards ensuring that asylum seekers
                will not  be  detained  more  than  is  strictly  necessary.
                Implementation   of   this   Directive   will   entail   the
                introduction of free legal aid in the context of challenging
                detention.  Free  legal  aid  at  asylum  appeals  stage  is
                already available."


        [Emphasis added.]


        This is a reference to state funded legal aid.


    28. The Applicant also  relies  on  the  following  pieces  of  evidence
        relating to repatriation attempts by the Maltese authorities:

           a) In 2004, two Somali nationals were  forcibly  repatriated  by
              the Maltese authorities to Libya, where they were beaten  and
              tortured.  Ultimately, the men managed  to  return  to  Malta
              where, in legal proceedings, the Constitutional Court found a
              breach of Article 3 ECHR.


           b) In 2010, four migrants were returned,  apparently  summarily,
              to Libya.


           c) In the same year, a Maltese military  vessel  intercepted  55
              Somalia nationals travelling from Libya, escorting 28 of them
              to Malta and shipping the other 27 to Libya where  they  were
              reportedly beaten and tortured.


           d) There is also a brief AI Report describing incidents  related
              to disagreements between Malta and Italy in 2013.


        The Applicant  relies  on  the  above  evidence  in  an  attempt  to
        establish that if he is returned to Malta he  will  be  at  risk  of
        refoulement.


  III THE APPLICANT'S CASE


    29. Our understanding of the main  links  in  the  interesting  argument
        developed by Mr Gilbert on behalf of the Applicant  is  as  follows.
        Article 18 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights  ("the  Charter")
        creates an individual, enforceable right to asylum.   The  Applicant
        has been denied the exercise of this right in  Malta  by  reason  of
        shortcomings in the asylum claims process, relating particularly  to
        the absence of free legal assistance, at  first  instance,  adequate
        information and a reasoned decision.   As  a  result,  the  decision
        refusing his asylum claim in Malta contravenes Articles 18 and 47 of
        the Charter.  Recognising that under Maltese law it will be open  to
        the Applicant to make a fresh asylum claim if returned there, or  to
        seek a reconsideration  of  the  earlier  refusal  decision,  it  is
        further contended that there will be a serious risk  of  a  repeated
        breach of Articles 18 and 47 of the Charter. This is the first  limb
        of the Applicant's case.


    30. The second, further or alternative,  dimension  of  the  Applicant's
        challenge is that his enforced return to Malta will expose him to  a
        real  risk  of  treatment  proscribed  by  Article  3   ECHR.    The
        Applicant's case is advanced  on  two  alternative  scenarios.   The
        first is that he is likely to  be  prosecuted  for  having  departed
        Malta illegally with a resulting  conviction,  incarceration  and  a
        further transfer to the Mount Carmel  Hospital  on  account  of  his
        mental condition, thereby  exposing  him  to  the  risk  of  suicide
        described in the report of Professor Katona (see  [7]  supra).   The
        alternative scenario is that the Applicant will  not  be  prosecuted
        but will be at liberty, resulting in accommodation  in  one  of  the
        open reception centres in conditions contravening Article 3 ECHR.


    31. The Applicant's case has a further,  third  limb,  namely  that  his
        enforced return to Malta will expose him to a risk  of  refoulement,
        contrary to Articles 18 and 47 of the Charter. The principal  remedy
        sought by the Applicant is an order quashing the  impugned  decision
        of the Respondent. The Applicant also seeks a declaration  regarding
        the asserted risk of refoulement.

  IV  DISCUSSION

    32. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled against Malta in  three
        cases  during  recent  years.   The  first  is   Massoud   v   Malta
        [Application No: 24340/08], which concerned an Algerian national who
        travelled by boat from Libya to Malta as an irregular immigrant  and
        was detained thereafter in  the  Safi  Military  Barracks.   He  was
        prosecuted and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment for his  role  in
        assisting and procuring other persons to enter or attempt  to  enter
        the island.  Subsequently he applied for asylum, unsuccessfully  and
        his appeal was dismissed. He was detained throughout the entirety of
        the  asylum  process  and  remained  in  custody  for  1   �   years
        subsequently, when his removal order was withdrawn in  view  of  the
        lack of prospects of his eventual deportation.  His complaint  about
        his conditions of detention, advanced  under  Article  3  ECHR,  was
        rejected for non-exhaustion  of  domestic  remedies.   However,  the
        Court found a breach of Article 5(1) on the ground that there was no
        protection under Maltese  law  against  arbitrary  detention.   This
        judgment was delivered in July 2010.


    33. In a further judgment, promulgated in July 2013, in  Ahmed  v  Malta
        [Application No: 55352/12], the Strasbourg Court found  breaches  of
        Articles 3, 5(1) and 5(4) ECHR in a case brought by  a  national  of
        Eritrea who had fled initially to Sudan  and  then  Libya,  entering
        Malta irregularly thereafter.  Notably, the JRSM was active in  this
        Applicant's case during her detention phase, referring  her  to  the
        AWAS and being thus instrumental in an assessment by the  Vulnerable
        Adults  Assessment  Team.   Taking  into  account  the  factors   of
        overcrowding,  inadequate  ventilation,  lack  of  heat,  inadequate
        outdoor exercise, the lack of female staff and the duration  of  the
        Applicant's detention, some 15 months, the Court found  a  violation
        of Article 3 ECHR.  Reaffirming its earlier decision in Massoud, the
        Court also found breaches of Article 5(1) and (4).


    34. The third in this trilogy of Strasbourg decisions is  Musa  v  Malta
        [Application No: 42337/12], in which judgment was also given in July
        2013. Once again, the Court found a breach of Article 5(1)  and  (4)
        ECHR. The Applicant in this case was another irregular immigrant who
        was detained in Safi Barracks throughout the entirety of the period,
        12 months, during which he unsuccessfully applied  to  the  ORC  for
        asylum and failed in his ensuing  appeal  to  the  RAB.   The  total
        period of his immigration detention was some 18 months.


    35. Accordingly, to summarise, the Strasbourg Court has  found  breaches
        of Article 3 and Article 5(1) and (4) ECHR against  Malta  in  three
        successive decisions.  These decisions do not,  however,  amount  to
        sweeping, all embracing condemnations  of  the  conditions  for  the
        detention of asylum applicants in Malta and the processing of  their
        protection claims.  Rather, it is  necessary  to  be  alert  to  the
        precise, delineated and  fact  sensitive  context  of  each  of  the
        decisions.  Furthermore, regard must be had to their vintage.  It is
        also  appropriate  to  note  at  this  juncture  that  whereas   the
        Applicant's case was based partly on Article 5 ECHR  at  an  earlier
        stage, ultimately this ground of challenge was abandoned.


    36. As our summary of the evidence in  Chapter  II  above  demonstrates,
        time has not stood still on the island of Malta.  With each  passing
        year, the notional graph has been one of gradual improvement in  the
        conditions  and  processes  for  the  reception,  accommodation  and
        general treatment of asylum applicants and the processing  of  their
        protection claims.  In evaluating the evidence  digested  above,  we
        take into account that  its  sources  and  providers  are  reputable
        organisations.  We observe further that  there  was  no  significant
        challenge to this evidence on behalf of the Respondent.  Broadly, it
        is both internally and externally consistent and we propose to  give
        effect to it.  Inevitably, our  particular  focus  is  on  the  most
        recent evidence, the impact and context whereof are both shaped  and
        illuminated by the older evidence.  Having regard to the Applicant's
        challenge, summarised above, the particular focus of the Tribunal is
        on the following discrete topics:

             a) the conditions  provided  for  and  treatment  and  services
                available  to  those  in  detention  in   Malta   who   have
                psychiatric needs and requirements.


             b) the current processes and procedures for  the  consideration
                and determination of asylum applications, to  include  fresh
                applications  and  requests  for  the   reconsideration   of
                applications refused; and


             c) the possibility of  the  Applicant  being  refouled  by  the
                Maltese authorities.


    37. It is appropriate at this juncture  to  set  out  the  findings,  or
        evaluative predictive judgments, of the Tribunal upon which we  have
        identified the three issues  listed  above.   First,  having  regard
        particularly  to  the  JRSM  evidence,  which  we  find  cogent  and
        compelling, we consider that the most likely future scenario for the
        Applicant in the event of being returned to Malta  from  the  United
        Kingdom  is  prosecution  for  the  immigration  offence  which   he
        committed in departing Malta, conviction and punishment by a term of
        imprisonment of up to 18 months.  On this  scenario,  the  Applicant
        will not be treated - as he was previously - as  an  irregular  male
        immigrant who is automatically detained  and  remains  in  detention
        pending determination of his asylum application or  removal  abroad.
        He will, rather, be treated  and  processed  as  a  person  who  has
        committed an offence under Maltese law.  Taking  into  account  also
        the psychiatric evidence, this hypothesis places  the  spotlight  on
        two particular establishments on the island  of  Malta,  namely  the
        Corradino  Correctional  Facility  ("CCF")  and  the  Mount   Carmel
        Psychiatric Hospital.


    38. At this juncture we remind ourselves of the  evidence  of  Professor
        Katona, summarised in [6]  and  [7]  above.  We  consider  that  the
        Professor's assessment and opinion would have been more cogent if he
        had critically evaluated the account given by the  Applicant  during
        his asylum interview (see [8] above). Furthermore, we consider  that
        he should have acknowledged that he did not have  available  to  him
        some obviously significant  evidence,  namely  the  records  of  the
        Applicant's treatment and medication since his advent to the  United
        Kingdom  some  eight  months  previously.   We  make   the   further
        observation that, in our estimation,  consultant  psychiatrists  and
        other medical experts should almost invariably request  material  of
        this kind before finalising their reports.  We balance these factors
        against the experience and expertise of the author, the lack of  any
        conflicting psychiatric assessment and the absence of any  challenge
        to the report on behalf of the Respondent. On balance, we accept the
        Professor's  evaluation  of  the  suicide  risk  pertaining  to  the
        Applicant.


    39. The precise terms in  which  Professor  Katona  has  formulated  the
        suicide risk call for careful attention.  We have no doubt that  the
        Professor chose  his  words  with  care.  The  relevant  passage  is
        reproduced in [7] above.  Notably, Professor Katona did not link the
        Applicant's suicide risk to the issue of substandard and  inadequate
        detention conditions.  Rather, he based his opinion on detention per
        se.  He acknowledged further that this risk could  be  addressed  by
        certain measures, specifically  close  observation  and  removal  of
        means. To these measures we consider it necessary  to  add  that  of
        such psychiatric services, care and treatment as are  likely  to  be
        available to the Applicant in the scenario of incarceration  at  the
        CCF and/or transfer to the Mount Carmel Hospital.   Furthermore,  we
        consider it at least probable that Professor Katona's report will be
        made available to the relevant agencies.  We have no reason to doubt
        that the Applicant's solicitors will take appropriate steps in  this
        respect, liaising as necessary - as they have done previously - with
        JRSM.


    40. The main evidence relating to CCF is, as we have  noted  above,  the
        CPT report based on its visit and  survey  in  2011.  We  take  into
        account the vintage of this evidence, which is now  approaching  its
        fourth anniversary.  The report acknowledges improved and  increased
        nursing services, the designation of two prison officers  to  assist
        the nursing and medical professionals, the slight  increase  in  the
        hours of attendance by psychiatrists  and  the  continuing  services
        provided by forensic psychologists.  We acknowledge, of course,  the
        recommendation   that   reinforcement   of   the   psychiatric   and
        psychological services at CCF be  undertaken  swiftly.   We  do  not
        consider that the single, isolated case of the 21 year old  mentally
        ill prisoner who had been transferred to the Mount  Carmel  Hospital
        and returned to prison later,  with  advice  from  the  psychiatrist
        about appropriate anti-suicide measures,  advances  the  Applicant's
        case. On the contrary, while  noting  the  CPT's  criticism  of  the
        discharge of this prisoner from hospital, this evidence specifically
        addresses  one  of  the  recommendations  of  Professor  Katona  and
        provides grounds for the expectation that, as a minimum,  comparable
        measures  will  be  taken  vis-�-vis  the  Applicant  if  necessary.
        Furthermore, the case instanced confirms the continuing availability
        of the Mount Carmel Hospital for prisoners with  psychiatric  needs.
        Finally, while the CPT was critical of the  material  conditions  in
        the hospital's irregular  immigrant's  ward,  it  made  no  specific
        recommendations in this respect and noted certain  improvements,  in
        particular access to outdoor exercise yards and equipment.


    41. The CPT report constitutes  the  most  recent  substantial  evidence
        relating to CCF and the Mount  Carmel  Hospital.   We  have  already
        observed that there is a relative  abundance  of  reports  generated
        during  2013.   These  were  published  by  a  series  of  reputable
        organisations: UNHCR, JRSM and AIDA.  It appears to us  likely  that
        if there were any major concerns relating to the particular services
        and facilities which we are considering in  this  discrete  context,
        these would have been expressed in the  reports  in  question.    We
        graft onto this the evidence which has been provided by JRSM to  the
        Applicant's  solicitors  for   the   specific   purpose   of   these
        proceedings.  It is clear from their communication  that  they  were
        aware of the Applicant's previous admission to Mount Carmel Hospital
        for psychiatric treatment  purposes  and  were  also  alert  to  the
        suggestion that he  had  enduring  "mental  health  problems".   Our
        analysis of all the evidence  impels  to  the  conclusion  that  the
        services, facilities and treatment  available  for  the  Applicant's
        psychiatric needs will be as a minimum, those described in  the  CPT
        report.  Furthermore, we have found as a matter of probability  that
        the relevant agencies and professionals will have Professor Katona's
        report available to them.  We  consider  it  likely  also  that  the
        Applicant will engage positively with what is offered to him.


    42. On the basis of these findings and evaluative predictive  judgments,
        it is necessary to apply the appropriate legal test.  This aspect of
        the Applicant's case is based  squarely  on  Article  3  ECHR,  thus
        engaging the well established test  that  offending  treatment  must
        attain a minimum level of severity, the assessment  whereof  depends
        on all relevant circumstances such as  duration,  the  physical  and
        mental effects of the treatment and, if appropriate, the gender, age
        and state of health of the victim.  See, for example Keenan v United
        Kingdom [2001] 33 EHRR 913, at [108] - [110] where the  Court  noted
        in particular that the state has a duty to  protect  the  health  of
        detained persons and, in the case of mentally ill prisoners,  it  is
        incumbent on  the  authorities  to  take  into  consideration  their
        vulnerability.  Any failings in  the  discharge  of  this  duty  may
        amount to treatment contravening Article 3 ECHR.  See also  Ilhan  v
        Turkey [Application No 22277/93] at [87].  We acknowledge that, this
        being a so-called  "foreign"  case,  the  burden  of  proof  on  the
        Applicant is the lower one. Thus he is not required to prove  beyond
        reasonable doubt that he will be subjected to proscribed  treatment.
        Rather, he must establish substantial grounds for believing that  if
        removed to another state he faces a  real  risk  of  suffering  such
        treatment.  See, for example, Saadi  v  Italy  [2008]  ECHR  179  at
        [129].


    43. This being a Dublin Regulation  case,  we  must  also  consider  the
        leading decisions of the CJEU and the United Kingdom Supreme  Court.
        In NS and ME [2011] EUECJ C-144/10 which concerned Article 4 of  the
        Charter (the equivalent of Article 3 ECHR), the CJEU ruled at [94]:

             "..... The member states, including the national  courts,  may
             not  transfer  an  asylum  seeker   to   the   'member   state
             responsible' within the  meaning  of  Regulation  No  343/2003
             where they cannot be unaware that systemic deficiencies in the
             asylum procedure and in the  reception  conditions  of  asylum
             seekers in that member state amount to substantial grounds for
             believing that the asylum seeker would face  a  real  risk  of
             being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment  within  the
             meaning of Article 4 of the Chapter."

        See also, to like effect, [106]. The hurdles to be overcome are  not
        inconsiderable.  First, the putative transferring State must form  a
        state of mind constituted by the requirement of "substantial grounds
        for believing": a simple suspicion  or  whimsical  opinion  or  mere
        reservation will not suffice.  Second,  the  requisite  belief  must
        relate to the existence of "systemic  flaws",  ie  root  and  branch
        deficiencies and failings, in the host State.  Third, these systemic
        flaws must relate to the conditions  for  the  reception  of  asylum
        applicants  and  the   processing   and   determination   of   their
        applications. Fourth, the  systemic  flaws  must  be  of  sufficient
        gravity  to  subject  asylum  applicants  to  inhuman  or  degrading
        treatment.  All of these  hurdles  must  be  overcome  in  order  to
        successfully challenge a Dublin Regulation transfer decision.

    44. The decision in NS was applied by the United Kingdom Court of Appeal
        in   EM (Eritrea) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
        [2012] EWCA Civ 1336.  See, firstly, [46]:

             "The [CJEU] took care (paragraphs 81 - 82)  to  distinguish  a
             true systemic deficiency from 'operational problems'  even  if
             these created 'a substantial risk that asylum seekers may ....
              be treated in a manner incompatible  with  their  fundamental
             rights'."

        Second, at [47]:

             "It appears to us that what the CJEU has consciously  done  in
             NS is elevate the finding of  the  ECTHR  that  there  was  in
             effect, in Greece, a systemic  deficiency  in  the  system  of
             refugee protection into a sine qua non of intervention.   What
             in MSS was held to be a sufficient condition  of  intervention
             has been made by NS into a necessary one.  Without  it,  proof
             of individual risk, however grave, and whether or not  arising
             from  operational  problems  in  the  state's  system,  cannot
             prevent return under Dublin II."

        The Supreme Court, however, disagreed with  the  Court  of  Appeal's
        interpretation of NS.  See [58]:

             "The  Court  of  Appeal's  conclusion   that   only   systemic
             deficiencies in the listed  country's  asylum  procedures  and
             reception conditions will constitute  a  basis  for  resisting
             transfer to the listed country cannot be upheld.  The critical
             test remains that articulated  in  Soering  v  United  Kingdom
             [1989] 11 EHRR 439.  The removal of a  person  from  a  member
             state of the Council of Europe to another country is forbidden
             if it is shown that there is  a  real  risk  that  the  person
             transferred will suffer treatment contrary  to  Article  3  of
             ECHR".

        The Supreme Court was alert to the linkage between  Article  3  ECHR
        and Article 4 of the  Charter:  see  [62].   This  foreshadowed  the
        following conclusion in [63]:


             "Where, therefore, it can be  shown  that  the  conditions  in
             which an asylum seeker will be required to  live  if  returned
             under Dublin II are such that there is a  real  risk  that  he
             will be subjected  to  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment,  his
             removal to that state is forbidden."

        See [63].  This was followed by an exercise in reconciliation.   The
        Supreme  Court  recognised  that  in  an  Article  3  challenge  the
        supporting evidence would be "more likely  to  partake  of  systemic
        failings".  However -


             "...  the search for such failings is by way  of  a  route  to
             establish that there is a  real  risk  of  Article  3  breach,
             rather than a hurdle to be surmounted".

    45. While  the  Supreme  Court  was  satisfied  that  its  decision  was
        harmonious with NS - see [51] to [57] - a conundrum arises by virtue
        of the decision of the Grand Chamber in  Abdullahi  v  Bundesasylamt
        [2013] EUECJ C-394/12 (10/12/13), which was not  considered  in  the
        appeal.  There the Grand Chamber held, in [60]:


             "In such a situation, in which the Member State agrees to take
             charge of the applicant for asylum ....  the only way in which
             the applicant for asylum can call into question the choice  of
             that criterion is by pleading  systemic  deficiencies  in  the
             asylum procedure and in the conditions for  the  reception  of
             applicants for asylum  in  that  latter  Member  State,  which
             provide substantial grounds for believing that  the  applicant
             for asylum would face  a  real  risk  of  being  subjected  to
             inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 4
             of the Charter .........."


        [Emphasis added]


      There is, therefore, some  evident  disharmony  between  the  leading
        decisions of these two senior judicial organs. We consider, however,
        that  it  is  unnecessary   to   attempt   any   rapprochement,   or
        reconciliation, in the present case.


    46. At this juncture, we remind ourselves that as this is a challenge to
        a certification  decision  under  the  2004  statutory  regime,  the
        question for the Respondent in  making  the  impugned  decision  was
        whether the asserted infringement of the  Applicant's  rights  under
        Article 3 ECHR is so clearly without substance that an appeal to the
        FtT is bound to fail: see R v SSHD, ex parte Yogathas [2002]  3  WLR
        1276.  In R (L) v SSHD [2003] EWCA  Civ  25,  the  Court  of  Appeal
        formulated the test in these terms:


              "If on at least one legitimate view of the facts or  the  law
              the claim may succeed, it will not be clearly unfounded.   If
              that point is reached, the  decision  maker  cannot  conclude
              otherwise."


      We further direct ourselves that the facts of  the  Applicant's  case
        are to be evaluated at their reasonable  zenith:  EM  (Eritrea),  at
        [8].  We are also conscious that our consideration  of  the  present
        application unfolds in the  context  of  a  soi-disant  "rolled  up"
        hearing.


        Article 3 ECHR: Conclusions


    47. The focus of this aspect of the Applicant's case is the services and
        treatment which will be available to him for his  psychiatric  needs
        in the event of incarceration  following  return  to  Malta.  It  is
        contended that these facilities will be so deficient and  inadequate
        that the Article 3 ECHR threshold is overcome. Giving effect to  the
        findings  and  evaluative  predictive  assessments  which  we   have
        rehearsed above, we cannot agree.  While it may fairly be said  that
        the psychiatric services and treatment  which  will  predictably  be
        available to the Applicant fall short of the notional ideal and  may
        not emulate those of certain  first world states, including some  EU
        member states, the Article 3 threshold is an  elevated  one  and  we
        consider that it is not overcome.  We  have  taken  the  Applicant's
        case at its zenith, adopting a view of the facts pertaining  to  his
        personal history and present condition most favourable to  him.   We
        juxtapose  this  with  the  findings   and   predictive   evaluative
        assessments which we have made. Having done  so,  we  conclude  that
        there is no legitimate view of the  relevant  facts  upon  which  an
        appeal  by  the  Applicant  to  the  FtT  would  succeed.  Thus  the
        certification by the Respondent that the Applicant's Article 3 claim
        is clearly unfounded is unimpeachable.


    48. For the same reasons, we conclude that the Applicant's case does not
        satisfy the systemic deficiencies test.   This  test  too  erects  a
        difficult,  challenging  hurdle  which,   in   our   judgment,   the
        Applicant's case falls measurably short of  overcoming.   While  the
        Maltese  systems  and  arrangements  have  certain   frailties   and
        shortcomings, we  consider  that  these  fall  measurably  short  of
        fundamental failings or near collapse, particularly in circumstances
        where the consistent trend is one  of  progressive  improvement  and
        fortification.

Article 18 CFR:  Conclusions

    49. We turn to consider what we have  identified  above  as  the  second
        central element of the Applicant's challenge,  namely  a  contention
        that his enforced return to Malta would infringe  his  rights  under
        Articles 18  and  47  of  the  Charter,  having  regard  to  various
        shortcomings  in  the  Maltese  process  and  procedures   for   the
        consideration and determination of asylum claims.   The  ingredients
        of this challenge are, in brief summary, the  asserted  inadequacies
        relating to the provision of information to asylum claimants and the
        availability of free legal advice.  The Applicant also  attacks  the
        independence of the appellate  body,  the  RAB.   In  mounting  this
        discrete challenge, it was acknowledged by Mr Gilbert on  behalf  of
        the Applicant, that  the  NS  systemic  deficiencies  test  must  be
        satisfied by him.


    50. It is important to identify the likely scenario to which this aspect
        of the Applicant's challenge is directed.  The unspoken  premise  is
        that the Applicant will,  following  return,  either  make  a  fresh
        asylum application or ask for reconsideration of the extant  refusal
        decision.   We  consider  that  there  is  a  sufficient  evidential
        foundation for the suggestion that both possibilities are viable, to
        which we add that the Mr Gilbert did not argue the contrary.


    51. The Applicant's case is that  his  enforced  return  to  Malta  will
        generate a serious risk of violating his rights under Article 18  of
        the Charter.   This provides, under the rubric "Right to Asylum":

             "The right to asylum shall be guaranteed with due respect  for
             the rules of the Geneva Convention of 28  July  1951  and  the
             Protocol of 31 January 1967 relating to the status of refugees
             and in accordance with the Treaty  establishing  the  European
             Community."

        The  cornerstone  of  Mr  Gilbert's  argument  is  that  Article  18
        establishes an individual right  to  asylum.  He  also  invoked  the
        Procedures Directive (2005/85/EC).  Mr  Gilbert  appeared  to  argue
        initially that Article 18 creates something of an absolute right  to
        asylum,  to  be  contrasted  with  Article  14  of   the   Universal
        Declaration of Human Rights, which (merely) provides  that  everyone
        has the right to seek and to enjoy asylum.  However, he was disposed
        to accept  the  Tribunal's  suggestion  that  any  right  to  asylum
        established by Article 18 can only amount to a right to  be  granted
        asylum where the relevant qualifying conditions  under  the  Refugee
        Convention and Protocol are satisfied. Given this, together with the
        clear nexus, acknowledged in the argument, between  Article  18  and
        the Geneva Convention and Protocols, it is far from clear  that  the
        former confers any new or additional right of  the  kind  canvassed.
        However, without  deciding  this  issue  conclusively,  for  present
        purposes we are disposed to accept the Applicant's  contention  that
        he has a right to have his asylum claim assessed in accordance  with
        fair  and  efficient  procedures  which  include  the  provision  of
        appropriate information and legal advice and an effective remedy, as
        the UNHCR has contended in its intervention before the CJEU in Halaf
        v Bulgarian State Agency for Refugees [C-52811].

   52. Returning to the factual framework of the Applicant's case we turn to
       consider, firstly, the material facts  bearing  on  his  unsuccessful
       claim for asylum in Malta during his sojourn  there.   The  Applicant
       was clearly possessed of sufficient information to know that he could
       claim asylum and he proceeded to do so.  The processing of his  claim
       included an interview in person and the services of  an  interpreter.
       We note  the  Applicant's  reservation  about  the  quality  of  this
       particular service.  The Applicant also received a document described
       as  a  "screening  interview  form".   The  decision   refusing   his
       application was  in  writing  and  was  provided  to  him.   It  was,
       ultimately, conceded that  the  Applicant  understood  the  decision.
       Though aware of his entitlement to appeal, he did  not  pursue  this.
       He did not receive legal advice.  However, it is clear  that  he  was
       known to the JRSM, one of the NGOs which provides free  legal  advice
       to detained immigrants.  This organisation has  records  relating  to
       the Applicant, including a specific  note  that  he  did  not  appeal
       against the asylum refusal decision.  We infer from  the  information
       about the Applicant which this organisation retains  that  there  was
       direct interaction between the two of them.  We  consider  it  likely
       that this included either some legal advice or,  as  a  minimum,  the
       possibility of receiving same.  Focusing on the later stages  of  the
       process, since the Applicant did not pursue an appeal no question  of
       providing him with legal advice at that stage would have arisen.   We
       find that this would have been available had he appealed.


   53. Assuming, without deciding,  that  the  various  due  process  rights
       canvassed on behalf of the Applicant derive from Article  18  of  the
       Charter, we now turn to project future probabilities.  The contention
       we are required to determine is that the  Applicant  will,  following
       return, be denied these entitlements.  This is based on  the  premise
       that he will seek to re-open the earlier refusal decision, to  pursue
       a late appeal or to make a fresh  application.   The  evidence  about
       whether the second of these possibilities is available to  him  under
       Maltese law is vague.  However, it is accepted on his behalf that the
       first  and  third  possibilities  are  available  to  him.    It   is
       appropriate to emphasise that, in this future scenario, the Applicant
       will have had the benefit of his previous experience and any  lessons
       to be learned thereby.   Furthermore,  he  has  been  in  receipt  of
       relevant legal advice during his sojourn in the United Kingdom.   The
       services provided by his lawyers here have  included  direct  contact
       with the JRSM.  As a result, the Applicant's particular case now  has
       a certain profile. It is to be  expected  that  his  solicitors  will
       alert the JRSM to the Applicant's return to Malta.   We  consider  it
       highly likely that in this scenario and assuming that  the  Applicant
       is detained afresh to be prosecuted and/or following  conviction,  he
       will have access to the  JRSM  and  will  receive  legal  advice  and
       support in pursuing one or more  of  the  options  identified  above.
       Furthermore, it is  probable  that  the  Applicant  will  be  further
       assisted in the presentation of his claim by the availability of  the
       written statement and written representations prepared by his English
       solicitors.


   54. Based on the analysis above, we  consider  that  in  the  predictable
       future scenario in which the Applicant will  find  himself  following
       return to Malta, he will not be denied the various due process rights
       canvassed on  his  behalf.    The  final  element  of  this  discrete
       challenge involves a contention that the Applicant also derives  from
       Article 18 of the Charter a right of access to an  independent  Court
       or Tribunal in any challenge to an adverse  first  instance  decision
       and that the RAB is not such a judicial body.


   55. The mechanism  for  submitting  a  further  application  to  the  OCR
       (Refugee Commissioner) is, according to the  evidence,  enshrined  in
       Maltese law, in Articles 4 and 7A of the  Refugees  Act.   An  appeal
       lies to the RAB (Refugee Appeals Board) against any adverse  decision
       of the OCR.  At this stage state funded legal aid becomes  available,
       as documented in the AIDA May 2014 Report.  The suggestion  that  the
       appellate body, the RAB, may not provide an effective remedy  due  to
       lack of independence emanates  from  one  source  only,  namely  ECRI
       (whose  report  is  digested  in  [23]  above).   We   consider   the
       limitations of this  evidence  self-evident.   It  is  based  upon  a
       briefly expressed opinion of this organisation.  There is no evidence
       of the relevant legislation and/or arrangements and policies relating
       to the creation of the RAB, the appointment of its  members  and  its
       relationship with the executive.   Furthermore,  ECRI  expresses  its
       opinion in diffident terms: it is "not convinced"  that  this  is  an
       independent and impartial judicial  body  satisfying  the  Procedures
       Directive .


   56. Having highlighted the limitations of this single piece of  evidence,
       we take into account that the opinion expressed by ECRI in its report
       is not echoed in the reports  of  any  of  the  other  reputable  and
       knowledgeable   organisations   who    have    prepared    comparable
       publications, in particular IRJ, AI, UNHCR and JRSM. Furthermore, the
       ECRI opinion fails to acknowledge the information  contained  in  the
       most recent evidence,  namely  the  AIDA  2014  report,  that  it  is
       possible to challenge decisions of the RAB by  judicial  review  and,
       further, that several cases of this kind have been brought.   We  are
       alive to the (familiar) description of judicial review  as  a  remedy
       which does not have the characteristics  of  a  full  appeal  on  the
       merits.  We also accept that the RAB may not necessarily  convene  an
       oral hearing in every case.  We take into account also  the  evidence
       of increasing success rates in appeals to the RAB.  Having considered
       all the evidence - and the absence thereof - bearing on this discrete
       issue, we conclude that the Applicant has  failed  to  discharge  the
       burden of proving that the RAB, by  reason  of  its  composition,  is
       incapable of providing an effective remedy.


  Risk of Refoulement: Conclusions


    57. The third, and final, limb of the Applicant's case is that to return
        him to Malta under the Dublin Regulation would  be  unlawful  as  it
        would expose him to a  real  risk  of  refoulement  by  the  Maltese
        authorities.  As noted above, this discrete challenge was  canvassed
        under the aegis of Article 18 of the Charter.   We  record  that  an
        incompatibility challenge was initially floated but later  withdrawn
        by Mr Gilbert. In determining this issue, we take  as  our  starting
        point Maltese legislation.   The  principle  of  non-refoulement  is
        enshrined in legislation, Article 14 of the Refugees Act.   This  is
        recorded in the UNHCR 2013 Report, where the following is noted:


             "The practical effect  of  this  provision  is  the  de  facto
             suspension   of   removal   proceedings.    The    immigration
             authorities halt all removal proceedings  once  an  individual
             expresses his/her wish to apply for asylum in Malta by filling
             in the Preliminary Questionnaire  and  submitting  it  to  the
             Office of the Refugee Commissioner."


        Furthermore,  Malta  has,   of   course,   ratified   the   relevant
        international  instruments  which   incorporate   this   protection,
        including in particular Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention  and
        Article 19 of the Charter, which prohibits collective expulsions and
        further provides:


             "No one may be removed, expelled  or  extradited  to  a  State
             where there is a serious risk that he or she would be  subject
             to the death penalty, torture or other  inhuman  or  degrading
             treatment or punishment."


    58. The disparate evidential foundation on  which  this  aspect  of  the
        Applicant's case rests includes  an  account  contained  in  the  AI
        Report of 2010 documenting an asserted failure by the Maltese  Armed
        Forces to  ensure  that  all  members  of  a  group  of  55  Somalis
        travelling in a dinghy from Libya were able to reach the  island  of
        Malta, in circumstances where some 27 were allegedly apprehended  by
        a Libyan vessel and brought back to Libya.  We note that  the  facts
        of this incident are controversial.   Another incident is documented
        in the ICJ Report, describing the return of four migrants to  Libya.
        While the information bearing  on  this  incident  is  minimal,  ICJ
        suggests some unspecified "involvement" of the Maltese  authorities.
        The same report also documents an incident in  July  2013  involving
        the promulgation of an interim measure  by  the  European  Court  of
        Human Rights which, ICJ contends, prevented the possible removal  of
        a group of 102 people from Malta to Libya.  Again,  the  information
        relating to the intentions and conduct of the Maltese  authority  is
        rather threadbare and,  further,  there  are  contradictory  reports
        about the access which UNHCR had to members of the group.   What  is
        clear is that the  Maltese  authorities  gave  full  effect  to  the
        Strasbourg Court's interim ruling and, further, admitted all of  the
        immigrants to its asylum procedure.


    59. We have also considered the evidence relating to another substantial
        group of immigrants in August 2013.  It is  evident  that  the  main
        feature of this particular event was an impasse between the  Maltese
        and Italian Governments, which was quite speedily resolved. Finally,
        we have considered the two decisions of the  Maltese  Constitutional
        Court relating to the forcible repatriation of two Somali  nationals
        to Libya and the case of two Turkish  nationals  of  Kurdish  origin
        (both documented in the JRSM 2013 report).  The context  is  further
        illuminated by the evidence that by 2013 the  numbers  of  irregular
        immigrants arriving in Malta from Libya had increased to some  2,000
        per annum.  In the same year,  the  Maltese  authorities  made  over
        2,000 asylum and subsidiary protection decisions.  One report  noted
        that arrivals equated to approximately 45%  of  the  annual  Maltese
        birth rate.  The island has a population of 428,000 approximately.


    60. We have subjected all of this discrete  collection  of  evidence  to
        critical scrutiny and  have  taken  into  account  its  quality  and
        vintage. Having done so, and taking  the  Applicant's  case  at  its
        reasonable zenith, we consider that he has not established  that  he
        will be at real risk of  refoulement  by  the  Maltese  authorities.
        There is no evidence that Malta has engaged in this  conduct  vis-�-
        vis  any  other  person  returned  under  the   Dublin   Regulation.
        Furthermore, there is no special feature pertaining to the Applicant
        which would trigger this risk.  While  the  demands  and  challenges
        confronted by the Maltese Government are undoubtedly acute, the eyes
        of the international  community  are  firmly  fixed  on  this  small
        Mediterranean island and we consider it  highly  unlikely  that  the
        Maltese authorities would engage in egregious conduct of this  kind.
        We note further that the concern upon  which  this  element  of  the
        Applicant's case is based has not been voiced by UNHCR, AI or  JRSM.
        Furthermore, we agree with Mr Malik that, in this context,  we  must
        be alert to the statement of the Supreme Court in EM (Eritrea)  that
        it is "of obvious significance" that UNHCR has not  recommended  the
        suspension of returns under the Dublin Regulation to Italy: see  per
        Lord  Kerr  at  [74].  We  conclude  that  the   strong   evidential
        presumption that, vis-�-vis the Applicant, Malta  will  comply  with
        its relevant international  obligations  in  this  respect  and  all
        others raised is not displaced by the evidence upon which he relies.




    61. We reiterate our assessment above of the most likely future scenario
        following  the  Applicant's  return  to  Malta.   This  will  entail
        prosecution for  an  immigration  offence,  likely  imprisonment  in
        consequence, the re-opening of his earlier asylum application or the
        presentation of  a  fresh  application  and  the  consideration  and
        determination thereof by the Maltese authorities in accordance  with
        the conditions which we  have  predicted.   There  is  no  realistic
        possibility that the real  risk  of  refoulement  canvassed  by  the
        Applicant will eventuate.

  Article 5 ECHR

    62. As noted above, while the Applicant's case was previously  based  in
        part upon Article 5 ECHR,  this  ground  was  ultimately  abandoned.
        Conscious, however, that there are other live cases  in  which  this
        issue arises, we consider  it  appropriate  to  add  the  following,
        albeit obiter.


    63. The removal of a person to another state viz a  so-called  "foreign"
        case is unlawful if it is  established  that  this  will  result  in
        detention contravening Article 5 ECHR.  The test is whether "a  real
        risk of a flagrant breach" of Article 5 has been established by  the
        evidence;  see Othman v United Kingdom (Application No  8139/09)  at
        [233], decided in 2012.  The threshold is clearly an elevated one:

             "A flagrant breach of Article  5  would  occur  only  if,  for
             example, the receiving state arbitrarily detained an applicant
             for many years without any intention of bringing him or her to
             trial.  A flagrant breach of Article 5 might also occur if  an
             applicant  would  be  at  risk  of  being  imprisoned  for   a
             substantial period in the receiving state,  having  previously
             been convicted after a flagrantly unfair trial."

        Where returns under the Dublin Regulation  are  concerned,  national
        courts must give effect to the principle of mutual  confidence,  the
        related strong evidential presumption of  compliance  by  EU  Member
        States with international obligations and the systemic  deficiencies
        test, which requires "substantial grounds" to be established.   This
        is the effect of the decisions of  the  CJEU  in  NS  and  Abdullahi
        (supra).

    64. One of the stand out features of this Applicant's case  is  that  he
        has already had an application for asylum processed  and  determined
        in Malta and he  was  in  so-called  "administrative"  detention  in
        connection therewith.  We recognise that there may be other cases in
        which persons to be returned to Malta under  the  Dublin  Regulation
        have  not  yet  had  their  asylum  applications  determined.    The
        substantial body of evidence which we have considered suggests that,
        as a matter of strong probability, such  persons,  unless  they  are
        children or considered vulnerable, will be similarly  detained.   In
        such cases, Judges will doubtless take into account, and scrutinise,
        the trenchant claims of the Maltese Government that  such  detention
        is justified. It will also be necessary to recognise the high hurdle
        established by the "real risk of a  flagrant  breach"  test.  Judges
        will also be alert to the notable statement of Mitting J in MB  (And
        Others) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 123 (Admin), at [33], that a real risk of
        administrative detention for a period of some months -


             "..... would fall far short of the circumstances considered by
             the Strasbourg Court in Othman to amount to a flagrant  denial
             of Article 5 rights."


        In the particular circumstances of this Applicant, the  most  likely
        future scenario which we have predicted will entail detention before
        trial and imprisonment post-conviction, which  would  of  course  be
        lawful under Article 5.1(a) or (c) ECHR.  We assume that this is why
        the Article 5 challenge was not ultimately pursued in this case.


  VI  CONCLUSIONS AND ORDER


    65. We conclude as follows:


         (i)      The Applicant has failed  to  displace  the  principle  of
              mutual  confidence  and  to  rebut  the   strong   evidential
              presumption that Malta will, in the event of his return there
              under  the  Dublin  Regulation,  comply  with  its   relevant
              international obligations, in particular those under  Article
              3 ECHR, Article 18 of the  Charter  and  Article  33  of  the
              Refugee Convention.  Furthermore, recalling that  this  is  a
              challenge to a clearly unfounded certification  decision,  we
              are satisfied that there is no legitimate view of the  facts,
              both undisputed and as we have found them, whereby an  appeal
              to the FtT would succeed.


         (ii)     Further or alternatively, giving effect  to  the  somewhat
              different  test  promulgated  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  EM
              (Eritrea), the Applicant has failed to  satisfy  the  Soering
              test, that is to say he has not demonstrated a real risk that
              he will suffer treatment outlawed by Article 3 ECHR.

    66. We order as follows:

        a) Permission to apply for judicial review is granted.


        b) The application is dismissed.


        c) Subject to further representations we give effect to the general
           rule that costs follow the event by ordering that the  Applicant
           pay the  Respondent's  costs,  to  be  assessed  in  default  of
           agreement and taking into account  the  nature  of  the  hearing
           which has been conducted.

Chamber

      Footnote

      An application for permission to appeal to the  Court  of  Appeal  was
      refused,  on  the  ground  that  that  this  decision   involves   the
      application of established  legal  rules  and  principles  to  a  fact
      sensitive matrix.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was given (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3(2)).
