Representation
For the appellant : Ms N. Loughran, of counsel, instructed  by  Gray  &  Co.
Solicitors
For the respondent : Mr A. Scarcliffe, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS
1.    This is an appeal by Meray Kus,  a  citizen  of  Turkey,  against  the
      determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  Professor  R.M.M.  Wallace,   who
      dismissed her appeal against the  respondent's  decision  made  on  13
      October 1999 refusing her leave to remain  under  paragraph  286  with
      reference to paragraph 284(2) and 322(1) of HC 395.

2.    The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 11 May  1997  having  been
      given leave to enter as an au pair until 11 May 1999.  On 7  May  1999
      she applied for indefinite  leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of  her
      marriage to a person settled in the United Kingdom and  for  leave  to
      continue employment under the EU/Turkish Association  Agreement.   Her
      application was refused on both grounds. Her husband was not a  person
      present and settled in the United Kingdom. Her application  under  the
      Association Agreement was refused on  the  basis  that  she  had  been
      admitted as an au pair and was expected to leave the United Kingdom at
      the end of her placement and in the light of this  she  could  not  be
      said to have been integrated into the workforce.

3.    At the appeal before the Adjudicator it was  agreed  that  the  appeal
      could not succeed on the basis of the appellant's marriage. Her spouse
      whom she married on 30  April  1999  is  a  Turkish  seaman  currently
      seeking asylum in the United Kingdom. He was not present  and  settled
      within the meaning of paragraph 284(ii) of HC  395.   The  Adjudicator
      went on to consider the issue of whether the respondent had been wrong
      in refusing the  application  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  to
      continue employment within the terms  of  the  EU/Turkish  Association
      Agreement.

4.    The  Adjudicator  summarised  the  relevant  facts  as  follows.   The
      appellant arrived in the United Kingdom on 11 May 1997 and was granted
      leave to enter for two years as an au pair.  She  had  worked  with  a
      family in Glasgow, working two days a week  for  a  total  of  fifteen
      hours. She received ï¿½30 per week. This was confirmed by a letter  from
      her employer dated 5 May 1999. In that letter it was stated  that  the
      appellant worked 'as a part time au pair' for the family.  The  letter
      also says that the appellant had worked for two years on a  full  time
      basis but after her recent marriage she  now  worked  part  time.  She
      continued to work for the family from June 1999 until  November  2001.
      In her oral evidence she explained that  'full  time'  in  the  letter
      amounted to about 22-25 hours.

5.    The Adjudicator has set out  her  findings  in  paragraph  10  of  her
      determination. There was no dispute that  the  appellant  entered  the
      United Kingdom as an au pair having been granted entry clearance under
      the terms of paragraph 88 of HC 395. The endorsement on  her  passport
      gave her leave to enter on condition that she did not enter employment
      paid or unpaid other than as an au  pair.  It  was  argued  that  this
      recognised the fact that the appellant was a member of the  workforce.
      The Adjudicator was not satisfied that this was the case.   She  found
      that the appellant was not exercising a community right to work as her
      leave to enter was  subject  to  the  purposes  and  rules  for  entry
      clearance as an au pair.

6.    The Adjudicator went on to consider whether the appellant could  claim
      a right to remain under the Association  Agreement  without  obtaining
      prior entry clearance. Having found that the appellant was not in  the
      United Kingdom as a worker  and was not exercising  a  right  of  free
      movement for workers, she was satisfied that  the  appellant  was  not
      entitled to make an in-country application  as  the  system  of  prior
      entry clearance operated by the United Kingdom was permissible  within
      the terms of the Association Agreement.

7.    The first  question  which  arises  in  this  appeal  is  whether  the
      appellant is a 'worker' within the provisions of Article 6(1)  of  the
      Association agreement.  Article 6(1) only benefits those  workers  who
      fulfil the following three conditions:

      (a) He is a worker and legally employed,
      (b) He is duly registered as belonging to the labour force
      (c) He has been  legally employed for one of the three  possible  time
      periods.

      These concepts are interconnected as legal  employment  presupposes  a
      stable and secure situation as a member of the labour force.

8.    Miss Loughran referred the Tribunal to  Birden  (C-1/97,  26  November
      1998) which is authority for  the  proposition  that  the  concept  of
      worker for the purposes of Article 6(1) effectively  incorporates  the
      concept of worker under Community Law.  The basic community definition
      of a worker is that  an  individual  for  a  certain  period  of  time
      performs services for and under the direction of another in return for
      which he  receives  remuneration.  This  term  includes  trainees  and
      apprentices,  part  time  workers  and  those  engaged  in  employment
      schemes. The underlying requirement is that the person is engaged in a
      'genuine and effective economic activity' and that 'he is entitled  to
      the same conditions of work and pay as those which may be  claimed  by
      workers who pursue  identical  or  similar  activities,  so  that  his
      situation is not objectively different from that  of  those  of  other
      workers.'

9.    The argument on behalf of the  appellant  is  that  she  is  a  worker
      because she has been given leave to enter to work as an au  pair.  The
      grant of entry clearance may limit the category of work to being an au
      pair but the fact that leave is so limited does not mean that  she  is
      not a worker.

10.   Mr Scarcliffe argues that the  appellant  is  not  a  worker  for  the
      simple reason that she is pursuing an activity as an  au  pair  within
      the specific provisions of the Immigration Rules.  It is  provided  by
      paragraph 88 that for the purposes of these rules an au pair placement
      is an arrangement whereby a young person:

       (a)  comes to the United Kingdom for purpose of learning the  English
           language;

      (b)   lives for a time as a member of an English speaking family  with
           appropriate opportunities for study;  and

      (c)   helps in the home for a maximum of five hours a  day  in  return
           for a reasonable allowance and with two free days per week.

      It is submitted that this is not work or at least not the exercise  of
      the community right of being a worker in the sense of  exercising  the
      right of free movement of workers.

11.   In the judgment of  the  Tribunal,  Mr  Scarcliffe  is  right  in  his
      argument. The appellant does not meet the basic  community  definition
      of a 'worker'. She has been granted leave to enter as an au pair.  The
      purpose of this arrangement is to learn  English  and  to  live  as  a
      member of an English speaking family. The restriction in the  passport
      on other types of work  cannot  be  interpreted  as  an  admission  or
      concession that the appellant is in fact a worker. The Adjudicator was
      correct to find that the appellant's activities in the United  Kingdom
      were within the specific rules prescribed for an au pair placement and
      did not amount to being a worker.

12.   In her skeleton argument and written submissions Miss Loughran  relies
      on a number of authorities. The first is Savas.   This  confirms  that
      the only Turkish workers who may benefit from the rules are those  who
      satisfy the requirements laid down by decision 1/80 (i.e.  those  duly
      registered as belonging to the labour force of the host  member  state
      or being lawfully employed for a certain period).  This case does  not
      take the matter any further as to whether or  not  this  appellant  in
      fact satisfies the requirements.  For the reasons we have given we are
      not satisfied that she does.  As an au pair  she  cannot  properly  be
      regarded as belonging to the labour force. The submissions also  refer
      to Nazli which is dealt with by the Adjudicator in paragraph 10 of her
      determination.  The point in Nazli is that  the  individual  concerned
      was recognised as a member of the labour force and was duly registered
      and had a work permit of unlimited duration. Janey is  of  limited  if
      any relevance to the issues in the present appeal as it was limited to
      the issue of whether economic activity was wide enough to  encapsulate
      'window  prostitution'.    However,  the  fact  that  one   particular
      activity may be regarded as an economic activity does  not  cast  much
      light on whether the appellant's admission to the United Kingdom as an
      au pair amounted to being admitted as a worker.

13.   It is argued that as an au  pair  provides  services,  her  activities
      should be regarded as falling within the term  'economic  activities'.
      But that does not deal with the point that under the Immigration Rules
      an au pair placement is an arrangement primarily for  the  purpose  of
      learning English and living with an English speaking family.

14.   The second issue is whether the United Kingdom is able to  exercise  a
      system of prior control  to  ensure  that  a  potential  applicant  is
      entitled to  rely  on  the  provisions  of  the  relevant  Association
      Agreement.  The  Tribunal  are  satisfied  that  the  United   Kingdom
      government is permitted to take this course.  The  Tribunal  need  not
      deal with this issue at length but adopt the reasoning of the Tribunal
      in Mocko [2002] UKIAT 00563 which takes due account of the decision in
      the European Court in Glosczuk (C-63/99) the principle  being  further
      confirmed by the judgment of the Court in Kondova (C-235/99) relied on
      by Mr Scarcliffe.

15.   Accordingly, for the reasons the Tribunal have attempted to  set  out,
      in our judgment the findings and conclusions of  the  Adjudicator  are
      correct. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed.
