Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  Mr  Bautista's  appeal
against the decision to deport him from the United Kingdom.

For the purposes of this decision, we shall refer to the Secretary of  State
as the  respondent  and  Mr  Bautisa  as  the  appellant,  reflecting  their
positions as they were in the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

The appellant is a citizen of the Philippines, born on 13 February 1953.  He
entered the United Kingdom lawfully on 23 May 1977 on  a  working  visa  and
was subsequently granted indefinite leave to remain.  He  was  convicted  of
theft on 2 June 1981, for which he was fined ï¿½50. According  to  the  stamps
in his passport he had travelled back and forth  to  the  Philippines  since
his arrival.

On 3 July 2010 the appellant was convicted at Highbury  Corner  Magistrates'
Court of possession with intent  to  supply  methylamphetamine,  a  class  A
controlled drug,  and  was  sentenced  at  Blackfriars  Crown  Court  on  10
September 2010 to four years imprisonment. He  was  convicted  at  the  same
time and in the  same  court  of  possession  of  a  prohibited  weapon  and
received a sentence of one year imprisonment. He therefore received  a  five
year sentence in total and accordingly fell for automatic deportation  under
section  32(5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act  2007.  A  deportation  order  was
accordingly made against him and on 14 February 2013  a  decision  was  made
that section 32(5) applied.

The respondent, in making that decision, noted  the  sentencing  remarks  of
the Crown Court Judge which showed the serious  nature  of  the  appellant's
offence. Consideration was given to the immigration rules  with  respect  to
Article 8 of the ECHR. The appellant fell within  paragraph  398(a)  of  the
rules, applicable to offences leading to a sentence of  imprisonment  of  at
least four years, whereby it would  only  be  in  exceptional  circumstances
that his right to family and/or  private  life  would  outweigh  the  public
interest in his deportation. The respondent noted  that  the  appellant  was
married with four children and that he  had  been  resident  in  the  United
Kingdom for 35 years and nine months including the time sent in custody.  He
had married his wife, a Philippine national, on 24 April 2004  and  she  had
subsequently naturalised as a British citizen in 2007.  He  had  four  adult
children who  were  British  citizens.  The  respondent  accepted  that  the
appellant had established a family and private life in the  United  Kingdom.
His details of employment were not known, but he had claimed to have  worked
as  a  waiter  and  chauffeur.  It  was  not  considered  that  there   were
insurmountable obstacles to the appellant's wife and children following  him
to the Philippines, but in any event it was noted that his children were  no
longer  dependent  upon  him.  The  respondent  noted  that  the   appellant
continued to have ties to the Philippines, having  travelled  there  several
times since his arrival in the  United  Kingdom.  Although  he  had  several
medical conditions, it was considered that he  could  receive  treatment  in
the Philippines. The respondent accordingly concluded that  the  appellant's
deportation would not breach Article 8.

Appeal before the First-tier Tribunal

The appellant's appeal against that decision was  heard  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal on 23 April 2013, before a panel consisting of First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Martins and Mr J O de Barros. The Tribunal heard from  the  appellant.
It was noted from his statement that he had been  granted  indefinite  leave
to remain after four years of entry to the United Kingdom  and  had  had  36
years of lawful residence here. He had met his wife in 1978  and  had  lived
with her for a long time, but they were not married  until  24  April  2004.
Their daughter was 23 years of age and was studying and working in  the  US.
He had grown-up children from a  previous  relationship  and  grandchildren.
The appellant claimed to have stayed away from anyone  associated  with  his
past and from the woman with whom he had been having an affair and in  whose
house he  had  been  arrested.  He  claimed  to  have  no-one  left  in  the
Philippines and to have all  his  family  in  the  United  Kingdom.  On  the
occasions that he had visited the  Philippines,  it  had  been  to  see  his
mother-in-law who was currently 82 years old.

In his evidence before the Tribunal the appellant explained that he had  not
applied to be naturalised as a British citizen as he had not really  thought
about it. His wife had naturalised in order to be able to travel  to  Europe
without a visa. He had visited the Philippines in 2006, 2007, 2008 and  2010
to visit his mother-in-law and also for a holiday. He had only  his  mother-
in-law and two nieces there who lived with  her.  He  had  three  daughters,
aged 23, 34 and 38 and a son aged 41, all of whom were  working.  His  three
older children were from a previous partner. He had not  worked  since  2007
when he suffered a heart attack although he did  some  part-time  work  with
his wife in terms of cleaning and maintenance  at  her  place  of  work.  He
started dealing in drugs in 2006 and his family only became  aware  of  that
when he was arrested in July 2010. His source of income was not from  drugs,
but he sold them only to support his own addiction. With regard to the  stun
gun with which he was found, he claimed that that had been for his  daughter
for her protection, although the Tribunal noted that the Crown  Court  Judge
had not believed that. He had been in a relationship with another woman  for
three years but his wife had not known about it until his arrest and  he  no
longer saw his girlfriend.

The Tribunal heard from the appellant's wife and his two daughters and  then
heard submissions from both  representatives.  They  found  the  appellant's
wife and  daughters  to  be  credible  witnesses  and  found  the  appellant
credible for the most part. With regard to  discrepancies  in  the  evidence
between that recorded in the OASys and that of the witnesses as to where  he
had been living, they accepted that the  information  at  the  time  of  his
arrest and interview for the OASys report had been given in  an  attempt  to
protect his family and  that  he  had  always  lived  with  his  wife.  They
accepted  that  his  family  knew  nothing  of  his  drugs  dealing  or  his
girlfriend  until  his  arrest.  They  did  not   accept   the   appellant's
explanation for possessing a stun gun. They accepted that  he  was  unlikely
to re-offend. They accepted that he did not have social or cultural ties  in
the Philippines. They agreed with the submissions made on  his  behalf  that
the circumstances of his case were exceptional and  accordingly  found  that
he succeeded under the immigration rules. They found in any event  that  his
deportation would breach his Article 8 rights in the wider context and  they
accordingly allowed his appeal.

The respondent sought permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the
following grounds: that the Tribunal had  not  given  adequate  reasons  for
finding the appellant's circumstances exceptional  and  appeared  simply  to
have adopted the submissions made on  behalf  of  the  appellant;  that  the
Tribunal had erred by finding that the appellant had  severed  all  ties  to
the Philippines; that the Tribunal had failed to give adequate  reasons  for
setting aside the evidence  contained  in  the  OASys  indicating  that  the
appellant and his wife were not living together and that their  findings  in
that respect were perverse; that the Tribunal had erred by  applying  a  two
stage approach to Article 8; and that  in  assessing  the  appellant's  case
under Article 8 the Tribunal had failed to give  adequate  consideration  to
the public interest.

Permission to appeal was granted on 25 June 2013 on all grounds.

Appeal before the Upper Tribunal

 The appeal came before us on 31 July 2013.  We  heard  submissions  on  the
error of law.

 Mr Avery, in his submissions, expanded  upon  the  grounds  of  appeal.  He
submitted that the Tribunal's findings  on  exceptional  circumstances  were
limited and merely relied on the appellant's  representative's  submissions.
They had not properly considered what the test was and had  not  dealt  with
the difference between "exceptional" and  "unjustifiably  harsh".  They  had
not undertaken a rounded consideration  of  the  appellant's  circumstances,
including the nature of his offence. Their assessment was therefore  flawed.
Likewise, their assessment of  the  appellant's  links  to  his  country  of
origin were flawed and their findings were not consistent with the  guidance
in Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2013] UKUT 00060.  With  regard
to the grounds relating to Article 8, Mr Avery submitted that  the  Tribunal
had failed to make any real reference to the public interest and that  their
approach was inconsistent with the principles in SS (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013]
EWCA Civ 550.

Mr O'Ceallaigh submitted that the respondent's grounds were no more  than  a
disagreement. The Tribunal referred to the  "unjustifiably  harsh"  test  in
their determination. If the respondent was now  suggesting  that  that  went
beyond "exceptional" then it should have been included  in  the  immigration
rules. Since it was not within the rules, it was not binding.  The  Tribunal
did not find that the appellant had severed all  ties  to  the  Philippines,
but that he had very little ties to the country,  which  was  a  sustainable
finding. The principles in Ogundimu applied to those convicted  of  offences
for which they had been sentenced to less than four years in prison and  not
to those demonstrating exceptional  circumstances.  The  Tribunal  did  have
regard to the seriousness of the appellant's offence.  Their  findings  were
not perverse and they were entitled to  make  the  findings  they  did  with
regard to the appellant's living circumstances and ties to the  Philippines.
The  appellant's  circumstances  were  exceptional.  With  regard  to  their
findings on Article 8 the Tribunal were clearly aware of the need to  accord
weight to the Secretary of State's view. In terms of the principles  in  SS,
this was a strong Article 8 claim.

In response, Mr Avery reiterated the points made previously.

Consideration and findings.

Before setting out our findings we consider it of  some  relevance  to  make
the following observation. The deportation decision refers to the  appellant
having entered the United Kingdom lawfully but appears to make no  reference
to  his  immigration  status  thereafter  and  prior  to   the   deportation
proceedings. The evidence before  the  Tribunal  was  that  he  was  granted
indefinite leave to remain four years after entry to the United Kingdom  and
the Tribunal accordingly made their findings on the basis that he  had  been
lawfully in the United Kingdom for the entire period of his residence.  That
has not been challenged and we accordingly proceed on the same basis.

We  have  carefully  considered  the  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the
Secretary of State but we find ourselves in agreement with Mr  O'Ceallaigh's
view that the respondent's grounds of  appeal  amount  to  no  more  than  a
disagreement with the Tribunal's findings.

We do not agree with the assertion  made  in  the  first  ground,  that  the
Tribunal  simply  endorsed  and  adopted  the  appellant's  representative's
submissions in regard to the exceptional circumstances without making  their
own findings. It is the case that the Tribunal agreed with  the  submissions
made on behalf of the appellant and stated as much at the end  of  paragraph
88, but that in itself is not indicative of an  absence  of  an  independent
judicial assessment. The Tribunal recorded in some detail  at  paragraph  74
the submissions for  the  appellant  on  exceptionality,  referring  to  the
"unjustifiably harsh" definition provided  in  the  Immigration  Directorate
Instructions, as set out at paragraph 71. They  clearly  had  that  in  mind
when  considering  exceptionality.  Furthermore,  we  find   force   in   Mr
O'Ceallaigh's submission  that  had  the  term  "unjustifiably  harsh"  been
intended to go beyond "exceptional", the term would,  no  doubt,  have  been
separately defined in the immigration rules, which it is not.

Aside from asserting their agreement with the appellant's submissions as  to
exceptionality,  the  Tribunal  undertook  their  own  assessment   of   the
appellant's circumstances, at paragraphs 86 and 87 of  their  determination.
Contrary to Mr Avery's submission, it seems to us that that  was  a  rounded
assessment that took account of all factors, including  the  seriousness  of
the appellant's offence, to which they referred at paragraph 86.  They  also
took account of the credibility issues that had arisen in the  evidence,  in
particular the differing account of the appellant's place of  residence  set
out in the OASys report, but they accepted  the  explanation  given  by  the
appellant. The grounds assert that the  Tribunal  failed  to  give  adequate
reasons for so doing and for setting aside the  evidence  contained  in  the
OASys report. However they  plainly  did  give  reasons,  at  paragraph  84,
namely that the appellant was attempting to protect his  family.  There  was
nothing perverse in such reasoning, as suggested in the  grounds,  and  that
was a finding that was open to the Tribunal, having heard  extensively  from
various family members and found them to  be  entirely  credible  witnesses.
Likewise, the Tribunal was entitled to accept, as they did at paragraph  84,
that the appellant's family knew nothing of  his  drug  dealing  or  of  his
girlfriend. The grounds assert that that was a  perverse  finding,  but  the
threshold of establishing perversity is a high one and we  do  not  consider
that the  grounds  come  anywhere  near  to  crossing  that  threshold.  The
Tribunal had the benefit of hearing from the witnesses and were entitled  to
make the findings that they did on their evidence and, as such, we find  the
grounds to be no more than disagreement.

It is also asserted in the  grounds  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in  law  by
finding that the appellant  had  severed  all  ties  with  the  Philippines.
However, as Mr O'Ceallaigh submitted, that  was  not  what  they  found.  At
paragraph 87 they  considered  the  evidence  of  the  various  witness  and
reached a conclusion  that  the  appellant  had  very  little  ties  to  the
Philippines and that he could not be said to have social  or  cultural  ties
of any import. That was a conclusion they were entitled to reach. We do  not
consider that  such  findings  were  inconsistent  with  the  principles  in
Ogundimu, in particular since the considerations in that case were  relevant
to a different part of the rules, and neither do  we  find  that  they  were
perverse.

Having taken all relevant factors into account, including  the  evidence  of
the appellant and the witnesses, the family  circumstances  and  the  effect
upon them of the appellant's deportation, the appellant's  age  and  medical
history, his ties to his country of origin, the circumstances and nature  of
the appellant's offence, his immigration and criminal history and  the  risk
of re-offending as outlined in the OASys report, the Tribunal were  entitled
to reach the conclusion that they did in regard  to  exceptionality.  Whilst
another Tribunal may have reached  a  different  decision,  and  whilst  the
respondent plainly disagrees with the findings of this Tribunal,  it  cannot
be said that their findings were perverse or that they  did  not  take  into
account all relevant factors or give clear and cogent reasons  for  reaching
the conclusions that they did. Accordingly we find no error of law in  their
decision with respect to the immigration rules.

Mr Avery did not actively pursue the second ground  of  appeal  relating  to
the two stage approach to Article 8 and clearly the Tribunal  were  entitled
to follow the approach in MF (Nigeria) [2012] UKUT 00393.

In the light of our findings on the Tribunal's decision with respect to  the
immigration rules,  and  considering  that  the  immigration  rules  are  an
expression of the Secretary of State's view  of  the  public  interest,  the
respondent's challenge to their approach to proportionality in Article 8  in
its wider context plainly falls away.

Accordingly we find that the Tribunal did not make  any  errors  of  law  in
their decision. They were entitled to reach the decision that they  did  and
the grounds of appeal amount to  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  that
decision.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  involve  an
error on a point of law. We do not set aside the decision. The Secretary  of
State's appeal is dismissed and the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  to
allow the appellant's appeal stands.
