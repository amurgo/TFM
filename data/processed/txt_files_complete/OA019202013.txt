    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Miss R Akhter of
           counsel instructed by FLK Solicitors
          For the Respondent: Mr G Saunders a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on 5  April  1989.
      She has been given permission to appeal the  determination  of  First-
      Tier Tribunal Judge Buckwell ("the FTTJ")  who  dismissed  her  appeal
      against the respondent's decision of 23 November  2012  to  refuse  to
      grant her entry clearance for settlement in the UK as  the  spouse  of
      her husband and sponsor Mohad Aslam under the provisions of  paragraph
      281 of the Immigration Rules.


   2. The  respondent  refused  the  application  because  the  sponsor  was
      previously married and had not shown that he had  obtained  a  divorce
      that was recognised under UK law by the time he married the  appellant
      on 26 March 2011. The decree absolute of divorce  which  he  submitted
      was dated 20 December 2011. Whilst he could marry more than  one  wife
      under the laws of Pakistan he could not do so under the law of the  UK
      where he was domiciled. No evidence had been supplied to show that  he
      was domiciled anywhere else. The application  was  refused  under  the
      provisions of paragraph 281(i)(a)(i).


   3. The appellant appealed and the FTTJ heard  her  appeal  on  3  January
      2014. Both parties were represented and the sponsor gave evidence. The
      appellant's representative accepted that she could not  succeed  under
      the provisions of paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules. However,  it
      was argued that the respondent should have considered the  application
      under the separate provisions for fianc�es in  paragraph  290  of  the
      Immigration Rules. The FTTJ found that there was no prospect that  the
      application could have succeeded under  the  fianc�e  provisions.  The
      appellant was not seeking  leave  to  enter  the  United  Kingdom  for
      marriage because she and the sponsor considered that they were already
      married. In relation to the Article 8  grounds  the  FTTJ  found  that
      there  was  no  expert  evidence  about  marriages  in  Pakistan   not
      recognised in the UK which would enable him to find that the appellant
      and the sponsor were stuck in a situation where the Immigration  Rules
      could never be satisfied. He concluded that to exclude  the  appellant
      would not be a disproportionate interference with her right to respect
      for her Article 8 human rights. The appeal  was  dismissed  under  the
      Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.


   4. The judge did not make an anonymity direction. I have not  been  asked
      to do so and can see no need for such a direction.


   5. The appellant applied for and was granted permission to appeal to  the
      Upper Tribunal. There is a Rule 24 response from the respondent  dated
      21 February 2014.


   6. Miss Akhter relied on CP (Section 86(3)  and  (5);  wrong  immigration
      rule) Dominica [2006] UKAIT 00040. I find that this  does  not  assist
      the appellant. Unlike CP this is  not  a  case  where  the  respondent
      applied the wrong  immigration  rule.  In  that  case  the  result  of
      applying the wrong immigration rule was that the immigration  decision
      was technically  unlawful.  In  this  appeal  it  is  clear  that  the
      appellant was making a marriage application which had  to  be  decided
      under  paragraph  281  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The   respondent
      considered and decided the application under the  correct  immigration
      rule and the decision was lawful. Paragraph 16 of CP does  not  assist
      Miss  Akhter's  submission.  It  states;  "reading  these   provisions
      together, we are left in no doubt that they impose a legal  duty  upon
      decision-makers acting to regulate entry and stay in the UK  to  apply
      the  immigration  rules  and,  specifically,  to  apply  the   correct
      immigration rules applicable to the circumstances put forward  by  the
      individual in his application to (sic) entry or stay in the  UK".  The
      appellant  made  her  application  on  the  form  used  for   marriage
      settlement  applications  and  direct  and  indirect   references   to
      settlement and marriage appear throughout the application form. It  is
      clear beyond doubt that it  was  a  marriage  application  and  not  a
      fianc�e application. I find that neither the respondent nor  the  FTTJ
      were under any duty to consider the application or  the  appeal  under
      the  Immigration  Rules  on  any  basis  other  than  as  a   marriage
      application. The test is not whether the application  would  or  might
      have succeeded had it been considered as a fianc�e  application  under
      paragraph 290, although had it been I would agree with the  FTTJ  that
      the appellant would, at the least, have had difficulty  in  satisfying
      the requirements of paragraph 290. She was not seeking leave to  enter
      the UK for marriage because she and the sponsor considered  that  they
      were already married. Whilst the sponsor told the  FTTJ  that  if  the
      appellant could come to  this  country  he  would  undertake  a  civil
      marriage ceremony with her this information was not available  to  the
      respondent at the date of the decision.


   7. Whilst the Presenting Officer at the hearing before the FTTJ indicated
      that if it was considered appropriate  he  would  not  object  to  the
      matter being remitted to the respondent for further  consideration  it
      was for the FTTJ to decide whether this was appropriate. I  find  that
      he did not err in law in rejecting this course  of  action.  He  could
      only have  done  so  if  he  had  come  to  the  conclusion  that  the
      respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law. This was not
      the case.


   8. In relation to the Article 8 grounds Miss Akhter  submitted  that  the
      FTTJ erred in  law  by  failing  to  weigh  in  the  balance  and  the
      proportionality exercise the fact that the appellant and  the  sponsor
      could not live together as husband and wife in the UK. On the evidence
      before the FTTJ I am not persuaded that this is or was the  case.  The
      appellant claims that now the sponsor has  obtained  his  divorce  and
      because she is already married under the laws of Pakistan  it  is  not
      possible for them to  go  through  another  ceremony  of  marriage  in
      Pakistan which would be recognised in the UK. There is  no  expert  or
      country information to show that this is the case.  Miss  Akhter  also
      argued that, even if the appellant and the sponsor  were  able  to  go
      through another form of marriage which would be recognised in  the  UK
      they would fall foul of the current more stringent financial criteria.
      I can find no indication that this argument or any evidence to support
      it was put to the FTTJ.


   9. I find that there is no error of law and I uphold the determination of
      the FTTJ.
