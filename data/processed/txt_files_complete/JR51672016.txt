             IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW



                                   Before

                         UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE KEKI?

                                                                   Applicant

            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective representatives, Ms K  Tobin  of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Theva
Solicitors on behalf of the Applicant and Mr Z Malik of Counsel,  instructed
by the Government Legal Department,  on  behalf  of  the  Respondent,  at  a
hearing at Field House, London on 13 March 2017.


Decision: the application for judicial review is refused









                                  JUDGMENT


   1. This is an application for judicial review, with permission granted by
      Upper Tribunal Judge Southern on 1 November  2016  following  an  oral
      hearing. The earlier application for permission  was  refused  on  the
      papers by Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane on 11 August 2016 and by way
      of the same decision permission to amend the grounds was also refused.
       On 8 March 2017, the respondent  was  granted  permission  to  adduce
      further documentary evidence by Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson.


   2. The challenge is in respect  of  the  respondent's  decisions,  on  10
      February 2016, to refuse  his  application  for  indefinite  leave  to
      remain under the Points Based System (PBS) and, on 23 March  2016,  to
      maintain that refusal following an administrative review. The judicial
      review claim was filed on 10 May 2016.


   3. The application for oral renewal was received by the  Tribunal  on  24
      August 2016. As Judge Lane's decision was  promulgated  on  11  August
      2016, the nine-day deadline expired on 20 August. This matter was  not
      considered by Upper Tribunal Judge  Southern  at  the  hearing.    The
      representatives explained the delay was  due  to  the  fact  that  the
      Tribunal served the notice on the previous solicitors  despite  having
      been informed on 15  July  2016  that  new  representatives  had  been
      instructed. Whilst no confirmation of the change of representatives is
      apparent from the file or the computer data base and  no  evidence  of
      the  incorrect  delivery  has  been  adduced,  given  the  fact   that
      permission has been granted, that the matter was  not  raised  at  the
      previous hearing and that Mr Malik did not  raise  any  objections,  I
      consider it just to extend time and accordingly do so.

Background


   4. The applicant, an Indian national born on 7 March 1983, arrived  as  a
      student in January 2006 and subsequently varied his  leave  under  the
      International Graduate Scheme, Tier 1 (Post Study  Work)  and  Tier  1
      (General). On 10 February 2016 during the validity of his last  period
      of leave, he applied for indefinite leave to remain.


   5. The respondent refused the  application.  She  considered  there  were
      discrepancies between  the  applicant's  self-employment  earnings  as
      declared to HMRC and those declared to the Home Office. The respondent
      maintained that in his Tier 1 application, made on  9  December  2013,
      the applicant declared self-employment income for the period 1 January
      2013 to 30 November 2013 as �29,946 and employment income of �6554.41.
      A check with HMRC showed the following figures for self-employment for
      the tax year April 2012 to April 2013: gross turnover of �5048 and net
      earnings of �4289. No income was declared for the following  tax  year
      but the respondent took account of an SA302 for that year which showed
      a  self-employment  profit  of  �6978.   She   considered   that   the
      inconsistency between the figures showed that the applicant  had  been
      dishonest either in his dealings with HMRC or with  the  Secretary  of
      State and concluded that it was undesirable to allow him to remain  in
      the UK. Accordingly,  the  application  was  refused  under  paragraph
      322(5).  The respondent also had concerns over whether the applicant's
      present income was genuine and additionally  refused  the  application
      under paragraph 245CD, with reference to 245CD(e).


   6. In his grounds, the  applicant  argues  that  the  respondent  made  a
      material error of law. She is criticized  for  failing  to  apply  the
      correct immigration rule, for failing to consider the application  for
      administrative  review  in  accordance  with  Appendix  AR   (by   not
      considering important documentary evidence) and for abusing her  power
      by  refusing  the  application  under  paragraph  322(5)  and  thereby
      disadvantaging the applicant given  the  terms  of  paragraph  2.4  of
      Appendix AR.  It is also maintained that there was a material error of
      fact made by the respondent when she concluded that the applicant  had
      provided false information.

The Hearing


   7. The hearing proceeded on 13 March 2017. I heard submissions  from  the
      parties on their respective cases.


   8. Ms Tobin relied on her skeleton  argument  and  other  documents.  She
      argued that this was a common-law fairness  challenge.  The  applicant
      had put in his application with the evidence required of him  but,  in
      making her decision, the respondent not only took  into  account  that
      evidence, but also the results of enquiries she made of HMRC.  Details
      of those enquiries had not been disclosed to  the  applicant  although
      they had been referred to in the decision letter. Ms Tobin  relied  on
      the GCID case notes which, she pointed out, referred to figures  in  a
      different sum to those in the decision letter.  She  argued  that  the
      applicant was not, therefore, fully aware of the case against him and,
      at the time of the administrative review, he had not been aware of the
      full extent of the  enquiries.  Furthermore,  the  procedure  did  not
      permit him to produce further evidence to refute the allegations made.
      She submitted that had he had that opportunity,  he  would  have  been
      able to provide an explanation. She submitted that he  had  been  here
      for 10 years with various grants of leave and had  been  employed  and
      self-employed; that meant  that  the  figures  were  complex.  He  had
      applied under  the  premium  one  day  service  because  he  had  been
      confident about the outcome and  he  had  relied  both  on  his  self-
      employment and employment incomes. She argued that the refusal  letter
      looked only at the self-employment figures whereas his  income  should
      have been considered holistically.


   9. Ms Tobin argued that further to the application made in December 2013,
      the applicant had been invited to submit further evidence  in  respect
      of an issue that had arisen and had then been called for an  interview
      at which he addressed the issue; leave had subsequently been  granted.
      The applicant had an expectation that the same process would apply  on
      this occasion. Ms Tobin pointed out  that  the  application  had  been
      refused under paragraph 322(5), a discretionary ground, because it was
      uncertain where the deception lay; whether this was to HMRC or to  the
      Secretary of State. She submitted that this  was  significant  because
      the respondent had to be sure that the applicant  had  been  dishonest
      otherwise there was procedural  unfairness.  She  submitted  that  the
      application had not been  lacking  in  evidence  and  this  basis  for
      refusal could not have been foreseen. The applicant had not been given
      an opportunity to respond to the enquiries made by the respondent  and
      this breached basic  fairness  principles.  She  took  me  to  various
      authorities in support of this submission.


  10. Ms Tobin submitted that the unfairness  principles  were  particularly
      relevant in these circumstances because  of  the  seriousness  of  the
      allegations made and because the refusal was a  discretionary  ground.
      She submitted that although the figures admittedly looked stark, there
      was no such discrepancy when the full picture was taken into  account.
      She submitted that the  decision  letter  only  took  issue  with  the
      figures for self-employment whereas the applicant had since  explained
      that some of the earnings he anticipated paying  tax  on  as  a  self-
      employed individual in 2013 were put forward as employment earnings by
      HLA, the firm he had as a client. She emphasised that the sum total of
      his earnings was the important issue and had the respondent considered
      this, she would have realised that tax  had  been  paid  on  the  full
      amount.


  11. Ms Tobin submitted that the evidence the respondent had  on  file  was
      not reflected in the decision letter but even the  evidence  mentioned
      therein was not consistent with what the applicant had declared to the
      respondent. She submitted that HMRC records directly contradicted  the
      figures in the decision letter. She referred me to  the  schedule  she
      had prepared of an income breakdown and pointed out that  the  figures
      were further complicated by the fact that the declared amounts covered
      two tax  years.  She  admitted  that  the  applicant  had  erroneously
      referred to gross turnover instead  of  profit  on  one  occasion  but
      submitted this had no material bearing on his application because even
      if the lower figure had been declared, he would  still  have  acquired
      sufficient points. She submitted that he had claimed  for  110  points
      (in fact he claimed 120 points) whereas he only needed  75  points  to
      succeed in 2013. It had been unfair of the respondent not to  put  her
      concerns to him. There had been no  need  for  him  to  be  untruthful
      because he exceeded the required points by any calculation. His  total
      earnings for the relevant year  amounted  to  over  �20,000.  Had  the
      respondent taken his full income into account,  she  would  have  seen
      there was no deception and that full tax had been paid.


  12. With respect to the second limb of refusal, Ms Tobin  submitted  there
      had been no finding that the  more  recent  figures  were  dishonestly
      claimed. The respondent should  have  taken  care  in  exercising  her
      discretion  and  the  only  error  made  by  the  applicant  did   not
      demonstrate any deceit. She  invited  me  to  quash  the  respondent's
      decision.


  13. In response, Mr Malik submitted that the claim was hopeless and  could
      not succeed on any calculation. Contrary to what had been argued, this
      was a straightforward case and fell  to  be  refused  under  paragraph
      322(5) and paragraph 19 of Appendix A. Two points  had  been  made  on
      behalf of the applicant. The first was that the  respondent  had  made
      errors of fact and that her conclusions regarding  his  earnings  were
      irrational. The second was that her decision was procedurally unfair.


  14. With respect to the first point, Mr Malik reminded me of  the  correct
      approach in judicial review cases involving deception and referred  me
      to the relevant authorities. He relied on the rules  in  operation  at
      the time and pointed out that the guidance submitted by the  applicant
      applied  to  applications  made  after  2  March  2015  and  was  not,
      therefore, relevant to a December 2013 application. He took me through
      the application form in which the applicant had claimed 35 points  for
      his degree and 40 points for earnings of �38,330. A breakdown of  this
      income had been provided which showed that �29,256 came from  HLA.  He
      signed the declaration to confirm the  information  was  complete  and
      true. He also relied on invoices to HLA which demonstrated that he was
      not an employee. Had he been  an  employee  of  HLA,  he  should  have
      submitted payslips. His application, however, was that  he  was  self-
      employed by HLA and that his profits for the relevant period had  been
      over  �29,000.  Mr  Malik  confirmed  no  issue  was  taken  over  the
      applicant's employment with Chicken Cabins where he worked as a chef.


  15. Mr  Malik  submitted  that  it  was  not  possible  to  reconcile  the
      information in the application form with the information  on  his  tax
      returns. The tax return for 2012/2013, which would have  covered  just
      over three months in 2013 when the applicant was self-employed, showed
      a profit of just �4289. The tax return for the  following  year  which
      would  have  covered  the  remainder  of  the  self-employment  income
      declared to the respondent, with the exception of the last four months
      of the tax year, showed a profit of �6978. That  demonstrated  that  a
      large proportion of the income claimed to the respondent was  missing,
      even taking into account  that  income  for  4  months  had  not  been
      factored into the equation. The figures, therefore, showed that he had
      either chosen not to declare his full  income  to  HMRC  in  order  to
      reduce his tax liability or that he had misrepresented the figures  to
      the  respondent.  The  statement  of  Elizabeth  Morris  of  HMRC  was
      consistent with  the  figures  Mr  Malik  had  cited  in  submissions.
      Additionally, they accorded with the figures in the tax  returns.  The
      relevant sum for assessment had to  cover  profit  and  not  turnover.
      There was a clear discrepancy between the  information  given  to  the
      respondent and to HMRC.


  16. Mr Malik submitted that the explanation offered by the  applicant  was
      not believable and did not assist him.  The  applicant  had  tried  to
      explain that the sum of the turnover and employment income amounted to
      over �35,000 but the turnover figure was of no relevance. Moreover, in
      his application, he had declared profits and not the turnover.  Whilst
      it is claimed that part  of  his  self-employment  earnings  had  been
      declared as employment income with HLA, he  had  told  the  respondent
      that he was self-employed with HLA. It was not possible for him to  be
      both. Moreover, if he had been an employee of HLA, then  he  had  been
      required to produce payslips. These had  not  been  forthcoming.  With
      respect to the explanation that HLA had erroneously completed his  tax
      forms, Mr Malik submitted that HLA would not have erroneously declared
      him to be their employee. The decision letter set out the  figures  he
      had just referred to. The tax return had been filed late for 2013/2014
      but the respondent acknowledged in her letter that he had  declared  a
      profit of �6978 for that period.


  17. In the light of the information from HMRC, Mr Malik submitted that  it
      was reasonably open for the respondent to conclude that the  applicant
      had been dishonest. No explanation had been before the respondent  and
      the new information was inadmissible. However, even  if  the  Tribunal
      considered all the information now available, the decision  could  not
      be impugned. The decision was rational and correct.


  18. On the second  point  made  on  behalf  of  the  applicant,  Mr  Malik
      submitted  that  there  had  been  no   procedural   unfairness.   The
      administrative review process required that only evidence  before  the
      respondent could be reviewed. Mr Malik submitted that the flaw in  the
      applicant's argument was  that  the  respondent  had  relied  only  on
      material from the applicant. It was the applicant  who  had  completed
      the application form and the tax returns and he would have been  aware
      of the discrepancy between them. There was no unfairness in relying on
      evidence that he had supplied. Mr Malik submitted that  in  accordance
      with the authorities, the "gist of the evidence" was  communicated  to
      the applicant in the decision and there had been no obligation on  the
      part of the respondent to disclose her  concerns  to  him  before  the
      refusal. If he  had  an  explanation  and  wanted  to  adduce  further
      evidence, it would have been open to him to have made  representations
      to the respondent. His explanation, however, was unsatisfactory in any
      event. The authorities relied on in support of the unfairness argument
      did not assist  in  the  circumstances  of  this  application  because
      different considerations applied to those cases. With respect  to  the
      argument that the applicant expected he would be treated in  the  same
      way as he had been before, Mr Malik submitted there was no information
      as to why the applicant had been interviewed previously or what he had
      been questioned about. On this occasion the  respondent  had  the  tax
      returns, noticed the  discrepancy  and  was  under  no  obligation  to
      interview him about it. Mr Malik pointed out that  the  applicant  had
      attended the Home Office in person and had been given a  questionnaire
      to complete on which he confirmed that his self-employment  income  as
      declared to HMRC was correct. His challenges to the decision should be
      refused.


  19. With respect to the second limb of the decision, that  the  respondent
      was not satisfied that the current earnings  were  genuine,  Mr  Malik
      pointed out that there had been no challenge to that  in  the  grounds
      for judicial review. He pointed out that it  had  not  been  contended
      that there was not a discrepancy between the figures presented and  on
      that basis regardless of honesty or  dishonesty,  the  respondent  was
      entitled to doubt his most recently claimed  earnings.  The  applicant
      had not engaged with this point. The claim should be dismissed.


  20. Ms Tobin responded.  She  repeated  that  there  had  been  procedural
      unfairness. The applicant had not been dishonest. There  had  been  an
      error in 2013 where the applicant had put in turnover  figures  rather
      than earnings but he had offered a reasonable  explanation  for  this.
      There had been a lack of care in preparing  the  form.  There  was  no
      inconsistency in the tax figures. He had explained  that  HLA  was  at
      fault for declaring part of his  self-employment  as  employment.  She
      repeated that the applicant would have obtained enough points even  on
      the different figures. The full employment sum had to  be  taken  into
      account  with  the  self-employment   figures.   Common-law   fairness
      principles applied in all kinds of cases. The rules had  been  met  in
      2013. She submitted that none of the documents submitted in  the  last
      application had been questioned by the respondent.  All  the  required
      documents had been provided. There had been  an  innocent  explanation
      for the error. The applicant had always paid the right amount  of  tax
      whichever way the income had been declared. Although  his  tax  return
      for 2013/2014 had been submitted late, there had been no reason not to
      include that  information  in  the  decision  letter  which  had  been
      prepared after its submission. The applicant had  no  other  effective
      remedy. There had been no opportunity for him to put forward a logical
      explanation.


  21. Ms Tobin submitted that the second limb of the refusal flowed from the
      dishonesty finding so that if the Tribunal found for the applicant  on
      the fairness issue, then the rest of the decision fell with it because
      there was no other basis for that part of the refusal.  She  submitted
      that the figures were complex and they should be considered as a whole
      with all the documentation. A logical explanation  had  been  provided
      and the applicant should have been given the opportunity to respond to
      the  respondent's  concerns.  There  had  been  no   dishonesty.   The
      respondent acted unlawfully in the exercise of her discretion and  the
      decision should be quashed.


  22. That completed the submissions. I then reserved my decision.


Analysis and conclusions

  23. I have taken full account of the evidence and  the  submissions  made.
      The following authorities were submitted by the parties  although  not
      all were relied on in their submissions; MM (unfairness; E & R)  Sudan

      authorities  and  the  bundles  from  both  the  applicant   and   the
      respondent, I was also provided a copy of the rules as they applied to
      the December 2013 application and guidance on Tier 1 applications  for
      applications made on or after 2 March 2015. Ms Tobin stated  that  the
      guidance applicable to the December  2013  application  contained  the
      same content but there is nothing before me to confirm that.  I  have,
      however, taken it into account. I have  considered  all  the  evidence
      although every item may not be referred to in this decision.  I  reach
      the following conclusions.


  24. In order to qualify for indefinite leave to remain under  the  Tier  1
      (General) Migrant scheme, the applicant had  to  demonstrate  that  he
      qualified for 75 points. He sought 35 points for his Master's  degree,
      40 points for earning an income from either  employment  and/or  self-
      employment of between �35,000-�39,999.99, 5 points for UK  experience,
      20 points for age, 10 points for the English language requirement  and
      10 points for maintenance; a total of  120  points.  The  requirements
      were for earnings in the form of a salary  or  wages  to  be  assessed
      before  tax  and  for  earnings  derived  through  self-employment  or
      business  to  be  the  profits  of  that  business/work   (Attributes:
      paragraphs 24 and 25 and Guidance at paragraphs 91-92). The  applicant
      detailed earnings of �38,330.73 for the period between 1 January  2013
      and  30  November  2013;  �31,776.32  for  self-employment  (of  which
      �29,256.32 emanates  from  HLA)  and  �6,554.41  for  employment  with
      Chicken Cabins. I fully appreciate that the figures cover part of  two
      tax years.


  25. In  support  of  his  claimed  earnings,  the  applicant  adduced  his
      passport, degree certificate, language certificate,  bank  statements,
      invoices to HLA and other companies for whom  he  claimed  to  provide
      accountancy services, payslips and letters from his clients  regarding
      his self-employment. These documents give rise to some difficulties.


  26. The letter from HL Accountants (HLA) dated 5  December  2013  confirms
      that the applicant is their client, that his employment income was  as
      claimed above and  that  his  self-employment  figures  were:  �29,256
      turnover and �29,946 profit. I do not  follow  how  a  profit  can  be
      larger  than  turnover  and  I  note,  further,  that  the  figure  of
      �29,256.32 profit declared by the applicant in  his  application  form
      contradicts the profit figure provided  by  HLA.  The  higher  sum  is
      recorded in the income and expenditure account of  the  same  date  as
      Excess of Income over Expenditure. The letter from Modern Foods  of  4
      December 2013 confusingly maintains both that the applicant  has  been
      working for the company as an accountant since June 2012  and  between
      December 2012 and May 2013. The letter from  Systech  Computers  of  2
      December 2013 confirms that  they  have  been  using  the  applicant's
      services since November 2012. The applicant's  evidence  was  that  he
      registered as self-employed on 1 January 2013. This  is  confirmed  by
      the letter from his representatives dated  14  December  2016  and  by
      HMRC.


  27. At his appointment with  the  respondent  on  10  February  2016,  the
      applicant confirmed that his self-assessment tax  returns  filed  with
      HMRC correctly reflected his self-employment income.


  28. Enquiries by the respondent  made  of  HMRC  revealed  that  no  self-
      employment income was  declared  for  the  tax  year  2013/2014.  This
      appears to be because the applicant filed his  tax  return  late.  The
      respondent did, however take account of an SAE302 for  that  tax  year
      2013/2014 which showed a self-employment profit of �6,978.  The  total
      income declared from self-employment and  employment  was  �13,105.78.
      HMRC also confirmed that the applicant had declared �5,048  for  self-
      employment turnover with �4289 as self-employment net income  for  the
      tax year 2012/2013. Whilst Ms Tobin  takes  issue  with  contradictory
      figures cited in the  documentation  from  HMRC  and  the  GCID  notes
      (although the GCID self-employment figures tally with  those  set  out
      above), I have taken  the  figures  cited  by  the  applicant  in  his
      application form and in his tax returns and other supporting evidence.
      Whatever the respondent may have noted, incorrectly or  otherwise,  in
      her notes, the evidence before her  was  that  provided  by  HMRC  and
      consisted of evidence from the  applicant  in  the  form  of  his  tax
      returns which he confirmed to be correct both to  HMRC  on  submission
      and to the respondent at his appointment.




  29. Taking the figures  supplied  by  the  applicant  for  self-employment
      between 1 January 2013 (when his self-employment allegedly  commenced)
      and  31  November  2013,  his  application  form  shows  a  profit  of
      �31,776.32. His tax return for 2012/2013 declares self-employment  net
      income (for the period 1 January 2013 - 5 April 2013) as  �4289.  This
      is confirmed in the schedule prepared by  his  representatives  on  14
      December 2016 and tallies with the sum declared to HMRC. As  confirmed
      in  the  respondent's  detailed  grounds  of  defence,  no  issue  is,
      therefore, taken with that period. There are however difficulties with
      the subsequent period.


  30. I now proceed to the 2013/14 tax year. The applicant declared a profit
      of �6978 in self-employment for that entire tax year to  HMRC  (Bundle
      A, p. 60 and Bundle B, p. 73). That is  over  �20,000  less  than  his
      declared self-employment to the respondent just for the period April -
      November 2013 (having deducted the undisputed sum  of  �4289  for  the
      relevant part of the previous tax year; see paragraph  above  and  the
      declared profit for the 2013/2014 year).  Even taking into account the
      disputed sum of �6400 from HLA (if  it  was  genuine  self-employment)
      there is still a large discrepancy.


  31. The applicant has sought to explain the inconsistency and, it must  be
      said, that despite Ms Tobin's submissions to the  contrary,  there  is
      clearly  a  substantial  discrepancy.  The  difficulty  is  that  four
      different explanations  have  been  provided.  In  his  administrative
      review, he maintained that he had an arrangement with HLA to split his
      income between employment and self-employment  earnings;  that  is  to
      say, a portion of his self-employment income was treated  as  salaried
      income. No reason has been provided for why this was done. Nor does he
      explain why he would not have clarified  this  on  his  December  2013
      application form if this were the  case.  I  do  note,  that  on  that
      occasion the applicant provided invoices to support his claimed  self-
      employment  from  HLA  so  why  he  should  make  a  wholly  different
      declaration to HMRC remains unresolved. A  letter  dated  17  February
      2016 from HLA (which was not before the respondent when she  made  her
      decision but was written in response to it) also seeks to explain  the
      matter but, in my view, only  creates  further  concerns  in  that  it
      refers to HLA as the applicant's employer and  confirms  that  tax  on
      part of his income was paid by them via PAYE. I  do  not  follow  that
      explanation. As Mr Malik submitted, HLA cannot be employer and  client
      at the same time and would not make a PAYE payment for a self-employed
      person.  The third explanation provided in the letter of  14  December
      2016 from the applicant's solicitors is that  HLA  submitted  the  tax
      returns and erroneously recorded �6400 as employment with them  rather
      than  as  self-employment.   Even  if  that   were   true,   and   the
      circumstances in which the error occurred have not been explained, the
      discrepancy still exists (see above). As noted by Upper Tribunal Judge
      P Lane  when  refusing  the  paper  application  for  permission,  the
      explanation  was  "seriously  problematic".  The  fourth  explanation,
      provided  in  Ms  Tobin's  submissions  was  that  the  applicant  had
      erroneously declared his gross turnover to the respondent rather  than
      his profits. That is a new explanation. Had  the  applicant  genuinely
      made an innocent mistake, I would have expected  him  to  be  able  to
      provide one consistent explanation instead of four different ones.


  32. The issue before me is not whether the applicant qualified  under  the
      rules but whether the respondent was reasonably entitled  to  conclude
      that he had been dishonest in making his claim. It is not  for  me  to
      consider whether the applicant would have acquired  sufficient  points
      for a grant of leave  even  if  the  lower  figures  were  taken  into
      account. There may be many reasons why a claim to be  employed  rather
      than self-employed was made; the former may carry more  benefits  than
      the latter, but it is not my  role  to  speculate  on  that.  I  have,
      therefore, focused on the rationality and legality of the respondent's
      decision given the information she had.


  33. I find the respondent was fully entitled to make enquires of  HMRC  or
      any other organisation and that the applicant would have been aware of
      this possibility both from the guidance he seeks to rely on and, as  a
      result  of,  the  questionnaire  he  signed  at  his  appointment   at
      Sheffield.


  34. I do not accept that there was any procedural unfairness in a decision-
      making process which did  not  involve  prior  consultation  with  the
      applicant. The applicant is under  a  duty  to  provide  truthful  and
      correct information to all government departments. He  has  experience
      of accountancy himself  and  so  the  completion  of  tax  returns  or
      checking them if he did not complete them himself would  have  been  a
      simple matter for him. The respondent relied only on material supplied
      by the applicant  himself,  albeit  to  another  department.  She  was
      entitled to expect the information to tally with the figures  declared
      by the applicant in his application form. There was no  obligation  on
      her to ask the applicant for  an  explanation  or  to  interview  him.
      Indeed, after his last experience, I would have expected the applicant
      to be even more careful about the  information  and  evidence  he  put
      forward to government  departments  so  that  he  did  not  experience
      further problems. The authorities relied on by Ms Tobin do not support
      the  submission  that  the  respondent  acted  unfairly  as   in   the
      circumstances  of  the  present  case,  it  was  the  applicant's  own
      inconsistent evidence which led to the refusal of his application. The
      applicant's  complaint  that  the  results  of  the  checks  were  not
      disclosed to him is without merit. All the figures relied upon by  the
      respondent were set out in her decision letter so  the  applicant  was
      well  aware  of  the  "gist  of  the  evidence"  (Mehmood  and   Ali).
      Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume that he and/or his accountants
      would have had copies of all the tax returns he had submitted  so  the
      figures  could  have  easily  been  checked.  I  also  note  that  the
      respondent's guidance makes  it  plain  that  further  checks  may  be
      undertaken with other organisations on documents supplied.


  35. The applicant complains  that  paragraph  322(5)  is  a  discretionary
      ground of refusal and that the kind of conduct he is accused of is not
      listed in the guidance on the application of  this  provision.  It  is
      argued that fact, along with  the  respondent's  discretionary  power,
      should have led her to give the applicant an opportunity to respond to
      the allegation  prior  to  the  refusal.  The  guidance  includes  the
      following:


"When deciding whether to refuse under this category, the key thing to
consider is if there is reliable evidence to support a decision that the
person's behaviour calls into question their character and/or conduct
and/or their associations to the extent that it is undesirable to allow
them to enter or remain in the UK".

  36. The evidence before the respondent plainly showed a discrepancy in the
      figures declared by the applicant to HMRC and  those  claimed  in  his
      application to the respondent. His explanation, even if correct,  only
      serves to  confirm  that  incorrect  figures  were  declared  to  HMRC
      regardless of the intention or objective. It cannot be argued that the
      respondent  acted  unlawfully  in  holding  that  his  character  was,
      therefore, questionable for the purposes of paragraph 322(5) and  that
      she was not prepared to exercise her discretion in his  favour.  There
      was no obligation on her to allow the  applicant  to  respond  to  her
      allegations  prior  to  the  refusal  particularly  as  he   had   the
      opportunity to provide an explanation  in  the  administrative  review
      subsequently offered to him or by way  of  subsequent  representations
      when he could have submitted further documentary evidence. Even taking
      that evidence into account, however, the applicant has still not  made
      out his case.


  37. Finally, there is the second limb of the refusal.  As  the  respondent
      was entitled to conclude that the applicant had been dishonest in  his
      dealings with a government department (whichever one that may be), she
      was entitled to dispute the reliability of the earnings claimed in the
      recent application. The refusal  under  paragraph  245CD(e)  is  fully
      justified and discloses no illegality.


  38. Given all the circumstances, I conclude that the Secretary of  State's
      decision to  refuse  the  application  was  reasonable,  rational  and
      discloses no public law error.


Order

  39. I order that the judicial review application be refused



      Costs


  40. The applicant shall pay  the  respondent's  reasonable  costs,  to  be
      assessed if not agreed.


Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

  41. The applicant's grounds have already been addressed in this  judgment.
      The applicant accepts that discrepant figures  were  put  forward.  On
      that basis alone, the respondent's decision was reasonably made, there
      being no duty  on  her  to  ask  the  applicant  for  an  explanation.
      Permission to appeal is refused.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
