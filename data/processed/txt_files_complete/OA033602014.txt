For the Respondent:    Mr Lawrence Tarlow, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Bowler  sitting  at  Hatton  Cross  on  27
    February 2015) dismissing her appeal against the decision by  an  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  (Bangkok)  to  refuse  her  application  for  entry
    clearance as the partner of a person present and settled  here  on  the
    ground that she had failed to provide all the  mandatory  documentation
    and information required under Appendix  FM  -  SE  to  show  that  her
    sponsor's income was at least �18,600 per annum before tax.  The First-
    tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction,  and  I  do  not
    consider that the appellant requires to be accorded anonymity for these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 2. On 13 August 2015 the Upper Tribunal granted the  appellant  permission
    to appeal for the following reasons:

         "It may be that the failure to provide with the application all  of
         the documentary evidence demanded by Appendix FM - SE was  properly
         found to be fatal to the application.  However, given what  appears
         to be a clear finding of fact made by the judge  that,  as  at  the
         date of the decision, the sponsor's income exceeded  �18,600  p.a.,
         taken together with the issuing of second  and  subsequent  refusal
         letter and some ambiguity as to whether an  adjournment  was  being
         sought, it may be that the decision to dismiss the appeal discloses
         arguable error."

Relevant Background

 3. The appellant and the sponsor did not have the benefit of legal  advice
    when either preparing the application, or preparing the case on appeal.
     The application was initially  refused  on  5  February  2014  on  the
    ground, inter  alia,  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  income
    threshold requirement of Appendix  FM  and/or  the  related  evidential
    requirements under Appendix FM -  SE.   In  respect  of  her  husband's
    salaried employment in the UK,  she  provided  none  of  the  following
    specified information: her sponsor's P60 for  the  relevant  period  or
    periods if issued; wage slips covering a period of six months prior  to
    the date of application; employment letter from  Middleton  Maintenance
    Services confirming her husband's employment and gross  annual  salary,
    the length of his employment, the period over which they  had  been  or
    were being paid the level of salary relied upon in the application, and
    the type of employment; signed contract of  employment  with  Middleton
    Maintenance Services; monthly personal bank statements corresponding to
    the same period as the wage slips showing that the salary had been paid
    into an account in the name of her  husband  or  in  the  name  of  her
    husband and her jointly.

 4. As the appellant had not provided all, or indeed any, of the  specified
    documentation, the Entry Clearance Officer said  he  was  not  able  to
    assess on the balance of probabilities  if  her  sponsor's  income  was
    sufficient to meet the financial requirements of  the  Rules.   But  no
    final determination was made at this stage, because the courts have not
    yet decided the outcome of the Secretary of State's appeal in  a  legal
    challenge to the income threshold requirement.  If she appealed against
    the refusal decision, a final determination as to whether she  met  the
    income threshold and/or related evidential requirements under the Rules
    might be made at a later stage.   In  making  any  such  determination,
    account  would  be  taken  of  any  further  information  or  documents
    regarding the income threshold and/or related  evidential  requirements
    which she enclosed with her appeal.

 5. In her grounds of appeal, the  appellant  said  she  realised  that  in
    hindsight there were some areas lacking in  supporting  evidence.   She
    furnished a substantial bundle of documents with the notice of  appeal,
    including bank statement issued in February  2014  in  respect  of  the
    sponsor's account with Metro  Bank,  contract  of  employment  dated  9
    October 2012, and six payslips covering the period 31  August  2013  to
    end of January 2014.  In the Explanatory Statement, headed  "additional
    sheet (Section D)" the appellant addressed the question of  finance  on
    the second page.  She said that John had not been issued with  his  P60
    yet.  John was a  permanent  salaried  member  of  staff  at  Middleton
    Maintenance Services, as evidenced by the signed and dated contract  of
    employment.  He was providing bank  statements  showing  John's  salary
    going into his bank account from Middleton Maintenance and at (page  M)
    a corresponding payslip of this payment.

 6. It is convenient to note at this stage that no explanation was provided
    in the  Explanatory  Statement  as  to  why  there  was  no  letter  of
    employment from Middleton Maintenance  Services.   There  was  also  no
    explanation as to why there were no bank statements prior  to  February
    2014, and thus no bank statements showing the sponsor  being  paid  his
    monthly salary prior to February 2014.

 7. On 3 March 2015 Fiona  Paterson,  Entry  Clearance  Manager,  gave  her
    reasons for maintaining the refusal decision  despite  the  grounds  of
    appeal  and  the  documents  submitted  with  the  appeal.   The   bank
    statements showed only the sponsor's transactions over  February  2014.
    No previous  bank  statements  had  been  provided.   The  sponsor  had
    therefore failed to provide bank statements corresponding to  his  wage
    slips or showing that his income  payments  for  six  months  had  been
    deposited into his account.  Also, the  sponsor  had  not  provided  an
    employer's letter setting out  the  necessary  employment  information.
    The appellant  had  therefore  failed  to  provide  all  the  mandatory
    documentation and information required under Appendix FM-SE.

 8. Attached to the ECM appeal review was a new  refusal  notice  dated  14
    January 2015, which was said to have been  sent  to  the  applicant  by
    email on  3  February  2015.   The  new  refusal  notice  repeated  the
    evidential deficiencies which had been identified by the  Visa  Officer
    on 6 February 2014, with the qualification  that  two  of  the  missing
    items of evidence were optional,  namely  the  sponsor's  P60  and  the
    contract of employment with Middleton Maintenance  Services.   The  new
    refusal decision acknowledged that the sponsor had now provided  a  set
    of payslips and a Metro bank statement showing the last 30 transactions
    on the account between 20 February 2014  and  28  February  2014.   But
    there was no employer's letter, and there were no monthly personal bank
    statements corresponding to the same period as the wage  slips  showing
    the salary had been paid into an account in the name of her sponsor.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The  appellant  was  not  legally  represented  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  Her sponsor, Mr Gorman, presented her case.  He submitted he
    had proved that his income exceeded �18,600 per year.  The  documentary
    evidence which the judge had before her included a copy of Mr  Gorman's
    annual tax summary for the year ended 5 April 2014  which  showed  that
    his  total  taxable  income  from  employment  for  the  tax  year  was
    �21,956.25.

10. Mr Gorman gave oral  evidence.   He  said  he  could  not  produce  the
    required bank statements because he had moved bank  in  January  [2014]
    and could not get copies of his old statements.  His employer  was  not
    prepared to write a letter.  When asked by Ms Ahmad on  behalf  of  the
    ECO about the number of payslips that were missing, Mr Gorman  said  he
    had not realised that they were missing.

11. In her subsequent decision, Judge  Bowler  found  Mr  Gorman  to  be  a
    credible witness.  But the appellant  had  not  provided  the  evidence
    required under Appendix FM-SE of the  Rules.   Whilst  the  annual  tax
    summary showed that Mr Gorman earned income in excess of  �18,600,  the
    required evidence in the form of payslips,  an  employer's  letter  and
    bank statements  had  not  been  provided.   Payslips  for  August  and
    September 2013 had been provided but payslips for April  to  July  2013
    were missing.  There was only one bank  statement  for  February  2014.
    There was a copy of Mr Gorman's contract of employment, but  no  letter
    from his employer setting out the required information:

         "I am not able simply to have regard to the evidence of  the  level
         of  Mr  Gorman's  income.   As  the  evidence  required  under  the
         Immigration Rules has not  been  provided,  the  appeal  under  the
         Immigration Rules does not succeed."

The Application for Permission to Appeal

12. In the grounds seeking permission to appeal, Mr Gorman said he did  not
    receive the new refusal notice  dealing  with  the  outstanding  points
    regarding the income threshold requirement until 24 February, which was
    three days before the court hearing on 27 February.  He  then  did  not
    have the time to  go  through  the  papers  and  provide  the  relevant
    documents for the court.

13. Following an initial refusal of permission  issued  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, Mr Gorman said in his renewed application for permission that
    until three days before the court hearing, he was of  the  belief  that
    the financial  documents  he  had  submitted  within  the  bundle  were
    sufficient and correct, and that he had adhered to Appendix FM.  He was
    never informed otherwise.  He had thoroughly read Appendix FM,  and  as
    far as he was concerned he  had  sent  all  seven  payslips  that  were
    required to the First-tier Tribunal on 1 March  2014.   The  first  and
    only answer he had received from the Entry Clearance Officer in Bangkok
    was the one three days before the court hearing.  He was  working  flat
    out at this time, and therefore was unable to sort out anything in time
    for the court hearing.  He felt the judge  should  have  adjourned  the
    hearing to at least give him time to sort out what was still  required.
    He was now submitting payslips for  the  period  asked  for,  and  bank
    statements for the same period.

The Rule 24 Response

14. On 2 September 2015 a member of the Specialist Appeals Team  settled  a
    Rule 24 response opposing the appeal.   The  judge  had  made  detailed
    reasoned findings on the limited evidence before her, and the  findings
    were ones which were open to her to make.  She was  not  asked  at  any
    stage to adjourn the hearing.   The  appellant  was  fully  aware  what
    documents were required at the time of application.

Discussion

15. There is no discernible error in  the  judge's  reasoning.   While  the
    annual tax summary showed that Mr Gorman was earning an  annual  income
    in excess of �18,600, not all of the mandatory  evidence  specified  in
    Appendix FM-SE had been provided to show that  the  appellant  met  the
    income threshold.  As the judge rightly directed herself, she could not
    re-write the Rules.  On the evidence before her she was constrained  to
    dismiss the appeal under the Rules.

16. The only arguable basis on which the First-tier Tribunal Judge could be
    said to have erred in law is on the ground  that  it  was  procedurally
    unfair for her to dismiss the appeal without giving Mr Gorman a further
    opportunity by way of an adjournment to provide the specified documents
    necessary for the appeal to succeed.

17. However, having conducted a full enquiry into this matter, I am  wholly
    unpersuaded that the appellant and the sponsor  have  been  victims  of
    procedural unfairness.

18. The initial refusal decision, against  which  the  appellant  appealed,
    made it very clear what documents needed to be  provided  in  order  to
    satisfy the evidential requirements to  demonstrate  a  minimum  annual
    income of �18,600.  Unfortunately, the sponsor did not understand these
    requirements.  In particular, he appears not to  have  appreciated  the
    need to provide exactly what was specified,  not  merely  some  of  the
    documents that were specified.

19. There was a time lag of about a year between the service of the  notice
    of appeal and the accompanying documents,  and  the  anxiously  awaited
    response of an Entry Clearance Manager.  When the  response  did  reach
    the sponsor, it should not have come as a surprise.  It was  always  on
    the cards that the refusal was going  to  be  maintained  on  financial
    grounds as the documentary evidence which had been  provided  with  the
    notice of appeal  fell  very  far  short  of  what  was  required.   In
    particular, there were no bank statements for the period  corresponding
    to the run of payslips; and, moreover, the payslips did not  cover  the
    required period, which was six months prior to the date of application,
    as opposed to six months prior to the date of decision.

20. A further point of potential significance is that  in  the  Explanatory
    Statement which accompanied the notice of appeal the  sponsor  did  not
    inform the respondent that he was unable to obtain an employment letter
    or that he could not easily produce bank statements  for  the  relevant
    period, as he had moved to a new bank in  January  2014.   So,  on  the
    evidence available to the Entry Clearance Officer and also to the Entry
    Clearance Manager, there was no trigger for the exercise of  discretion
    under the evidential flexibility provisions set out at the beginning of
    Appendix FM-SE.

21. Mr Gorman did not seek an  adjournment  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Bowler, because he wrongly believed that  he  had  provided  sufficient
    evidence for the appeal to succeed.  Understandably,  but  erroneously,
    he believed that the disclosure of an annual tax summary  for  the  tax
    year ending April 2014 would carry the day.  In addition, it was not Mr
    Gorman's case before the First-tier Tribunal that if he was given  more
    time, he could provide documents that were missing.  He told the  Judge
    that he could not provide copies of his old bank statements,  and  that
    his employer was not prepared to write a letter.  In the circumstances,
    the judge acted fairly and reasonably in not adjourning the hearing  of
    her own motion.

22. Accordingly, for the above reasons,  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not contain an error of law, and the decision stands.  The
    way forward for the appellant is to make a fresh application, in  which
    she provides up-to-date  evidence  of  the  sponsor  earning  at  least
    �18,600 per annum.  This should not  present  any  difficulty,  as  the
    sponsor now has a clear understanding of what he needs to produce.  One
    potential obstacle that I discussed with the sponsor at the hearing was
    the provision of a letter of employment.   It  is  important  that  the
    sponsor explains to the Entry Clearance Officer why such an  employment
    letter is not being provided, so as to trigger  an  obligation  on  the
    part of the Entry Clearance Officer to  exercise  discretion  to  waive
    compliance with that particular requirement.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-Tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and accordingly the decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
