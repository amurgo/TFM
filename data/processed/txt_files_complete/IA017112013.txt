For the Appellant:     Mr Ficklin instructed by Mohammed & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Presenting Officer


                  DISPOSAL OF PROCEEDINGS BY WAY OF CONSENT

 1. On hearing from Counsel for  the  appellant  and  a  Senior  Presenting
    Officer for the respondent and by the consent of the parties

    IT IS ORDERED THAT:

    (1)  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal dated 13  March  2013
         (promulgated 18 March 2013) is  set  aside  on  the  basis  of  the
         application of the  post-9  July  2012  Immigration  Rules  by  the
         Secretary of State for the Home Department in a decision  dated  19
         December 2013 was unlawful.

    (2)  By consent,  the  appellant's  application  for  leave  to  remain
         outside the Immigration Rules dated 7 July 2012 remains outstanding
         with the Secretary of State for the Home Office.

    (3)  Further considerations will take  place  in  accordance  with  the
         Immigration  Rules  and  policy  as  they  stood  at  the  date  of
         application with reference to Part 5A of the Immigration Act 2014.

2.   Accordingly this  brings  to  an  end  the  proceedings  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.




Signed                                  Date 13 November 2014
