                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I make  an  order  prohibiting  the  disclosure  or
    publication of any matter likely to  lead  members  of  the  public  to
    identify the respondent. Breach of this order  can  be  punished  as  a
    contempt of court. I  make  the  order  because  the  respondent  is  a
    vulnerable asylum seeker who might be at risk just by reason  of  being
    identified.

 1. The appellant (hereafter the Secretary of State)  appeals  against  the
    decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Sethi)  allowing   the
    respondent's appeal against a decision taken on 30 July 2014 to  refuse
    the respondent's human rights claim and to remove the  respondent  from
    the UK. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the  respondent's  appeal  on
    asylum and humanitarian protection grounds. This decision  confirms  my
    oral decision on 23 October 2015 to dismiss the appeal of the Secretary
    of State.

Introduction

 2. The respondent is a citizen of Sri Lanka born in  1978.  He  claims  to
    have been a victim of torture in prison from 2004 to 2008 when  he  was
    repeatedly tortured and abused until his release was secured by a bribe
    from his mother who sold her land to  raise  funds.  He  was  medically
    examined in the UK  and  he  has  received  support  from  the  Medical
    Foundation,  his  local  Community  Mental  Health  Team   (CMHT)   and
    medication but  remains  depressed  and  with  suicidal  ideation.  The
    respondent claims that he has attempted suicide many times in  the  UK.
    He would seek to take his own life rather than face  further  abuse  on
    return to Sri Lanka.

 3.  The  Secretary  of  State  accepted  the  respondent's  identity   and
    nationality but concluded that he had not been found  credible  in  his
    previous appeal determination from 2002 and he had  been  removed  from
    the UK on 16 March 2004. He returned to the UK  on  30  September  2008
    using  a  passport  in  a  false   identity.   He   submitted   further
    representations on 1 October 2008 which  were  refused  on  19  January
    2011. However, the respondent decided that further submissions made  in
    September 2012 did amount to a fresh claim. Torture and rape  were  not
    raised in the 2008 representations. There could be other causes for the
    scarring. The appellant was not at risk on return to Sri Lanka  because
    he was of no adverse interest to the authorities.

The Appeal

 4. The respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and attended an oral
    hearing at Taylor House on 26 June  2015.  He  was  represented  by  Ms
    Fisher. The First-tier Tribunal found that the respondent had  provided
    a credible account of his ill treatment at the hands of the Sri  Lankan
    authorities after being arrested and abused following his return to Sri
    Lanka in March 2004. He was detained at the airport  but  was  released
    after his personal details were taken. He went home  but  later  became
    estranged from his wife and was apprehended by police in  Colombo  when
    sleeping rough. He was further abused during this detention. The  judge
    was not satisfied that the respondent was held for  three  and  a  half
    years or that he was a person of any real  political  interest  to  the
    authorities. Enquiries would have revealed that he was a person  of  no
    interest and he would have been released  shortly  thereafter.  It  was
    plausible that the appellant was detained twice and ill treated but not
    that he was detained for almost four years at Welikade Prison. However,
    it was plausible that he was released on a bribe from a shorter  period
    of police custody with funds raised by his mother.

 5. Ms Fisher conceded in the First-tier that the respondent did  not  fall
    into any of the risk categories identified in GJ and others (post-civil
    war - returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013]. However, the judge found that the
    respondent's  mental  health  problems   were   directly   related   to
    experiences of serious ill treatment in Sri Lanka  and  that  his  fear
    that he would be at risk of a repeat of ill treatment was  subjectively
    very real and unrelenting. There was no reason to  doubt  the  credible
    medical opinion that the respondent would kill himself here rather than
    return and he would not be able to  recover  psychologically  from  his
    experiences as long as  he  felt  unsafe.  The  judge  found  that  the
    respondent and his wife were separated and that the respondent  had  no
    contact with her or his son from that relationship. His lack of contact
    with his mother was for  reason  of  his  sense  of  worthlessness  and
    failure. The respondent was destitute upon his return to Sri Lanka  and
    the pattern of destitution continued in the UK as he  had  been  mainly
    homeless throughout his time here. It was most unlikely that  he  would
    with his current mental health vulnerability be capable of  seeking  or
    securing access to the support or effective  treatment  that  he  would
    need in Sri Lanka even where such treatment would be available  and  so
    he would be in danger of a further deterioration of his mental  health.
    The high mental health concerns and real risk of suicide satisfied  the
    Article 3 threshold.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  by
    failing to carry out an assessment of adequate  medical  facilities  in
    Sri Lanka or to make findings on the  actions  of  the  authorities  if
    presented with a returnee in need of such assistance. Lack of family or
    friends does not mean that the respondent would not be afforded help if
    required. The respondent's claim that he would commit suicide in the UK
    goes against the fact that his condition is being supervised in such  a
    way that would prevent such an occurrence.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge White  on
    24 August 2015. It was arguable that the judge had failed adequately to
    identify the mental health facilities available to  the  respondent  in
    Sri Lanka and  whether  such  facilities  would  be  available  to  the
    respondent on return irrespective of whether the respondent sought them
    out.

 8. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

 9. Ms Savage confirmed that the only  issue  was  whether  the  judge  had
    properly assessed the risk of suicide. There was no attempt to consider
    mechanisms in the UK. There was inadequate consideration  of  treatment
    available in Sri Lanka. There was no clear finding about family support
    in Sri Lanka.

10. Ms Fisher submitted that there was nothing in the grant  of  permission
    about family support - the  findings  start  at  paragraph  17  of  the
    decision. The respondent is a homeless Tamil male and his ill treatment
    arose partly out of that. The judge obviously considered J [2005]  EWCA
    Civ 629 at paragraph 34 of the decision. Nothing has been  put  forward
    about practical arrangements for the respondent's return to Sri  Lanka.
    The case was never  about  the  quality  of  treatment  in  Sri  Lanka.
    Paragraph 36 of the decision is in accordance with the law  and  Y  and
    another [2009] EWCA Civ 362. The authorities have to be  put  into  the
    context of this respondent who has attempted suicide on four occasions.
    It is naï¿½ve to suggest that safeguards can be put into place. There  is
    no realistic prospect  of  the  respondent  engaging  with  psychiatric
    services in Sri Lanka. The  Article  3  findings  are  undisturbed  and
    paragraph 62 of Y has been correctly applied.

11. I note that the judge has made a series of findings of fact  that  have
    not been challenged. In particular, the judge found that the respondent
    was suffering from acute PTSD and was at high risk of  suicide  despite
    the current arrangements for supervision, counselling  and  medication.
    The  findings  of  fact  set  out  at  paragraphs  5-6  above  are  not
    challenged. The grant of permission does not extend  to  any  error  in
    relation to lack of family support.

12. I am satisfied that the judge  considered  and  correctly  applied  the
    principles set out in  J  and  Y.  The  respondent's  appeal  succeeded
    because the criteria in J were met and the risk of ill treatment  arose
    as a result of the removal process. The absence of family  support  was
    an additional factor. The judge accepted that the respondent's fear  of
    further ill treatment in Sri Lanka was directly related to past serious
    ill treatment. To that extent, his fear was  objectively  well-founded.
    The respondent did not rely upon the absence of effective mechanisms in
    Sri Lanka to reduce the risk of suicide. There was no obligation on the
    judge to assess mental health facilities in Sri Lanka.

13. Paragraphs 61-62 of Y are directly relevant. The Court of  Appeal  held
    that although some psychiatric care was  available  in  Sri  Lanka  the
    appellants were so traumatised by their experiences and so subjectively
    terrified at the prospect of return to the scene of their torment  that
    they would not be capable of seeking the treatment they needed. With no
    known family left in Sri Lanka and no home to travel to, the chances of
    their finding a secure base from  which  to  seek  the  palliative  and
    therapeutic care that would keep them from taking their own  lives  was
    on any admissible view of the evidence, remote. There comes a point  at
    which an undisturbed finding that an appellant has  been  tortured  and
    raped in captivity has to be conscientiously related  to  credible  and
    uncontradicted  expert  evidence  that  the  likely   effect   of   the
    psychological trauma if return is enforced will be suicide.

14. I find that the same considerations arise in this appeal. The judge has
    not misapplied the law. In fact, the judge has  precisely  adopted  the
    approach taken by the Court of Appeal in Y. That approach  cannot  give
    rise to a material error of law.

15. I have seen a letter dated 21 October 2015 from Dr Brady of  the  Helen
    Bamber Foundation stating that the respondent attempted  suicide  again
    on 13 October  2015  after  hearing  about  the  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  He  was  admitted  to  hospital  for  two  nights  and  then
    discharged to the care of a home treatment team. Nurses from  the  team
    have visited him twice daily to offer practical and  emotional  support
    and to monitor the safe administration of his  medication  due  to  the
    risk of the respondent overdosing on  his  prescribed  medication.  The
    respondent was assessed again in  hospital  after  having  overwhelming
    suicidal thoughts. I have not  found  it  necessary  to  consider  this
    further evidence in light of my decision that the  First-Tier  Tribunal
    did not err in law. However, the underlying reality  of  this  case  is
    wholly clear.

16. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  allow  the  respondent's
    appeal under Article 3 of the ECHR did not  involve  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and its decision stands.



Decision

17. Consequently, I dismiss the appeal of the Secretary of State.
