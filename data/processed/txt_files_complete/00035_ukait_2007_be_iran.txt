Centre
For the Respondent:          Mr T Eicke, instructed by Treasury Solicitor

(1)  Generally, and subject to the  additional  ground  identified  by  Lord
Bingham in Sepet and Bulbul, punishment for refusal to obey military  orders
will amount to persecution only if carrying out the act ordered  would  make
the individual (as  distinct  from  his  country)  liable  to  sanctions  in
international law, or would change his status in international  law  (eg  by
excluding him from protection as a refugee.  (2)  Other than  by  Convention
there is no international prohibition on the laying of landmines.  (3)   The
international law of armed conflict is  more  extensive  and  detailed  than
international law as it applies to situations  other  than  armed  conflict,
and it cannot be assumed that an act prohibited in armed  conflict  is  also
prohibited in peace.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The claim

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran.  He  left  Iran  and  came  to  the
    United Kingdom on 4 November 1999.   He claims to be  a  refugee  under
    the 1951 UN Convention relating to  the  Status  of  Refugees  and  the
    Protocol of 1967 on the basis that, if returned, he  will  be  punished
    (or killed) by the Iranian military  authorities  for  having  deserted
    from the Iranian army on being ordered to plant landmines in a civilian
    area in Iranian Kurdistan.

History of the appeal

 2. The appeal has a somewhat lengthy history.  The  appellant  arrived  in
    the United Kingdom on 4 November 1999 and claimed asylum.  On 30  March
    2001, the Secretary of State refused his application.   On  appeal,  an
    Adjudicator accepted the appellant's account but dismissed  the  appeal
    under the Refugee Convention  and  the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights.  The appellant's  further  appeal  to  the  Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal was unsuccessful.  However, on 12 June  2003  by  consent  the
    Court of Appeal remitted the appeal to the Tribunal.  Thereafter, on  8
    July 2004 the Tribunal dismissed the appellant's appeal  (BE  (Military
    Service - Punishment  -  Landmines)  Iran  [2004]  UKIAT  00183).   The
    Tribunal concluded that the appellant had failed to establish that  the
    conditions he would endure if imprisoned in Iran would reach the  level
    of severity required for a breach of article 3 of  the  ECHR.  The  IAT
    also held that the order which the appellant refused to  obey  was  not
    contrary to international law: either treaty law (because Iran was  not
    a party to any relevant treaty)  or  customary  international  law,  in
    particular Common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which  only
    applied in situations of war or armed conflict.  The Tribunal concluded
    on the facts that the order he was given was not in the  context  of  a
    war or situation of internal armed conflict.  Thus, the  appellant  had
    failed to establish that any punishment imposed upon him for failing to
    obey the order would amount to persecution within the  meaning  of  the
    1951 Convention.

 3. The appellant again appealed to  the  Court  of  Appeal  which,  on  13
    January 2005,  by  consent,  allowed  the  appeal,  setting  aside  the
    decision of the Tribunal, and so leaving the  appeal  to  the  Tribunal
    undetermined.  Following the commencement of the appeals provisions  of
    the 2004 Act, the grant of permission  to  appeal  to  the  Immigration
    Appeal Tribunal now takes effect as an order for reconsideration of the
    appeal by this Tribunal. The consent order is in the following terms:

        "The Secretary of State agrees that the IAT erred in law  and  that
        this  appeal  should  be  allowed  and  the  case  remitted  to   a
        differently constituted IAT, on the basis that:
              a) In the Court of Appeal judgment in  Krotov  v  SSHD  [2004]
                 EWCA Civ 69; [2004] INLR 304, the Court (at �38)  indicated
                 that courts must consider, when assessing such claims under
                 the refugee Convention, whether the appellant is or may  be
                 'required on a sufficiently  widespread  basis  to  act  in
                 breach of  the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct  generally
                 recognised by the international community' (�51);
              b) However, the IAT only considered the different and separate
                 question whether the actions the appellant was  ordered  to
                 undertake were lawful under international law;
              c) Further the Court indicated that, in times of peace,  those
                 'basic rules of human conduct generally recognised  by  the
                 international community; would  find  their  reflection  in
                 international human rights law  rather  than  international
                 humanitarian law:
                       '... human rights really concern  rights  enjoyed  by
                       all at all times, whereas humanitarian rules  concern
                       rights which protect individuals in armed  conflicts.
                       Most Conventions and other  documents  which  provide
                       for the protection of human rights (a) include a  far
                       wider variety of rights than the rights to protection
                       from murder, torture and degradation  internationally
                       recognised as set out above; (b) in any event contain
                       safeguards which exclude or modify the application of
                       such rights  in  time  of  war  and  armed  conflict'
                       [Krotov, �38]
              d) The IAT decided that in the present case there was no armed
                 conflict.  As a result, they  should  have  considered  the
                 position of a deserter in times of peace.
              e) However, the  IAT  has  only  considered  the  position  in
                 relation to international humanitarian law (i.e.  the  laws
                 of war) but has completely failed to consider the  position
                 under (wider) international law norms, and  failed  to  ask
                 itself the question identified by the Court  of  Appeal  in
                 ��37, 38 and 51 of the judgment in Krotov namely:
                      i)  What  are  the  'basic  rules  of  human  conduct
                         generally   recognised   by   the    international
                         community' in times of peace based on an  analysis
                         of the relevant international human rights norms?;
                         and/or
                     ii) In how far do the 'basic rules of  human  conduct'
                         applicable in times of conflict and identified  by
                         the Court of Appeal  in  its  judgment  of  Krotov
                         apply in times of peace?"


 4. The order makes clear that the scope of this reconsideration is limited
    in, at least, two respects.  First, it is restricted to the appellant's
    claim to be a refugee under the 1951 Convention.  The appellant's human
    rights claim is no longer in issue.  Second, the IAT's finding that the
    appellant was not engaged in war or an internal armed  conflict  stands
    and our concern is with what, if any, are the applicable provisions  of
    international law which apply in their absence.

 5. No reference was made in argument before us to the  provisions  of  the
    Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards  for
    the qualification and status of third country  nationals  or  stateless
    persons as refugees or as  persons  who  otherwise  need  international
    protection and the content of the protection granted, which  came  into
    force after the hearing and was in the UK implemented by the Refugee or
    Person in Need of International Protection (Qualification)  Regulations
    2006 (SI 2525/2006) and a Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, Cm
    6918.  So far as it concerns the appellant's claim to be a refugee,  we
    mention it below at the only point where in our view  it  is  relevant:
    see  paragraph  37.   The  subsidiary  protection  provisions  of   the
    Directive  (implemented  in  the   UK   as   provisions   relating   to
    'humanitarian protection') have no impact  on  this  appeal  given  the
    context in which we decide it.  Humanitarian  protection  is  available
    only to those who establish  a  risk  of  'serious  harm'  to  them  if
    returned to their own  country.   'Serious  harm'  is  defined  by  the
    Directive and by paragraph 339C of HC 395 (as amended): it suffices for
    present purposes to say that in  this  case  a  claim  to  humanitarian
    protection would add nothing to the claim under Article 3 of the  ECHR,
    which, as already indicated, is no longer in issue.

The facts

 6. With those matters in mind, we turn to consider the facts,  which  were
    not in dispute before us.  The essential facts are  crisply  stated  in
    paragraph [3] of the Tribunal's decision (BE) when the appeal was  last
    before it:


        "3.      ...  In 1998 the appellant did his military service. After
             two years he joined the regular army, becoming a sergeant.  His
             training was in the laying  and  removing  of  land  mines.  In
             September 1998 he was sent to Iranian Kurdistan based in  Paveh
             and Baneh where he spent two weeks. He  was  ordered  to  plant
             landmines but he refused  because  he  did  not  want  to  kill
             innocent people in Kurdistan. He escaped. After six  months  he
             was  arrested  and  tried  by  a  military  tribunal.   He  was
             sentenced to three months imprisonment  and  demoted.  In  June
             1999 he was sent back to Kurdistan as a  driver.  In  September
             1999 a colleague was killed by the army for refusing  to  plant
             landmines.  A week later he  was  ordered  to  plant  landmines
             again. After discussion with a friend  he  saw  his  choice  as
             being either to plant landmines as ordered or to desert.  Since
             he believed that to plant landmines would  endanger  civilians,
             he deserted. First he went into hiding and then came to the  UK
             via Turkey."

 7. In relation to the appellant, the IAT accepted two findings made by the
    Adjudicator.  First, at paragraph [20], it accepted that:


        "the appellant was trained to lay and remove landmines: it was  not
        a case, therefore, of a soldier who refused to plant landmines  per
        se."

 8. Then, at paragraph at paragraph [21] it accepted the finding, that:

        "the appellant had been ordered to plant landmines and had  refused
        because he genuinely  believed  it  might  lead  to  the  death  of
        innocent civilians."

 9. At paragraph 25 of his skeleton,  Mr  Eicke  identified  three  crucial
    matters in respect of the laying of landmines by the Iranian government
    which we did not understand Ms Webber to dispute.  First, at  paragraph
    [19] the IAT said this:

        "[There was a] lack of any specific objective evidence to show that
        at this particular time the Iranian authorities had  planted  anti-
        personnel land mines in this region with the deliberate  intent  of
        harming civilians or being reckless of harming them."

10. Secondly at paragraph [23], it said  relying  upon  the  Iran  Landmine
    Monitor Report 2003:

        "During the relevant period: (i)  the  Iranian  government,  whilst
        condemning landmines as inhumane weapons,  confirmed  that  it  has
        used and would go on using them  to  protect  its  borders  and  to
        combat drug smugglers and terrorists;   (ii)  areas  it  had  mined
        included the province of Kurdistan (the area  referred  to  by  the
        appellant);  and (iii)  there  have  been  civilian  casualties  in
        Kurdistan.


11. Finally,  Mr  Eicke  reminded  us  of  the  Adjudicator's  finding  (at
    paragraph [14] of his determination) that:

        "I could find nothing in the background  material  before  me  that
        suggests the Iranian government is targeting the  Kurdish  civilian
        population."

The starting point

12. This case is not about compulsory military service: the appellant is  a
    volunteer, not a conscript.  Nor, despite the introductory reference to
    such issues in para (a) of the Consent  Order,  is  it  about  military
    discipline in general or about the possibility that a soldier could  in
    the future be commanded to act against his conscience or  against  some
    rule of law.  The appellant fears the consequences of having refused in
    the past to obey specific orders.   Nevertheless,  our  starting  point
    must be the speech of Lord Bingham in Sepet and Bulbul v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2003] UKHL 15 at [8]:

        "There is compelling support  for  the  view  that  refugee  status
        should be accorded to one who has  refused  to  undertake  military
        service on the grounds that such service would or might require him
        to commit atrocities or gross human rights abuses or participate in
        a conflict condemned  by  the  international  community,  or  where
        refusal to serve would earn grossly excessive  or  disproportionate
        punishment."

13. This view comprises, as it seems to us, three limbs.   Translated  into
    the facts of this case they are: (i) refusal to obey the order  on  the
    ground  that  obedience  would  or  might  amount  to   commission   of
    'atrocities or gross human rights abuses'; (ii) refusal to obey on  the
    ground that obedience would mean participation in 'a conflict condemned
    by the international community'; and (iii) refusal to  obey  where  the
    refusal  itself  would  'earn  grossly  excessive  or  disproportionate
    punishment'.  If the appellant can show that his case falls  under  any
    of these he  shows  that  the  punishment  he  fears  would  amount  to
    persecution within the meaning of the Refugee Convention.

14. Limb (ii) clearly refers only to orders given and to be  obeyed  within
    the context of armed conflict; a  conflict  moreover  of  a  particular
    character.  In the present case the Immigration Appeal Tribunal decided
    that there was no armed conflict and the Order remitting this appeal to
    the Tribunal is specifically on that basis.  We  need  not,  therefore,
    concern ourselves with it.  Limb (iii) is not confined to circumstances
    of armed conflict.  The Adjudicator found that any punishment would  be
    for disobedience to military orders only, and  the  Immigration  Appeal
    Tribunal, applying Krotov v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2004] EWCA Civ 69  on  the  basis  of  conclusions  they  had  already
    reached, said this (at [40]-[41], emphasis added by us):

        "Since the order was not contrary to national or international law,
        it cannot be said either that  punishment  imposed  in  view  of  a
        refusal to obey it by way of desertion  would  be  illegitimate  or
        disproportionate.  Thus the punishment concerned would not  involve
        the infliction of serious harm either under the Refugee  Convention
        or Art 3.  Nor would  it  involve  flagrant  denial  of  any  other
        protected human right."

15. All issues under the European Convention on Human Rights  have,  as  we
    have  said,  fallen  away.   The  reasoning  of  this  passage  in  the
    Tribunal's determination is accepted, as it must be.  What Miss  Webber
    on behalf of the appellant does not accept is the starting point, which
    we have underlined in the passage cited above.  It is not said that the
    orders were contrary to Iranian law; but the appellant's case  is  that
    the orders were contrary to international law.


Atrocities or gross human rights abuses

16. Before looking at the precise characterisation  of  that  assertion  we
    must analyse limb (i).   As  expressed  by  Lord  Bingham,  it  is  not
    confined to situations of  armed  conflict.   Zolfagharkhani  v  Canada
    (1993) 3 FC 540, however, to which he refers and which appears to  have
    been his source for this part of his proposition, was a case  in  which
    the finding of fact was that there was an armed  conflict  in  progress
    (as it happens, between the Iranian government and Iranian  Kurds,  but
    within the context of the Iran-Iraq war).  In Krotov,  where  limb  (i)
    was explored, the context was again an armed conflict. It may  well  be
    that Lord Bingham intended the first limb  to  be  confined,  like  the
    second,  to  situations  of  armed  conflict.    We  are   nevertheless
    unwilling to make that assumption against the appellant in the  absence
    of clear words.  We therefore  proceed  on  the  assumption,  which  we
    recognise may be too generous to the appellant, that where there is, as
    in the present case, no armed conflict, the appellant can succeed if he
    shows that obedience to the orders would (or, to adopt the  formulation
    used by Lord Bingham in the context of the  whole  range  of  potential
    orders during a period of military service, might) have required him to
    commit atrocities or gross human rights abuses.

17. If the appellant can show that the very act that he was ordered  to  do
    amounts (or might amount) to an atrocity or to a gross abuse  of  human
    rights, he will  have  shown  that  the  feared  punishment  is  feared
    persecution.  Despite Miss Webber's eloquent attempts to  persuade  us,
    we do not accept that in this case the act can bear  that  description.
    As Mr Eicke pointed out, on the undisputed facts, the laying  of  mines
    was not directed at civilians or the Kurdish  community.   It  was  not
    part of any campaign against anybody.  The mine-laying is not shown  to
    have with   aggressive  intent,  nor  is  it  shown  that  the  Iranian
    government intended them to be detonated or for anybody to be  hurt  or
    was reckless as to such harm.  It is true that experience suggests that
    anti-personnel landmines have unintended and devastating  consequences,
    but that does not mean that every act of  laying  them  is  itself  the
    commission of an atrocity, or a gross human rights abuse.

18. The language chosen by Lord Bingham is clearly a language of  extremes.
    We were referred to the 'Berlin Wall' case, Streletz, Kessler and Krenz
    v Germany (2001) 33 EHRR 31, where landmines were used  as  part  of  a
    strategy preventing  the  free  movement  of  citizens  of  the  German
    Democratic Republic.  It is clear from the report  of  that  case  that
    officers were under orders to prevent the survival of those  minded  to
    cross the border.  As well as static defences such as razor wire, there
    were dogs, automatic weapons, landmines, and a policy  of  shooting  to
    kill, in order to 'annihilate border violators and protect  the  border
    at all costs'.  The language of atrocity and of gross abuse is  clearly
    appropriate to describe this  strategy;  and  we  do  not  exclude  the
    possibility that in  such  circumstances  every  participant  might  be
    regarded as implicated in the dreadful consequences of it.  Where there
    is no such strategy, however,  and  where  the  apprehended  breach  of
    another's human rights will, if it occurs  at  all,  be  an  unintended
    consequence of the acts in question, we consider that there will be  no
    'atrocity', nor can any breach of human rights be  called  'gross',  if
    the unintended event occurs.

19. So far as she relies directly on  Sepet  and  Bulbul,  therefore,  Miss
    Webber's argument fails.

Arguments beyond Sepet and Bulbul

20. Miss Webber also submits that in any event the act  of  planting  anti-
    personnel land mines is an act contrary to international law.  She does
    not base her submissions purely on an argument as to  the  atrocity  of
    the act or purely on arguments about human rights, although both  these
    elements feature at certain stages of  her  submissions.   Rather,  she
    argues that certain conduct, including for these purposes the  planting
    of such weapons, is prohibited by rules of international law, and  that
    it is the breach of the rules, rather than the effect  of  the  breach,
    that gives the appellant his claim.  She submits, in effect, that being
    required to do an act that is contrary to international law is a fourth
    possibility for the acquisition of  refugee status from refusal to obey
    military orders, to be added to the three identified by Lord Bingham in
    Sepet and Bulbul.  In order to maintain that submission in the  present
    appeal, she seeks to show that the act the appellant was  commanded  to
    perform  is  indeed  contrary  to  international  law.    She   invokes
    international humanitarian law, an a  fortiori  argument,  an  argument
    based on Art 1F of the Refugee Convention, customary international law,
    and international human rights or 'the basic  rules  of  human  conduct
    generally recognised by the international community'.  We treat each of
    these elements of her submission in turn below.


International humanitarian law

21. Miss Webber  invoked  the  law  of  war  (or  of  armed  conflict),  or
    international humanitarian law as it has become known.  She argued that
    the appellant was entitled  to  disobey  the  order  to  lay  landmines
    because it would offend customary international law and its  principles
    of military necessity, humanity, discrimination  (or  distinction)  and
    proportionality, as set out in the UK Ministry of Defence's The  Manual
    of the Law of Armed Conflict (2005), chapter  2.   In  particular,  she
    argued, these principles would prohibit the use  of  landmines  against
    civilian targets.  She  referred  us,  in  particular,  to  the  Ottawa
    Convention on the Prohibition  of the Use, Stockpiling, Production  and
    Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction  (1997);  The
    Conventional Weapons Convention 1980, Protocol II  on  Prohibitions  or
    Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices  (1998)
    and common Article 3 of the 1949 Geneva Conventions.

22. We can deal with this aspect of the case briefly.  Iran is, of  course,
    not a party to the Ottawa Convention or Protocol  II.   Even  if  their
    provisions, like those  of  the  Geneva  Conventions,  formed  part  of
    customary international law they would, with the possible exception  of
    the Ottawa Convention, form part  of  international  humanitarian  law.
    (We deal later with the relevance of  these  Conventions  to  customary
    international law in times of peace.)  International  humanitarian  law
    is a species of international law applicable only in times  of  war  or
    where there exists a  situation  of  international  or  internal  armed
    conflict (see, Prosecutor v Tadic, Appeal on Jurisdiction, ICTY, No. IT-
    94-1-AR-72 (Oct 2 1995)).  It has no application in peacetime.  That is
    no doubt why Miss Webber found its general principles  so  conveniently
    summarised in The Manual of the Law of Armed Conflict.  As  we  pointed
    out earlier,  the  Immigration  Appeal  Tribunal  determined  that  the
    appellant was not engaged in an  armed  conflict  and  the  appeal  was
    remitted to us by the Court of Appeal specifically on that basis.

23. Thus, Miss Webber's reliance upon international humanitarian  law  must
    fail.

The a fortiori argument

24. If it be taken that international humanitarian law as such applies only
    in situations of armed conflict, Miss Webber then adopts an a  fortiori
    argument.  In her written skeleton argument she acknowledges that human
    rights  law  and  international   humanitarian   law   have   developed
    separately.  She continues as follows:

        "7.3      Initially,  humanitarian  law  was  applicable  only   to
             international   conflicts,   because   of   the   doctrine   of
             sovereignty, which was inimical to the  possible  intrusion  by
             other States into a State's  internal  affairs.   However,  the
             speedy development  of  human  rights  doctrines,  particularly
             during and after the Second World  War,  has  resulted  in  the
             State-sovereignty   oriented   approached    being    gradually
             supplanted by a human-being orientated approach (see Prosecutor
             v Tadic (jurisdiction), ICTY, decision 2 October 1995, paras 96-
             7).  This has meant (a) the  application  of  the  humanitarian
             norms developed in the context  of  international  conflict  to
             domestic conflict (ibid.); (b) the application in all States of
             certain principles in human rights law as peremptory norms,  in
             all circumstances, regardless of the context, such as the right
             not to be arbitrarily deprived of life,  the  right  to  bodily
             integrity and the right  to  be  free  from  cruel  or  inhuman
             treatment.


        7.4      Most Conventions which provide for the protection of human
             rights (a) include a far wider variety  of  rights  than  those
             applying during armed conflict, and (b) modify the  application
             of such rights (save for those which are absolute in nature, as
             are the two cited above) in time of war and armed conflict (see
             Krotov v SSHD [2004 EWCA Civ 69, [2004]  INLR  204,  para  38).
             Thus, in time of peace, civilians  are  protected  by  a  wider
             range of rights than during armed conflict, but all the  rights
             applicable in armed conflict can be assumed to be applicable in
             peacetime as aspects of fundamental human rights: see The Corfu
             Channel case,  Merits,  ICJ  Reports  1949  (p  22);  Barcelona
             Traction Light and Power Company, Judgment of 5 February  1970,
             ICJ Reports 1970,  para  33-4;  Case  Concerning  Military  and
             Paramilitary Activities In and Against Nicaragua, 1986  ICJ  14
             (Merits Judgment, June 27), (1986) at paras 215, 218.


        7.5      Thus the use of an indiscriminate weapon  in  a  situation
             where a civilian population is likely to be affected (by  death
             or severe injury), if prohibited during armed conflict, is even
             more likely to be contrary to the basic rules of human  conduct
             in time of peace.


        7.6      The appellant submits that, given the real likelihood of a
             landmine sown in a civilian area  causing  arbitrary  death  or
             severe injury to a civilian, and in particular a child, to have
             obeyed the order would have resulted in  a  real  risk  of  his
             involvement in  violation  of  fundamental  human  rights.   He
             further submits that given the wider reach of the human  rights
             Convention in times of peace than in times of  armed  conflict,
             such violations do not need  to  be  characterised  as  'gross'
             before he is entitled to refuse and to receive  the  protection
             of the Refugee Convention for  desertion,  since  there  is  no
             conceivable military necessity for them, as there might  be  in
             wartime."

25. This a fortiori argument has a superficial attraction.  In a  sense  it
    seems obvious that because a  person's  rights  are  likely  to  suffer
    diminution or abridgement in times of war, his rights in peace will  be
    at least as extensive as in war.  Similarly, it might appear that those
    rights protected in time of war must be those  which  are  central  and
    basic (so that they survive even the most severe conflict); and  rights
    so central and basic must necessarily be protected  in  peacetime  too.
    Despite the superficial attraction, however, it seems to us  that  this
    argument has no sound legal basis.

26. So far as concerns the authorities cited, Miss Webber made  no  further
    or more detailed reference to  the  Barcelona  case.   Tadic  is  clear
    authority  for  the  extension  to  internal  conflicts  of  the  rules
    applicable to conflicts between sovereign States, but contains  nothing
    to suggest that the same principles apply generally in the  absence  of
    armed conflict.

27. Both the Corfu Channel case and (in the  passages  with  which  we  are
    primarily concerned here) the Nicaragua case concerned the planting  of
    mines at sea.  In the former case the mines were planted by Albania  in
    Albanian  waters  through  which  there  was,  by  the   operation   of
    international custom relating to straits connecting two  parts  of  the
    high seas, a right of  passage.   It  does  not  appear  to  have  been
    suggested that the mine-laying itself was illegal; but, as the  court's
    majority decision, dated 9 April 1949, indicates at p 22:

        "The obligations incumbent upon the Albanian authorities  consisted
        in notifying, for the benefit of shipping in general, the existence
        of a minefield in Albanian territorial waters and  in  warning  the
        approaching British warships of the imminent danger  to  which  the
        minefield exposed them.  Such obligations are  based,  not  on  the
        Hague Convention of 1907, No VIII, which is applicable in times  of
        war, but on certain general and well-recognised principles, namely:
        elementary considerations of humanity, even more exacting in  peace
        than in war; the principle of  maritime  communication;  and  every
        State's obligation not to allow knowingly its territory to be  used
        for acts contrary to the rights of other states."

28. In the Nicaragua case the  United  States  of  America  laid  mines  in
    Nicaraguan waters, preventing lawful passage to Nicaraguan ports.  Much
    of the judgment responds to claims by the United States that insofar as
    its  acts  were  acts  of  aggression  they  were   not   contrary   to
    international law because any customary international law on the  issue
    had been subsumed in treaties by the relevant provisions of  which  the
    United States was not bound as it was not a  party  to  them.   In  its
    judgment of 27 June 1986 the Court rejected that argument, holding that
    treaty norms and customary norms could exist side by side, and  that  a
    State might be bound by customary norms even if  there  were  identical
    norms in a treaty to which it had chosen not to  subscribe.   (We  deal
    further and more generally with this issue below.)   It  followed  that
    the mine laying in this case was itself unlawful, although 'the actions
    of the United States in and against  Nicaragua  fall  under  the  legal
    rules relating to  international  conflicts'  (paras  215,  219).   The
    United States however, by failing to give notice of the presence of the
    mines,

        "commits a breach of the principles of humanitarian law  underlying
        the specific provisions of  Convention  No  VIII  of  1907.   Those
        principles were expressed by the Court in the Corfu Channel case as
        follows:


             'certain  general  and  well-recognised   principles,   namely:
             elementary considerations of humanity, even  more  exacting  in
             peace than in war'."

29. From these authorities we  derive  the  following  principles.   First,
    there are some 'elementary considerations of humanity' that have  legal
    force  apart   from   Conventions   or   Treaties.    Secondly,   those
    considerations apply in peace as well as in  war.   Thirdly,  they  are
    'more exacting' in peace, although the precise meaning of  that  phrase
    is far from clear.  Fourthly, they may be seen as  underlying  specific
    Convention provisions.  Fifthly, so far at any  rate  as  concerns  the
    specific issue addressed in these cases (and  we  have  been  shown  no
    other) they may relate to directing attention to the fact that  an  act
    has  been  done  (whether  lawfully  or  unlawfully)  rather  than   to
    prohibition of the act itself.  That, we apprehend, is because they are
    indeed principles of humanity rather than primary rules for the conduct
    of States' affairs whether in peace or war.

30. We do not find a transition from 'principles  of  humanity'  obligating
    States in their relations one with another to a  general  assertion  of
    human rights vested in individuals an easy one, and we do not see it in
    these authorities, or in Tadic (where the  admissibility  judgment  was
    given on 2 October 1995), despite  the  development  of  principles  of
    human rights in  national  and  international  jurisdictions  over  the
    period spanned by these judgments.  More particularly, there is nothing
    at all here to suggest that the 'law of peace', if we may  so  describe
    it, includes all the protective provisions of the law of war.  There is
    not even any authority here for saying the law of war  -  international
    humanitarian law - itself is a source of the law applicable in times of
    peace.  What is said is rather that there  are  certain  considerations
    underlying  international  humanitarian  law  and  Treaties   governing
    conflicts,  which,  because  they  reflect  general  considerations  of
    humanity, must apply also in peacetime.  One such consideration  is  an
    obligation to warn about mines.  No other such consideration  has  been
    identified in the materials put to us.  The suggestion  that  there  is
    here authority for  a  duty  not  to  lay  mines  is  entirely  without
    foundation, as is the suggestion  that  the  content  of  international
    humanitarian law (rather than some considerations upon which  it  lies)
    is to be regarded as a source of the law of peace.

31. The superficial attraction of the a  fortiori  argument,  to  which  we
    referred at the beginning of this section, rests on a  misapprehension.
    'International law' is not a general universal law  governing  mankind.
    'International law' is the phrase  used  by  lawyers  to  describe  the
    system  of  rules,  derived  from  various  sources,  that  govern  the
    relations between States.  For that reason its content is, save in  the
    specific area of international human  rights  law,  which  we  consider
    further below,  largely  confined  to  such  matters;  and  it  is  not
    surprising if, with that exception, it is relatively silent so  far  as
    the rights of individuals (or the duties of States towards individuals)
    are concerned in time of peace.  It is in times of war that  one  State
    is most likely to have such dealings with the citizens of another State
    as to require regulation.  As Tadic shows, the principles of  the  laws
    of war  between  sovereign  States  are  applicable  also  to  internal
    conflicts.  That  movement  is  no  doubt  inspired  to  an  extent  by
    principles of protection, but there is no doubt also  an  international
    interest in such conflicts, for it is an unfortunate fact that wars may
    spread, and even if the conflict remains confined within the boundaries
    of one State, it may have effects in  the  international  community  by
    producing refugees or demanding sanctions.

32. In times of peace, while there may need to be some  regulation  of  the
    way States treat nationals of other  States  in  alien  territory,  and
    while States may bind  themselves  by  Treaty  to  any  number  of  new
    obligations, the relations between a State and its  own  nationals  are
    likely to escape the attention of  international  law  in  general.   A
    graphic illustration of this reality is provided by the Rome Statute of
    the  International  Criminal  Court,  Part  2,  headed   'Jurisdiction,
    Admissibility and Applicable Law'.  The Court's jurisdiction is in  Art
    5 specified as including '(a) the crime of genocide; (b) crimes against
    humanity; (c) war crimes; (d) the crime of aggression'.  'Genocide'  is
    defined in Art 6 as encompassing any of five specified  acts.   'Crimes
    against humanity' are defined as including any of eleven specified acts
    (which are the subject of further definition) 'when committed  as  part
    of a widespread or systematic  attack  directed  against  any  civilian
    population, with knowledge of the attack'.  'War crimes' is the subject
    of a much more extensive definition.  The Court is to have jurisdiction
    over all such acts in particular (ie not exclusively) when committed as
    part of a plan or policy or as part of a large-scale commission of such
    crimes.  The crimes themselves are then listed.   There  are  fifty  in
    all, listed under four separate heads  (Art  8.2(a)(i)-(viii);  (b)(i)-
    (xxvi); (c)(i)-(iv); (e)(i)-(xii).  It is  abundantly  clear  that  the
    content of international humanitarian  law  -  the  law  of  war  -  is
    substantially more detailed than international law as it applies in the
    absence of conflict, and for the good reason we have set out above.

33. Thus, the a fortiori argument also fails.

The argument based on Article 1F

34. Article 1F of the Refugee Convention is as follows:

        "The provisions of this Convention shall not apply  to  any  person
        with respect to whom there  are  serious  reasons  for  considering
        that:
              a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime,  or  a
                 crime against humanity, as  defined  in  the  international
                 instruments drawn up to make provision in respect  of  such
                 crimes;
              b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside  the
                 country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as
                 a refugee;
              c) he has been guilty of acts contrary  to  the  purposes  and
                 principles of the United Nations."

35. It may not at first sight be clear why this Article, which is evidently
    exclusionary in character, could be the  subject  of  reliance  by  the
    appellant in the present case.  The clue is the context.   The  Refugee
    Convention generally provides international protection to those at risk
    of persecution for any of the 'Convention  reasons'.   Those  who  fall
    within the terms of Art 1F are, however,  excluded  as  undeserving  of
    such  protection,  despite  any  risk  of  their  persecution.   It  is
    therefore reasonable to suppose that the  international  community,  in
    assessing refugee claims, considers the acts mentioned  in  Art  1F  to
    have a particular character.  If they are the acts  that  are  of  such
    severity as to disqualify a claimant from  refugee  status,  they  must
    also be regarded as the acts  which  no  person  ought  to  commit  and
    therefore must be acts which nobody can properly be ordered to  commit.
    In Krotov, Potter LJ referred to this reasoning at [39]:

        "It can well be argued that just as an applicant for asylum will be
        accorded refugee status if he has committed international crimes as
        defined in (a), so he should not be denied refugee  status  if  his
        return to his home country would give him no choice other  than  to
        participate  in  the  commission  of  such  international   crimes,
        contrary to his genuine convictions and true conscience."

36. He went on to refer to paragraph 10 of the EU 1966  Joint  Position  of
    Council:

        "... refugee status may be granted, in the light of all  the  other
        requirements  of  the  definition,  in  cases  of   punishment   of
        conscientious objection or deliberate  absence  without  leave  and
        desertion on grounds  of  conscience  if  the  performance  of  his
        military duties were to have  the  effect  of  leading  the  person
        concerned to  participate  in  acts  falling  under  the  exclusion
        clauses in Article 1F of the Geneva Convention."

37. We should also mention Council Directive 2004/83/EC (the 'Qualification
    Directive'), which, is based on the Refugee Convention and has  binding
    force in all EU countries apart from Denmark from 10 October 2006.   In
    Art 9(2) it defines 'Acts of Persecution' as including

        "(e)     prosecution or punishment for refusal to perform  military
             service in a conflict, where performing military service  would
             include crimes or acts falling under the exclusion  clauses  as
             set out in Article 12(2)"

    which exclusion clauses are to all intents and purposes identical  with
    those in Art 1F of the Refugee Convention.

38. The role of Article 1F in setting out some principles of  inclusion  is
    in our view established.  Although its effect is confined by Potter  LJ
    on the facts of Krotov to acts within paragraph (a), and is confined by
    the Qualification Directive to acts in a conflict, Article 1F  is  seen
    by the international community as a yardstick for the identification of
    acts that a person has a good reason for refusing to perform.  For  the
    purposes of assessing Miss Webber's argument under  this  head  we  are
    prepared to take the view of the EU joint position, which is the widest
    view.  According  to  this,  punishment  for  failure  to  perform  any
    proscribed act within the compass of the whole of Art  1F,  whether  or
    not in a conflict, would be persecution.

39. So far as concerns Art 1F(a), Miss Webber seeks to show  that  the  act
    which the appellant was commanded  to  perform  was  'a  crime  against
    peace, a war crime or a  crime  against  humanity  as  defined  in  the
    international instruments drawn up to make provision for  such  crimes'
    by reference to Art 7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
    Court, and Art 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal.
     We have no doubt that these are instruments of the character described
    in Art 1F(a).

40. In the Rome Statute, Miss Webber points to the  definition  of  'crimes
    against humanity' as including '(a) murder; ... (k) other inhumane acts
    of a similar character intentionally causing serious injury to body  or
    to mental or physical health'.  She argues that the laying of landmines
    amounts to an act within one of  those  categories.   The  problem  is,
    however, that the Rome Statute definition is subject to  the  following
    overriding restriction:

        "when committed as part of a widespread  or  systematic  attack  or
        directed against any civilian population,  with  knowledge  of  the
        attack;"

      and 'attack directed  against  any  civilian  population'  is  further
defined as meaning:

        "a course of conduct involving  the  multiple  commission  of  acts
        [classed  as  crimes  against  humanity]   against   any   civilian
        population,  pursuant  to  or  in  furtherance  of   a   State   or
        organisational policy to commit such attack."

41. This part of Miss Webber's argument is doomed to failure on the  facts,
    for essentially the same reasons as we gave in respect of the  argument
    that the order involved the commission of an atrocity or a gross breach
    of human rights.  There is no evidential foundation for a finding  that
    the order in this case was to do an act that fell within the definition
    of a 'crime against humanity' in the Rome Statute.

42. The Charter of the International Military  Tribunal  (under  which  the
    Nuremberg trials were held) defines at Art 6 the  following  as  crimes
    within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:

        "(b)     Crimes: namely, violations of the laws or customs of  war.
             Such violations shall include, but not be limited  to,  murder,
             ill-treatment ... of civilian  population  of  or  in  occupied
             territory, murder or ill-treatment of  prisoners  of  war  ...,
             wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages, or devastation
             not justified by military necessity;


        (c)      Crimes against Humanity:  namely,  murder,  extermination,
             enslavement, deportation  and  other  inhumane  acts  committed
             against any civilian population, before or during the  war;  or
             persecutions on  political,  racial  or  religious  grounds  in
             execution of  or  in  connection  with  any  crime  within  the
             jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not  in  violation  of
             the domestic law of the country where perpetrated."

43. There is in our view no doubt both from the wording  of  these  clauses
    and their context that they refer only to acts committed in a  conflict
    or (in the case of (c)) before a conflict that  actually  takes  place.
    Indeed in R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate and others
    ex parte Pinochet Ugarete (No 3) [2001] 1 AC 147 at 272G, Lord  Millett
    observed as follows in the course of a discussion of the extent of  the
    prohibition  against   crimes   against   humanity   within   customary
    international law:

        "The Nuremberg Tribunal ruled that  crimes  against  humanity  fell
        within  its  jurisdiction  only  if  they  were  committed  in  the
        execution of or in connection with war  crimes  or  crimes  against
        peace.  But this appears to have been a jurisdictional  restriction
        based on the language of  the  Charter.   There  is  no  reason  to
        suppose that it was considered to be a substantive  requirement  of
        international law."  (emphasis added)

44. Because of the terms of Art 1F(a), we are concerned at  this  point  of
    the argument not with the substantive requirements of international law
    but with the language of  the  Charter  as  one  of  the  international
    instruments to which Art 1F(a) makes reference.  The act ordered in the
    present case, unconnected with any conflict, could not fall within  the
    definition in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal.

45. So far as concerns Art 1F(b), Miss Webber relies on the (UK)  Landmines
    Act 1998, submitting in her written skeleton as follows:

        "The Landmines Act 1998 makes it a criminal offence under UK law to
        lay landmines, and  gives  UK  courts  jurisdiction  over  offences
        committed abroad.   Such a sentence passed on a refugee already  in
        the UK results in a presumption of a  particularly  serious  crime,
        constituting the refugee a danger to the community for the purposes
        of refoulement, by virtue of  s  72  Nationality,  Immigration  and
        Asylum Act 2002.  The level of  sentence  reflects  the  degree  of
        gravity with which the act of planting landmines is seen, and shows
        that it is seen by the UK legislature as  being  an  act  which  is
        contrary to the basic rules of human conduct."

46. The final phrase is considered in some detail below.  We  should  point
    out that fourteen years is the maximum, not the automatic sentence; and
    that s72 is  confined  to  the  interpretation  of  Art  33(2)  of  the
    Convention and cannot assist in interpreting Art 1F.   Further,  as  Mr
    Eicke submitted,  the  provisions  of  the  Act  are  modelled  on  the
    provisions and extent of the Convention on the Prohibition of the  Use,
    Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of  Anti-Personnel  Mines  and  on
    their Destruction  (the  Ottawa  Convention)  in  that  insofar  as  it
    concerns activities abroad it prohibits acts only by  British  citizens
    and certain British juridical persons.  In s 5 of the Act there  is  an
    exemption for acts in the course of or for the purposes of  a  military
    operation outside the United Kingdom that involves the participation of
    British soldiers and those of some other State.   It  is  not  easy  to
    envisage circumstances in which, as Miss Webber  suggests,  'a  British
    citizen laying landmines with the appellant in Iran would be liable  to
    imprisonment for fourteen years'.  But this, with respect, is  not  the
    point.  We are concerned with the construction of Art 1F(b).   If  this
    appellant had laid the mines he would not be excluded by that  Article,
    because he would have committed  no  criminal  offence  under  the  law
    applicable to him.  The operation of the  same  interpretation  to  the
    same Article compels the result that his refusal to lay the mines  does
    not lead to his inclusion by Art 1F(b).

47. So far as concerns Art 1F(c), Miss Webber's case is as follows:

        "The Preamble  and  Article  1  of  the  [United  Nations]  Charter
        demonstrate that among the principles and purposes of the UN is the
        preservation of peace, and the  need  to  save  humanity  from  the
        scourge of war and its untold sorrow.  The development of  a  legal
        framework  for  disarmament,  the  development   of   international
        humanitarian law regulating the  deployment  of  weapons,  and  the
        development of international human rights law in  which  the  life,
        dignity and bodily integrity of  the  human  person  are  paramount
        values,  are  all  fundamental  to  the  work  of  the   UN.    The
        Conventions, Declarations and Resolutions  referred  to  above  [ie
        those relating to landmines] make  it  abundantly  clear  that  the
        deployment of indiscriminate and  inhumane  weapons  of  war  which
        cause untold suffering to civilians is contrary to the purposes and
        principles of the UN."

48. With respect, this argument seems to us to be stronger in rhetoric than
    in sound legal principle.  The United  Nations  Charter  is  a  Charter
    between States and in principle regulates the relations between States.
     Acts 'contrary to the purposes and principles of the  United  Nations'
    are likely for the most part to be committed by those who have control,
    de jure or de facto, of the organs of a State or in some other way  can
    control its policy.  Indeed, the tentative view expressed in the  UNHCR
    Handbook (at para 162, emphasis added) is that

        "an individual, in order to have committed an act contrary to these
        principles, must have been in a position of power in a member State
        and instrumental to his State's infringing these principles."

49. That view has, so far at least as this jurisdiction is concerned, given
    way to a view that acts of international terrorism clearly fall  within
    Art 1F(c) despite being committed by individuals who have no  authority
    within a State (KK [2004] UKIAT 00101; [2004] Imm AR 284; see now  also
    s 54 of the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum Act 2006): but it is in
    our view inconceivable that an ordinary  soldier  carrying  out  orders
    could  be  seen  as  having  such  individual  responsibility  for  the
    maintenance of international peace that he  could  be  penalised  under
    this head.  For such a person, only  paragraph  (a)  or  (b)  would  be
    appropriate as an exclusionary provision; and, similarly, such a person
    cannot rely on paragraph (c) to justify his refusal to obey orders.

50. Thus, even if the principle that in certain circumstances Art 1F can be
    a guide to inclusion within the Refugee  Convention  is  taken  at  its
    widest, it does not assist the appellant on the facts of this appeal.

Customary international law

51. Under the heading 'Customary international law' Miss Webber's  skeleton
    asserts as follows:

        "The appellant's contention is that he is not required to show that
        the landmine ban has achieved the status of a  peremptory  norm  of
        international law in order to  justify  his  refusal  to  lay  land
        mines, provided he can show -  as  he  can  -  that  the  level  of
        abhorrence and condemnation of the use of landmines, even among non-
        States Parties to the Ottawa Convention, is such that the  landmine
        ban has been recognised with record speed as at least  an  emerging
        norm of international law."

52. The appellant seems here to be making two submissions.   The  first  is
    that there is a rule of customary  international  law  prohibiting  the
    deployment of landmines in such circumstances as  those  in  which  the
    appellant received his order.  The second is that if  there  is  not  a
    rule of customary international law there is an 'emerging norm',  which
    has in this case the same effect as an actual rule of law.

53. Nothing in Miss Webber's skeleton or submissions, or in  anything  else
    we were  shown,  supports  the  second  submission.   The  very  phrase
    'emerging norm' demonstrates the difference between an established rule
    and the concept upon which Miss Webber would allow individuals to rely.
     It is, in more traditional language, lex ferenda as distinct from  lex
    lata.   There  is  simply  no  authority  to  suggest  that  States  or
    individuals are bound by concepts or practices  that  have  not  become
    law, whether or not they may do so in the future,  or  may  be  in  the
    process of becoming law.  The description of  the  'landmine  ban',  as
    Miss Webber calls it, as an 'emerging norm', together with the evidence
    that it has been 'recognised with record speed', are matters that in so
    far as they are relevant to  this  appeal  at  all  go  solely  to  the
    question of whether a rule against deploying  anti-personnel  landmines
    in times of peace is at present a peremptory norm of international law.
     If it is not, it need not be followed save by States that are  parties
    to the Treaties concerned.  If that is so, the fact that  those  States
    are numerous, the  fact  that  those  States  collected  together  very
    quickly in their subscription to  the  Treaties,  the  fact  that  this
    country is itself bound as a State Party,  and  the  fact  that  right-
    thinking people might well agree with the endeavours of  the  Treaties,
    are alike irrelevant in establishing obligations of States that are not
    parties.

54. We must therefore consider whether a ban on  the  deployment  of  anti-
    personnel landmines in peacetime is a part of  customary  international
    law.  So far as concerns the relation of  Conventions  or  Treaties  to
    rules of customary international  law,  the  following  principles  are
    clear.  First, a rule of customary international law may  arise  or  be
    established without  the  need  for  or  intervention  of  any  Treaty,
    provided that the practice of States  is  established,  widespread  and
    consistent and accompanied by the  'evidence  of  a  belief  that  this
    practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of  a  rule  requiring
    it'.  (This definition of opinio juris we owe to the  judgment  of  the
    International Court of Justice  in  the  North  Sea  Continental  Shelf
    cases, ICJ Reports 1969, para 77.)  Secondly, where a Treaty covers the
    same ground as a rule of  customary  international  law,  it  does  not
    follow that the customary norm has ceased to have effect as such: so  a
    State that derogates  from  the  Treaty  may  still  be  bound  by  the
    customary norm: Nicaragua case judgment, paras  174-182.    Thirdly,  a
    norm of customary international law may have a Treaty  as  its  origin.
    The judgment in the North Sea Continental  Shelf  cases  explores  this
    possibility, indicating at para 71,  in  a  passage  included  in  Miss
    Webber's written skeleton, that a Treaty may have

        "generated a rule which, while only conventional or contractual  in
        its  origin,  has  since  passed  into  the   general   corpus   of
        international law, and is now accepted as such by the opinio juris,
        so as to have become binding even for countries which  have  never,
        and do not, become parties to the Convention."

55. Miss Webber goes on to submit  that  'factors  indicating  that  Treaty
    provisions have become norms of customary international law include (a)
    very widespread and representative participation in a  Convention;  (b)
    whether the  Convention  admits  of  reservations;  (c)  extensive  and
    virtually uniform State practice, occurring in such a way  as  to  show
    general recognition that a rule of law  is  involved'.   This,  in  our
    view, is not an accurate way of expressing  the  minimum  requirements.
    The opinio juris  is  necessary  in  all  cases.   Mere  uniformity  of
    practice or near-universality of  ratification  of  the  Treaty  cannot
    suffice.  To cite again from the same judgment, at para 74:

        "Although the passage of  only  a  short  period  of  time  is  not
        necessarily, or itself, a bar to the formation of  a  new  rule  of
        customary international law on the basis of what was  originally  a
        purely conventional rule, an  indispensable  requirement  would  be
        that within that period of time, short though it  might  be,  State
        practice, including that of States whose interests are specifically
        affected, should have been both extensive and virtually uniform  in
        the sense of the provision invoked;  -  and  should  moreover  have
        concurred in such a way as to show a  general  recognition  that  a
        rule of law or legal obligation is involved."

56. There are other requirements, some  of  which  we  explore  below.   In
    particular, if the Treaty is said to be the source of  the  norm,  then
    the norm as expressed in the Treaty must be of the sort that  could  be
    regarded as amounting to a general rule of law. This is the reason  why
    the question whether the Treaty admits of reservations is relevant; but
    that is only one  of  the  relevant  questions  going  to  this  issue.
    Caution is always necessary: as para 71 of the  North  Sea  Continental
    Shelf cases judgment continues after the passage cited by Miss Webber:

        "There is no doubt that this process is a  perfectly  possible  one
        and does from time to time occur: it constitutes indeed one of  the
        recognised ways by which new rules of customary  international  law
        may be formed.  At the same time this result is not lightly  to  be
        regarded as having been attained."

57. We do not understand the appellant's case to be based on any suggestion
    that there is a customary rule  of  international  law  preventing  the
    laying of landmines in times of peace other than  one  derived  from  a
    Convention.  It is true that certain aspects of the  use  of  landmines
    offend against certain of the laws of war: for example  the  principles
    of  proportionality  and  distinction,  which,   as   well   as   being
    incorporated in Articles 51 and 57, and 48 (respectively) of Additional
    Protocol I (1977) to the  Geneva  Conventions  of  1949,  are  part  of
    customary international law applicable in situations of armed conflict.
     Those rules do not, however, apply in the absence  of  armed  conflict
    and nothing else before us is sufficient to establish  a  rule  in  the
    sense evoked by the appellant that predates or is  independent  of  the
    Treaties to which we were referred.

58. The Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the  Use  of  Certain
    Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or
    to Have Indiscriminate Effects of 1980, together with its  Protocol  II
    (1996) on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps
    and Other Devices are confined in their effect to situations  of  armed
    conflict: see Article 1 and the third Recital to  the  Convention,  and
    the second and third paragraphs of Article 1 of  the  Protocol.   If  a
    rule of customary international law  on  the  deployment  of  landmines
    other than in situations of armed conflict has emerged, its source must
    be the Ottawa Convention of 1997, paragraph 1 of  Article  1  of  which
    consists  of  undertakings  by  each  State  Party  'never  under   any
    circumstances' to use anti-personnel mines or to develop, acquire, keep
    or transfer them or to assist anyone  else  (whether  or  not  a  State
    Party) to do so.

59. Miss Webber relies on the fact that  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  a
    considerable number of  States  had  ratified  the  Ottawa  Convention,
    amounting in all to about three-quarters of the members of  the  United
    Nations.  In addition she cites General Assembly Resolutions and  a  UN
    Press Briefing as indications of general abhorrence of the damage  done
    by anti-personnel landmines.  In our judgment the material advanced  on
    the appellant's behalf is not sufficient to show that the norms of  the
    Ottawa Convention have become norms of customary international law, for
    the following reasons.

60. First, looked absolutely simply in terms of numbers, we do not consider
    that ratification of a Treaty by three-quarters of the countries in the
    world is evidence of acceptance of a new norm derived from the  Treaty.
    We accept that such a number might perhaps be sufficient if there  were
    other  potential sources of the norm - for example another  Treaty,  to
    which other States were party - but that is not the case here.

61. Secondly, the identification of  States  that  have  not  ratified  the
    Ottawa Convention is of considerable  interest.   They  include  (apart
    from Iran) the USA, China, India,  Pakistan,  the  Russian  Federation,
    North and South Korea, Poland, Bahrain, Morocco,  Indonesia,  Singapore
    and Finland.  There are here large countries and  smaller  ones;  there
    are three (more than half) of the permanent members of the UN  Security
    Council as well as Indonesia, which is  an  elected  member  for  2007;
    there are countries whose history, governance and present policy varies
    widely.  It is simply not possible to say that the States that have not
    ratified the Convention  are  to  be  together  regarded  as  resisting
    acceptance of an existing norm.  On the contrary: if the States Parties
    to the Ottawa Convention are seen as representative of  the  States  of
    the World, the States not party to the Convention are in many  ways  an
    equally representative group.

62. Thirdly, we see no reason to say that  it  is  those  States  that  are
    particularly affected by the  asserted  norm  that  have  ratified  the
    Convention.  If it were the case that all or nearly all of  the  States
    that historically have produced, traded in or  deployed  landmines  had
    ratified the Convention, it might not perhaps  matter  very  much  that
    other States had not done so.  But the position is  that  whereas  some
    affected  States  (such  as  the  United  Kingdom)  have  ratified  the
    Convention, others have not done so; and amongst smaller  countries  we
    may not be unduly cynical in perceiving an unwillingness to ratify  the
    Convention if a neighbouring superpower has not done  so.   If  we  are
    right about that, the suggestion is that these smaller States reserve a
    right to use landmines if they consider it necessary to  do  so,  which
    would be another factor counting against the existence  of  a  rule  of
    customary international law.

63. Fourthly, despite the general statements from various sources cited  by
    Miss Webber for the appellant, we do not  detect  an  opinio  juris  in
    support of the asserted norm.  States Parties  and  some  International
    organisations urge those States that have not ratified  the  Convention
    to do so, but the tone is one of  exhortation,  based  on  humanitarian
    arguments, not of a statement of legal principle said  to  compel  non-
    Parties to observe the norm even if they do not ratify the  Convention.
    We are not aware of any assertion that the provisions of Article  1  of
    the Convention have the force of customary international law  save  the
    single UN Press Briefing to which Miss Webber drew our attention. It is
    dated 1 October 1998  and  states  that  the  Ottawa  Convention  is  a
    'Convention of conscience, that acquired force of binding international
    law with historic speed'.  No doubt there may be more such  statements,
    but we are  confident  that  it  is  not  a  view  held  by  States  or
    international lawyers in general or even by the United Nations  itself,
    whose own  legislative  body,  the  Security  Council,  would  be  very
    unlikely, because of its composition, to be able to assent to the terms
    of this briefing. Annual  resolutions  of  the  General  Assembly  seek
    further ratifications of the Convention, rather  than  recognitions  of
    the Convention's norms as binding customary rules; and  expressions  of
    deep concern and regret over the use of  landmines  do  not  amount  to
    recognition that there is a  binding  international  law  rule  against
    them.

64. Fifthly, the fact that  the  Resolutions  to  which  Miss  Webber  made
    reference are typically  carried  nem  con  is  not  as  she  suggested
    explicable only on the ground that there is general recognition of  the
    existence of a binding norm.  The combination of the  resolutions  with
    the fact that by no means all of those voting in favour  have  ratified
    the Convention has another obvious explanation.  It is that  States  in
    general  seek  the  time  when  all  States  will  have  mutually   and
    reciprocally abandoned the use of  landmines,  many  States  seeing  no
    obligation to do so without the  protection  offered  by  other  States
    doing the same.  This, as  we  have  hinted  above,  may  well  be  the
    specific reason for  non-ratification  by  certain  States.   But  this
    explanation for the widespread exhortation to the Treaty  coupled  with
    less than universal ratification of  it  has  a  wider  impact  in  the
    context of the arguments put to us.  It is an approach to  the  banning
    of landmines that  is  essentially  contractual  or  conventional;  the
    obligation of one State depending therefore not on  a  peremptory  norm
    but on the obligations accepted by other States.  We do  not  rule  out
    the possibility that if  the  desired  universal  ratification  of  the
    Convention were achieved (or nearly achieved) it might be  possible  to
    move on thence to arguments for the development of  a  customary  rule;
    but in the present period the acts and assertions of States are on this
    view referable to issues of contract rather than issues of  supervening
    obligation.

65. Sixthly, although we should not be inclined to allow  our  judgment  to
    depend on this point alone, we have some doubt whether the terms of the
    Convention  itself,  taken  as  a  whole,  can  be  regarded  as  of  a
    fundamentally norm-creating character.  It is true that Article 1 is in
    the most universal terms; but Article  13  permits  amendments  to  the
    Convention  (including  Article  1)  and  envisages  the  presence,  at
    meetings considering  such  amendments,  of  non-State  Parties.   Such
    provisions are by no means unusual, but they do not help to  show  that
    the norms set out in Article 1 are indeed universal and  peremptory  in
    the terms there used, and that in those terms  they  bind  all  States.
    Further,  Article  18  of   the   Convention,   entitled   'Provisional
    application' is as follows:

        "Any State  may  at  the  time  of  its  ratification,  acceptance,
        approval or accession, declare that  it  will  apply  provisionally
        paragraph 1 of Article 1 of this Convention pending its entry  into
        force."

66. That provision was part of the Convention from its origin  and  it  may
    not be surprising that it has not been deleted: but  if  Miss  Webber's
    argument is right it can now be of no  effect  at  all,  because  every
    State that is not already a Party is bound by the norms of paragraph  1
    of Article 1 independently of  ratification,  acceptance,  approval  or
    accession.  Again this point is no doubt of lesser force, but it is not
    easy to see that  a  Convention  including  a  provisional  application
    clause can be seen as embodying a peremptory  norm  covering  the  same
    ground as that clause.

67. As we noted above, the International Court of Justice  at  the  end  of
    para 71 in the North Sea Continental Shelf cases judgment warns against
    lightly regarding a conventional rule as having attained the status  of
    a peremptory norm.  Here the number and nature  and  interests  of  the
    States that are not parties to the Convention,  the  apparent  lack  of
    supporting opinio juris, the existence of  an  alternative  explanation
    for the posture of States in respect of the Convention, and  the  terms
    of the Convention itself, all point away from that conclusion.

68. The argument that a ban on landmines in peacetime has become a  binding
    rule of customary international law therefore also fails.

The 'basic rules of human conduct generally recognised by the  international
community'.

69. It will be recalled that the Order of the  Court  of  Appeal  remitting
    this matter to  the  Tribunal  specifically  required  us  to  identify
    whether there are any and if so what  'basic  rules  of  human  conduct
    generally recognised by the international community' in times of peace,
    and also to identify whether the 'basic rules of  human  conduct'  that
    are identified in Krotov  as  applicable  in  times  of  war  are  also
    applicable in times of peace.  It will also be recognised that  we  may
    appear to have moved rather slowly towards  an  attempt  to  deal  with
    those issues.  The reason for the delay is partly  that  we  needed  to
    respond to the appellant's case in the way put by Miss Webber;  but  it
    is partly also that the concept of a group of  'basic  rules  of  human
    conduct' that have legal force other than in times  of  armed  conflict
    appears to be a novel one save insofar as it is either to be limited to
    the proscription of 'atrocities or gross human rights abuses' or to  be
    based on  Conventions having force as such.   The  preceding  parts  of
    this determination have been devoted to considering whether there could
    be any other basis for the identification of these basic rules in a way
    which would assist the appellant in this case.  We have concluded  that
    there is not.  Further, it is far from clear that any authority binding
    on us points to the existence of such a corpus of  rules.   The  phrase
    'the basic rules of human conduct' appears to be derived in Krotov from
    para 171 of the UNHCR Handbook  (see eg Potter LJ at [22]),  where  the
    context is clearly that of armed conflict.  The phrase is used again in
    that context by Potter LJ at [29] where he cites, to the  same  effect,
    Laws LJ in Sepet and Bulbul v SSHD  [2001] EWCA 681 and  an  unreported
    decision of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.

70. Krotov itself is a decision confined on  its  facts  to  situations  of
    armed conflict, and it is somewhat difficult to see that the paragraphs
    of the judgment of Potter LJ to which reference is made in the Court of
    Appeal's Order in the present case have any wider reference.  Paragraph
    [37] follows a discussion identifying a  number  of  rules  proscribing
    certain conduct in situations of armed conflict.  It is as follows:

        "In my view, the crimes listed above, if committed on a  systematic
        basis as an aspect of a  deliberate  policy,  or  as  a  result  of
        official  indifference  to  the  widespread  actions  of  a  brutal
        military, qualify as acts contrary to  the  basic  rules  of  human
        conduct in respect of which punishment for a refusal to participate
        will  constitute  persecution  within  the  ambit  of  the  Refugee
        Convention"

71. Paragraph [38] is cited in part in the Order, but we must set it out in
    full:

        "It is in my view preferable to refer in  this  context  to  'basic
        rules of human conduct' or  'humanitarian  norms'  rather  than  to
        'abuse of human rights', at least unless accompanied by the epithet
        'gross': cf the observations of Lord  Bingham  of  Cornhill  quoted
        above [sc Sepet and Bulbul [2003] UKHL 15 at [8]].  That is because
        human rights really concern rights enjoyed by  all  at  all  times,
        whereas humanitarian rules concern rights which protect individuals
        in armed conflicts.  Most Conventions  and  other  documents  which
        provide for the protection of human rights (a) include a far  wider
        variety of rights  than  the  rights  to  protection  from  murder,
        torture and  degradation  internationally  recognised  as  set  out
        above; (b) in any event contain safeguards which exclude or  modify
        the application of such rights in time of war and  armed  conflict:
        see generally the approach set out in Ingrid Detter, The Law of War
        (2nd edn, Cambridge University Press, 2000, at pp 160-163)."

72. What Potter  LJ  is  clearly  doing  here  is  distancing  the  general
    jurisprudence of human rights and its vocabulary from  'this  context',
    that is to say the law of armed conflict.  The part of para [38]  cited
    in the Order is,  we  apprehend,  not  intended  as  a  ground-breaking
    advance in the development of the international law of human rights but
    is merely a reason for asserting that the language  of  'human  rights'
    should not be used carelessly to denominate the 'crimes  listed  above'
    and the ills caused by their commission in times of armed conflict.  In
    any event, this paragraph refers as a source of any  international  law
    of human rights only to 'Conventions and other documents which  provide
    for the protection of human rights'.  It is  not  suggested  here  that
    there is a body of human rights law to be found outside such documents.



73.  Paragraph [51] is as follows:

        "As I have already indicated, while these objections [sc to various
        proposed points of interpretation] have force, they should  not  in
        my view prevail over the necessity for the courts,  in  seeking  to
        define and apply the working test in cases of this  kind,  to  have
        regard to the realities of the  particular  conflict  in  which  an
        applicant has refused to participate rather than  to  the  specific
        question of whether that  conflict  has  yet  been  internationally
        condemned.  If a court of tribunal is satisfied: (a) that the level
        and nature of the  conflict,  and  the  attitude  of  the  relevant
        governmental authority towards it, has  reached  a  position  where
        combatants are or may be required,  on  a  sufficiently  widespread
        basis to act  in  breach  of  the  basic  rules  of  human  conduct
        generally recognised by the international community; (b) that  they
        will be punished for refusing to do so; and (c) that disapproval of
        such methods and fear of such  punishment  is  the  genuine  reason
        motivating the refusal of an asylum-seeker to serve in the relevant
        conflict, then it should find that a  Convention  ground  has  been
        established."

74. The substance of  this  paragraph  is  clearly  concerned  solely  with
    situations of armed conflict.  Further, the phrase 'the basic rules  of
    human conduct generally recognised by the international  community'  is
    not merely being used here in this context: it is defined by Potter  LJ
    at [38]  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  use  in  the  context  of
    situations of armed conflict.  There  is  nothing  here  to  suggest  a
    general law of human rights in times of peace, and, crucially, there is
    nothing to suggest that there is any body of rules  called  'the  basic
    rules of  human  conduct  generally  recognised  by  the  international
    community' that has any normative effect save in  situations  of  armed
    conflict.

75. Miss Webber submitted that these and other remarks in Krotov should not
    be read as 'imposing a universal requirement of conflict in  order  for
    desertion to be justified as an objection to the basic rules  of  human
    conduct . ... The issue in all cases is whether the  acts  objected  to
    are repugnant, not whether they are performed in war or  peace'.    She
    gave as her reason 'otherwise, a serving soldier  who  was  ordered  to
    mutilate or torture a prisoner in his custody in  peacetime  could  not
    seek refugee status on desertion'.  We do not agree  with  the  reason.
    As we have discussed above, and as  is  generally  accepted,  a  person
    ordered to commit a serious non-political crime within the  meaning  of
    Article 1F of the Refugee Convention on  its  true  construction  would
    have a claim.  Further, a person ordered to commit  an  atrocity  or  a
    gross human rights abuse would  have  a  claim.   It  is  by  no  means
    apparent to us that the Court of Appeal in Krotov intended  to  go  any
    further than this; and we certainly consider that if they had  done  so
    they would have been making new law.

76. That conclusion is sufficient to deal  with  the  questions  which  the
    Order  identifies  as  not  having  previously  been  answered  by  the
    Tribunal.  The 'basic rules of human conduct  generally  recognised  by
    the international community' is  a  phrase  used  in  the  analysis  of
    certain aspects of the law of armed conflict.  The rules in question do
    not as such apply in times of peace, and there  is  no  body  of  rules
    known by that name that is to be derived from 'an analysis of  relevant
    international human rights norms' and is recognised in times of peace.

77. Further, we should with respect add that  (despite  the  words  of  the
    Order) the Court of Appeal's indication at para  [51]  of  what  courts
    should consider 'when assessing such claims' does  not  apply  to  this
    appeal.  It  applies  only  in  the  context  of  situations  of  armed
    conflict.

78. In the written skeletons of both parties the Refugee  Convention  issue
    is put as being whether:

        "being forced to plant landmines in civilian areas is  contrary  to
        the basic rules of human conduct and to be punished for refusing to
        engage in such conduct amounts to persecution".

79. In view of what we have said, the answer to that question  must  be  in
    the negative for the purposes of  this  appeal.   The  rules  to  which
    reference is made are rules that have no application  in  this  appeal.
    The argument based on 'the basic rules of human conduct' therefore also
    fails.

International human rights law

80. International human rights law is, as Potter LJ made clear  in  Krotov,
    different  from  the  law  of  war.   It  is  found  in   international
    Conventions and other documents.  Those documents  tend  to  offer  and
    protect a wider range of human rights than the rights protected in war;
    and they tend to have provisions  varying  or  abridging  some  of  the
    rights in times of war.

81. They have, as we read them, another feature, which is  common  to  many
    Conventions.  They are  made  between  States,  and  whereas  they  are
    clearly entered into for the  protection  of  the  human  beings  whose
    rights are the subject of them, the obligations are imposed on  States,
    not on individuals.  As we have seen, the law of war  imposes  negative
    obligations  on  individuals;  and,  in  addition,   there   are   some
    'elementary considerations of humanity' that may apply to  the  conduct
    of individuals.  Further, it may be possible to extrapolate, from  Lord
    Bingham's indication that a requirement to commit 'atrocities or  gross
    human rights abuses' could found a refugee claim on the ground that the
    punishment for refusal would be persecutory, a rule that the commission
    of such acts would be a  breach  of  international  human  rights  law,
    although it is difficult to see where the sanction would lie unless the
    act was also proscribed by some Treaty or Convention.

82. Miss Webber submits that the planting of landmines in peacetime  in  an
    area inhabited and  frequented  by  civilians  contravenes  'elementary
    considerations of humanity set out in Articles 6 and 7 of the ICCPR and
    is thus contrary to the basic rules of human conduct'.  We have already
    dealt with the last phrase and do not need to consider it further.   We
    have noted that international human rights law is to be  found  in  the
    relevant Conventions and other documents, and so we are  not  concerned
    with what are here called 'elementary considerations  of  humanity  set
    out in' the International Covenant on Civil  and  Political  Rights  of
    1966 (the ICCPR), to which Iran is a State  Party,  as  is  the  United
    Kingdom.  We are concerned instead  with  the  actual  content  of  the
    Convention.  Articles 6 and 7 are as follows:



        "Article 6
        1. Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right
        shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of
        his life.

        2. In countries which have not abolished the death penalty,
        sentence of death may be imposed only for the most serious crimes
        in accordance with the law in force at the time of the commission
        of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present
        Covenant and to the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of
        the Crime of Genocide. This penalty can only be carried out
        pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a competent court.
        3. When deprivation of life constitutes the crime of genocide, it
        is understood that nothing in this article shall authorize any
        State Party to the present Covenant to derogate in any way from any
        obligation assumed under the provisions of the Convention on the
        Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
        4. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or
        commutation of the sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the
        sentence of death may be granted in all cases.
        5. Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by
        persons below eighteen years of age and shall not be carried out on
        pregnant women.
        6. Nothing in this article shall be invoked to delay or to prevent
        the abolition of capital punishment by any State Party to the
        present Covenant.


        Article 7
        No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or
        degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be
        subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific
        experimentation."



83. The appellant's  case  under  this  head  is  as  follows.   Laying  of
    landmines is a breach of Article 6 or Article 7 or both.  Therefore the
    act that the appellant was ordered to perform was a breach of Article 6
    or Article 7 and was  accordingly  a  breach  of  the  ICCPR.   He  was
    accordingly not required to perform that act, and  any  punishment  for
    his refusal to do so will amount to persecution.

84. That argument poses numerous difficulties.  In the first place, we have
    the greatest difficulty in accepting the proposition that the laying of
    landmines, even in the circumstances identified by Miss Webber, that is
    to say in  peacetime  and  in  an  area  inhabited  and  frequented  by
    civilians, is itself capable of being a breach of these Articles of the
    Covenant.  Looking as we do in this Tribunal on a daily  basis  at  in-
    country  claims  based  on  the  similar  provisions  of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights, we are accustomed to evaluating a right  to
    resist expulsion from this country according to  the  calculus  of  the
    risk on return to another  country.   But  that  is  not  an  essential
    feature of the  law  contained  in  the  human  rights  Conventions  in
    general.  In general, a breach of human rights is not committed  merely
    by doing an act which might, under certain  circumstances,  breach  the
    human rights of an as yet unidentified individual.  While there  is  no
    victim, there is no breach.

85. Secondly, we have set out in paragraphs 6-11 of this determination  the
    accepted factual basis upon which we decide this  appeal.   Nothing  in
    the material before us goes to establish that the individual  act  that
    the appellant refused to commit was  in  fact  one  that  would  breach
    anybody's rights  as  protected  by  the  ICCPR.   It  is  not,  as  we
    understand it, suggested that he was to be responsible  for  laying  an
    entire minefield, and, even if he were, there is no assessment  of  the
    risk posed to others by that particular minefield.  The same  could  be
    said of an order to take part in general in a mine-laying party.  If by
    obeying the order the appellant had responsibility for all the acts  of
    his comrades, there would still be no evidence of  the  level  of  risk
    created by this particular sortie.  The effect of any particular act of
    mine-laying by the  appellant  would  depend  on  a  number  of  things
    including no doubt whether there were published warnings  and  notices,
    the  position  of  one  mine  in  relation  to  others,  the  level  of
    frequentation of the area, and the efficiency or otherwise of the mines
    themselves.

86. Thus, the position in our view is that  mine-laying  itself  cannot  be
    seen as a breach of  the  ICCPR  in  the  absence  of  actual  harm  to
    individuals; and that even if a breach of the ICCPR were to be seen  in
    the creation of a risk of a breach of Articles 6 or 7,   (which  we  do
    not think is the correct approach) the appellant fails to show that the
    actual act he refused to do would have created such a risk  if  he  had
    done it.

87. But there are, however, further  problems  for  the  appellant  in  his
    attempt to rely on the ICCPR.  The appellant's claim is  not  that  his
    human rights as protected by the ICCPR would have been breached by  his
    act.  He claims an incidental protection from the ICCPR  on  the  basis
    that he is entitled to refuse to breach the rights of others.  But this
    aspect of his claim raises a third difficulty.   The  ICCPR  places  no
    obligations on individuals.  The  obligations  are  undertaken  by  the
    States party to the Covenant.  The appellant could not be  the  subject
    of sanction in any action based  on  the  ICCPR.   He  is  in  a  quite
    different position from a person who is ordered  to  do  something  for
    which he would in international law bear personal  responsibility,  for
    example an act of genocide, or who is ordered to commit  an  act  which
    would for some other reason remove  him  from  the  protection  of  the
    Refugee Convention.  His own individual liability  under  international
    law is entirely unaffected by obeying the order.  His  country  may  be
    liable for a breach of the ICCPR: but he will not be.

88. The last consideration shows  that  this  element  of  the  appellant's
    argument amounts in truth to a  claim  to  base  his  own  attitude  to
    military discipline and the law  of  his  own  country  solely  on  his
    conscience.  He seeks exemption from the  order  not  because  he  will
    suffer any consequences as a result of obeying, but because  he  feels,
    with all honesty and conviction, that  he  should  not  obey  it.   The
    decision of the House of Lords in Sepet and Bulbul makes it  absolutely
    clear that conscientious objection to  military  service  does  not  of
    itself ground a refugee claim.; and the position can  be  no  different
    for other conscientious refusals to obey the law.

89. Thus Miss Webber's argument based on the ICCPR also fails.

Conclusion

90. We do not accept that  the  rules  of  international  law  relating  to
    situations of armed conflict can be translated readily  into  times  of
    peace.  In war there are good reasons for States to be  concerned  with
    the activities of other States, and  the  international  community,  is
    necessarily engaged; so detailed rules of war (or armed conflict)  have
    developed.  Armed conflicts within  a  single  State  are  conveniently
    governed by the same rules.  The stresses and motives of conflict  make
    it particularly important to regulate conduct so  that  it  should  not
    pass the boundaries of the humane conduct of war.  In peacetime many of
    these considerations are absent, and it has been a clear feature of the
    development of international law that the rules applicable to  war  are
    to be distinguished from those applicable to peace.

91.  It may well be that the number of acts for which an  individual  bears
    personal responsibility in international law will continue to increase;
    and we apprehend that individual responsibility  in  international  law
    may become an increasing feature of the law of peace as well as the law
    of war.  For the present and no doubt for the foreseeable future,  such
    changes will have to be brought about by Treaty.  In the mean  time  it
    is not in  general  open  to  an  individual  to  claim  the  surrogate
    protection of the international community in order to escape punishment
    for refusing to obey the law of  his  country  in  circumstances  where
    obedience would have no consequence in international law for  him.   He
    may be able to resist where his own human rights are infringed, and  he
    can resist if he is required to do something  for  which  he  would  be
    individually responsible in  international  law  or  which  would  have
    consequences for his  standing  in  international  law  if  he  claimed
    asylum.  But he is not entitled to base a claim on an attempt to  guard
    his country's conscience.  His own conscientious refusal  does  not  of
    itself found a claim, and  he  is  not  responsible,  save  as  already
    indicated, for the acts of his country.





92. It follows from the above that we reject  each  basis  upon  which  the
    appellant's asylum appeal was argued.   There  being  no  other  matter
    before us, we find that the Adjudicator made no material error  of  law
    and we order that his determination, dismissing the appellant's appeal,
    shall stand.
