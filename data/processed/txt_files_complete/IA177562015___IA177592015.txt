Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr N Aborisade (OA Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr P Singh (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. These are the appeals of Esther [B] and her daughter  [EB]  (born  in
       Nigeria, on [ ] 2008) against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
       of 27 September 2016 dismissing  their  appeals,  themselves  brought
       against the decisions of 16 April 2015 to refuse  their  applications
       for leave to remain on human rights grounds.


    2. On 9 January  2015  the  Appellants  applied  for  leave  to  remain,
       explaining that they lived in privately rented accommodation and were
       maintained from the proceeds of sales of  property  in  Nigeria.  The
       applications were provoked by the kidnapping of  their  relatives  in
       Nigeria, by the religious extremists of Boko Haram.


    3. The applications were refused on the basis that there  were  no  very
       significant obstacles to the mother's integration back  in  her  home
       country of Nigeria where she had long lived,  and  it  would  not  be
       contrary to the best interests of [EB], or unreasonable with  respect
       to [E],  for  the  children  to  relocate.  The  immigration  history
       provided in the refusal letter set out that Esther had entered the UK
       on multiple visit visas that had been valid for lengthy periods  from
       4 May 2004 onwards, most recently on one valid from 20 May 2011 to 20
       May 2016.


    4. An adjournment application was made on the Appellant's behalf  below,
       on the basis that Esther wished to make an asylum claim based on  her
       fears of Boko  Haram;  additionally  her  HIV  status  had  not  been
       considered by the Home Office. The  First-tier  Tribunal  refused  to
       adjourn proceedings, and the Presenting Officer  indicated  that  she
       would forego cross examination on the Boko  Haram  dimension  of  the
       case, noting that any health claim would have to face the high hurdle
       identified in N v United Kingdom 2008 47 EHRR 885.


    5. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that  the  father  of
       both daughters was [CO], from whom the Appellant is now separated. He
       became a British citizen, before the birth of their  second  daughter
       [E], who is now a British citizen. A rather vague letter from [CO] of
       May 2015 appeared to indicate that he played some part in their lives
       but the mother was their primary carer.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on the  basis  that  the
       evidence as to [CO]'s present circumstances was so vague as  to  cast
       doubt on the claim that he no longer provided care to  the  children.
       There was an inconsistency in her account of the abduction of  family
       members by Boko Haram: she had stated that all of her family had been
       taken, but also and that her mother  and  brother  had  fled  to  the
       mountains for safety.  Approaching  the  Boko  Haram  question  as  a
       disguised asylum  claim,  there  was  nothing  to  prevent  her  from
       relocating to another part of the country. She had shown  herself  to
       be resourceful and her HIV status had apparently  been  managed  over
       the decade she had visited the UK;  she  was  clearly  a  resourceful
       woman who had been involved in trading before coming to this country.
       It was not accepted that there were  problems  with  the  quality  of
       education in Nigeria, but even if that was true it would  not  render
       return disproportionate. The British citizen child was in fact a dual
       national and were it true that there was no contact from the  father,
       then  her  interests  would  point  in  favour  of  living  with  the
       Appellant.


    7. Grounds of appeal contended that the best interests of the child  had
       been given only the most  rudimentary  consideration,  inconsistently
       with MA Pakistan, and  without  regard  to  section  117B(6)  of  the
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  and  failed  to  have
       regard to the stated Home Office policy on the approach to the  cases
       of British citizen children.


    8. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 13 March 2017
       on the basis that the grounds showed arguable errors of law.


    9. Before me, Mr Singh pragmatically accepted that there was a  material
       error of law in the decision below, on the basis that a positive case
       had been put before the First-tier Tribunal that  the  Appellant  was
       the sole carer for both her children, including the  British  citizen
       child [E], and the First-tier Tribunal's rather equivocal  acceptance
       of that possibility demanded that the appeal be  evaluated  with  the
       Zambrano principle in mind.


      Findings and reasons


   10. Appendix FM provides:


           "Section R-LTRPT: Requirements for limited leave to remain as  a
           parent
           R-LTRPT.1.1. The requirements to be met  for  limited  leave  to
           remain as a parent are-
           (a) the applicant and the child must be in the UK;
           (b) the applicant must have made a valid application for limited
           or indefinite leave to remain as a parent or partner; and either
           (c)
                (i) the applicant must not fall for refusal under Section S-
                LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and
                (ii) the applicant meets all of the requirements of  Section
                ELTRPT: Eligibility for leave to remain as a parent, or
           (d)
                (i) the applicant must not fall  for  refusal  under  S-LTR:
                Suitability leave to remain; and
                (ii) the applicant meets the requirements of  paragraphs  E-
                LTRPT.2.2-2.4. and E-LTRPT.3.1-3.2; and
                (iii) paragraph EX.1. applies.
           Relationship requirements
           E-LTRPT.2.2. The child of the applicant must be-
                (a) under the age of 18 years at  the  date  of  application
                ...;
                (b) living in the UK; and
                (c) a British Citizen or settled in the UK; or
                (d) has lived in the UK continuously  for  at  least  the  7
                years immediately preceding  the  date  of  application  and
                paragraph EX.1. applies.
           E-LTRPT.2.3. Either-
                (a) the applicant must have sole parental responsibility for
                the child or the child normally lives with the applicant and
                not their other parent (who is a British Citizen or  settled
                in the UK), and the applicant must not be eligible to  apply
                for leave to remain as a partner under this Appendix; or
                (b) the parent or carer with whom the child  normally  lives
                must be-
                     (i) a British Citizen in the UK or settled in the UK;
                     (ii) not the partner  of  the  applicant  (which  here
                     includes a person who has been in a relationship  with
                     the applicant for less than two  years  prior  to  the
                     date of application); and
                     (iii) the applicant must not be eligible to apply  for
                     leave to remain as a partner under this Appendix.
            E-LTRPT.2.4.
                (a) The applicant  must  provide  evidence  that  they  have
                either-
                     (i) sole parental responsibility  for  the  child,  or
                     that the child normally lives with them; or
                     (ii) direct access (in person) to the child, as agreed
                     with the parent or carer with whom the child  normally
                     lives or as ordered by a court in the UK; and
                (b) The  applicant  must  provide  evidence  that  they  are
                taking, and intend to continue to take, an  active  role  in
                the child's upbringing.
           Section EX: Exceptions to certain eligibility  requirements  for
           leave to remain as a partner or parent
           EX.1. This paragraph applies if
                (a)
                (i) the applicant has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                relationship with a child who-
                 (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age  of
                 18 years when the applicant was first granted leave on  the
                 basis that this paragraph applied;
                 (bb) is in the UK;
                 (cc)  is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the   UK
                 continuously for at least the 7 years immediately preceding
                 the date of application; and
                (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
                the UK ..."


   11. The parent route operates thus:


   a) The possession of leave is not a prerequisite of this route where  the
      exception at Ex.1 is relied upon (E-LTRPT.3.2(b));


   b) There  are  various  relationship  requirements  which  must  each  be
      satisfied by an applicant:


    - they must be the parent of a child who  has  been  resident  here  for
      seven years if not a British citizen or settled here (E-LTRPT.2.2);


    - sole responsibility for a child is one of the gateways  to  satisfying
      the Rule (E-LTRPT.2.3);


    - they must show that they have sole  parental  responsibility  for  the
      child, or that the child normally lives with them (E-LTRPT.2.4).


   12. It would appear that those requirements are potentially met  in  this
       case, subject to evaluation of the Ex.1 element  of  the  Rules.  The
       Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides:


          "PART 5A
          Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations
          117A Application of this Part
          (1) This Part applies where a court or  tribunal  is  required  to
          determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-
           (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private and  family
           life under Article 8, and
           (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of  the  Human
           Rights Act 1998.
          (2) In considering the public  interest  question,  the  court  or
          tribunal must (in particular) have regard-
           (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in  section  117B
           ...
          117B  Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in  all
          cases
          ...
          (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,  the
          public interest does not require the person's removal where-
          (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
          with a qualifying child, and
          (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
          United Kingdom.
          117D Interpretation of this Part
          (1) In this Part- ...
          "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age of  18  and
          who-
          (a) is a British citizen, or
          (b) has lived in the United Kingdom for  a  continuous  period  of
          seven years or more;"


   13. Zambrano v Office National de l'Emploi (ONEm) [2011] All E R (EC) 491
       establishes that Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning  of  the
       European Union "is to be interpreted as meaning that it  precludes  a
       member state from refusing a third country national  upon  which  his
       minor children, who are European Union  citizens,  are  dependent,  a
       right of residence in the member state of residence  and  nationality
       of those children, and from refusing to grant a work permit  to  that
       third country national, in so far as  such  decisions  deprive  those
       children of the genuine enjoyment of  the  substance  of  the  rights
       attaching to the status of European Union citizen".


   14. That principle is  given  expression  in  The  Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2006


         "15A. Derivative right of residence
         (1) A person ("P")  who  is  not  [an  exempt  person]  2  and  who
         satisfies the criteria in paragraph (2), (3), (4) [, (4A)] 3 or (5)
         of this regulation is entitled to a derivative right to  reside  in
         the United  Kingdom  for  as  long  as  P  satisfies  the  relevant
         criteria. ...
         (4A) P satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
         (a) P is the primary carer of  a  British  citizen  ("the  relevant
         British citizen");
         (b) the relevant British citizen is residing in the United Kingdom;
         and
         (c) the relevant British citizen would be unable to reside  in  the
         UK or in another EEA State if P were required to leave.
         (7) P is to be regarded as a "primary carer" of another person if
         (a) P is a direct relative or a legal guardian of that person; and
         (b) P-
         (i) is the person who has primary responsibility for that  person's
         care;"


   15. Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11 �67 demonstrates  the  potential  relationship
       between the Zambrano principle and the considerations  identified  in
       the Immigration Rules, Lord Reed stating


           "In the event that a  situation  were  to  arise  in  which  the
           refusal of a third-country national's application for  leave  to
           remain in the UK would force his or her British partner to leave
           the EU, in breach of article 20 TFEU, such a situation could  be
           addressed  under   the   Rules   as   one   where   there   were
           "insurmountable  obstacles",  or  in   any   event   under   the
           Instructions   as   one   where    there    were    "exceptional
           circumstances". Typically, however, as in the present cases, the
           British citizen would not be forced to leave the  EU,  any  more
           than in the case of Dereci, and the third-country national would
           not, therefore, derive any rights from article 20."


   16. As recently stated by the Court of Justice of the European  Union  in
       Chavez-Vilchez [2017] EUECJ C-133/15, the fact that the other  parent
       is able and willing to  assume  sole  responsibility  for  a  child's
       primary care is a relevant factor but  not  a  sufficient  ground  to
       conclude that the child would not be compelled to follow  the  parent
       who present holds that responsibility:  the  best  interests  of  the
       child  must  be  assessed  having  regard   to   all   the   specific
       circumstances,  including   their   age,   physical   and   emotional
       development, the extent of his  emotional  ties  both  to  the  Union
       citizen parent and to the  third-country  national  parent,  and  the
       risks which separation from the latter might entail for that  child's
       equilibrium.


   17. Given Mr Singh's pragmatic stance, I can shortly state my reasons for
       finding that the Appellant's appeal must succeed.  Although  Zambrano
       was not directly relied upon,  that  authority  raises  an  issue  of
       fundamental rights which should be taken into account  by  the  Upper
       Tribunal once alerted to it.


   18. As stated by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 �49,  Ex.1
       "establishes as a starting point that leave should be granted  unless
       there are powerful reasons to the contrary"; albeit that �73: "It may
       be reasonable to require the child to  leave  where  there  are  good
       cogent reasons, even if they are not compelling." Accordingly it  was
       incumbent on the First-tier Tribunal to fully engage  with  the  best
       interests of the British citizen child, having regard to the starting
       point that it was necessary to identify powerful  reasons  justifying
       the reasonableness of her departure.


   19. The importance of that principle is greatly magnified by the Zambrano
       factor, given that it is difficult to see, if it is accepted that the
       Appellant is the sole carer of the child [E], how her departure would
       have any consequence other than the forced  departure  of  a  British
       citizen child. In the event that the father was willing to take  over
       [E]'s care, then the consequences for the  young  girl's  equilibrium
       and development would have to be considered, applying Chavez-Vilchez.


   20. Mr Aborisade sought to persuade me that the appeal could  be  allowed
       outright, on the basis that the refusal of  leave  to  the  Appellant
       necessarily involved the constructive expulsion of a British  citizen
       child. However, the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  any  clear
       finding as to the role of the Appellant's father in her  life.  Given
       the lack of clarity as to that issue shown in the witness  statements
       and supporting evidence, that is unsurprising. Accordingly the matter
       must be reheard. This is not an appeal  where  there  are  meaningful
       findings upon which the Upper Tribunal can  build,  and  thus  it  is
       allowed to the extent that it is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
       for hearing afresh.

Decision

The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.
