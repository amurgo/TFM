                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Nasim, Counsel instructed by Whitefields
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Metzer, who in a determination promulgated on  5th  May  2015,
    allowed Mr Akhter's appeal against a decision by the Secretary of State
    to refuse to issue him a residence card as confirmation of his right to
    reside in the UK as the unmarried partner of an EEA national exercising
    treaty  rights  under  Regulation  8(5)  of   the   Immigration   (EEA)
    Regulations 2006. The Secretary of State for the Home Department is the
    appellant in this hearing and Mr Akhter is the respondent. However, for
    the sake of convenience, I will refer to Mr Akhter as the claimant  and
    the Secretary of State for the Home Department as the respondent.

2.   The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan  date  of  birth  24th  September
    1977. He entered the United Kingdom on 29th January 2008 as  a  Tier  4
    Student.  He  met  his  wife  Marina  Bandzinaite  in  2010  and  their
    relationship commenced in June of that year. They underwent an  Islamic
    marriage on 8th December 2012.

3.   Following his application for the residence card  immigration  officers
    visited the property identified by the claimant as that in which he and
    his partner lived. The claimant was not present and, as a result  of  a
    conversation with somebody present at that  property,  the  immigration
    officers formed the view that the relationship was not genuine and that
    the marriage was one of convenience.

4.   Aggrieved with that decision the claimant appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  His appeal was  heard  on  13th  April  2015  where  he  was
    represented by Ms Nasim, who represents the  claimant  at  the  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal.  The Secretary of State was not represented.

5.   A bundle of documentation had been prepared on behalf of  the  claimant
    which was considered by the judge. The claimant was asked a  number  of
    questions.  Having considered the documentary and oral evidence  before
    him the judge concluded that the marriage  was  genuine.  As  a  direct
    consequence of this finding the judge allowed the appeal outright.

6.   The Secretary of State took issue with this approach.  In  her  grounds
    of appeal the Secretary of State relied on the case of Ihemedu (OFMs  -
    meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00340. This case  indicates  that  once  a
    Tribunal has concluded that the disputed EEA relationship  is  in  fact
    genuine it is not entitled to allow the appeal outright. The matter has
    to be returned to the Secretary of State to enable her to exercise  her
    discretion under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 in light of the Tribunal's findings of fact and in  light  of  all
    the circumstances.

7.   I  have  been  greatly  assisted  by  Ms  Nasim  and  by  Ms  Isherwood
    representing the Secretary of State. Ms Nasim did not seek to  persuade
    me that the First-tier Tribunal had not, in light of Ihemedu, committed
    an error of law. She accepted that the Judge's  failure  to  remit  the
    matter back to the Secretary of State was material.

8.   Ms Isherwood confirmed  that  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department did not challenge the substantive findings by the  judge  in
    respect of the claimant's relationship with his partner relationship.

9.   In these circumstances I am satisfied that there is  a  material  error
    of law in the determination and that  the  appeal  is  allowed  to  the
    extent that it is remitted back to the Secretary of State to enable her
    to reach a lawful decision in light of the judge's factual findings.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed to the  extent  that  the  matter
will be remitted back to the Secretary of State to enable  her  to  exercise
her discretion in light of the judge's findings.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As the claimant's appeal has been allowed and because a fee  has  been  paid
or is payable, I have considered making a fee  award  and  have  decided  to
make a whole fee award of ï¿½140 as the Secretary of State  was  not  entitled
to her conclusion that the claimant's relationship was not genuine.
