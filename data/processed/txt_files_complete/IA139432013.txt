                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Susan Clarke), sitting at Taylor House  on  23  October
    2013, to  a tier 4 (general) student appeal by a citizen of India, born
    17 August 1982. The only point at  issue  was  funding,  on  which  the
    appellant had to show, by bank statements sent in with his  application
    on 17 August 2012, a balance not falling below �1,600 for the  last  28
    days.

 2. Unfortunately the statements sent in then did show a  small  shortfall,
    at some point during the period covered, from 1  June  to  16  July.  A
    further set was sent in later, on the basis  of  which  it  was  argued
    before the judge that  the  balance  in  the  appellant's  account  had
    remained at over �2,000 from 20 July to 20 August 2012. The  difficulty
    with that submission, as the judge pointed out, was that no  20  August
    balance could have been shown by any  documents,  either  submitted  or
    accidentally left out of a submission made on the 17th.

 3. That mattered, since this was a points-based [PBS] case,  to  which  s.
    85A, as now enacted, of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002  applied,  together  with  exception  2  to   that   section   and
    consequently this sub-section:

       (4)    Where Exception 2 applies the Tribunal may consider  evidence
           adduced by the appellant only if it-
       (a)    was submitted in support of, and at the time of  making,  the
           application to which the immigration decision related,

 4. While there was and is,  at  that  time  under  the  former  evidential
    flexibility policy, and now under paragraph  245AA  of  the  Rules,  in
    favour of a document mistakenly left out of a  series  submitted,  that
    could not be  applied  so  as  to  create  a  new  base  date  for  the
    application, and rely on a different  series,  starting  and  finishing
    later.

 5. There is an issue between the appellant and the Home Office about  what
    exactly he did send in with his later submission; however even  if  his
    evidence about that was right, then for the  reasons  given  above,  it
    cannot allow him to succeed under the points-based system. A submission
    by Mr Balroop that his application should be treated as  continuing  up
    to the date of the decision, in line with previous authorities,  cannot
    succeed in the light of Raju & others [2013] EWCA Civ 754
