Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr G O'Ceallaich, Counsel, instructed by Maliks and
Khan Solicitors
For the Respondent:   Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 29 October 2018 of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge NMK  Lawrence  which  refused  an  Article  8  ECHR
    appeal.

 2. The  appellant's  claim  concerned  whether  the  actions  of  previous
    advisers, without his knowledge, had led to him becoming an  overstayer
    and so unable to show 10 years' continuous lawful residence. The First-
    Tier Tribunal found that the applicant was complicit in the actions  of
    his previous advisers. The applicant appealed where this had never been
    a point taken against him by the respondent.

 3. At the hearing, the respondent provided a copy  of  a  Rule  24  notice
    dated 4 January 2019 which accepted that  the  decision  of  First-Tier
    Tribunal Lawrence disclosed material error on a point of law and agreed
    that the appeal should be remitted to the First-Tier Tribunal  for  re-
    making. Mr Whitwell for the respondent  confirmed  that  this  was  the
    position as of the date of the hearing before us.

 4. In those  circumstances,  having  considered  the  grounds  of  appeal,
    decision of the First-Tier Tribunal and  other  documentation  in  this
    matter, we find an error on a point of law, set aside the  decision  of
    First-Tier Tribunal Lawrence and remit the appeal to be re-made de novo
    in the First-Tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside to be remade de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.
