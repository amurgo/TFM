                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Brazil born respectively in  1973,  2006
    and 2011. They have appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  a
    decision of the respondent to refuse leave to remain  on  human  rights
    grounds. The First-tier Tribunal,  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  20
    February 2020, dismissed the appeal. The appellants  now  appeal,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Granting permission on 15 September 2020,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gill
    indicated a provisional  view  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should be set aside for legal error and the appeal remitted to
    the First-tier Tribunal  for  a  hearing  de  novo.  The  parties  were
    informed that an order for remittal would be made in the event that  no
    objection was received from either party within 14 days  after  service
    of Upper Tribunal Judge Gills' decision. No objection has been received
    and accordingly I set aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
    None of the findings of fact shall stand. The appeal is returned to the
    First-tier Tribunal (not Judge Chohan) for that Tribunal to remake  the
    decision following a hearing de novo.

    following a hearing de novo.
