For the Appellant:     Mr Moran, Alex Moran Immigration and Asylum
For the Respondent:       Ms Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Syria date of birth 28th February  1998.
    She appeals with permission[1] the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge R.G Walters) to dismiss her appeal against a decision to  refuse
    to grant her entry clearance.




    Background


 2. The application for entry clearance was  made  on  the  11th  September
    2013. The basis of the application was that the Appellant is the  niece
    and adopted daughter of Mr Ibrahim Abdul Hamid  Abou  Swaid,  a  Syrian
    national with refugee status in the  United  Kingdom.    She  made  her
    application at the same time as Mr Abou Swaid's wife  and  three  sons.
    They were all granted entry  clearance  as  the  family  members  of  a
    refugee. The Appellant was refused with reference to paragraph  352D(i)
    because she is not Mr Abou Swaid's biological daughter. Indeed she  had
    never asserted that to the case, having plainly stated from the  outset
    that she is his de facto adopted daughter, having lived under his  care
    since she was five years old.  It was perhaps for that reason that  the
    ECO withdrew his original decision and invited the Appellant to  submit
    evidence establishing that she met the requirements of  paragraph  319X
    of the Immigration Rules, which  provides  for  entry  clearance  as  a
    "child of a relative with limited leave to remain as a refugee":
         319X. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom as the child of a relative with
         limited leave to remain as a refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian
         protection in the United Kingdom are that:
         (i) the applicant is seeking leave to enter or remain to join a
         relative with limited leave to enter or remain as a refugee or
         person with humanitarian protection; and:
         (ii) the relative has limited leave in the United Kingdom as a
         refugee or beneficiary of humanitarian protection and there are
         serious and compelling family or other considerations which make
         exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable arrangements have
         been made for the child's care; and
         (iii) the relative is not the parent of the child who is seeking
         leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom; and
         (iv) the applicant is under the age of 18; and
         (v) the applicant is not leading an independent life, is unmarried
         and is not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent
         family unit; and
         (vi) the applicant can, and will, be accommodated adequately by the
         relative the child is seeking to join without recourse to public
         funds in accommodation which the relative in the United Kingdom
         owns or occupies exclusively; and
         (vii) the applicant can, and will, be maintained adequately by the
         relative in the United Kingdom without recourse to public funds;
         and
         (viii) if seeking leave to enter, the applicant holds a valid
         United Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity or, if
         seeking leave to remain, holds valid leave to remain in this or
         another capacity.



 3. On the 11th February 2014 the Appellant's representative  informed  the
    Respondent that although satisfying all  other  requirements  of  319X,
    she could not show  that  she  could  be  maintained  and  accommodated
    without any additional recourse to public funds. She wished  to  pursue
    the application on Article 8 grounds alone.  In a fresh  refusal  dated
    12th March 2014 the Respondent indicated that  he  was  not  minded  to
    grant entry clearance  on  that  basis  since  there  was  insufficient
    evidence to demonstrate that the facts were as  claimed.  For  instance
    the only court document provided in respect  of  the  guardianship  was
    dated July 2013.


 4. The Appellant appealed on human rights grounds.  At that hearing it was
    established that since the decision the Sponsor Mr Abou Swaid had  come
    into funds such that he would be  able  to  meet  the  maintenance  and
    accommodation requirements the rules.  The  HOPO  relied  on  this  and
    submitted that the Appellant should make an application under 319X.  At
    paragraph 25 of  the  determination  the  reasoning  is  summed  up  as
    follows:

         "Having considered the evidence and the submissions, I did not find
         there are arguably good grounds for granting leave to enter outwith
         the Rules because I find an application under  paragraph  319X  may
         well succeed. Following the case of Gulshan,  I  therefore  do  not
         propose to engage on a 'Razgar' exercise".


      Error of Law

 5. I need not set out the parties' submissions in detail since  before  me
    Mr Moran and Ms Holmes were in agreement that the determination must be
    set aside. A surprising number of errors might be  identified  in  that
    short passage set out above, but it suffices to say that the First-tier
    Tribunal erred in dismissing an out of country entry  clearance  appeal
    against a decision dated the 12th March 2014 on the basis of  a  change
    in circumstance which post-dated that decision by some six months.  The
    task of the Tribunal was to assess whether, on the 12th March 2014, the
    decision of the ECO was a disproportionate interference with,  or  lack
    of respect for, this  young  lady's  private  and  family  life.    The
    determination manifestly fails to grapple with that question and it  is
    therefore set aside.


    The Re-Made Decision


      The Oral Evidence

 6. I heard oral evidence from four witnesses: the Sponsor Mr Ibrahim Abdul
    Hamid Abou Swaid, his wife Mrs Manar Abou Swaid, her brother  Mr  Ziyad
    Abdul Hamid Abo Sweed and his wife Rasha Adnan Al Lakud.





 7. Mr Abou Swaid confirmed his statement dated  29th  September  2015  was
    true.   He explains therein that he and his wife came to care  for  the
    Appellant after her mother remarried. The Appellant's  own  father  had
    disappeared whilst working in Iraq when she was a toddler, and when she
    was five her mother had married again.  Mr  Abou  Swaid  is  the  elder
    brother of the Appellant's mother. In Syria it is often the  case  that
    new husbands will refuse to take children from another man  into  their
    family. So it was with the Appellant. Her mother's new husband did  not
    want to take her, and so she came to Mr Abou Swaid. In his evidence  he
    said that from that day on, when she was five years old, she has  lived
    with him and his wife. He explained that he continued to seek  guidance
    from her paternal grandfather as a formality/custom, but he was an  old
    man and in fact it was the Abou Swaid's who took  the  decisions  about
    the Appellant's life as well as the day-to-day care.  Ms  Holmes  asked
    about the whereabouts of the Appellant's  mother.   The  Appellant  had
    seen her from time to time as she grew up when the trouble  started  in
    2011 she and her husband moved far away to another part of Syria, about
    350km away from Damascus. At present no-one has had  any  contact  with
    them and their whereabouts are unknown. Even if they could be found the
    Appellant cannot turn to them  for  support  for  the  reasons  already
    outlined: "if he would not take her when she was  a  little  girl,  why
    will he take her now?".


 8. When the Appellant came to live with the  Abou  Swaids  they  had  just
    married.  Mrs Abou Swaid was pregnant with  their  first  child.   They
    didn't get any formal paperwork - they  never  needed  to.  It  was  an
    arrangement within the family.   Mr Abou Swaid explained  that  he  and
    his wife have three sons. The Appellant is therefore  very  special  as
    she is their only daughter. He became emotional  as  he  described  how
    difficult it has been for the family to  be  separated.  He  said  that
    whenever he speaks to the Appellant he promises her that he  is  trying
    to resolve her situation and bring her here.  He describes her as being
    a "beautiful, quiet girl". He said that she is "very sweet -  everybody
    likes her".      She is a good student -  her  favourite  subjects  are
    Arabic and maths, and she also speaks English. He manages  to  talk  to
    her now about twice a week - his wife more often. They use 'apps'  such
    as 'whatsapp' and 'viber' so  communication  depends  on  the  internet
    working. Because of the fighting it can go down sometimes and then they
    cannot speak.

 9. The background to the family being separated was explained as  follows.
    In November 2012 they were all living together in  their  family  home.
    The neighbourhood was attacked suddenly one night. Everyone  was  stuck
    in their homes. When the firing stopped they took the chance to flee  -
    they  grabbed  their  passports  and  essential  items  and  left  very
    suddenly. They went to Dara'a. Mr Abou Swaid explained  that  they  had
    not really thought at that time that they would not be able  to  return
    to their home.  They had hoped to do so, but it didn't  work  out  like
    that. When it became apparent that they needed to get out of Syria they
    decided that Mr Abou Swaid should go first. He didn't want to take  the
    family because the journey was dangerous.   Once he got to the  UK  and
    obtained refugee status, the family made their application.

10. Mr Abou Swaid appeared to find it difficult to  talk  about  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer's decision. In his oral evidence he  looked  strained
    and upset when he spoke about  the  decision  to  leave  the  Appellant
    behind after his wife and sons were granted  entry  clearance:  "I  was
    faced with the terrible choice of leaving all my family  in  danger  in
    Syria so that they could stay with Deana, or leaving Deana behind alone
    with relatives. In the end, I  decided  that  I  couldn't  risk  losing
    everyone I loved and so my wife and sons travelled here".

11. When they left the Appellant was left with his wife's  sister  and  her
    husband. Although obviously she knew them beforehand she was not  close
    to them and so this was not ideal, but it was the only choice. They are
    living in a suburb of Damascus called al-Tadhamon.  It  is  immediately
    adjacent called Yarmouk, a neighbourhood which has very  recently  been
    taken over by ISIL.  At the date of the decision the security situation
    there was poor but it  is  even  worse  now.  There  was  shelling  and
    fighting between the government and the rebels, but now  the  situation
    is even more precarious. The Appellant  is  effectively  stuck  in  the
    house. She cannot go out because it is too dangerous. She has not  been
    to school for two years. She feels uncomfortable  because  she  is  not
    with her own family.  The adults have to travel to a different district
    to get food for the family - the shops are all  shut  where  they  are.
    Every time they go out they do not know what to expect  - they could be
    attacked at any time.   As  well  as  the  fighting  people  are  being
    arrested - on both sides of the line.

12. Mr Abou Swaid was asked why, now  that  he  is  able  to  maintain  and
    accommodate the Appellant, he could not simply make another application
    for her, as was suggested before the First-tier Tribunal. He  explained
    that the  journey  from  Damascus  to  either  Beirut  (previously  the
    relevant post) or Amman (as it is now) are difficult and dangerous. She
    does not have papers to cross the border and it is hard for her  to  do
    this.   The process is expensive. It was put to him that he  failed  to
    provide much documentary evidence about their life with the  Appellant.
    He said that everything that they had had, such as school  reports,  or
    more photographs, were all left in the family home when they fled  that
    night in November 2012. It is not possible for anyone to retrieve  them
    now.  They are pursuing this appeal  because  they  want  the  quickest
    possible route for the Appellant. His wife's sister and her family want
    to move to Jordan but they cannot take the Appellant with them  because
    she has no papers. The only thing that is keeping them there is waiting
    for the Appellant to be granted entry clearance.


13. Mrs Manar Abou Swaid adopted her witness statement dated 29th September
    2015. She said that she  was  married  in  August  2001  and  that  the
    Appellant came to live with them at the beginning of 2003, when she was
    pregnant with their eldest son. It had been a joint  decision  to  take
    her in.  Mrs Abou Swaid described the Appellant as being a  "beautiful,
    calm" girl whom she thought of as her daughter. Because she is the only
    girl they share a "special bond".  She said that all they wish  for  is
    the Appellant to be with them:  "leaving  Deana  in  Damascus  was  the
    toughest thing I have ever done and I  have  been  wracked  with  guilt
    since the moment we left Syria".   She says that every time she  speaks
    to her sister she tells her that they want to leave and that she  needs
    to sort out the Appellant's situation.   They have two  sons  of  their
    own and they are all living in one bedroom and one living area.  It  is
    very stressful for all of them.

14. Ziyad Abo Sweed and his wife  Rasha  Al  Lakud  adopted  their  witness
    statements, both dated 29th April 2015. These served to confirm that to
    their personal knowledge the Appellant  has  lived  with  her  adoptive
    parents since she was a little girl. Ms Holmes  had  no  questions  for
    either of these witnesses.



    The Documentary Evidence

15. The Respondent's bundle contains the evidence submitted by  the  family
    after the Appellant was first refused.  After  the  ECO  had  requested
    further evidence they managed to obtain a court order from  the  Deputy
    Sharia Judge of Nawa Abdulmajid Badawah, made under the Law of Personal
    Status. Having heard from Mr Abou Swaid's lawyer, having had regard  to
    the fact that the Appellant's paternal grandfather had no objection and
    that her father is missing for over ten years,  Judge  Badawah  ordered
    that Mr Abou Swaid has full legal guardianship. The order is dated 10th
    July 2013.  There is further written confirmation from the  Appellant's
    birth mother stating  that  she  has  no  objection  to  the  Appellant
    travelling with Mr Abou Swaid who she  describes  as  having  been  the
    legal guardian since the date of her marriage.


16. Both  Respondent's  and  Appellant's  bundles  contained  a  number  of
    photographs of the Appellant at various ages with the Abou Swaid's  and
    their  children.   The  Appellant's  bundle  also  contained   numerous
    "screenshots" of her 'whatsapp' correspondence with family  members  in
    the UK.

17. Payslips and tax credit correspondence was also provided to demonstrate
    the family's current income.



    My Findings

18. I have no hesitation in finding the evidence given in this appeal to be
    entirely  credible.  Mr  and  Mrs  Abou  Swaid  spoke  at  length  with
    consistency and detail about their relationship with the Appellant  and
    the strain of separation from her was very evident in both of them.   I
    find as fact that the Appellant has been the de facto adopted  daughter
    of the Abou Swaids since she was five  and  that  more  recently  Judge
    Badawah of the Sharia Court in Nawa has ordered that Mr Abou  Swaid  be
    considered her legal guardian as a matter of Syrian law.  I accept  and
    find as fact that there is a family life  between  the  Appellant,  her
    adoptive parents and brothers in the UK.  I  do  so  having  recognised
    that Article 8 requires the decision-maker to focus on the substance of
    the claimed relationship rather than the formality: Singh v ECO  [2004]
    EWCA Civ 1075.


19. I find as fact that the refusal to grant her entry clearance amounts to
    an interference with, or 'lack of respect' for her family life. All  of
    her family members are refugees in the UK and cannot return to Syria.

20. There is no dispute that the decision was one that the  Respondent  was
    in law entitled to make, or that the denial of entry to persons who  do
    not meet the requirements of the Rules is rationally connected  to  the
    legitimate Article 8(2) aim of protecting the economy.

21. The Immigration Act  2014  amended  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 to insert into  the  statute  mandatory  considerations
    when weighing proportionality. I have had regard to these factors,  set
    out in section  117B.    The  maintenance  of  immigration  control  is
    clearly in the public interest: I have attached  great  weight  to  the
    fact that at the date of decision the Appellant failed to qualify under
    the Rules.  I agree  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  that  the
    Appellant is able to speak English because if  she  does  she  will  be
    better placed to integrate. I have heard credible  oral  evidence  from
    her parents that she does, and I further find that as a teenager she is
    likely to quickly improve her language skills after arrival.  I  accept
    that it is in the public interest that  the  Appellant  is  financially
    self-sufficient. I bear in mind that at the date of  the  decision  her
    family did not have sufficient  funds  to  support  her  to  the  level
    required by the Rules (although I acknowledge that that  situation  has
    changed now that Mr Abou Swaid is in employment).    The  remainder  of
    the provisions in the Act are not relevant since the Appellant seeks to
    protect a family life that was established and has been maintained when
    she was outside the UK.

22. I have balanced the Appellant's failure under  the  Rules  against  the
    factors in her favour. I remind myself that the number of cases  likely
    to succeed on Article 8 grounds where they have failed under the  Rules
    is expected to be very small, indeed exceptional. I am quite  satisfied
    that this is such a case.

23. The nature and quality of the Appellant's family life with her  parents
    and siblings is immense. She is a child of this  family,  and  she  has
    been separated from them by  a  perfect  storm  of  brutal  civil  war,
    bureaucracy and circumstance. Having been entirely dependent upon  them
    for her entire conscious life I accept that she will be  depressed  and
    bewildered by their separation. For  their  parts  I  accept  that  her
    parents are devastated by  having  made  the  choice  that  they  have,
    albeit in desperate circumstances. I attach some weight to the sense of
    loss that they and their sons are also suffering : Beoku-Betts  v  SSHD
    [2008] UKHL 39,  R (Ahmadi and Ahmadi) v SSHD [2005] EWCA Civ 1721.

24. The Appellant's situation at the date of  decision  was  difficult  and
    dangerous. She is living in a suburb of Damascus that has been affected
    by the ongoing conflict. I accept the oral evidence of her parents that
    she is confined indoors, sharing a space of two rooms with  two  adults
    and two other children. She has not attended school for two years, even
    though she is a good student who enjoys her education. Without  friends
    or stimulation she is presently living a very limited existence. She is
    deprived of her family life with those closest to her; but  is  further
    denied an effective private life.  The extent of  the  interference  is
    therefore substantial.

25. Mr Moran has very helpfully set out a schedule of  income  for  the  UK
    based family, and a KA (Pakistan) [2006] UKAIT 00065  comparator  table
    showing that the present weekly income of �449.10 is in excess  of  the
    �396.47 that a family of two adults and four children would receive  on
    benefits.  It was no doubt this evidence which led Judge Morgan to make
    the findings that he did about paragraph 319X. Whilst I accept that  Mr
    Abou Swaid does now have that income from his work and tax  credits  it
    is not something that I am going to attach weight to in the context  of
    the decision on Article 8. That is because it is very difficult to  say
    that this financial security was something  reasonably  foreseeable  to
    the ECO when he took his decision in March 2014.  Although  I  have  no
    reason to doubt that Mr and Mrs  Abou  Swaid  wish  to  work  hard  and
    provide for their family, this income is not  something  that  the  ECO
    could have predicted then.

26. Having considered all of the evidence  I  consider  that  it  would  be
    wholly disproportionate to refuse to issue this young lady  with  entry
    clearance today. To expect her to make an arduous and dangerous journey
    to make another application, and then to wait yet more months away from
    her family until it is dealt with, is  contrary to her  best  interests
    and disproportionate. In the circumstances it cannot  be  shown  to  be
    necessary in a democratic society in pursuit of any of the aims set out
    in Article 8(2).


      Decisions


27. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law
    and it is set aside.

28. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows:


    "The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.
        The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds."




    Directions


29. There was no request for an anonymity direction and I see no reason  to
    make one.


30. This appeal concerns a minor who is the last member  of  her  immediate
    family left in Syria. The decision was contrary to Article  8  when  it
    was taken.  The Appellant  currently  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules. There is therefore no justification for any further delay, which
    would be contrary to the  Appellant's  best  interests.   Although  the
    Respondent is not in this situation bound by the terms of  s55  of  the
    Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 policy dictates  that  he
    must have regard to the Appellant's welfare. I find  that  any  further
    delay in the reunion of this family would be  wholly  contrary  to  her
    best interests. I therefore direct that entry clearance be granted upon
    receipt of this determination.
