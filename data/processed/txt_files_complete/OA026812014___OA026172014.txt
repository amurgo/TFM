Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Hodgetts (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms Pal (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The  appellants  are  citizens  of  Nepal.  The  first-named  appellant
    (hereinafter referred to as "the appellant") is 65  years  of  age  and
    applied for entry clearance under the Immigration Rules.  Her  husband,
    the second-named appellant, also applied at the same time but sadly  he
    died on October 14, 2014 (prior to this hearing but after the  original
    hearing). The respondent refused both applications on January 20,  2014
    on the grounds they did not satisfy the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM
    Section E-ECDR.

 2. The appellant (and her husband) appealed under  section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on February 17, 2014.

 3. The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Vaudin
    d'Imecourt (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") on June 18, 2014 and
    in a decision promulgated on June 20, 2014 he dismissed the appellants'
    appeals under both the Immigration Rules and article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellant (and her husband) lodged grounds of appeal  on  July  10,
    2014. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Davidge  refused  permission  to
    appeal on September 2, 2014 finding that the FtTJ  made  findings  that
    were open to him.

 5. The appellant (and her husband) renewed  their  grounds  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal and on January 8, 2015 Upper Tribunal Judge  Chalkley  granted
    permission finding it was arguable the FtTJ had erred.

 6. The respondent filed a Rule 24 response dated January 16, 2015 in which
    she submitted correctly addressed all the issues.

 7. The matter came before me on the date set out above and  on  that  date
    the appellant was represented by  direct  access  Counsel  as  detailed
    above.

 8. I was handed the  second-named  appellant's  death  certificate  and  I
    placed that document on the court file.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 9. Mr Hodgetts initially sought  permission  to  rely  on  the  unreported
    decision of Timiro Osman (contained in appellant's undated bundle).  He
    submitted that  the  decision  was  on  E-ECDR  2.5  and  would  be  of
    assistance. Ms  Pal  objected  and  submitted  that  in  order  foe  an
    unreported decision to be relied the President's Practice direction had
    to be followed and it had not  so  no  regard  should  be  had  to  its
    contents.


10. I considered Guidance Note 2011 No 2 and in  particular  paragraph  [4]
    which states "...By  the  terms  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Direction 11 unreported decisions of the Chamber may not  be  cited  as
    authority without permission of the judge that  will  only  be  granted
    sparingly where there is good reason to do so."

11. No such permission had been sought and I indicated to Mr Hodgetts  that
    no weight would be attached to the decision although there was  nothing
    to prevent him from making  similar  submissions  if  he  felt  it  was
    appropriate.





    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

12. Mr Hodgetts adopted his grounds of appeal and submitted Section  E-ECDR
    2.5 of Appendix  FM  required  the  decision  maker  to  make  explicit
    findings on what was the required level of care. The required level  of
    care refers back to Section E-ECDR 2.4 and both  sections  need  to  be
    considered together. He submitted the care that had to be provided  was
    "personal"  rather  than  support  provided  by  mechanical   aids   or
    medication and should  be  provided  by  a  person.  He  submitted  the
    personal care included both emotional and psychological care.  At  date
    of decision the second-named appellant was  suffering  from  a  serious
    illness and the FtTJ failed  to  have  regard  to  what  was  meant  by
    palliative care. Personal care is care package for the whole family and
    he submitted the FtTJ failed to engage with what the required level  of
    care was at the date of decision. The FtTJ  did  not  demonstrate  from
    paragraph [22] onwards any engagement with the  medical  evidence  that
    had been submitted. The FtTJ failed to have regard to paragraph [4]  of
    the second-named  appellant's  statement  in  which  he  described  the
    problems the appellant was experiencing or the content of  the  medical
    report contained at pages C5 and C6 of the original appellants' bundle.
    At paragraph [22] the FtTJ made no findings on this medical evidence or
    have regard to the fact the appellant was unable  to  perform  everyday
    tasks because the second-named appellant was seriously ill at the  date
    of decision and the appellant had to deal with  the  fact  the  second-
    named appellant was dying. The FtTJ failed to deal with required  level
    of care or have regard to  the  emotional  levels  of  palliative  care
    package. The FtTJ totally ignored the medical  evidence  that  suggests
    there is no one able to provide the affectionate and loving care needed
    and the fact the second-named appellant's cancer affected the wife  and
    caused her abdominal pain. Mr Hodgetts submitted  palliative  care  was
    needed to reduce the appellant's stress and the  FtTJ  failed  to  have
    regard to this. The FtTJ also wrongly concluded there was  evidence  of
    nursing homes when the medical report and the letter from the  District
    Health Office suggested there were no such facilities. The FtTJ  failed
    to have regard to cultural issues and failed  to  have  regard  to  the
    level of care the appellant required. As regards the FtTJ's approach to
    article 8 he submitted the FtTJ had erred because he had  not  followed
    the approach suggested in in Ganesabalan, R (On the Application  of)  v
    SSHD [2014] EWHC 2712 (Admin) where it was found  there  was  no  prior
    threshold which dictates whether the exercise of discretion  should  be
    considered; rather the nature of the assessment and the reasoning which
    were called for were informed by threshold considerations.  Whilst  the
    FtTJ dealt with article 8 he did so in one short  paragraph  and  found
    they were a complete code. The Rules in this appeal were not a complete
    code. The proportionality test he applied in paragraphs [10]  and  [11]
    was not wide enough and his reasoning was incomplete. The  FtTJ  failed
    to have regard to the granddaughter's letter and the fact she had lived
    with the appellant for the first ten years of her life. Her letter  and
    his  response  (in  his   statement)   amounted   to   compelling   and
    compassionate circumstances. As the economic well-being of the  country
    was protected the appeal should have been allowed.

13. Ms Pal relied on  the  Rule  24  letter  dated  January  16,  2015  and
    submitted  the  FtTJ  had  regard  to  the  appellants'  full   medical
    conditions and whilst there was only a  brief  reference  in  paragraph
    [22] of his determination the FtTJ accepted they needed care. The  FtTJ
    then considered their position in paragraph [24] of  his  determination
    where he found that the care needed did not need to come from relatives
    or friends but could be provided by other persons. In doing so  he  had
    regard to the IDI guidance. His finding about long-term care  was  open
    to him because the appellants, at the date of decision, were  receiving
    care from carers and the sponsors were paying for such care. There  was
    no error in law in respect of the decision under the Immigration Rules.
    As regards article 8 she  submitted  his  findings  in  paragraph  [26]
    demonstrated the appellants did not meet the Immigration Rules  and  he
    then considered their circumstances outside of  the  Immigration  Rules
    and he found that even if did consider their circumstances  outside  of
    the Rules the outcome would be the same. She referred to  the  decision
    of Singh & Khaled [2015] EWCA Civ 74 where the  Court  of  Appeal  held
    there was no need to fully examine all of the issues afresh where  they
    had been properly considered under the Rules. There is  limited  family
    life between a grandchild and grandparent. The child's  primary  family
    life must be with her parents in the United Kingdom  as  they  provided
    both financial and emotional support. She can maintain contact with the
    appellant in Nepal in much the same way she had been  doing  since  she
    came here. There was no material error.


14. Mr Hodgetts responded to these submissions and argued the  decision  of
    Singh did not mean a court  should  never  consider  the  circumstances
    afresh because in this appeal the Rules did not take into  account  the
    extent of family life for the  grandchild  and  the  reasonableness  of
    relocation. The Respondent accepted the FtTJ did not take into  account
    all of the appellants' symptoms and he did not comment on the  required
    level of care. His findings that people other than family  and  friends
    can provide assistance failed to have regard to emotional support  that
    was needed.

15. I reserved my decision.

    ERROR OF LAW ASSESSMENT

16. The appellants were husband and wife  and  together  they  applied  for
    admission under the Immigration  Rules.  It  was  agreed  that  if  the
    appellants met the requirements of Section E-ECDR 2.5  of  Appendix  FM
    then the appellant's appeal (her husband is  now  deceased)  should  be
    allowed.


17. In considering whether there is an error of law I have to  have  regard
    to the position facing the FtTJ and I have  to  disregard  the  second-
    named appellant's death.

18. I have set out above Mr Hodgett's submissions and  in  considering  his
    submissions I have also had regard to the grounds  of  appeal  that  he
    drafted following the FtTJ's decision. I have also considered both  the
    Rule 24 response and Ms Pal's oral submissions.

19. For the reasons set out in paragraphs [10] and  [11]  above  I  do  not
    place any weight on the decision of Timiro Osman but I  see  no  reason
    why I should not consider  Mr  Hodgetts's  submissions  on  the  points
    raised in that decision. However, those points have  to  be  considered
    alongside the approach the FtTJ was invited to take by the  appellants'
    original counsel. In particular,  he  referred  the  FtTJ  to  the  IDI
    guidelines and they are  set  out  in  paragraph  [21]  of  the  FtTJ's
    determination.

20. Mr Hodgetts submitted the FtTJ failed to  make  findings  on  what  the
    required level of care was. Section E-ECDR  2.5  makes  clear  that  in
    order to meet the Immigration Rules the  appellants  must  be  "unable,
    even with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,  to  obtain
    the required level of care in the country where they are living because
    (a) it is not available and there is no person in that country who  can
    reasonably provide it; or (b) it is not affordable".

21. There was no dispute that the sponsor was financially able to meet  the
    cost of any care as he had  demonstrated  an  ability  to  support  his
    parents for a number of years.

22. Mr Hodgetts argued that the FtTJ failed to have regard to the fact  the
    second-named appellant was terminally  ill  and  needed  emotional  and
    psychological care. I disagree with Mr Hodgetts.

23. In paragraph  [22]  the  FtTJ  acknowledged  both  appellants'  medical
    conditions and was aware that the appellant was suffering  considerable
    stress as a result of  her  husband's  condition.  The  FtTJ  noted  in
    paragraph [23] that the sponsor paid for two carers and in addition  to
    the funds available to him  there  was  a  sum  in  excess  of  �40,000
    following the sale of the appellants' property.

24. In paragraph [24] the FtTJ spelt out why he concluded that  Section  E-
    ECDR 2.5 was not met. He noted  the  second-named  appellant  had  been
    hospitalised as a result of his condition and there were clearly nurses
    available to provide the appropriate care.

25. Mr Hodgetts submitted the FtTJ  was  wrong  in  stating  there  was  no
    evidence that there were any nursing homes available and he referred me
    to the medical report and a letter at page D5 of the  original  bundle.
    The letter at page D5 does not say there were  no  nursing  homes.  The
    letter refers to there being  no  agencies  or  state  run  assistance.
    Neither of those statements undermines what the FtTJ found. The  letter
    from the hospital found on pages  C5  to  C7  indicates  there  are  no
    geriatric and terminal care homes. Section E-ECDR 2.5 does not  require
    such places. There is no dispute there are  both  nurses  and  hospital
    facilities who provide medical assistance and care and I  am  satisfied
    that even if there are no places that it is submitted the  second-named
    appellant should have been placed in there is nevertheless places where
    the second-named appellant was being cared for. The FtTJ  was  entitled
    this satisfied the requirement in Section E-ECDR 2.5.

26. Mr Hodgetts also  argued  that  the  FtTJ  failed  to  have  regard  to
    palliative care. There is a difference between what a person  may  want
    and what is being offered. There is nothing  in  the  medical  evidence
    that suggests the appellants were not offered assistance or  care.  The
    FtTJ was aware of the level of care available and he was also aware  of
    the second-named appellant's condition.

27. Mr Hodgett's submitted that "best  medical  practice"  was  to  provide
    family support. However, the FtTJ was not concerned with what was  best
    but  merely  whether  the  second-named  appellant  could  receive  the
    required level of care. There is nothing in  the  medical  report  that
    suggests the hospital could not treat him if he  had  to  be  admitted.
    There is no doubt that his wish was to pass away with his  son  by  his
    side but that is not the test to be applied. The IDI guidelines make it
    clear that not only family members but also professionals  can  provide
    care.

28. Mr Hodgetts argued that personal care means exactly and I am  satisfied
    the FtTJ had regard to that fact. The FtTJ was satisfied  he  could  be
    properly cared for by carers and this is not a case where his care  was
    going to be based on a mechanical aid. The nature of  the  second-named
    appellant's condition was that he would need medication but that was  a
    part of his care.

29. Whilst the FtTJ had sympathy for the second-named appellant's condition
    there were people able to care for him  and  taking  into  account  his
    condition it may well be that they were the most appropriate people  to
    be providing that help.

30. Having carefully considered Mr Hodgett's  submissions  I  am  satisfied
    that all of the findings made were open to  the  FtTJ.  In  considering
    this appeal under the Immigration Rules I am satisfied he made findings
    that were open to him. There was no error in law.

31. The second aspect of the appeal related to  the  FtTJ's  assessment  on
    human rights. Mr Hodgetts submitted the correct approach as set out  in
    Ganesabalan had not been followed. Again, I disagree.

32. In considering the FtTJ's approach to article  8  it  is  necessary  to
    consider his overall approach. Whilst I accept he began paragraph  [26]
    applying a two-stage test he nevertheless went on to find that even  if
    article 8 was engaged it would not be disproportionate  to  refuse  the
    appeals. The FtTJ carefully considered all of the medical evidence  and
    whilst I accept he did not place  any  weight  on  the  granddaughter's
    wishes I do not overlook Ms Pal's submission that she has  lived  apart
    from the appellants for around six years and he best interest are  with
    her parents-with whom she lives. She receives emotional  and  financial
    support from her parents and whilst clearly she wants her  grandparents
    with her I am not satisfied that the failure to  specifically  consider
    this amounts to an error  in  law.  The  FtTJ  took  into  account  the
    granddaughter could visit her grandmother with her family and of course
    as stated before they had lived  apart  for  six  years  and  they  had
    maintained family life in the years they had been apart.

33. I am satisfied the FtTJ did consider the claims  under  article  8  and
    reached findings that were open to him.

Decision

34. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  in
    law and I uphold the original decision and I  dismiss  the  appellants'
    appeals.

35. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier and I see  no  reason  to  amend  that
    order.
