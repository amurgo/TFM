Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Eaton (Counsel instructed by BHT Immigration
                    Legal Services)
For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This matter comes before me as an error  of  law  hearing  to  consider
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision made by
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Malins) ("FtT") who in  a  decision  and
    reasons promulgated on 7 August 2015 dismissed the appellants'  appeals
    against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  refuse  international
    protection.

2.   The appellants are all citizens of  China.   The  first  appellant  and
    second appellant  are  husband  and  wife  and  the  third  and  fourth
    appellants are their children.  The basis of the appellants' claim  was
    that in having three children the one-child policy was contravened with
    the result that a  fine  of  200,000  RMB  was  imposed  on  the  first
    appellant and that she  was  liable  to  forcible  sterilisation  as  a
    resident  of  the  Jiangxi  Province,  and  furthermore  that  she  was
    subjected to a serious sexual assault by a  man  in  authority  between
    August 2013 and April 2014.

Summary of relevant findings made by the FtT

3.   The FtT heard evidence from five  witnesses  including  the  first  and
    second appellants, the first appellant's mother-in-law and  sister  and
    the second appellant's aunt. The FtT referred  to  the  COIR  dated  12
    October 2012 section on family planning (one-child policy) and  to  the
    country guidance case of AX (Family planning scheme)  China  CG  [2012]
    UKUT 00097.

4.   The FtT found that there had never been any attempts  on  the  part  of
    the authorities in China to forcibly sterilise the appellant [11E].

5.   That before the appellant left China to come to the UK she  could  have
    paid the outstanding amount of the fine owed in the sum of 176,808  RMB
    [11J].  The FtT rejected as untrue the appellant's numerous  assertions
    that she had to leave China because she was  unable  to  pay  the  fine
    imposed by the family planning authorities [11K].

6.   The FtT found that the appellants' firstborn  child  had  been  legally
    adopted by her sister-in-law and as from December 2012 was a citizen of
    Sweden.

7.   The FtT found that the firstborn child  was  no  longer  a  citizen  of
    China  and  that  the  appellant's  two  Chinese  children  were   both
    registered on the family rural hukou.

8.   The FtT found that the appellant was able to  move  to  the  city  away
    from the rural area where she lived for one year and relied on AX which
    confirmed that pregnancy tests could be conducted from a long distance.



9.   The FtT found at [11Q]:

         "Crucially the second appellant told me that as a couple he and his
         wife do not wish to have more children.  That  being  the  case,  I
         find the appellant's refusal to undertake sterilisation in  company
         with not only millions of fellow Chinese, but millions of women  in
         the UK, to be not credible: it is day  surgery  with  benefits.   I
         reject the appellant's evidence on this predicated on her  mother's
         claimed  experience  as  to  which,  there  is  in  any  event,  no
         evidence."

10.  The FtT found that there was no real risk of  forced  sterilisation  to
    the appellant based on the objective  evidence  and  that  breaches  of
    family planning regulations were a matter of  civil  law  not  criminal
    law.

11.   As  to  the  allegation  of  rape,  the  FtT  found  that  the  sexual
    relationship was consensual; the result of mental  pressure.   The  FtT
    rejected the appellant's claim to have been raped  by  an  official  in
    authority in its entirety.

12.  At [12]  the  FtT  specifically  considered  the  issue  of  the  first
    appellant's  credibility  and  found  that  she  had  given   dishonest
    evidence.  The FtT went on to conclude that the appellant had  taken  a
    conscious decision to have a third pregnancy motivated by the desire to
    have a son and then she had made cynical arrangements to divest herself
    of the first daughter by sending her to Sweden and  thereafter  engaged
    in a plan to manipulate the Immigration Regulations. At [12.2] the  FtT
    found that the evidence of  the  remaining  four  witnesses'  was  less
    crucial and that they were in collusion with the appellant's  plan  and
    evidence.

13.  Having considered and made findings as to credibility the FtT  at  [14]
    referred to the expert evidence of Stephanie Gordon.  It found that the
    expert evidence was not reliable because it contradicted the background
    evidence in the COIR.  It rejected  the  expert  evidence  because  the
    expert had never met with the appellant.  The FtT placed no weight on a
    psychologist's report because it took the  view  that  the  report  was
    predicated on dishonest evidence.

Grounds for Permission to Appeal

14.  Ground 1 - the FtT failed to consider  material  evidence  produced  by
    the appellants in support of their appeals including:

    (1)  a letter from the village committee setting out  the  fine  to  be
         paid  and  that  the  appellant  must  subject  herself  to  forced
         sterilisation by 2014;

    (2)  testimonials from three women from the first appellant's  province
         who had to undergo forced sterilisation;

    (3)  a testimonial from a former member of the family  planning  office
         in the appellants' province confirming women were forcibly arrested
         and sterilised;

    (4)  the family's hukou document.

         In addition there was no reference made  to  the  written  or  oral
         evidence provided by the second appellant's mother,  the  aunt  and
         the sister.

15.  Ground 2 - the FtT reached a perverse conclusion as to  why  the  first
    appellant was unwilling to go  forced  sterilisation  in  finding  that
    there was no objective  risk  of  forced  sterilisation.   This  is  in
    contradiction to the conclusions reached in AX and established  in  the
    background material. In AX it was concluded that  forced  sterilisation
    amounted to persecutory treatment and that forced  sterilisation  could
    occur in areas  where  there  had  been  a  crackdown  on  unauthorised
    pregnancies.  The Reasons for Refusal Letter (paragraph 40) referred to
    forced sterilisation reported in the Jiangxi Province.  The  FtT  erred
    in finding that there was no specific reference to forced sterilisation
    in Jiangxi Province, the appellants' home province, which in  fact  was
    specifically referred to in the COIR September 2013 Annex H.   The  FtT
    erred in failing to consider  the  background  material  including  the
    country  expert  report  of  Stephanie  Gordon  and  further  objective
    evidence in the appellants'  bundle  as  regards  the  risk  of  forced
    sterilisation.

16.  Ground 3 -  the  FtT's  finding  that  the  appellant's  forced  sexual
    relationship with the  head  of  the  family  planning  committee,  was
    perverse.  The FtT reasoned that the appellant did not become  pregnant
    and secondly that the relationship  followed  from    mental  pressure.
    The appellant's account was  corroborated  in  a  report  by  Dr  Lissa
    Morrish who made a diagnosis of post-traumatic  stress  disorder.   The
    FtT erred in reaching findings of fact made in isolation of the medical
    evidence and further in giving no weight to the medical evidence itself
    because it found that the report was premised on dishonest evidence.

17.  Ground 4 -  the  FtT  failed  to  consider  the  expert  evidence  from
    Stephanie Gordon as to material aspects of the appellant's claim,  made
    findings  on  credibility  without  reference  to  the  report  and  in
    particular the  expert's  corroboration  of  the  documentary  evidence
    relied on.

18.  Ground 5 - the FtT made clear errors of fact  by  failing  to  consider
    relevant  oral  evidence  regarding  the  appellant's  credibility   in
    particular as regards her ability to pay off the fine.  The FtT wrongly
    found that the appellants had funds  of  �21,014  available.   The  FtT
    miscalculated the amounts held in the  applicant's  bank  accounts  and
    wrongly took into account a deposit of �15,000  when  in  fact  it  was
    money belonging to the appellant's husband's aunt.

19.  Further factual errors were made with reference to  an  interview  with
    the appellant in which she was asked whether it was possible to  remove
    the child from the hukou, in response to which her answer was "I  don't
    know - I have never made enquiries about this".

20.  The FtT made no reference to the appellants'  evidence  that  they  had
    lived on the run between 2008 and 2012 and that it was  only  after  it
    became untenable to continue without registering their son on the hukou
    that they returned to their home village.

Permission to Appeal

21.  First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin granted  permission  to  appeal.   It
    was arguable that the FtT erred in finding that  it  was  not  credible
    that the appellant was not prepared to  undergo  sterilisation  and  in
    failing to follow the  country  guidance  case  of  AX.   It  was  also
    arguable that the FtT erred in making perverse findings  in  connection
    to the appellant's rape  and  the  supportive  psychological  evidence.
    Thirdly, it was considered an arguable error of law that the FtT failed
    to consider or adequately consider the expert evidence.

Rule 24 Response

22.  In a response dated 8 September 2015 the respondent opposed the  appeal
    and submitted that the  FtT  had  appropriately  directed  itself,  had
    sufficient regard to the country guidance in AX and arrived at  adverse
    findings in light of the same [13].  It further submitted that the  FtT
    at [11] made detailed and lengthy adverse  credibility  findings  which
    were sustainable.  The expert evidence was considered at [14]  and  the
    FtT was entitled to find the report to be of little assistance for  the
    reasons given.

23.  It was submitted that the grounds  had  no  merit  and  amounted  to  a
    disagreement with the outcome.

Error of Law Hearing

24.  At the start of the hearing Mr Eaton raised a  preliminary  issue.   He
    had been handed a  fax  of  a  letter  dated  22  June  2015  from  the
    respondent stating:

         "Please  find  attached  additional  objective  evidence  documents
         requested by the Immigration Judge post-hearing.

         A-C -  COI  response  dated  25  November  13  -  registration  and
         documentation

         D-E - COI response dated 20 February 14 - PTSD."

    Copies of those documents  were  attached  to  the  letter.   Mr  Eaton
    applied to amend his grounds of appeal by adding a further ground  that
    the FtT  erred  by  soliciting  additional  evidence  post-hearing  and
    further by providing no opportunity for the  appellant  to  respond  to
    additional evidence. The action of the FtT indicated  a  suggestion  of
    bias.  This was a Robinson obvious error of law point.

25.  Ms Sreeraman drew attention to a file note dated 15 June  2005  stating
    "IJ asked for further objective  evidence  relating  to  free  movement
    around China.  (HOPO to send China COIS within  the  next  few  days)".
    She confirmed that there was no information as  to  whether  the  FtT's
    request had been made in the presence of Mr Eaton or after the hearing.
     Mr Eaton confirmed that he was the appellants  representative  at  the
    First -tier hearing and that he had no recollection or note of  further
    objective evidence being requested by the FtT and in any event  he  had
    not been afforded  the opportunity to respond to  the  same  which  was
    clearly unfair.

Decision Re Preliminary Issue

26.  I granted leave for the grounds of appeal to be amended to  include  an
    additional ground that the FtT  erred  by  seeking  to  obtain  further
    objective evidence post hearing and without an opportunity  for  either
    party to respond.  It was not clear whether the FtT had in  fact  taken
    into account such evidence in reaching its decision.

Main Submissions

27.  Mr Eaton amplified the  arguments  set  out  in  the  five  grounds  of
    appeal.  As to ground 1 he submitted that the FtT failed to  take  into
    account the four  particular  pieces  of  written  evidence  that  were
    relevant to the credibility of the appellants' claim and there had been
    no reference or consideration of that evidence at all.  Furthermore  no
    reference was made to any of the written  or  oral  evidence  given  on
    behalf of the appellants.

28.  The second ground contended that the  FtT  failed  to  engage  properly
    with the whole issue of forced sterilisation which  was  a  persecutory
    act and there was ample background evidence to support the same.   That
    evidence established that the FtT was entirely wrong in concluding that
    there was no objective evidence to contradict the statements made [92].



29.  Ground 3 argued that the Tribunal had  reached  a  perverse  conclusion
    regarding  the  allegation  of  rape  without  any  reference  to   the
    psychologist's report.  It was clear that  the  Tribunal  fundamentally
    erred by deciding credibility in advance of  looking  at  the  expert's
    report.

30.  Ground 4 contended that  the  FtT  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    country  expert  report  at  all  and  the  reasons  given   were   not
    sustainable.

31.  Ground 5 related to findings of fact that  were  incorrect.   Mr  Eaton
    outlined the same.

32.  Ms Sreeraman relied on the  Rule  24  response.  She  argued  that  any
    errors were not material in light of the fact that internal flight  was
    a viable alternative.  Even if the appellant had  been  found  credible
    she would still have been  able  to  pursue  internal  relocation.   Ms
    Sreeraman acknowledged that the FtT had not in fact made any finding as
    regards internal flight alternative but argued that the  outcome  would
    have been the same.

33.  Mr Eaton responded by relying on the  appellants'  evidence  that  they
    had been on the run for a period of time, had been forced back to their
    home area because the family were only registered on the Jiangxi  hukou
    and they had been forced to return because the children  in  particular
    did not have access to any services including education.

34.  At the end of the  hearing  I  raised  with  both  representatives  the
    possible future disposal of the appeal in the event of  my  finding  an
    error of law. Both representatives agreed that the matter would need to
    be reheard in its entirety.



Discussion and Decision

35.  I have considered the submissions made by Mr Eaton and the response  by
    the Secretary of State set out in the Rule 24 response.  I am satisfied
    that the appellant has made out all  of  the  grounds  of  appeal.   In
    essence I am satisfied that the FtT erred materially in  assessing  the
    credibility of the appellant's account in isolation of  the  additional
    evidence that was before the FtT which included  documentary  evidence,
    oral  evidence  from  witnesses  and  background  and  expert  evidence
    produced in the appellants' bundle in particular that  in  relation  to
    the risk of forced sterilisation in the Jiangxi Province.  I  take  the
    view that the FtT's finding that it was not credible that the appellant
    was not prepared to undergo the required forced sterilisation was in my
    view indeed perverse and in light of the fact  that  in  AX  the  Upper
    Tribunal held forced sterilisation amounted to  persecutory  treatment.
    The fact that the first and second appellants  did  not  wish  to  have
    anymore children was not in my  view  determinative  of  the  issue  of
    forced sterilisation. I accepted the submission made by Mr  Eaton  that
    the FtT's reference to forced sterilisation as being "day surgery  with
    benefits" showed a fundamental failure by the FtT to engage objectively
    with the issue of forced sterilisation.  So too was the  FtT's  request
    to the respondent for further background material post hearing  capable
    of amounting an indicator of possible bias and thus unfairness  to  the
    appellant.

36.  Furthermore it is clear from the contents and indeed the layout of  the
    decision and reasons that the FtT approached the issue  of  credibility
    in isolation of the two expert reports and other evidence of relevance.
     The role of the FtT is to consider the appellants' claim in the  round
    in light of objective and  subjective  evidence  including  any  expert
    report and thereafter to reach an informed decision as  to  credibility
    having regard to whether the claim is both  internally  and  externally
    consistent.  The FtT found the appellant to have been dishonest and  as
    a consequence placed no weight on the expert reports of Dr Morrish  and
    Stephanie Gordon.  This approach amounts to a clear and material  error
    of law. Finally I am satisfied that ground 5 is made out and that there
    clear errors of fact (as detailed above) made  by  the  FtT  that  have
    impacted on the credibility findings.

37.  As regards the issue of internal flight I am of the view that it  would
    be unfair to the appellant for this issue to be raised  and  considered
    in isolation at this stage, particularly given that the FtT  failed  to
    specifically  make  findings  and  or  determine   this   issue.    The
    appellant's evidence was that the family went on the run for  a  period
    of years is material to relocation and is a matter  that  ought  to  be
    properly and fully ventilated before the Tribunal.

38.  At the end of the hearing I found that there were  material  errors  of
    law in the decision and accordingly I set it aside.  The nature of  the
    errors, which focused on the FtT's credibility findings, were such that
    none of the findings of fact could be preserved.



Notice of Decision

39.  The decision and reasons discloses material errors of law  and  is  set
    aside.

40.  The appeal is remitted to Hatton Cross  for  a  hearing  de  novo  (not
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Malins).  A date is to be fixed with a
    time estimate of three hours and four witnesses are to be called and an
    interpreter in the Mandarin language.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
