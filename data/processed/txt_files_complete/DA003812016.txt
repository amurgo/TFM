For the Respondent:    Mr Singh, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Poland.

 2. Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014

    The FTT made an anonymity order and there has been  no  application  by
    either party to discharge that order .Unless and until  a  Tribunal  or
    court directs otherwise, the Appellant is granted anonymity.  No report
    of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  him.  This
    direction applies both to the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure
    to  comply  with  this  direction  could  lead  to  contempt  of  court
    proceedings.

 3. The Appellant, with permission, appeals against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal, who in a determination  promulgated  on  the  15th
    March 2017 dismissed his appeal against the decision of  the  Secretary
    of State to make a deportation order against him under  the  provisions
    of Regulation 19(3)(b) and  Regulation  21  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 (hereinafter referred to as "the 2006 Regulations").

 4. The appellant claims that he first arrived in the United Kingdom on  26
    October 2003. However in later representations, he claimed that he  had
    arrived on 26 October 2002. He had stated that  he  had  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom 12 years. The appellant is a  Polish  national  but  had
    provided no evidence of leave to remain in the UK before Poland  joined
    the EU Member States on 1 May 2004. In June 2003 he  was  convicted  of
    attempting to travel without paying a rail fare  which  he  received  a
    fine of �30 and associated awards of compensation and costs.

 5. The appellant's history also demonstrates that he made  an  application
    for naturalisation as a British citizen which was refused on 29 October
    2015 and a reconsideration was refused on 14 June 2016.

 6. On 16 June 2014 he was convicted of  conspiracy  to  commit  fraud  and
    possessing, controlling a false,  improperly  obtained  false  identity
    document to which he was sentenced to 58  months  imprisonment  with  2
    months consecutive (total 60 months).

 7. As a consequence of that sentence of imprisonment,  the  Appellant  was
    notified of his liability to be deported on the 16th October  2015  and
    on 27 July 2016 the Secretary of State made a decision to  deport  him,
    having first taken into consideration the provisions of the Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 under Regulation 19(3)(b)  of
    the 2006 Regulations on account of his  conviction  on  the  16th  June
    2014. On the 29th April 2016 a confiscation order was made on  the  sum
    of �384,915.

 8. The relevant decision taken by the respondent  made  reference  to  his
    conviction in 2014 and that the Secretary of State had  considered  the
    offence for which he had been convicted and his conduct, in  accordance
    with Regulation 21 of the 2006 Regulations.

 9. As to his residence, the respondent did not accept that  the  appellant
    had been resident in the UK for a continuous period of  five  years  or
    more in accordance with the 2006 Regulations and that as  he  had  been
    serving a sentence of imprisonment that this would not count as  lawful
    residence in the UK. Whilst he had claimed to have lived in the  UK  12
    years, the respondent took the view that he did  not  qualify  for  the
    enhanced protection of Regulation 24 (1) relating to imperative grounds
    of public security because he had not acquired  a  permanent  right  to
    reside by virtue of residing in the United  Kingdom  for  a  continuous
    period  of  five  years  in  accordance  with  the   EEA   Regulations.
    Furthermore, it failed to demonstrate lawful residence 10  years  prior
    to his term of imprisonment.

10.  The decision set out that the Secretary of State was satisfied that he
    would pose a genuine, present and sufficiently threat to the  interests
    of public policy if he were to be  allowed  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that his deportation was justified under Regulation 21. The
    decision also made reference to Article 8 of the ECHR.

11. The full reasons for that decision are set  out  in  a  letter  of  the
    Respondent dated the 27th July 2016.

12.  The  Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The appeal came before the First-tier  Tribunal  on  the  8th
    March 2017.  In a determination promulgated on 15 March 2017 his appeal
    was dismissed. The judge made reference to whether there were  "serious
    grounds" and to whether "the appellant was a person  with  a  permanent
    right of residence under Regulation 15 of the  2006  Regulations"  (see
    paragraph 7). At paragraph 8, the judge made reference to the  evidence
    before him as to the appellant's employment. He found  that  there  was
    sporadic employment and claims of continuous employment but "that there
    was not the  evidence  in  any  reliable  form  to  show  that  he  was
    exercising treaty rights for the continuous period of five  years."  At
    paragraph 9 the judge stated that the appellant had not  lived  in  the
    United Kingdom 10 years prior to his term  of  imprisonment,  at  least
    lawfully resident in the United Kingdom in that period."  He  therefore
    found that the appellant did not fall to be considered under imperative
    grounds for removal by reference to Regulation 21 (four)  of  the  2006
    Regulations. He recorded that the continuous period of 10  years  prior
    to the relevant removal decision needed to be lawful and was not on the
    evidence what occurred (see paragraph 10). However the  judge  did  not
    make any reference to any relevant case law nor  did  he  set  out  the
    evidence upon which he had reached that conclusion.

13. The judge  then  went  on  to  consider  Regulation  21  (5)  the  2006
    Regulations and found that the decision to  remove  complied  with  the
    principle of proportionality and  whether  the  appellant  continue  to
    present a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting
    one of the fundamental interests of society. He did not find  that  the
    appellant had "rehabilitated" his behaviour nor that it was an  ongoing
    process in the UK.

14. At paragraph 17 the judge concluded as follows; "for my own part, I  am
    satisfied and find that the appellant has been  shown  to  be  properly
    engaged with Regulation 21 of the 2006 Regulations and  accordingly  he
    should be deported." It  is  not  clear,  in  my  judgement  what  that
    paragraph meant.

15. At paragraphs 18 -24 the judge went on to consider Article  8  and  the
    appellant's relationship with his partner and minor  child.  Whilst  he
    concluded that the appellant had  a  private  and  family  life  United
    Kingdom, he found the  circumstances  of  the  appellant's  criminality
    demonstrated amply  why  deportation  would  not  breach  rights  under
    Article 8 of the ECHR he therefore dismissed the appeal.

16. The appellant sought permission to appeal that decision and on 12  June
    2017 First-tier Tribunal judge Kelly granted permission.

17. Thus the appeal came before the Upper Tribunal. Mr Jasiri, who did  not
    represent the appellant before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  appeared  on
    behalf of the appellant. Mr Singh appeared on behalf of the respondent.
    The written grounds at ground one  assert  that  the  judge  failed  to
    consider the 2006 Regulations provided for three different standards of
    removal; the three different categories of residence of EEA  nationals.
    At paragraph 7 of the grounds, it was said that the judge erred in  law
    by focusing his attention on  lawful  residence/exercising  EEA  treaty
    rights in his consideration of the appeal. The grounds noted  paragraph
    10 of the determination  which  the  judge  stated  "I  find  that  the
    continuous period of residence the  10  years  prior  to  the  relevant
    removal decision needs to be lawful and was not on  the  evidence  what
    occurred." Thus the grounds state that it is not a requirement  of  the
    Regulations of the 10 years  residence  be  "lawful"  rather  that  the
    Regulations provide that the residents must be "continuous".

18. The grounds also assert that the judge  erred  in  law  by  discounting
    periods of imprisonment. At paragraph 8 of the grounds it is stated the
    term of imprisonment is only discounted  when  dealing  with  permanent
    residence under Regulation 15 and that Regulation 21 (4) (a)  does  not
    discount periods of imprisonment. The grounds cite a  decision  of  the
    Tribunal in Essa (EEA; rehabilitation/integration)  [2013]  UKUT  00316
    which in turn made reference to the decision in Tsakouridis.

19. Ground two related to the failure to consider  Article  8  and  section
    117C the 2002 adequately. In particular  paragraph  13,  there  was  no
    reference in the determination  to  the  oral  evidence  given  by  the
    appellant's partner.

20. Whilst the written grounds made reference to the issue of the  enhanced
    protection and whether it was a requirement for 10 years  residence  to
    be "lawful" and whether term  of  imprisonment  should  be  discounted,
    there had been no reference to the relevant and more recent case law in
    this area since the decision of Essa. In particular the decision of the
    Court of Justice of the European Communities in Case C-400/12 Secretary
    of State v MG or the decision of the in MG (prison - Article 28(3)  (a)
    of Citizens Directive) Portugal [2014] UKUT 00392, the decision of  the
    Court of Appeal in Warsame [2016] EWCA Civ 16  and  the  Supreme  Court
    decision in in Secretary of State for  the  home  Department  v  Franco
    Vomero [2016] UKSC 49.  There  was  also  no  reference  to  any  legal
    principles arising from the jurisprudence in the determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

21. Whilst the determination made reference to a skeleton argument provided
    by Counsel, (referred to in the determination at paragraphs 10 and  25)
    this was not in the papers of either advocate nor in the Tribunal file.
    It was therefore not possible to know basis upon  which  the  case  was
    advanced on behalf of the appellant beyond that in  the  determination,
    which was unclear. Mr Jasiri informed me that  the  appellant  had  now
    changed  his  solicitors  and  that  he  did  not  have  all   of   the
    documentation which included the skeleton argument. He therefore  could
    not assist as to what legal principles or case law had been provided to
    the judge. Mr Singh, having considered his file, could not find a  copy
    of the skeleton argument and could not shed any light on what had  been
    argued by the advocates.

22. Mr Jasiri re-formulated the written grounds in his oral submissions and
    in  particular  made  reference  to  the  issue  of   the   appellant's
    imprisonment. He submitted that the judge should not  have  necessarily
    discounted the period of imprisonment  when  considering  the  10  year
    period without more. He said the judge had not formed  any  distinction
    and had given no reasons in the determination for reaching that view.

23. There was some discussion between the advocates and the Tribunal as  to
    the exact dates of the appellant's time in custody.  The  trial  record
    sheet at (B1-B3) made reference to the proceedings in  the  magistrates
    court and also made reference to the appellant being in  custody  prior
    to conviction in  June  2014  but  it  was  not  ascertained  with  any
    certainty the exact period of when his detention  began.  It  was  also
    unclear on the evidence when the offending conduct began and over  what
    time period. There was no copy of the indictment in the papers and  the
    sentencing remarks do not set out the timescale. As will become  clear,
    that evidence is of importance when considering the issue  of  enhanced
    protection under the 2006 Regulations.

24. Mr Jasiri submitted that time in  custody  did  not  necessarily  break
    continuity of residents and that the judge was required to  count  back
    from the date of the decision to deport. In  this  respect  the  judges
    reasoning which was set out at paragraph 9 did not consider this issue.
    The timeframe is not provided nor is there any analysis  or  assessment
    of the issue. He also made reference to the fact that the appellant and
    his partner gave oral evidence before first-tier Tribunal  which  would
    have been relevant to the issue under the Regulations as well as  under
    Article 8 but that was not reflected in the determination  and  it  was
    not possible to know how the judge  considered  that  evidence.  As  to
    ground 2, it challenges the judges' analysis and that the judge  failed
    to engage with the evidence at paragraph 12.

25. Mr Singh on behalf of the Secretary of State  relied  on  the  rule  24
    response which set out that  the  judge  was  entitled  to  reject  the
    submission that the appellant had  not  demonstrated  10  years  lawful
    residence in accordance with the Regulations.  The  reply  goes  on  to
    state that the judge "finds the appellant cannot establish  five  years
    lawful residency exercising  treaty  rights."  As  to  Article  8,  the
    appellant been convicted of large-scale fraud  which  he  continued  to
    deny and that the judge took into account the family circumstances  and
    that they could relocate to Poland  or  choose  to  remain  in  the  UK
    without the appellant.

26. He could not assist the Tribunal as to how the case had  been  advanced
    before the First-tier Tribunal in particular what legal principles  had
    been relied upon. He did, however, in his submissions make reference to
    the Tribunal's decision in  MG  (as  cited)  and  the  Supreme  Court's
    decision in Vomero. He submitted that  the  appellant  must  meet  five
    years lawful residence before he could be considered under the 10  year
    route therefore the judge was not wrong in reaching that conclusion. He
    submitted that have been the Secretary of  State  argument  in  Vomero.
    However he recognised that there was a contrary view  at  paragraph  26
    and that the court made a reference to the  Court  of  Justice  in  the
    terms as set out at paragraphs 27 and 28.

27. As to the issue of imprisonment  and  the  effect  upon  the  level  of
    protection, he could not give any further detail as to the  exact  time
    the appellant was in custody other than the information I have referred
    to  above.  He  submitted  that  the  appellant  was  not  sufficiently
    integrated in the UK society as a result of his offending therefore the
    period should be discounted when reaching a  decision  on  whether  the
    enhanced protection was available to the appellant. He  submitted  that
    whilst the judge did not refer to any of  the  case  law,  his  general
    findings can be ascertained from the determination that  this  was  the
    route that he went along. Thus he invited me to  reach  the  conclusion
    that the decision should stand.

28. Mr Jasiri made reference to paragraphs 8 and 9 of the determination and
    that  the  judge  had  not  approach  the  question  of  the  level  of
    integration in the way suggested by the case law  and  that  they  have
    been a failure to engage in this.

29. I am satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve
    the making of an error on a point of law. I shall set  out  my  reasons
    for reaching that decision. The issue  arises  as  to  the  appellant's
    length of residence in the UK and what level of  protection  should  be
    applied to his case by the Secretary of State.  Whilst  the  judge  was
    aware of the appellant's claimed arrival in the UK and  the  length  of
    his residence, it is not possible from the determination to assess  how
    that  issue  was  determined  by  reference  to  the  applicable  legal
    principles. I would accept that it is not necessary to  set  out  large
    amounts of case law and recitals of legal principles  but  that  it  is
    sufficient for the decision to show how the legal principles  that  are
    relevant have been applied. There was a skeleton argument provided  but
    it is not been possible to ascertain its contents and there is no  real
    reference to the substance of that argument in the  determination.  The
    only paragraphs that deal with this issue are at paragraphs 7-9 whereby
    the judge found that he had not demonstrated that he  had  a  permanent
    right of residence for a period of five years (paragraph 8) and that he
    had not lived in the UK lawfully resident  prior  to  his  imprisonment
    (paragraph 9).

30. In Secretary of State for the Home Department v MG  (Case  no  c-400/12
    CJEU) (second chamber) it was held that unlike the requisite period for
    acquiring a right of permanent residence which began  when  the  person
    concerned commenced lawful residence in the post Member State,  the  10
    year period of residence  necessary  for  the  grant  of  the  enhanced
    protection provided for in Article 28(3)  (a)  must  be  calculated  by
    counting back from the date of  the  decision  ordering  that  person's
    expulsion. All relevant factors  should  be  taken  into  account  when
    considering the  calculation  of  the  10  year  period  including  the
    duration of each period of absence from  the  host  Member  State,  the
    cumulative  duration  and  the  frequency  of  absences.  A  period  of
    imprisonment  was  in  principle  capable  both  of  interrupting   the
    continuity of the period of  residence  needed  and  of  affecting  the
    decision regarding the grant  of  enhanced  protection  provided  there
    under, even where the person concerned had resided in the  host  member
    state for 10 years prior to imprisonment albeit that the fact that  the
    person had been in the member state 10 years prior to imprisonment  was
    a factor to be taken into account.

31. In MG (prison-Article 28(3)(a) of Citizens Directive)  Portugal  [2014]
    UKUT 392 it was held that (I) Article 28(3)(a) of Directive  2004/38/EC
    contained the requirement that for those who had resided  in  the  host
    member state for the previous 10  years,  an  expulsion  decision  made
    against them must be based upon imperative grounds of public  security;
    (ii) there was a tension in the judgment of the Court of Justice of the
    European Communities in Case  C-400/12  Secretary  of  State  v  MG  in
    respect of the meaning of  the  "enhanced  protection"  provision;  and
    (iii) the judgment should be understood as meaning  that  a  period  of
    imprisonment during those 10 years did not necessarily prevent a person
    from qualifying for enhanced protection if that person was sufficiently
    integrated. However, according  to  the  same  judgment,  a  period  of
    imprisonment must have a negative impact  in  so  far  as  establishing
    integration was concerned.

32. In the decision of Warsame [2016] EWCA Civ  16  it  was  held  that  in
    Secretary of State for the Home Department v  MG  (Portugal)  (Case  C-
    400/12) it was  established  that  the  ten-year  period  of  residence
    required to benefit from the enhanced protection of imperative  grounds
    must in principle be continuous and be calculated by counting back from
    the date of the deportation decision.  The  Court  of  Justice  of  the
    European  Union  ("CJEU")  found  that,  in   principle,   periods   of
    imprisonment interrupted the continuity of periods of residence for the
    purposes of granting the enhanced protection. However,  the  CJEU  also
    held that applicants could still qualify  for  enhanced  protection  if
    they could show that they had resided in the UK during  the  ten  years
    prior to imprisonment, but that depended on an  overall  assessment  of
    whether integrating links previously forged with the host Member  State
    had been broken.  On  the  facts,  because  of  an  earlier  period  of
    imprisonment which also broke continuity, this appellant was not one of
    those in the narrow  "maybe"  category  of  cases  contemplated  in  MG
    (Portugal) where a person has resided in the host state during the  ten
    years prior to imprisonment,  for  which  a  more  detailed  individual
    assessment of links to the host and home state would be required.

33.  The Court of Appeal appears to have accepted at [9] that  there  is  a
    "maybe" category of cases where a person has resided in the host  state
    for the  10  years  prior  to  imprisonment  depending  on  an  overall
    assessment of whether integrating links have been broken, and  that  in
    such cases it might be relevant to determine the degree of  integration
    in the host state and the extent  to  which  links  with  the  original
    member state have been broken.

34.  This issue therefore arises in this case as to whether  the  appellant
    falls into this "maybe" category. The exercise  required  the  counting
    back from the date of the deportation decision and assessing the extent
    of links forged in the UK and whether they had been broken.  Whilst  Mr
    Singh sought to argue that this was the approach the judge had adopted,
    I do not find  that  that  is  reflected  in  the  determination.  This
    arguably required a more detailed individual assessment of links to the
    host and home state. It cannot be ascertained  from  the  determination
    what conclusion he reached on this issue as there is no reference to it
    beyond reference to his employment. There was oral  evidence  given  by
    the appellant and his partner, who was a British Citizen, but  that  is
    not reflected in any findings relevant to the issue of integration. The
    judge did make reference to the appellant's serious  offending  carried
    out in the UK and this is relevant to the issue  of  integration  as  a
    person who is integrated will want to ensure he respects  the  laws  of
    the United Kingdom, which acts of criminality do not  demonstrate.  The
    question is whether the appellant was  sufficiently  integrated  taking
    his circumstances as a whole. Whilst a period of imprisonment may break
    continuity this cannot mean that an appellant loses the benefit of  any
    earlier integration.

35. I have therefore reached the conclusion that  there  the  has  been  no
    proper consideration of  the  level  of  protection  and  whether  this
    appellant is integrated into the United  Kingdom  and  if  so  to  what
    level, and the appropriate degree of  protection  available  for  which
    further detailed analysis and findings of fact are required.  Once  the
    appropriate level of protection has been properly identified it will be
    necessary to consider all other  relevant  factors  to  be  taken  into
    account when assessing an EEA deportation decision. As I have set  out,
    it is unclear as to the date when  the  appellant  first  entered  into
    custody and the period over which the  offending  conduct  was  carried
    out. That should be ascertained. The appellant's witness statement also
    makes reference to an  application  for  naturalisation  as  a  British
    citizen which was approved by the respondent on 6 January 2014 but that
    between the issuing of the approval  decision  and  the  naturalisation
    ceremony, the  appellant  was  arrested  and  then  convicted  for  the
    criminal offending to which he was sentenced to  a  substantial  prison
    term. There is no  information  from  the  respondent  concerning  that
    issue. That information should be provided before the First Tribunal.

36. I need not reach any conclusion on the Article 8 analysis having  found
    and error of law in the determination.

37. Therefore for those reasons the decision cannot stand and will  be  set
    aside. I consider that the correct course to adopt in a  case  of  this
    nature would be for  the  appeal  to  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal because it would enable the judge to consider the  Appellant's
    evidence and that of his partner alongside the documentary evidence and
    to reach the necessary findings of fact.

38. Thus the appeal will be remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  who  will
    consider the matter afresh.

    Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law. It is set aside and it is remitted to the First-tier
    Tribunal to be remade.



    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
