Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R de Mello, instructed by Veja & Co, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Amin) allowing an  appeal  by  Hafiz  Rizwan
    against a decision dated 6 February 2014 refusing him a residence  card
    as confirmation of a right to reside in the United  Kingdom.   In  this
    decision I refer to the parties as  they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, Mr Rizwan as the appellant and the Secretary of State as  the
    respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 1 May 1988.  He  applied
    for a residence card on 6 December 2013 as confirmation of a  right  to
    reside in the UK.  He claimed to be a family member of  his  sister-in-
    law Paula Machado, the wife of his brother Muhammad  Saleem.   However,
    the respondent was not satisfied that  the  appellant  could  meet  the
    requirements of reg. 8 of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 ("the EEA Regulations") as he  had  not  provided  any
    evidence of his dependency  on  his  EEA  national  sponsor  either  in
    Pakistan or in the United Kingdom, that he had been  dependent  on  his
    sponsor immediately prior to entering  the  UK  or  that  he  had  been
    residing with or dependent on  her  since  entering  the  UK.   In  the
    circumstances he failed to meet the requirements of reg. 8(2).

The Hearing Before the First-tier Tribunal

3.   At the hearing before the judge, the appellant, his brother and sister-
    in-law gave oral evidence.  The judge found that  all  three  witnesses
    were entirely credible and consistent in their evidence  which  can  be
    briefly be summarised as follows.  The appellant had been residing with
    his brother in Pakistan.  Before coming to the UK he had been a student
    in Pakistan and his college fees were paid by his brother.  His brother
    had lived with the family  until  he  came  to  the  UK  following  his
    marriage on 23 March 2010 and the grant of  a  residence  card  from  7
    October 2010 to 7 October 2015.

4.   The appellant arrived in the UK as a student on 7 October 2010 and  was
    granted leave to  remain  until  11  February  2012,  his  leave  being
    extended to 30 August 2013.  Since being in the UK he has lived in  the
    same household as his brother and sister-in-law  and  his  brother  has
    continued to support him in his studies  and  provide  maintenance  and
    accommodation in the UK.

5.   The judge  accepted  that  there  had  been  prior  dependency  by  the
    appellant on his brother [46]  and  that  had  not  changed  after  his
    brother had married.  The judge commented it was natural for couples to
    deal with finances jointly as  in  the  present  case  following  their
    marriage and the fact the money had been sent to the appellant  from  a
    joint account did not mean  that  the  appellant  could  not  establish
    dependency [49].  The judge also  found  that  the  appellant  and  his
    brother had been members of the same household in Pakistan  before  his
    brother came to the UK and since he arrived in the UK, he  has  been  a
    member of his  brother's  household  and  was  supported  by  him  both
    financially and emotionally.  The  judge,  therefore,  found  that  the
    requirements of reg 8(2) were met and the appeal  was  allowed  to  the
    extent that the matter was remitted back to the respondent to  consider
    under reg.  17(4)  whether  the  appellant  should  be  issued  with  a
    residence card [53].

Grounds and Submissions

6.   The grounds of appeal in substance raise three issues.  Firstly, it  is
    argued that whilst the appellant and his brother may have  been  living
    in the same household in the  past,  there  was  no  finding  that  the
    sponsor had EEA status at that time and it could not therefore be shown
    that they were members of the same household for the  purposes  of  the
    EEA Regulations.  Secondly, it is argued that in  the  absence  of  any
    adequate documentary evidence the judge failed to explain how financial
    dependency was established and thirdly, if in fact money  was  sent  to
    the appellant in Pakistan it did not constitute dependency  as  it  was
    said that this was only to support the appellant's education  and  that
    the family had other means to support themselves in Pakistan.

7.   Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "2.  The application for permission  to  appeal  asserts  that  the
         decision breaches the guidance of  Moneke  [2011]  UKUT  341  which
         requires an EEA extended family member  claimant  to  have  been  a
         dependant in the household of the EEA  sponsor  at  the  time  that
         sponsor themselves had EEA citizenship which was  lacking  in  this
         case.

         3.   Taking a holistic view of the evidence in the round ... I find
         that there was prior dependency on the brother' (ï¿½48). There is  no
         finding of the  sponsoring  brother  himself  having  achieved  EEA
         citizenship at the time of the dependency found by the F-tTJ which,
         therefore and in accordance with the Moneke, amounts to an arguable
         error of law."

8    Mr Whitwell adopted his grounds.  In respect of  the  first  ground  he
    argued that the finding at [30] showed that the dependency in  Pakistan
    arising from money remitted there had been prior to his  brother  being
    able to bring himself within the EEA Regulations.   Secondly,  a  large
    bundle of documents had been produced in  evidence  but  there  was  no
    adequate documentary evidence to support the oral evidence about  prior
    dependency.  Finally, he argued that the finding of dependency was  not
    open to the judge in  circumstances  where  it  was  clear  that  prior
    dependency had been simply to support the appellant's education.

9.   Mr de Mello referred to and relied on Home Secretary  v  Rahman  [2012]
    EUECJ C83/11 at [33]-[35] which confirmed that when an  application  as
    an extended family member was based on dependency, an applicant did not
    need show that the dependency existed at a time when both  he  and  his
    EEA national sponsor lived together in the same country.

10.  He submitted that the judge had  made  clear  findings  on  this  issue
    which were properly open to her.  She had accepted that  the  appellant
    and his brother had lived in the same household and after  the  brother
    came to the UK he had continued to provide financial support, the judge
    accepting that the money sent  to  the  appellant  came  from  a  joint
    account. Mr De Mello did not accept that the  grant  of  permission  to
    appeal extended to the second and third grounds as it  focussed  solely
    on the first ground. Without prejudice to that  submission,  he  argued
    that so far as the finding of dependency was concerned, the  judge  had
    properly directed herself taking into account the decision of the Upper
    Tribunal in Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 314.



Assessment of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

11.  The issue before me is whether the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  law
    such that the decision should be set aside.  The first ground seeks  to
    argue that the dependency relied on in Pakistan was at a time when  the
    sponsor did not have EEA status.  When granting  permission  to  appeal
    the First-tier Tribunal said that it was arguable  that  there  was  an
    error of law as there was no finding that the  sponsoring  brother  had
    himself achieved EEA citizenship by the time of the dependency found by
    the judge. However, whether the sponsoring  brother  had  acquired  EEA
    citizenship is not an issue in the context of this appeal.

12.  The requirement in reg. 8(2)(a) is that the appellant has to show  that
    he is the relative of an EEA national, his spouse or his civil  partner
    residing in a country other than the UK and is  dependent  on  the  EEA
    national or is a member of their household.   The  appellant's  brother
    became the spouse of an EEA national on 23 March 2010.  No issue arises
    of him having to achieve EEA citizenship as opposed to EEA status  and,
    indeed, it was accepted that the appellant's brother is and was at  all
    material times a citizen of Pakistan.

13.  The judge accepted that after the marriage of his  brother  and  before
    he arrived in the UK, the  appellant  continued  to  receive  financial
    support from his brother [46].  She then said that  taking  a  holistic
    view of the evidence in the  round  and  notwithstanding  the  lack  of
    documentary evidence, she found that there was prior dependency by  the
    appellant on his brother [48].  These findings  must  be  read  in  the
    light of what the judge went on to say in [49]:

         "49  I also find that there was no change in the  dependency  after
         the appellant's brother was married. It is also natural for couples
         to deal with their finances jointly as in  this  case  following  a
         marriage. The fact that the money was sent to the appellant from  a
         joint account does not mean that  the  appellant  cannot  establish
         dependency."

14.  Although at points in the determination of the judge  referred  to  the
    appellant being dependent upon his brother, as indeed he was  prior  to
    the marriage, the issue was whether the appellant was able to establish
    dependency on an EEA national in  accordance  with  reg  8(2).  In  his
    application the appellant  identified  his  sister-in-law  as  his  EEA
    national family member and there is no reason to believe that the judge
    was not fully aware of this: see in particular [2], [3]  and  [29]-[31]
    of the decision. She accepted that the appellant's dependency continued
    after his brother's marriage but it was now met by remittances  from  a
    joint account. The comment that the fact that the money was sent from a
    joint account did not mean  that  the  appellant  could  not  establish
    dependency indicates to me in the context of the  facts  in  this  case
    that the judge  was  finding  that  the  appellant  had  established  a
    dependency not only on his brother but also on  his  sister-in-law  for
    the period after his brother's marriage on 23  March  2010  up  to  his
    arrival in the UK on 7 October 2010 so meeting the requirements set out
    in Rahman.

15.  The judge went on to find that the  appellant  became  and  remained  a
    member of his brother and sister-in-law's household after he arrived in
    the UK on 7 October 2010 and had continued to receive financial support
    [52]. Therefore,  although  the  judge  refers  to  dependency  on  the
    applicant's brother, in the light of her findings of  fact,  there  was
    after the marriage a dependency on his brother and his sister  in  law,
    the EEA national.  No issue therefore arose of the appellant having  to
    establish as part of his claim that  his  brother  had  become  an  EEA
    national.

16.  I now turn to the second and third grounds.  I do not  read  the  grant
    of permission  as  extending  to  these  grounds.   The  judge  clearly
    focussed on the status of the sponsor and there is no reference to  the
    issues  seeking  to  challenge  the  judge's  findings   on   financial
    dependency  or  any  indication  that  he  regarded  those  matters  as
    arguable.

17.  If I am wrong about  that,  I  am  not  satisfied  that  there  is  any
    substance in these grounds.  The decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Reyes gives guidance on the assessment of dependency as do the  current
    UKBA ECIs at Ch 5.12.  I am not satisfied that there is anything in the
    judge's decision to indicate that she  erred  in  her  approach  to  or
    assessment of whether the appellant  could  properly  be  described  as
    dependent on his brother and sister-in-law.

18.  It was argued that there should have been more documentary evidence  to
    support certain aspects of the oral evidence but in the  light  of  the
    judge's findings of credibility on the oral  evidence  [46]  I  am  not
    satisfied that it is arguable that the  judge  erred  in  law  in  this
    respect.  Similarly, the fact that the financial  support  particularly
    in Pakistan was primarily to provide for the appellant's education does
    not in itself undermine the judge's  assessment  that  it  amounted  to
    dependency.  This was an issue of fact for the judge to assess  in  the
    light of the evidence as a whole and I am satisfied that  the  decision
    she reached was properly open to her for the reasons she gave.

19.  In summary, I am not satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in
    law.

Decision

20.  The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law and the  decision  that  the
    appeal be remitted to the respondent to consider whether the  appellant
    should be issued with a residence card stands. No anonymity  order  was
    made by the First-tier Tribunal and no application was made for one  at
    this hearing. .
