                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   These linked appeals have come back before me to  remake  the  decision
    following my decision that First-tier Tribunal Judge Hunter  had  erred
    in law in allowing the appeals in his decision promulgated on  9  March
    2015.

2.   Although before me the Secretary of  State  is  the  Appellant  and  Mr
    Singh and Ms Kaur are the Respondents, for the sake of consistency with
    the proceedings before the First-tier Tribunal I shall hereafter  refer
    to Mr Singh and Ms Kaur as the Appellants and the Secretary of State as
    the Respondent.


Background

3.   I have previously rehearsed the background  to  these  appeals  in  the
    'Error of Law' decision made following  the  hearing  on  15  September
    2015. For ease of reference I repeat the germane paragraphs here:

    "The Appellants are nationals of India born on 16 February 1942 and  10
    July 1944 respectively.  They last entered the  United  Kingdom  on  25
    June 2013 pursuant to entry clearance as family  visitors.   They  have
    resided with their eldest son, Mr Jasvir Singh Matharu (the 'sponsor'),
    ever since.  They have previously made visits to the United Kingdom and
    have themselves been visited in India by  both  their  eldest  son  and
    their second son who also resides in the United Kingdom.

    I pause to note that the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that when  the
    Appellants last entered the UK they came as genuine visitors, and  have
    not sought to disregard the Immigration Rules.   However,  their  plans
    changed because of a change of circumstances (see  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision at paragraph 60).   Mr  Jarvis  [the  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer] before me acknowledges the soundness of that conclusion.

     The change  of  circumstances  relates  to  the  health  of  the  First
    Appellant.  On 28 August 2013 he was admitted to Charing Cross Hospital
    after having had a stroke.  It is to  be  noted  that  he  also  has  a
    history of asthma and respiratory problems following the removal  of  a
    lung.  He has also suffered from bouts of pneumonia  whilst  living  in
    the United Kingdom and a mild cardiac  attack.   It  was  against  this
    background that applications were made for variation of leave to remain
    as the adult dependent relatives of the sponsor.

     The Respondent refused such applications on 2 May 2014 for reasons  set
    out in a 'reasons for refusal'  letter  of  that  date.   Decisions  to
    remove the Appellants further to section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006 were also made."

4.   The focus of the Appellants' cases before the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    essentially  the  submission  that   the   Appellants   satisfied   the
    requirements under Appendix FM of adult dependent  relatives  save  for
    the fact that the Immigration Rules did not permit switching into  that
    category whilst in the United Kingdom; further it  was  submitted  that
    there were good reasons for granting leave  outside  the  Rules,  there
    being compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules, in particular with regard to  the  First  Appellant's  state  of
    health. At the 'error of law' hearing  I  concluded  that  the  Judge's
    favourable findings in respect of paragraph E-ECDR.2.5 were in error as
    he had failed to have regard to the evidential requirements  under  the
    Rules pursuant to Appendix FM-SE, in particular paragraphs 34  and  35;
    such an error was material  because  it  had  informed  the  Article  8
    assessment outside the Rules.

5.   At the 'error of law' hearing new evidence was presented in respect  of
    the  deteriorating  health  condition  of  the  First  Appellant.   The
    Respondent's representative on that occasion  indicated  that  in  such
    circumstances the Secretary of State would like to re-assess  the  case
    in light of the evidence before  proceeding  to  a  re-hearing  of  the
    appeal; the appeal was adjourned accordingly.  In the event, as  I  was
    informed by Ms Brockleby-Weller, the Respondent has  not  reviewed  the
    case: nonetheless Ms  Brockleby-Weller  invited  the  Tribunal  now  to
    proceed with re-making the appeal without a further adjournment.

Re-making the decisions in the appeals

5.   The Appellants' cases are now advanced on essentially  the  same  basis
    as previously, but rely on further evidence.

6.   The error of law decision  did  not  disturb  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge's findings of primary fact. Further Ms Brockleby-Weller indicated
    that she did not  have  any  questions  for  the  Appellants  or  their
    supporting family member witnesses. Both representatives  were  content
    to proceed on the basis of submissions.

7.   Ms Iqbal accepts that  the  Appellants  cannot  qualify  for  leave  to
    remain under the Rules because they did not  have  entry  clearance  as
    'adult dependent relatives': see paragraphs E-ILRDR.1.2 and D-ILRDR.1.4
    of Appendix FM. Accordingly reliance is placed on  Article  8.  It  was
    common ground in this regard that the only  issue  was  in  respect  of
    'proportionality' - the parties were in agreement that  the  first  two
    Razgar questions should be answered in the Appellants' favour and there
    was no issue in respect of the third and fourth Razgar questions, (e.g.
    see decision of First-tier Tribunal, paragraphs 38-45).

8.   The Appellants also persist in the submission that save for the  'prior
    entry clearance' requirement they meet the terms of the adult dependent
    relative Rules, and to that end in any proportionality assessment their
    circumstances are essentially permissible under the Rules and therefore
    their removal is not justifiable by  reference  to  the  imperative  of
    maintaining  effective  immigration  control  -  it   being   otherwise
    contended that it would  be  unreasonable  and  unrealistic  to  expect
    persons with such infirmities to quit  the  UK  temporarily  merely  to
    apply to return.

9.   In this context I remind myself again of the requirements of  paragraph
    E-ECDR.2.5:

         "The applicant or, if the  applicant  and  their  partner  are  the
         sponsor's parents or grandparents, the applicant's partner, must be
         unable, even with the practical and financial help of the  sponsor,
         to obtain the required level of care in the country where they  are
         living because:


         (a)  it is not available and there is no person in that country who
             can reasonably provide it; or


         (b)  it is not affordable."


10.  I also note the evidential requirements  pursuant  to  Appendix  FM-SE,
    paragraphs 34 and 35:

         "34. Evidence that, as a result of age, illness or disability,  the
             applicant requires long-term personal  care  should  take  the
             form of:


             (a)   Independent  medical  evidence  that   the   applicant's
                  physical  or  mental  condition  means  that  they  cannot
                  perform everyday tasks; and


             (b)  This must be from a doctor or other health professional.


         35.  Independent evidence that the applicant is unable,  even  with
             the practical and financial help of the sponsor in the UK,  to
             obtain the required level of care in the  country  where  they
             are living should be from:


             (a)  a central or local health authority;


             (b)  a local authority; or


             (c)  a doctor or other health professional."


11.  I pause to emphasise that the focus of these  provisions  is  on  'long
    term personal care', rather than medical treatment, albeit the need for
    personal care might arise due to illness. Paragraph 34(a) is indicative
    of the concept of 'personal care' being related to the  performance  of
    everyday tasks.

12.  The Respondent has not,  before  me,  sought  to  re-open  any  of  the
    findings of primary fact of the First-tier Tribunal, and has not sought
    to challenge the veracity and reliability of the more recent supporting
    medical evidence. Bearing this in  mind,  and  drawing  from  both  the
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal and all of the  available  evidence
    on file, I consider the issues in the appeals against the background of
    the following facts in respect  of  the  Appellants'  health  and  care
    needs.

13.  The First Appellant: Mr Mohninder Singh.

    (i) Mr Singh was born on 16 February 1941, and so at the  date  of  the
    hearing was 74 years old.

    (ii) He has a history  of  TB,  which  was  treated  by  a  right  lung
    lobectomy (removal of a lobe of the lung). He  is  asthmatic  and  also
    prone to recurrent chest infections.  He  has  attended  hospital  with
    episodes of pneumonia in April 2014 and June 2014 (when he was admitted
    in relation to a heart attack); there was a further admission  from  22
    August 2014 to  26  August  2014  with  haemoptysis  and  asthma.  More
    recently, shortly before the error of law hearing, the First  Appellant
    was admitted to hospital from 12  August  2015  and  discharged  on  21
    August 2015 suffering from pneumonia. A a few hours after his admission
    on this occasion he  went  into  PEA  (pulseless  electrical  activity)
    arrest  (i.e.  cardiac  arrest)  secondary  to  hypoxia,  and  required
    resuscitation. He has been diagnosed with bronchiectasis in both  lungs
    which makes him vulnerable to recurrent chest infections.


    (iii) On 28 August 2013 he had a stroke  (basal  ganglia  bleed)  which
    left him with a feeling of numbness  on  his  left  side  limiting  his
    mobility (see his GP Dr Sekhon's letter, 25 November 2013).  Whilst,  I
    note that in the letter dated 15 April 2014 from Dr Sekhon it was  said
    that the First Appellant had made a full recovery from stroke  and  did
    not have any residual neurological deficits, and that this was repeated
    in a letter dated 30 April 2014, it is also the  case  that  Dr  Sekhon
    comments upon the Appellant having problems with his memory and  speech
    since his stroke, and  the  family  commenting  on  short  term  memory
    deterioration. This has been  followed  up,  and  an  assessment  by  a
    consultant psychiatrist (referenced in a letter from Dr Sekhon dated 29
    December 2014) suggested a degree of brain  damage  following  cerebral
    haemorrhage, and evidence of vascular dementia. Dr Sekhon opines "it is
    likely that his vascular  dementia  will  progress  and  that  he  will
    continue to have cognitive decline".


    (iv) In this context I note that there  are  two  reports  on  file  by
    Consultant Psychiatrist Dr Gilbert Andrews, dated 3 June  2014  and  29
    December 2014. In the first report Dr Andrews identifies a risk of self-
    neglect, and refers to a need for assistance with activities  of  daily
    living,  specifically:  washing   and   dressing;   personal   hygiene;
    supervision  whilst  feeding  to   avoid   choking;   supervision   and
    encouragement to ensure an adequate fluid and food  intake;  assistance
    with medication; assistance with travel. It is also said that the First
    Appellant is forgetful and can become distressed, for example  when  he
    misplaces personal belongings. He  also  becomes  agitated  easily  and
    requires reassurance; he often asks for his son when his son is out  at
    work; he is emotionally fragile, yet resents his dependence  on  others
    which can cause him to become tearful. Dr Andrews also opined that  the
    First Appellant lacked capacity to plan and decide on matters of health
    and finance. The second report indicated a "clear impression that there
    was  further  deterioration"  noting  that  this  was  to  be  expected
    following the myocardial infarction of June 2014.

    (v) There is a history of hypertension. In June 2014 the Appellant  had
    a myocardial infarction (heart  attack),  and  a  subsequent  angiogram
    resulted in a diagnosis of severe  coronary  heart  disease  (3  vessel
    disease).

    (vi) The First Appellant has  an  enlarged  prostate.  He  has  had  an
    episode of diuresis and made use of catheters. There have been episodes
    of incontinence.

    (vii) Other diagnoses include cataracts, iron deficiency, and anaemia.

    (viii) His son, Jasvir Matharu helps with personal care such as helping
    him to shower, helping him use the toilet,  giving  him  massages,  and
    helping  him  to  dress.  His  daughter-in-law  ensures  he  takes  his
    medication on time, and prepares meals for him.

14.  In summary I  conclude  that  the  First  Appellant  has  deteriorating
    vascular dementia and is in cognitive decline,  suffering  from  short-
    term memory loss and forgetfulness; he is emotionally fragile; he  also
    suffers from heart disease and bronchiectasis and asthma  which  limits
    his mobility because of shortness of breath; he is also extremely prone
    to recurrent chest infections which are significantly debilitating  and
    have habitually required hospitalisation  for  treatment.  He  requires
    assistance with most basic activities of daily living. His wife is  not
    able to provide the level of assistance required (see  further  below).
    He is not able to make plans for himself in respect of  his  healthcare
    or his finances. The Appellant's care needs are  more  than  adequately
    met by his son and daughter-in-law, who are also able  to  assist  with
    his emotional fragility.

15.  The Second Appellant Ms Surinder Kaur

    (i) Ms Kaur was born on 10 July 1944, and so at the date of the hearing
    was 71 years old.


    (ii) She has been diagnosed  with  diabetes  (Type  II),  hypertension,
    hypercholesterolaemia, panic attacks, and visual problems.


    (iii) Her GP, Dr Sekhon, observed in a letter dated 20  May  2014  that
    there were concerns over the Second Appellant's control of her diabetes
    that might be attributable to stress  and  anxiety  -  "the  stress  of
    looking after her husband has resulted in a deterioration  in  her  own
    medical problems and I saw her on 17 May 2014 when recent  blood  tests
    had shown poor diabetic control". In  the  same  letter  Doctor  Sekhon
    expressed the opinion in respect of both  Appellants  that  "return  to
    India would  have  a  severe  detrimental  effect  on  their  physical,
    emotional and psychological well-being", and has repeated this  opinion
    in subsequent letters.

    (iv) In addition to the emotional impact on the Second Appellant, there
    are concerns over her practical ability to meet the care needs  of  her
    husband - see in this context letter from Dr Sekhon dated  29  December
    2014 - "I think it will put increasing strain  on  Mrs  Singh  to  look
    after her husband in the future. This will naturally impact on her well-
    being and possibly cause a deterioration in her health". The First-tier
    Tribunal Judge found that it was not "a practical proposition to expect
    the second Appellant to be able to provide the necessary care  for  her
    husband in India" (paragraph 50).


    (v) The Second Appellant receives assistance from her son and daughter-
    in-law to dress, and also has her meals prepared for her.


16.  The Appellant's two sons live in the UK; their two  daughters  live  in
    India. Both daughters are married and have their own children, and both
    daughters - in accordance with custom - are responsible for caring  for
    their own in-laws who are also said to be elderly and needing  constant
    care and attention. One daughter lived approximately  370km  away  from
    the Appellants in India, and the other, whilst living  closer  at  30km
    distance, had her own health problems (See in  this  context  also  the
    observation at paragraph 52 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal,
    also quoting from the Respondent's IDIs on  adult  dependent  relatives
    which remind decision-makers that relevant cultural factors  should  be
    borne in mind, "such as in countries where women  are  unlikely  to  be
    able to provide support".)

17.  I accept that it  follows  from  the  above  that  if  the  Appellant's
    personal care needs are to be met in India, this will be by some third-
    party outside agency.

18.  In an attempt to meet the evidential requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  -
    the Rules being pleaded in aid as part of  the  Article  8  assessment,
    rather than being expressly relied  upon  in  absence  of  prior  entry
    clearance as adult dependent relatives - the  Appellants  rely  upon  a
    letter signed by Dr Vikas Patil of the  Wadhwa  Hospital  in  Jalandhar
    district dated 7 October 2015.

19.  Dr Patil provides a summary of his  understanding  of  the  Appellant's
    case, and refers to having had sight of some of the documents that  are
    before me in relation to the Appellant's conditions  and  treatment  in
    the UK. He then says "I can confirm although the medical  treatment  he
    requires  is  available  in  India  there  are  a  considerable  amount
    difficulties and obstacles Mr Singh will have to face if he  is  to  be
    returned to India". Thereafter  the  letter  emphasises  the  practical
    difficulties in reaching a hospital, and emphasises the fact of the PEA
    arrest and that the outcome might have  been  fatal  had  it  not  been
    possible for the Appellant  to  receive  immediate  remedial  treatment
    because he was already at a hospital: "In my opinion  Mr  Singh  is  to
    have an episode where he need immediate attention the practical  issues
    which I've highlighted above would not permit him to get to a  hospital
    which will be able to assist his condition". In purported answer to the
    specific issue of the ability to obtain "the level of care  in  India",
    Dr  Patil  refers  to  the  medical  treatment  that  the   Appellant's
    underlying medical conditions might require - the giving of oxygen  and
    antibiotics, and the provision of a Medicare team  to  give  first  aid
    until an ambulance service arrives.

20.  In my judgement this evidence does not address the requirements of  the
    Rules which is in respect of the provision of personal care to  perform
    everyday tasks, rather than the availability of medical care  to  treat
    any particular underlying medical condition, or manage any episodes  of
    medical crisis. Accordingly, I find that the evidence relied upon  does
    not meet the requirements of the Rules.

21.  It does not follow that the Appellant's case must  be  dismissed  under
    the broader consideration of Article 8. Indeed my  conclusion  -  as  I
    indicated to the parties at the completion of the hearing - is that the
    appeals should be allowed.

22.  Although the evidence of Doctor Patil is not 'on point' as regards  the
    Rules,  it  is  nonetheless  useful  evidence  in   understanding   the
    predicament that the Appellant will more than likely face  if  returned
    to India. In my judgement it is more likely than not that the Appellant
    will  suffer  recurring  episodes  of  respiratory  infection,  with  a
    substantial consequent risk,  and  in  any  event  an  underlying  risk
    irrespective of respiratory infection, of further cardiac arrest and/or
    cardiovascular accident (stroke). In the event of such  episodes  there
    is a very real prospect of death.

23.  In this context I have had regard to GS (India) and others v  Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40, in  particular  at
    paragraph 111. The concluding sentences of that paragraph are in  these
    terms:

    "... two essential  points  are  being  made.  First,  the  absence  or
    inadequacy of medical treatment, even life-preserving treatment, in the
    country of return, cannot be relied on at  all  as  a  factor  engaging
    article 8: if that is all there is,  the  claim  must  fail.  Secondly,
    where article 8 is engaged by other factors, the fact that the claimant
    is receiving medical  treatment  in  this  country  which  may  not  be
    available  in  the  country  of  return  may  be  a   factor   in   the
    proportionality exercise; but that  factor  cannot  be  treated  as  by
    itself giving rise to a breach since  that  would  contravene  the  "no
    obligation to treat" principle".

24.  On the facts here it is not simply  the  aspect  of  medical  treatment
    that is relied upon as engaging Article 8. Indeed it seems to  me  that
    the primary aspect of Article 8 is the enjoyment of close  family  life
    with the Appellants' sons in the UK and the particular care  that  both
    Appellants, and in particular the First Appellant, receive  in  respect
    of daily living activities  in  a  practical  sense,  as  well  as  the
    emotional support that both receive by living in the same household  as
    their son and his family. The medical aspect is a further factor -  and
    indeed in my judgement a significant factor - but it is  not  the  only
    factor, and as such may appropriately be  taken  into  account  in  the
    proportionality exercise.

25.  I take all of the  above  matters  forward  into  my  consideration  of
    proportionality.

26.  Although, as noted above, there is no  issue  between  the  parties  in
    respect of the first and second Razgar  questions,  it  is  appropriate
    that I make some observations as to the quality of family life  enjoyed
    in the UK, and  the  extent  of  the  interference  that  would  result
    consequent to the removal of the Appellants.  In  my  judgement  it  is
    clear that there has been  a  significant  deterioration  in  both  the
    underlying medical conditions and the concomitant  care  needs  of  the
    First Appellant, such that his ability to meet his own care needs, even
    with the assistance of his wife, is now severely limited in  comparison
    with the circumstances prior to the couple's arrival in the UK.  Whilst
    the Appellants have failed to put any evidence before  me  to  indicate
    that arrangements could not been made for  the  provision  of  personal
    care in India, it is to be acknowledged that any such care  would  lack
    the familial affection enjoyed in the  UK,  and  that  both  Appellants
    would in any event be without the emotional support they  receive  from
    being in the presence of their son and his family. In  this  context  I
    note in particular the emotional fragility of the First Appellant,  and
    the fact that he frequently asks for his son when  his  son  is  absent
    from the home at work.

27.  Whilst the visits of the Appellant's sons to  India  on  an  occasional
    basis may have provided some temporary assistance and respite from  the
    burden of caring for each other, with the increasing  care  needs  such
    occasional  visits  are  more  likely  than  not  going  to   have   an
    increasingly marginal remedial effect.

28.  In my judgement it is a significant enhancement to the quality of  life
    of both the First Appellant and the Second Appellant that they are able
    to reside in the same household as one  of  their  children,  and  that
    their needs, both emotionally and practically are  being  met.  I  find
    that such needs would not be met to the same standard, and  this  would
    have an impact on the emotional well-being of both  Appellants  with  a
    concomitant risk to their physical health.  As  such  the  interference
    with the Appellants' Article 8 rights inherent upon their removal would
    be significant and impact upon aspects of both family life and  private
    life (personal integrity).


29.  I have had regard to the public  interest  considerations  set  out  at
    section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002.  I
    recognise and acknowledge the public  interest  in  the  imperative  of
    maintaining effective  immigration  control,  and  also  that  this  is
    generally best done so far as possible by the consistent application of
    a set of published Rules.

30.  As regards the Appellants' immigration histories  I  note  that  it  is
    accepted that the applications for leave to remain were prompted  by  a
    genuine and unanticipated change of circumstance; further there  is  no
    suggestion in this case at all that the Appellants have attempted to do
    anything other than observe the requirements of immigration control, by
    duly making an appropriate application within the period of their leave
    - there is no suggestion of an attempt to 'play the system' by securing
    entry in one capacity and cynically seeking to switch once  present  in
    the UK. Whilst ultimately such  compliance  with  the  requirements  of
    immigration control are a neutral factor in the overall balance, it  is
    appropriate to record that there is  no  negative  aspect,  or  adverse
    weight to be accorded, in this regard.

31.  In respect  of  section  117B(2),  under  the  Immigration  Rules  both
    Appellants would be  exempt  from  the  English  language  requirements
    because they are over 65 years old. Realistically, given their age  and
    infirmity  this  is  not  a  case  where  there  is  much  prospect  of
    integration into wider society. In  all  such  circumstances  I  accord
    some, but not significant, adverse weight to  the  inability  to  speak
    English.

32.  No issue has been taken in respect of the financial  support  available
    to the Appellants through their sons. In this context I note  that  the
    letter of application dated 11 December 2013 indicated household income
    in each of the tax years ending 2012 and 2013 in excess of �50,000.  It
    is also the case that the sponsor was habitually giving an allowance to
    his parents whilst in India of between �3000 - �4000 each year -  funds
    which are necessarily available to expend upon them in the UK.

33.  As regards section 117B(4) and (5), this case is premised more  on  the
    family life aspect than the private life aspect of Article  8,  and  so
    the precarious nature of immigration status is less germane.

34.  On the very particular facts of these  appeals,  I  find  there  to  be
    compelling circumstances that would  make  removal  of  the  Appellants
    disproportionate. There is an accumulation of factors:  the  extent  of
    the  deterioration  in  health  of  the  First  Appellant;  the  impact
    emotionally on the Second Appellant - in my  judgement  exacerbated  by
    her awareness of her own inability to provide the care needed - and the
    potential impact physically upon  her  in  the  event  of  return;  the
    practical difficulties in accessing medical care in India in the  event
    of  crisis  with  potentially  fatal   consequences.   All   of   these
    circumstances  are  substantially   ameliorated   by   the   Appellants
    continuing presence in the UK with the  love  and  support  (emotional,
    practical, and financial) of their sons, and in  particular  Mr  Jasvir
    Matharu and his wife and children with whom they live. The  removal  of
    such support by the removal of the Appellants would not  be  adequately
    remedied by the support possibly available in India through agency care
    or similar. I find on balance that  that  the  extent  and  gravity  of
    interference with the Article 8  rights  of  the  Appellants  would  be
    disproportionate - it is not justified in the public interest.

Notice of Decision

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge I A Lewis



To the Respondent
Fee Award (This is not part of the determination)


I have allowed the appeals, but have done so  in  significant  part  on  the
basis of evidence not before the original decision-maker; I also  note  that
the material provided in support of the applications  for  leave  to  remain
was not sufficient to meet the evidential requirements  of  the  Immigration
Rules. In all the circumstances I make no fee award.

(Although I have heard this appeal in my capacity as a Deputy Judge  of  the
Upper Tribunal, I make the Fee Award decision in my  capacity  as  a  First-
tier Tribunal Judge.)
