For the Appellant:           Ms A Benfield (counsel instructed by Theva
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:        Mr T Wilding (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the appeal of RT, a citizen  of  Sri  Lanka  born  [  ]  1989,
      against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his  appeal
      against the Respondent's decision of  13  April  2015  to  refuse  him
      asylum.


   2. His asylum claim was summarised in the refusal letter. He was a  Hindu
      of Tamil ethnicity and had lived in [M] before coming  to  the  United
      Kingdom. He was married: his wife remained in  Sri  Lanka  with  their
      daughter, as did his parents and siblings.


   3. On 20 March 2007 he was forcibly recruited to the LTTE by  a  team  of
      six of their members who arrived at the family home, and forcibly took
      both his brother and sister, and then the  Appellant  himself,  having
      detected him in a search. His siblings were released the same day  but
      he was taken to a jungle and detained for two days with  some  150-200
      other people, and told about the LTTE's fighting and policies.


   4. He was taken for weapons and political training at Poonakari  for  one
      month.  He was then amongst seven individuals selected to work in  the
      political section in Killinochi, and given a dictionary to assist  him
      in translating political articles into Tamil. He  subsequently  worked
      providing security for Thamilselvan,  a  prominent  political  leader,
      from 2 November 2007 until his death;  thereafter  he  worked  in  the
      medical section in Manalaru until the war ended in 2009.


   5. He joined his family members following the surrender of the  LTTE  and
      surrendered with them. He was then separated from them  and  arrested,
      taken to a small camp, and  then  to  Velikada  prison  where  he  was
      detained for 3 months and interrogated about his LTTE  activities  and
      whether he had participated in any fighting; he was released following
      the payment of a  bribe  after  his  family  located  him  via  senior
      officers whilst they were themselves held in a rehabilitation centre.


   6. In January 2014 he began receiving anonymous  telephone  calls  saying
      that he was considered to be an unrehabilitated LTTE member  and  that
      he would be killed. He left his job, fearing abduction.  On  27  March
      2014 three people sought to  abduct  him;  he  managed  to  escape  by
      attracting attention by screaming. He did not return home  after  this
      incident but went to his friend's house instead.  People  in  civilian
      clothes attended his home and threatened his wife whilst  seeking  his
      whereabouts. He remained in hiding with his friend for a  further  two
      days whilst his father-in-law arranged his departure with an agent; he
      left the country using a forged passport and travelled to  France.  He
      had attended one  demonstration  in  this  country  in  Wembley  since
      arriving here. His wife told him  around  3  months  before  his  full
      asylum interview that she was considering moving  out  of  their  home
      area because  she  was  receiving  ongoing  threats  from  individuals
      searching for him.


   7. At the screening interview the Appellant was asked whether he had ever
      "said or written anything which: Praises or  justifies  terrorism;  or
      tries to make other commit terrorist or criminal acts;  or  encourages
      hatred between communities. His reply was recorded thus: "I was forced
      to join the LTTE group for a period of 1ï¿½ years starting  in  2007.  I
      was an interpreter, English /Tamil: no other activity." He  was  asked
      if he had ever  been  detained  as  a  suspected  terrorist  or  enemy
      combatant, whether charged or not, and answered "no."


   8. The Secretary of State refused his application because the veracity of
      his claim was not accepted: his claim to  have  received  a  month  of
      training was inconsistent with the  public  domain  information  of  a
      standard four-month induction period and his claim that his sister had
      been allowed to return home following her original  detention  by  the
      LTTE was inconsistent with the fact  that  women  were  documented  as
      having been forced to undergo  tough  training.  Additionally  he  was
      considered to have been vague as to the political classes that he  was
      involved with, and his claim appeared to have become exaggerated as it
      proceeded through the asylum process: he had stated at  the  screening
      interview that he had only conducted work as an interpreter  but  then
      significantly expanded upon that at his substantive  interview,  which
      was also the first  occasion  at  which  he  referred  to  arrest  and
      detention.


   9. The Appellant had provided various items of supporting evidence by the
      time of the appeal hearing. Dr Dhumad provided a medical report giving
      his opinion, having discounted the possibility that the Appellant  was
      feigning his symptoms because of the difficulty  of  simulating  full-
      blown mental illness having regard to his presentation  and  emotional
      reactions, that the Appellant's presentation was consistent  with  his
      suffering from a moderate depressive episode and Post Traumatic Stress
      Disorder, and his concentration was poor. He had told  the  doctor  he
      had considered suicide such was his fear of return to Sri  Lanka.  The
      doctor commented that his participation in demonstrations  was  likely
      to be a healthy way for him to  express  his  anger  towards  the  Sri
      Lankan authorities in a country where he felt safe and supported.  The
      Appellant had alleged various kinds of mistreatment: being beaten with
      batons, wooden sticks, and the handles of pliers,  being  kicked  with
      military boots, and suspended by the arms and his toenails  extracted.
      The presence of family  members  in  Sri  Lanka  was  described  as  a
      protective factor tending to reduce the risk of suicide.


  10. A scarring  report  that  had  at  one  time  been  anticipated  never
      materialised. The Appellant provided a letter from the British  Tamils
      Forum congratulating him on joining them and a further letter from the
      Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam confirmed his involvement with
      meetings, events and demonstrations in the United Kingdom.


  11. A Country Co-Ordinator from The International  Centre  for  Prevention
      and Prosecution of Genocide (ICPPG), Mr SN, wrote  in  September  2015
      that the Appellant had actively participated  in  meetings  addressing
      genocide and human rights issues in Sri Lanka, stating that he  was  a
      potential witness to genocide and had provided written evidence  under
      oath that was to be submitted to the  UN  and  other  commissions  and
      prosecutions. He had consented to the use of his evidence  to  use  in
      UNHRC's OISL commission report in relation to prosecutions against Sri
      Lankan government and  military  officials.  A  letter  from  Subaitha
      Navaruban described the author as the former deputy secretary  general
      in the LTTE Peace Secretariat and confirmed  that  the  Appellant  had
      served as a member of the LTTE political wing under the direct control
      of Mr Tamilselvan, Head of the LTTE Political Wing. He and others  had
      been placed in an institution where they learned political science and
      English language, and e remained in LTTE service until  the  death  of
      Tamilselvan in November 2007.


  12. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed his appeal. His account  was  deemed
      incredible  because  of  the  addition  of  information  between   the
      screening and substantive interviews with respect to  aspects  of  his
      claim that he could only reasonably have himself perceived as central.
      Having stated that he had been fingerprinted by the authorities at the
      screening interview, he could not reasonably have then gone on to omit
      more  serious  mistreatment  at   their   hands.   Additionally,   the
      photographs he had put forward to corroborate his LTTE involvement did
      not remotely resemble him, and he knew no details of the bribe paid or
      other arrangements relating to his release. His claim to have received
      telephone threats  was  unlikely  given  that  the  authorities  would
      presumably have taken firmer action against him.


  13. The letter writers did not attend the hearing for their evidence to be
      tested and the Appellant's own evidence about giving evidence  in  war
      crimes proceedings was too vague to carry weight. The doctor  had  not
      commented on his likely ability to function between the period of  his
      mistreatment by the authorities and his  examination  by  the  doctor,
      when he had said that he had  worked  for  a  large  telecommunication
      service  provider.  Whilst  the  First-tier  Tribunal   accepted   the
      Appellant was a Tamil from  Sri  Lanka  who  may  have  been  forcibly
      recruited by the LTTE and who had  been  active  in  this  country  as
      claimed, the remainder of his  history  was  rejected,  and  in  those
      circumstances his activities here were as a rank and file  member  and
      did not indicate any leadership position. He was not of a  profile  to
      attract problems from the  intelligence-based  approach  known  to  be
      adopted by the Sri Lankan authorities.


  14. Grounds of appeal alleged the decision was unlawful because the First-
      tier Tribunal had


        a) Failed to take account of the limited purpose of the initial
           screening interview;
        b) Put the cart before the horse in discounting the Appellant's
           evidence and only thereafter reviewing the medical evidence;
        c) Unreasonably rejected the evidence provided by the ICPPG Country
           Co-ordinator as to the Appellant's role in the war crimes
           proceedings in Sri Lanka and failed to take account of the
           process by which evidence was given in the UN Tribunal;
        d) Failed to individually assess the level of activities undertaken
           by the Appellant;
        e) Failed to determine whether the Appellant was at risk of Article
           3 violations because of his suicidal ideation.


  15. Judge Reid granted permission to appeal on 21 March 2016 (without  any
      limitation on the grounds that might be argued) because  the  decision
      was arguably self-contradictory in its approach to the medical report.


  16. Mr Wilding made submissions consistent with the Home Office's Rule  24
      response, and submitted that the Judge's determination had  adequately
      dealt with all  relevant  considerations.  The  medical  evidence  was
      repeatedly referenced and clearly in mind before the Judge embarked on
      his  consideration  of  credibility.  His  account  had  significantly
      altered in between the screening interview and  substantive  interview
      and the Judge had been alive to the  possibility  of  only  a  summary
      claim being advanced early on. The grounds,  albeit  expressed  as  an
      assault on reasons and failures to take material  into  account,  were
      essentially a disguised perversity  challenge.  The  letter  from  the
      ICPPG was relatively old and unparticularised.  Ms Benfield  developed
      the grounds of appeal, explaining that the process of  evidence-giving
      to  the  UN  Tribunal  was  in  fact  perfectly  consistent  with  the
      Appellant's evidence, as would have been explained had the matter been
      raised at the hearing below.


  Findings and reasons


  17. This appeal  amounts  to  a  full-blown  assault  on  the  credibility
      findings made by the First-tier Tribunal. Although  extensive  reasons
      were given below, that in itself does not  prevent  them  being  found
      legally erroneous: asylum appeals  must  be  approached  applying  the
      appropriate anxious scrutiny, and  as  Carnwath  LJ  explained  in  YH
      [2010]  EWCA  Civ  116  that  term  "has  by  usage  acquired  special
      significance as underlining the very special human  context  in  which
      such cases are brought, and the need for decisions to  show  by  their
      reasoning that every factor which might tell in favour of an applicant
      has been properly taken into account."


  18. On balance it seems to me that the First-tier Tribunal  was  wrong  in
      the approach it took to the Appellant's credibility, for the following
      reasons, which collectively amount to  significant  failures  to  take
      account of material considerations.


  19. Firstly, as stated by Potter LJ in SA [2006] EWCA Civ 1302 at [32],  a
      report should not be discounted simply  because  of  findings  on  the
      other evidence in the case, as that would be to put  the  cart  before
      the horse:


        "where there is medical evidence corroborative  of  an  appellant's
        account of torture or mistreatment, it should be considered as part
        of  the  whole  package  of  evidence  going  to  the  question  of
        credibility and not simply  treated  as  an  "add-on"  or  separate
        exercise  for  subsequent  assessment  only  after  a  decision  on
        credibility has been reached on the basis of  the  content  of  the
        appellant's evidence or his performance as a witness."


      In this appeal, the error is slightly more complicated than that: the
      medical evidence receives treatment half way through the reasoning on
      the case, and whilst on the one hand the First-tier Tribunal stated
      that its contents were accepted, on the other hand it then seems that
      it was discounted because of a concern as to what the doctor might
      have opined in the light of one particular concern that struck the
      Judge below as relevant. However, it is readily apparent that some of
      the concerns expressed by the First-tier Tribunal as to the vagueness
      of his evidence were potentially capable of explanation by the likely
      consequences of the mental health problems identified by Dr Dhumad.

  20. Secondly, no consideration was given  to  the  context  in  which  the
      screening interview questions were asked, which is a vital  factor  to
      take into account when a claim is tested for elaboration: it is  clear
      that  the  questions  that  have  been  interpreted  as  inviting   an
      exposition as to his true level of involvement with the LTTE  were  in
      fact expressed such as to investigate involvement with terrorist acts,
      and it is hardly surprising that he did not advance his full  case  in
      that context.  Furthermore,  and  as  is  well  known,  the  screening
      interview is not intended to be a vehicle for exploring the  substance
      of the asylum claim: its very introduction  makes  it  clear  that  an
      asylum seeker is not expected to give details of their claim.


  21. Thirdly, I do not consider that the evidence from the ICPPG  could  be
      so readily discounted given the detail that they provided  as  to  the
      Appellant's involvement with the genocide investigation  process.  The
      Tribunal giving its Country Guidelines in GJ  and  others  (post-civil
      war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC) stated that


           "Individuals who have given evidence to the Lessons Learned and
           Reconciliation Commission implicating the Sri Lankan security
           forces, armed forces or the Sri Lankan authorities in alleged
           war crimes. Among those who may have witnessed war crimes during
           the conflict, particularly in the No-Fire Zones in May 2009,
           only those who have already identified themselves by giving such
           evidence would be known to the Sri Lankan authorities and
           therefore only they are at real risk of adverse attention or
           persecution on return as potential or actual war crimes
           witnesses."


      So this aspect of  the  Appellant's  claim  is  plainly  relevant.  As
      submitted by Ms Benfield, had the questions that concerned the  First-
      tier Tribunal been raised at the hearing, they would have received  an
      explanation. Whether or not that would  have  altered  the  First-tier
      Tribunal's reaction to the ICPPG evidence, where questions of fairness
      arise, justice needs to be seen to be done.


  22. I do not consider, given the medical report's  identification  of  the
      availability of family members as a  protective  factor  depending  to
      reduce the risk of  suicidal  ideation,  that  any  error  of  law  is
      established with respect to  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  approach  to
      suicide risks: after all, risks arising under Article 3 ECHR arise for
      assessment only if the Appellant's asylum claim fails. Were  that  the
      case, there would be no impediment to his family  providing  him  with
      the appropriate support, and it is difficult  to  see  that  the  high
      threshold identified in the authorities such as J [2005] EWCA Civ  629
      would then be surmounted. However, given that I have  found  that  the
      reasoning below is generally unsafe, I think that the next Tribunal to
      consider the matter should make  such  findings  as  it  sees  fit  on
      Article 3 ECHR in the light of the findings of fact it makes having re-
      heard the appeal overall.


  23. These errors are significant ones which displace the  very  foundation
      of the First-tier tribunal's conclusions. The appeal will have  to  be
      fully redetermined without any factual findings being  preserved,  and
      thus it is appropriate for remittal  for  hearing  afresh  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal.


          Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  flawed  by
    material error of law.
    The appeal is remitted for hearing afresh.
