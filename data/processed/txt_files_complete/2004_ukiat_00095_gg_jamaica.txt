                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. The Appellant is a citizen of Jamaica.  She appeals, with  permission,
     against the determination  of  an  Adjudicator,  Mr  George  Jamieson,
     sitting in Glasgow, dismissing her appeal against the decision of  the
     Respondent on 10th January  2003  refusing  her  indefinite  leave  to
     remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  a  dependant  relative.   She  is
     represented today by Ms Butler, instructed by Makanda Bart &  Company.
     We have, however, heard submissions only from Mr Deller,  who  appears
     on behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State.

  2. The relevant Immigration Rules are those contained in paragraph 317 of
     HC 395 as amended in respect of sub-paragraph 4 by Cm  4851  effective
     from 2nd  October  2000.   The  Adjudicator  summarised  them  in  his
     determination but we will set out the relevant parts of paragraph 317:

         "The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom as the parent, grandparent or
         other dependant relative of the person present and settled  in  the
         United Kingdom are that the person:


           (i)   is related to a person present and settled in  the  United
                 Kingdom in one of the following ways:


                 (f)   the son, daughter, sister,  brother,  uncle  or  aunt
                       over the age of  18,  if  living  alone  outside  the
                       United Kingdom in the most exceptional  compassionate
                       circumstances and  mainly  dependant  financially  on
                       relatives settled in the United Kingdom.


             ii) is joining or accompanying a  person  who  is  present  and
                 settled in the  United  Kingdom  or  who  is  on  the  same
                 occasion being admitted for settlement;


            iii) is financially wholly or mainly dependant on  the  relative
                 present and settled in the United Kingdom;  and

             iv) can and will be accommodated adequately together  with  any
                 dependants   without   recourse   to   public   funds    in
                 accommodation  which   the   sponsor   owns   or   occupies
                 exclusively, and


                 (a)   can and will be maintained adequately  together  with
                       any dependants without recourse to public funds.

             vi) has no other close relatives in his own country to whom  he
                 could turn for financial support;  [and


            vii) is not material to this appeal]."

  3. The Adjudicator found that in substance all the  requirements  of  the
     Rules could be met but identified  the  following  problem,  that  the
     named sponsor was not herself  able  to  provide  accommodation.   The
     appeal was dismissed therefore on this ground alone.  The question for
     us is whether, in the circumstances of this  case,  it  was  right  to
     restrict the  ambit  of  the  word  'sponsor'  in  the  way  that  the
     Adjudicator did.

  4. The word 'sponsor', as we have indicated, appears in  sub-paragraph  4
     of the relevant  Rule.   At  the  same  time  as  that  amendment  was
     introduced  into  the  Rules,  a  definition  of  'sponsor'  was  also
     introduced in paragraph 6.  That definition is as follows:

           "'Sponsor' means a person in relation to whom  an  applicant  is
           seeking leave to enter or remain as their spouse,  fiancï¿½(e)  or
           unmarried partner as the case may be under paragraphs 277-295."


      That definition is clearly inappropriate in  the  present  Rule,  both
      because of the context and because the Rule is in paragraph  317.   It
      follows that the Rules are silent in terms of defining  'sponsor'  for
      the purposes  of  dependants  outside  marriage  or  quasi-matrimonial
      relationships.

  5. As Mr Deller has pointed out to us, there is a difficulty  in  reading
     paragraph 317(i)(f) with paragraph 317(iii).  That  difficulty  arises
     from the use of the plural 'relatives' in the former  and  the  single
     'relative' in the latter.  So far, therefore, there is  no  assistance
     to be gained from the Rules in deciding whether it is possible for the
     purposes of paragraph  317  in  general  and  paragraph  317(i)(f)  in
     particular for there to be more than one sponsor.

  6. We turn now to the circumstances of this case and  in  particular  the
     application that was made using the  appropriate  form  called  SET(F)
     Version 04/2002, which was submitted  to  the  Respondent  dated  22nd
     November 2001.  A number of questions on that form and  their  answers
     are relevant to this appeal.  After section 1,  which  asks  questions
     about the applicant, question 2 asks the  basis  of  the  application.
     The box for an application as a dependant relative is ticked and there
     then follows the question:

           "Tell us:
            1. The full name of  your  sponsor  (the  relative(s)  you  are
               applying to stay with in the UK )
            2. His/her relationship to you"

      The first question has been answered "Phillipa Dennis" and the  second
      question has been answered "niece".


  7. At section 4, there are questions entitled 'Your  Sponsor's  Home  and
     His/Her Finances'.  There is no specific indication there  that  there
     may be more than one other person who acts as  the  sponsor.   But  in
     answer to the question 4.5 "Will your sponsor be  supporting  you  and
     all your dependants from his/her own money?" the  following  has  been
     written "I have another sponsor that gives me money,  Mrs  P  Dennis".
     It will be noticed immediately that that is the same  person  who  was
     named as the sponsor, but the sense  of  this  answer  may  have  been
     affected by the fact that in a previous  question  the  applicant  had
     answered "Vanessa Harvey" to the question  "Who  was  responsible  for
     your financial support before you came to the UK?".

  8. At section 6, the applicant is required to enclose various documentary
     evidence with the application.   One  of  the  documents  required  is
     described as follows "Passport(s) for your sponsor(s) in the  UK"  and
     the  annotation  has  been  written  "Mrs  Vanessa  Harvey's  passport
     enclosed".

  9.  Together  with  the  application  are  two  documents  described   as
     'Sponsorship  Undertaking'.   Each  of  those  documents   is   headed
     indicating that its completion is not essential  to  the  application,
     but they have both been completed.  One has been completed by  Vanessa
     Harvey, who gives her date of  birth  and  undertakes  to  assume  the
     burdens of the sponsor.  The other is completed by  Phillipa  Marraine
     Dennis who gives her date of birth and makes the same undertaking.  It
     is quite clear from those  documents  that  those  sponsors  make  the
     undertaking severally.

 10. Turning now to the  issue  before  us,  the  first  question  must  be
     whether, in principle, there  can  be  two  sponsors.   As  Mr  Deller
     frankly admitted, this is a matter on which even the  Rule  itself  is
     unable to take a consistent line.  We take the view that the terms  of
     the application form (indicating, as they do, at the points  which  we
     have set out, the possibility  of  more  than  one  person  being  the
     sponsor) concede that a sponsor can, in  principle,  consist  of  more
     than one person.  That, indeed, is what we should have  expected.   It
     cannot be unusual for a dependant relative to seek to join  a  married
     couple.  It is not unusual for sponsorship to be provided by a charity
     or by some other  body  which  may  not  have  legal  personality  and
     therefore may formally consist of more than one person.

 11.  The  question  then  is  how  a  joint  sponsorship  feeds  into  the
     requirements of the Rules.  It seems to us that provided that all  the
     individuals who together comprise a sponsor have severally  undertaken
     the responsibilities of a sponsor, it is unlikely to matter very  much
     where the support is found for accommodation and maintenance.  Whether
     it would be possible for one individual to undertake accommodation and
     a different individual  to  undertake  to  provide  maintenance  is  a
     question which does not arise in this appeal.

 12. For the reasons we have given, however, it appears to us that in  this
     case the sponsor was correctly to be taken,  reading  the  form  as  a
     whole, as the two nieces jointly and severally.  On  the  findings  of
     the Adjudicator, that sponsor was sufficient to enable  the  Appellant
     to meet the requirements of paragraph 317  and  it  follows  that  the
     Adjudicator should have allowed the appeal.

 13. We therefore allow the Appellant's  appeal  and  direct  that  she  be
     granted the leave she sought.
