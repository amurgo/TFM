Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The first appellant Muhammad Asif Ehsan was born on 27 July 1983.   His
    wife, Aamenah Rahat (date of birth 14  November  1988)  is  the  second
    appellant and their son  H  (born  in  2011).   They  are  citizens  of
    Pakistan.  I shall hereafter refer  to  the  first  appellant  as  "the
    appellant".  The appellant had applied  for  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)  Migrant.   That  application
    was refused on 31 January 2014 and the appellant appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal (Judge Pickup) which, in a determination  promulgated  on
    10 April 2014, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.  As  Judge  Pickup  noted  [3],  the
    second and third appellants are entirely dependent upon the  appeal  of
    the appellant.

 2. As Judge Pickup noted [13],

         In his application, the appellant indicated that he was relying  on
         the Group A route access to �200,000.  This comprised  monies  held
         in his own HSBC Bank account in respect  of  which  the  respondent
         accepted that he had some �29,854.33 and  �175,000  held  with  the
         Alfalah Bank in the name of a third party, his brother  Asif  Ehsan
         Malik.

 3. The appellant had provided a statement from Alfalah Bank together  with
    a letter and certificate from the bank dated 30 November  2013.   Judge
    Pickup was of the view [15] that the letter  from  the  bank  "did  not
    comply with 41-SD(a)(i)(10) in that the letter did not include the full
    address of the third party as required".  He also noted, however,  that
    the respondent had not taken  any  of  those  issues  in  refusing  the
    appellant's application.  Instead,  the  refusal  letter  records  that
    attempts had been made on three separate dates  by  the  respondent  to
    contact Alfalah Bank  in  order  to  verify  the  authenticity  of  the
    documents produced by the appellant.  No response had been forthcoming,
    as is made clear in email correspondence  adduced  by  the  respondent.
    Under the heading in the refusal letter "Applicant has access to  funds
    as required" it is recorded that the appellant claimed  25  points  but
    was awarded zero,

         the reason for this being we have attempted to verify the documents
         with Bank Alfalah Limited using standard procedures but  have  been
         unable to do so.  We have contacted the issuing bank via  email  on
         30 December 2013, 21 January 2014 and 23 January 2014 and have  not
         been able to get a response.  We  have  therefore  been  unable  to
         include this evidence in our consideration of your claim for points
         for access to funds in line with  Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration
         Rules.

    The same reason is used for the award of zero points for the categories
    "Funds held in regulated financial institutions" and "Funds  disposable
    in the United Kingdom".

 4. At [20], Judge Pickup wrote:

         In the circumstances, I am satisfied the respondent was entitled to
         seek to verify the bank documents, it  made  its  best  efforts  to
         verify those documents, and was entitled to exercise  a  discretion
         to refuse the application on being unable to satisfactorily  verify
         those documents.

 5. The judge went on [21] to find that he  could  only  consider  evidence
    that was available at the time of the application and submitted with it
    although he appears  in  that  paragraph  to  be  mainly  referring  to
    suggestions made at the First-tier Tribunal hearing by the appellant to
    the effect that he could transfer the money into another bank account.

 6. The appellant told me that he had relied upon  the  fact  that  Alfalah
    Bank Limited appears in  Appendix  P  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   In
    Appendix P, the bank appears in Table 6 under  the  heading  "Financial
    institutions whose financial statements are accepted - Pakistan".   For
    good  measure,  however,  and  notwithstanding  on  the  face  of   the
    Immigration Rules that the respondent would accept the statement  which
    he had provided, the appellant had submitted  a  certificate  from  the
    bank dated 30 November 2013.  This records,

         We have the consent  of  Mr  Arif  Ehsan  Malik...  to  share  this
         information with the Agency.  I will confirm the contents  of  this
         letter to the agency at their request.  That Mr Arif Ehsan Malik...
         is maintaining his account with Bank  Alfalah  Limited...  and  the
         available balance in his account is RS31,186,821 (�175,000)  as  of
         today.  This amount of money can be  transferred  into  the  United
         Kingdom on the request of our customer...  bank  statement  account
         maintenance letter are provided.

 7. Judge Pickup was right to note that Section  85A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  would  normally  prevent  him  from
    considering evidence which had not been submitted with the  application
    to the respondent.  However, Section 85A(4) concerns  an  appeal  under
    the Points Based System and provides, inter alia, at sub-paragraph  (c)
    that post-decision evidence may be "adduced to prove that a document is
    genuine or valid."  That provision is normally brought into play  when,
    in the course of an application, the  respondent  rejects  as  false  a
    document submitted  by  an  applicant  who  then  seeks  to  prove  its
    authenticity.  However, there seems to be no  obvious  reason  why  the
    certificate which the appellant submitted with his  application,  which
    he intended would reinforce and prove as genuine the statement from the
    bank which he had provided, should not fall within  the  provisions  of
    Section 85A.  As a result,  Judge  Pickup  arguably  erred  in  law  by
    failing to give any weight to the certificate document provided by  the
    appellant.

 8. Even if that conclusion is incorrect, there is, in my opinion,  a  more
    fundamental objection to  the  basis  upon  which  the  respondent  has
    refused this application.   I  fully  accept  that  the  respondent  is
    entitled to verify bank and other documents submitted in support of  an
    application.  Appendix P begins with a preamble which records [6]:

         UK Border Agency will continue to verify financial information from
         other institutions [i.e. those other than  the  institutions  whose
         financial statements UKBA will not accept] on a case by case  basis
         and may refuse  applications  on  the  basis  of  these  individual
         checks.

    In the present appeal, as the email evidence shows, the  bank  did  not
    reply to the respondent's enquiries with the result  that  the  enquiry
    was declared "inconclusive" (see the letter from Serena Wong to  Philip
    Mangion dated 9 April 2014).  It is difficult to see how "on the  basis
    of [this] individual check" the  appellant's  application  should  have
    been refused.  Admittedly, there was an absence of evidence to  support
    the appellant's case but  no  evidence  at  all  (for  or  against  the
    appellant) was produced as a consequence of the enquiries  which  might
    properly have led the respondent to find that money was not  available.
    On the contrary, the respondent had before it evidence from  the  bank,
    albeit provided by the appellant, which confirmed that  the  money  was
    available.  The discretion available to the respondent under the  Rules
    (that is, the preamble to Appendix P) by  the  respondent  was,  in  my
    opinion, improperly exercised because the enquiry  provided  no  proper
    basis for rejecting the appellant's evidence of funds. The decision  to
    refuse the application was, in my judgment, not in accordance with  the
    law.

 9. The Rule 24 notice of 22 May 2014 does not argue that  the  appellant's
    documents should have been rejected  because  they  did  not  meet  the
    strict requirements of the Rules nor was that argument advanced  by  Mr
    Diwnycz.  Instead, the Rule 24 reply submits that it would "be perverse
    for the judge to accept further evidence from the source [Alfalah Bank]
    that has declined to verify the original document."  With respect,  the
    bank did not decline to verify the documents; it simply did  not  reply
    to the enquiries and I find that  no  such  inference  adverse  to  the
    application could be drawn from the bank's failure to  reply.   I  find
    that the judge was entitled to consider all the evidence and he  should
    have done so.

10. In the  light  of  my  observations  and  findings,  I  set  aside  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal and have remade the  decision.
    I find that  the  appellant  has  satisfied  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules with the evidence which he submitted  in  support  of
    the application, including the bank certificate.  No argument has  been
    put before me to suggest that he had failed to meet the requirements of
    the Rules for any reasons not contained  in  the  refusal  letter.   In
    reaching that conclusion, I note that  Judge  Pickup  himself  at  [24]
    added that "I was satisfied on the evidence the appellant is  genuinely
    engaged in business,  I  have  no  reason  to  doubt  that  monies  are
    available to him."  That was the very firm view which I reached  during
    the course of the Upper Tribunal hearing and from which Mr Diwnycz  did
    not dissent.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.

DECISION

11. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal which was  promulgated  on
    10 April 2014 is set  aside.   I  have  remade  the  decisions.   These
    appeals in respect of the Immigration Rules are allowed.
