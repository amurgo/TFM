Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms P Yong instructed by Burney Legal Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on  1  March  1986.
    He came to the UK as a student on 27 September 2008  with  leave  valid
    until 31 October 2009.  His leave was subsequently extended to 2  March
    2011.  On 3 August 2011, the appellant made an application  based  upon
    human rights grounds which was refused on 13  September  2011.   On  19
    September 2011 the appellant made  a  request  for  the  respondent  to
    reconsider her decision on the basis that  he  had  married  a  British
    citizen, "EB"(the sponsor) on 2 September 2011.  On 25 April 2014,  the
    respondent confirmed her decision not to grant the appellant  leave  to
    remain under the Rules or Art 8 of the ECHR.  On that  date  also,  the
    respondent made a decision to remove the appellant under  s.10  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to Pakistan.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    promulgated on 6 January 2015, Judge A E Walker allowed the appellant's
    appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 3. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal.   On  26  February
    2015, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Andrew) granted the  Secretary  of
    State permission to appeal.

 4. On 18 March 2015, the appellant filed by facsimile a Rule  24  response
    seeking to uphold the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision.

 5. Thus, the appeal came before me on 2 June 2015.

The Judge's Decision

 6. Judge Walker heard oral evidence from the  appellant  and  sponsor  and
    accepted that evidence.  The appellant met the sponsor in May 2010  and
    their relationship developed.  The appellant is 28 years  old  and  the
    sponsor is 57 years old and is a British citizen.  The  judge  accepted
    that the appellant applied for a Certificate of Approval to  marry  the
    sponsor on 26 October 2010 whilst he had leave to remain.  However, the
    respondent did not deal with the application  until  14  June  2011  by
    which time the appellant's leave had expired  on  2  March  2011.   The
    judge accepted that the appellant had  not  been  advised  to  seek  to
    extend his leave and had:

         "not [been] told that he would have to regularise  his  immigration
         status by making an application for leave to remain notwithstanding
         the application for a Certificate of Approval."

 7. The judge considered that it would have been:

         "illogical  to  seek  a  Certificate  of  Approval  and  then  when
         necessary fail to make a further application if the  appellant  had
         been advised that this is what he needed to do.  It is not as if he
         was ignoring the issue of immigration and marital status -  he  had
         very clearly sought advice from a solicitor as is evident from  the
         papers filed in connection with the application for Certificate  of
         Approval."

 8. Further the judge accepted that the sponsor suffered from a  number  of
    health problems.  She is a diabetic  and  requires  insulin  which  she
    injects twice a day.  She has to check her own blood daily and she  has
    frequent checkups at three monthly intervals.  She required  a  regular
    check up for her eyesight.  In addition, she  suffers  from  depression
    and is prescribed mirtazapine.  In addition, recently the  sponsor  has
    suffered  from  "severe  weight  loss"  the  cause  of  which   remains
    undiagnosed.  Tests for cancer of  the  stomach  and  bowel  have  been
    negative.

 9. In relation to the sponsor's need for medical care, the judge  set  out
    in detail the Country of Origin Information Report for Pakistan at para
    38 of her determination.  Having done so, the judge concluded that:

         "only wealthy people are able to afford private  medical  care  are
         able to access the sorts of drugs that the sponsor would need."

10. At para 39, the judge went on to state:

         "It is apparent that the reason that the appellant cannot meet  the
         requirements of the Rules, either as they  were  cast  before  July
         2012 or since, is because the sponsor lives  on  benefits.   It  is
         clear from the evidence that I heard that [t]his is in part because
         of her health  problems.   It  follows  that  it  would  be  highly
         unlikely that she would be able  to  afford  medical  treatment  in
         Pakistan."

11. In addition, the judge took into account that the sponsor would:

         "face  particular  difficulties  as  a  white  woman  in  a  highly
         patriarchal [country] and according to the COR corrupt system."

12. At para 40, the judge stated:

         "It follows from these findings and I accept the evidence that  the
         sponsor as a British white woman of impoverished means would not be
         able to access the medical treatment and facilities  necessary  for
         her to maintain her health.  I also  accept  the  evidence  that  I
         heard from both the sponsor and the appellant that they  both  fear
         what their situation would be in Pakistan as it would  be  apparent
         that they are of different ethnicity and of different religions".

13. At para 40, the judge noted that:

         "the appellant and the sponsor do not have the financial  means  to
         enable them to be able to maintain their relationships by means  of
         visits."

14. Having made these findings of fact, the judge said this at paras  42  -
    43:

         "42. It was argued by the respondent that there should be reference
             to para 276ADE of the  rules in deciding this case whereas the
             appellant urged me to decide the case  on  the  basis  of  the
             rules as they were before  the  implementation  of  the   rule
             change on 09.07.2012 and that this is the ratio of the case of
             Edgehill & Another  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  407.   However
             because of the case of Ganesabalan, R (on the application  of)
             v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC  2712
             (Admin) (16 July 2014) and the proposition deriving from  that
             case  that  a  failure  to  considerer  whether  to   exercise
             discretion outside the Rules  will,  in  itself,  be  unlawful
             unless the decision would have inevitably  been  the  same,  I
             consider that this is a distinction  that  I  need  not  make.
             This is because I am satisfied as will  be  apparent  from  my
             findings  above  that  had  the  respondent   considered   the
             appellant's case even in accordance with the evidence to which
             the respondent herself referred in the refusal letter then the
             refusal would not have been maintained by the respondent.   It
             is clear that the respondent only considered  the  appellant's
             family life in  connection  with  para  276ADE.   The  refusal
             letter of the respondent only considers the sponsor's diabetic
             condition with reference to 'insurmountable  obstacles'  under
             the rules.  It is clear that the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
             long residence rules of para 276ADE  but  the  respondent  has
             completely failed to consider  the  appellant's  family  life.
             The  consideration  by  the   respondent   of   the   possible
             exceptional circumstances made no reference to the appellant's
             family life with  the  sponsor.   In  any  even  although  the
             appellant's application was made in 2011 the refusal was  made
             some 30 months after the  application  was  made  and  it  ill
             behoves the respondent to rely on this delay  to  assert  that
             the appellant should not have accumulated a family life in the
             UK in this time especially in circumstances where  the  letter
             referring to the abolition of  the   certificate  of  approval
             system advised the appellant with regard to marriage  so  that
             at the point in time when the appellant made  the  application
             for that  certificate  it  must  have  been  apparent  to  the
             respondent that the appellant had by then already  established
             a family life with the sponsor in the UK.

         43.   I  conclude  that  the  respondent  failed  to  consider  the
             appellant's position outside the rule and limited  herself  to
             consideration only of para 276ADE  and  it  therefore  follows
             that  the   decision   by   the   respondent   was   unlawful.
             Consideration  should  have  been  made  with  regard  to  the
             appellant's position under Article 8."

15. This reasoning is, in the context of an appeal, somewhat unusual as  it
    does not seek to apply Art  8  itself  but  rather  conclude  that  the
    "decision by the respondent was unlawful".

16. That said, however, the judge at para 44  went  on  to  find  that  the
    respondent's decision breached Art 8:

         "44. I am satisfied and it was not contested to the contrary by the
             respondent, that the appellant and the sponsor have  a  family
             life together.  Over the period of time that  they  have  been
             together that family life has consolidated not  least  because
             they have met various  bereavement  and  health  issues  as  a
             couple.  I am satisfied that the removal of the appellant from
             the UK would be an interference in that  family  life.   I  am
             satisfied that in the particular circumstances of the  sponsor
             and her health issues in the light of my findings  above  that
             the sponsor will not be  able  to  relocate  to  Pakistan  and
             maintain her health and safety and that she would not be  able
             to visit Pakistan because of her health and because she  could
             not afford to do so and accordingly I am  satisfied  that  the
             family life of  the  appellant  with  the  sponsor  cannot  be
             enjoyed elsewhere other than the UK.  I  also  note  that  the
             respondent did undertake steps to regularise  his  immigration
             status as I have set out above and it follows that I  conclude
             that the interference in the appellant's family  life  is  not
             proportionate to the legitimate aim of  effective  immigration
             control."

Discussion

17. The grounds of appeal and Mr Richard's submissions  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State focussed on two matters.

18. First, although the judge had set out at para 8, ss.117A  and  117B  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("NIA Act 2002"),  she
    had failed to "have regard"  to  the  factors  set  out  in  s.117B  in
    particular  that  the  appellant's  family   and   private   life   was
    "established" at a  time  when  his  immigration  status  was  at  best
    precarious and at worst unlawful.  Further, the  judge  had  failed  to
    take into account that the sponsor  (and  through  her  the  appellant)
    could not succeed under the financial requirements in Appendix  FM  and
    was not, therefore, "financially independent".   That  was  a  relevant
    matter  to  which  the  judge  was  required  to  "have  regard"  under
    s.117B(3).

19. Secondly, Mr Richards submitted that the judge was wrong to  find  that
    the appellant had "done all he could to regularise his stay"  since  he
    had not applied for leave although he had applied for a Certificate  of
    Approval which was not the same as regularising his status.

20. Ms Yong relied upon the rule 24 reply which she developed in  her  oral
    submissions.  She submitted that the judge was entitled  to  reach  the
    findings  that  she  did  in  relation  to  the  appellant  seeking  to
    regularise his stay and  she  had  taken  into  account  his  financial
    position, including the evidence that he would be offered a position as
    a taxi driver with an annual salary of "�13,124 together with overtime"
    (see para 23 of the determination).  The judge  was  also  entitled  to
    take  into  account  the  significant  delay  in  responding   to   the
    appellant's application for a certificate of approval made  in  October
    2010 but not dealt with by the respondent until June 2011.   The  judge
    had been entitled to take into account that the appellant  had  between
    four and five months of his leave left when the  application  was  made
    and it was because of the delay in resolving that application that  led
    to his leave expiring.  Ms Yong relied upon the case of Dube (ss.117A -
    117D) [2015] UKUT 00090 (IAC) that the obligation under s.117A to "have
    regard" to the factors in s.117B such that "what matters is  substance,
    not form".  She submitted that the judge's findings  that  the  sponsor
    could not  be  expected  to  go  to  Pakistan  because  of  the  health
    implications to her was one properly open to the judge.  The judge  was
    also entitled to take into account the position of  a  white  Christian
    woman in Pakistan who did not speak Urdu.

21. The respondent's grounds and Mr  Richard's  submissions  were  narrowly
    focussed.  Apart from the challenge to the  judge's  finding  that  the
    appellant had sought to  regularise  his  stay,  none  of  the  judge's
    factual findings are challenged  in  the  grounds  and  nor  were  they
    challenged by Mr Richards in his submissions.

22. As regards the finding challenged, it is at  para  35  of  the  judge's
    determination which is in these terms:

         "35. I do not accept the assertion made by the  respondent  in  the
             original letter of refusal dated 13.09.2011 that the appellant
             had remained  in  the  UK  without  seeking  to  legalise  his
             position because the appellant had made an application  for  a
             certificate of approval of marriage so that he could marry the
             sponsor on 26.10.2010 at which time he still had extant  leave
             to remain.  It is a feature of this case that there have  been
             significant delays in dealing with the appellant's application
             and this is the case with regard  to  his  application  for  a
             certificate of approval  which  was  not  dealt  with  by  the
             respondent until 14.06.2011 and by then the appellant's  leave
             had expired on  02.03.2011.   The  appellant  did  attempt  to
             follow the immigration rules by seeking  the   certificate  of
             approval and delayed his marriage  in  order  to  obtain  this
             document.  Having been told it was not necessary any longer  I
             am satisfied that he then sought to marry the sponsor as  soon
             as possible but they experienced some  difficulties  with  the
             registrars initially. I note that the solicitors that he  used
             to obtain his  certificate  of  approval  were  not  the  same
             solicitors who represented him at the appeal.  I  accept  that
             he  was  not  told  that  he  would  have  to  regularise  his
             immigration status by  making  an  application  for  leave  to
             remain  notwithstanding  the  outstanding  application  for  a
             certificate  of  approval.   Aside  from  the  fact   that   I
             considered the appellant, and for that matter the sponsor,  to
             be truthful and through witnesses, it would  be  illogical  to
             seek a certificate of approval and then when necessary fail to
             take a further application if the appellant had  been  advised
             that this is what he needed to do. It is  not  as  if  he  was
             ignoring the issue of his immigration and marital status -  he
             had very clearly sought advice from a solicitor as is  evident
             from the papers filed in connection with that application  for
             certificate of approval."

    In my judgment, the judge was  entitled  to  accept  the  evidence  and
    explanation of the appellant that he had not  understood  that  he  was
    required to seek leave as well as obtain  a  certificate  of  approval.
    That, of course, did not displace the fact that in March 2011 he became
    an overstayer but it does explain why that  happened.   I  see  nothing
    irrational in the judge's finding based upon the evidence which she was
    perfectly properly entitled to accept.

23. The only other challenge in the grounds and  Mr  Richard's  submissions
    was that the judge had failed to  "have  regard"  to  relevant  factors
    under s.117B.  The only matter relied on the ground is as follows:

         "The FTTJ does not explain  why  it  has  placed  great  weight  on
         relationship formed when the appellant had a precarious immigration
         status, nor does the Tribunal consider any of s.117B(3),  which  is
         of course relevant when the FTTJ found that the  sponsor  does  not
         work and is reliant on public funds."

24. Leaving aside the grammatical infelicities in that ground, Mr  Richards
    also in his submissions relied on the fact that the judge had failed to
    have "regard" to the appellant's family life having been formed when he
    was unlawfully in the UK.  Dealing with that latter matter  first,  the
    appellant's family life was not "established" when he was unlawfully in
    the UK.  His family life was "established" after he met the sponsor  in
    May 2010 and by 26 October 2010 they  had  decided  to  marry  and  the
    appellant sought a certificate of approval for the  marriage.   Section
    117B(4) states that:

         "Little weight should be given to - ...

         (b) a relationship formed with a qualified partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the  person  in  the
         United Kingdom unlawfully."

25. Here, the relationship was established prior to the  appellant's  leave
    expiring from 2 March 2011.  This was not a case where the relationship
    began and was "established" where,  from  the  beginning,  one  of  the
    parties to that relationship was  unlawfully  in  the  UK.   I  do  not
    consider that the judge erred in law, contrary to s.117B(4), in  giving
    the appellant's  relationship  with  the  sponsor  "weight"  given  its
    establishment at a time when he was lawfully in the UK.

26. The only other matter relied upon in the  grounds  and  by  Mr  Richard
    concerned the judge's failure to take into account that  the  appellant
    would not be "financially independent" under s.117B(3).  That provides:



         "It is in the public interest, and in particular in  the  interests
         of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons  who
         seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
         independent, because such persons -

         (a)  are not a burden on tax payers, and

         (b)  are better able to integrate into society."

27. In this case, the evidence was, and it has not been challenged  by  the
    Secretary of State, that the appellant would  be  employed  as  a  taxi
    driver on a salary of �13,124 plus overtime.  The judge did  not  doubt
    this evidence and, of course, she reached positive credibility  finding
    in relation to both the appellant and sponsor.  Even though, therefore,
    the appellant could not meet the requirements of Appendix FM, the judge
    was entitled, in my judgment, to take into  account  this  evidence  as
    establishing the financial independence of the appellant.  There was no
    evidence  before  the  judge  that  the  appellant  was  "a  burden  on
    taxpayers" in any event.  It has not been suggested that  the  benefits
    received by the sponsor  were  received  other  than  as  a  matter  of
    personal entitlement to her and had nothing to do with  the  fact  that
    the appellant was in the UK and her spouse.

28. As I have said, and I reiterate the point, both  the  grounds  and  the
    submissions made  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  were  very  narrowly
    focussed in this appeal challenging the judge's decision.   Apart  from
    the  "regularisation  point",  none  of  the  factual   findings   were
    challenged including that the sponsor could not be expected to live  in
    Pakistan taking into account all the circumstances including her health
    needs and the position of a Christian woman aged  57  living  with  the
    appellant in that country.

29. Further, it is not suggested in the grounds that the  decision  of  the
    judge is irrational or that he judge failed  to  identify  "exceptional
    circumstances" such as to outweigh the public interest.   It  is  clear
    that  the  judge  correctly  directed  herself  that  only  "compelling
    circumstances" would be sufficient to outweigh the public interest (see
    para 9 of the determination).  Whilst it may well be that  the  judge's
    reasoning  at  paras  42-43  concerned  with  the   legality   of   the
    respondent's decision was somewhat tangential to the task  she  had  to
    perform of applying Art 8, the judge nevertheless turns to that  latter
    issue correctly in para 44.

30. The grounds do not directly challenge what is said by the judge in para
    44 which I have set out above.  That reasoning is brief but has  to  be
    read together with the  totality  of  the  judge's  discussion  of  the
    evidence and her finding  in  relation  to  the  circumstances  of  the
    sponsor and appellant.  As I have said, it is not  suggested  that  the
    judge's finding in para 44 is  irrational  or  that  her  reasoning  is
    inadequate.  In any event, I see no proper basis on which it  could  be
    challenged.

31. In the light of that, I am not satisfied that the respondent has in the
    grounds or submissions made identified a material error of law  in  the
    judge's decision to allow the appellant's appeal under  Art  8  of  the
    ECHR.  That decision, therefore, stands.



Decision

32. The First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  allow  the  appellant's  appeal
    under Art 8 did not involve the making of  a  material  error  of  law.
    That decision stands.

33. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.



                                                                      Signed



                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal



TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The  appellant  having  succeeded  in  his  appeal,  I  see  no  basis   for
disagreeing with the judge's fee award, namely that a fee award of  any  fee
which has been paid or may be payable is made against the respondent.



                                                                      Signed



                                                                     A Grubb
                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal
