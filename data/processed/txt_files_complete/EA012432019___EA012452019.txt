Representation:
For the appellants:    Ms K. Tobin, of Counsel, instructed by Sriharans
Solicitors.
For the respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants, nationals of India born (respectively) on 18  September
    1987 and 17 February 1988, appeal against the decision (promulgated  on
    16 May  2019)  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  C  J  Woolley,
    dismissing their appeals  against  the  respondent's  decisions  of  26
    February 2019 refusing their  applications  of  14  December  2018  for
    permanent residence cards as dependent relatives of Mr Abdul Rahman,  a
    British citizen (the "sponsor"). The applications were refused  by  the
    respondent under the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016 (the "2016 Regulations").

 2. The first appellant, who is the sponsor's son, applied for a  permanent
    residence card as a family member of the sponsor  under  regulations  7
    and 15. The second  appellant,  who  is  the  first  appellant's  wife,
    applied for a permanent residence card as an extended family member  of
    the sponsor under regulations 8 and 15.

 3. The appellants entered the United Kingdom on 21  October  2013.  On  27
    March 2014, they were each issued with residence  cards  on  the  basis
    that the sponsor had exercised his Treaty rights  in  the  Republic  of
    Ireland between 12 August 2012 and 19 October 2013 when he returned  to
    the United Kingdom  and  it  was  accepted  that  the  appellants  were
    financially dependent on their father/father-in-law at that time.

 4. As the sponsor was a British citizen, he could not be  regarded  as  an
    "EEA national" under regulations 7 or 8 of the 2016 Regulations  unless
    regulation 9 was satisfied. Regulation 9 was amended by regulation 3(5)
    of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area  Nationals)  (EU  Exit)
    Regulations 2019 (the "2019 Amendment") so as to  include  applications
    by extended family  members  as  well  as  family  members  of  British
    citizens. The effect of the amendment taken together with the fact that
    the respondent had accepted  that  the  sponsor  had  exercised  Treaty
    rights in Ireland, was that he was to be regarded as an "EEA  national"
    for the purposes of regulation 7 (in the case of the  first  appellant)
    and 8 (in the case of the second appellant) of  the  2016  Regulations.
    These aspects of regulations 7 and 8 were therefore satisfied.

 5. However, the judge said that the second appellant could not succeed  in
    her appeal because he considered that regulation 9  did  not  apply  to
    extended family members (paras 32-37). In that regard, he was referring
    to regulation 9 as it existed immediately before its amendment  by  the
    2019 Amendment. It appears that he was  not  aware  of  the  amendment.
    Although he raised this issue at the hearing (para 18), it appears that
    counsel for the appellants did not  draw  his  attention  to  the  2019
    Amendment. He plainly erred in this respect in view of the amendment of
    regulation 9 by the 2019 Amendment.

 6. The judge's error in this regard is the subject of ground 1. His  error
    is not material if he did not err in law in  reaching  his  alternative
    finding (para 37) that the second appellant had not shown that she  was
    dependent on the sponsor.

 7. I note, at this point, that, before the judge, reliance was not  placed
    on the second appellant being a member of the sponsor's household,  nor
    was this relied upon in the grounds or at the hearing before me.

 8. Regulations 7, 8 and 15, insofar as relevant to the issues, provide  as
    follows:

         7.-      "Family member"

             (3) A person ("B") who is an extended family  member  and  has
                  been issued with an  EEA  family  permit,  a  registration
                  certificate or a residence  card  must  be  treated  as  a
                  family member of A, provided-

                  (a)  B continues to satisfy the conditions  in  regulation
                      8(1A), 8(2), (3), (4) or (5); and

                  (b)  the EEA family permit,  registration  certificate  or
                      residence card remains in force.




         8.-      "Extended family member"

             (1) In these Regulations  "extended  family  member"  means  a
                  person who is not a family member of an EEA national under
                  regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who  satisfies  a
                  condition in paragraph (1A), (2), (3), (4) or (5).

             (1A)      The condition in this paragraph is that the  person-
                  ...

             (2) The condition in this paragraph is that the person is-

                  (a)  a relative of an EEA national; and

                  (b)  residing in a country other than the  United  Kingdom
                      and is dependent upon the EEA national or is a member
                      of the EEA national's household; and either-

                      (i)   is accompanying the EEA national to the  United
                           Kingdom or wants to join the EEA national in  the
                           United Kingdom; or

                      (ii)  has joined  the  EEA  national  in  the  United
                           Kingdom and continues to be  dependent  upon  the
                           EEA national, or  to  be  a  member  of  the  EEA
                           national's household.

             (3) ...

             (4) ...

             (5) ...

             (6) In these Regulations, "relevant EEA national" means, ...

             (7) In paragraphs (2),  (3)  and  (4),  "relative  of  an  EEA
                  national" includes a  relative  of  the  spouse  or  civil
                  partner of an EEA national.




         15.-     Right of permanent residence

             (1) The following persons acquire the right to reside  in  the
                  United Kingdom permanently-

                  (b)  a family member of an EEA national who is not an  EEA
                      national but who has resided in  the  United  Kingdom
                      with  the  EEA  national  in  accordance  with  these
                      Regulations for a continuous period of five years;

 9. In order to succeed in his appeal, the first appellant had to show:

    (i)    that he was a "family member" within the meaning  of  regulation
         7(1)(b). As he was over the age of 21 years, this means that he had
         to show that he was dependent on the sponsor; and

    (ii)   that he had resided in the United Kingdom with  the  sponsor  in
         accordance with the 2016 Regulations for a continuous period  of  5
         years, as required by regulation 15(1)(b).

    This means that he had to  establish  that  he  was  dependent  on  the
    sponsor for a continuous of 5 years.

10. On the second appellant's case before the judge, she had to  show  that
    she was dependent on the sponsor and continued to be dependent  on  the
    sponsor (regulation 8(2)(b)). If this was established, then she was  to
    be treated as a family member, pursuant to regulation  7(3),  with  the
    result that she too needed to establish that she had been dependent  on
    the sponsor for a continuous period of 5 years in order  to  establish,
    as required by regulation 15(1)(b), that she had resided in  accordance
    with the 2016 regulations for a continuous period of five years.

11. It follows that the key issue before the judge in each of these appeals
    was whether the first appellant/second appellant was dependent  on  the
    sponsor for a continuous period of 5 years.

12. The judge dismissed the appellants' appeals because he found  that  the
    first appellant had not shown that he  was  dependent  on  the  sponsor
    (paras 29 and 31), nor had the second appellant (para 37).

13. The case advanced before the judge and in  the  grounds  was  different
    from the case advanced by Ms  Tobin  before  me  in  oral  submissions.
    Ground 2  relied  upon  the  Upper  Tribunal's  decision  in  Lim  (EEA
    dependency) Malaysia [2013] UKUT 437 (IAC). In his response under  rule
    24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (the  "UT
    Rules"), Mr Kotas drew attention to the Court of Appeal's  judgment  in
    Lim v Entry Clearance Officer (ECO), Manila [2015] EWCA Civ 1383  which
    overturned the Upper Tribunal's decision in Lim. It is clear  from  the
    Court of Appeal's judgment in Lim that it is not enough simply to  show
    that financial support was in fact provided by the EEA national to  the
    family member/extended family member. It is necessary  for  the  family
    member/extended family member to show that he/she  needs  this  support
    from the EEA national in order to meet his or her basic needs.

14. At the hearing before me, Ms Tobin did not (and  correctly  so,  in  my
    view) place reliance upon any claimed financial dependency on the  part
    of the appellants on the sponsor. It is clear from the judge's findings
    that they had each failed  to  show  that  they  needed  the  sponsor's
    financial contributions in order to meet their basic needs.

15. The case as advanced before me was that the provision of  childcare  by
    the sponsor was itself sufficient. Ms Tobin submitted that, as  it  was
    clear that the judge had accepted that the sponsor  provided  childcare
    to the appellants' child, it was irrelevant whether they  could  afford
    to obtain childcare from an alternative source by paying for it.

16. In this regard, Ms Tobin asked me to take into account  the  fact  that
    the judge had allowed the appeal of the first appellant's sister,  Miss
    Nazeela Nilofer Abdul Rahman (EA/01247/2019), a national of India  born
    on 13 June 1992. Miss Rahman was the third appellant before the  judge.
    She is the sponsor's daughter. The sponsor had also provided  childcare
    to her child.

17. Miss Rahman arrived in the United Kingdom on 19 October 2013.  She  too
    was issued with a residence card on 27 March 2014 on the same basis  as
    the appellants were issued with their residence cards on 27 March 2014,
    i.e. that the sponsor had exercised his Treaty rights in Ireland and it
    was accepted that she was financially dependent on her father  at  that
    time. Miss Rahman also applied on 14  December  2018  for  a  permanent
    residence card as a family member of the sponsor. Her  application  was
    also refused on 26 February 2019 and she appealed.

18. The judge allowed Miss Rahman's appeal, finding: (i) that she had shown
    that  she  had  been  continuously  dependent  on  the  sponsor  for  a
    continuous period of five years; and (ii) that she had therefore  shown
    that she had resided for a continuous period of five years, as required
    by regulation 15, and that she was therefore entitled  to  a  permanent
    residence card under regulation 19. The respondent  did  not  challenge
    the judge's decision to allow her appeal and subsequently  granted  her
    leave.

19. There is therefore no appeal before the Upper Tribunal in Miss Rahman's
    case. However, the fact that her appeal was allowed was relied upon  by
    Ms Tobin in submissions before me.

The judge's decision

20. The judge directed  himself  on  relevant  case-law  on  the  issue  of
    dependency in considerable detail, referring to Jia v  Migrationsverket
    [2007] QB 545, Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013]  UKUT  00314  (IAC),
    the judgment of the European Court of Justice in Reyes [2014] EUECJ  C-
    423/12, and the Upper Tribunal's decision in Lim.

21. In summary, the judge found that, whilst the sponsor's income had  gone
    down and he was frequently overdrawn, the first appellant,  who  earned
    more than four times as much as the sponsor, and the  second  appellant
    had built up considerable assets, the second appellant  having  a  bank
    balance of over �40,000 (para 28). The house they all lived in  was  in
    the names of the first and second  appellants.  The  first  and  second
    appellants could afford to pay  for  the  childcare  that  the  sponsor
    provided to their child. The sponsor lives  in  the  first  appellant's
    house (para 29). The second appellant owns the house the sponsor  lives
    in (para 37). The judge said that, whilst it might be argued  that  the
    second appellant was a member of the sponsor's household, he found that
    this contention could not be made because the sponsor was a  member  of
    her and her husband's household and not the other way round (para 37).

22. The judge gave his reasons at paras 27-31  (in  respect  of  the  first
    appellant) and para 37 (in respect of the second appellant). Since  the
    judge's decision to allow the appeal of Miss Rahman was relied upon  by
    Ms Tobin, it is relevant to set out  paras  38-41  where  he  gave  his
    reasons for allowing her appeal. At para 42,  the  judge  set  out  his
    "Global conclusion". These paragraphs read as follows:

         "The first appellant

         27.      The first appellant is now aged 31. He is a medical doctor
             working for the NHS and has been doing so since  August  2016.
             In his application form he states that he was dependent on the
             sponsor until this date. He now earns taxable  pay  of  �3781,
             which amounts to net pay of �2669.15 a month. He and his  wife
             (the second appellant) own the house in which all  the  family
             live. He makes the mortgage payments of around �1,550 a month.
             I observe that in  the  application  it  is  stated  that  the
             mortgage is paid by the first appellant and the  sponsor,  but
             this is not the case. The sponsor confirmed in  evidence  that
             he does not pay the mortgage. The first  appellant  pays  fuel
             and insurance for his car which comes  to  �310  monthly,  and
             also  electricity  of  �60  monthly.  After  payment  of   the
             mortgage, tax, insurance and bills he has around �660 a  month
             for food and other incidental expenses.

         28.      The income of the first  appellant  exceeds  that  of  the
             sponsor by a considerable margin (he earns over four times  as
             much). The sponsor's income has in fact gone down from �13,000
             a year in 2015  to  around  �7000  -  �8000  a  year.  He  had
             contributed �15,000 to the cost  of  the  house  which  was  a
             gift/loan from the sponsor's siblings. The  sponsor  pays  the
             car loan of �369 for the first appellant,  and  the  food  and
             grocery expenses for the household.  He  maintained  that  the
             appellants  were  still  dependent  on  him.  The  sponsor  is
             frequently overdrawn on his bank account  (e.g.  on  8th  June
             2018 he was overdrawn to the extent of �973.30 which is  close
             to his limit). In contrast the  first  and  second  appellants
             have built up considerable assets (the second  appellant  does
             not contribute in a major way to the household but has a  bank
             balance of over �40,000).

         29.      As the ECJ confirmed in Reyes, the  test  is  whether  the
             applicant has established a situation of 'real' dependence. Or
             as the Upper Tribunal put it in Reyes, has the appellant shown
             that he is reliant  on  others  for  essential  living  needs.
             Applying the case law to the facts that have been established,
             I find that the first appellant has not shown  that  he  is  a
             dependant of the sponsor. The reality is that he is not  in  a
             situation of real dependence on the sponsor. The sponsor lives
             in  the  first  appellant's  house.  I  find  that  the  first
             appellant does not need the sponsor to pay for  his  car  loan
             and that he can quite well afford to  pay  for  this  himself.
             Similarly he could afford to pay for all the  household  bills
             and groceries himself. He has a child but he and his wife work
             in different hospitals and can either  look  after  the  child
             themselves while the other is working, and when  this  is  not
             possible could afford  the  childcare  costs  themselves.  The
             Upper Tribunal in Reyes stressed that the provision  must  not
             be  interpreted  so  as  to  deprive  the  provision  of   its
             effectiveness. On a holistic assessment of all the factors the
             Sponsor is dependent on the first appellant, and not the other
             way round. The true  situation  cannot  be  disguised  by  the
             artificial contrivance of him paying the car loan and  grocery
             bills (and going well into his overdraft to do  so)  when  the
             first appellant is well able to afford to pay  these  and  all
             the bills for the household. The first appellant is fully in a
             position to support himself, as the ECJ in Reyes clarified was
             the test.

         30.      The grounds of appeal invited me to also consider  whether
             the first appellant was  an  extended  family  member  of  the
             Sponsor. Mr Dolan did not seek to advance this argument to me,
             and sought only to rely on the first appellant's position as a
             family member. I  discuss  the  position  of  extended  family
             members in this appeal below, but at this point make it  clear
             for the reasons I find below that the  first  appellant  could
             not in any event qualify as an extended  family  member  under
             Regulations 7 and 9.

         31.      I find therefore that the first appellant  has  not  shown
             that he is dependent  on  the  British  Citizen  Sponsor.  His
             appeal in respect of a Permanent Residence card must therefore
             fail under the Regulations.

         The second appellant

         37.      I find therefore that the second appellant cannot  succeed
             in her appeal, as she has not  shown  that  she  is  a  family
             member of the Sponsor. If I had decided this issue differently
             I would nevertheless have found that she was not dependent  on
             the sponsor. She too is an  NHS  medical  doctor  and  earning
             accordingly (her payslip of 14.12.18 shows total gross pay  to
             date of �31,320). She has an accumulated bank balance of  some
             �40,000. Her husband pays the mortgage  for  the  house  which
             they jointly own. She is not in any  real  dependency  on  the
             Sponsor. She is fully able to support  herself.  She  and  her
             husband can manage the childcare themselves, or afford to  pay
             for it when they cannot. It might be argued that  she  remains
             part  of  the   Sponsor's   household   (applying   Regulation
             8(2)(b)(ii)) but I find that this contention cannot  be  made.
             She owns the house in which the Sponsor resides, and he  is  a
             member of her and her husband's household and  not  the  other
             way round. In addition the Sponsor is not, and never has been,
             an EEA national. I was referred to the decision in Dauhoo  but
             this is of no application to the first and  second  appellants
             as they cannot  qualify  under  Regulation  7(3)  as  extended
             family members. My primary finding remains that she  does  not
             qualify under Regulation 7(3) and 9. Her appeal in respect  of
             the refusal to issue a permanent residence card must therefore
             fail under the 2016 Regulations.

         [Miss Rahman]

         38.      [Miss Rahman] is not  employed.  I  accept  that  she  has
             always lived with the sponsor, and  that  she  derived  rights
             under Regulation 9 from him when he exercised treaty rights in
             Ireland. The respondent has pointed to the fact that  she  was
             earning an income between 2015 and 2016: some  �1500  a  month
             from Farah Medical and then �233-289 a  week  from  GI  Group.
             This income has now come to  an  end.  Dependency  can  be  by
             choice (as held by the Upper Tribunal in Lim), and the ECJ  in
             Reyes held that the prospects of a person obtaining employment
             do not affect the question of dependency.  As  Lim  also  made
             clear a person does not need  to  be  wholly  or  even  mainly
             dependent on a Sponsor - if a person requires material support
             for essential needs in part that is sufficient.

         39.      [Miss Rahman], I accept, relies on  the  sponsor  for  her
             food and groceries. The fact that she is also dependent on the
             first appellant for her housing does not affect this reliance.
             She is also dependent on her sponsor for childcare, and as she
             does not earn anything at present I  accept  that  she  cannot
             afford to pay for childcare and that she  is  reliant  on  the
             Sponsor for this. I find  that  she  has  established  a  real
             dependency on her sponsor. She is not fully in a  position  to
             support herself.

         40.      Under Regulation 15 she must show that this dependency has
             lasted throughout the five  years  so  as  to  qualify  for  a
             permanent residence card. Mr Dolan submitted that the  amounts
             of money she earned were never enough for her to fully support
             herself and that she was always dependent on the sponsor  even
             when she was earning. I find that these submissions were  well
             made. When she was earning the sponsor was  living  in  rented
             accommodation and I accept that  in  that  time  (despite  the
             names on the utility bills) that he was paying a larger amount
             towards household expenses and bills as his income was larger.
             His  evidence  is  that  he  has  always  paid  for  food  and
             groceries. Even when she  was  earning  I  accept  that  [Miss
             Rahman] was partially dependent on the Sponsor for  her  needs
             as her income was never enough to meet all  her  requirements.
             Hers was a situation of  real  dependence  based  on  all  the
             factual circumstances. She has never fully been in a  position
             to support herself. I find therefore that she has  shown  that
             she has been continuously  dependent  on  the  sponsor  for  a
             continuous period of five years.

         41.      [Miss Rahman's] appeal therefore succeeds under Regulation
             15 as she has resided in accordance with the Regulations for a
             continuous period of five years, and  she  is  entitled  to  a
             permanent residence card under Regulation 19.




         Global conclusion

         42.      Taking into account the factors I  have  discussed  above,
             the  first  and  second  appellants  are  not  entitled  to  a
             permanent residence card  under  Regulation  19  of  the  2016
             Regulations.  The  first  appellant  has  not  shown  a   real
             dependence on the sponsor and the second appellant is excluded
             from consideration as  a  family  member.  [Miss  Rahman]  has
             however shown a real dependence for a continuous period  of  5
             years  and  therefore  is  eligible  for  consideration  under
             Regulations 15 and entitled to  succeed  under  Regulation  19
             (permanent residence card). As Mr Dolan confirmed,  the  issue
             of any entitlement under Regulation 18 (residence card) is not
             subject of this appeal. If it were I would  nevertheless  have
             to make a finding that neither the first or  second  appellant
             was entitled to a residence  card  under  Regulation  18.  The
             first appellant cannot show that he is a family  member  under
             Regulation 7 as he is not dependent on the  sponsor,  and  the
             second appellant cannot show  that  she  is  either  a  Family
             member under Regulation 7, or that she is a relative of an EEA
             national under Regulation 8, because  the  Sponsor  cannot  in
             respect of her be regarded as an EEA national under Regulation
             9."

The grounds

23. There were three grounds. I have already described ground 1 at paras 4-
    6 above. Whilst grounds 2  and  3  contend  that  the  judge  erred  in
    reaching his finding that the appellants  were  not  dependent  on  the
    sponsor, the principal focus of the two grounds was on the evidence  as
    to financial dependency, although they refer also to the fact that  the
    sponsor provides some childcare to the appellants.

24. Ms Tobin informed me that in light of the Court of Appeal's judgment in
    Lim, she could not argue that there was  financial  dependency  between
    each of the appellants and the sponsor.

25. In view of the fact that Ms Tobin abandoned reliance upon any financial
    dependency, no useful purpose would be served by summarising grounds  2
    and 3.

26. The appellant's sole ground,  as  advanced  before  me,  was  that  the
    provision  of  childcare  by  the  sponsor  was  itself  sufficient  to
    establish the required dependency. As stated above, Ms Tobin  submitted
    that, as it was clear that the judge  had  accepted  that  the  sponsor
    provided childcare to the appellants' son, it  was  irrelevant  whether
    they could afford to obtain childcare from  an  alternative  source  by
    paying for it.

27. Ms Tobin submitted that  the  sponsor's  provision  of  childcare  fell
    within the scope of the Regulations. She relied upon the fact that  the
    final sentence of para 18 of the Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in  Lim
    which said that the Court in Jia "does not use the language of economic
    independence".

28. Ms  Tobin  submitted  that,  although  the  judge  had  considered  the
    sponsor's provision of childcare, he had  only  considered  it  in  the
    context of whether there was financial dependency. In saying  that  the
    appellants could pay afford to for childcare, the judge had missed  the
    point, i.e. whether the provision of childcare was  itself  sufficient.
    She submitted that, if the appellants were dependent on the sponsor for
    childcare, then they are  dependent  on  the  sponsor  irrespective  of
    whether they could afford to pay for childcare themselves.

29. I drew Ms Tobin's attention to the  penultimate  sentence  of  para  29
    where the judge said, in effect, that  financial  dependency  had  been
    artificially contrived. Ms Tobin submitted that there  was  nothing  to
    suggest that the sponsor's  provision  of  childcare  was  artificially
    contrived. She asked me to take into account that Miss Rahman's  appeal
    was allowed. She was not employed. The judge found that  her  financial
    dependency was established. She too had  relied  upon  the  sponsor  to
    provide her with childcare. The judge did not find  that  her  reliance
    upon the sponsor for childcare had been artificially contrived.

30. Mr Kotas submitted that  the  case  advanced  before  me  was  entirely
    different from  the  case  advanced  before  the  judge  and  that  the
    appellants were effectively re-litigating their  appeals  in  order  to
    respond to the Court of Appeal's judgment in Lim. On this basis  alone,
    he submitted that the judge had not erred in law. He  took  me  through
    the witness statements of the appellants and  asked  me  to  note  that
    nothing was said about the sponsor's  provision  of  childcare  in  the
    appellants' witness statements.

31. in any event, Mr Kotas submitted that Ms Tobin was attempting to draw a
    distinction which did not exist. The Court of Appeal's judgment  was  a
    complete answer. It was clear from the judge's  reasoning  at  para  29
    that, even in relation to childcare, the appellants were not  dependent
    upon the  sponsor.  The  appellants  are  able  to  provide  their  own
    childcare or pay for it to be provided.

32. In response, Ms Tobin accepted that the appellants' witness  statements
    did not mention the sponsor's provision  of  childcare.  However,  they
    gave oral evidence about  it,  although  she  accepted  that  financial
    dependency was pursued before the judge but it was not now pursued.

33. Ms Tobin submitted that the judge had  erred  in  failing  to  consider
    whether the appellants were dependent upon the sponsor's  provision  of
    childcare. He failed to consider whether dependency other than economic
    dependency could be relied upon to meet the requirement of  dependency.
    Ms Tobin informed me that, as far  as  she  was  aware,  there  was  no
    authority on the question whether dependency  that  was  not  financial
    could suffice for the purposes of the  2016  Regulations  and  that  my
    decision on the issue would be the first case dealing with the point.

34. I asked Ms Tobin how the judge could be said to have erred  in  law  if
    there was no authority on the point  and  he  had  not  been  asked  to
    consider the issue. Ms Tobin submitted that the judge erred by  failing
    to consider the final sentence of para 18  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment, albeit that she accepted that he  was  not  referred  to  the
    Court of Appeal's judgment but to the Upper Tribunal's decision in  Lim
    which was overturned by the Court of Appeal. Ms Tobin accepted that her
    submissions would mean that a lot of being asked of the  judge  but  it
    was open to him to  have  reached  the  conclusion  that  provision  of
    childcare by the sponsor was sufficient  in  itself  for  the  required
    dependency to be established.

35. Although Ms Tobin said, at the commencement of the  hearing,  that  she
    wished to apply to amend her grounds, I was of the view  that  she  did
    not need to make an application to amend her grounds,  given  that  the
    grounds do refer to childcare being provided  by  the  sponsor  to  the
    appellants. Although  it  was  not  argued  in  the  grounds  that  the
    provision of childcare was  in  itself  sufficient,  I  considered  (on
    reflection, perhaps generously) that it was open to the  appellants  to
    abandon reliance upon financial dependency  and  rely  instead  on  the
    provision of childcare alone, without amending their grounds. Mr  Kotas
    said that he did not wish to contend that an application for permission
    to amend the grounds was necessary.

36. I reserved my decision.

Assessment

37. I have concluded that the judge's error,  as  explained  at  paras  4-6
    above, is not material for four independent reasons, each of  which  is
    determinative of each of the appeals before me.

38. Firstly, it is accepted that the case  as  advanced  before  me  was  a
    different case from that advanced on the appellants' behalf before  the
    judge. Before the  judge,  the  appellants  contended  that  they  were
    financially dependent on the sponsor. His  provision  of  childcare  to
    their child was relied upon as part of their financial dependency. They
    now make a different case, that the provision of non-financial  support
    in the form of the said childcare is itself sufficient for the purposes
    of regulations 7, 8 and 15. Ms Tobin accepted that the case as advanced
    before me was not the case advanced before the judge. I therefore agree
    with Mr Kotas that the appellants  are  seeking  to  re-litigate  their
    appeals. The judge cannot be said to have erred in law  by  failing  to
    consider a case that was not put to him.

39. Secondly, Ms Tobin  submitted  that  the  judge  erred  by  failing  to
    consider the final sentence  of  para  18  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment  in  Lim  and  whether  that  suggested   that   non-financial
    dependency was  itself  sufficient.  She  submitted  that,  if  he  had
    considered the issue, it was open to him to have reached the conclusion
    that it was sufficient.

40. In my view, Ms Tobin was clutching  at  straws.  The  Robinson  obvious
    principle (derived from R v. SSHD, ex parte  Robinson  [1998]  QB  929)
    does not apply, not least because the principle that she hopes to  draw
    from the single sentence in para 18 of the Court of  Appeal's  judgment
    in Lim is not an established principle, as she accepted.  Not only  was
    this a point that has not been established,  the  judge  was  not  even
    referred to the Court of Appeal's judgment in Lim, let alone para 18 of
    that judgment.  Instead,  he  was  referred  to  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    decision in Lim which was overturned by the Court of Appeal on  appeal.
    If the appellants wished to rely upon the proposition, in reliance upon
    the final sentence of para 18 of the Court of Appeal's judgment in Lim,
    that non-financial support may be sufficient in itself to establish the
    required dependency, it was incumbent upon them  to  raise  that  issue
    before the judge.

41. I therefore have no hesitation in rejecting  the  contention  that  the
    judge erred in law by failing to consider, of his own volition, whether
    the final sentence of para 18 of the Court of Appeal's judgment in  Lim
    opened the possibility of non-financial  support  being  sufficient  in
    itself and, if so, whether the  appellants  had  established  that  the
    childcare the sponsor provided to their child was sufficient in  itself
    to enable them to establish the required dependency.

42. Thirdly, I agree with Mr Kotas that the Court of Appeal's  judgment  in
    Lim is the complete answer to the appellants' case as now advanced,  in
    any event. Pursuant to Lim, the appellants have to show that they  need
    the childcare that the sponsor provides. It is clear from  the  judge's
    findings and reasoning that the appellants can either look after  their
    child themselves or when this is not possible, they can each afford the
    childcare costs themselves (para 29 of his decision in relation to  the
    first appellant and para 37 in relation to the  second  appellant).  Ms
    Tobin's submission that, if childcare is provided by the sponsor, it is
    unnecessary to consider whether the  appellants  need  the  sponsor  to
    provide the childcare is simply wrong and  contrary  to  the  Court  of
    Appeal's judgment in Lim.

43. Ms Tobin relied upon the fact that the judge had allowed the appeal  of
    Miss Rahman and that the sponsor had also provided her with  childcare.
    In my view, this simply ignores the fact that  her  circumstances  were
    entirely different. This is because the judge found that,  as  she  was
    not earning at the date of the hearing before him, she was dependent on
    the sponsor for childcare as she could not afford to pay for  it  (para
    39). In contrast, and  as  I  have  said,  the  judge  found  that  the
    appellants can each either look after their child  themselves  or  when
    this is  not  possible,  they  can  each  afford  the  childcare  costs
    themselves (para 29 of his decision).

44. It therefore has not been shown that the judge erred in law in reaching
    his finding that the appellants had not shown that they were  dependent
    on the sponsor.

45. Fourthly, and finally, the courts will not permit EU law to be  abused.
    In O & B v Minister voor Imigratie, Integratie en asiel  (C-456/12,  12
    March 2014), the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)  defined
    abuse as an intention  to  artificially  create  a  situation  to  take
    advantage of EU rules. In Lim, Elias LJ said, at para 32:

         "32.     In my judgment,  the  critical  question  is  whether  the
             claimant is in fact in a position to support himself  or  not,
             and Reyes now makes that clear beyond doubt, in my view. That
             is a simple matter of fact. If he can support  himself,  there
             is no dependency, even  if  he  is  given  financial  material
             support by the EU citizen. Those additional resources are  not
             necessary to enable him to meet his basic needs.  If,  on  the
             other hand, he cannot support himself from his own  resources,
             the court will not ask why that  is  the  case,  save  perhaps
             where there is an abuse of rights. The fact  that  he  chooses
             not to get a job and become self-supporting is irrelevant.  It
             follows  that  on  the  facts  of  this  case,  there  was  no
             dependency. The appellant had the funds  to  support  herself.
             She  was  financially  independent  and  did  not   need   the
             additional resources for the  purpose  of  meeting  her  basic
             needs."

                                                               (My emphasis)

46. Although Elias LJ mentioned abuse of rights in the context  of  someone
    who has established dependency, it does not follow that where there  is
    such an abuse of rights in a case where the applicant has not succeeded
    in establishing dependency, it is irrelevant. It can be relevant, in an
    appropriate  case,  for  example,  as  an  additional  reason  why   an
    applicant/appellant cannot succeed.

47. In the instant case, it is clear  from  the  judge's  reasoning,  inter
    alia, that: (i) the income of the first appellant exceeded that of  the
    sponsor by a considerable margin; the first appellant earned over  four
    times as much as the sponsor; (ii) the sponsor's income had  gone  down
    and he was frequently overdrawn on his bank account, at times close  to
    his overdraft limit; (iii) in contrast, the first and second appellants
    had built up considerable assets, the second appellant  having  a  bank
    balance of over �40,000; (iv) the sponsor was living in a  house  owned
    by the first and second appellants; (v) on a holistic assessment of all
    of the factors, the sponsor was dependent on the  first  appellant  and
    not  the  other  way  around;  and  (vi)  the  circumstances  had  been
    artificially contrived by the sponsor paying for the first  appellant's
    car loan and the grocery bills and going well into his overdraft to  do
    so.

48. In my judgment, it is clear, from the judge's reasoning as a whole and,
    in  particular,  the  penultimate  sentence  of  para  29,   that   the
    appellants' circumstances had been artificially contrived in an attempt
    to bring them within the 2016 Regulations. In my judgment, this  is  an
    additional reason, independent of the  three  reasons  I  have  already
    given, why the appellants could not have  succeeded  in  their  appeals
    before the judge and why they cannot succeed in  their  appeals  before
    the Upper Tribunal.

49. As I have said at para 7 above, reliance was not placed on  the  second
    appellant being a member of the sponsor's household. In any event,  the
    judge considered that issue at para 37 and said that the  position  was
    that the sponsor was a member  of  the  first  and  second  appellants'
    household and not the other way around.

50. For the reasons given above, the error that the judge made in  relation
    to regulation 9, as explained at paras 4-6 above, is not material.

51.   I therefore dismiss the appeals of the appellants.



    Decision

    The decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Woolley  did  not
    involve the making of any error of law sufficient  for  it  to  be  set
    aside.
