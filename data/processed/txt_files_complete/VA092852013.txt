DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction
1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
   anonymity direction.  No  anonymity  direction  was  made  previously  in
   respect of this Appellant. Having considered all  the  circumstances  and
   evidence I do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.
2. The Appellant, a national of India, was born  on  1  February  1984.  The
   Appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary of  State  dated
   16 April 2013 to refuse to grant an application for entry clearance as  a
   family visitor in order to spend 4 months  with  her  sister.  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeal and the Appellant  now  appeals  with
   permission to this Tribunal.
3. The relevant paragraphs of Paragraph 41 of the Rules for the purposes  of
   this appeal provide that the applicant:
   "(i) is genuinely seeking entry as a general visitor for a limited period
   as stated by him, not exceeding 6 months or not exceeding  12  months  in
   the case of a person seeking entry  to  accompany  an  academic  visitor,
   provided in the latter case the visitor accompanying the academic visitor
   has entry clearance; and
   (ii) intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period of  the
   visit as stated by him; and
   (vi) will maintain and accommodate himself and any dependants  adequately
   out of resources available to him without recourse  to  public  funds  or
   taking employment; or  will,  with  any  dependants,  be  maintained  and
   accommodated adequately by relatives or friends;"
4. The Respondent refused the application because:
   (a) In a previous application for entry  clearance  as  a  visitor  on  5
   October 2009 the Appellant had stated that she intended  to  stay  for  1
   month and when she came she stayed for 4 months.
   (b) In a further application for entry clearance as a family  visitor  on
   30 March 2011 the Appellant stated that she  intended  to  stay  for  6-7
   weeks but in fact stayed for 4 � months.
   (c) In a further application made on 9 May 2012 the  Appellant  indicated
   that she would stay for 2 months but stayed just short of 4 months.
   (d) The Appellant did not explain how she met  her  commitments  back  in
   India when she stayed on each occasion for so much longer  than  she  had
   indicated that she would.
   (e) The Appellant was interviewed and gave unsatisfactory explanations as
   to why she repeatedly stayed longer that she stated that she would in her
   visa applications.
   (f)The bank statement produced is inconsistent with her claimed income.
   (g) There was no satisfactory explanation for the origin of the  deposits
   of Rs 40,000 on 24 January 2013.
   (h) The Appellant stated that the sponsor her sister would pay all of the
   costs of her visit. The sponsor is pregnant with  her  fourth  child  and
   there was no evidence of her  employment  status  or  whether  she  would
   receive maternity pay from her employer.
5. The First-tier Tribunal Judge heard oral evidence from the  sponsor.  The
   Judge concluded that :
   a) The issue was whether the Appellant intended to leave at  the  end  of
      the limited period of 4 months as stated by her in her application.
   b) The Appellant had a poor record  of  having  stayed  longer  that  she
      stated that she would in her  previous  three  visits  to  the  United
      Kingdom and while the Appellant  and  sponsor  gave  evidence  of  the
      reasons why she did so which the Judge recorded at paragraph 10  there
      was  no  satisfactory  or  credible  evidence  in   support   of   the
      explanations.
   c) The period of four months for her stay was an arbitrary  period  given
      that childcare support appears to be the main motive for the visit.
   d) The funds in the  Appellant's  account  do  not  provide  an  accurate
      reflection of her personal and financial circumstances.
   e) The Appellant's job is hardly secure given the amount of unpaid  leave
      she has had.
   f) The Judge did not find the explanation for the deposit of Rs40,000 was
      credible.
   g) There was no satisfactory evidence in relation to the ownership of the
      sponsor's home.
   h) In relation to maintenance  there  was  very  little  information  and
      supporting documentation in relation to the income of the sponsor  and
      her husband at the time of the decision.
   i) The decision was proportionate by reference to Article 8.
6. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Lane made the following submissions:
   a) The Judge did not  refer  to  or  apply  the  principles  set  out  in
      Sawmynaden (Family visitors-considerations)[2012] UKUT 00161(IAC)  and
      therefore failed to consider that although the  Appellant  had  stayed
      longer than she originally planned she had never  overstayed  and  the
      fact that she was assisting in childcare did not take her out  of  the
      definition of visitor.
   b) The Judge also failed to come to any conclusions  as  to  whether  the
      sponsor was a credible witness in paragraph 25.
   c) In paragraph 27 the Judge confused incentive  and  intention:  on  the
      previous occasions the Appellant had been to the  United  Kingdom  she
      had demonstrated her intention to return by returning to  India  where
      she had a job and family.
   d) In relation to the deposit of Rs40,000 into her account that had to be
      looked at in the context of the account as a whole where there  was  a
      clear paper trail for most of the deposits. It  was  not  clear  where
      this issue took the case if everything else added up.
   e) The Appellant had selected a more realistic time frame for  the  visit
      this time.
   f) The  Judge  at  paragraph  30  raised  concerns  about  the  issue  of
      accommodation although this was not an issue  raised  in  the  refusal
      letter . Had the Judge drawn those concerns  to  the  sponsor  in  the
      hearing then this could have been addressed.
   g) There had never been a problem with maintenance  during  the  previous
      visits. There was evidence in the form of a letter dated 12 April 2013
      before the Judge that the sponsor would  receive  statutory  maternity
      pay. Further the Judge failed to explain why when the balance  of  the
      sponsors account was between �5800-�6800 this would be insufficient to
      bear the additional costs of the visit.
   h) There was a letter on file in relation to  the  payment  of  statutory
      maternity pay which was not referred to by the Judge.
7. On behalf of the Respondent Ms Brocklesby Weller submitted :
   a) The Judge was alert to the fact that the Appellant  had  never  stayed
      beyond the maximum period of 6 months but she was entitled to look  at
      the fact that the Appellant had always stayed longer than she said she
      would.
   b) The Judge made clear that she did not accept the oral evidence of  the
      sponsor as to the reasons why she had previously  stayed  longer  that
      intended.
   c) In relation to her finding in relation to the provision  of  childcare
      this was one factor amongst others she had considered.
   d) In relation to her employment given the amount of unpaid leave she was
      given she was entitled to take the view that her employment was not  a
      significant factor in encouraging her to return. In  relation  to  the
      deposit of 40,000 into her account the Judge found the explanation was
      credible.
   e) She conceded that the issue of accommodation was  not  raised  in  the
      refusal letter or in submissions. However both that and the  issue  of
      maintenance were not material if the court was with her in relation to
      'intention.'
   f) This was just a disagreement with the findings
Error of Law
8. The grounds of appeal to the Upper tribunal content that  the  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge erred in two respects.
9. It is firstly contended that the  Judge  failed  to  apply  the  guidance
   provided in the case of Sawmynaden  and did not take  into  account  that
   while she  stayed  longer  than  intended  on  each  occasion  she  never
   overstayed the period of 6 months.
10. I am satisfied that the Judge  directed  herself  correctly  as  to  the
   issues in this case. The provision of paragraph 41 of the Rules that  was
   in issue not only requires that the Appellant intends to leave  within  6
   months but also requires that she is genuinely seeking entry as a general
   visitor for a 'limited period as stated by him'. The importance  of  this
   provision is obvious in that the period of time that an applicant  states
   they intend to stay in the United Kingdom is the period by  reference  to
   which other issues are assessed: a longer stay changes the factual  basis
   on which the ECO made their assessment. I remind myself of what was  said
   by Mr Justice Mc Closky in Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]
   UKUT 00112 (IAC) :
   "good administration requires applicants to engage with the  system  and,
   further, we consider that there are duties of candour and co-operation on
   all applicants."
11. The Judge was entitled to find that there had  been  a  failure  by  the
   Appellant in her previous immigration history to set out  the  length  of
   her stay with candour  and  having  seen  and  set  out  the  Appellant's
   explanation and  heard  the  witnesses  give  evidence  to  reject  their
   explanation.
12. There can be no other conclusion to draw from the  Judges  rejection  of
   the explanations for both the Appellant staying longer than she  did  and
   for the Rs40,000 deposit than the Judge  found  the  witnesses  were  not
   credible.
13. The Judge made findings that were open  to  her  in  relation  to  those
   factors which might impact on her intention to return arising out of  her
   social and financial  circumstances  and  I  do  not  consider  there  is
   anything  she  said  that  suggests  she  has  confused  incentive   with
   intention.  She did not discount the Appellant's  employment  but  merely
   stated that given the repeated period of unpaid leave she  was  given  it
   would not be a 'major' factor.(paragraph 27) She  recognises  that  while
   the Appellant has a parent who is alive the Appellant  is  not  the  sole
   carer.
14. I am satisfied that it was open to the Judge  to  consider  whether  the
   Appellant's financial circumstances were accurately  set  out   as  again
   there is a duty of candour as her financial security is a factor  against
   which the ECO would  have  assessed  her  intention  to  return.  It  was
   therefore open to the Judge to find that there was an unexplained deposit
   in her account that was not consistent with  her  claimed  earnings.  The
   Judge had the Appellant's explanation before  her  and  again  heard  the
   witnesses give evidence on this issue and did not find that  the  deposit
   had been satisfactorily explained. This was a finding that  was  open  to
   her.
15. I have considered the challenge to the Judge's finding  in  relation  to
   maintenance. Given that the Judge was required to assess the adequacy  of
   maintenance against the stated period of the visit I  am  satisfied  that
   having found on the basis of her previous history that the Appellant  was
   not truthful as to the intended period of her  stay  the  fact  that  the
   Judge may not have taken into account th  level  of  funds  in  the  bank
   account of the evidence of the payment of statutory maternity pay made no
   material difference to the decision.
16. I accept that it was not open  to  the  Judge  to  raise  the  issue  of
   accommodation given that it was not raised in the refusal letter and  she
   did  not  raise  her  concerns  in  court  to  allow  the  advocates   to
   specifically address it. However given my other findings I  am  satisfied
   that this made no material difference to the outcome of the case.

CONCLUSION

17. I therefore found that no errors of law have been established  and  that
   the Judge's determination should stand.

DECISION

18. The appeal is dismissed.
