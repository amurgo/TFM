For the Respondent:                 In person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. In this determination I will refer to Dr Ibrahim as the  Appellant  and
    to the Secretary of State as the Respondent, as they  were  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The Appellant is from  Kenya  and  came  to  this
    country,  apparently  with  the  assistance  of  a  Kenyan   Government
    scholarship, to study medicine, which she  did  at  the  University  of
    Nottingham. She has been successful in her examinations but  needed  to
    follow those through with Foundation years  1  and  2  of  the  medical
    course. On 17th September 2013, whilst her leave remained  extant,  she
    applied to vary that leave in order to follow a course of  study  as  a
    Foundation Doctor, terminating on 4th August 2015.  Her then leave  was
    due to expire on 19th October 2013.

 2. Her application was refused on 1st November  2013.   She  received  the
    necessary 30 points in respect of her Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies but  was  awarded  no  points  for  maintenance  (funds).   The
    narrative of the refusal states that she was required  to  show  living
    costs of �1,600 plus her outstanding course fees, which  in  fact  were
    not then due.   She was required to show  that  sum  of  �1,600  for  a
    consecutive  28  day  period  in  order   to   meet   the   maintenance
    requirements.  As the closing balance of the bank  statement  submitted
    with her application was dated 17th September 2013 she needed  to  show
    evidence of at least that sum for 28 days from 21st August 2013 to 17th
    September 2013.  However it was noted that on 21st August 2013 the bank
    statement submitted showed a balance of �100 which did not  demonstrate
    that she had the required level of funds.  The application was  refused
    with reference to paragraph 245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Appellant appealed, requesting that the appeal  be  dealt  with  on
    papers.  It was allocated  for  determination  to  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Fox at the Glasgow Hearing Centre.  He referred  to  the  refusal
    notice and found that the Appellant could not meet the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.  He noted what the Appellant  had  said  in  her
    Notice of Appeal.  The Appellant  commented  that  when  she  made  her
    application in September 2013 she had graduated from Nottingham and had
    just moved  to  Birmingham  and  started  working  for  the  NHS  as  a
    Foundation Doctor.  She had mistakenly not  been  aware  that  she  was
    required to show possession of �1,600 for a consecutive 28  day  period
    and after paying her first and last month's rent  bills  and  different
    subscription fees the balance was below �1,600  for  the  necessary  28
    consecutive days.  Her updated bank statements covering the most recent
    28 day period showed that there were sufficient funds when she had been
    studying medicine in the UK. She had paid the tuition fees  of  �25,000
    on time and  had  passed  all  of  her  examinations.   She  had  never
    defaulted in any way.

 4. Judge Fox noted that bank statements submitted for the hearing covering
    the period 30th October 2013 to 27th November 2013 indicated  that  the
    balance did not at any point during that period fall below �1,900.   He
    continued as follows:

         "13. Given that the Appellant has had a number of visas in the past
             and she has adhered to all the Immigration  Rules  to  date  I
             consider it would be unfair in all the  circumstances  not  to
             exercise flexibility  in  regard  to  the  production  of  her
             account.  At the date that she applied for her visa  extension
             she was in the middle  of  a  very  traumatic  period  in  her
             professional life, having just  graduated  and  commenced  the
             Foundation aspect of her professional career.  There has  been
             considerable demand on her finances at this time and it is not
             surprising that she may have lost track  of  what  was  coming
             into and going out of her account.

          14. Examination of her earlier account does show that  there  were
             considerable  periods  when  she  could  not  have   met   the
             Regulations.  There was no requirement on her to do so at that
             time.  Also, she was not working at that time.  As she has now
             produced bank statements which bring her within the  Rules  it
             is just and equitable that flexibility be exercised  admitting
             this most recent statement.

          15. In these circumstances I am satisfied that leave to remain and
             a biometric residence card should be issued to  the  Appellant
             as confirmation of her right to reside in the United Kingdom.

          16. I have considered the Appellant's claim under the Human Rights
             Act 1998 Article 8.  I find that the  UK  Government,  in  its
             exercise of a fair  and  firm  immigration  policy  has  acted
             disproportionately by refusing to issue  the  residence  card.
             There has been private life which has been interfered with  in
             an entirely disproportionate manner."

 5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal.  It  was  contended
    that the judge had erred in law.  He had found that the Appellant could
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It was made  clear
    in Shahzad (Art. 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT  85  (IAC)  that  as  a
    general Rule ignorance of the law was no excuse.  It was contended that
    the judge had given weight to immaterial matters by  stating  that  the
    Appellant could have satisfied the  Rules  at  other  points  in  time.
    Reference was made to the judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Miah  and
    Others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ  261  as  authority  that  there  was  no
    principle of a near miss and that view had been endorsed by the Supreme
    Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72.  It was also said that
    the judge had considered Article 8 without any real substance.  He  had
    given no assessment of the requirements of the  Rules  and  reaced  his
    decision without consideration of comments made in Patel concerning the
    ambit of Article 8.

 6. Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge White on 15th April
    2014.

 7. The Appellant attended the hearing in person.  She said  that  she  was
    about to embark on the second Foundation year at  the  Queen  Elizabeth
    Hospital in Birmingham.  Mr Smart relied upon the application and  said
    that  Article  8  was  not  introduced  in  order  to  circumvent   the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge appeared to  have  considered  additional
    bank statements although they had  not  been  submitted  prior  to  the
    application, or decision, and to do so was contrary to Section  85A  of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   He  had  failed  to
    consider whether Article 8 was engaged at all and whether having regard
    to Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 00640
    (IAC) Article 8 fell to be considered.

 8.  The  Appellant  said  that  she  did  understand  the  position.   The
    Foundation year was still part of her training and at the time  of  the
    application she had moved from Nottingham and had been under  financial
    pressure.  She thought that Judge Fox had taken a  pragmatic  approach.
    She also said she thought that she could have avoided her  problems  if
    the refusal had been received earlier because she could have re-applied
    while she had extant leave but by the time she received the refusal her
    leave had expired.  She said that she had  contacted  the  Home  Office
    upon receipt of the refusal and had been told that she could appeal and
    she had decided to do so but now realised that she could  have  made  a
    further application.

 9. Having considered what had been said I came to the view that the  judge
    had made a material error of law in  his  approach.   He  found,  quite
    rightly, that the Appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  He was understandably sympathetic to the dilemma in
    which  the  Appellant  found  herself  and,  at  paragraph  13  of  his
    determination, considered it unfair not to exercise flexibility but  he
    gave no legal basis for doing so and none is apparent.  In his approach
    to Article 8 he did not follow the approach summarised in recent  cases
    such as R (Nagre) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan (Article 8
    - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  640  (IAC).   Nor  had  he
    considered the ambit of Article 8 in student cases set out in Patel  or
    followed the steps outlined by Lord Bingham in R (Razgar) v SSHD [2004]
    UKHL 27. I set his decision aside.

10. I was in a position to re-decide the appeal which I said I would do  on
    the basis of the information before me.  It is clear that the Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules as the bank statement  she
    had submitted with her application showed that she  did  not  meet  the
    financial requirements.  The application was  made  on  17th  September
    2013 and the refusal was dated 1st November 2013.  There  had  been  no
    untoward delay on the part of the  Home  Office  in  dealing  with  the
    application.  The Appellant said that she spoke to the Home Office  who
    said she could appeal but it was not for the Home Office to advise her.
     She could have made a further application, as she can at any time.

11. The Appellant cannot succeed under the Immigration  Rules  relating  to
    student applications and neither can she succeed under paragraph 276ADE
    of the Rules.  It is  clear  from  the  approach  taken  in  Nagre  and
    Gulshan, as also in Shahzad upon  which  the  Respondent  relied,  that
    there need to be arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules for Article 8 to be considered.  The Appellant  faces
    a fundamental problem in this respect.  She does not seek to rely  upon
    any family life aspect of Article 8 but only upon  private  life.   The
    only significant private life relates to her education and training  as
    a medical doctor.  Had the Razgar steps been followed  it  is  at  this
    stage that it would have been decided whether Article 8 was potentially
    involved.  The  jurisprudence  has  become  clearer  of  late  in  this
    respect.  At paragraph 57 of Patel and Others v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  72
    Lord Carnwath stated as follows:

         "It is important to remember  that  article  8  is  not  a  general
         dispensing power.  It is to be distinguished from the Secretary  of
         State's discretion to allow leave to remain outside the rules which
         may be unrelated to any protected human rights.  The  merits  of  a
         decision not to depart from the rules are not reviewable on appeal:
         section 86(6).  One may sympathise with Sedley LJ's call in Pankina
         for "common sense" in the application of the rules to graduates who
         have been studying in the UK for some years (see  para  47  above).
         However, such considerations do not by themselves  provide  grounds
         of appeal under article 8,  which  is  concerned  with  private  or
         family  life,  not  education  as  such.   The  opportunity  for  a
         promising student to complete his course in this  country,  however
         desirable in general terms, is not in itself a right to protect  it
         under article 8."


    Unfortunately for the Appellant, as is apparent from the  extract  from
    Patel above, the continuation of her medical training is  not  a  right
    protected by Article 8.  Her appeal must fail. She is free to re-apply,
    either in this country (although a refusal would  not  now  generate  a
    right of appeal) or from Kenya.

12. The Appellant has clearly worked  hard  at  her  studies  and  deserves
    congratulation for her application and success.  This  may  well  be  a
    case in which it would be appropriate for the  Secretary  of  State  to
    consider the grant of leave for a limited  period,  to  enable  her  to
    conclude the course, outside the Rules.  However that is not  a  matter
    for judicial decision.

13. Judge Fox made a fee award against  the  Respondent.   That  fee  award
    necessarily falls with the setting aside of his decision.

Decision

14. The original determination contained a material error on a point of law
    and has been set aside.

15. I have re-made the decision and for the  reasons  set  out  above  this
    appeal is dismissed.
