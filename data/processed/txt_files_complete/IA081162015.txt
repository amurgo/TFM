For the Respondent:    Mr A. Burrett, Counsel instructed by Saracens
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeal Team has appealed to the Upper Tribunal from  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Zahed  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 17 September 2015) allowing the claimant's  appeal  (d.o.b.  1
    July 1945) against the decision to refuse to grant her leave to  remain
    on the grounds of long residence.  The judge allowed the  appeal  under
    the twenty year rule in Rule 276ADE and also on Article 8 ECHR  grounds
    outside the rules. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity
    direction, and I do not consider that the claimant  requires  anonymity
    for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Permission to Appeal was granted on Ground 1, as the claimant  had  not
    resided for 20 years in the UK at the date of  application.  Permission
    to Appeal was refused on Ground 2, as it was held not to  be  arguable.
    Judge Landes held  that  the  judge  had  given  adequate  reasons  for
    explaining in effect why her circumstances were compelling, namely that
    by the date of the hearing she had been in the UK  for  the  length  of
    time which would lead her to qualify under the rules, and that she  was
    aged 70, with all her children and grandchildren living in the  UK  and
    with no family or assets in Iraq.

Discussion

 3. The judge erred in law in allowing the appeal under the twenty rule, as
    the claimant had not accrued twenty years' residence  at  the  time  of
    application.

 4. The issue is whether the error is material, in view of  the  fact  that
    the judge also allowed the appeal on  Article  8  grounds  outside  the
    rules, and permission to appeal has not been granted in respect of that
    part of his decision.

 5. Having heard submissions from both representatives  on  this  issue,  I
    ruled at the hearing that the error was not material. The Secretary  of
    State did not renew a permission application in respect of Ground 2  to
    the Upper Tribunal, and so the decision of  Judge  Landes  stands.  The
    appellant has thus won her human rights appeal, and it matters not that
    she has only won it outside the Rules. The consequences in terms of the
    period of leave that she will be granted will be the same.

 6. It is strongly arguable that the findings of fact  made  by  the  judge
    support the finding that the claimant meets the alternative requirement
    in Rule 276ADE of there  being  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  her
    reintegration into the country of return. But it is not  necessary  for
    me to make a finding on this.

Notice of Decision

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the claimant's  appeal
    on human rights (Article 8 ECHR) grounds did not contain  an  error  of
    law, and the decision stands.
