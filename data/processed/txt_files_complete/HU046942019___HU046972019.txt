                            DECISION AND REASONS

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

1.   By a decision promulgated on 3 September 2020 I found an error  of  law
    in the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  I  Ross  itself
    promulgated on 29 November 2019,  dismissing  the  Appellants'  appeals
    against the Respondent's decisions  dated  28  February  2019  refusing
    their human rights claims, made in the context  of  an  application  to
    remain in the UK with their adult children and the  families  of  those
    children who are settled in the  UK.   My  error  of  law  decision  is
    appended hereto for ease of reference.

2.   The Appellants are currently aged  seventy-six  and  seventy-two  years
    respectively.  They pray in aid of their application their  ill  health
    and their relationships with their children and grandchildren.  I  come
    to the detail of the claims when dealing with the evidence below.

3.   In my error of law decision,  I  gave  directions  for  the  filing  of
    further evidence in anticipation of the need to  deal,  in  particular,
    with the Appellants' medical conditions and the treatment available  to
    deal with those conditions in their home country of Pakistan.

4.   I also directed submissions in relation to the  appropriate  forum  for
    determination of the appeals and to gauge who was  likely  to  need  to
    give evidence.  That was with an eye to the specific vulnerabilities of
    the  Appellants  in  the  current  Covid-19  pandemic.   Following  the
    parties' submissions, the Tribunal determined that the  appeals  should
    be heard at a face-to-face hearing due to the likely  difficulties  for
    the  Appellants  to  give  evidence  remotely  given  their  ages   and
    infirmity.  A face-to-face hearing listed in February 2021  had  to  be
    adjourned because of the restrictions then in place.

5.    Although  both  Appellants  attended   the   hearing   with   suitable
    precautions made for their situation (although both are now  vaccinated
    against the virus), Ms Cunha indicated that she did not need to  cross-
    examine the  Second  Appellant  (who  suffers  from  dementia  and  was
    therefore unlikely to be able to provide  useful  evidence)  and  would
    take a decision whether to cross-examine  the  First  Appellant  having
    heard evidence from the Appellants' adult children.  In the  event,  it
    was unnecessary for  her  to  cross-examine  the  First  Appellant.   I
    therefore heard oral evidence only from the three  adult  children.   I
    consider both the oral and documentary evidence below but refer only to
    that evidence which is relevant to my determination of the issues.

6.   In relation to documentary evidence, I have before me the  Respondent's
    bundle, the  Appellants'  bundle  as  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    ([AB1/xx]), the Appellants' supplementary bundle as before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal  ([AB2/xx])  and  the  further  supplementary  bundle  of
    documents filed as further evidence before  this  Tribunal  ([AB3/xx]).
    In relation to the latter, that  evidence  was  filed  after  the  date
    provided for in my earlier directions, but Ms Cunha took  no  objection
    to the late filing and indicated that she was able to deal with it.   I
    also had a skeleton argument from Mr Jones.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

7.   The Appellants are nationals of Pakistan.  They are husband  and  wife.
    They have three adult sons living in the UK, Mr Fawad  Qamar,  Mr  Syed
    Shahbaz Ali and Mr Fahim Ali.

8.   Mr Fawad Qamar  is  married  to  Mrs  Zahida  Fawad.  They  have  three
    daughters, [SW], [SZ] and [SI] (aged between thirteen and seven  years)
    and a younger child aged one  year.   According  to  the  documents  at
    [AB1/140] they had leave to remain under the points-based system  which
    was valid to March 2020.  However,  Mr  Qamar's  witness  statement  at
    [AB2/24] confirms that he and his family now have indefinite  leave  to
    remain.  He has lived in the UK since 2009.

9.   Mr Syed Shahbaz Ali ("Syed Ali") is  married  to  Mrs  Tasmia  Shahbaz.
    They have three children  -  two  daughters  [SM]  (aged  nearly  eight
    years), [SMS] (aged six years) and a son [SM] (aged three years).   The
    Syed Ali family are all British citizens.  They own their own  property
    in the UK.  The Appellants live with them.

10.  Mr Fahim Ali  is  married  to  Mrs  Alzaman  Ishtiaq.   They  have  two
    children aged three  years  and  one  year.  There  is  no  documentary
    information in the bundle as to their immigration status.  According to
    the witness statement at [AB2/24],  Mr  Ali  has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain, having lived in the UK since 2007.  His  family  live  with  Mr
    Syed Ali and his family as well as the Appellants.

11.  The Appellants also have a son living in Dubai, Mr  Qazafi  Qamar.   He
    is married with children, but it appears from the oral evidence I heard
    that, due to his immigration status now in Dubai, his wife and children
    have returned to Pakistan.   The  Appellants  also  have  other  family
    living in Pakistan, although they are not close family members.

12.  The Appellants' three adult sons living in the UK are  directors  of  a
    construction company, Brits Construction  Services  Ltd.    It  appears
    from  the  documents  at  [AB1/104-116]  that  this  is  a   profitable
    enterprise.  The documents at [AB1/117-128] show, for example, that  Mr
    Syed Ali is able to pay himself around �1350 per month (net) by way  of
    a salary.  His wife also works earning just under �1000 net per  month.
     There are documents also in that bundle showing that the company  pays
    other of the family members a salary of  roughly  �1000-�1500  net  per
    month.  No issue is taken by the Respondent as to the family's  ability
    to maintain and accommodate the Appellants.  The Appellants  would  not
    of course be entitled to  have  recourse  to  public  funds  were  they
    permitted to remain.

13.  The Appellants have been visiting the UK since 2013.  It  appears  from
    the evidence that they sold their family home in Pakistan in  2010  and
    thereafter travelled between Pakistan, Dubai and the UK.  In the period
    2013 to 2019, they visited the UK seven times. Those  visits  were  for
    between three and  five  months  on  each  occasion  ([AB1/179]).   The
    Appellants last entered the UK on 24 July 2018 on a  multi  visit  visa
    valid from 9 February 2017 to 9 February 2019.  On 17 January 2019  the
    Appellants applied to remain based on their family  and  private  life.
    Those human rights claims were refused by the decisions under appeal.

14.  In broad summary, the Second Appellant has a history  of  diabetes  and
    hypertension.  She  is  prescribed  medication  for  those  conditions.
    Whilst in the UK,  she  has  also  been  diagnosed  as  suffering  from
    vascular dementia. The more recent evidence (see below) is that she has
    developed  depression.  The  Second  Appellant  has   been   prescribed
    medication and received medical assistance whilst in the  UK,  but  all
    has been paid for privately (with the exception of the Covid-19 vaccine
    which is only available via the NHS). The  evidence  is  that  she  has
    regular reviews of her health but there is  no  evidence  that  she  is
    receiving counselling or specialist care for dementia and mental health
    issues on a regular basis.

15.  The First Appellant has less  developed  medical  conditions,  but  his
    health is said to have deteriorated during the pandemic.  According  to
    the letter at [AB3/1],  the  First  Appellant  has  sciatica  and  also
    problems with breathing and coughing due to a lung  condition.   He  is
    prescribed  anti-inflammatories  and  an  exercise  programme.   He  is
    trialling a new medication for his lung condition.   Again,  the  First
    Appellant's treatment has been paid for privately.

THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

16.  It is accepted that the Appellants cannot meet  the  Immigration  Rules
    ("the Rules") based on their family life.  They are unable to meet  the
    Rules as adult dependent relatives as they applied from within the  UK.
    In relation to their private lives, the Appellants do not  satisfy  the
    Rules based on length of residence.  It is asserted that there are very
    significant obstacles to their integration in Pakistan under  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules ("Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)").    Reliance  is
    placed on the judgment in Secretary of State for the Home Department  v
    Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 ("Kamara") and cases expanding upon what  is
    there said.   The test which  applies  to  Paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  is
    encapsulated in what is said at [14]  of  the  judgment  in  Kamara  as
    follows:

         "In my view, the concept of a foreign criminal's 'integration' into
         the country to which it is proposed that he be deported, as set out
         in section 117C(4)(c) and paragraph 399A, is a broad one. It is not
         confined to the mere ability to find a job or to sustain life while
         living in the other country. It is not  appropriate  to  treat  the
         statutory language as subject to some gloss and it will usually  be
         sufficient for a court or tribunal simply to direct itself  in  the
         terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The idea of  'integration'
         calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be made as to whether  the
         individual will be enough of an insider in terms  of  understanding
         how life in the society in that other country is carried on  and  a
         capacity  to  participate  in  it,  so  as  to  have  a  reasonable
         opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate on a day-to-
         day basis in that society and to build up within a reasonable  time
         a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give  substance  to   the
         individual's private or family life."

17.  The appeals fall mainly to  be  determined  based  on  Article  8  ECHR
    outside the Rules.  The Rules in relation to adult dependent  relatives
    ("the ADR Rules") are however instructive as to the  test  which  would
    apply if the Appellants were applying from outside the UK.   I  do  not
    set out the ADR Rules in detail as it is accepted that  the  Appellants
    are unable to meet them.  The recent judgment of the Court of Appeal in
    Mobeen v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2021] EWCA Civ 886
    ("Mobeen") is instructive.  That judgment in  turn  considers  what  is
    said in R (Britcits) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] EWCA Civ 368 ("Britcits"),  in  particular  regarding  the  high
    threshold which would apply if the case were  being  considered  within
    the Rules and the public interest being protected.

18.  In short summary, if the application were being considered  within  the
    ADR Rules, the Appellants would have to show that "as a result of  age,
    illness or disability [they] require long-term personal care to perform
    everyday tasks" and that they would be "unable, even with the practical
    and financial help of the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care
    in the country where they [would be] living" because either it  is  not
    available and cannot reasonably be provided or it is not affordable.

19.   The  Court  of  Appeal  in  Britcits  said  this  by  way  of  general
    observations about the ADR Rules:

         "58. First, the policy intended to be implemented by  the  new  ADR
             Rules, as  appears  from  the  evidence,  the  new  ADR  Rules
             themselves  and  the  Guidance,  and  confirmed  in  the  oral
             submissions of Mr Neil Sheldon, counsel for the SoS, is  clear
             enough. It is twofold: firstly, to reduce the  burden  on  the
             taxpayer for the provision of health and social care  services
             to those ADRs whose needs can reasonably and adequately be met
             in their home country; and, secondly,  to  ensure  that  those
             ADRs whose needs can only be reasonably and adequately met  in
             the UK are granted fully settled status and full access to the
             NHS and social care provided by local authorities. The  latter
             is intended to avoid disparity between ADRs depending on their
             wealth and to avoid precariousness  of  status  occasioned  by
             changes in the financial circumstances of  ADRs  once  settled
             here.

         59. Second, as is apparent from the Rules and  the  Guidance,  the
             focus is on whether the care required by the ADR applicant can
             be 'reasonably' provided and to 'the required level' in  their
             home country. As Mr Sheldon confirmed in his oral submissions,
             the provision of care in the home country must  be  reasonable
             both from the perspective of the provider and the  perspective
             of the applicant, and the standard of such care must  be  what
             is required for that particular applicant. It is possible that
             insufficient attention has been paid  in  the  past  to  these
             considerations, which focus on what care is both necessary and
             reasonable for the applicant to receive in their home country.
             Those considerations include issues as  to  the  accessibility
             and geographical location of the provision  of  care  and  the
             standard of care. They are capable of embracing emotional  and
             psychological  requirements   verified   by   expert   medical
             evidence. What is reasonable is, of course, to be  objectively
             assessed."

20.  In relation to the Appellants' medical conditions, it is not  suggested
    that removal would lead to a breach of Article 3 ECHR.  However,  their
    medical conditions are part of, indeed at the heart of, the  Article  8
    claim.  The Appellants point to the judgment of the ECtHR in Bensaid  v
    UK (2001) 33 EHRR 10 as well as the comments of Lord Justice  Moses  at
    [23] of the judgment in MM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home
    Department [2012] EWCA Civ 279.  As was said by Lord  Justice  Laws  in
    the later case of GS (India) and others v Secretary of  State  for  the
    Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 40, "failure under Article 3  does  not
    necessarily entail failure under Article 8". However, as he went on  to
    say, "Article 8 cannot prosper  without  some  separate  or  additional
    factual element which brings the case within the Article 8  paradigm  -
    the capacity to form and enjoy relationships - or a  state  of  affairs
    having some affinity with the paradigm."

21.  The  central  issue  in  these  appeals  is  whether  the  Respondent's
    decisions amount to a disproportionate interference with the family and
    private lives of the Appellants and also their families who, as I  will
    come to below, may be impacted by the removal of the  Appellants.   The
    Appellants rely in this respect on the observations  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Secretary of State for the Home  Department  v  Abbas  [2017]
    EWCA Civ 1393 pointing to the "unitary nature of a family for article 8
    purposes with the consequence that the  interference  with  the  family
    life of one is an interference with the rights of all those within  the
    ambit of the family whose rights are engaged".

22.  In terms of the assessment of proportionality,  as  the  Supreme  Court
    pointed out in R (Agyarko and Ikuga) v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 11, that requires a balance of the  strength  of
    the public interest in removal against the impact on private and family
    life.  In Hesham Ali v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2016] UKSC 60, the Supreme Court  advocated  the  use  of  a  "balance
    sheet" approach.

23.  Ultimately, the question for me is whether the decisions to refuse  the
    Appellants' claims and therefore removal of the Appellants  would  have
    an unjustifiably harsh impact on all those affected by  the  decisions.
    When considering the public interest of removal, I  am  bound  to  have
    regard to the factors set out at section 117B Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002 ("Section 117B").

24.  I do not need to set out the case-law beyond what I have  already  said
    as there was no dispute as to the tests which apply.  I therefore  move
    on to consider the evidence before me.

EVIDENCE

25.  I heard oral evidence from the Appellants' three sons to which I  refer
    as relevant below.  I also have witness  statements  from  them,  their
    wives and letters from some of their  grandchildren.   In  addition,  I
    have documents relating to their medical condition, an expert report of
    Dr Livia Holden ([AB3/18-57]) dealing with the  situation  for  elderly
    persons and availability of care in Pakistan  and  a  report  of  Peter
    Horrocks, independent social worker, at  [AB2/1-23]  dealing  with  the
    family relationships in the UK and impact of removal of the Appellants.
     I refer to those documents as appropriate to the relevant elements  of
    the claim.

The Appellants' Medical Conditions and Care Needs

26.  Given the centrality of the Appellants'  medical  conditions  to  their
    claim, it is appropriate to turn first  to  the  evidence  about  those
    medical  conditions.   Although  there  is  earlier  evidence,  it   is
    appropriate to consider those conditions in light of  the  most  recent
    information.  That appears in the letters from The Harrow  Health  Care
    Centre.  Dr Jane Woyka of that centre  has  provided  letters  dated  2
    March 2021 at [AB3/1-2] dealing with both Appellants. I  take  each  in
    turn.

27.  Dr Woyka saw the First Appellant via video on 16  February  2021.   The
    First Appellant is said to have day and night pain from  his  sciatica.
    He is also reported to have problems with breathing and coughing and is
    said to be "not as active and energetic as he was  a  year  ago".   The
    First Appellant receives anti-inflammatories for his back condition and
    has been given an exercise programme.  He is trialling a new medication
    for his lung condition.  It is said that "previously the air quality in
    Pakistan has contributed to his  irreversible  lung  condition  and  we
    would expect his breathlessness to deteriorate significantly should  he
    be in Pakistan".   The First Appellant's  back  condition  is  said  to
    "impair  his  ability  to  provide  the  level  of  support,  care  and
    supervision required by his wife".  Dr Woyka concludes this  letter  by
    summarising  that  "[a]s  a  couple  their  medical  conditions   would
    significantly deteriorate should they be returned to Pakistan."

28.  Dr Woyka saw the Second Appellant via video with her son, Fawad  Qamar.
      The  doctor  summarises  the  Second  Appellant's  condition  as   an
    "established   diagnosis   of   hypertension,    type    2    diabetes,
    hyperlipidaemia, memory impairment/dementia, depression".    She  again
    says that the Second Appellant has deteriorated  during  the  pandemic.
    She says the following:

         "She  is  more  argumentative  and  forgetful  and  her  memory  is
         worsening. She is depressed.  She is also fatiguing more easily and
         gets tired after 2 rounds of the dining table.  She  has  not  been
         outside for a year due to the pandemic. She  now  refuses  to  take
         some of her medication  specifically  Vitamin  D  supplement.   Her
         condition has declined in respect  to  memory  as  is  the  natural
         history of a dementing process.  Her mood has deteriorated  due  to
         lack of stimulation and  requirement  to  be  inside  and  lack  of
         mobility which contributes to this."

29.  As to prognosis, Dr Woyka says that there will be "ongoing  decline  of
    her cognitive function" as would be expected due to her condition.  She
    also says that the Second Appellant's other conditions would be  better
    managed in the UK where her family  will  ensure  that  she  takes  her
    medication which she would not do if left to her own devices.

30.  In terms  of  return  to  Pakistan,  Dr  Woyka  says  that  the  Second
    Appellant "is no longer  able  to  function  outside  the  ongoing  and
    immediate support of her family in the controlled circumstances of  the
    home.  If there was provision  for  24  hour  supervision  in  Pakistan
    perhaps other family members who were able to take  on  her  care  then
    removal to Pakistan could be considered".  She repeats that  the  First
    Appellant is unable to undertake that role.   In  the  event  that  the
    Appellants were removed without other family members to care for  them,
    she repeats that all the Second Appellant's  medical  conditions  would
    deteriorate.  Notwithstanding her  observation  that  the  family  "are
    finding it difficult to manage [the Second Appellant's]  outbursts  and
    refusal to  take  medication",  Dr  Woyka  considers  that  the  Second
    Appellant's family "are more likely to be successful  in  managing  her
    within the bounds of the family."

31.  The most recent evidence of the Appellants' care needs appears  in  the
    witness statements of the Appellants' sons  and  their  wives.   Tasmia
    Shahbaz with whom the Appellants live says in her statement at [AB3/12-
    13] that the Second Appellant's  dementia  has  "led  to  a  noticeable
    decrease in her health and memory".  She  says  also  that  the  Second
    Appellant also has a "knee and back bone problem" and "has  been  on  a
    wheelchair for the last few years". Although this is not  mentioned  in
    the doctor's letter, it is confirmed by the other witnesses.

32.  The most complete documentary witness evidence as  to  the  Appellants'
    condition  and  care  needs  appears,  perhaps  surprisingly,  in   the
    statement of Fawad Qamar who is the son not living  with  his  parents.
    His statement  is  at  [AB3/4-6]  and  is  particularly  detailed.   In
    relation to the current condition of the Appellants he says this:

         "Due to pandemic, the doctors have  not  booked  any  appointments.
         Therefore, if needed they do everything over the  telephone.   They
         do remote consultations.  Before the pandemic,  their  appointments
         used to be every couple of months.  Mum's condition has  got  worse
         since the pandemic.  Due to Corona, she is not going outside.   She
         is very stressed.

         We have been protecting them a lot.  Thankfully, they have  had  no
         serious illness during this time but they are  under  psychological
         pressure. They are fed up and  know  that  if  they  were  back  in
         Pakistan, they would be allowed out.  They  blame  us  for  locking
         them in.  We believe they are actually only 'healthy' (in the sense
         they have not contracted any further illnesses)  due  to  shielding
         and the extra precautions we have taken.  We have ensured they have
         an ambient temperature; they are getting extra food/supplements (eg
         vitamin D tablets,  orange  juices,  apples,  bananas)  on  a  more
         focussed basis to get their immune system better otherwise they are
         on their normal diet; and we are ensuring they are exercising.

         Mum's exercise routine is  that  she  walks  in  the  hallway.   My
         brother has a very long hallway.  She can do 6-7 steps for a minute
         or two.  My brother or  his  children  help  her.   She  does  this
         usually after dinner, before going to bed.  Outside, she has to  be
         in her wheelchair and so does not walk outside.  Additionally,  she
         suffers from the cold.  It directly attacks her throat and she  has
         to gargle with hot water to get relief.

         My father has back problems.   He  does  light  physical  exercise.
         When Dad sometimes gets pain, we have to help but when he is better
         and he does it all by himself.   He  exercises  for  only  3  to  5
         minutes daily."

33.  The Appellants themselves have provided  a  letter  which  is  dated  7
    August 2019 and appears at AB1/93.  They say that they are dependent on
    their children financially  and  physically  but  provide  very  little
    detail  about  their  care  needs.   They  say  that  they  "feel  more
    comfortable and mentally satisfied because all family members take care
    of [them]".

Availability of Care in Pakistan

34.  I turn then to the  evidence  of  care  available  in  Pakistan.   That
    evidence is to be found in the  expert  report  of  Livia  Holden,  MA,
    MPhil,  PhD  at  [AB3/18-5].   Dr  Holden  is  a  "socio-legal  scholar
    specialising in South Asia (India and Pakistan)".  She researches state
    operations in various fields.  She has provided expert  evidence  in  a
    number of immigration cases.  Her expertise was not disputed.

35.  Dr Holden opines that  "the  elderlies  experience  a  high  degree  of
    social invisibility and neglect, which can lead to  significant  social
    barriers,  economic  impoverishment,  and  exclusion  from  even  basic
    services".  By way of example, she points to a bill put forward in 2011
    to improve facilities for senior citizens  which  had  still  not  been
    approved in 2014 and to the  lack  of  infrastructure  to  assist  with
    things like mobility problems.  Dr Holden also points to  a  continuing
    poor ranking of Pakistan in the Global Age Watch Index (92nd out of  96
    countries).  She refers at [14] and [15] to the lack  of  State  income
    provision, short health life expectancy and  prevalence  of  depression
    amongst the older population.

36.  As Dr Holden points out and as was evident from  the  oral  evidence  I
    heard from the Appellants' sons, there is  a  cultural  expectation  in
    Pakistani society that children will care for  their  elderly  parents.
    That has an impact on the provision of alternative care facilities.  Dr
    Holden sets out the prospect of alternative care for the Appellants  at
    [25] to [38] of her report.  The section relating to professional  care
    is particularly relevant to my consideration and reads as follows:

         "25. The precarious state of health of the Appellants will  require
         competent  attendants  with  nurse   qualification.    Furthermore,
         constant aid is necessary for  the  daily  needs  of  the  wife  as
         specified in her children's witness  statements  where  they  state
         that she is afflicted by arthritis, blood pressure and dementia and
         that she needs a wheelchair for outdoor mobility.  The  poor  state
         of the wife's physical and mental health is confirmed  by  Dr  Jane
         Woyka, in her certificate dated 2 March 2021, who  attests  to  her
         inability to accomplish  basic  chores  as  washing,  dressing  and
         cooking.  Dr Woyka adds in her certificate dated 2 March 2021, that
         the husband who suffers from lung disease and sciatica, is  not  in
         the condition to provide the level of support, care and supervision
         required by his wife.

         26.  Very few medical institutions located only in big  cities  can
         supply the level of home  assistance  required  by  the  Appellants
         health conditions.  A  medical  institution,  the  Chugtai  Lab  in
         Islamabad offers to provide full day and night assistance  and  the
         price of the service is adjusted according to the different  levels
         of competence.  The Integrated Health Services  (HIS)  offers  home
         nursing  service,  whose  fees  vary  according  to   the   nurse's
         qualification and the service provided.  However, both institutions
         do not provide specific  assistance  to  individuals  afflicted  by
         dementia.

         27.  To the best of my knowledge  there  is  a  limited  number  of
         senior citizens living homes which offers accommodation  facilities
         for elderly with 24 hours medical assistance and services  tailored
         for the needs of elderly in Lahore.  One of  the  few  institutions
         which can provide in-house specialised  service  and  accommodation
         for the elderly afflicted by dementia in  Pakistan  is  the  Second
         Home  in  Lahore  whose  rate  starts  at  60,000  Pakistani  Rupee
         (�281.98) per months with a one-off fee of 30,000 rupee (�140.99).

         28.  An alternative to home care or residential care institution in
         Lahore might be the Alzheimer's Pakistan day care  centre,  located
         in Johar Town.  This centre offers activity  and  support  free  of
         charges to elderly individuals affected by Alzheimer and  dementia.
         Whilst this unique institution  in  Pakistan  is  laudable,  it  is
         unlikely that it will help with the necessary medical  care  needed
         by the Appellants since a doctor visits the  Alzheimer's  day  care
         only every fortnight.  Furthermore, the  institution  is  meant  to
         provide some hours of relief from the stress of assisting a  person
         suffering from dementia to the informal caregiver, who is usually a
         healthy relative.  Therefore, if there is not  a  healthy  relative
         committed to provide care to the wife,  it  is  unlikely  that  the
         Alzheimer's day care in Lahore will represent an effective solution
         to the Appellants' predicament.

         29.  If the Appellants relocated to Lahore, it is unlikely that the
         available home  care  services,  which  will  provide  medical  and
         practical assistance, will offer them the  kind  of  emotional  and
         moral support, which in Pakistan is given by  the  family  members.
         In addition, Appellants have to travel to a hospital  for  specific
         medical examinations and therapies.  Therefore,  the  effectiveness
         of the home care service depends on the financial resources of  the
         Appellant, on the logistic coordination of the  different  kind  of
         services that the Appellant needs, and on the promptness to respond
         to situations of emergency without  the  support  of  relatives  in
         Lahore."

37.  Dr Holden also provides evidence  about  the  availability  of  various
    kinds of domestic  help  and  care.   This  is  generally  provided  by
    Filipino maids.  Dr Holden says that there is a  complex  procedure  to
    hire such a maid and they are  in  any  event  unqualified  to  provide
    specialised care.  The costs of recruitment are approximately �2000 and
    monthly salary of nearly �300 with an  expectation  that  accommodation
    and food will also be provided.  Other, unqualified  domestic  help  is
    available but, says Dr Holden, "it comes with risks for the health  and
    security for  the  Appellants".   Those  risks  entail  anything  "from
    unreliability to complicity in robbery, kidnapping and murder".   On  a
    more general note, Dr Holden says that the  elderly  living  alone  are
    vulnerable to crime and violence and that families or  individuals  who
    can afford it are increasingly hiring private security guards.

38.  As I have already noted, the Appellants have sold their family home  in
    Pakistan.  As such, Dr Holden  also  deals  with  the  availability  of
    sheltered accommodation for elderly people in Pakistan.  Dr Holden says
    the following:

         "43. While the need for shelters in Pakistan is described as  being
         at unprecedented levels, the concept of shelters  for  the  elderly
         overall, and in particular for the middle  class  and  impoverished
         elderly, is relatively new.  Moreover, recent efforts by government
         officials to establish shelter homes  for  the  elderly  nationwide
         have been vigorously contested by government officials because,  it
         is argued, they undermine or contravene the Islamic injunctions for
         children to take responsibility for their elderly parents...

         ...

         45.  Shelters that accommodate individuals such as  the  Appellants
         are  exceedingly  rare.   This  factor  is  likely  to  hinder  the
         elderlies' ability to seek and obtain secure long-term  rooming  or
         housing through  public  or  private  or  non-governmental  shelter
         systems or organizations.  Moreover, the burden placed on  existing
         low-income shelter or accommodation's options is  increasing  as  a
         result of the growing proportion of individuals over the age of  60
         in Pakistan, for whom no new or additional  governmental  resources
         have   been   allocated.    Among   existing    options,    shelter
         accommodations are predominantly for  those  individuals  who  have
         lost their homes during, or migrated away from,  natural  disasters
         or conflict.  It is therefore unlikely that  the  Appellants  might
         easily resort to the service of a shelter home. "

39.  Dr Holden repeats, in relation to palliative care, the  expectation  in
    Pakistan that such will be provided by  family  members.   Accordingly,
    there is a lack of such care available outside the family unit.

40.  Dr Holden deals with the availability of medical treatment at  [54]  to
    [83] of her report.  In summary, she says that those who depend on  the
    public health system struggle to access specialist services.  She  says
    also that those patients with higher incomes often jump the  queue  due
    to corruption within the level of service  provision.   Generally,  she
    points to there being "moderate to  acute  resource  shortages,  under-
    staffing  and  the  non-availability   of   essential   medicines   and
    equipment".  Staffing provision is made more difficult by "high  levels
    of absenteeism  among  key  personnel".   Dr  Holden  points  out  that
    patients in Pakistan have unrestricted  access  to  prescription  drugs
    with some limited exceptions (although she  makes  that  point  in  the
    context of the risk of overdose and  inappropriate  medication  due  to
    lack of regulatory and professional control).    Medical  expenses  for
    conditions  most  likely  to  be  suffered  by  elderly  patients  have
    increased ([54] to [61] of the report).

41.  In terms of private  healthcare,  Dr  Holden  says  that  this  is  "an
    unaffordable option for lower- and middle-income  Pakistani  citizens".
    The other problem which Dr Holden  identifies  for  the  Appellants  is
    accessibility.  She says that the location of "the few reliable  health
    care institutions in cities like Islamabad,  Lahore  and  Karachi  will
    impact on the finances of the Appellants should they choose to live  in
    these cities".  Dr Holden also identifies concerns expressed about  the
    quality of service offered by a particular  hospital  (Shifa  Hospital)
    although I note that the footnotes in that regard date back  over  four
    to  five  years.   The  general  problem  is  one  of  corruption   and
    unprofessionalism ([62] to [66] of the report).

42.  Based on the evidence of Dr Woyka, Dr  Holden  identifies  a  potential
    need for the Second Appellant to be able to  access  mental  healthcare
    services in Pakistan.  She says that "[i]n the low- to  no-cost  public
    sector, psychological treatment  is  not  available  at  the  level  of
    primary health care services, from which patients are  supposed  to  be
    referred to specialized care at  secondary  and  tertiary  health  care
    facilities".  Only 0.4% of government health care budgets are  said  to
    be devoted to mental health  care  and  specialized  professionals  are
    "rare" ([68] of the report).  The statistics and reports relied upon at
    [69] of the report are somewhat dated to be of any  assistance  (dating
    from 2009 and 2014/15).   Dr Holden says that "[t]o the best  of  [her]
    knowledge there are no  primary  public  sector  health  services  that
    provide specialized psychological treatment on an  out-patient  basis".
    She also says that there are "very few low- to  no-cost  public  sector
    preventative  or  symptomatic  home-  or  community-based   out-patient
    psychological support services available" ([72]  of  the  report).   At
    [78] of the report, Dr Holden says that there is health care  available
    at a medium to high cost but that providers "are only rarely trained in
    psychology and mental health and generally speaking are  unprepared  to
    deal with the needs of unaccompanied or unassisted elderly".  Dr Holden
    points to the lack of specific geriatric care and a  negative  attitude
    of the public towards the elderly which she  says  lead  to  fragmented
    treatment depending on the medical need.   Finally, she says that there
    is a lack of understanding of dementia even among medical professionals
    in Pakistan.

43.  Dr Holden  identifies  at  [74]  to  [76]  of  the  report  the  stigma
    associated with mental illness and the sometimes "abusive  and  violent
    practices" adopted to deal with those illnesses.   She  picks  up  this
    theme again at [84] to [95] of the report.  At [86] of the report,  she
    says this:

         "For patients who experience and continue to experience any type or
         degree of mental health, even if mild,  and/or  are  identified  as
         having been diagnosed with a mental illness in Pakistan, there is a
         high risk that they will face a profound lack of social support  as
         well   as   social   isolation   and   financial    impoverishment.
         Specifically, patients diagnosed with  mental  illnesses  including
         emotional state due to stress, face a high degree of social  stigma
         and exclusion by kin, community  members,  potential  employers  as
         well  as  treating  healthcare  providers.   Exclusion   might   be
         especially exacerbated if the patients do not have senior male  kin
         to take care of them or support from their families."

    The  sources  of  that  comment  are  somewhat  dated  (from  2014   or
    thereabouts) or are no longer available.  In any event, as I will  come
    to, the relevance of it to the Second  Appellant's  situation  depends,
    first, on the support available to her in Pakistan and, second, on  her
    need for mental healthcare.  Dr Holden says that there  is  a  lack  of
    understanding of dementia in Pakistan and therefore few care facilities
    available.

44.  Dr Holden was asked specifically to deal with the  possibility  of  the
    Appellants returning to live at Makkah Colony, Lahore where they  lived
    in the past.  The property where they lived is apparently owned by  the
    Second Appellant's sister who is said to be reluctant to allow them  to
    live there again due to their illnesses.  That is consistent with  what
    Fawad Qamar told the independent social worker (see  below).   Even  if
    they were able to live there, Dr Holden says that the living conditions
    in Makkah Colony are unfavourable to the Appellants.  In short summary,
    she says that the Colony is in a densely populated  area  with  limited
    green space, is overcrowded and suffers from poor management.  She also
    says that there is a high level of crime.

45.  In terms of the Appellants' financial  circumstances,  Dr  Holden  says
    that the pension to which the First Appellant is entitled is below what
    is judged to be the minimum amount for a healthy life in Pakistan.   Dr
    Holden says that this  amount  would  be  insufficient  to  enable  the
    Appellants to return to Makkah Colony even if they  wished  to  do  so.
    That does not of course take account  of  what  financial  support  the
    Appellants' family in the UK may be able to offer.

46.  The Appellants say in their letter that they  don't  have  a  permanent
    home or close family members  in  Pakistan.   They  say  that  "due  to
    [their] age it is very tiring and difficult to live in Pakistan".  That
    assertion is based on the difficulty of long-haul  travel  and  finding
    accommodation.

47.  Dr Holden's conclusions at [106] onwards of  the  report  work  on  the
    assumption that the Appellants will have  insufficient  economic  means
    and a lack of family support.  Although I have dealt with  Dr  Holden's
    report in some detail and I  do  not  doubt  either  her  integrity  or
    expertise, it appears that Dr Holden was not told, as  I  was  in  oral
    evidence, that if the Appellants were returned to Pakistan, one of  the
    Appellants' sons would return with them.  I was told by the Appellants'
    sons in oral evidence that the  possibility  of  the  Second  Appellant
    going to live in a care home was inconceivable for them,  whether  that
    was in the UK or Pakistan.  In either  event,  they  said,  the  family
    would take care of the Second Appellant itself.  Fawad Qamar also  told
    me that the family could pay for whatever  treatment  was  required  in
    Pakistan.  Syed Ali told me that "it was not about money, it was  about
    care".  He also said that his wife works full-time.  Fawad's wife helps
    out but "if they needed help, they would get it if that was  required".



48.   To  some  extent,  therefore,  leaving  aside  the  medical  treatment
    available in Pakistan, the Appellants would have  a  similar  level  of
    family support in Pakistan.  That would alleviate some of the  problems
    of stigmatisation and cost which Dr Holden identifies  in  her  report.
    It would however also have implications for the Appellants'  family  in
    the UK.  That therefore leads me to consider the evidence regarding the
    impact of removal on both the Appellants and their family in the UK.

Impact of Removal

49.  Reliance is placed in this regard on the report of  Mr  Peter  Horrocks
    (at [AB2/1-23]).  Mr Horrocks is  an  independent  social  worker.   He
    qualified as a social worker in 1988 and has worked as a social worker,
    team  manager  and  senior  manager  in  statutory  and   non-statutory
    settings.  His CV shows that he has experience  working  with  children
    and vulnerable adults.  He has worked  with  many  nationalities.   His
    report is dated  12  October  2019  and  follows  interviews  with  the
    Appellants and two of their sons in September 2019.

50.   The information given to Mr  Horrocks  by  Fawad  Qamar  is  that  the
    Appellants used their maternal aunt's property (I assume  the  property
    in Makkah Colony) as a stop gap between visits  to  the  UK  and  Dubai
    having sold their own house.  Fawad told Mr Horrocks that this property
    remained available to them but that the aunt would no  longer  let  the
    Appellants live there due to their additional  needs.   The  Appellants
    cannot live with their son in Dubai "because  of  issues  around  legal
    status".  I  was  told  by  Fawad  that  in  fact  the  family  of  the
    Appellants' son in Dubai has returned to Pakistan as he has a different
    job from his previous employment and his situation in Dubai is now more
    precarious.  Syed Ali confirmed to Mr Horrocks that the  wife  and  two
    eldest daughters of the son living in Dubai have returned  to  Pakistan
    "for educational reasons".  They are living with the wife's  family  in
    Pakistan.   I accept that evidence and that the Appellants could not go
    to live in Dubai.

51.  Fawad told Mr Horrocks  that  the  First  Appellant  "has  no  specific
    health issues" but due to general health problems associated  with  old
    age  he  is  no  longer  able  to  look  after  the  Second  Appellant,
    particularly given her decreasing mobility.  Mention is again  made  of
    the Second Appellant being in a wheelchair.   Fawad  told  Mr  Horrocks
    that the Second Appellant has been  in  a  wheelchair  for  five  years
    because of "spinal weakness and  knee  problems".   The  major  problem
    however is said to be her dementia which makes travel very difficult.

52.  The Appellants live with Syed Ali.  He told Mr Horrocks that the  First
    Appellant does not require personal assistance with self-care but,  due
    to his cultural background, is  unused  to  running  a  household.   As
    already noted, he is said to be unable to assist the  Second  Appellant
    with her mobility issues.  In terms of assistance needed by the  Second
    Appellant, she is able to walk to the toilet unaided by holding herself
    against the walls and has bath rails to assist with  bathing.   She  is
    said to be able  to  meet  her  own  self-care  "in  a  controlled  and
    monitored environment" but is unable to perform household  tasks.   She
    cannot go out unassisted.   She  also  needs  help  to  attend  medical
    appointments and is apt to forget to take her medication or to remember
    that she has  already  taken  it.   Notwithstanding  her  deteriorating
    memory, she is said to be "happy and relaxed" with  when  her  children
    and their families.  The same is said of the First Appellant.

53.  Syed told Mr Horrocks that "the reasons for [the  Appellants]  to  stay
    here in the UK are basically because they don't have  anywhere  to  go.
    Their care needs have increased significantly since previous visits and
    they are  no  longer  able  to  live  independently  and  to  care  for
    themselves".  It is "no longer viable or possible" for  the  Appellants
    to live as  they  used  to  by  travelling  between  Pakistan  and  the
    UK/Dubai.

54.  As I have already observed, I was told by the  Appellants'  three  sons
    in oral evidence that, if the Appellants were returned to Pakistan, one
    of the sons and their family would return.  In terms of impact  on  the
    families, Mr Horrocks records at [3.13] of his report that Fawad  Qamar
    runs his own business and Syed and Fahim Ali  run  their  own  business
    together.  At the time  of  Mr  Horrocks'  report,  Fahim  Ali  had  an
    "entrepreneurial visa" (I assume Tier 1 Migrant visa) and had been here
    for nine years.  His  return  to  Pakistan  would  involve  losing  his
    investment.  It is not said whether the  business  could  be  run  from
    outside the UK. The other sons have children  of  school  age  who  are
    therefore in education in the UK.

55.  Mr Horrocks sums up the situation for  the  Appellants  in  the  UK  at
    [4.2] to [4.8] of the report culminating in the following summary:

         "4.8 The current situation is that the quality of life  enjoyed  by
         this elderly couple is good.  Their practical care needs are  being
         met and as Mrs  Qamar's  dementia  increasingly  deteriorates,  her
         situation is monitored and she accesses the additional support  she
         requires.  The current situation means that this elderly couple  do
         not have to worry about any aspect of their practical care and they
         can enjoy the time they spend with their sons and grandchildren and
         this in turn is beneficial for their emotional well-being.   During
         the period that they have lived in the UK the  couple  have  become
         increasingly frail and dependent, but the presence of their  family
         around to provide  them  with  care  has  ensured  that  under  the
         circumstances they have been able to enjoy as  good  a  quality  of
         life as could be expected.  Since they gave up  their  family  home
         their lives have revolved around spending time with their sons  and
         families.  They have now lived with Syed  and  his  family  and  in
         close proximity to their two other sons and their  families  for  a
         period of nearly  one  and  a  half  years  and  they  have  become
         emotionally reliant on the presence of their loved  ones  in  their
         day to day lives.  The presence of their sons, daughter in laws and
         grandchildren have provide them with emotional support and provided
         some counter-balance to the impact  their  increasing  frailty  and
         vulnerability has on their lives.  The families provide  them  with
         social interaction, with [sic] occupies  much  of  their  time  and
         interests."

56.  Mr Horrocks goes on to  consider  the  impact  if  the  Appellants  are
    removed and their family remains living in the UK.  He says that  "this
    would have a profound and fundamental impact both  on  their  emotional
    well-being as well as their practical care needs".  He says  that  they
    would have to make alternative living arrangements, lack  the  capacity
    to run their own household and to meet their own care needs.  I do  not
    need to dwell on the care aspect as  Dr  Horton  has  dealt  with  this
    scenario in more depth in her report and she has  a  greater  expertise
    regarding the situation in  Pakistan.   Mr  Horrocks  anticipates  that
    removal would  lead  to  a  downturn  in,  in  particular,  the  Second
    Appellant's mental health if she were  forced  to  depend  on  external
    carers.  Mr Horrocks says that the alternative option  of  one  of  the
    Appellants' three sons going with them is "not viable".   This  appears
    to be for business reasons and because of their  family  circumstances.
    There is no consideration why two of the brothers  could  not  continue
    the business in the absence of one or whether the brother who  returned
    could continue to be involved remotely from Pakistan.  I  consider  the
    impact on the families below.

57.  Mr Horrocks recognises in the section which follows  the  stress  which
    is put on  a  relationship  by  caring  for  a  parent  with  dementia.
    However, in this instance, it is his opinion that the  relationship  is
    improved.  The three daughter-in-laws are  said  to  work  together  to
    provide support.  If the Appellants  remain  in  the  UK,  Mr  Horrocks
    envisages that care would continue to be provided in that way.  That is
    consistent with the evidence I heard from the Appellants' sons that the
    family would not countenance the possibility of  the  Second  Appellant
    going into a care home.

58.  In conclusion, Mr Horrocks recommends that the Appellants be  permitted
    to remain in the UK.  He opines that it would be in the best  interests
    of both the Appellants and their family members in the UK.

59.  I have already referred to the  Appellants'  evidence  that  they  feel
    "more comfortable and mentally satisfied" living with their  family  in
    the UK.  They say that they have also enjoyed  festivals  during  their
    stay.  They say that their sons want them to stay in the  UK  and  that
    they "also feel like staying here  without  the  restriction  to  leave
    every 6 months".  They ask for permission to stay "without  the  hassle
    of travelling" and reiterate the evidence I heard from their sons  that
    they have not and will not rely  on  public  funds  including  publicly
    funded medical treatment.

60.  I have dealt within my consideration of the evidence  above  with  what
    is said by the Appellants' three sons about the Appellants' care in the
    UK.  I have also referred to the oral evidence that, if the  Appellants
    were returned to Pakistan, one of the families would return with  them.
    I was told that no decision had yet been taken about which of the  sons
    would return.  Of the three sons, only one  (Syed  Ali)  is  a  British
    citizen.  The other two sons have indefinite  leave  to  remain.   One,
    Fahim, is living with Syed Ali, his family and the Appellants.  He  has
    been in the UK since 2007.  The other son, Fawad Qamar has lived in the
    UK since 2009.  He does not live with the Appellants but  has  given  a
    more detailed account of their care needs than his  brothers  (see  his
    statement at [AB3/3-6]).  His wife and one of his  children  have  also
    provided statements/letter at [AB3/7-9].   He  said  in  oral  evidence
    that he was running a business here and his children are settled  here.
    They have strong ties to the UK although he did also say that  he  goes
    to Pakistan occasionally.  His in-laws live there.

61.  Fahim Ali also confirmed that  his  mother-in-law  lives  in  Pakistan.
    His wife is from Pakistan.  They  were  unable  to  visit  the  country
    whilst his immigration status was being sorted out, but they visited in
    2019 prior to the pandemic  and  stayed  two  months.    He  gave  oral
    evidence about other relatives in  Pakistan.   The  Second  Appellant's
    sister remains in Pakistan.  She is younger than the Second  Appellant.
    She lives with her daughter.  Her son lives in the UK, but  Fahim  said
    that he was presently in Pakistan visiting his mother.   He  also  said
    that the First Appellant has a sister living in Rawalpindi who lives on
    her own there.  She is younger than the Appellants  (in  her  sixties).
    When asked whether the Appellants could go to live with  her,  he  said
    that they could not because she lives in a different city and "we  live
    in Lahore".

62.  All the Appellants' sons have children.   Fawad  Qamar's  children  are
    aged between thirteen years and eighteen months.  It may  be  that  the
    youngest  is  a  British  citizen  (depending  on  whether  Fawad   had
    indefinite leave when that  child  was  born).   There  is  however  no
    evidence that this is so.  The other children are citizens of Pakistan.
     The eldest would appear to have been born in  Pakistan  but  has  been
    here for over seven years.  The other children were born and have grown
    up here.  I have no evidence about the children other than  their  ages
    and that they must, because of their ages, with the  exception  of  the
    youngest child, be  in  formal  education  here.   I  do  however  have
    evidence  in  Fawad's  statement  that  those  children  have  a  close
    relationship with  the  Appellants.   The  children  speak  with  their
    grandparents every day.  During the pandemic, this has  been  remotely.
    The children talk to the Appellants in Urdu and are therefore  able  to
    communicate in that language.

63.  Syed Ali is a British citizen and has lived here since 2003.  His  most
    recent statement is at [AB3/10-11].  His wife's statement is at [AB3/12-
    13].  They have three children aged between three and  eight  years.  I
    have no evidence about them save that they  are  "deeply  attached"  to
    their  grandparents  and  vice  versa.   Syed's  wife  says  that   the
    Appellants play "a huge role" in their and  the  children's  lives.   I
    assume due to Syed's citizenship that the  children  also  are  British
    citizens.

64.  Fahim Ali's statement is at [AB3/14-15] and his wife's at  [AB3/16-17].
     They live with Syed Ali and his family.  They have two  children  aged
    three years and one year.  I do not know whether the younger of the two
    is a British  citizen.   That  would  depend  when  Fahim  was  granted
    indefinite leave to remain. Again, there is no evidence  that  this  is
    so.  Again, the Appellants are said to have  "a  huge  impact"  on  the
    children.

65.   The  Appellants'  sons  say  in  their  statements   that   they   run
    construction companies,  are  successful  and  in  a  strong  financial
    position.  I have referred to the evidence about the  company  at  [12]
    above.  I accept the evidence that they have paid for  the  Appellants'
    medical needs throughout.  The only recourse that the  Appellants  have
    had to the NHS is the taking of the Covid-19 vaccination which was  not
    available via private healthcare.  I also accept  their  evidence  that
    they  could  afford  to  continue  to  maintain  and  accommodate   the
    Appellants in the UK without recourse to public funds.

DISCUSSION

66.  I begin with Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  The Appellants are nationals  of
    Pakistan.  Over the past eight years,  they  have  divided  their  time
    between the UK and Dubai, returning to Pakistan  only  between  visits.
    They sold their permanent home  there  in  2010.   However,  they  have
    lived, worked and brought up family in  that  country  for  over  sixty
    years of their lives.  Indeed, it  appears  from  the  Appellants'  own
    evidence that, even now,  they  are  not  unduly  concerned  about  the
    prospect of life in Pakistan.  Their concerns are that they  would  not
    be able to continue their travel as they have done in recent years  and
    therefore would be separated from their family in the  UK.  They  speak
    the language of Pakistan.  They do not speak English.   They  would  of
    course have to find a home to live  in  whether  purchased  or  rented.
    However, their sons are financially secure and have made clear in their
    evidence that they would continue to support the Appellants if they had
    to return.  The foregoing are all factors relevant to  the  test  which
    applies.   Having  regard  to  what  was  said  in  Kamara,  it  cannot
    realistically be argued that  the  Appellants  are  not  "insiders"  in
    Pakistan.  They are clearly  culturally  assimilated.   They  are  very
    familiar with the way in which society works in Pakistan.

67.  I have considered  whether  it  could  be  said  that  the  Appellants'
    medical conditions affect their ability  to  participate  in  Pakistani
    society.  There is a suggestion in the medical evidence that the  First
    Appellant's lung problems  were  exacerbated  by  the  air  quality  in
    Pakistan and that his breathlessness would deteriorate if returned.   I
    am not however entirely clear what specialist knowledge Dr Wokya has in
    that regard and the First Appellant does not say that  the  climate  in
    Pakistan has been an undue problem for him in the past.  It is fair  to
    observe that the Appellants' health case is focussed rather more on the
    Second Appellant's situation than that of the First Appellant.

68.  In relation to the Second Appellant, I have  considered  carefully  the
    evidence of Dr Holden  regarding  the  stigma  associated  with  mental
    health problems.  I am not entirely clear  from  the  medical  evidence
    whether  the  Second  Appellant's  depression  is  separate  from   her
    dementia, part of it and  caused  by  it  or  caused  by  the  lockdown
    restrictions during the pandemic.  It is suggested by Dr Wokya that the
    Second Appellant's mood "has deteriorated due to  lack  of  stimulation
    and requirement to be inside and lack of mobility which contributes  to
    this".  That would tend to suggest that it is the lockdown restrictions
    which have played the greater part in the deterioration of  the  Second
    Appellant's mental health.  There is however no evidence that this  has
    deteriorated to the extent of a formal diagnosis of depressive illness.
     It is not  clear  whether  the  Second  Appellant  is  in  receipt  of
    medication for depression but there is no  evidence  that  she  is  for
    example receiving counselling.

69.  I recognise that Dr Holden says in her report that there is a  lack  of
    understanding in relation to dementia and  it  may  well  be  that  the
    stigma which she says exists in respect of mental health  also  extends
    to those suffering from dementia.   However,  as  I  have  pointed  out
    above, the sources of her comments in this regard are  somewhat  dated.
    I cannot find based on Dr Holden's report that any stigma  is  of  such
    consequence for the Second  Appellant  that  it  would  impact  on  her
    ability to participate in society in Pakistan.

70.  Of course, the Second Appellant's condition itself and  her  associated
    mobility problems do limit her participation in society whether in  the
    UK or Pakistan.  It is not  however  a  very  significant  obstacle  to
    integration in Pakistan in and of itself.

71.  Having considered the factors which  may  be  said  to  impact  on  the
    Appellants' ability to integrate on return to Pakistan,  I  find  that,
    although it may be difficult for them initially to  reacclimatise,  for
    example to find accommodation and  rebuild  relationships  with  family
    members and friends there, the obstacles which they would  face  cannot
    be described as very significant.

72.  For those reasons, the Appellants do not satisfy Paragraph  276ADE  (1)
    (vi).

73.  I move on then to consider Article 8 outside  the  Rules.   As  I  have
    already noted, although the Appellants  are  unable  to  meet  the  ADR
    Rules, it is instructive to consider the extent  to  which  they  might
    have been able to do so if  they  were  making  this  application  from
    outside the UK and therefore satisfied the status requirement.

74.  The first consideration is whether  they  require  "long-term  personal
    care to  perform  everyday  tasks".   Although  the  First  Appellant's
    mobility is said to have deteriorated,  the  Appellants'  sons  do  not
    suggest that he requires assistance with his own personal care.   Fawad
    Qamar's evidence is that the First Appellant sometimes needs help  when
    he has problems with his back pain but when that is better "he does  it
    all be himself".  He is able to do light physical exercise albeit  only
    for short periods.

75.  The situation is however different for the Second Appellant.   She  has
    limited mobility and is confined to a wheelchair if  she  goes  out  so
    that she is unable to go out unaided.  Although the  evidence  is  that
    she is still able to carry out intimate personal care for herself  with
    some functional assistance, she is unable to carry out household  tasks
    like cooking and shopping. The reason why the  First  Appellant  cannot
    assist in the latter regard is cultural only as he has no idea  how  to
    do these things.  However, I accept  the  evidence  that  he  would  be
    unable to care for the Second Appellant unaided  as  his  own  mobility
    prevents him for example pushing her wheelchair.   I  accept  therefore
    that, if I were looking at the case through the lens of the ADR  Rules,
    the Second Appellant's situation would meet the first criteria.

76.  The second criteria  however  concerns  the  availability  of  care  in
    Pakistan.  The Appellants would have to show within the ADR Rules  that
    they would be "unable, even with the practical and  financial  help  of
    the sponsor, to obtain the required level of care in the country  where
    they [would be] living".  As was explained in Britcits, this  turns  on
    what is necessary and reasonable.

77.  I begin my consideration of this aspect with the report of  Dr  Holden.
    I accept her expertise.  I also accept her starting point that  in  the
    culture of Pakistan, it is expected that children will look after their
    elderly parents.  Indeed, this is clear from the  evidence  I  received
    from the Appellants' sons.  They would not wish to see their parents in
    a care home whether in the UK or Pakistan.

78.  I accept Dr Holden's evidence that, due to  the  cultural  expectations
    in Pakistan, there is less State provision for the elderly in  Pakistan
    than in the UK.  Even in the UK, it might be said that State  provision
    is not perfect.  However, I accept Dr Holden's evidence that there  are
    limited care facilities available.  On the other hand, she does not say
    that there are not  any.   She  has  provided  information  about  some
    medical outpatient care facilities and  some  accommodation  provision.
    She identifies one such home in  Lahore  specifically  for  those  with
    dementia.  Lahore is of course the home  area  of  the  Appellants  and
    their family.  The rates charged by that home compare  very  favourably
    with what would be charged in  the  UK.   The  evidence  given  by  the
    Appellants' sons is in any event that they are financially  secure  and
    would pay whatever was needed for their mother's care.   As  Dr  Holden
    says at [29] of her report, "the effectiveness of the home care service
    depends on the financial resources of the Appellant".

79.  It is perhaps in relation to affordability that I can give Dr  Holden's
    report less weight as she appears to be labouring under the  impression
    that the Appellants would fall within the low to medium income  bracket
    in Pakistan.  That may well be so based on  their  own  earnings  which
    come only from the First Appellant's pension.  However, that  does  not
    take into account the financial support which the Appellants'  sons  do
    and would continue to provide.  So, when it comes to domestic help, for
    example, the Appellants would be able to afford that.

80.  Similarly, and although not directly relevant to care, there  ought  to
    be no need for the Appellants to enter sheltered accommodation for  the
    elderly if they can pay for domestic care.  Their  sons  could  rent  a
    property for them.  Although I do not have  evidence  from  the  Second
    Appellant's sister supporting the assertion that she  would  not  allow
    the Appellants to live in her property in  Makkah  Colony,  it  appears
    from Dr Holden's report that this is not  an  ideal  location  for  the
    Appellants to live in any event.  There is however no  reason  why  the
    Appellants' sons could not fund a rental property.  It may be the  case
    that they could even buy the Appellants a family home.

81.  In terms of medical treatment, the Appellants  are  prescribed  various
    medications.  I was not told that any of these  are  not  available  in
    Pakistan.  Many of the Appellants' medical  conditions  pre-date  their
    arrival in the UK and they must therefore have been in receipt of those
    medications in Pakistan.  Dr Holden says, by way of a  criticism,  that
    prescription medicines in Pakistan are freely available and unregulated
    but, conversely, that suggests that there is no difficulty in obtaining
    medication which is required.   In  any  event,  as  I  understand  the
    medical evidence, particularly that of Dr Roche who  made  the  initial
    diagnosis of vascular dementia, medication is  unlikely  to  assist  in
    this regard (although  I  understand  that  the  Appellants  both  need
    medication for other  more  long-standing  conditions  which  I  assume
    therefore that they could obtain in Pakistan).

82.  I do not place any weight on what Dr Holden says about availability  of
    mental health  services  in  Pakistan  for  two  reasons.   First,  and
    fundamentally, there is no evidence that the Second Appellant has  been
    referred for specialist treatment of mental health problems in  the  UK
    (other than in  relation  to  her  dementia  which  has  been  reviewed
    intermittently including on previous visits to the UK).  Second, and in
    any event, Dr Holden again appears to assume that the Appellants  would
    not be able to afford to pay privately if the Second Appellant did need
    such care.  As such, her comments about the problems  inherent  in  the
    public health system are not relevant.

83.  I  accept  that  the  Appellants'  sons  and  probably  the  Appellants
    themselves would be reluctant to turn to  care  homes  to  provide  the
    necessary  care  for  the  Second  Appellant.   Whilst  that  might  be
    culturally unsatisfactory, I do not find that it is  unreasonable.   In
    any event, the Appellants could turn to live-in domestic care to assist
    them.

84.  The above is somewhat hypothetical in any event since  the  Appellants'
    sons made very clear that it would be their intention for  one  of  the
    families to return to Pakistan with the  Appellants  were  they  to  be
    returned.  As such, the support and care  which  the  Second  Appellant
    receives from her family in the UK would be effectively  replicated.  I
    come to the proportionality and reasonableness of  that  course  below.
    However, in light of the evidence before me, I am unable to accept that
    there is not care available to the Appellants (particularly the  Second
    Appellant) to assist with their care needs in Pakistan.

85.  If I were considering this case within the ADR  Rules,  therefore,  the
    Appellants would fail.  I accept that this is not the way in which  the
    case has been argued.  Mr Jones did not make any  submission  that  the
    Appellants would inevitably meet the ADR Rules if  they  were  applying
    from outside the UK.  The Appellants' case is  rather  that,  balancing
    the impact of removal on family and private  life  against  the  public
    interest, removal would  be  disproportionate.   I  turn  therefore  to
    consider that case.

86.  I accept that the Appellants enjoy family life with their children  and
    their children's families in the UK.  They live with two of their  sons
    and their  families.   They  clearly  have  a  financial  and  physical
    dependence on their sons  and  daughter-in-laws.   They  have  a  close
    relationship with  their  grandchildren.   Notwithstanding  that  their
    children are adults therefore I accept that the relationship is one  of
    family life.  That is important since I must  consider  the  impact  of
    removal not only on the Appellants but also on their family.

87.  Before I turn to  consider  that  impact,  it  is  appropriate  to  say
    something about the  Appellants'  private  lives.   The  focus  of  the
    submissions made to me is, for understandable reasons, the family  life
    which they enjoy. However, I do not find that there is any  significant
    interference with the Appellants' private lives save as  regards  their
    medical care.  There is no evidence that they have  integrated  in  the
    UK.  They do not speak English.   They  have  been  largely  housebound
    since arriving in the UK on the last occasion due to the  pandemic  but
    there is no evidence that their social circle is any wider  than  their
    sons and their sons' families.   Section 117B (5) requires me  to  give
    little weight to a private life formed whilst in the UK on a precarious
    basis as is the case here.  Whilst the weight to be given is  variable,
    in this case I do give the interference with  the  Appellants'  private
    lives in terms of their social  relationships  and  integration  little
    weight due to the lack of evidence about those private lives.

88.  The main focus in relation to their private lives is  the  interference
    with the care which they receive and the impact  of  removal  on  their
    medical conditions.

89.  It is not suggested that the  impact  of  removal  on  the  Appellants'
    health would breach Article 3 ECHR nor could it be on the evidence  for
    the reasons I have already explained when looking at  the  availability
    of care in the context of obstacles to integration and the ADR Rules.

90.  I accept, however, that the impact is also relevant to  the  Article  8
    balance whether that is by reference to the effect on private lives  or
    family life if there is some other element of Article 8 which  applies.
    I have already made  the  point  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  the
    Appellants' integration in the UK  or  relationships  which  they  have
    formed here which fall within the paradigm of private life.

91.  The position is however  different  in  relation  to  family  life.   I
    accept that there is evidence that the  Appellants  have  a  close  and
    strong relationship with both their adult children and  the  wives  and
    children  of  those  children.   That  is  a  reciprocal   relationship
    reinforced by the care which the Appellants' family give.

92.   Although  I  have  limited  information  about  the  children  of  the
    Appellants' sons, there was no challenge to  the  evidence  that  those
    minor children are very close to their grandparents who, no  doubt,  so
    far as their medical conditions permit, look after those  children.   I
    am of course bound to treat the best interests of those minor  children
    as a primary although not a paramount  consideration.   In  this  case,
    however, despite what I say about the closeness  of  the  relationship,
    there is limited if any evidence about the impact which  removal  would
    have on those children.  I would expect  them  to  be  upset  if  their
    grandparents were to return to Pakistan but, ultimately,  the  children
    are either of an age where they depend entirely on  their  parents  who
    would still be here to care for them or where they  are  forming  their
    own friendships outside the family unit which they  would  be  able  to
    continue.  I can therefore give little weight to the best interests  of
    the children.

93.  I have already mentioned several times the evidence of the  Appellants'
    sons that if the Appellants were removed, one of  them  would  move  to
    Pakistan to look after the Appellants.  I am  unable  to  consider  the
    impact of that option however in the absence of evidence about which of
    the sons would go and what that would mean for their family.  All three
    sons have their own minor children and therefore some of those children
    would be impacted if their parents were to return to  Pakistan.   There
    is however some difference between, for example, Fahim Ali and his wife
    and children relocating and Syed Ali doing  so.   Fahim  has  two  very
    young children.  The youngest might be a British citizen  depending  on
    Fahim's status when that child was born but both are  young  enough  to
    become accustomed to Pakistan.  Fahim said  that  he  had  returned  to
    Pakistan with his wife (and presumably his eldest child) for two months
    in 2019.  His wife's parents live in Pakistan.  I accept that Fahim has
    been in the UK since 2007 and has a successful business in the UK but I
    have no information why he could not continue to  participate  in  that
    business from abroad.

94.  By contrast, Syed Ali has older children who have lived in the  UK  for
    most of their lives or were born here.  They are I assume British.  Two
    at least are  in  formal  education  and  have  been  for  many  years.
    Clearly, the uprooting of those children would have  a  greater  impact
    than would be  the  case  for  two  very  young  children  not  yet  in
    education.

95.  However, I find that I do not  need  to  consider  this  option  within
    Article 8 as, if one of the Appellants' sons did decide to go with  the
    Appellants, that would be as a matter of  choice  (albeit  an  enforced
    one) and not directly as a result of the removal of the Appellants.

96.  I therefore consider the impact of  removal  on  the  basis  that  this
    would lead to the  separation  of  the  Appellants  from  their  family
    members.  I accept that this would be very upsetting for all concerned.
     I accept Mr Horrocks' evidence about the  impact  on  the  Appellants'
    emotional well-being although, as I have said, there may be less impact
    on their care needs than he envisages due to the availability  of  care
    facilities in Pakistan.  I have also accepted that there might be  some
    initial obstacles at least to be faced in Pakistan and  of  course,  if
    one of the Appellants' sons did not go with the Appellants, they  would
    have to find a carer for the Second Appellant.

97.  I do not propose to repeat what I have already said  about  the  impact
    of removal on the Appellants' medical conditions.  I accept that  there
    may  well  be  some  impact  but  that  can  be  mitigated  by  finding
    appropriate care if one of the Appellants'  sons  and  family  did  not
    relocate.  As Ms Cunha pointed out, one of the sons might not  need  to
    relocate permanently but merely in the short-term in  order  to  settle
    the Appellants back in Pakistan,  find  accommodation  and  appropriate
    care.  Thereafter, family life could be continued by regular visits  of
    the Appellants' sons and their families to  their  parents.   I  accept
    that the impact would be harsh for all concerned but the issue  for  me
    is whether that harshness is justified when balanced against the public
    interest in removal.

98.  I therefore turn to consider the public interest.  It was suggested  to
    me by Mr Jones that there is, in reality, no  public  interest  in  the
    removal of the Appellants.  They made their application  to  remain  in
    time whilst they still had leave to be in the UK as  visitors.   Unlike
    in the case of Mobeen to which I have made  reference,  the  Appellants
    are not overstayers.  However, that is by reason of having  made  their
    application within time and having appealed the refusal of leave.  They
    had leave to remain only for a period of six months and  were  expected
    to return to Pakistan at the end of that period.  I do  not  doubt  the
    evidence that this was their intention when they came  to  the  UK  and
    were persuaded by their sons to make the application to remain  because
    of the Second Appellant's deteriorating condition.

99.  Nonetheless, the fact remains that the  Appellants  have  no  basis  to
    remain within the Rules.  For reasons I have  already  given,  if  this
    were an application under the ADR Rules, I would  have  concluded  that
    they could not satisfy the Rules.  There is a public  interest  in  not
    allowing those who have no basis of stay within the Rules to remain  in
    the UK.  Those Rules are intended to ensure fairness in immigration and
    are part of an effective immigration control system the maintenance  of
    which is in the public interest.

100. That brings me on to the public interest in the ADR  Rules  themselves.
    I accept the evidence that the Appellants' sons have and would continue
    to pay for the Appellants' medical treatment privately.  They are  able
    to accommodate and maintain the Appellants.  The  Respondent  does  not
    take issue with that evidence.

101. However, as was said in Britcits, there is a  further  public  interest
    inherent in  the  ADR  Rules  concerned  with  consistency  as  between
    applicants.  As the Court of Appeal put it in Britcits, the  ADR  Rules
    are "intended to  avoid  disparity  between  ADRs  depending  on  their
    wealth" so that only those who can show a real need to access  care  in
    the UK are permitted to stay.  In this case, I have found that  is  not
    the position.  The Appellants  can  receive  care  in  Pakistan.    The
    public  interest  in  preserving  a  consistent  position  as   between
    applicants is, I find, a strong one.

102. I therefore have to balance what I accept is  a  harsh  impact  on  the
    Appellants and their families against what I consider to  be  a  strong
    public interest in their removal.  Ultimately, the question is  whether
    the impact is "unjustifiably harsh".  That says no  more  than  whether
    the  decision  to  remove  is  disproportionate  when  interference  is
    balanced against public interest.

103. Although I accept that the balance is quite a fine one, I have  reached
    the conclusion that the consequence of the Appellants' removal  is  not
    unjustifiably harsh.  I add that I have every sympathy for the position
    in which the Appellants and their family find  themselves.   Whilst  it
    might reasonably have been expected that the situation  in  which  they
    now find themselves would come to pass as the Appellants grew older and
    their family migrated out of Pakistan,  I  accept  that  they  did  not
    orchestrate the current situation.  However, I have to apply the law to
    the facts and evidence.  Based on the legal position and even accepting
    the evidence which the Appellants have put  forward,  I  am  unable  to
    conclude that removal would in this case be disproportionate.

CONCLUSION

104. The decision to refuse  the  Appellants'  human  rights  claim  is  not
    contrary to section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.  Removal would  not
    breach the Appellants' human rights.  I therefore dismiss the  appeals.





DECISION

I dismiss the appeals.

basis

                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND

1.   The Appellants appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge I Ross promulgated on 29 November 2019 ("the Decision").  By  the
    Decision, the Judge  dismissed  the  Appellants'  appeals  against  the
    Respondent's decision dated  28  February  2019  refusing  their  human
    rights claims, made in the context of an application to remain  in  the
    UK with their adult children and the families of those children who are
    settled in the UK.  The Appellants are currently aged seventy-five  and
    seventy-one years respectively.  They pray in aid of their  application
    their ill health  and  their  relationships  with  their  children  and
    grandchildren.

2.    The  Judge  considered  the  Appellants'  cases   first   within   the
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules") in particular those  which  permit  the
    entry to the UK of adult dependent relatives.  It is not disputed  that
    the Appellants cannot meet those  Rules  not  least  because  they  are
    making their application from within the UK and not  from  abroad.  The
    Judge did not accept either that the  Appellants  can  meet  the  Rules
    relating to their private lives.  He did not accept that there are very
    significant obstacles to the Appellants' integration in Pakistan (under
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules).  The Appellants entered  the  UK
    last in July 2018 as visitors.  Finally, outside the Rules, whilst  the
    Judge accepted that there is family life  between  the  Appellants  and
    their  adult   children   (and   possibly   also   with   their   minor
    grandchildren), he concluded that the decision to remove the Appellants
    was proportionate.

3.   The Appellants appeal on three grounds as follows:

    Ground 1: Adequacy of reasons and failure to consider  material  issues
    and evidence.

    Ground 2: As a result, the  Judge's  finding  as  to  very  significant
    obstacles is flawed.

    Ground 3: As a result, the Judge's finding that it is not unjustifiably
    harsh for the Appellants to return to Pakistan is also flawed.

4.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Fisher
    on 24 April 2020 as follows (so far as relevant):

         "... 2.  The grounds seeking permission assert that the Judge erred
         in failing to make adequate findings on the evidence. Specifically,
         it is said that he failed to make findings on the  availability  of
         family in Pakistan to support the elderly Appellants on return,  on
         the first Appellant's ability to care for his wife  in  that  event
         and on the potential impact on the sponsor and his family having to
         relocate to Pakistan to care for the  Appellants.   It  is  further
         said that he failed to consider the best interests of the children,
         and that he failed to mention the background evidence on healthcare
         or the independent social worker's report.  The grounds  go  on  to
         challenge the Judge's findings on very significant obstacles  under
         Paragraph 276ADE and on Article 8 issues outside the Rules.

         3.   It is arguable that the Judge has erred  in  failing  to  make
         findings on relevant issues in the appeal.  His failure to  mention
         the best interests of the children in assessing proportionality, or
         to deal specifically with the  expert  report  and  the  background
         evidence, are also arguable errors which  infect  his  findings  on
         Paragraph 276ADE as well as Article 8 outside the Rules.

         4.   Consequently, I grant permission to appeal.  All  grounds  are
         arguable."

5.   The matter comes before me to determine whether the  Decision  contains
    an error of law and, if I so conclude, to either re-make  the  decision
    or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

6.   Notice of the hearing before me was sent to  the  parties  on  16  July
    2020 indicating that the hearing would be conducted remotely via  Skype
    for Business given the current  restrictions  caused  by  the  Covid-19
    pandemic.  Neither party objected to that course.

7.   An application to adjourn the hearing  due  to  the  unavailability  of
    Counsel who has represented the  Appellants  to  date  (Mr  Jones)  was
    refused  by  the  Tribunal  lawyer  and  by  me  following  a   review.
    Fortunately, the Appellants were able to find alternative  Counsel.   I
    am grateful to Mr Lay for taking on the appeals at short notice and for
    his very helpful submissions and skeleton argument.

8.   Other than a very minor technical issue at the outset of  the  hearing,
    which was swiftly resolved, there were no other technical  issues  with
    the remote hearing and both parties confirmed that they  were  able  to
    follow the hearing throughout.   I had  before  me  Mr  Lay's  skeleton
    argument, as well as Mr Jones' skeleton argument  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing, a  bundle  and  supplementary  bundle  filed  by  the
    Appellants in the First-tier Tribunal as well as a few sundry documents
    and the Respondent's bundle.  I do not need to refer to  the  substance
    of those documents in what follows but I have read them.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

9.   Mr Lay focussed his submissions on  what  he  said  were  the  starkest
    errors, namely the failure to deal with the children's  best  interests
    or the social worker's report.  That latter is a  report  of  Mr  Peter
    Horrocks which is at [ABS/1-24].  In this case, that report  deals  not
    only with the children affected by the appeals (namely the  Appellants'
    grandchildren) but also the  social  care  aspects  of  the  cases,  in
    particular that of the  Second  Appellant  who  suffers  from  dementia
    (amongst other conditions) and the ability of the  First  Appellant  to
    care for her.

10.  Those failures form  part  of  the  Appellants'  ground  one  and  have
    implications in relation to ground three (in relation to the children's
    best interests) and ground two (in relation to the obstacles which  the
    Appellants would face on return to Pakistan if forcibly  removed  based
    on what is said in Mr Horrocks' report).

11.  Taking first the children's best interests, Mr Lay submitted  that  the
    Judge's approach is muddled.  He drew my attention to [28] and [29]  of
    the Decision which read as follows:

         "28. Whilst I am satisfied that there is family  life  between  the
         appellants and their adult children in  the  UK,  the  question  is
         whether the refusals are proportionate.  The appellants came to the
         UK as visitors with six-month visit visas.  They and  their  family
         chose not to apply from  Pakistan  for  entry  clearance  as  adult
         dependent relatives.

         29.  I have had regard to the section 117B factors.  There  was  no
         evidence that the appellants can speak English, although  I  accept
         that they  are  financially  independent.   Little  weight  can  be
         afforded to their private lives given that their immigration status
         has always been precarious.  Their family life together as a couple
         can continue in Pakistan and their relationship with their children
         and grandchildren can continue uninterrupted, given that  they  are
         used to travelling between Pakistan, Dubai and the United Kingdom."

12.  The Judge there accepts that family life exists between the  Appellants
    and their adult children (having regard to what is said in  Kugathas  v
    Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2003]  EWCA  Civ  31).
    However, the Judge does not state whether it  is  accepted  that  there
    exists family life between  the  Appellants  and  their  grandchildren.
    Perhaps as a result, the Judge has failed to make any finding as to the
    children's best interests (as Ms Cunha accepted).

13.  As regards Mr Horrocks' report, Mr Lay accepted that  the  Judge  could
    give less weight to that report or find that it was not consistent with
    the other medical evidence if that was his view.  However, as Ms  Cunha
    again accepted, there is no reference at all to the report.

14.  Ms Cunha's response to those submissions is that there are errors,  but
    they are not material.

15.  Dealing first with Mr Horrocks' report, Ms Cunha pointed out  that,  at
    [21] of the Decision, the Judge has set out the medical evidence  which
    forms a large part of the obstacles which are said to exist  on  return
    to Pakistan.  The issue  before  the  Judge  was  whether  the  medical
    conditions amounted to very significant  obstacles  to  integration  in
    Pakistan.  The  Judge  deals  with  that  submission  at  [26]  of  the
    Decision, having recorded the content of the medical evidence  at  [18]
    to [21] of the Decision and set out  his  findings  about  the  medical
    conditions at [23] as follows:

         "18. The medical evidence  in  relation  to  the  second  appellant
         (mother) is contained in a  letter  from  The  Harrow  Health  Care
         Centre dated 1 November  2019.   It  confirms  that  she  has  been
         attending  there  since  October  2015  and  has   been   seen   on
         approximately 20 occasions.  She has Type  II  diabetes  -  long  -
         standing; hypertension - long- standing; cognitive impairment onset
         June 2016.  The  effect  of  the  cognitive  impairment  is  memory
         dysfunction, which is increasing, and she  has  been  treated  with
         drugs used for Alzheimer's.  Her mood is good, she is compliant but
         requires supervision within the home and is increasingly  reluctant
         to leave the house or to go walking, which is now having an  impact
         on her mobility and activity.  She has six monthly reviews and  her
         blood tests are generally very satisfactory.

         19.  The doctor has stated that the second appellant needs constant
         supervision in order to remain safe.  She is always brought by  her
         son and would be unable to negotiate her way through obtaining  the
         appropriate medical care.  She is now walking quite slowly  due  to
         increasing immobility.  She needs her meals provided and  help  and
         support his daily  tasks.   When  going  out  she  now  requires  a
         wheelchair as she is unable to walk more than 500m without becoming
         fatigued.  She has a  medical  condition  which  will  continue  to
         decline, and she will require increasing levels of supervision with
         daily tasks such as eating,  dressing,  washing-all  of  which  are
         currently being provided by her supportive family.  She needs  one-
         to-one supervision should she be required to travel by air.

         20.  Another letter from Dr Roche dated 30 January 2019 states that
         the second appellant's main issues are with their short-term memory
         names and repetition.  She can be irritable at times, but there  is
         no evidence of underlying depressive disorder.   He  suspects  that
         she has got vascular dementia and that medication may not help.

         21.  In relation to the first appellant (father) there  is  also  a
         letter from The Harrow Health Care Centre dated  1  November  2019.
         His current medical conditions are sciatica which has improved with
         time, rest and  anti-inflammatories.   He  has  had  emphysema  and
         bronchiectasis some considerable time.  He gave a history of having
         significant breathing difficulties whilst being in  Pakistan  which
         is attributed to impure air quality.   He  has  had  a  variety  of
         inhalers prescribed for him and has had  3  consultations  here  in
         respect of his breathing issues.  He has significant restriction on
         lung function,  which  makes  him  short  of  breath  on  exertion,
         although not at rest and makes him susceptible to  recurrent  chest
         infection.  He is a lifelong non-smoker and his emphysema thus must
         have  been  caused  by  other  toxic   air   components   and   his
         bronchiectasis will make him susceptible to recurrent infection  in
         addition.  He will require long-term use  of  inhalers  and  rescue
         antibiotics as required.  His respiratory function is significantly
         compromised by factors such as cold weather.  Poor air quality will
         provoke episodes of breathing disorders comparable to asthma.  This
         is an irreversible condition and likely to  deteriorate  with  age.
         It is likely from his history, that  his  lung  condition  will  be
         further adversely affected should he return to Pakistan.  His other
         health is excellent, his mental function is good he is  active  and
         fit in other respects.  His lung function however is  significantly
         impaired which would make it hard to provide the  physical  support
         required by his wife.  In the  doctor's  opinion,  both  appellants
         would suffer significant deterioration in their health should  they
         be required to live alone together in  Pakistan.   They  both  need
         support and help of  their  family  as  they  both  have  long-term
         irreversible medical conditions.

         ...

         23.   Whilst  the  medical  evidence  in  relation  to  the  second
         appellant  is  that  she  will   require   increasing   levels   of
         supervision, the specified evidence required under Appendix  FM  34
         is absent.  I am not satisfied that either appellant cannot perform
         everyday tasks.  Further, there is no independent evidence that the
         appellants are unable, even with the practical and  financial  help
         of the sponsor in the UK to obtain the required level  of  care  in
         Pakistan.  Such evidence should be from (a) a central local  health
         authority; (b) a local authority; or (c) a doctor or  other  health
         professional.  The appellants are also required  to  show  why  any
         private arrangements for their care are no longer available.

         ...

         26.  I find that  it  has  not  been  shown  that  there  are  very
         significant obstacles to the appellant's integration  in  Pakistan.
         They are nationals of that county and have lived there all of their
         long lives, notwithstanding that they are able to travel abroad  to
         Dubai and the UK for parts of  the  year.   Whilst  the  levels  of
         pollution may be high in the part  Pakistan  where  the  appellants
         come from (there is no independent objective evidence  in  relation
         to that), I do not accept that living  in  Pakistan  of  itself  is
         detrimental or damaging to the appellants' health.  The appellants,
         with the help of their family members can choose where in  Pakistan
         to live, which could include areas with much cleaner air  and  less
         pollution."

16.  Ms Cunha drew my attention to the Court of  Appeal's  judgment  in  the
    case of Lal v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 1925  regarding  the  need  to  look  at  the  position  throughout
    Pakistan.  I accept that  the  Judge  was  entitled  to  consider  that
    particular aspect in the way he did.

17.  The difficulty with the Judge's findings in this regard though  is  the
    failure to consider the care which the Second Appellant, in particular,
    may need on return to Pakistan through the lens of  whether  there  are
    very significant obstacles to integration.  His findings  are  made  in
    the context of whether the adult dependent provisions of the Rules  are
    met.  The findings there made (leading to the conclusion that the Rules
    in that regard are not met at [24] of the Decision) do not seem to have
    found their way into what follows at [26] of the Decision.

18.  The Judge's finding  that  the  Appellants  could  continue  to  travel
    between Pakistan and their  children's  homes  as  they  do  now,  also
    ignores the medical evidence that the Second Appellant's  condition  is
    deteriorating.  As Mr Lay submitted, it also ignores  the  evidence  of
    the care which the Second Appellant will need and how that care can  be
    provided in Pakistan and in the UK.

19.  For those reasons, the failure  to  consider  Mr  Horrocks'  report  is
    material.  What is said in that report could  impact  on  the  findings
    about what will occur on return to Pakistan and, in turn, on the  level
    of obstacles which the Appellants will face there.  In any event, there
    is an error in the Judge's findings about  very  significant  obstacles
    which ignore much of what is said about the medical conditions  of  the
    Appellants and their ability to cope in Pakistan.

20.  In relation to the proportionality assessment, Ms Cunha submitted  that
    the Judge was entitled to take into account that the Appellants do  not
    meet the Rules as adult dependents (although  Mr  Lay  pointed  out  in
    reply that the Appellants had never sought to say that they  did).   It
    is of course relevant that the Judge has made  an  error  of  law  when
    reaching his finding as  to  very  significant  obstacles  which  might
    impact also on this aspect of the proportionality assessment.

21.  Ms Cunha accepted that it was implicit in the Judge's finding  at  [28]
    of the Decision that he accepted that family life  exists  between  the
    Appellants and their grandchildren.   She also accepted therefore  that
    consideration of the impact  in  Article  8  terms  on  those  children
    (including consideration of their best interests) is also missing.  Her
    point was that this is not material  because  the  Appellants  are  not
    dependent on the minor children.

22.  I accept that the way in which the Judge has considered this issue  (in
    terms of dependency  of  the  Appellants  on  family  members)  is  not
    impacted by any failure to take into account the minor children's  best
    interests.  However, the Judge has left out of account  the  impact  on
    those children (as opposed to on  their  grandparents),  in  particular
    those children with whom the Appellants currently live.  The Judge  has
    failed to consider the impact on them of their grandparents leaving the
    UK.

23.  The  failure  is  particularly  stark  when  one  considers  the  final
    sentence of [29] of  the  Decision  where  the  Judge  finds  that  the
    relationship can continue as it does now by the  Appellants  continuing
    to travel between Pakistan and the UK.  I repeat the point  made  above
    that this ignores the evidence about the deterioration  in  the  Second
    Appellant's condition and whether therefore the Appellants would be  in
    a position to travel as they did before.   There  is  no  consideration
    whether the continuation of the relationship at distance  would  impact
    on the children's best interests.  There is no consideration either  of
    Mr Horrocks' report in this regard.

24.  I accept Mr Lay's submission that  the  issue  of  materiality  is  not
    whether the outcome would definitely be different but whether it  could
    be.  For the reasons I have given, I accept  that  the  errors  of  law
    identified (and accepted  as  failures  by  the  Respondent)  have  the
    potential to impact on the outcome.  I therefore accept that the errors
    are material.

25.  It follows from the foregoing that I am  satisfied  that  the  Decision
    should be set aside on the basis that it contains an error of law.  The
    failures to consider certain evidence and issues impacts on the Judge's
    findings both within the Rules (concerning paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  and
    outside the Rules).  For that reason, it  is  appropriate  to  set  the
    Decision aside as a whole with no findings preserved.  The appeal  will
    need to be re-heard on all issues.

NEXT STEPS

26.  Both parties were content that, if I found the errors to  be  material,
      I should direct  that  the  appeals  be  re-heard  in  this  Tribunal.
      Although there need to be entirely fresh findings of fact,  there  are
      no credibility issues as such, and the findings needed are largely  an
      assessment based on documentary and oral evidence.

27.  As to directions, although there has  been  no  application  to  adduce
      further evidence  by  the  Appellants,  I  am  satisfied  that  it  is
      appropriate to  make  a  direction  to  allow  for  further  evidence,
      particularly since the medical evidence may need to  be  updated.   Mr
      Lay asked  that  I  take  into  account  the  possible  difficulty  in
      obtaining medical evidence quickly at the present time and asked  that
      the Appellants be given until at  least  1  October  to  file  further
      evidence.

28.  In relation to a resumed hearing, the First Appellant and  one  of  his
      sons gave evidence previously.  Mr Lay was unsure whether  that  would
      be the position in a further hearing and whether the  First  Appellant
      would need to give evidence via an interpreter.   I  pointed  out  the
      difficulties in taking evidence via an interpreter remotely and  that,
      if the First Appellant  does  wish  to  give  evidence  and  needs  an
      interpreter there might need to be a face to face hearing.  Due to his
      age, consideration would need to be given to the desirability of  that
      course.

29.  I have given directions below to permit submissions as to the  identity
      of witnesses, whether an interpreter will be required and whether  the
      hearing should be remote or  face  to  face.   I  have  also  given  a
      direction to allow for further time to produce  updated  evidence  and
      for a hearing not to take place until  after  the  deadline  for  such
      evidence.

CONCLUSION

30.  For the above reasons, I am satisfied that the grounds disclose  errors
      of law in the Decision. I therefore set aside the  Decision.   I  give
      directions below for a resumed hearing in this Tribunal.



DECISION

I am satisfied that the Decision involves the making of a material error  on
a  point  of  law.  The  Decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  I   Ross
promulgated on 29 November 2019 is set  aside.   I  give  directions  for  a
resumed hearing below.



DIRECTIONS

      1. Within 14 days from the date when this decision is promulgated, the
         Appellants shall file with the Tribunal and serve on the Respondent
         written submissions identifying the witnesses who are to be  called
         to give evidence, indicating whether any of those witnesses require
         an interpreter and setting out the Appellants' position as  to  the
         way in which that hearing should be conducted (via remote means  or
         face-to-face).   The Appellants shall also include joining  details
         for Skype for Business and a contact telephone number for those who
         it is intended should attend the  resumed  hearing  to  permit  the
         resumed hearing to be listed remotely should that be the Tribunal's
         decision.

      2. Within 14 days from the service of the submissions  in  (1)  above,
         the Respondent  is  to  provide  written  submissions  in  response
         indicating whether she wishes to cross-examine  any  other  of  the
         witnesses and whether she agrees to the forum suggested for the re-
         hearing.  She should also provide joining  details  for  Skype  for
         Business and a contact telephone number for those persons who it is
         intended will attend the resumed hearing.

      3. The Tribunal will then give notice  as  to  the  form  of  the  re-
         hearing.  The re-hearing will not be listed until after 30  October
         2020.

      4. Within two months from the date when this  decision  is  sent,  the
         Appellants  are  to  file  with  the  Tribunal  and  serve  on  the
         Respondent any further evidence on which they wish to rely.

      5. Documents or submissions filed in response to these directions  may
         be sent  by,  or  attached  to,  an  email  to  [email]  using  the
         Tribunal's reference number (found at the top of these  directions)
         as the subject line.  Attachments must  not  exceed  15  MB.   This
         address is not generally available  for  the  filing  of  documents
         which should continue to be sent by post.

      6. Service on the Secretary of State may be  to  [email]  and  on  the
         Appellants, in the absence of any contrary instruction, by  use  of
         any address apparent from the service of these directions.

      7. The parties have liberty to  apply  to  the  Tribunal  for  further
         directions or variation of the above directions, giving reasons  if
         they face significant difficulties in complying.
