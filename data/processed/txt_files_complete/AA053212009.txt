                         (ANONYMITY DIRECTION Made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Presenting Officer


                       CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL

 1.  By  letter  dated  7  January  2015  the  appellant's  representatives
    indicated that the appellant had decided to withdraw his appeal in  the
    Upper Tribunal as the  Respondent  had  confirmed  that  the  (pending)
    application for leave to remain will be considered in due course.

 2. Mr Mills confirmed that the appellant has an application made  in  time
    pending before the  Secretary  of  State  which  will  require  her  to
    consider all grounds including the Human Right Convention Article 8  if
    this has been raised.  As the appeal before me was  an  upgrade  appeal
    pursuant to s.83, this aspect would not be within my  jurisdiction  had
    the matter proceeded.

 3. Accordingly I am  satisfied  that  there  are  sound  reasons  for  the
    appellant having decided to withdraw  and  I  give  my  consent.  These
    proceedings have been withdrawn with the consequence that there  is  no
    longer any outstanding challenge to the decision of the AIT.




Signed        Date 29 January 2015
