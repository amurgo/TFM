                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

JUDGE  RIMINGTON:   The  applicant  challenges  the  Secretary  of   State's
decision of 18 August 2016 (the 'Decision') to refuse  his  application  for
indefinite leave to remain in the United  Kingdom  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
Migrant.  It is also a challenge to the Secretary of
 State's Administrative Review  decision  of  26  September  2016  (the  'AR
Decision')  to   refuse   the   applicant's   subsequent   application   for
administrative review.

The Factual Background

 1. The applicant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 5 May 1975 and  entered
    the United Kingdom on 23 September  2007  with  entry  clearance  as  a
    student valid from 10 September 2007.  He made further applications for
    Leave to Remain under  the  Points  Based  System  and  his  leave  was
    extended as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  by  various  extensions  to  20
    August 2016.

 2. On 18 August 2016 he made an application for indefinite leave to remain
    as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and that  application  was  refused  (the
    Decision) on the  same  day  under  paragraph  245CD(b)  and  (g)  with
    reference to  the  requirements  contained  in  Appendix  A,  paragraph
    19(i)(i) and 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The Decision recorded that when the  applicant  applied  for  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on 23 December 2010 he stated that
    he earned �43,926 from self-employment in his business entitled "Abbasi
    Accountancy and Financial Services" between  1  November  2009  and  31
    October 2010.  In addition, when he applied for leave to remain  on  24
    July 2013, he stated  that  his  income  from  Abbasi  Accountancy  and
    Financial Services Limited for the period between 1 July  2012  and  30
    June 2013 had been �53,504.44

 4. HMRC records, however, and on which  the  respondent  relied,  dated  5
    January 2015 indicated that the applicant had not paid tax as  required
    on these earnings.

 5. The Secretary of State concluded that it  was  not  desirable  for  the
    applicant to be  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  owing  to  his
    character and conduct under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules.
    Inter alia, the Secretary  of  State  noted  there  was  a  discrepancy
    between the earnings that he claimed in his  earlier  applications  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and the earnings that  he
    had declared to HMRC.  Hence the Secretary of State was  not  satisfied
    that his currently claimed earnings were genuine under paragraph  19(i)
    of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.

 6. Simply put, the applicant's case is that as soon as he discovered  that
    his previous accountants had made a mistake about his  tax  liabilities
    for his self-employed income, he took steps to remedy the  default  and
    that he had explained this  to  the  respondent  when  he  applied  for
    indefinite leave to remain.

 7. After issuing the Pre-Action Protocol letter to which the Secretary  of
    State responded the applicant issued judicial review proceedings on  23
    December 2016.

Grounds of Judicial Review

 8. The applicant in summary submitted that:

      i) the Secretary of  State's  approach  to  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules and findings in relation to it  were  flawed  and
         inconsistent with her published guidance; the  level  of  offending
         behaviour that the respondent relied upon did not  come  under  the
         scope of the provision;  either HMRC was misled or UKVI was  misled
         - the Secretary of State had not stated which: the  respondent  had
         failed to set out reasons under Paragraph 322(5) in line  with  her
         guidance: there was no evidence of HMRC taking action  against  the
         applicant: the subjective approach to  fraud  was  required  to  be
         adopted by the respondent

     ii) there was no evidence that a Senior Caseworker had  considered  the
         applicant's matter in accordance with published policy;

    iii) the Secretary of State acted unfairly  in  failing  to  invite  the
         applicant to put forward reasons why his application should not  be
         refused prior to his refusing his application, and

     iv) the Secretary of State's findings as to the  applicant's  currently
         claimed earnings were flawed in relation to paragraph 245CD (g)

 9. Initially the application was refused on the papers but permission  was
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Finch  at  a  subsequent  oral  renewal
    hearing.

10. In granting permission, on all grounds, Judge  Finch  stated  that  she
    found paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules  could  apply  in  the
    circumstances, but that it was arguable that the respondent  failed  to
    find whether the basis of the alleged dishonesty  was  the  failure  to
    declare income to the HMRC or the  inflation  of  his  income  for  the
    purposes of the application of leave.  It appeared that the  respondent
    had accepted the evidence submitted in 2010 and 2013 in relation to his
    genuine self-employed  earnings.    She  found  that  it  was  arguably
    insufficient for the respondent to merely  rely  on  factor  19(j)(iv).
    This interpretation of the Rules was fortified by paragraph 84  of  the
    Tier 1 of the points-based system - policy - which is entitled 'genuine
    earning test' which repeated the factors listed in paragraph  19(j)  of
    Appendix A and prefaced with a statement to the effect that  is:  "When
    considering your earnings we will assess the following:'.

11. Further it was arguable that a Senior Caseworker should have considered
    the application as per the Guidance:-

              'The respondent's own guidance on General Grounds for Refusal
             Section 4 - version 26.0 to her case workers indicated that in
             cases where paragraph 322(5) may apply a caseworker must refer
             an application to a Senior Caseworker before refusing such  an
             application.  Counsel for the respondent  submitted  that  the
             respondent was not obliged to follow  the  guidance  in  every
             case.  However, a failure to follow published  policy  on  the
             part of the respondent is an accepted and  arguable  error  of
             law'."

The Decision letter of 18th August 2016

12. The decision letter of 18 August 2016 set out as follows:

         "In your initial applications dated 23 December 2010 for  leave  to
         remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant you claimed a total income  of
         �66,920.97 from salaried and self employed earnings.   You  claimed
         self employment net income of �43,926.0 from Abbasi  Accountancy  &
         Financial Services for the period of 01 November 2009 to 31 October
         2010.

         In your last application dated 24 July 2013  you  claimed  a  total
         income of �73,754.90 from both salaried and self employed earnings.
          You claimed self employed net income  of  �53,504.44  from  Abbasi
         Accountancy & Financial Services Ltd for the period of 01 July 2012
         to 30 June 2013.

         HMRC data dated 05 January 2015 confirms the following:




         |Home Office  |Net Profit   |HMRC Tax    |Net Profit  |Discrepancies|

|2013         |             |            |            |             |


         The above records show that you have not earned the amount that you
         claimed in your applications for which you were awarded 40 points.

         You have declared as part of your application that you have amended
         your tax returns in November 2015 for  the  tax  period  2009/2010,
         2011/12, 2013 and 2014.  You have provided SA302 for the above  tax
         period with a letter from HMRC dated 03  August  2016  which  shows
         that you have contacted the HM Revenue and Customs on 2 August 2016
         for SA302.  These SA302 shows that you made the amendments in order
         to get indefinite leave to remain.  The amounts that you claimed in
         your previous applications submitted on 23  December  2010  and  24
         July 2013 were respectively not credible.

         The Secretary  of  State  is  therefore  satisfied  that  you  have
         declared these earnings to HMRC retrospectively and did not declare
         the earnings as part of  your  tax  return  at  the  time  for  the
         appropriate tax period.

         It is acknowledged that Paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules
         is not a mandatory refusal, however the evidence submitted does not
         satisfactorily demonstrate that the failure to declare to  HMRC  at
         the time of the self-employed earnings declared  on  your  previous
         application for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant was a
         genuine error.  It is noted that there  would  have  been  a  clear
         benefit to yourself either by failing to declare your full earnings
         to HMRC with respect to reducing your tax liability or  by  falsely
         representing your earnings to UK Visas & Immigration to enable  you
         to meet the points required to obtain leave to remain in the United
         Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.

         The Secretary of State considers that it would be  undesirable  for
         you to remain in the United Kingdom based on the fact that you have
         been deceitful or dishonest in your dealings with HMRC and UK Visas
         & Immigration by failing  to  declare  your  claimed  self-employed
         earnings to HMRC at the time and by falsely representing your self-
         employed income to obtain leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom.
         Your application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant is  therefore  refused  under
         paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

         The Secretary of State is not satisfied that your declared earnings
         in your previous applications submitted on 07  March  2011  and  08
         March 2013 are respectively genuine.  Therefore,  your  application
         is refused under Paragraph 245CD(b)(g), with reference to  Appendix
         A paragraphs 19(j)(i)  and  paragraph  322(5)  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."

13. In the Administrative Review request  the  applicant  asserted  he  had
    engaged new accountants, (Tax Direct Limited) in June 2015  as  he  had
    been dissatisfied with the services provided by his former advisors who
    had also ceased trading.  His new advisors advised him that earlier tax
    returns submitted to the HMRC were inaccurate  and  would  need  to  be
    amended with further submissions and payments being made to HMRC.   His
    case was that  his  original  advisors  submitted  returns  which  were
    inaccurate and once this became clear he sought to  amend  the  returns
    and make the necessary payments to make up the shortfall.  He did  this
    unprompted and did so because his new accountants  had  identified  the
    defect.  Therefore he had not acted dishonestly.   The  applicant  made
    the necessary amended returns to HMRC in November 2015 in a  series  of
    payments totalling �18,000 made to HMRC between January and July  2016.
    These changes were made on a voluntary basis and HMRC did not take  any
    action against the applicant despite its range of powers.

14. The AR Decision stated:

         "You contend that you have  only  found  errors  in  your  previous
         earnings declared to HMRC when  you  have  appointed  your  current
         accountant.

         We do not agree that the Secretary of State has made  an  error  of
         law by not giving you an opportunity to address  your  reasons  for
         refusal.  This Admin Review application submitted on 31 August 2016
         is the process which allows you to challenge any errors of law  you
         believe that have been done in your case"

    The AR Decision acknowledged  the  "Tax  Direct  Limited"  accountant's
    letter of 31 August which confirmed that he had made efforts to rectify
    returns to the HMRC in what be believed  was  a  timely  manner.   This
    letter, however, was found to have been submitted after the decision to
    refuse had been made on his indefinite leave to remain application  and
    was fresh evidence and did not meet the requirements of Appendix AR  of
    the Immigration Rules in paragraph 2.4.

15. The AR Decision confirmed that every potential refusal under  paragraph
    322(5) must go to the Senior Caseworker for approval. The  AR  Decision
    specifically noted that showed that he had only declared �5,215 of  net
    profit for the year commencing from 1 November 2009  until  31  October
    2010 and he had declared 'nil' for the period commencing  from  1  July
    2012 until 30 June 2013.

16. It was noted that there was over �80,000 discrepancy between the income
    declared to HMRC and the income stated in his previous leave to  remain
    applications and it was unacceptable to claim such a substantial amount
    of earnings  in  order  to  obtain  points  for  leave  to  remain  yet
    nevertheless declare only minimum net profit to HMRC.  The AR  Decision
    confirmed  that  a  decision  in  the  applicant's  case  was  made  in
    accordance with policy guidance and the Immigration Rules that  applied
    at the date he submitted his indefinite leave to remain application.

17. In response to the paragraph 322(5) challenge the AR Decision stated:

         "We have also noted your letter from HMRC dated 3 August 2016 which
         demonstrates that you have contacted HMRC on 2 August  2016  for  a
         SA3012 form.  The fact that you have  declared  these  earnings  to
         HMRC [a] few months prior  to  applying  for  Indefinite  Leave  to
         Remain is not sufficient to satisfy the  Secretary  of  State  that
         your  earnings  are  from   genuine   employment.    It   is   your
         responsibility to comply with UK Tax laws and submit  the  relevant
         tax returns to HMRC within a reasonable timeframe."

18. In relation to the applicant's point on AA  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2010] EWCA  Civ  773,  the  AR  Decision
    responded, "we  believe  the  original  caseworker  applied  procedural
    fairness when assessing the circumstances and arrived  at  the  correct
    decision when concluding your case" and finally:

         "In light of the  above,  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  the
         Secretary of State does not  accept  your  previous  earnings  were
         genuine  due  to  your  dealings  with  HMRC  and/or  UK  Visas   &
         Immigration.  The Secretary of State is  not  satisfied  that  your
         declared earnings in your  previous  applications  submitted  on  7
         March 2011 and 8 March 2013 are respectively credible.   Therefore,
         your application  is  refused  under  Paragraph  245CD(b)(g),  with
         reference to Appendix A, paragraphs 19(j)(i) and  paragraph  322(5)
         of  the  Immigration  Rules.   We  have  maintained  the   original
         decision."

The Applicant's Case

19. In relation to ground (i) Mr Heywood submitted that the  Decisions  did
    not establish a basis for  refusing  the  application  under  paragraph
    322(5) and the decision maker was required to refer the decision  to  a
    Senior Caseworker to affirm the decision.

20. The table attempting to compare net profit  declared  to  SSHD  in  the
    earlier applications to profit declared in HMRC and  to  highlight  the
    discrepancies was not comparing a like with  like.   The  "net  profit"
    declared to the Home Office was not in fact profit declared.   Earnings
    were clearly not the same as profit nor did the taxpayer or company pay
    tax on every single  penny  of  its  earnings  or  profit.   Given  the
    complexity of tax calculations and allowances the  applicant  submitted
    amended returns and submitted an SA302.  The applicant notified HMRC in
    November  2015.   The  applicant  was  acting  on  advice  from  a  new
    accountant and having realised that  there  were  inaccuracies  in  the
    earlier returns to HMRC made these returns  of  his  own  volition  and
    without prompting.  There was no ongoing enquiry into his  tax  affairs
    and he could dishonestly have simply maintained the earlier figures but
    did not do so.  The decision-maker states that the SA302s  showed  "you
    made the amendments in order to get indefinite leave to remain".   That
    conclusion lacked evidential foundation and was irrational.

21. The applicant's claim that he acted on  advice  after  instructing  new
    advisors in  2015  was  not  rejected  by  the  decision-maker  or  the
    administrative review.

22. The Decision merely stated  "the  amounts  that  you  claimed  in  your
    previous application submitted on 23 December 2010  and  24  July  2013
    were respectively not credible".  That claim was  not  demonstrated  by
    the fact that  there  were  amendments  to  the  financial  information
    provided, based on further (later) advice from accountants.

23. While noting the potential benefits to the applicant  in  making  false
    declarations, that  the applicant did  so  for  that  purpose  was  not
    demonstrated on the evidence and was contrary  to  the  evidence.   The
    Secretary of State goes on to say:

         "It is acknowledged that paragraph 322(5)...  is  not  a  mandatory
         refusal, however the evidence  submitted  does  not  satisfactorily
         demonstrate that the failure to declare to HMRC at the time of  the
         self-employed earnings declared on your previous  application....as
         a Tier 1 (General) Migrant was a genuine error."

    That effectively indicated that the approach  taken  by  the  decision-
    maker was that the burden lay with the applicant  to  prove  that  this
    general ground of refusal could not be invoked.

24. The basis of the applicant's asserted  dishonesty  or  deceit  was  not
    adequately  explained  and  the  decision-maker's  approach   did   not
    demonstrate  justification  for  invoking  paragraph  322(5)  that  was
    claimed to exist as shown by the statement:

         "The Secretary of State considers that it would be undesirable  for
         you to remain in the United Kingdom based on the fact that you have
         been deceitful or dishonest in your dealings with HMRC and UK Visas
         & Immigration by failing  to  declare  your  claimed  self-employed
         earnings to HMRC at the time and by falsely representing your self-
         employed income to obtain leave to remain in the United Kingdom."

25. Intention to act dishonestly was required to  make  out  the  decision-
    maker's claim and that was  not  established  in  the  decision-maker's
    reasoning.

26. The  decision-maker  gave  no  consideration  to  whether  to  exercise
    discretion as to request further evidence or  information  as  provided
    for in 19(k) or to consider other relevant considerations  set  out  in
    19(j).

27. The defects in the approach taken by the original  decision-maker  were
    not rectified by the AR Decision.  The  evidence  did  not  demonstrate
    that the applicant had made false claims in his earlier application "in
    order to obtain points for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  yet
    nevertheless declare only minimum net profit earnings to HMRC".

28. The decision-maker  was  wrong  to  approach  the  genuineness  of  the
    applicant's claimed earnings on the basis of the  terms  by  which  the
    review apparently discounted the relevance of AA (Nigeria) and  implied
    no  requirement  to  show  intent  in  a  requirement  to   demonstrate
    dishonesty or deceit.  As such the reviewer erred.

29. The administrative review did not rectify the unfairness created by the
    fact that the applicant had no advance opportunity  to  deal  with  the
    decision-maker's confirmed pre-decision and the accountant's letter was
    ruled out as it was considered to be fresh evidence.

30. In respect of the referral to the Senior  Caseworker  it  was  formerly
    submitted in the written grounds that the statement from Obe  Opara  of
    17 August 2017, served with the Secretary of State's  detailed  grounds
    of defence, was cautiously worded  and  stopped  short  of  saying  the
    application was referred for decision or providing internal minutes  to
    show that refusal was, as required  in  the  policy  scrutinised  by  a
    Senior Caseworker.

31. At the hearing Mr Heywood, did not abandon his argument in relation  to
    the Senior Caseworker's scrutiny of the Decision but accepted that  the
    authority of R (on the application of Samant) v Secretary of State  for
    the  Home  Department  [2017]  UKAITUR  JR/6546/2016  made  significant
    inroads into this argument.

32. In his oral submissions Mr Heywood advanced  the  submission  that  the
    issue of dishonesty was intertwined with the unfairness of  failing  to
    give the applicant an opportunity for interview.   I  was  directed  to
    number of authorities from the UT to the effect that applicant had,  in
    those cases, been given an interview or an  opportunity  to  deal  with
    questionnaire.

33. Further, I was invited to consider the issue of the current evidence on
    earnings as a freestanding issue.

The Respondent's Case

34. It was submitted that similar cases had been considered  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal and  consistently  rejected.   The  judgments  were  given  in
    substantive judicial review claims and citable in these proceedings and
    the Tribunal was invited to follow the consistent line of  cases.   The
    authorities provide clear support following propositions.

35. The issue of whether the person's character or conduct is  questionable
    for the purposes of paragraph 322(5) was a matter for the Secretary  of
    State to consider and determine because she was the  primary  decision-
    maker with the relevant expertise and charged by Parliament for finding
    the facts and exercising judgment.  The Secretary of  State's  findings
    and conclusions may be challenged on conventional  public  law  grounds
    only.  This was not a merit-based appeal and the issue  for  court  was
    whether the decision taken by the Secretary of State  fell  within  the
    range of reasonable responses.  Secondly, the legality of the Secretary
    of State's decision to refuse the application  under  paragraph  322(5)
    should be assessed by reference to the material  that  was  before  the
    decision-maker.  Thirdly, there was no common  law  obligation  on  the
    Secretary of State to invite the applicant to put forward reasons as to
    why his application should not be refused under paragraph 322(5) of the
    Immigration Rules. Fourthly, the Secretary of  State  was  entitled  to
    refuse a person's application under paragraph 322(5) if she  rationally
    concluded that he had not been honest or transparent in relation to his
    income either with the Home Office or another government department.

36. Fifth, the Secretary of State  was  entitled  to  refuse  the  person's
    application under paragraph 322(5) on the basis of  matters  concerning
    his tax even if the HMRC had taken no action against the applicant and,
    sixth, it was not a defence for a person who  had  been  refused  under
    paragraph 322(5) on the basis of matters concerning his tax  return  to
    say that his agent was responsible for the discrepancies.  A person  is
    personally responsible for his tax affairs.

37. In relation to ground (i)  there was a gap overall of �92.225.44 in the
    earnings that the applicant claimed in his application to the Secretary
    of State and the earnings he declared to HMRC.  He did not  declare  on
    time.  The Secretary of State noted that there would have been a  clear
    benefit to the applicant in seeking to mislead HMRC.     There  was  no
    plausible justification before the Secretary of State as to the gap  of
    some �92,000 in the figures and it was for not the Secretary  of  State
    to search for the explanation.

38. Paragraph 322(5) of the Rules is a discretionary provision and this was
    acknowledged by the Secretary of State  but  there  was  no  reason  to
    exercise discretion in the applicant's favour.

39. The applicant's behaviour was such that it fell within paragraph 322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules and the Secretary of  State  was  entitled  to
    exercise her discretion.

40. Insofar as the  applicant  disagreed  with  the  Secretary  of  State's
    assessment of the facts in this case, the starting point  ought  to  be
    Giri v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ  784.
    Richards LJ rejected the notion that the question  of  deception  under
    paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules is jurisdictional in  nature
    and fell to be decided by the reviewing court itself.  The role of  the
    Upper Tribunal was supervisory.  There was no issue of precedent  fact.
    The ultimate question for the Tribunal is whether the view taken by the
    Secretary of State is one that  falls  within  the  range  of  rational
    reasonable responses open to her given that human rights issues are not
    in question.

41. In relation to the applications  for  administrative  review  paragraph
    AR2.4 of Appendix AR provides:

         "The Reviewer will not consider any evidence that  was  not  before
         the original decision maker except where:
         (a)      evidence that was not before the original decision maker
             is submitted to demonstrate that a case working error as
             defined in paragraph AR2.11 (a), (b) or (c) has been made; or
         (b)      the evidence is submitted to demonstrate that the refusal
             of an application under paragraph 322(2) of these Rules was a
             case working error and the applicant has not previously been
             served with a decision to:
             (i) refuse an application for entry clearance, leave to enter
                  or leave to remain;
             (ii)      revoke entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to
                  remain;
             (iii)     cancel leave to enter or leave to remain;
             (iv)      curtail leave to enter or leave to remain; or
             (v) remove a person from the UK, with the effect of
                  invalidating leave to enter or leave to remain, which
                  relied on the same findings of facts."

42. Accordingly the post decision evidence and explanation contained in the
    bundle were not relevant and the fact that the  applicant  amended  his
    tax returns in November 2015 did not assist as this  was  done  shortly
    before his application for indefinite leave to remain.

43. In any event the applicant was required to be honest and frank  in  his
    original tax returns.

44. The refusal of the applicant's application  under  paragraph  19(i)  of
    Appendix A to the Immigration Rules was freestanding.  Even if  he  was
    not dishonest it was  entirely  open  to  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    conclude that his currently claimed earnings  were  not  genuine.   The
    burden was on the applicant to satisfy the Secretary of State that  his
    earnings were genuine.  The decision of the Secretary of State was  not
    "so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral  standards
    that no sensible person had applied his mind  to  the  question  to  be
    decided could have arrived at it", Lord Diplock in CCSU v  Minister  of
    Civil Service [1985] AC 374.

45. Mr Malik submitted that the applicant's argument advanced  in  relation
    to reference to a Senior Casework was "simply hopeless".  As set out by
    Collins J in R (Samant) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2017] UKAIT UR JR/6546/2016 at paragraph 20:

         "It is standard procedure in Premium Services that a case  must  be
         referred to a Senior Caseworker if a  caseworker  is  proposing  to
         refuse an application.  Once the decision to refuse is approved  by
         the Senior Caseworker, the refusal letter must also be approved  by
         the Senior Caseworker before the  decision  can  be  finalised  and
         notice of decision served on the applicant."

46. There was no good reason to doubt that the necessary procedure was gone
    through and applied here.  In any event the witness  statement  of  Obe
    Opara stated that "with a high degree of certainly that  the  case  was
    referred to her prior to the service of the refusal letter".

47. In relation to ground (iii) there was plainly no duty on the  Secretary
    of State to invite  the  applicant  to  put  forward  reasons  why  his
    application  should  not  be  refused  prior  to  the  refusal  of  the
    application.

48. The Secretary of State directed herself as  to  the  law  properly  and
    asked herself the right question.  The Secretary of  State  had  before
    her the application made by the applicant and evidence of his  previous
    applications and evidence and the information from HMRC.  The Secretary
    of State had sufficient information before her and there was  no  basis
    for suggesting that where there was a discrepancy in the amount claimed
    in the applications for leave to remain  and  the  amount  declared  to
    HMRC, that the Secretary of State was  obliged  to  put  the  applicant
    concerned on notice to invite further evidence  or  submissions.   That
    would be inconsistent with the scheme of the Immigration Rules.

49. Further there was no  obligation  on  the  Secretary  of  State  either
    arising from a common law duty or act fairly to invite the applicant to
    submit further evidence and explanation, and he cited EK (Ivory  Coast)
    v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 1517.

50. The gist of the evidence and information  on  which  the  Secretary  of
    State took her decision  was  communicated  to  the  applicant  in  the
    decision and that was sufficient to discharge  the  obligation  to  act
    fairly.  That was sanctioned in R (Mehmood  and  Ali)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2015 EWCA Civ 744 by Beatson LJ.

51. It was well-settled that the reviewing court will  not  interfere  with
    the decision unless it discloses a material public error.

52. It was submitted that it could  not  sensibly  be  suggested  that  the
    applicant would not have noticed any anomaly when he  had  paid  no  or
    minimal tax for the relevant years.  The irony was that  the  applicant
    was running a business named Abbasi Accountancy and Financial  Services
    and claimed to have made his  earnings  by  providing  accountancy  and
    financial services.

53. The outcome of the application was inevitable. He was not  entitled  to
    relief.

Conclusions

54. For clarity I have set out the legislative framework

    Paragraphs 322(1A) and 322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  provide  as
follows:

         "322.    In addition to the grounds for  refusal  of  extension  of
              stay set out in Parts  2-8  of  these  Rules,  the  following
              provisions apply in relation to the refusal of an application
              for leave to remain, variation of leave to  enter  or  remain
              or, where appropriate, the curtailment of leave:

            Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to enter
              or remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused:

              (1A)     where false representations have been made or  false
                  documents or information have been submitted (whether  or
                  not material to the application, and whether  or  not  to
                  the applicant's knowledge), or material  facts  have  not
                  been disclosed, in relation  to  the  application  or  in
                  order to obtain documents from the Secretary of State  or
                  a third party required in support of the application.

              ...

              Grounds on which leave to remain and variation  of  leave  to
              enter or remain in the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be
              refused.

              ...

              (5)       The  undesirability  of   permitting   the   person
                  concerned to remain in the United Kingdom in the light of
                  his conduct (including  convictions  which  do  not  fall
                  within paragraph 322(1C), character  or  associations  or
                  the  fact  that  he  represents  a  threat  to   national
                  security.

         Paragraph 245CD(b) of the Immigration Rules states that:

              "The applicant must not  fall  foul  for  refusal  under  the
              general grounds for refusal...

        Paragraph 245CD(g) of the Immigration Rules states that:

        ...the applicant must have 80 points under paragraphs 7  to  34  of
              Appendix A

        Appendix A, Paragraph 19:

             (i) The Secretary of State must be satisfied that the earnings
                  are from genuine employment.  If the Secretary of State is
                  not satisfied, points  for  those  earnings  will  not  be
                  awarded.

             (j) In making the assessment in paragraph 19(i), the Secretary
                  of State will assess on the balance of  probabilities  and
                  may take into account the following factors:

                   i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;

                  ii) whether the money appears to have been earned through
                      genuine  employment,  rather  than  being   borrowed,
                      gifted,  or  otherwise  shown  in   the   applicant's
                      financial  transactions  or  records  without   being
                      earned;

                 iii) whether the business  from  which  the  earnings  are
                      claimed can be shown to exist  and  be  lawfully  and
                      genuinely trading;

                  iv)  verification  of  previous  earnings   claims   with
                      declarations made in  respect  of  the  applicant  to
                      other Government Departments, including  declarations
                      made in respect of earnings claimed by the  applicant
                      in previous applications;

                   v) the applicant's  previous  educational  and  business
                      experience (or  lack  thereof)  in  relation  to  the
                      claimed business activity;

                  vi) the  applicant's  immigration  history  and  previous
                      activity in the UK;

                 vii) where the nature of  the  applicant's  employment  or
                      business   requires    him    to    have    mandatory
                      accreditation,  registration  or  insurance,  whether
                      that accreditation,  registration  or  insurance  has
                      been obtained;

                viii) any payments made by the applicant to other  parties,
                      and

                  ix) any other relevant information.

              (k)      To support the assessment in  paragraph  19(i),  the
                  Secretary of State may:

                   i) request  additional  information  and  evidence,  and
                      refuse the application if the information or evidence
                      is not provided.  Any  requested  documents  must  be
                      received by the Secretary of  State  at  the  address
                      specified in the request within 28  working  days  of
                      the date the request is sent, and

                  ii) request  the  applicant  attends  an  interview,  and
                      refuse the application  if  the  applicant  fails  to
                      comply with any  such  request  without  providing  a
                      reasonable explanation."

Ground (i)

55. Giri R (on the Application of)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 784 is authority for  the  proposition  that
    the question for the court is whether the decision-maker  was  rational
    in her approach and the question for me is whether the decision can  be
    impugned on public law grounds. It is not a question of precedent fact.
     Mr Heywood argued that there should be a decision as to whether  there
    was deliberate dishonesty and the burden of proof should not be shifted
    to the applicant.  The question, however, is, and in  line  with  Giri,
    whether on the facts and evidence before the Secretary  of  State,  her
    conclusion was rational.

56. Paragraph 19 of Giri  states as follows:

         "19.     In my judgment, Mr Malik's reliance on the decision in  Ex
             p Khawaja [1984] AC74 was  misplaced.   The  passages  I  have
             quoted from Ex p Khawaja and Ex p Bugdaycay [1987] AC 514  are
             fatal to his case on this  issue.   The  decision  here  under
             challenge is a decision made in  the  exercise  of  the  power
             conferred on the Secretary of State by section 3 of  the  1971
             Act to grant leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  The Rules
             contain detailed provisions as to  how  the  power  is  to  be
             exercised (though there is a residual  power  to  grant  leave
             even where it falls to be refused under the Rules).  Paragraph
             322(1A) is one of those provisions.  Its application  involves
             findings of fact, but  that  is  true  of  a  multiplicity  of
             provisions in the Rules.  If the conditions in it are found to
             be satisfied, leave must be refused under the Rules, but that,
             too, is true of many other  provisions  under  the  Rules.   A
             finding that the  conditions  are  satisfied  has  potentially
             serious  consequences  (see,  in  particular,  the  effect  of
             paragraph 320(7B) as summarised above), but paragraph  322(1A)
             is again far from unique in that respect.  The  key  point  is
             that the statute confers the power on the Secretary of  State,
             or the immigration officers acting on her behalf, to make  the
             decision whether to grant or refuse leave to  remain.   It  is
             for the Secretary of State or her officials, in  the  exercise
             of that power and in reaching  their  decision,  to  determine
             which provisions of  the  Rules  apply  and  whether  relevant
             conditions  are  satisfied,  including  the  determination  of
             relevant questions of fact.  On the reasoning in Ex p  Khawaja
             and Ex p Bugdaycay, their findings on such matters are open to
             challenge in judicial review proceedings  only  on  Wednesbury
             principles; it is not a situation in which their powers depend
             on some precedent  fact  the  existence  of  which  falls  for
             determination by the court itself."

57. This proposition related to paragraph 322(1A) but  applies  with  equal
    cogency to paragraph 322(5) and paragraph 19(i) of Appendix  A  to  the
    Immigration Rules.

58. At this point I emphasise that the facts  were  not  in  dispute.   The
    evidence before the Secretary of State was, as can be seen from  above,
    that the applicant for a series of tax years submitted a  'nil'  return
    for self employment to HMRC, save in  one  year  when  he  submitted  a
    return of self-employed  profit  of  just  over  �5,000.  He  submitted
    discrepant figures to the UKVI.  Even if one argues the  definition  of
    'profit' or 'earnings' and the comparison of like with like, the result
    is that the applicant agreed that there was a discrepancy over a series
    of tax years to the effect that the applicant  declared  in  excess  of
    �80,000 (Mr Malik submitted it was nearer �92,000),when submitting  his
    applications to the UKVI in support of  his  applications  for  further
    leave to remain.  By contrast  in  three  of  the  same  tax  years  he
    submitted a nil tax return and for one tax  year  he  declared  �5,000.
    From the subsequent amended returns  submitted  in  December  2015  the
    applicant made  voluntary  adjustment  to  his  declared  self-employed
    income and paid outstanding  tax  liabilities  to  HMRC  in  excess  of
    �18,000.   I set out this information as  it  was  in  the  bundle  and
    before the Secretary of State.

Declarations for 23 December 2010 application

59. For the two tax years 2009-2011 he claimed self-employment  net  income
    of �43,926 to UKVI but to HMRC he declared only �5,205.  These  figures
    were used for his 23 December 2010 application.

    Subsequent tax payments

       . For 2009/2010 (tax due 31 January 2011) his self-employed  earnings
         had been originally declared at �nil to HMRC  whilst  in  fact  the
         further tax liability payment made in January  2016  was  made  for
         �6,050.12.

       . For 2010/2011 (tax due 31 January 2012) his self-employed  earnings
         had been originally declared at �5,205 to HMRC whilst a further tax
         liability payment in January 2016 was made for �6,949.80.

Declarations for 24 July 2013 application.

60. For the two tax years 2012-2014, he claimed self-employment net  income
    of �53,504.44 to UKVI but to HMRC he declared �nil.  These figures were
    used for his 24 July 2013 application.

    Subsequent tax payments

       . For 2012/2013 (tax due 31 January 2014) his self-employed  earnings
         had been originally declared at �nil to HMRC whilst a  further  tax
         liability payment made in January 2016 was made for �2,427.25.

       . For 2013/2014 (tax due 31 January 2015) his self-employed  earnings
         had been declared at �nil. I see no adjustment for this year.

61. The application for Indefinite Leave to Remain before the Secretary  of
    State  identified  that  the  applicant  had  an  MBA  in  Finance  and
    Accounting and that  his  firm  was  entitled  Abbasi  Accountancy  and
    Financial Services; specifically this name was used  for  his  earnings
    straddling the tax years 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014.
     His field of study  in  section  L  of  the  application  form  showed
    'accounting and finance'.

62. Mr Heywood relied on R (on the application of Samant)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home  Department  [2017]  UKAITUR  JR/6546/2016  for  the
    proposition that there should be justifiable or  reliable  evidence  on
    which the Secretary of State founded her  conclusions  under  Paragraph
    322(5).  He argued that an  adequate  exploration  of  the  issues  was
    required and that there may be a suspicion that the applicant had  made
    such declarations to  benefit  his  position  vis  a  vis  the  various
    government  departments  but  this  did  not  warrant  a   finding   of
    dishonesty.

63. It is clear however, that the applicant did not dispute that there  was
    a significant discrepancy in the previous tax years  and  that  he  had
    voluntarily paid HMRC the deficit in tax due from January 2016 onwards.
    Nor could he dispute the time taken to rectify his tax  returns.  There
    was, as evidenced by the Decisions,  considerable  exploration  of  the
    evidence.

64. As the  Secretary  of  State  set  out  in  her  Administrative  Review
    decision:

         "In your initial Tier 1 applications dated 23rd December  2010  for
         leave to remain as a Tier 1 General Migrant  you  claimed  a  total
         income of �66,920.97 from  salaried  and  self  employed  earnings.
         Furthermore in our  last  application  dated  24th  July  2013  you
         claimed a total income of �73,75.90 from  both  salaried  and  self
         employed earnings.

         HMRC data for the above  name  period  shows  that  you  have  only
         declared �5,2015.00 of Net profit  for  year  commencing  from  1st
         November 2009 until 31st October 2010 and you  have  declare  'nil'
         for the period commencing from 1st July 2012 until 30th June 2013.

         It is also noted that there is over �80,000 discrepancy between the
         income declared to HMRC and the  income  stated  in  your  previous
         Leave to Remain applications.  It is unacceptable to claim  such  a
         substantive amount of earnings in order  to  obtain  points  for  a
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom yet nevertheless declare only
         minimum net profit earnings to HMRC."

65. The  decision-maker  rightly  in  the  AR  Decision  pointed  out  that
    paragraph 322(5) could apply to a migrants'  conduct  'in  the  'manner
    they are complying with UK Tax Laws and on migrants conduct in  regards
    to their dealings with government departments'.

66. Crucially as the Secretary of State set out in her letter  she  clearly
    took the time point against the  applicant  not  least  the  convenient
    timing of the delayed and voluntary declaration:

         "The fact that you have declared these claimed earnings to HMRC [a]
         few months prior to applying for Indefinite Leave to Remain is  not
         sufficient to satisfy the Secretary of State that your earnings are
         from genuine employment.  It is your responsibility to comply  with
         UK Tax Laws and submit the relevant tax returns within a reasonable
         time frame."

67. It is quite evident that the Secretary of State concluded that a  delay
    of nearly five years  in  declaring  tax  affairs  from  2010  and  the
    substantial amounts involved was not evidence of  compliance  with  the
    tax laws. She was entitled to draw those conclusions.    In  this  case
    the Secretary of State was unarguably entitled to  deem  the  applicant
    with knowledge of his own tax affairs.

68. With regard to AA (Nigeria) this is not a precedent fact  case  and  on
    the facts before her the Secretary of State's deduction  of  dishonesty
    was not outwith the range of rational responses and she  has  with  the
    statements  made  in  the  decision  given  adequate  reasoning.    The
    Secretary  of  State  in  her  Administrative  review  noted  that  the
    applicant had made amendments  but  also  that  he  did  not  make  any
    amendments until November 2015 and months before his  indefinite  leave
    to remain application.

69. Mr Heywood argued at this point that 'one could infer  dishonesty'  but
    there were a range of other possible explanations.  That is  not  quite
    the test to be applied.  That the Secretary of State's response  was  a
    possible and reasonable response  means  the  relevant  test  has  been
    complied with because the response  would  therefore  fall  within  the
    range of reasonable responses.   The  conclusion  does  not  shift  the
    burden to the applicant, even if that were the  approach  to  be  taken
    which in my view it is not.  The Secretary of State must be  rationally
    able to conclude on the facts that dishonesty was deployed.  As set out
    in R (Parveen and Saleem)  [2017]  JR/9440/2016  at  [61],  it  is  the
    applicant's  responsibility  to  give  accurate   information   and   R
    (Varghese) JR/5167/2016 at [34] succinctly  made  the  point  that  the
    applicant has a duty to be truthful.

70. Mr Malik  argued  that  the  applicant  had  proffered  a  disingenuous
    explanation and I was taken through the statement in  relation  to  his
    previous tax advisers which was said to be vague and contradictory  and
    his explanation irreconcilable on the evidence put before the Tribunal.
     That analysis however rests on  evidence  which  was  not  before  the
    Secretary of State and it is not for me to consider the matter  on  the
    merits.

71. If the applicant had declared his self-employment of over  �80,000  (or
    as Mr Malik argued �92,225.44) to HMRC on time then he would  have  had
    to pay more tax.  If he had declared to the Secretary of State his self-
    employed earnings as declared to HMRC his applications would have  been
    refused.  In this context the Secretary of State's decision  to  refuse
    the applicant's application for indefinite leave to remain was  plainly
    lawful and rational. As it was self-employment, I do not consider there
    is much to be gained by arguing whether  it  was  profit  or  earnings.
    Indeed, as pointed out above, the applicant confirmed that  there  were
    outstanding tax liabilities to the HMRC which were not paid  and  which
    had been overdue for a number of years.  There was  nothing  irrational
    in the conclusion of dishonesty she drew from the facts before her. The
    applicant by the date his tax returns were due had studied  accountancy
    and offered business services in accountancy.

72. Subsequently the applicant maintained he had been involved in  a  range
    of business activities and when  his  company  Abbasi  Accountancy  and
    Financial Services was originally established it was envisaged that the
    company would provide accountancy services by contracting work  out  to
    qualified accountants so as to provide their services to clients of the
    company. The company's focus of  activity,  however,  had  switched  to
    providing training to businesses and IT and did not provide accountancy
    services. That is  a  subsequent  explanation,  and  rather  surprising
    explanation after the representations in  the  application  form,   and
    moreover that was not  the  evidence  before  the  Secretary  of  State
    however or on the applications.    The  evidence  or  explanations  put
    forward  by  an  applicant  with   his   subsequent   application   for
    administrative review or during  the  course  of  the  judicial  review
    proceedings are not relevant.

73. The explanation in such 'self-employed  income'  cases  such  that  the
    accountant can be  blamed  has  been  given  short  shrift  R  (on  the
    application of Samant) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2017]  UKAITUR  JR/6546/2016.  Essentially  the  applicant  must  take
    responsibility for his own tax affairs. Not only  would  the  applicant
    have supplied the figures to his accountant, he would have checked them
    and would individually have received a tax bill.

74. The applicant was responsible for his own tax affairs and, having  been
    self-employed, would have been  sent  a  tax  bill  for  which  he  was
    personally liable.

75. That HMRC has not yet seen fit to issue a  penalty  notice  is  neither
    here nor there.  No doubt HMRC has  leeway  within  which  to  issue  a
    penalty notice or  institute  proceedings  and  time  would  only  have
    started running when the declaration was made in late 2015 (I note  the
    letters to HMRC were undated).   In any event what  the  HMRC  does  or
    does not do is not necessarily relevant to actions by the Secretary  of
    State in deciding applications for indefinite leave to remain.

76. In my view, on the facts, there was a solid  foundation  on  which  the
    Secretary of State could make a rational  decision.  On  the  facts  as
    presented the Secretary of State's response was unarguably  within  the
    range of reasonable responses.  She asked herself the correct  question
    on the relevant facts. The applicant knew he was self-employed and  had
    for at least three tax years made a nil declaration  for  self-employed
    earnings which supported an application to UKBI; it was  not  the  case
    that earnings  were  just  a  discrepancy.     It  is  unarguable  that
    dishonesty could be inferred.

77. I enlist my reasoning found in relation to ground (iii).   Deficiencies
    in tax returns and failure to pay tax can infer dishonesty  and  it  is
    open to the Secretary of State to apply paragraph 322(5) to such cases.
     Nothing in the Guidance precludes the Secretary of State from applying
    paragraph 322(5) in a points-based system case such  as  this  and  the
    guidance states:

         "A person does not need  to  have  been  convicted  of  a  criminal
         offence for this provision to  apply.   When  deciding  whether  to
         refuse under this category, the key thing to consider is  if  there
         is reliable evidence to support  its  decision  that  the  person's
         behaviour calls into question their character and/or conduct and/or
         their associations to the extent that it is  undesirable  to  allow
         them to enter or remain in the UK.  This may include cases where  a
         migrant has entered, attempted  to  enter  or  facilitated  a  sham
         marriage to evade immigration control."

      "If you are not sure the evidence to support your decision is reliable
      then speak to your manager or the Senior Caseworker".

Ground (ii) Reference to Senior Caseworker

78. (ii) In respect of this ground, I conclude Samant is a complete  answer
    because it is accepted  that  Administrative  Reviews  are  decided  by
    Senior Caseworkers.   There  is  no  indication  that  the  substantive
    decision was not referred to a Senior Caseworker in accordance with the
    guidance.  There was indeed a  witness  statement  from  Obe  Opara,  a
    Senior Caseworker confirming that to a high degree of certainty  he/she
    had checked the application. This ground has no merit.

Ground (iii) Failure to invite further representations/offer interview

79. (iii) Mr Heywood asserted that in  making  a  consideration  under  the
    discretionary provision of paragraph  322(5)  the  Secretary  of  State
    should have interviewed the applicant. He  referred  to  the  cases  of
    Samant, Varghese, Parveen, R (Kamal) v  SSHD  [2017]  JR/11417/2016,  R
    (Kawos) [2017] JR/4700/2016 and R (Majumder) v SSHD [2017] JR 4700/2016
    and identified that in all of those cases the applicant was  given  the
    opportunity  to  be  interviewed  or  at   least   presented   with   a
    questionnaire.  I was asked to consider EK (Ivory Coast) v SSHD  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 1517 and to note that in  cases  of  such  importance  as  the
    honesty of the applicant that a balance should  be  drawn  between  the
    need to operate the PBS and the fairness afforded to the applicant.

80. There was no duty to give the applicant the opportunity to put  forward
    reasons why his application should not be refused.  As  established  in
    the  Secretary  of  State  for  Education  and  Science  v   Thamesside
    Metropolitan Borough Council [1977] AC 1014 "the question for the court
    is did the Secretary of State ask himself the right question  and  take
    reasonable steps to acquaint himself of  the  relevant  information  to
    enable him to answer it correctly?".

81. I do not accept that it was incumbent on  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    afford  the  applicant  an  interview.  He  was  aware  prior  to   the
    application of 18  August  2016  of  his  position  regarding  his  tax
    affairs.  It was as he  states,  his  own  voluntary  disclosure  which
    raised the issue. Any explanation could be made with his application as
    he was aware of the facts before that application was made.  Indeed  he
    also had the opportunity to explain the claimed reason for his  belated
    tax declarations in his Administrative Review, which he did.  That  the
    Secretary of State did not accept the further evidence, the letter from
    the tax accountants, did not indicate  that  the  explanation  was  not
    noted. Indeed although there is a letter from Forefront Associates Ltd,
    in relation to the tax year 2012/2013  there  was  no  such  letter  in
    relation to the previous tax years.

82. In making the assessment on the  application  the  Secretary  of  State
    under Appendix A 19(i) and (j) the Rules refer  to  19(k)  which  state
    that the Secretary of State 'may'  under  19(k)(i)  request  additional
    information and  evidence  and  secondly  (ii)  request  the  applicant
    attends an interview.  The operative word is 'may' and clearly this  is
    a power not a duty.  It is discretionary whether or not  the  Secretary
    of State wishes to exercise that function. There is  no  obligation  on
    the Secretary of State to request further information or indeed  invite
    the applicant for an interview.   More than the 'gist' of the  evidence
    on which the refusal was made was communicated  to  the  applicant  and
    Beatson LJ approved that approach at paragraph [72] in R (Mehmood & Ali
    [2015] EWCA Civ 7.  Indeed in this instance it was  the  applicant  who
    had generated and submitted the documents which  led  to  the  refusal.
    The figures would not have been a surprise to him.

83. Therefore there is no argument to my mind that the Secretary  of  State
    failed to apply procedural fairness.  In EK (Ivory  Coast),  where  the
    applicant was not involved in the college's cancellation of the CAS, it
    was not considered unfair to proceed  to  a  decision  without  further
    notice to the applicant. In this case the applicant was in full control
    of his own affairs. Here, the applicant knew what was presented to  the
    Secretary of State and knew that the figures submitted to the HMRC  and
    to the UKVI were discrepant.  He signed his own application forms  and,
    as Mr Malik points out, would be responsible for his  own  tax  affairs
    when declaring and paying tax on self-employed income.   It  is  not  a
    question that he was employed and attempting to argue income  which  an
    employer had failed to declare. R (Majumder) does not in my view assist
    the applicant.  As pointed out in Majumder  the  applicant  could  make
    further submissions/give an explanation at  the  Administrative  Review
    which he did in this instance  and  which  was  identified  in  the  AR
    Decision albeit that further evidence was rejected.

Ground (iv) Asessment of current earnings

84. The Secretary of State's approach to  the  evidence  was  not  arguably
    flawed. In assessing the genuineness  of  the  current  income  it  was
    entirely open to her in accordance with both the Immigration Rules  and
    the Guidance to take into account all or  any  of  the  factors  listed
    under  Appendix  A  paragraph  19(i)  and  (j).    The   paragraph   is
    discretionary and a matter for the  Secretary  of  State  as  to  which
    factors  she  can  rely  on.  The  Decisions  are   comprehensive   and
    demonstrate  that all the relevant evidence that  was  before  her  was
    addressed and, when assessing the  current  evidence,  in  relation  to
    genuine earnings for  the  more  recent  years,  it  was  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to apply Appendix A paragraph 19(j)(iv), and to take
    into account verification of previous earnings with  declarations  made
    in respect of  the  applicant  to  other  government  departments.   Mr
    Heywood accepted that paragraph 322(5) could  apply  to  dishonest  tax
    returns.   Having made a rational  conclusion  under  paragraph  322(5)
    this ground falls away.

85. In conclusion, I am not persuaded that the Secretary of State failed to
    ask the right questions, or failed to take reasonable steps to acquaint
    herself with the relevant information further to Secretary of State for
    Education and Science v Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council [1977] AC
    1014.  The findings in relation to the  income  and  the  discrepancies
    submitted to the  various  government  departments  were  open  to  the
    Secretary of State and her approach to Paragraph 322(5) was  unarguably
    lawful.  This paragraph does not just relate to  criminal  conduct  but
    has wider ambit and the Secretary of State  rationally  concluded  that
    the applicant had not been honest.  As a  result  of  her  findings  in
    relation to the income it was open to the Secretary of  State  to  find
    that the earnings which were the basis of the  application  dated  2016
    were not genuine and to dismiss the application.
