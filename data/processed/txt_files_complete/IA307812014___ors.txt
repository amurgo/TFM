Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tarlow (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Hawkin, Counsel.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall,  in
       the  interests  of  convenience  and  consistency,   replicate   the
       nomenclature of the decision at first instance.

    2. The Appellants are husband, wife and sons. The first-named appellant
       entered the United Kingdom initially on June 20, 1999 as a  student.
       His leave was extended until December 21, 2003 and  on  January  13,
       2004 he submitted a fresh application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a
       student but this was refused on  May  19,  2004.  In  June  2005  Mr
       Nitemoor returned  to  the  Ukraine  and  married  the  second-named
       appellant. In September 2005 they returned  to  the  United  Kingdom
       using agents  and  false  passports.  The  third  and  fourth  named
       appellants were  born  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  2006  and  2009
       respectively.  In  2010  the  first-named  appellant  submitted   an
       application to stay under the ten year long residence rules for  the
       whole family. This was refused on January 14, 2011 and on August  4,
       2012 IS151A removal papers were  served.  No  right  of  appeal  was
       offered but following judicial review proceedings a  refusal  letter
       was issued on July 23, 2014 by the respondent.

    3. The appellants appealed those  decisions  on  July  31,  2014  under
       section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

    4. The appeals came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Caswell  on
       November 3, 2014 and in a decision promulgated on November  6,  2014
       she allowed the appeals under article 8 ECHR.

    5. The respondent  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  November  12,  2014
       submitting the FtTJ had erred by materially misdirecting her self on
       article 8 ECHR.

    6. On December 18, 2014 Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Levin  gave
       permission to appeal finding it arguable there had been an error  in
       law.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date  and  the  parties  were
       represented as set out above. The appellant and his "wife"  were  in
       attendance.

ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

    8. Mr Tarlow submitted quite simply  the  FtTJ  had  failed  to  attach
       sufficient weight to the appalling immigration history and the  fact
       the children had no entitlement to be educated here  in  the  United
       Kingdom. He argued the FtTJ  had  placed  too  much  weight  on  the
       children's best interests and not enough on the public interest.  He
       submitted there had been a failure to assess article 8 properly.

    9. Mr Hawkins adopted written submissions he handed into me and  stated
       the FtTJ had been fully aware of the issues raised but had concluded
       that removal was disproportionate. This was a finding  open  to  her
       and the FtTJ could not be faulted for her article 8 approach.

   10. Having heard  the  submissions  I  reviewed  the  determination  and
       submissions and refused the application.


ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

   11.  The  FtTJ  was  fully  aware  of  the  main  appellant's  atrocious
       immigration history and referred to this  in  her  determination  at
       paragraphs [1], [5], [7], [15], [20], [22], [32], [33] and [37]. She
       was mindful of the public interest  in  removal  and  balanced  this
       against the factors that had been advanced by  the  appellants.  She
       set out these factors in paragraphs  [6],  [8],  [10],  [19],  [23],
       [24], [25], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [34], [35], [36] and
       [37].

   12. This was not a decision where the FtTJ  disregarded  the  submission
       properly  made  by  the  respondent  but  she  found  after  a  full
       consideration of the evidence that article 8 was  engaged  and  gave
       reasons for her decision.

   13. I am not hearing this appeal de novo  but  considering  whether  the
       determination suggests an error in law. The FtTJ heard the  evidence
       and considered all of the statements and whilst  the  same  decision
       may not have been made by a different judge that is  not  the  test.
       The decision was not perverse because the FtTJ gave reasons why  she
       reached the conclusion she did.

   14. Accordingly, I find the FtTJ reached a decision that was open to her
       and the respondent's appeal is dismissed.

DECISION

   15. There was no material error. The original decision is upheld.

   16. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
       pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 I see no reason to alter that order.
