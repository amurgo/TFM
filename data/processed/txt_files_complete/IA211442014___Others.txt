Representation:
Appellant   Mr Doyle (Legal Representative)
Respondent  Mr Clarke (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. The first-named appellant came
    to the United Kingdom as a student on September 19, 2006 and has  lived
    here ever since. The second-named appellant came to the United  Kingdom
    in March 2007. The third and fourth appellants were both born here  but
    are also citizens of Pakistan. The  appellants  submitted  applications
    for further leave to remain  as  Tier  4  students  and  as  dependants
    respectively. The respondent refused these  applications  on  June  27,
    2012 and the appellants appealed those decisions under section 82(1) of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 2. The appeals came before Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Coutts  on
    August 28, 2012 and in a decision promulgated on September 3, 2012  the
    Tribunal remitted the whole decision back to the respondent because the
    Tribunal found  the  decision  was  unlawful.  That  decision  was  not
    appealed by the respondent and today it was accepted by Mr Clarke  that
    that Tier 4 application remains  outstanding  regardless  of  what  was
    contained in the recent Rule 24 letter and the recent determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Burns.

 3. Following the hearing on August 28, 2012 the appellant  indicated  they
    were advised by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Coutts to apply  again
    for leave to remain as Tier 4 student/dependants. They  submitted  this
    application on August 31, 2012 but before the  decision  was  taken  on
    that application the earlier decision was promulgated. On  October  26,
    2012 this second application was refused because the respondent  stated
    that the appellants had an outstanding appeal and by  implication  they
    still had leave under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

 4. Nothing happened until February 3, 2014 when the appellants  were  each
    served   with   Forms   IS151A   as   overstayers.   The    appellants'
    representatives sent a letter to the respondent on  February  14,  2014
    pointing out  that  decisions  were  outstanding  and  the  notice  was
    unlawful but this was disregarded in  the  sense  that  the  respondent
    issued each appellant with a removal decision on April 22, 2014.

 5. The appellants appealed those decisions and  the  matters  came  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Burns on February 26, 2015  and  in  a
    decision promulgated on March 9, 2015 he refused  their  appeals  under
    Article 8 ECHR and rejected Mr Doyle's argument that the  decision  was
    unlawful.

 6. The appellant applied for  permission  to  appeal  on  March  23,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred. Permission to appeal was granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Levin on the grounds it  was  arguable
    the Tribunal had erred.

 7. A Rule 24 response was filed by the respondent on June 4, 2015  but  as
    stated above Mr Clarke no longer relies on this document.

    ERROR OF LAW ISSUES

 8. The issue was quite simple namely that the decision to issue a  removal
    decision under section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999  was
    unlawful and consequently not in accordance with  the  law.   Mr  Doyle
    acknowledged that the appellants continued to have an outstanding  Tier
    4 decision and regardless of the merits of that application a  decision
    was still pending and the appellants continued to reside here  lawfully
    with 3C leave.

 9. Mr Clarke agreed that the decision taken on April 22, 2014 was unlawful
    and the appellants' appeals should  be  allowed  to  that  extent.  The
    result of such a finding would be to require the respondent to  make  a
    decision on the Tier 4 application and if appropriate to issue a notice
    of removal under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

10. Mr Doyle agreed with this course of action.

    DECISION

11. There was a material error.  The respondent's decisions  of  April  22,
    2014 were unlawful and the appeals are allowed to the extent  that  the
    respondent is required to make a lawful decision (and  to  address  the
    outstanding Tier 4 decision).
