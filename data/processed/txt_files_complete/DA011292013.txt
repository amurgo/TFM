Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms N Manyarara, of Counsel, instructed by Messrs
                    Freemans Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal (First-tier Tribunal Judge C M Phillips and  Mr
    M E Olszewski (lay member)) who in a  determination  promulgated  on  5
    November 2013 allowed the  appeal  of  Mr  Ajibola  Adeniyi  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State made on  29  May  2013  to  issue  a
    deportation order by virtue of Section 32(5)  of  the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007.

2.   Although the Secretary of State is the appellant  before  me,  I  will,
    for ease of reference, refer to her as the respondent as  she  was  the
    respondent before the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Similarly,  although  Mr
    Ajibola Adeniyi is the respondent before me, I will refer to him as the
    appellant as he was the appellant before the First-tier Tribunal.

3.   The appellant is a citizen of  Nigeria  born  on  3  October  1993  who
    entered Britain as a visitor in May or June 2005.  He  entered  Britain
    with his mother and brother.   In  December  2009  the  appellant,  his
    mother and his siblings were granted indefinite leave to remain as  the
    dependants of his father on the basis of his father's long residency in
    Britain.

4.   The appellant has a number of convictions starting  in  September  2008
    which include four convictions for theft and two for offensive weapons.
     One of the convictions had resulted  in  a  sentence  of  six  months'
    detention.  The UKBA decided against issuing a decision  to  deport  on
    that occasion and informed the appellant of  that  decision  in  August
    2011.

5.   In May 2011 he was convicted of having an offensive  weapon  in  public
    and using threatening, abusive  or  insulting  words  or  behaviour  or
    disorderly behaviour with  intent  to  cause  fear  or  provocation  or
    violence.   On  12  October  2012  he  was  convicted   of   having   a
    blade/article which was sharply pointed in  a  public  place.   He  was
    sentenced  to  fourteen  months'  detention  in   a   Young   Offenders
    Institution.  He did not appeal against conviction or sentence.  On  28
    November  2012  he  was  served  notice  of  liability   to   automatic
    deportation.

6.   The Tribunal, having noted the decision to deport, set out the  remarks
    of the sentencing judge.  The  comments  of  the  judge  contained  the
    following:-

         "Although you are only 18, you have got six  previous  convictions,
         two for robbery or attempted robbery and two  previous  convictions
         for possession of a bladed article.  That was on 13 May 2010 and 28
         April  2011.   On  the  first  occasion  you  were  given  a  youth
         rehabilitation order and on the second six  months'  detention  and
         training.  Possession of a knife like this is an extremely  serious
         matter.  So far as the nature of the knife  is  concerned,  a  lock
         knife  can  have  no  lawful  purpose  whatsoever.   You  say  your
         intention was to defend yourself.  In my view there  was  obviously
         an element of planning involved in this case by virtue of the  fact
         that it was tied to your boxers with a piece of string.   This  was
         not just a case of you picking it up on the way out  of  the  house
         and the likelihood is that you carry the knife around with you  all
         the time.

         As the Court of Appeal made clear in Pouthey, every weapon  carried
         on the streets, even if concealed from sight, represents  a  threat
         to public safety.  It takes just a  moment  of  irritation,  anger,
         drunkenness, some perceived slight, something totally trivial  such
         as a  look  for  a  weapon  to  be  produced  and  serious  injury,
         potentially fatal to follow and I am afraid that  an  offence  like
         this has to be treated extremely  severely.   Notwithstanding  what
         you  have  said  your  previous  convictions   are   an   obviously
         significant aggravating factor, even  though  they  were  committed
         when you were a juvenile.  One was relatively recent.  In  my  view
         the most important mitigating factor is your age, because  although
         you are nearly 19, that is still quite young and you have obviously
         not matured enough to appreciate this sort of behaviour is  totally
         unacceptable."

7.   The Tribunal heard evidence from the  appellant,  his  mother  and  his
    father.  The witnesses  stated that the appellant goes  to  church  and
    has changed since his release and would not cause any further  trouble.
    Moreover, he would have no-one to turn to in Nigeria.

8.   There was evidence from the  appellant's  Probation  Officer  that  the
    appellant complied with his licence  conditions  and  stated  that  his
    current risk of re-offending was medium.

9.   In paragraphs 50 onwards the Tribunal set out the burden of  proof  and
    a pr�cis of the guidance given in the European Court  of  Human  Rights
    decisions in �ner [2006] ECHR and Maslov [2009] INLR  47.   They  noted
    moreover the guidelines set out in the head note in Masih  [2012]  UKUT
    00046.

10.  In paragraph 46 of the determination they referred  to  the  new  Rules
    relating to Article 8 claims and in paragraph 61 onwards set out  their
    conclusions.  I note that in paragraph 70 they state:-

         "There is a minor child involved since the appellant lives with his
         7 year old sister.  This gives rise to the need to consider Section
         55 of the 2009 Borders Act.  The best interests of the child are  a
         paramount consideration and are generally  considered  to  be  best
         served by living with the parents in the country where they reside.
          The appellant's sister is  living  with  both  her  parents  in  a
         country where they reside.  Their appears to have  been  little  in
         the way of a relationship between  the  appellant  and  his  sister
         prior to the index offence because the appellant was  incommunicado
         at home and his parents would not permit his sister to go out  only
         in his company."

11.  Nevertheless the Tribunal concluded that the appellant's removal  would
    impact on his siblings as well as on his parents.

12.  The Tribunal then referred to the provisions of paragraph  398  of  the
    Rules, noting that it would only be in exceptional circumstances  where
    the respondent had held that the public  interest  in  deportation  was
    outweighed by other factors.  They concluded  that  there  was  however
    nothing exceptional in the appellant's circumstances. In  paragraph  80
    they said:-

         "In the light of the above we find that there  are  no  exceptional
         circumstances under the Immigration Rules  outweighing  the  public
         interest in deportation."

13.  In paragraphs 81 onwards they set out what appears  to  be  a  separate
    consideration of the rights of the appellant under Article 8 under  the
    ECHR.  They stated that  "The  test  of  insurmountable  obstacles  and
    exceptionality do not apply as they do under  the  Immigration  Rules".
    They then went on to say in  paragraph  82,   that  the  appellant  was
    living at home with his family and was plainly dependent on his  family
    for his accommodation and emotional support and that that was  a  "very
    strong private  life  factor".   Having  found  that  Article  8  would
    therefore be engaged, they  referred  to  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's minor sister, stating:

        "The  best  interests  of  his   minor   sister   are   a   primary
        consideration.  His offending behaviour and the stresses that  this
        has created for  his family  were not in the best interests of  his
        minor  sister.  His  rehabilitation  is.  These  are  a   paramount
        consideration but not the only one."

14.  They took into account that the appellant was noted as being of  medium
    risk of harm to  members  of  the  public  and  then  in  paragraph  87
    concluded that, having looked at all relevant factors, they found that:-



         "The respondent has not discharged the onus of proof and shown that
         the appellant's deportation is Article 8  proportionate.   We  find
         that the appellant has put forward  a  strong  enough  claim  under
         Article 8 for this to prevail against the public interest  in  this
         case in deportation. We find that the appellant having made out his
         claim under Article 8 of the ECHR does come within  the  exception.
         It follows from all the findings set out above  that  applying  all
         the relevant principles we allow the appeal on human rights grounds
         - Article 8."

15.  The Secretary of State appealed arguing that the Tribunal  appeared  to
    have placed weight on the fact that the appellant had  not  received  a
    warning letter in 2011.  That  was  irrelevant  and  indeed  there  was
    evidence that such a letter had  been  sent.  Moreover,  there  was  no
    evidence to support the tribunal's acceptance of the  appellant's claim
    that he had indeed taken courses in prison to address his behaviour and
    that he was motivated to change, particularly taking into account   the
    Tribunal's finding that the probation service  still  referred  to  the
    appellant as being a medium risk of harm.  There was  nothing,  it  was
    argued, on which the Tribunal could have based  their  conclusion  that
    the risk of harm would lower over time.  It was pointed  out  that  the
    Tribunal had found that the appellant had a supportive  background  but
    in the past that had not prevented him  committing  the  offences  with
    which he had been charged.

16.  It was pointed out that the appellant had  lived  in  Nigeria  for  the
    first eleven years of his life and there was no reason why as an  adult
    he could not readapt to life in Nigeria.

17.  Although the application was refused by Upper Tribunal Judge Renton  on
    29 November 2013, further grounds of appeal were then  submitted  which
    referred to the case of AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1634 and  DS  (India)
    [2009] EWCA Civ 544.

18.  Having considered those grounds, I granted permission to  appeal  on  2
    January 2014.

19.  Ms Holmes relied on the grounds of appeal.  She pointed  out  that  the
    Tribunal had been wrong  to  place  weight  on  the  assertion  of  the
    appellant that he had not received the warning letter where  there  was
    evidence that had been served by the  respondent  and  it  was  in  the
    appellant's interest to  state  that  he  had  not  received  it.   She
    emphasised that the Tribunal had ignored the importance of taking  into
    account the public interest in the deportation of those  who  committed
    crimes.

20.  In reply, Ms Manyarara relied on  her  detailed  skeleton  argument  in
    which she emphasised that the Upper Tribunal should not interfere  with
    findings of fact of a Tribunal  who  had  heard  the  witnesses  giving
    evidence.  She argued that the Tribunal had been perfectly entitled  to
    reach the findings it did in respect of Article 8 on  the  strength  of
    the appellant's private and family life and that they were  correct  to
    find that the interference with that right was disproportionate, having
    considered the public interest.  She argued that the conclusions of the
    panel were adequate and stated that  their  conclusions  were  open  to
    them.  With  regard  to  the  warning  letter,  she  stated  that  that
    conclusion was fully reasoned because they  found  that  the  witnesses
    were credible.  More importantly, she pointed out that the Tribunal had
    referred to the determination in Masih [2012] UKUT 00046 (IAC)  and  RU
    (Bangladesh) [2011] EWCA Civ 651 as well as the guidance given in  �ner
    [2006] EHHR 875 and Maslov [2009] INLR.  She asked me to find that they
    had properly applied those principles and had conducted the appropriate
    balancing exercise.

21.  They were entitled to find that the risk to the public  would  diminish
    over  time.  She   and  referred  to  the  documentary  evidence  which
    indicated that the appellant had undertaken various  courses  including
    that entitled "Survive Our Streets", had complied  with  his  licensing
    conditions and kept away from former friends after his release  in  May
    2013.  Moreover,  the Tribunal  had been  entitled  to  find  that  the
    Secretary of State had been unable to support the  assertion  that  the
    appellant had shown  disruptive  behaviour  in  the  younger  offenders
    institution.

22.  She referred to the refusal of the application by Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Renton who had stated that the Tribunal had been entitled to find  that
    the appellant was credible and moreover  that  he  had  a  very  strong
    private life here.  Moreover, she relied on the  determination  of  the
    Tribunal in Ogundimu (Article 8 - new Rules) Nigeria [2011] UKUT  00045
    (IAC) and stated that in any event in MF (Nigeria) the Court of  Appeal
    had endorsed a two stage test.  She emphasised that the  Tribunal  were
    entitled to find that the appellant did not have any ties in Nigeria.

23.  She stated that they were entitled to find, applying  the  criteria  in
    Maslov, that the removal of the appellant was disproportionate.

24.  In reply, Ms Holmes argued  that  the  Tribunal  had  placed  too  much
    weight on what she referred to as the trivial parts of the  appellant's
    evidence and that they had not properly considered the evidence of  the
    appellant's father which made it clear that he continued to  have  ties
    with Nigeria.

Discussion

25.  I consider there are clear errors of law in the  determination  of  the
    Tribunal.  It is clear that they place weight on the interests  of  the
    appellant's younger sister despite having found that he had had  little
    to do with her  before he was detained. What they  write  in  paragraph
    82, which I have quoted above is muddled: it is  not  clear  just  what
    they  considered  was  paramount:  if  it  is  the  interests  of   the
    appellant's younger sister that is clearly wrong particularly  when  it
    appears that the Tribunal had themselves  found  that  there  had  been
    little contact between the appellant and his sibling in  the  past  and
    there is simply no evidence to suggest  that  the  appellant's  sibling
    would be unduly harmed by his removal.

26.  Moreover, the Tribunal have clearly separated out  a  consideration  of
    the appellant's rights under Article 8 under the Rules and those  under
    the Convention.  That is wrong.  It is clear from the judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 that there  is  no
    difference in substance between the approach under the Rules  and  that
    under the Convention.  In paragraphs 44 onwards of that judgment it was
    stated:-

         "44. We would, therefore, hold that the new rules  are  a  complete
             code and that the exceptional circumstances to  be  considered
             in  the  balancing  exercise  involve  the  application  of  a
             proportionality   test   as   required   by   the   Strasbourg
             jurisprudence.  We accordingly respectfully do not agree  with
             the UT that the decision-maker is not 'mandated  or  directed'
             to take all the relevant Article 8 criteria into account (para
             38).


         45.  Even if we were wrong about that, it  would  be  necessary  to
             apply a proportionality test outside the new Rules as was done
             by the UT.  Either way, the result should  be  the  same.   In
             these circumstances, it is a sterile question whether this  is
             required by the new rules  or  it  is  a  requirement  of  the
             general law.  What matters  is  that  it  is  required  to  be
             carried out if paras 399 or 399A do not apply.


         46.  There has been debate as to whether there is a  one  stage  or
             two stage test.  If the claimant succeeds on an application of
             the new Rules at the first hurdle i.e. he shows that para  399
             or 399A applies, then it can be said that he has succeeded  on
             a one stage test.  But if he does  not,  it  is  necessary  to
             consider   whether   there   are   circumstances   which   are
             sufficiently  compelling  (and   therefore   exceptional)   to
             outweigh the public  interest  in  deportation.   That  is  an
             exercise which is separate from  a  consideration  of  whether
             para 399 or 399A applies.  It is the  second  part  of  a  two
             stage approach which,  for  the  reasons  we  have  given,  is
             required by the new Rules."

27.  Although the Tribunal referred to the judgment of the Court  of  Appeal
    in SS (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 550 they did not follow   the  guidance
    in that determination which is that in assessing the proportionality of
    removal, weight should be placed on the seriousness of the offence  and
    the interest of the public in the removal of an offender being the need
    to deter others from serious crime.

28.  I would add that  the  Tribunal  do  not  appear  to  have  taken  into
    consideration  the  fact  that  they  had  themselves  found  that  the
    appellant had been involved in gang culture in London for some time and
    had noted the Probation Officer's report which stated that  he  was  at
    medium risk of harm to the public.

29.  In no way do they particularise the  "encouraging  evidence"  that  the
    appellant had matured, changed his outlook and would not  again  become
    involved with gang culture.  It seems strange  that  they  would  place
    weight on the rehabilitative influences of the appellant's family given
    that the appellant had come from Nigeria to join them and that  he  was
    living with them at the time the offences were committed.   Indeed  the
    Tribunal do not appear to have placed any weight on the fact  that  the
    appellant has only lived in Britain for the last eight years.

30    Taking all these factors into account, I find  the  Tribunal  did  not
    properly  and thoroughly  as required  assess all relevant  factors  in
    their decision  and therefore that  there were material errors  of  law
    in the determination of the Tribunal.  I set aside their decision.  The
    appeal will now proceed for a hearing afresh.
