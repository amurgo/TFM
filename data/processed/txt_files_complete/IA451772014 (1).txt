For the Appellant:     Ms K Dasani, of Counsel instructed by Ashwood
Solicitors Ltd
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

 1.  Before  the  Upper  Tribunal;  the  Secretary  of  State  becomes  the
    appellant. However, for the sake of consistency and to avoid  confusion
    I shall continue to refer to the parties as they were before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

 2. On 5th May 2015 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer gave permission
    to the respondent to appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal J S Law who allowed the appeal against  the  decision  of
    the respondent to refuse leave to remain on the  basis  of  family  and
    private life applying the  provisions  of  Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE of the Immigration Rules.

 3. The grounds of application by the respondent  contend  that  the  judge
    failed to provide adequate reasons for concluding  that  the  appellant
    meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules and that  it  would  be
    disproportionate under Article 8 to remove her.

 4. In particular, the grounds submit that the appellant  and  her  partner
    were fully aware that when she entered the United Kingdom her stay  was
    precarious, there being inadequate evidence to support  the  conclusion
    that the appellant had the intention to return to Bangladesh  when  she
    arrived, especially since the judge had concluded that  she  could  not
    meet the requirements for entry clearance as the partner of her sponsor
    if she applied from Bangladesh.

 5. The grounds also contend that, despite the absence of medical evidence,
    the judge concluded that there  were  concerns  about  the  appellant's
    health yet did not reach conclusions about whether  or  not  she  could
    receive any medical treatment required in Bangladesh.

 6. As to the appellant's children, the judge's conclusion that  they  were
    too young to return to Bangladesh was not supported by reasons  for  it
    being unreasonable or unduly harsh for them to relocate to  Bangladesh.
    Although the judge found that the youngest child is undergoing  medical
    observation  there  was  no  evidence  to  substantiate  that  or   any
    consideration of the medical  treatment  which  could  be  obtained  in
    Bangladesh.  The judge had therefore failed to identify any exceptional
    circumstances which would make the  appellant's  removal  unjustifiably
    harsh on her, her children or her partner.

 7. The grounds also submit that the approach to Article 8  was  flawed  in
    failing to give consideration to the provisions of Section 117B of  the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as  amended).    In
    particular the Tribunal had no regard to whether or not  the  appellant
    speaks English or is financially independent.  The grounds  argue  that
    the appellant's circumstances merely amount to an ordinary family  life
    claim which has no exceptional features.

 8. Judge Colyer thought that all of the grounds were arguable.

 9. At the hearing before me Ms Dasani argued that the grounds were no more
    than a disagreement with the reasoned conclusion  of  the  judge.   She
    contended that the judge had not placed disproportionate weight on  the
    interests of the British children.  She also contended that  there  was
    some evidence to support the existence of  a  blood  disorder  for  the
    youngest child in the form of NHS letters to be found  in  the  bundle.
    Taking that into account and the fact that the oldest child  was  about
    to enter school she thought that there were compelling reasons for  the
    appellant not having to return to Bangladesh and reapply  to  join  her
    family in the United Kingdom.  Ms Dasani conceded,  however,  that  the
    judge had not made any reference to  Section  117B  of  the  2002  Act,
    although she emphasised that the judge had  clearly  applied  the  five
    stage tests recommended in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 and so was entitled to
    conclude that the respondent's decision was disproportionate.  She also
    claimed that the appellant spoke  English  and  was  supported  by  her
    "husband".

10. Mr McVeety confirmed that the respondent relied  on  the  grounds.   He
    contended that the points made by Ms Dasani were not incorporated  into
    the grounds.  Reference to the factors set  out  in  Section  117B  was
    essential even if the Section itself was not referred to  specifically.
    He also argued that the judge had failed to question  the  evidence  of
    the sponsor's income of between �5,000 and �6,000 per annum which would
    suggest  that  the  parties  could  not  be  financially   independent.
    Further, although the judge had found that the parties could  not  meet
    the requirements of  the  Rules  that  could  not,  in  itself,  be  an
    exceptional reason.

11. Both representatives suggested to me that, if an error on  a  point  of
    law was found, the matter should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal
    for a fresh hearing.

Conclusions

12. The decision of the First-tier Judge was not adequately reasoned in the
    material areas of the credibility of  the  appellant's  claim  to  have
    intended to return to Bangladesh after her visit with her oldest  child
    and, in relation to the health of the appellant's youngest child,  born
    in the United Kingdom.  Although the judge refers (paragraph 17) to the
    respondent's allegation of deception in  relation  to  the  appellant's
    intentions, he gives no reasons for the conclusion that the  claims  by
    the appellant and  sponsor,  that  it  was  always  intended  that  the
    appellant would return, were credible.  Cogent reasons were required in
    respect of that issue particularly when it is borne in  mind  that  the
    appellant and her oldest child purportedly intended a short  visit  but
    in circumstances where she could become re-associated with  her  former
    partner who is the father of that child.

13. The judge's conclusions about the medical  condition  of  the  youngest
    child is also flawed because, on the one hand,  the  judge  points  out
    that there were no Medical Reports relating to  the  condition  of  the
    youngest child yet, on  the  other,  believes  there  would  have  been
    medical concerns arising from the child's  birth.   Not  only  is  that
    conclusion speculative but is also wrong when the NHS correspondence is
    taken into consideration with its reference  to  a  blood  disorder  as
    opposed to a birth problem.  Additionally, even if the judge had  shown
    that he had taken into consideration  that  correspondence,  he  should
    have been alert to the fact that, in the letter of 23rd March 2015, the
    blood disorder was stated to be "not  in  anyway  detrimental"  to  the
    youngest child's health.  Thus, the judge's conclusion that the medical
    condition of the youngest child gives rise to exceptional circumstances
    shows a material error on a point of law.

14. Finally, the judge fails to make any reference, either directly  or  by
    implication, to the provisions of Section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  in
    relation to the public interest considerations applicable in all  cases
    if private and family life is raised.  There is no consideration by the
    judge of the test set out in Section 117B(6)(b) of whether  or  not  it
    would be reasonable to expect a child  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.
    Whilst the judge does  refer  to  the  respondent's  obligations  under
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and the
    five stage test set out in Razgar, this does not overcome the errors to
    which I have referred relating to the credibility of the  evidence  and
    the statutory test for the public interest which had to be applied.

15. As any re-making of the decision will require a re-examination  of  the
    evidence and fresh credibility findings it  is  appropriate  that  this
    appeal should be heard afresh by the First-tier Tribunal.  This accords
    with the principles  set  out  in  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Practice
    Statements for the Tribunal issued by the Senior President of Tribunals
    on 25th September 2012.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shows material errors on  points  of
law.  The decision is set aside and the appeal is  remitted  to  the  First-
tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.

Anonymity

Anonymity was not requested before the Upper Tribunal nor  was  a  direction
made in that respect by the First-tier Tribunal.

DIRECTIONS

 1. The appeal is to be heard afresh by the First-tier Tribunal sitting  at
    the Manchester Hearing Centre on a date to be specified by the Resident
    Judge.

 2. The appeal should not be heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J  S
    Law.

 3. A Bengali interpreter will be required for the hearing.

 4. The time estimate for the hearing is three hours.
