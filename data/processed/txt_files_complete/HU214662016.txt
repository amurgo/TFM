Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P. Lewis, Counsel instructed by Kidd Rapinet,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Lindsay, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a citizen of Kyrgzstan who was born on 17 November
         1984. He appeals against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
         Wyman promulgated on 23 August 2018 dismissing his  appeal  against
         the decision of the respondent made on 25 August 2016 refusing  him
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of a family  and
         private life that he has acquired with other members of his  family
         settled lawfully in the United Kingdom.

      2. The appellant first entered the United Kingdom on 8 June 2004  with
         entry clearance granted until 31 March 2006.  Entry  clearance  was
         granted to him as a student.  He  was  already  an  adult  when  he
         entered the United Kingdom. (He was then aged 19.) He  returned  to
         Kyrgzstan at the conclusion of his period of leave by which time he
         was 21 years old. Whilst this period of lawful leave as  a  student
         falls into consideration as part of  his  immigration  history,  it
         does not materially add to his present claim that he should not now
         be removed.

      3. The appellant returned to the United Kingdom some 12  months  later
         on 5 April 2007. He has remained here ever  since.   The  appellant
         was then aged 22. Once again, he entered the  United  Kingdom  with
         leave as a student which was,  in  due  course,  granted  until  30
         September 2009. He was then aged 24. His  studies  had  then  ended
         although he applied, unsuccessfully as a Tier 4 General Student  in
         September 2009 which was refused in November 2009. By then  he  was
         aged 25; his studies having effectively ended, there was no further
         basis upon which he might reasonably have  argued  that  he  had  a
         right to remain in the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the presence
         of his mother and younger brother. At the conclusion of his  leave,
         the appellant overstayed. Over a year later, in  2011,  he  applied
         for leave to remain on the basis that it would be  a  violation  of
         his human rights to remove him.

      4. Making all due allowance for  the  limitations  of  hindsight,  the
         appellant would have experienced almost insuperable difficulties in
         establishing, at the end of his student leave,  having  spent  2  �
         years lawfully in the United Kingdom and more than a  further  year
         unlawfully, that his removal was then unlawful.   The result  would
         have been the same whether or  not  his  mother  and  brother  were
         settled in the United Kingdom.

      5. His application to remain on human rights grounds was refused on 16
         February 2011.  That decision was not the subject of an appeal.  It
         supports what I set out in paragraph 4 that he had not  acquired  a
         protected private or family life.

      6. There  then  followed  a  period  of  5�  years  during  which  the
         appellant's  immigration  status  remained  unresolved.  Some  time
         later,  (and  I  was  not  told  the  date)  the  appellant  sought
         reconsideration of the  2011  decision.  This  was  refused  on  27
         October 2015. The appellant was  refused  an  in-country  right  of
         appeal although he was granted a right of appeal that he might only
         exercise after he had left the United Kingdom.

      7. By that time, the appellant had first entered  the  United  Kingdom
         some 11 years before and some 8 years after his last lawful  entry.
         However, his leave had expired on 30 September 2009, over six years
         before the October 2015 decision.

      8. That  decision  was  unlawful.  Judicial  review  proceedings  were
         settled on 24 May 2016 by consent upon the respondent  agreeing  to
         withdraw the October 2015 decision.  By a further decision made  on
         25  August  2016,  the  Secretary  of  State  again   refused   the
         appellant's application. The period between 27 October 2015 and  25
         August 2016, some 10 months, represents  a  delay  in  the  process
         which can authoritatively be attributed to the Secretary  of  State
         by his making an unlawful decision.

      9. The decision was made on the basis  that  the  appellant  would  be
         afforded a right of appeal. It is  this  appeal  that  came  before
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Wyman in August 2018. That  was  some  7�
         years after the appellant's  application  of  2011.  By  then,  the
         appellant was 31 years old. By the time the matter came  before  me
         he was 34 years  old.  However,  his  last  leave  had  expired  in
         September 2009, almost 9 � years ago.

     10. The respondent's decision was reached after a consideration of  the
         Immigration Rules. When the appellant entered the United Kingdom in
         April 2007 he had spent almost his entire  life  in  Kyrgzstan  and
         there were no very significant obstacles in  his  returning  there.
         The appellant speaks Russian, the country's official language.  The
         appellant, however, claimed that, although he was healthy,  he  had
         an emotional dependency upon his mother and brother both settled in
         the United Kingdom.  He was exceptionally close to  them  and  this
         rendered it disproportionate to remove him.

     11. The evidence before the Tribunal was that his mother's elder sister
         still lives in Kyrgzstan. (There are four other aunts and one uncle
         with whom the mother has  no  contact.)  His  mother  still  visits
         although she no longer owns property there.

     12. It thus becomes necessary to consider the  circumstances  in  which
         his mother and his younger brother acquired  settled  status  which
         has not been afforded to the appellant.

     13. The appellant's mother came to the United Kingdom in 2002 in  order
         to advance her studies. She came on a  teacher-exchange  programme.
         At that time the appellant was  aged  17  and  was  left  with  his
         maternal grandmother. The grandmother died in  2003.   By  December
         2003, the appellant's mother had  married  a  British  citizen,  Mr
         Davis. The couple had met in early 2003. By December 2003, however,
         the appellant was already an adult. According to  paragraph  48  of
         the Judge's determination, it was the couple's intention  to  bring
         both her children to the United Kingdom.  The  appellant's  younger
         brother was still a minor and he entered the United  Kingdom  as  a
         dependant of his mother in December 2004. The appellant's aunt  had
         looked after his younger brother (and, perhaps, to some extent  the
         appellant) in the interim.

     14. The appellant, unlike his brother, could not seek entry as a minor.
          Hence the decision to obtain entry as a student with limited leave
         to enter. He did so in June 2004, returning to Kyrgzstan at the end
         of his student leave in March 2006.

     15. The same thinking prompted a re-entry into the United Kingdom as  a
         student on 5 April 2007.

     16. Mr Davis and his mother are settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.  His
         younger brother, five years the appellant's junior,  was  28  years
         old at the hearing before the Judge. He works as a bus  driver  but
         hopes to qualify as an electrician. He married in 2015. At the time
         of the hearing, he was still living with his mother and step-father
         but was hoping to move out to his own home in  the  course  of  the
         year. Both he and his mother are British citizens. His  wife  works
         as a sales executive for Harrods.

     17. The appellant's mother had given evidence that her  first  marriage
         had been unhappy and  that  she  had  been  subjected  to  domestic
         violence. His father left the family in 1989 when he was just  five
         years old. This has resulted in the appellant having  lost  contact
         with his father and his paternal relatives. The appellant explained
         that this traumatic event  led  to  his  being  ostracised  by  the
         family.

     18. The appellant relied upon the circumstances of his separation  from
         his father when he was aged 5;  his  mother's  isolation  from  the
         father's family since then; the departure of his mother to  the  UK
         in 2002 and his remaining in Kyrgzstan with his younger brother and
         with his grandmother and then his aunt.

     19. Medical evidence was produced before the First-tier Tribunal. In  a
         letter  from  the  Whittington  Hospital  following   a   bout   of
         gastrointestinal and  abdominal  pain,  it  is  recorded  that  the
         appellant was drinking excessively and that he reported drinking  a
         bottle of vodka a day which had been increasing in the previous two
         months due to  an  event  which  the  appellant  was  reluctant  to
         explain. There were incidents on 22 February 2018 and 12 July  2018
         when the appellant was admitted to  Accident  and  Emergency  as  a
         result of excessive drinking.

     20.  Dr  Saleh  Dhumad,  a  consultant   psychiatrist   and   cognitive
         behavioural psychotherapist, provided a  report  dated  23  January
         2018. He has a special interest in PTSD and is  a  senior  lecturer
         and trainer in  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  in  Iraq  and  has
         trained and supervised doctors in the diagnosis  and  treatment  of
         PTSD. He is an international speaker on the subject of  trauma  and
         conflict.

     21. The appellant described to Dr Dhumad that he had been  detained  in
         immigration detention for some three weeks in November 2015  and  a
         further two days in March 2016. He stated that this had resulted in
         a material deterioration in his mental health as a result  of  what
         he considered to be the traumatic circumstances of  his  detention.
         Upon his release,  he  commenced  to  drink  excessive  amounts  of
         alcohol and attended a private clinic on two occasions  in  January
         2016 and August 2017 for treatment. He told the doctor that he  had
         not used alcohol since then, save in moderation.

     22. Dr Dhumad diagnosed the appellant as suffering the symptoms of post-
         traumatic stress disorder. At that  time,  the  appellant  told  Dr
         Dhumad that he had not informed his GP about his mental health  and
         was  not  then  on  medication.  Dr  Dhumad  considered  that   the
         appellant's presentation  was  consistent  with  the  diagnosis  of
         moderate Depressive Episode. There was a moderate risk  of  suicide
         which increased in the context of deportation and the main  factors
         in his condition were depression, PTSD and hopelessness. His family
         in the United Kingdom are his main protective factor. His sense  of
         hopelessness  impacts  upon  the  suicide   risk,   increasing   it
         significantly when he feels that deportation is close.

     23. The First-tier Tribunal Judge summarised the report of Dr Dhumad in
         paragraphs 53 to 56 of his determination. It is clear that  he  had
         the contents of the  report  well  in  mind  when  he  reached  his
         conclusion.

     24.  The  report  is  further  considered  in  paragraph  64   of   the
         determination and its wider implications in relation  to  what  was
         then current medication and further steps to seek treatment between
         paragraphs 71 and 73 as well as in paragraph 83. His depression has
         since been treated by his GP using antidepressants.

     25. The grounds of appeal argue that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in
         law. The first ground is that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  failed
         to have regard to the psychiatric evidence. As I have  pointed  out
         above, the Judge made copious references  to  the  evidence  of  Dr
         Dhumad. That was the evidence before him. The evidence as  a  whole
         was limited in the sense that there was little evidence from the GP
         who had only recently referred him for an initial assessment with a
         counsellor  in  May  2018.  He  was  waiting   to   start   further
         psychological  work.  His  only  medication  were   antidepressants
         prescribed as recently as March 2018. There was no evidence of  his
         admission to a private clinic in January 2016 and August 2017.  The
         Judge expressly found that this was 'surprising' in paragraph 64 of
         his determination. There was no evidence  that  the  appellant  had
         ever seen a counsellor. There was no evidence about  his  treatment
         for alcohol abuse. In his evidence,  the  appellant  said  that  Dr
         Patel had offered to refer him  to  alcohol  services  but  he  had
         failed to take any steps in this regard. In my judgement  this  was
         ample evidence for the judge to comment on the limitations  of  the
         medical evidence. I do not  construe  that  to  mean  that  he  was
         commenting upon any limitations in Dr Dhumad's report.

     26. The diagnosis that Dr Dhumad had made about the appellant suffering
         from depression  was  implicitly  accepted  by  the  judge  in  his
         references to  his  being  prescribed  medication  for  depression,
         albeit as recently as March 2018. The diagnosis that Dr Dhumad  had
         made in relation to PTSD is likely to refer to the  effect  of  his
         period in immigration detention (some 23 days in all). There is  no
         suggestion that this detention was unlawful, given the  appellant's
         immigration status, but that does  not  undermine  the  appellant's
         claim about its personal effect upon him.  Whilst the appellant may
         have been the victim of a broken marriage, his father left him when
         he was five years old, 29 years ago. There is  no  doubt  that  the
         uncertainty about the  appellant's  immigration  status  will  have
         contributed to his sense of hopelessness and  depression.  That  is
         wholly understandable. All of these  considerations  were  apparent
         from Dr Dhumad's report to which the Judge referred but  there  was
         no need for the Judge to go further.

     27. He has family support in the United  Kingdom.   He  will  have  the
         support, at least, of his aunt on return.  His mental health  must,
         and will be, monitored during his travel home.  There is no history
         of self-harm, save through alcohol abuse.  The  evidence  does  not
         establish the risk of suicide is such as to prevent removal.

     28.    I reject the first ground of appeal.

     29. The second ground speaks of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's failure
         to have regard to the delay. I have been at pains to point out  the
         chronology in the foregoing paragraphs  in  order  to  set  out  in
         detail the reasons why the  Tribunal  is  considering  in  2019  an
         application made in 2011. However,  the  chronology  which  I  have
         adopted has been entirely derived from the  date  set  out  in  the
         determination. All the material dates are  there.   The  Judge  was
         well aware of the delays implicit in his recital of the immigration
         history.

     30. Delay is a feature regardless of who is responsible for it  because
         it provides the appellant with the opportunity to develop  an  ever
         closer private and family life. The personal effect of  delay  upon
         an individual may be the same in the  case  of  a  person  who  has
         entered the United Kingdom illegally and remained incognito for the
         next 10 years as in the case of a person who entered  lawfully  and
         applied for further leave to remain and then had to wait  10  years
         for a decision. Nevertheless, the delay in  those  two  contrasting
         examples is likely to be treated differently by  the  Tribunal.  It
         thus becomes necessary, whilst  acknowledging  the  overall  period
         during  which  the  appellant's   immigration   status   has   been
         unresolved, to consider how that situation has arisen.

     31. Following the appellant's arrival in the United Kingdom on 5  April
         2007, his period of leave expired on 30  September  2009.  He  then
         overstayed. The application before me is  an  application  made  in
         2011 which was refused on 16 February 2011. The decision was  later
         reconsidered by the Secretary of State  and  refused  again  on  27
         October 2015. There is little evidence about whether the  delay  in
         making the decision on 27 October 2015 was entirely attributable to
         the respondent but, inferentially, at least some of it is likely to
         have been. I have already  pointed  out  that  the  10-month  delay
         between 27 October 2015 and August 2016  was  attributable  to  the
         fact that the appellant was not afforded  an  in-country  right  of
         appeal. Thereafter, time has elapsed in the course  of  the  appeal
         process. The First-tier Tribunal did not finally  hear  the  appeal
         until 1 August 2018,  the  determination  followed  swiftly  on  23
         August  2018;  leave  to  appeal  was  refused  in  the  First-tier
         Tribunal. It was granted by the Upper Tribunal on 27 December 2018.
         Directions were given on 3 January 2019 in the  hearing  before  me
         took place on 29 January 2019.

     32. In the course of this process, the appellant has never received  an
         indication that his application or his subsequent appeal was likely
         to succeed.  Since he first  overstayed  in  2009,  his  subsequent
         applications have never carried a right to be treated as  a  person
         with continuing leave.  His  immigration  status  has  always  been
         precarious.  As I pointed out, the human rights claim did not  have
         a realistic chance of success when it was  made  in  2011.  It  has
         inevitably improved with the sheer passage of time  but  the  delay
         cannot all be attributed to the fault of the  Secretary  of  State.
         Apart from the passage of time, the family situation  has  remained
         remarkably stable.  The mother and brother's claim have always been
         secure and neither is dependent on the appellant for  any  specific
         support.  Whilst the strength of the emotional bond that is said to
         exist has been consistently highlighted by the appellant, there  is
         little firm evidence that  its  character  is  different  from  the
         normal relationship  between  a  parent  and  a  child  or  between
         siblings save for the fact that they are in a position of  relative
         strength created by their own secure position in the UK whilst  the
         appellant is in a position of relative  need  created  by  his  own
         insecurity.  That, however, is the same is almost all cases where a
         settled  relative  provides  a  home  to  a  non-national  with   a
         precarious immigration status.

     33. For these reasons, I am not satisfied that  delay  arising  through
         the default of the respondent accounts for  a  significant  period,
         save for those periods which I have identified above. The fact that
         the appellant has been in the UK for a considerable period of  time
         must go into the balance (indeed it is his presence in  the  United
         Kingdom which is the principal factor in his favour given the  fact
         that he had no arguable claim to remain when his leave expired  and
         he remained as an overstayer).  But I am  not  prepared  to  equate
         presence with delay save as I  have  earlier  indicated.   Further,
         there is no doubt that the Secretary of State has  always  made  it
         clear what his intention has  consistently  been  since  the  first
         adverse decision was made in 2011 and has never given the appellant
         any indication that he has a right to stay.   That  does  not  mean
         that the appellant will not have hoped  he  might  remain,  however
         groundless that aspiration might have been.   That  is,  doubtless,
         what this  drawn-out  process  of  decision-making  and  litigation
         brings in its wake.  That, however has to be set against  the  fact
         that there is also public a interest gravitating against permitting
         to remain a person who, many years ago, entered the United  Kingdom
         as a student and who overstayed, notwithstanding  the  presence  of
         other family members, unless the situation is exceptional.

     34. I note that Mr Lewis in his undated skeleton  argument  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal does not refer to delay as a  separate  element
         of the claim, although mentioning  the  length  of  time  that  the
         appellant has spent in the United Kingdom. This may explain why the
         Judge did not deal with the issue under a separate heading.

     35. Although it was not  raised  before  me,  I  am  conscious  of  the
         striking disparity between the  appellant  and  his  brother,  five
         years his junior.  The brother is a British  citizen,  married,  in
         work with good prospects and about to start a home of his own.  The
         stark difference arises, of course, because the appellant's brother
         entered the United Kingdom as a minor and was  able  to  enjoy  the
         vicarious benefits derived from his mother's status as  the  spouse
         of a British citizen.  The appellant, as we have seen, has  at  all
         relevant times been  an  adult,  albeit  a  young  adult,  and  the
         Immigration Rules do not provide for similar treatment to those who
         are in a position to lead an independent life.  The fact  that  the
         mother has chosen to remain in the United Kingdom is  a  matter  of
         choice, made reasonably, but it was always a  decision  that  would
         have consequences.  Neither she nor  her  husband  could  determine
         where the appellant would settle; indeed, this  was  known  to  the
         couple and was reflected in the  decision  to  have  the  appellant
         enter the United Kingdom as a student.  He could not  have  entered
         as a family member and even a creative  application  of  Article  8
         would not have led to such a result.

     36. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  make  a
         material error of law.

DECISION

    The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no error on a point of law  and  the
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
