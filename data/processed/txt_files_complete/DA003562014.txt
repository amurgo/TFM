For the respondent: Mr Tom Wilding


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Gillian Jackson), sitting at Kingston on 15 July  2014,
    to  a deportation appeal by a citizen of Sri Lanka, born 8 August 1973,
    and married to a citizen of Germany, originally from the  same  island,
    and now 39.

 2. The Home Office applied for permission to appeal on grounds relating to
    the judge's findings on (1) the  consequences  of  the  decision  under
    appeal in terms of separation between the appellant and his  wife;  and
    (2) the nature of his ties with this country and with Sri  Lanka.  That
    was refused by a first-tier judge; but permission was  granted  by  the
    Upper  Tribunal  on  renewed   grounds,   relating   to   the   judge's
    proportionality conclusions at  paragraph  47,  on  the  basis  of  her
    assessment of the evidence, especially at paragraphs 40 and 44.

 3. We cannot improve on  the  judge's  summary  of  the  evidence,  up  to
    paragraph 43:  it  is  both  comprehensive  and  clear,  without  being
    unnecessarily long. The essential features of the case are that

      a) the appellant was here with leave as a student from 2004 - 05,  and
         then as a worker from 2005 till 15 January 2012.

      b) His wife left Sri Lanka with her family for Germany  in  1988,  and
         became a German citizen in 1993: in 2008 a  marriage  was  arranged
         between them, following which she moved to this country, where  she
         has stayed ever since with him, exercising her Treaty rights  as  a
         worker. They have no children so far.

      c) On 18  June  2012  the  appellant  was  sentenced  to  five  years'
         imprisonment  for  his   involvement   in   money-laundering.   The
         sentencing  judge  found  he  had  been  directly  involved  in   a
         fraudulent transfer of  E415,000  on  5  May  2010,  but  that  his
         involvement had clearly been something "substantially greater" than
         that one transaction, since the jury had  found  him  guilty  on  a
         count involving a course of business taking place  between  October
         2009 and then.

      d) The  judge  found  that  the  money  represented  the  proceeds  of
         trafficking in cannabis. The appellant had had a far  more  limited
         r�le in what had been going on, but not just  as  a  courier,  than
         that of his co-accused, each sentenced to ten years'  imprisonment,
         though they too had no previous convictions,  for  laundering  sums
         amounting to �40m in all.

      e) That conviction led to the  appellant's  being  refused  a  husband
         residence card on 13 May 2013, and to a  decision  to  deport  him,
         served on 17 February 2014, now under appeal.

      f) The appellant maintained his  innocence  throughout,  to  probation
         officers and the judge, till a statement  of  9  January  2015,  to
         which we shall turn later.

      g) The appellant's Offender Assessment System [OASys] assessment of 12
         November 2012 rated his likelihood of reconviction as 'low', with a
         probability of 10% within one year  and  19%  in  two.  However,  a
         further National Offender Management Service [NOMS]  assessment  of
         15 January 2013 still  rated  his  likelihood  of  reconviction  as
         'low'; but that must have referred  to  their  own  rating  system,
         rather than to ordinary English usage, since the  percentage  risks
         were 30% in one year, and 47% in two.



ERROR OF LAW?

 4. It is easy to see why the  judge  who   permission  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did so: the original grounds really do no more than  challenge
    Judge Jackson's proportionality assessment, on the basis of  the  facts
    she found. As the  permission  judge  rightly  remarked,  "While  other
    judges may not have come to the same conclusion, it  is  not  said  and
    cannot be said that her findings were perverse". Though  those  grounds
    were not withdrawn in the renewed ones before us, we  do  not  need  to
    linger on them: not only  was  the  judge's  assessment  of  the  facts
    themselves unchallengeable, but on some points she added her own shrewd
    observations.

 5. For example, in discussing the OASys report at paragraph 39, the  judge
    pointed out that it had been

         "... completed over eighteen months ago ... on the  basis  only  of
         the Appellant's account of the offence and where  he  continues  to
         refuse to  accept  responsibility  for  an  offence  which  he  was
         convicted by a jury of (with no appeal); I attach  less  weight  to
         the OASys assessment than I otherwise would."

 6. We regard the judge's decision, up to and including her  paragraph  43,
    as not open to any serious criticism at all. The appeal before us turns
    entirely on what she said at paragraphs 44 - 47. At  paragraph  44  she
    concluded, on the basis of her own findings  of  fact,  that  "...  the
    Appellant does represent a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat to one of the fundamental interests of  society",  in  terms  of
    public order and the prevention of crime.

 7. That was of course a reference to the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 [the EEA Regulations], which the judge  went  on
    to consider at 45. The relevant part appears at reg. 21:

         (5) Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of public  policy
         or public security it shall, in  addition  to  complying  with  the
         preceding paragraphs of this regulation,  be  taken  in  accordance
         with the following principles-

             (a)   the  decision  must  comply  with   the   principle   of
             proportionality;

             (b)  the decision must be based exclusively  on  the  personal
             conduct of the person concerned;

             (c)  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  concerned   must
             represent a genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the fundamental interests of society;

             (d)  matters isolated from the  particulars  of  the  case  or
             which relate to considerations of general  prevention  do  not
             justify the decision;

             (e)  a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
             themselves justify the decision.

         (6) Before taking a relevant decision  on  the  grounds  of  public
         policy or public security in relation to a person who  is  resident
         in the United Kingdom the  decision  maker  must  take  account  of
         considerations such  as  the  age,  state  of  health,  family  and
         economic situation of the person, the person's length of  residence
         in the United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural integration
         into the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with
         his country of origin.

 8. The judge had already accepted at 44 that the requirement  at  reg.  21
    (5) (c) was made out: given the present wording of sub-paragraphs  (b),
    (d) and (e), we do not think her decision is open to challenge  by  the
    Home Office on  the  basis  of  the  now  rather  ancient  decision  in
    Bouchereau [1977] EUECJ R-30/77. (We shall come back to that case  when
    we deal with Mr Yeo's submissions). Paragraph  (6)  sets  out  relevant
    considerations for  the  proportionality  decision,  required  by  sub-
    paragraph (a), and none of those taken into account  by  the  judge  at
    paragraphs 45 - 46 are  irrelevant.  Our  decision  turns  on  how  she
    reached her final conclusion, at 47, that the appellant's removal would
    be disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of , despite  the  strong
    finding she had already made  as  to  his  conduct  representing  "...a
    genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to  one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society".

 9. The judge's relevant findings of fact  at  45  -  46  were  these:  the
    appellant had been  living  lawfully,  studying  and  working  in  this
    country since 2004, and, though he hadn't lost his ties with Sri Lanka,
    since he still had family there, had been back  twice  on  visits,  and
    still spoke Tamil, he had stronger ties with the United Kingdom. He and
    his wife had had a strong marriage since 2009, even after he  was  sent
    to prison; and, although there was no evidence that  she  would  be  at
    risk on return to Sri Lanka, she was "at least subjectively fearful" of
    going back there, and had no intention of  doing  so,  her  own  family
    members being either in this country or in Germany.

10. We do not see any reason for any  of  those  findings  of  fact  to  be
    challenged, so far as they go; though  the  judge  might  perhaps  have
    reminded herself, that, though the appellant  had  been  here  lawfully
    throughout, so far as his immigration status was concerned, he  had  on
    the sentencing judge's findings been engaged in very  serious  criminal
    activity from 2009 - 11.

11. At paragraph 46 the judge went on to discuss a suggestion made  by  the
    presenting officer before her, and repeated by Mr Wilding before us. He
    argued that, even if the appellant were removed to Sri Lanka, it  would
    be open to him to seek lawful entry to Germany from  that  island.  The
    EEA Regulations were designed to enact the provisions of  the  relevant
    Directive of the Council of Ministers, by which Germany is also  bound,
    and it was entirely reasonable for the judge  to  assume  that  similar
    rules to those set out in reg. 21 would also apply there.

12. The judge may have gone wrong in theory, by assuming  without  evidence
    that Germany would operate rules on entry clearance  similar  to  those
    applying to these on removal; but  we  regard  that  as  a  distinction
    without any real difference. If the appellant were  removed  from  this
    country, then he would be barred entirely from seeking entry  clearance
    for another ten years, and any future application  might  meet  similar
    objections to his being here as those now raised.

13. While there is no evidence that the rules in Germany  are  similar,  we
    regard it as not unreasonable for the judge to have assumed  that  they
    would be as strict, or stricter in the case of someone  who  wanted  to
    move to that country, than one of someone facing  removal  to  another.
    There is no arguable challenge to this part of the judge's decision.

14. The difficulty comes, if at all, with the judge's final  paragraph  47,
    which is worth setting out in full:

         "In all of the  circumstances,  although  I  have  found  that  the
         appellant poses a genuine, present and sufficiently serious  threat
         in the United Kingdom, I do not find that his deportation would  be
         proportional to that threat, particularly taking into account  that
         he has been assessed as a low risk of reoffending  after  a  single
         offence (as opposed to  a  high  risk  of  reoffending  with  clear
         triggers or risks being identified or following a more  significant
         history of multiple convictions). I therefore allow the Appellant's
         appeal under the EEA Regulations."

15. If that paragraph had  stopped  at  "that  threat",  then  the  judge's
    decision might not have been open to challenge as  irrational;  but  it
    would have been open to serious challenge, in the circumstances of this
    case, as insufficiently reasoned, and the judge was quite right to give
    some further explanation for her main conclusion. The  real  difficulty
    with her decision lies in the way she set about that.

16. It is of course right that the appellant's likelihood  of  reconviction
    had been assessed as 'low', both by OASys in November 2012, and by NOMS
    in January 2013. That represented ordinary English usage, in  terms  of
    the percentage risks (10 - 19 %) found by  OASys;  but  the  judge  had
    discounted their conclusions, for the good reasons she gave herself, at
    paragraph 39 (see 5).

17. It follows that the judge must have reached  her  main  proportionality
    conclusion on the basis that the appellant's likelihood of reconviction
    within the next two years was low, on the basis of the NOMS report, and
    it is quite true that  this  is  how  they  classified  it  themselves.
    However, as we have already noted, a risk of 30 - 47 %  can  hardly  be
    called 'low', in terms of ordinary English usage; and, if it  had  been
    'low', in any reasonable use of the word in the context of  a  judicial
    decision, then that could not possibly have been  reconciled  with  the
    judge's own conclusion that the appellant  "...the  appellant  poses  a
    genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  in  the   United
    Kingdom".

18. On that basis, there was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
    decision which meant we needed to re-make it. Both sides  were  content
    for us to do so there and then on the  basis  of  further  submissions,
    which they went on to make; and, with one exception on the part  of  Mr
    Yeo, her conclusions on the facts.

DECISION RE-MADE

19. The only one of the judge's conclusions which Mr Yeo was  not  prepared
    to accept was as to the threat  posed  by  the  appellant.  The  r.  24
    response to the Home Office grounds of appeal (appellant's  solicitors'
    letter, 1 December 2014) did not  challenge  any  of  her  findings  or
    conclusions at all, and on that basis we are not prepared to  undertake
    a detailed reconsideration of all the facts before her for ourselves.

20. What we will do is to re-examine the judge's conclusions on  the  basis
    of her findings of fact, and of the parties' submissions on  this  part
    of the case, as well as considering further evidence to  which  Mr  Yeo
    referred us. He first mounted an  ingenious  challenge  to  her  threat
    conclusion, on the basis of Bouchereau . The passage he relied  on  was
    this: we shall set  it  out  in  full  here,  since  the  only  version
    available on line is in block capitals, and very hard to read.

         "27. The terms of article 3 (2) of the directive, which states that
             '  previous  criminal  convictions  shall  not  in  themselves
             constitute grounds for the taking of such measures '  must  be
             understood as requiring the national authorities to carry  out
             a specific appraisal from the point of view of  the  interests
             inherent in protecting  the  requirements  of  public  policy,
             which does not necessarily coincide with the appraisals  which
             formed the basis of the criminal conviction.

         28.   The  existence  of  a  previous  criminal   conviction   can,
             therefore, only be  taken  into  account  in  so  far  as  the
             circumstances which gave rise to that conviction are  evidence
             of personal conduct  constituting  a  present  threat  to  the
             requirements of public policy.

         29.  Although, in general, a finding  that  such  a  threat  exists
             implies  the  existence  in  the  individual  concerned  of  a
             propensity to act in  the  same  way  in  the  future,  it  is
             possible that past conduct alone may constitute such a  threat
             to the requirements of public policy.

         30.  It is for the authorities  and,  where  appropriate,  for  the
             national courts, to consider that question in each  individual
             case in the light of the particular legal position of  persons
             subject to community law and of the fundamental nature of  the
             principle of the free movement of persons"

21. Mr Yeo's argument was that, in view of that  paragraph  29,  the  judge
    might have based her threat conclusion solely on the  appellant's  past
    conduct. The short answer to this is that she did not: when  she  began
    her paragraph 44 "Taking into account the above in the round ...",  she
    clearly meant to refer to all her findings of fact from paragraph 35 to
    that point. The judge also went on from  the  threat  conclusion  which
    followed to mention the OASys and NOMS assessments, and to announce her
    conclusion in terms of "a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious
    threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of  society",  as  it
    now appears in reg. 21 (5) (c).

22. Whatever else was required under the terms of the Directive in force at
    the date of the decision in Bouchereau, the European Court  of  Justice
    there left open the possibility  that,  regardless  of  any  continuing
    propensity to the kind  of  criminal  conduct  in  question,  the  past
    conduct of the subject alone might constitute a present threat  to  the
    requirements of public policy. However, by the  date  of  the  decision
    under appeal in the present case, the terms of reg. 21 (5) as a  whole,
    and in particular the warnings that:

         "(d) matters isolated from the particulars of  the  case  or  which
         relate to considerations of general prevention do not  justify  the
         decision;"

    and

         "(e) a person's previous criminal convictions do not in  themselves
         justify the decision."

    make it quite clear that questions  of  deterrence,  or  of  expressing
    society's abhorrence of crime, are not to  be  taken  into  account  in
    assessing risk. There is no reason to suppose that the judge,  who  set
    out reg. 21 (5) in full for herself at paragraph 5, was  not  perfectly
    well aware of this.  As  Mr  Yeo  rightly  pointed  out  in  his  final
    submissions, replying to Mr Wilding, the present Regulations are  based
    on a new Directive, not in force at  the  time  of  Bouchereau  .  [The
    provisions behind the one we are considering are articles 27 and 28  of
    Directive 2004/38].

23. Mr Yeo went on to make further submissions, on the basis of  his  fresh
    evidence (contained in the supplementary bundle). That  took  the  case
    forward from where it had got to in the OASys assessment (a 10% risk of
    re-offending within one year, and 19% in two, classified as 'low'); and
    the  NOMS  one,  also  classified  as  'low',  but  on  the  basis   of
    corresponding figures of 30% and 47%. We should say  before  going  any
    further that we think the judge was quite right to discount  the  OASys
    assessment, and to prefer the NOMS one, for the  reasons  she  gave  at
    paragraph 44, and that is the basis on which we  shall  deal  with  the
    fresh evidence.

24. The first part of the fresh  evidence  to  which  Mr  Yeo  referred  us
    appears at pp 17 - 18 of  the  appellant's  supplementary  bundle,  and
    consists in an e-mail to his solicitors from a probation officer called
    Ruth Davie. It is relied on to answer what the judge said at  paragraph
    42 about there being

         "... no evidence that the Appellant has taken steps to address  his
         offending behaviour, in fact it would  be  surprising  if  he  had,
         given he maintains his innocence."

25. Also in the supplementary bundle at pp 15 - 16 are applications by  the
    appellant to the prison authorities, and their answers to them. On  two
    occasions in 2014 (29 August and 3 September), he  applied  to  do  the
    'Assertiveness and Decision-making' [ADM]  course;  on  the  second  he
    added a request for the 'Thinking Skills Programme'  [TSP].  The  first
    application got the answer that the ADM  course  was  not  run  at  the
    prison where he was being held; the second, not surprisingly a few days
    later, gave the same answer about the ADM: as for the TSP, the  officer
    dealing with it had looked at his current OASys assessment, and it  did
    not give TSP as a target.

26. Miss Davie says that the appellant  did  not  reach  the  criteria  for
    inclusion on any Probation accredited programme,  presumably  including
    both ADM and TSP, because he would need to score 50%  on  the  Offender
    Group Reconviction Score [OGRS], but was only rated at 10%. Clearly she
    was looking at the OASys, rather than the NOMS assessment,  and  taking
    the one-year, rather than the two-year reconviction rate; but we accept
    that the appellant has applied for courses, for which he turned out  to
    be ineligible.

27. Then there was a letter in the appellant's  original  bundle  from  the
    person in charge of one of the prison workshops.  The  judge  noted  at
    paragraph 24 that he had worked in a computer  refurbishment  workshop,
    so no doubt this was the one. We note in his favour  what  the  charge-
    hand said about his being very affable, extremely  diligent,  exemplary
    in his general demeanour, time-keeping and attendance.

SUBMISSIONS

28. Mr Yeo made the obvious general points about the appellant  being  non-
    violent, a first offender, and not involved in drug use; though we have
    to say  that,  like  the  sentencing  judge,  we  regard  his  help  in
    facilitation of drug-trafficking as a great deal more serious than mere
    use. It is also right to say that he is well educated, with a good work
    record even when at large, with a wife who is standing by him,  and  is
    'well-integrated' into society herself. This  makes  it  all  the  more
    surprising, and unnecessary, that he should  have  become  involved  in
    crime of this kind in the first place: his motive can  only  have  been
    greed.

29. Mr Wilding referred us to  Tsakouridis  (European  citizenship)  [2010]
    EUECJ C-145/09, and in particular to paragraphs 49 - 53. We do not need
    to set those out in full: the issue was about whether a conviction  for
    dealing in narcotics could involve the necessary 'imperative grounds of
    public security' for the removal of someone with ten  years'  residence
    in the country in question.  The  two  preceding  paragraphs  are  also
    relevant, as we pointed out at the hearing:

         "47. Since  drug  addiction  represents  a  serious  evil  for  the
         individual and is  fraught  with  social  and  economic  danger  to
         mankind ... trafficking in narcotics as part of an organised  group
         could reach a level of intensity that might directly  threaten  the
         calm and physical security of the population as a whole or a  large
         part of it.

         48.  It should be added that Article  27(2)  of  Directive  2004/38
         emphasises that the conduct of the person concerned must  represent
         a genuine and present threat to a fundamental interest  of  society
         or  of  the  Member  State  concerned,   that   previous   criminal
         convictions cannot in  themselves  constitute  grounds  for  taking
         public policy or public security measures, and that  justifications
         that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely  on
         considerations of general prevention cannot be accepted."

30. Paragraph 49 mentions the need for dealing with the individual case, in
    terms of the necessity for removal the person concerned; 50  -  51  for
    the usual balancing exercise, including "the risk of  compromising  the
    social rehabilitation of the Union citizen in the State in which he has
    become genuinely integrated, which ... is not only in his interest  but
    also in that of the European Union in general". Paragraph 52  is  about
    the fundamental rights the principle of freedom of movement is designed
    to protect.

31. Paragraphs 53 - 54 we shall again set out in full, apart from Maslov v.
    Austria - 1638/03 [2008] ECHR 546,  about  people  brought  up  in  the
    country from which they face removal, which does not  apply  here,  and
    other citations.

         "53   To  assess   whether   the   interference   contemplated   is
         proportionate to the legitimate  aim  pursued,  in  this  case  the
         protection of public security, account must be taken in  particular
         of the  nature  and  seriousness  of  the  offence  committed,  the
         duration of residence of the person concerned in  the  host  Member
         State, the period which has passed since the offence was  committed
         and the conduct of the person concerned during that period, and the
         solidity of the social, cultural and  family  ties  with  the  host
         Member State. In the case of a Union citizen who has lawfully spent
         most or even all of his childhood and  youth  in  the  host  Member
         State, very good reasons would have to be put  forward  to  justify
         the expulsion measure (see, to that effect, in  particular,  Maslov
         v. Austria, �� 71 to 75).

         54   In any event, since the Court has held  that  a  Member  State
         may, in the interests of public policy, consider that  the  use  of
         drugs constitutes a danger for society such as to  justify  special
         measures against foreign nationals who contravene its laws on drugs
         ... it must  follow  that  dealing  in  narcotics  as  part  of  an
         organised group is a fortiori covered by  the  concept  of  'public
         policy' for the purposes of Article 28(2) of Directive 2004/38."

32. Mr Wilding also  referred  to  Essa  (EEA:  rehabilitation/integration)
    [2013] UKUT (IAC) 316, as summarized in the judicial head-note:

         "3.  For those who at the time of determination  are  or  remain  a
             present threat to public policy but where the factors relevant
             to integration suggest that there are reasonable prospects  of
             rehabilitation, those prospects can be a substantial  relevant
             factor  in  the  proportionality   balance   as   to   whether
             deportation is justified. If the claimant cannot constitute  a
             present threat when rehabilitated,  and  is  well-advanced  in
             rehabilitation in a host state where there  is  a  substantial
             degree  of   integration,   it   may   well   very   well   be
             disproportionate to proceed to deportation.

         4.   At the other end of the scale,  if  there  are  no  reasonable
             prospects of rehabilitation, the claimant is a present  threat
             and is likely to remain  so  for  the  indefinite  future,  it
             cannot be seen  how  the  prospects  of  rehabilitation  could
             constitute  a  significant  factor  in  the   balance.   Thus,
             recidivist offenders, career criminals,  adult  offenders  who
             have failed to engage  with  treatment  programmes,  claimants
             with propensity to commit sexual or violent offences  and  the
             like may well fall into this category.

         5.   What is likely to be valuable to a judge  in  the  immigration
             jurisdiction who is considering risk factors is the extent  of
             any progress made by a person during the sentence and  licence
             period, and any material shift in  OASys  assessment  of  that
             person."

CONCLUSIONS

33. We are prepared to accept that the judge was entitled to take the  view
    that this  appellant  was  unlikely  to  be  let  into  Germany,  where
    otherwise he could have joined his wife: there may not  have  been  any
    evidence about that, but we think she was perfectly  entitled  to  take
    judicial notice of the fact that states generally, like  this  country,
    have rules on admitting people more restrictive than the  criteria  for
    excluding them, once they are in. It followed that she was entitled  to
    assume that he would have stood to be refused admission to Germany  for
    the same, or similar reasons as those on which the Home Office  decided
    to refuse him a residence card,  based  as  they  are  on  a  Directive
    binding on all member states of the EEA.

34. The result, if we were to uphold the decision under  appeal,  would  be
    that the appellant and his wife faced a stark choice: either she  would
    have to return with him to their country of origin, leaving behind  all
    the advantages of being an EEA citizen, and her own family here and  in
    Germany, besides what she has gained by her own hard work;  or  to  let
    him go back to Sri Lanka without her, losing the  chance  of  any  real
    married life, or the hope of having children together, except for  what
    at her age must now be the diminishing chance of conception as a result
    of visiting him there. The appellant's wife has  also  what  the  judge
    found to be a  subjectively  genuine  fear  of  return  to  Sri  Lanka:
    however, as the judge rightly pointed out, there is no evidence of  her
    facing any real risk there.

35. This is a stark choice, and not one which the appellant's wife deserves
    to have forced on her: she may well have been unaware of his offending,
    though we cannot help wondering whether she must to  some  extent  have
    shut her eyes to the improvement in their joint finances likely to have
    been brought about by his handling sums of the kind  involved,  over  a
    period of more than a year, as the sentencing judge found. However,  if
    that is to be  the  result,  it  will  be  one  brought  about  by  the
    appellant's own criminal conduct.

36. We come back to the judge's finding, which we  have  upheld,  that  the
    appellant's personal conduct does represent  a  'genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society'. One good reason why that  is  the  case  is  that  he  was
    involved, at whatever level, in serious organized crime, relating, even
    if indirectly, to the supply of narcotics:  see  the  passages  already
    cited from  Tsakouridis .

37. Against that, the factors set out in reg. 21 (6) have of course  to  be
    considered too: in our view (and neither side suggested otherwise) they
    quite adequately cover the principles set out in Tsakouridis, including
    the potential public, as well as individual benefit from  any  possible
    social reintegration.

         age
         41 is a reasonable age for moving back to one's country of origin.

         health
         There is no evidence of the appellant's having any problems here.

         family and economic situation
         We have already discussed the situation of the appellant's wife. As
         for his economic situation, the letter of 19 April 2013
         (supplementary bundle p 20) shows that he was due to pay just under
         �1050 under a confiscation order no later than 16 September that
         year, in default of which he would be liable to 28 days'
         imprisonment consecutively to his sentence. We were referred to no
         evidence as to whether or not he had done that; but in any case the
         order would for practical purposes be unenforceable in Sri Lanka.
         There is no evidence of the appellant's having any particular
         source of income there; but, as a well-educated enterprising man
         who lived there till he was over 30, we see no reason why he should
         not be able to support himself on the island.

         length of residence in the United Kingdom
         The appellant was here, with leave to remain as a student and a
         work permit holder from 2004 till 2012, and was, if he had not
         become involved in crime, entitled to be here as the husband of an
         EEA citizen from 2008 onwards.

         social and cultural integration into the United Kingdom
         The appellant was always in work while at large; but nevertheless
         he was involved in serious crime from 2009 till he was arrested in
         2010. The only personal relationship to which we were referred in
         submissions was with his wife.

         links with country of origin
         There is no particular evidence on this to which we were referred,
         so we remain at the default position of assuming that, at 41 and
         having lived there till he was 31, he is more likely than not to
         have retained some significant ones.

38.  Balancing  the  'genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society'  represented  by
    the appellant's presence here against those factors we  have  noted  as
    being in his favour, in terms of the scale set out in Essa, this is our
    view of the case as a whole. While he does not come directly  into  the
    categories set out in paragraph 4 of the head-note, his criminal career
    having lasted only from 2009 till it was cut short  by  his  arrest  in
    2010, he was involved in serious organized crime,  connected  with  the
    supply of narcotics, even if, as the sentencing judge noted, those were
    not class 'A' drugs.

39. The appellant has good reports about his conduct in prison;  but  there
    is nothing in the OASys and NOMS assessments  to  indicate  any  actual
    progress in his attitude  to  his  offending;  nor,  as  Judge  Jackson
    rightly noted, was this very likely while he continued to deny  it,  as
    he did till three days before our hearing. He had a  good  work  record
    while at large; but, apart from his relationship with his wife, and  no
    doubt other family members, there is no evidence of any other  form  of
    social integration into this country.

40.  Taking  all  these  things  together,  we  have  no  doubt  that  this
    appellant's removal would be proportionate to the legitimate purpose of
    .
