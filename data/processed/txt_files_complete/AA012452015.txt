                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS
Anonymity order

Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
Appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings.

                           Decision and directions

1. The appellant is an Afghan citizen, born in 1993  and  therefore  now  23
   years old.  He appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
   tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the respondent's  refusal  to
   grant him  international  protection  under  the  Refugee  Convention  or
   humanitarian protection grounds, or  leave  to  remain  on  human  rights
   grounds.

2. At the hearing today, the respondent accepted that the reasoning  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal was inconsistent and could not stand.    Accordingly,
   the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  will  be  set  aside  and  the
   decision will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed,
   with no findings  of  fact  and  credibility  preserved,  save  that  the
   appellant is an Afghan and is at risk in his home area (see paragraphs 72-
   73 and 75 in particular).  The Judge's findings as to  the  risk  to  the
   appellant in the rest of Afghanistan are not preserved.

3. It was agreed at the hearing that  this  appeal  is  not  suitable  as  a
   potential country guidance case.

4. The appeal is remitted for hearing afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

Directions

5. I give the following directions for the future conduct of this appeal:

   a) The decision in this appeal will be remade in the First-tier  Tribunal
      with a time estimate of  ï¿½  a  day.   A  Pashtu  interpreter  will  be
      required.

   b) The positive findings at [72]-[72] and [75] of  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier Tribunal are preserved.

   c) No other findings of fact or credibility are to be preserved.

DECISION

6. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.
    I set aside the previous decision.
    The decision in this appeal will be remade in the  First-tier  Tribunal
    on a date to be fixed.
