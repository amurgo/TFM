For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal of Mohammed Ishaque who was born  on  15  March  1994
    and although in  the  refusal  decision  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    carelessly stated that the appellant applied for entry clearance  as  a
    spouse and quoted the wrong paragraph number of the Rules, in  fact  he
    is a dependant child and it was agreed between the parties at the First-
    tier Tribunal that rather than remitting it back to the Entry Clearance
    Officer for consideration under  the  correct  paragraph,  the  hearing
    should proceed as if the refusal had been under paragraph  297(iv)  and
    (v).  In fact during the course of the hearing it was agreed  that  the
    only issue outstanding was the issue  of  maintenance.   Judge  Clayton
    dismissed the appeal under the Rules and under Article  8  having  gone
    through  the  various  documents  and  made  findings   as   to   their
    reliability.

2.   Detailed grounds seeking permission to appeal  were  submitted  setting
    out a calculation and, although  permission  to  appeal  was  initially
    refused, it was subsequently granted with particular  reference  to  an
    HMRC letter referring to amended tax credits for the year 2012 to  2013
    which appears at page 7 of a  bundle  that  starts  with  the  skeleton
    argument that was submitted.  That letter Mr Bramble had some  concerns
    about because it was based on information that had been provided by the
    appellant's father to HMRC  and  he  drew  particular  attention  to  a
    paragraph in that letter which says, "please tell  us  if  your  income
    goes up or it goes down, this helps us to keep  your  payments  on  the
    right track".

3.   Mr Bramble however had not seen a letter which had been sent in by  the
    appellant's solicitors after the conclusion of the hearing before Judge
    Clayton but before she determined the appeal.  That is a  letter  dated
    17 January 2013 from HM Revenue and Customs  which  confirms  that  the
    sponsor i.e. the father of the appellant's  income  for  the  tax  year
    2011/2012 accords with the information given in terms  of  tax  credits
    and with the evidence that he gave at the appellant's  hearing,  namely
    he had an income of �8,253 for that year and paid tax of  �154.80.   Mr
    Bramble very properly agreed that the judge ought to have taken account
    of that letter and that it would have affected her  assessment  of  the
    other documents.  It is difficult to tell from the file  whether  Judge
    Clayton in fact saw that letter and she of course cannot be  criticised
    for reaching the decision she  did  in  the  absence  of  such  letter.
    However the fact remains that the content of that letter ought to  have
    been taken into account.

4.   Mr Bramble again very properly agrees that now on  the  basis  of  that
    evidence there is  adequate  maintenance  to  financially  support  the
    appellant without recourse to additional public funds.   Going  through
    the calculations that were provided by the  appellant's  solicitors  in
    the grounds seeking permission to appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    there were some disagreements with that to the extent that on the basis
    of income available the figure is �391.34, that the  benefit  threshold
    is �310.34 thus showing a surplus of �79  per  week  which  means  that
    there is adequate maintenance and thus the appeal is successful.

5.   Accordingly, there is an error of law in  the  determination  by  Judge
    Clayton in that she failed to take  account  of  a  relevant  document,
    albeit quite possibly a document of which she was not aware and as such
    the decision is set aside and I re-make the decision on  the  basis  of
    the information I have set out above and allow the appeal.
