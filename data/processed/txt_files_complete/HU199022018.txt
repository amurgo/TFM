Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Moriarty instructed by Everest Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms S Cunha, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nepalese national born on 30th December 1977, and he
    appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Seelhoff
    dismissing  his  appeal  and  promulgated  on  1st  August  2019.   The
    appellant's father served in the Gurkha Regiment between 1948 and 1963.
     The family lived together until 2006 when the father died.  The mother
    was granted settlement in the United Kingdom but did not travel to  the
    United Kingdom until 2011.  The  appellant's  five  siblings  were  all
    married and lived in Nepal.

 2. The grounds of appeal were as follows:

         Ground (i) the judge failed to apply the correct  test  for  family
         life between adults  and  made  errors  in  the  treatment  of  the
         evidence, particularly that of the mother's evidence.

         Ground (ii) the judge having erred in his approach to the test  for
         family life failed to proceed to  consider  Article  8(2)  and  the
         proportionality assessment.

 3. Ground (i) On the judge's own findings, at paragraph  10,  he  accepted
    that  there  were  seven  money  transfer  receipts  addressed  to  the
    appellant from his mother  over  a  period  of  approximately  eighteen
    months and accepted  the  money  transfer  receipts  to  the  appellant
    totalled approximately �550.  As held in Kugathas v Secretary of  State
    for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 311  the  test  for  Article  8
    family life between adults was  whether  "something  more  exists  than
    normal emotional ties".  "Dependence" is one way such ties could  exist
    and  it  meant  "real  support",  "effective  support"  or   "committed
    support".  It was submitted that in Ghising (family  life  -  adults  -
    Ghurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 160 that Kugathas had been interpreted  too
    restrictively in the past and that what may constitute an extant family
    life could fall well short of dependency: see Patel and Others v  Entry
    Clearance Officer (Mumbai) [2010] EWCA Civ 17.

 4. Further, even voluntary separation did  not  end  family  life:  Sen  v
    Netherlands [2003].

 5. The judge erred in finding that the test was not met by failing to have
    regard to the relevant evidence and stated:

         "The money transfer receipts I have do not corroborate the  claimed
         level of support.  The Appellant's evidence was that she sent money
         to her son every 1 to 2 months and it would be about �100  a  time.
         I have seven receipts for transfers to the Appellant in an 18 month
         period and some  of  the  transfers  are  for  as  little  as  �50"
         (paragraph 16).

    It was submitted that the record of the  proceedings  showed  that  the
    judge had not had regard to the mother's oral evidence on the point and
    that she had indeed confirmed that sometimes  �50  was  sent  and  that
    sometimes she could not send  it  regularly  every  month.   Thus,  the
    mother's evidence, even on the judge's own record, was consistent.

 6. Further, the judge criticised the evidence on the basis  he  could  not
    evaluate the mother's financial circumstances.  He recorded he had been
    provided with no UK bank statements for  the  sponsor  and  no  way  to
    properly evaluate how much money she had or was actually  sent  to  the
    appellant,  [paragraph  16].   However,  the  judge  did  not  consider
    paragraphs  23  to  24  of  the  mother's  witness  statement  in   the
    appellant's bundle which she adopted as evidence (having confirmed that
    it had been translated back to her in Nepali) that she received pension
    credit of:

         "�108.32 per week, housing benefit of �168.54 fortnightly.  I spend
         money only for my basic needs.  I  save  the  money  for  my  son's
         maintenance.  My son is totally financially  dependent  on  me.   I
         have been sending money via IME.  I receive widow pension of around
         NRs 30,000 which is directly deposited into Everest  Bank  Limited.
         I used to withdraw the pension funds during my visits to Nepal.   I
         handed over the money to my  son.   I  did  not  authorise  him  to
         withdraw the pension funds as he may misuse it".

    The judge had not had regard to any of this evidence.

 7. Further, the judge had regard to irrelevant matters including the issue
    of whether payments were sent to the married brothers.  The question in
    this case was the relationship between the appellant and his mother and
    it was irrelevant that he sent money to the married brothers.

 8. Additionally, the judge erred in failing to give regard to the document
    from the Jaimini Municipality.  The English translation  was  imperfect
    ("he was no involved in any government and non-government  organisation
    is certified") but it was tolerably clear that the meaning was that  as
    at the date of the certificate, the appellant was not in employment  in
    any government job or in any  non-government  job.   The  document  was
    signed, dated and had given the address of the authority and it  was  a
    type that had been accepted by  the  Tribunal  in  many  other  Ghurkha
    appeals.

 9. Further, the judge found at paragraphs 19, 20 and 22 that he could  not
    accept the evidence on addresses owing  to  the  discrepancies  in  the
    name, but the mother gave evidence under re-examination that the  names
    of the regions had been changed and this was not considered.

10. At paragraph 23  the  judge  found  "on  the  evidence  before  me  the
    appellant himself is some  sort  of  subsistence  farmer  at  the  very
    least".  This was, however, inconsistent with and did not consider  the
    appellant's mother's evidence that the appellant lived  in  the  former
    family home which had a modest garden attached where  the  family  grew
    beans and cucumbers and she specifically explained that  he  could  not
    survive by growing vegetables alone and needed the additional resources
    sent by his mother. The sponsor confirmed that he could not  manage  to
    live on the food he grew.

11. Taken cumulatively, the evidence pointed to the family life  under  the
    test in Kugathas being satisfied.

12. The appellant had lived with his parents and then his mother  following
    the death of his father in 2006, until his mother travelled to  the  UK
    without him in 2011 and they had  maintained  regular  contact  through
    telephone calls and visits and this evidence  had  been  shown  in  the
    bundle.  Secondly, there was financial dependence of the  appellant  on
    the mother who provided all of his income as confirmed by  the  witness
    statement and the remittance receipts  and  the  statement  of  Everest
    Bank.  Thirdly, there was dependence for the  roof  over  his  head  in
    Bara, Nepal as confirmed in the mother's  statement.   Fourthly,  there
    were the emotional ties, the appellant was the only child who  was  not
    married and had not founded a family of his own.

13. The judge had erred in failing to apply the correct approach to Article
    8(1) of the ECHR: Rai v Entry Clearance Officer [2017] EWCA Civ 320.

14. Ground (ii) - the judge did not go on to apply Article 8(2) because  he
    concluded Article 8(1) was not engaged but the key point was  that  the
    appellant's father would have settled in the UK, if permitted, when  he
    was discharged from the Ghurkha Regiment after his  exemplary  service.
    He thus suffered the historic injustice, which, had  it  not  happened,
    the appellant would have  been  born  in  the  UK.   The  injustice  to
    Ghurkhas was corrected partially in 2009 but by then the appellant  was
    an adult aged 31 years.  No provisions were made in the 2009 policy for
    Ghurkha children aged over 18.  The  injustice  of  excluding  children
    aged over 18 was not addressed until the policy in  Annex  K  permitted
    applications for those aged 18 to 30 years but by  then  the  appellant
    was aged 37.  At every point in 1963, 1977, 2009, 2015 and now in  2019
    his family had  been  directly  affected  by  the  continuing  historic
    injustice and the appellant was marooned in  Nepal  seeking  settlement
    that he should never have needed to request.  A bad immigration history
    or criminal behaviour may tip the balance in  the  respondent's  favour
    but all that is relied on is the public interest side of  the  balance.
    Against the interests of immigration control "the weight to be given to
    the  historic  injustice  will  normally  require  a  decision  in  the
    appellant's favour": Ghising  &  Ors  (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong;
    weight) [2013] UKUT 567.  All the matters set out in Section  117B  are
    "the interests of immigration control" and there were no countervailing
    considerations in this matter.

    Analysis

15.  We  have  set  out  above  the  relevant  components  required  to  be
    established in order to found family life and  particularly  note  that
    Ghising (family life - adults - Ghurkha policy) held that the judgments
    in Kugathas had been "interpreted too restrictively  in  the  past  and
    ought to be read in the  light  of  the  subsequent  decisions  of  the
    domestic and Strasbourg courts".

16. As set out at paragraph 19 of Rai, to which  we  have  referred  above,
    which emphasised the point made by Lord Dyson in Gurung v Secretary  of
    State [2013] EWCA Civ "the question whether an individual enjoys family
    life is one of fact and depends on a careful consideration of  all  the
    relevant facts of the particular case".   Each  case  is  highly  fact-
    sensitive and as held in Singh  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  630  "there  is  no  legal  or   factual
    presumption as to the existence or  absence  of  family  life  for  the
    purposes of Article 8".

17. It has not been challenged that this is the adult child of the  sponsor
    and that one of the factors when considering family life is whether the
    adult child has founded a family life of his own, which  in  this  case
    the appellant has not.  In this case Ms Cunha argued before us that the
    judge disbelieved the evidence that was put before him finding that  he
    had not received a truthful or  complete  picture  of  the  appellant's
    circumstances in Nepal, for example stating that  there  was  a  severe
    lack of information and that he had been  provided  with  "no  UK  bank
    statements for the sponsor and no way to  properly  evaluate  how  much
    money she has or how much is actually sent to the appellant.  The money
    transfer receipts I have  do  not  corroborate  the  claimed  level  of
    support".

18. We find force in the grounds that the judge overlooked, misconstrued or
    failed to factor in all the relevant evidence.

19. The judge at paragraph 12 indeed recorded that the  sponsor  said  that
    she sends �50 to �100 to her son every two months and all the money was
    sent through a money transfer service.  The judge  erred  therefore  in
    proceeding at paragraph 16 to criticise the evidence because the mother
    said she sent "�100 a time" but he found that  some  of  the  transfers
    were for as little as �50.  That, however, contradicted his own  record
    of the evidence and thus his reasoning.  As such, it would appear  that
    the judge had no regard to that aspect of the mother's  oral  evidence.
    Her evidence appeared consistent.

20. Further, there was a bank statement in relation  to  the  Everest  Bank
    account in Nepal and whether or not there was a bank statement  in  the
    UK did not undermine the fact that transfer receipts  were  present  in
    the bundle showing transfers to the appellant in the sum of �550.  That
    was indeed a finding made specifically on the documents in relation  to
    the transfer receipts to the appellant and recorded  at  paragraph  10.
    That was a finding made on the documents and independently  of  whether
    the mother had disclosed her bank statement in the UK.  The money  that
    she received allowed her to send remittances.  The mother did  set  out
    in her witness statement the pension credit  and  housing  benefit  she
    received in the UK.  She  also  disclosed  an  Everest  Bank  statement
    detailing the pension she received each month  in  Nepal  during  2017,
    being approximately 29,024 naira.

21. The judge noted at paragraph 4 that it was stated  that  the  appellant
    studied up until class 10 but was not good  at  school  and  had  never
    worked in Nepal but "does occasional  seasonal  agricultural  work  for
    land owners to earn some money according to  his  mother's  statement".
    This noted that the work was  seasonal  but  did  not  reflect  in  the
    findings regarding 'support' that the work was only seasonal as opposed
    to regular and nor did it acknowledge the statement of the mother  that
    without the funds given to him he would be unable to subsist.

22. At paragraph 17 the judge took issue with the  fact  that  the  sponsor
    changed her answer as to whether money was sent only to  the  appellant
    but it is quite clear in the documentary evidence provided  that  money
    was sent to the family as a whole and also separately to the appellant.
     Ms Cunha advanced that the judge's criticism was well-founded  but  as
    observed by the grounds of appeal the concentration  by  the  judge  on
    passing money to the siblings was not wholly relevant to whether  money
    transfers were made to the appellant himself.  The judge asserted  that
    there had been a change of evidence, but it is clear from the documents
    what the position was as to the transfers and this was what was  indeed
    confirmed by the sponsor in re-examination.  The judge did  not  appear
    to take this into account.  The mother  stated  that  she  thought  she
    might have sent money to the brother when the appellant was ill but the
    judge resisted this explanation on the basis that money was sent  three
    different times and sent to the appellant  himself  independently  only
    four days after sending the money to the brother because the  appellant
    was said to be ill. That does not necessarily undermine the explanation
    but moreover does not counter the documentary  evidence  which  clearly
    shows that money was sent to the appellant individually.

23. Further, the amount sent to the brothers is not wholly  relevant.   The
    critical question as set out at paragraph 40 of  Rai  is  whether  "the
    appellant himself still enjoyed a family life with his parents".   That
    consideration must be whether or not there is still a family life  with
    the siblings, which in this case there is not because the siblings have
    clearly set up their own independent lives because  they  are  married.
    Thus, we consider that the judge concentrated overly  on  the  position
    with regards the siblings.  It is irrelevant that the appellant  is  or
    is not the only child she sends money.

24. The judge also made criticism of the credibility of the evidence on the
    basis of the address, such that the appellant's own address was  listed
    as something quite different on the application form.

25. At paragraph 22 the judge asserts:

         "Another issues (sic) is that the Appellant is said to  have  lived
         with his mother prior to her departure from Nepal.  The  difficulty
         I have with that is that on documents  from  Nepal  his  mother  is
         listed as 'permanent residents of Jaiminie municipality Ward number
         nine (former: Paiyunthanthap VDC Ward No 2' whereas the Appellant's
         address is listed quite clearly as Ward number 14 in any area which
         I also note is called neither Bara nor Baglung on the  application.
         There is no explanation for this discrepancy".

26. However, the judge does not appear to acknowledge  the  explanation  of
    the mother  that  the  place  names  had  changed.   We  note  that  at
    paragraphs 11 and 13 of her witness statement, the  sponsor  refers  to
    both Baglung and then to Bara as being their  property  and  where  the
    appellant is said to live.  The application form in  fact  records  the
    appellant's address as Ward 14 and being in Bara [question  22  of  the
    entry clearance application form].

27. Again, as the grounds contest, the mother's evidence was  not  properly
    considered by the judge.

28. At paragraph 20, the judge stated that the appellant's brother Tika was
    listed in the money transfer receipts as  living  in  Samara  which  is
    incorrect.  The address on the remittances to the brother is Simara and
    wholly different from either Baglung (the address  on  the  appellant's
    remittances) or Bara.  Further, whether or not the appellant's brothers
    were involved in arranging money transfers to him when he is  ill  does
    not necessarily have bearing on whether  those  siblings  wish  to  see
    their mother on her visits to Nepal.

29.  Turning  to  the  consideration  of  the  appellant  working  and  the
    requirement for support, it was not the appellant's  evidence  nor  the
    sponsor's evidence that he had never been employed in Nepal but that he
    had been working seasonally.  The phrase "he was  no  involved  in  any
    government and non-government organisation is certified"  involved  two
    different tenses and suggest difficulty  in  the  translation  but  the
    document suggests that he is not currently involved  in  government  or
    non-government work,  although  owing  to  the  poor  translation  only
    limited weight can be accorded to this document.

30. At paragraph 23 the judge acknowledges that the appellant is some  sort
    of subsistence farmer and that assessing the evidence in the  round  he
    was not satisfied the account had been accurate or truthful.

31. We find on analysis the grounds are made out, because the judge  failed
    to take into account  all  of  the  relevant  evidence  and  failed  to
    undertake the requisite careful consideration of all the relevant facts
    of the appellant's case in the light of the principles and guidance  to
    be derived from the authorities.  He left out of account important  and
    relevant  evidence  as  to  the   family   life.    There   were   also
    contradictions  in  the  approach  to  the  evidence  which   we   have
    highlighted.  We consider those deficiencies in the  treatment  of  the
    evidence to be material.   As a result of the flawed  approach  to  the
    evidence the finding on family life is not safe  and  consequently  the
    failure to determine Article 8(2) was also a material legal error.

32. We therefore set aside the determination and re-make the decision.

33. It is clear that the appellant is the son of the sponsor and  that  she
    appeared to be living with him prior to her departure  from  Nepal  for
    the UK.  There are documents including the certificate of  relationship
    apparently dated 2009 which record the appellant and sponsor as  having
    lived at the same address.  The  Police  character  verification  dated
    March 2018 records the appellant living at Ward No 2.  We note that the
    verification of being unmarried and the recommendation in  relation  to
    work from the Jaiminie Municipality record the  appellant  as  being  a
    "permanent resident of Ward number nine (former Paiyunthanthap VCD Ward
    No 2".  There is no indication of how the various authorities delineate
    the districts.  The mother gave evidence that Baglung had  changed  its
    name and was now Bara.  All that said, even if the  appellant  did  not
    still live in the family home it does not mean that  family  life  does
    not pertain for the reasons given below.  Overall the documentation led
    us to conclude that there was family life when the sponsor departed for
    the United Kingdom from Nepal.

34. We accept that  there  was  sufficient  information  on  the  sponsor's
    income.  The  financial  documentation,  including  the  Everest   Bank
    statements showed the pension that the mother received, and her witness
    statement confirmed the housing benefit and pension credit she received
    in the United Kingdom.  With regard the remittances to  the  appellant,
    there were a series of money transfer receipts to the appellant via RIA
    Financial Services Limited and those transfers commenced on 27th August
    2017 with a transfer  of  approximately  �100  and  continued  to  24th
    December 2018.  We accept  the  sponsor's  evidence  that  she  visited
    Nepal, indeed her visits have been set out below, and would give  money
    to the appellant when there. The appellant's mother confirmed  that  he
    did occasional seasonal agricultural work and earned pocket  money  and
    grew some vegetables but that she was principally responsible  for  his
    welfare and maintenance. Her pension is paid into her account in  Nepal
    and she was frank that she did not wish to  give  him  power  over  her
    account there lest he misuse it and it seems natural that she would, as
    a mother give money to her intermittently employed  son  when  visiting
    him.

35. On the basis of the evidence overall, we accept that the  appellant  is
    financially supported  by  his  mother  even  if  he  is  not  entirely
    financially dependent upon her.

36. We take into account the witness statement of the sponsor who explained
    that her husband died in 2006, that there was no  settlement  provision
    for her husband until his death and that she could not make  settlement
    applications straight away owing to her  financial  difficulties.   She
    entered the United Kingdom on 1st  July  2011  some  months  after  the
    expiry of her settlement visa, but she could not include her  son,  the
    appellant, because he was over the  age  of  18.   She  identified  the
    visits which had taken place to Nepal in February to May 2013, November
    to January 2014 to 2015,  May  2015  to  June  2015,  January  2017  to
    February 2017, November 2017 to December  2017,  and  January  2019  to
    March 2019.  She  confirmed  that  she  provided  emotional  and  moral
    support to her son and organised his basic needs during her  visits  to
    Nepal.  She explained she could no longer travel to Nepal owing to  her
    age and the flights were too expensive.  She confirmed at paragraph  24
    of her statement that her son was totally financially dependent on  her
    and that when she goes to Nepal she would draw pension funds  and  give
    him money whilst there but  did  not  authorise  him  to  withdraw  the
    pension funds for fear that he may misuse them.

37. In our analysis of the evidence which includes the photographs  of  the
    visits of the mother to the appellant in Nepal and  the  phone  records
    from 2017 onwards, we accept that there has been and  remains  a  close
    relationship between  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  and  from  the
    documentation that the appellant remains unmarried.

38. We find that family life remains engaged.  The test does not deman some
    extraordinary  or  exceptional  feature  but  a  sufficient  degree  of
    financial support and emotional dependence which we find is present and
    that constitutes family life.  We find the support from the Sponsor  to
    the appellant 'committed' and 'real'.

39. Turning to proportionality in relation  to  Article  8(2),  significant
    weight must be attached to the historic injustice which  will  normally
    be  enough  to  cause  the  proportionality  balance  to  fall  in  the
    appellant's favour: see Ghising & Ors (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong;
    weight) at paragraphs 59 to  60.   Exceptional  circumstances  are  not
    required, and it is for the Secretary of State to justify a decision to
    refuse leave to enter or remain in the United  Kingdom  when  the  only
    countervailing consideration is the public interest  in  maintaining  a
    firm immigration policy.  The requirement to take into account historic
    injustice is entailed in striking a fair balance as held  in  Rai.   In
    relation to the Section 117A and B of the Nationality, Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 the provisions do not affect the outcome of the  appeal
    because in view of the historic  injustice  underlying  the  case  such
    considerations would make no difference to the outcome.

40. The question said to be pertinent in Rai is whether family life existed
    when the sponsor departed from Nepal and whether it endured.   We  find
    that both requirements are fulfilled.  As held in Rai at paragraph 42

    'the fact that he and his parents would have applied at the  same  time
    for leave to enter the United Kingdom and would have come to the United
    Kingdom together as a family unit had they been able to  afford  to  do
    so, do not appear to have been grappled  with  by  the  Upper  Tribunal
    judge under article 8(1). In my view they should have been.  They  went
    to the heart of the matter: the question of whether,  even  though  the
    appellant's parents had chosen to leave Nepal to settle in  the  United
    Kingdom when they did, his family life with them  subsisted  then,  and
    was still subsisting at the time of the Upper Tribunal's decision. This
    was the critical question under article 8(1)'.

41.  On  the  proportionality  assessment   we   find   no   countervailing
    considerations  to  displace  the  weight  attached  to  the   historic
    injustice. As such, we therefore find  the  decision  to  refuse  entry
    clearance was disproportionate.

42.  We set  aside  the  decision  pursuant  to  Section  12(2)(a)  of  the
    Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE  2007)  and  remake  the
    decision under section 12(2) (b) (ii) of  the  TCE  2007.   Mr  Thapa's
    appeal is allowed.

Appeal Allowed.
