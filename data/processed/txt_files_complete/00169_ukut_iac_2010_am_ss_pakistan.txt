Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

A joint account bearing  the  name  of  the  applicant  meets  the  relevant
evidential requirements of paras 93-96 of the Tier 1  Guidance,  so  further
evidence of the ownership of the funds in the account is not required.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellants, husband and wife,  are  nationals  of  Pakistan.  They
      appealed to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal against  the  decision
      of the Secretary of State on 9 July 2009 refusing to vary their  leave
      in order to allow them to remain in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  first
      Appellant as a  Tier  1  (post-study  work)  migrant  and  the  second
      Appellant as his dependant. Immigration Judge Raymond dismissed  their
      appeals.  The  Appellants   sought   and   obtained   an   order   for
      reconsideration. By virtue  of  paragraph  4  of  Schedule  4  to  the
      Transfer of Functions of the Asylum and Immigration  Order  2010,  the
      reconsideration continues as an appeal to this Tribunal.

   2. At the hearing before us there was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of
      either Appellant. They had been properly served  with  notice  of  the
      hearing, and we decided to proceed in their absence.

   3. The Appellants met the requirements of the scheme under which they had
      applied, with the exception of that relating to finance. In  order  to
      succeed in the application, the Appellants needed to  show  that  they
      had available to them �1,333 in personal savings (�800 for  the  first
      Appellant and �533 for his wife as dependant)  for  the  three  months
      before their application on 9 June 2009. The application was supported
      by statements from a Barclays Bank current account, but on a number of
      occasions during the period from 8 March to 8 June, the  balance  fell
      below - sometimes well below - the required sum.

   4. At the hearing before  the  Immigration  Judge,  the  first  Appellant
      submitted further evidence. It consisted  of  statements  of  a  joint
      account held at Barclays Bank, the account  holders  being  the  first
      Appellant and Mr Muhammad Kambul Hasan, at the Appellants' address  in
      Walton-on-Thames. The first Appellant said that Mr Hasan is  a  friend
      of his, and they used to live in the same house.

   5. Some of the statements were not originals  but  certified  duplicates.
      The first Appellant said that he had submitted this evidence with  his
      application and it had not been returned to him. Whether or  not  that
      is so, evidence produced at the hearing of an appeal which, if it  had
      been produced with the application would have allowed the  application
      to succeed, is admissible in an in-country appeal under the provisions
      of s. 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,  as
      explained in NA and Others (Tier 1 post-study  work  -  funds)  [2009]
      UKAIT 00025.

   6. As the Immigration Judge found, the joint account had over  �1,333  in
      it on every one of the requisite days forming the  three-month  period
      before the Appellants made their application.

   7. The Immigration Judge reasoned that the joint account

         "cannot be included in these calculations as  it  is  quite  simply
         impossible to know what funds in that joint account were personally
         available at any given time to the main appellant and his wife that
         Mr Hasan did not also have a call on. Moreover, the spouse  of  the
         main  appellant  has  her  own  responsibility  in  her  individual
         application of showing that she has  the  minimum  level  of  funds
         required for a dependant, but she does  not  figure  in  the  joint
         account with Mr Hasan. Whilst paragraph 319C  (g)  and  Appendix  E
         (ea) (i) (ii) states that the funds in question must  be  available
         to the dependant applicant or to her Tier 1 Migrant partner,  which
         obviously allows separate accounts to be used in that  context;  as
         far as joint accounts are  concerned  the  PBS  (Dependant)  Policy
         Guidance states at paragraph 77 - 'If the applicant wishes to  rely
         on a joint account as evidence of available funds, he/she, the main
         applicant, or (for children) his/her other parent  who  is  legally
         present in the United Kingdom, must be named on the  account  along
         with one or more other named individual(s)'. This could, it has  to
         be said, be loosely interpreted as allowing in a joint account held
         by the dependant spouse or main applicant with another  person  who
         is a complete stranger to the application at issue, but  this  then
         comes back to the initial problem of it being impossible to  assess
         in such a context what funds are at any particular moment  in  time
         personally available to the other account holder who is not  making
         the application. I take it as implicit to the  overall  context  of
         paragraph 77 of the Guidance that the other one or more individuals
         who are also named as joint account holders must have an  important
         interest turning upon the application, as to  make  it  unthinkable
         that they could or would dispute the minimum  sum  as  having  been
         consistently available over a three months period to the person  or
         persons actually making that application. It  cannot  be  seen  how
         such an assumption could be made about a third party  and  stranger
         whose personal financial circumstances cannot fall to  be  assessed
         in the application."

   8. Mr Deller told us that provisions relating to joint accounts had  been
      accidentally omitted from the version of the  Guidance  applicable  to
      the present application, but he agreed with our observation that, when
      provisions as to joint accounts had been  included  in  the  Guidance,
      they appeared to  add  nothing  to  the  requirements  for  individual
      accounts. Mr Deller told us that  he  did  not  seek  to  support  the
      Immigration Judge's determination.

   9. We do not think that the Immigration Judge was right to say  that  the
      second Appellant's ability to meet the maintenance requirements was to
      be regarded as in some way independent. There is  no  doubt  that  the
      maintenance requirements of the two Appellants can properly be met  by
      showing that together they have done what the Rules and  the  Guidance
      require. The Guidance indicates  with  clarity  the  circumstances  in
      which the Secretary of State will regard possession of  the  requisite
      funds as established for the purposes of the Rules. Where the evidence
      is in the form of bank statements, the requirements  are  set  out  in
      paragraphs 93-96 of the relevant Guidance:

         "93. The evidence to support personal savings for  at  least  three
         months must be original, on the  official  letter-headed  paper  or
         stationery of the organisation and have the official stamp of  that
         organisation. It must have been issued by an authorised official of
         that organisation.

         94. Evidence must be in the form of cash funds. Other  accounts  or
         financial instruments such as shares,  bonds,  pension  funds  etc,
         regardless of notice period are not acceptable.

         95. The evidence of maintenance must be of cash funds in  the  bank
         (this includes savings accounts  and  current  accounts  even  when
         notice must be given), loan or  official  financial  or  government
         sponsorship available to the applicant. Other accounts or financial
         instruments such as shares, bonds, pension funds etc, regardless of
         notice period, are not acceptable.

         96. Only the following specified  documents  will  be  accepted  as
         evidence of this requirement:

           i)    Personal bank or building society statements covering  the
              three consecutive months.

         The most recent statement must be dated no more than  one  calendar
         month before the date of application.

         The personal bank or building  society  statements  should  clearly
         show:

         . the applicant's name;

         . the account number;

         . the date of the statement;

         . the financial institution's name and logo;

         . transactions covering the three month period;

         . that there are enough funds present in the account  (the  balance
         must always be at least �2,800 or �800, as appropriate).

         ..."

  10. Provided the money is in the account, it does not appear to matter who
      it belongs to. It may, for example, have been borrowed simply for  the
      purpose of having bank statements  meeting  the  requirements  of  the
      Guidance. The Immigration Judge's comments are obviously sensible. His
      mistake was to apply common sense to the interpretation of the points-
      based scheme. There is no perceptible rationale behind the  conclusion
      that the possession of �800 (and not a penny less)  for  three  months
      (and not a day less) is showing that an application  is  granted,  the
      applicant will be satisfactorily maintained for what  may  be  a  very
      long period in the future. The rules are simply hoops which have to be
      jumped through.

  11. Whoever it was that was properly to be regarded as the  owner  of  the
      money in the joint account, that account clearly met the  requirements
      of the Guidance: the first Appellant's name appeared on the statement.
      If, as the first Appellant asserted  to  the  Immigration  Judge,  the
      joint  account  statements  were  sent  with  the  applications,   the
      applications should have been  allowed.  In  any  event,  the  appeals
      should have been allowed. The Immigration Judge erred in  law  in  his
      approach to the joint account statements. We re-make the decision  and
      allow the Appellants' appeals.
