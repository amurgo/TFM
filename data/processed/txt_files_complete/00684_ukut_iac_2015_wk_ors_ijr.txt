   Representation:


   No appearance by the 1st Applicant.
   Mr G Davidson, instructed by Adam Bernard Solicitors, appeared on  behalf
   of the 2nd Applicant.
   Mr Swain, instructed by Eagle Solicitors, appeared on behalf of  the  3rd
   Applicant.
   Mr M Biggs, instructed by Mayfair Solicitors, appeared on behalf  of  the
   4th and 5th Applicant.
   Mr Pennington-Benton,  instructed  by  Farani  Javid  Taylor  Solicitors,
   appeared on behalf of the 6th Applicant.
   Mr Z Malik and Mr N Ahmed, instructed  by  BLC  Solicitors,  appeared  on
   behalf of the 7th Applicant.


   Mr W Hansen, instructed by the Government Legal  Department  appeared  on
   behalf of the Respondent.


   1. The Tribunal  has  jurisdiction  to  make  a  Common  Costs  Order  in
      appropriate cases.


   2. That jurisdiction will, however, be exercised only  on  the  basis  of
      establishing facts demonstrating the total amount of costs in question
      and the number of cases to which that total is attributable.


   3. If ETS cases are pursued to an oral  hearing  at  which  there  is  no
      prospect of success, the  Tribunal  will  consider  whether  the  case
      should be treated as an exception to the Mount Cook principles.


                          JUDGMENT ON COMMON COSTS

   1.  The  "ETS  cases"  arise  from  decisions  refusing  to  extend,   or
      effectively terminating, a  large  number  of  individuals'  leave  to
      remain in the United Kingdom.   Following a broadcast investigation by
      the television programme "Panorama" and internal review by Educational
      Testing Services itself, the conclusion was reached that many  English
      language certificates issued by ETS had been obtained in a  fraudulent
      manner, because thousands of tests had  been  undertaken  not  by  the
      person named on the certificate but by somebody else.  The  effect  of
      this discovery, and the Secretary of  State's  action  on  it,  varied
      between individuals.  Some had an in-country right of  appeal  against
      the decision about their leave; others had or have a right  of  appeal
      exercisable  only  from  outside  the  United  Kingdom.   Efforts   by
      substantial numbers of those in the latter class to maintain  judicial
      review proceedings have been met by the Secretary of State's  argument
      that permission  should  be  refused  because  there  is  an  adequate
      alternative  remedy  in  the  form  of  the   out-of-country   appeal,
      prescribed by Parliament in their  case.   The  Secretary  of  State's
      argument to that effect has been accepted; and it is clear  that,  for
      those who have an out-of-country right of appeal, judicial review will
      not lie save in a small  minority  of  cases  that  are  in  some  way
      exceptional.  I do  not  need  to  give  any  more  detail  about  the
      background, which is set out in detail in judgments by Beatson LJ in R
      (Mehmood and Ali) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ  744  and  R  (Sood)  v  SSHD
      [2015] EWCA Civ 831.


   2. The claims for judicial review fall for determination by this Tribunal
      in those cases covered by the Lord  Chief  Justice's  direction  under
      s.18(6) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act  2007,  and
      otherwise by the High Court.  Many of the claims were stayed  awaiting
      the judgments of the Court of Appeal to which I have  referred.   When
      those judgments were both available, the Tribunal's  staff  began,  on
      judicial authority, a process of writing to the  individual  claimants
      inviting them to say  whether,  in  the  light  of  the  authoritative
      statements of the law now available, they wished to proceed with their
      claim and, if they did,  requiring  them  to  submit  amended  grounds
      within a specified timescale, failing which their  applications  would
      be automatically struck out.  Undaunted by  the  weight  of  authority
      apparently against them, some hundreds of  applicants  have  submitted
      amended grounds and a sample group has been listed for hearing  before
      the President and myself.  The substantive hearing of those cases  was
      on 2 and 5 October, and judgments will follow in due course.


   3. A subsidiary matter, raised by the Secretary of State as part  of  the
      proceedings on 2 October, was an issue as to costs.   That  issue  was
      heard and dealt with by myself sitting alone.  I  gave  a  short  oral
      decision at the conclusion of the hearing.  This judgment  constitutes
      the full written reasons.


   4. The issues were presented by Mr Hansen in  his  skeleton  argument  on
      behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State,  on  which  he  also  made  oral
      submissions.  His submissions were  predicated  on  the  Secretary  of
      State's success in one or more of the individual cases heard on 2  and
      5 October; but they are of general application and it  is  appropriate
      to reach a general conclusion about them.    The  Secretary  of  State
      applies for an award of costs as common costs.  She seeks, as  against
      each unsuccessful applicant for judicial review,  an  order  that,  in
      addition to paying the defendant's  costs  of  the  Acknowledgment  of
      Service attributable to that particular case, each pay an  apportioned
      part of a larger sum.  That sum is the total amount of Counsel's costs
      incurred by the Secretary of State in taking advice on the  ETS  cases
      as a whole, so enabling her to formulate  a  common  response  to  the
      large number of individual claims.  The Secretary  of  State  proposes
      the calculation of the common costs on the following basis.   She  has
      spent �29,745.80 on Counsel's fees.  The "total number of ETS  claims"
      is 2,539.  She therefore  seeks  an  additional  �11.72  against  each
      claimant, that being the former sum divided by the latter.  The  claim
      is made on the basis that that calculation provides a fair attribution
      of the total cost to each individual applicant.


   5. Mr Hansen referred me briefly to the power of the  Upper  Tribunal  in
      relation to costs, deriving primarily from s.29 of the 2007 Act,  and,
      perhaps, to an extent augmented or supplemented by the powers in s.25.
       He reminded me that an order for common costs may be made in relation
      to individual claims that  have  not  been  consolidated  (Bairstow  v
      Queens Moat Houses plc [Nelson J,  14  April  2000]).   He  cited  the
      observation of Smith LJ in Russell Young & Co v Kevin Brown  &  Others
      [2007] EWCA Civ 43 at 31:


           "There is  nothing  fundamentally  different  or  special  about
           generic costs; they are simply costs that have been  shared  for
           the sensible purpose of keeping the costs of each claim down.  I
           could see no merit in the  suggestion  that  some  special  rule
           applies to the generic element of a bill of costs."


   6. Mr Hansen also referred me to the discussion of the calculation of the
      generic costs by Jay J in Haynes v Department for Business  Innovation
      and Skills [2014] EWHC 643.


   7. In my judgment, there is no serious room for doubt that  the  Tribunal
      has jurisdiction to make an  award  of  generic  or  common  costs  in
      appropriate cases.  What precisely might be the appropriate  cases  is
      rather more difficult to determine.  It is well-known that immigration
      litigation may feature groups of large numbers of cases which  may  be
      factually similar and which may justify legally  identical  responses.
      None of the cases particularly cited to me was of very  much  help  in
      determining whether a common costs order is appropriate  when,  as  in
      the present cases, a large number of claimants, not for the most  part
      acting together, bring claims against a single defendant over a period
      of time, and that defendant, over that period, incurs costs in taking,
      and then refining, a general line of defence in the light of both  the
      increasing number of cases and the developing jurisprudence as some of
      them come to Court.  In Young v Brown the order sought was  in  favour
      of successful claimants with cases more or  less  identical  on  their
      facts, and prepared together, against a single defendant.  In Haynes v
      Department of Business, the claimant had prepared ten  claims  against
      possible defendants.  The claim against one defendant was settled  for
      about a tenth of the total sum sought, and the other nine claims  were
      not served.  The question was the extent of the costs liability of the
      single defendant and the basis of its calculation.  Bairstow v  Queens
      Moat did concern separate  unsuccessful  claimants  against  a  single
      defendant, but part of the expressed reason that the  judge  gave  for
      considering that a common costs order was appropriate was that each of
      the claimants had known that by pursuing his  unmeritorious  claim  he
      was assisting the other claimants in doing the same thing.


   8. If I may put it in this way, the elements  of  appropriate  commonalty
      may differ between claimants and defendants.  Accepting as of course I
      do that there may need to be no formal link between  individual  cases
      in order to make  a  common  costs  order  appropriate  or  available,
      nevertheless the basis of  approximate  arithmetical  calculation,  as
      endorsed in Haynes v Department of Business and urged upon me  in  the
      present case, has to be a factual starting point indicating  that  the
      total sum in question is one that should be  shared.   It  was,  after
      all, a similar issue which led to Jay J's allowing the appeal in  that
      case.  The Master had failed properly  to  distinguish  between  those
      costs which the claimant was entitled to recover in full  against  the
      single  defendant,  and  those  which  were  properly  to  be  shared.
      Although  the  precise  issue,  which  was  the  distinction   between
      "specific" and "non-specific"  costs,  is  not  precisely  that  which
      arises in the present cases, the judgment, which reviews a  number  of
      other cases, makes it clear that considerations of this sort cannot be
      properly be ignored.


   9. I should add that none of the cases  to  which  I  had  been  referred
      sounded in public law: (Haynes v Department of Business was a  private
      law claim); and in none of them does there appear  to  have  been  any
      real doubt about the amount available in principle  for  division,  or
      the number of parties or potential parties amongst which it  might  be
      divided.


  10. The present cases are very different; and although I  appreciate  that
      in the limited time available  to  Mr  Hansen  he  could  not  make  a
      complete survey of the law and practice in relation to  common  costs,
      nevertheless the authorities he cited are the ones which he  chose  to
      support his application.  For  the  purposes  of  proceedings  in  the
      Tribunal I am content to accept in principle what was said in argument
      before Nelson J in Bairstow v Queens Moat at [20] that the usual order
      is that common  costs  are  the  responsibility  of  all  unsuccessful
      parties.  That principle must, however, be subject to  enquiry  as  to
      which costs are common and which parties are to  be  regarded  as  the
      unsuccessful parties in  the  litigation  in  question,  and  must  be
      subject also to any specific extraneous limitation on  the  amount  of
      costs awarded.


  11. I have reached the conclusion that Mr  Hansen's  application  must  be
      refused.  There are three  primary  reasons,  which  interlink  almost
      inextricably.  They are each a consequence of  the  history  of  these
      cases, where over a relatively short but by no means negligible period
      of time,  the  number  of  claimants  and  applicants  increased,  the
      jurisprudence developed, and the costs were incurred.


  12. Mr Hansen submits that dividing the total cost incurred  in  Counsel's
      fees by the total number of ETS cases is an appropriate way to  divide
      the common costs amongst the unsuccessful parties.   Before looking at
      the calculation in any detail, I must refer to the most  important  of
      the relevant extraneous limitations to which I referred  above.   That
      is the principle normally cited as the Mount Cook [2003] EWCA Civ 1346
      principle, that a defendant or respondent  successfully  defending  an
      application for permission for judicial review is normally entitled to
      the costs attributable to considering whether to defend the claim, and
      entering an Acknowledgment of Service, but not, in the usual case,  to
      any more than that.  In the group of cases  under  consideration,  the
      Secretary of State's position is that permission  should  be  refused;
      and indeed the vast majority of cases before the  Tribunal,  including
      all but one of  those  being  considered  at  this  hearing,  await  a
      decision on the application for permission, either on paper  or  as  a
      result of renewing the application to an oral hearing.  As is  clearly
      accepted  by  Mr  Hansen  in  these  circumstances,   therefore,   the
      defendant's claimable common costs will be only those which  could  be
      attributable to the Acknowledgement of Service.


  13. In looking at the proposed calculation, it is  perhaps  convenient  to
      start with the total cost of Counsel's fees, which is proposed as  the
      numerator (top line) of the fraction.  Here at once Mr  Hansen  is  in
      difficulties.  For the costs to be in any sense  common,  it  must  be
      possible to attribute them to all the cases amongst which they are  to
      be divided.  Mount Cook means, therefore, that the Acknowledgement  of
      Service in each of the cases must have post-dated the incurring of the
      whole of that  sum,  because  any  work  done  by  Counsel  after  the
      presentation of the Acknowledgement of Service in  a  particular  case
      could not be attributable to that case.  In response to a  question  I
      asked at the hearing, a certain amount of research was done  by  those
      behind Mr Hanson, and it appears that in none of  the  cases  selected
      for this hearing could it be said that  the  whole  of  the  costs  of
      �29,745.80 had been incurred before  the  relevant  Acknowledgment  of
      Service.   It follows that although there may be costs common  to  ETS
      cases or some group of them, it cannot be said that the sum claimed is
      common to a group of  cases  of  which  these  cases  form  part.   In
      general, it does not look as though the Secretary of State is able  to
      identify any appropriate numerator for a specified denominator.


  14. Turning then to the denominator (bottom line) of the fraction, this is
      described, as noted above, as the "total number of ETS claims".  I  do
      not know exactly what that means: Mr Hansen did not say, and I omitted
      to ask.  It is, I think, almost double the number of  judicial  review
      claims commenced in the Tribunal.  It looks as though the figure  must
      include judicial review claims commenced in the High  Court.   It  may
      also include cases in which an in-country right  of  appeal  has  been
      exercised: it may even be the total number of the Secretary of State's
      decisions on what may broadly be called ETS grounds.  I assume in  the
      Secretary of State's favour for present purposes that  the  number  is
      limited  to  the  total  number  of   judicial   review   claims   and
      applications.


  15. The first problem might be said to be that that is not necessarily the
      number of "unsuccessful parties",  because  some  claims  may  not  be
      pursued, and some   claimants may succeed in their claim.  The success
      of some claimants does  not,  however,  make  any  difference  to  the
      calculation of the amount of the common  costs  attributable  to  each
      claim; and Haynes v Department of Business shows that the  process  of
      division  may  be  appropriate  even  if  not  all  the  divisors  are
      litigants.


  16. More important, however, is again the question of commonalty.  Bearing
      in mind the terms of the Lord Chief Justice's direction, it is in  the
      highest degree likely that those claims  brought  in  the  High  Court
      rather than in the Tribunal were so brought  because  they  include  a
      challenge to a  claimant's  detention.   Certainly  it  is  within  my
      knowledge  that  a  considerable  number  of  those  affected  by  ETS
      decisions have been detained with a view to their removal.   No  doubt
      common advice has been given in respect of  them;  but  it  is  advice
      which does not apply at all to those claimants who bring  their  cases
      in the Tribunal and do not challenge detention.  So here  again  there
      must be considerable doubt about what the appropriate  figure  is.   A
      calculation based on dividing one unknown figure  by  another  unknown
      figure is not a sound basis for the award of costs.


  17. The third difficulty is the application of  the  indemnity  principle,
      recently examined by this Tribunal in R (Bakhtiyar) v SSHD [2015] UKUT
      00519 (IAC).  As Mr  Biggs  pointed  out  on  behalf  of  two  of  the
      applicants in the  present  hearing,  it  is  not  clear  whether  the
      Secretary of State has yet obtained substantive costs in  any  of  the
      cases she has successfully defended.  It is true that  both  Sood  and
      Ali were cases where the refusal of permission was upheld by the Court
      of Appeal, and Mehmood, though a substantive hearing, was not  an  ETS
      case.  Nevertheless, general costs (not limited to �11.72) in relation
      to the defence of ETS  cases  may  have  been  awarded  in  these  and
      possibly in other cases.  The Secretary of State's present application
      could only be maintained on the basis  that  she  has  not,  to  date,
      recovered any of the costs attributable to Counsel's advice towards  a
      common defence in ETS cases.


  18. Further, Mr Hansen indicated during the course  of  the  hearing  that
      part of the effect of Counsel's advice in these cases  was  that  case
      workers had been provided with standard forms for completion in  order
      to produce an Acknowledgement of Service.  There is nothing wrong with
      that in principle, but it must reduce the time that needs to be  spent
      in drafting an Acknowledgment of Service.   It  may  be  that  if  the
      general advice  is  to  be  claimed  and  paid  for  separately,  more
      attention would need to  be  given  to  the  claim  of  time  for  the
      Acknowledgement of Service which, again in my own experience, does not
      seem to have noticeably reduced despite the production and  presumably
      refinement  of  the  templates.   A  claim  for  the  costs  for   the
      Acknowledgement of Service can  properly  include  a  contribution  to
      general advice which was relevant to it.   The  cost  of  such  advice
      comes, broadly speaking, under the same head as the assistance and the
      price of advisory lawyers: see Bakhtiyar at [36].  It might  therefore
      be assumed that the appropriate cost had already been included in  the
      claim for the costs of the Acknowledgment of Service: it does not very
      obviously constitute a justifiable addition to them.


  19.  Mr Hansen's application is, in substance,  to  amend  the  claim  for
      costs in each  of  the  cases  currently  before  the  Tribunal  (and,
      presumably, an unspecified and as yet  unidentified  number  of  other
      claims) by adding �11.72 to each.  The reason for the late application
      is presumably that the Secretary of State did not  previously  realise
      that these costs, said to be nearly �30,000, could be claimed; and the
      amount is obtained by dividing one figure by another, neither of which
      are shown to be the correct figure.  When it  is  expressed  in  those
      terms, it is of course clear that Mr Hansen's application  must  fail.
      An alternative would,  as  the  parties  before  me  recognise,  be  a
      detailed  assessment  of  the  costs.   That   I   would   regard   as
      inappropriate.  First, the  costs  of  detailed  assessment  would  be
      wholly disproportionate  to  the  amount  in  dispute,  which,  in  an
      individual case, is �11.72.   Secondly,  detailed  assessment  of  the
      common costs would not be possible without a detailed examination  not
      limited to the cases  in  which  such  a  claim  was  made,  but  also
      encompassing all the cases said to justify the  figure  given  as  the
      denominator, and all the cases said to justify the figure given as the
      numerator, in each case by reference to the time that particular costs
      were incurred. I hesitate to describe the task as impossible,  but  it
      would certainly be very difficult and time-consuming.


  20. So far as the present cases are concerned, therefore,  costs  will  be
      awarded on a Mount Cook basis in  those  permission  applications  (if
      any) in which the Secretary of State is successful  in  resisting  the
      application.  I anticipate that there will be an application  for  the
      costs  to  be  summarily  assessed  on  the  basis  set  out  in   the
      Acknowledgement of Service.  Such a claim is likely to be regarded  as
      reasonable if it is for  a  reasonable  time  at  a  reasonable  rate.
      Preparation costs can properly be claimed as long as they are properly
      attributable to the  preparation  of  an  Acknowledgement  of  Service
      resisting permission, rather than to a complete defence of the  claim.
      If authority for that proposition is needed, it can be  readily  found
      in the judgment of Sir Anthony Clarke MR in  Davey  v  Aylesbury  Vale
      District Council [2007] EWCA Civ 1166 at [32]-[33].


  21. The cases in which   Mr Hansen's application is specifically made  are
      sample cases.  Looking at the ETS  claims  as  a  whole,  the  binding
      authority of the Court of Appeal is applicable to the  great  majority
      of the grounds that have been advanced.  Further issues may arise from
      time to time, and the present cases give an opportunity for  a  newly-
      raised substantive issue to be  decided  authoritatively  at  Tribunal
      level.  In Mount Cook itself at [76] Auld LJ set out at  sub-paragraph
      (5) the exceptions to the restriction on awarding costs to a defendant
      at this stage of judicial review proceedings.  Two of  the  exceptions
      are:


            "(a) the hopelessness of the claim;
             (b) the persistence in it by the  claimant  after  having  been
               alerted  to  facts  and/or  of  the  law  demonstrating  its
               hopelessness"

  22. Applicants to the Tribunal may expect those exceptions to  be  applied
      where cases that are hopeless on their merits are renewed to  an  oral
      permission hearing.
