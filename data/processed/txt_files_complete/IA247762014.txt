For the Appellant:     Mr S J Joseph, Counsel instructed by Chambers of Sel

For the Respondent:    Ms S Vijayharan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Sri Lanka, date  of  birth  7  June  1948,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision,  dated  13  June  2013,  to
    refuse an application for a residence card made on 12 May 2014.
2.   The decision of 11 June 2014 in the  event  came  down  solely  to  the
    issue of appropriate evidence of dependency between the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor, Mr Roy Mendis.

3.   The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Fox who, on 21  August
    2014, dismissed the appeal under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations)  with  reference  to  the
    fact that the Appellant had failed to discharge  the  burden  of  proof
    upon a balance of probabilities of the claimed dependency and also with
    reference to the claimed domestic arrangements  between  the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor.

4.   The judge said at paragraphs 7 and 8 of the determination:

         "7.  The Appellant has failed  to  satisfy  the  burden  upon  her.
             There appears to be no dispute that the Appellant falls within
             the  qualifying  relationship  of  Regulation  7  of  the  EEA
             Regulations.  The issue is of the claimed dependency  and  the
             place of residence."


         8.   The Appellant claims the Respondent issued a residence card to
             her husband on the same evidence.  It would be helpful to have
             sight of the application form and details of the circumstances
             surrounding the husband's application  for  a  residence  card
             along with the proof of its issuance.   It  is  reasonable  to
             expect that this evidence is available to the  Appellant  with
             relative ease. "


    The judge then went on to find that those relevant matters had not been
    established.


5.   The judge set out the evidence before  him  in  the  following  way  at
    paragraph 5:

         "5.  "There is no evidence that the Respondent filed  or  served  a
             formal bundle.


         6.   The Appellant did  not  file  or  serve  a  formal  bundle  of
             evidence.  She enclosed various documents with the  notice  of
             appeal which comprises remittance advices for the  benefit  of
             the Appellant and her husband."


6.   It is right  to  note  that  the  judge's  summary  of  the  additional
    documents provided by the Appellant  with  the  grounds  of  appeal  is
    incomplete and fails to acknowledge the information provided concerning
    the dependency between the Appellant and her Sponsor and  the  intended
    arrangements for them.

7.   It is unarguable that the judge did not have the  Respondent's  bundle.
    Within the case file there is evidence of the bundle being sent under a
    letter of 13 August 2014 to Arnhem House Support  Centre  who  received
    the same on 15 August and the bundle was then sent to Hatton  Cross  of
    which the hearing at Richmond, part of the same hearing centre,  on  or
    about 18 August 2014.  Ultimately the  bundle  was  then  sent  off  to
    storage at Castle Park on 22 August  2014  from  which  the  reasonable
    inference may be drawn that as a fact it never got  to  the  judge  and
    unfortunately was never seen by him with the relevant  evidence  within
    it  which  included  the  EEA2  residence  card  application  and  some
    supporting documents.  It is notable that in the  EEA  application  the
    documents recorded as submitted  include  evidence  of  dependency  and
    documentation  checklist  which  includes  bank  statements,  invoices,
    receipts, domestic information concerning the Sponsor's  accommodation.
    It is clear that that material never got to the judge.

8.   In addition, accompanying the  appeal,  some  further  information  was
    repeated, namely evidence of remittances previously made  in  July  for
    the period 2012 to 2013 concerning remittances from R Mendis to Mr W  A
    R K Mendis in Sri Lanka and evidence from the  Sponsor  giving  further
    particulars of payments made.  The evidence postdates the date  of  the
    Respondent's decision but similarly  the  judge  in  dealing  with  the
    appeal and in particular, as I have quoted at paragraph 5 and 6 of  the
    determination, plainly did not take the documents into account  or  pay
    any regard to them  or  consider  them,  even  if  after  the  date  of
    decision, as being relevant back to the facts and matters in  being  at
    the date of the Respondent's decision.  Nor indeed did the  judge  take
    them into account in connection with his assessment of  the  merits  of
    the appeal.

9.   It is most unfortunate that this material had  not  been  presented  to
    the judge or was not taken into account by the judge for it is  plainly
    relevant to the merits of the issue of dependency and the  arrangements
    the Sponsor was putting in place to care for his mother bearing in mind
    his father had by that stage got the  necessary  permit  to  enter  and
    remain in the United Kingdom as the dependant of the Sponsor.

10.  There was in the remarks made by the Appellant addressing the judge  in
    the form IAFT1 other material which could have  had  two  consequences.
    First, in the judge considering whether this  was  now  an  appropriate
    case to proceed on the papers and whether or not to have the matter re-
    listed for an oral hearing.  Secondly,  whether  or  not  the  evidence
    properly taken into account supported the  conclusion  that  there  was
    dependency and that both  the  Appellant  and  her  husband  were  both
    unemployed, too old  to  work  and  were  supported  for  their  living
    expenses solely  by  the  Sponsor.   Accordingly  there  was  evidence,
    including the Appellant's grounds, to show that she was dependent on Mr
    R Mendis, the EEA Sponsor.

11.  In these circumstances, Mr Joseph submitted that there  was  illegality
    in the consideration of this matter by the judge because the judge  had
    proceeded without having a Respondent's bundle.  I do not  accept  that
    as a matter of law a  judge  must  have  the  Respondent's  bundle.  In
    certain circumstances ignorance of material facts may be  an  error  of
    law. In another case it may be possible to argue that there is an error
    of  law  on  that  basis  of  a  procedural  irregularity   that    led
    unfortunately to the omission of evidence.   I am satisfied that  there
    was a material procedural error of law by the judge  partly  compounded
    by the judge's ignorance of the Home office bundle  and  its  contents,
    failing  to  take  into  account  the  grounds  of   appeal   and   the
    representations being made which, taken  at  their  highest,  certainly
    give rise to the real concern that there was not a proper consideration
    of the appeal.

12.  As such I find  the  original  Tribunal  decision  cannot  stand.   The
    original Tribunal decision  will  have  to  be  re-made.   I  give  the
    following directions:

DIRECTIONS

1.   Re-list in the First-tier Tribunal but not before  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judges Fox, J P M Hollingworth or T Davey.

2.   Hearing time estimate - 1ï¿½ hours.

3.   No interpreter required.

4.   Witness statements and/or any  additional  documents  relevant  to  the
    date of decision to be submitted not less than  fourteen  working  days
    before the re-making of the appeal.  The witness statements to stand as
    the evidence-in-chief and if any expert or  other  evidence  is  to  be
    called, notice is to be given to the other party and  upon  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  All bundles other than  those  previously  referred  to
    should be provided not less  than  fourteen  days  before  the  further
    hearing.
