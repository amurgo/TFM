                       DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL

                        PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF
             THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellants have permission to appeal against the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing their appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision to refuse them a residence card as the extended family members
    of the principal applicant's brother, the brother-in-law of the  second
    appellants, who is said to be  exercising  EEA  Treaty  rights  in  the
    United  Kingdom.   The  application  was  made  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

 2. Mr Bramble accepted at the hearing that the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal was legally erroneous as to the test applicable  for  extended
    family members and that there was  no  alternative  but  to  remit  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  Ms Akinbolu concurred.

 3. The parties agree that this is a case where the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal must be set  aside,  and  that  no  written  reasons  are
    required.  The requirements of sub-paragraphs 40(3)(a) and 40(3)(b)  of
    the Rules are met.  I am satisfied that the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal can properly be set aside without a reasoned  decision  notice
    and that the parties have consented to that course of action.

 4. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, with  no
    findings of fact or credibility preserved. The appeal will now  proceed
    to the stage in which the First-tier Tribunal will remake the  decision
    to allow or dismiss the appeal on the basis described in the  grant  of
    permission.
