For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Parkes ('the judge'),  promulgated  on  28  October  2019,
         dismissing MA's appeal against the Secretary of  State's  decisions
         refusing his protection and human rights claim and deciding that he
         had ceased to qualify for refugee status. Both decisions  were  set
         out in a letter dated  11  October  2018,  though  the  latter  was
         recorded as having been determined on 4 April 2018.

Background

      2. MA is a national of Somalia born in April 1977. He entered  the  UK
         on 11 November 1994 with  his  mother  and  siblings  to  join  his
         father, who had Indefinite Leave to  Remain  ('ILR')  and  who  had
         resided in the UK for 31 years. On 12 December  1995,  MA's  mother
         was recognised as a refugee and MA was recognised as a refugee. The
         family members were each granted ILR.

      3. At the time of MA's entry to the UK, it was noted that  his  family
         were from Burao, a city in Somaliland. In  his  application  for  a
         Home Office travel document  in  1996,  MA's  place  of  birth  was
         recorded as  Burao.  When  he  applied  for  a  replacement  travel
         document in 2012, the Secretary of  State  recorded  his  place  of
         birth as Mogadishu on  his  biometric  residence  card  and  travel
         document.

      4. On 24 March  2017,  MA  was  convicted  of  fraudulently  obtaining
         �72,000 over a six-year period. On 3  April  2017,  he  received  a
         sentence of 20 months' imprisonment.  On  19  April  2017,  he  was
         served with a notice of decision to deport and, on 6 December 2017,
         a notice of intention to revoke his refugee status.  On  7  October
         2018, a deportation order was made against MA and, on  11  October,
         the Secretary of State decided to refuse his protection  and  human
         rights claims, and  recorded  that  his  refugee  status  had  been
         revoked pursuant to Article 1C(5) of the  Refugee  Convention  (the
         'cessation' clauses), which is given  effect  in  domestic  law  by
         paragraphs 338A and 339A(v) of the immigration rules.

      5. MA appealed the Secretary of State's  decision  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal under s. 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
         2002 (the 2002 Act).

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      6. At [16], the judge summarised the appellant's protection claim. The
         judge noted the appellant's claim that he was born  and  raised  in
         Mogadishu, not in Burao. The appellant's fear was said to be  based
         on his clan membership and  the  circumstances  he  would  face  in
         Mogadishu on his return in light of current country  guidance.  The
         appellant  additionally  relied  on  Article  8   to   resist   his
         deportation. The judge failed to record MA's principal  claim  that
         he feared being targeted by Al-Shabab because he was  a  singer  in
         the Somali community. This claim appeared both in his statement (at
         paragraph 90) and in the skeleton argument Ms Loughran had prepared
         on his behalf  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing.  Whilst  MA
         accepted that Al-Shabab were no longer in control of Mogadishu, she
         submitted that they still had a presence in the city and were  able
         to carry out attacks.

      7. At [18] to [21], the judge summarised the oral evidence from MA and
         a supporting witness. MA claimed that his friends would  be  unable
         to assist him now that he was out of prison and had a job and  that
         some were too busy to attend the  hearing.  The  witness  indicated
         that the appellant's friends had sent him between  �30  and  �50  a
         month when he was in prison.  The  witness  himself  had  financial
         problems  and  would  not  be  able  to  continue  to  support  the
         appellant.

      8. In the section of the decision headed 'Discussion and Findings' the
         judge considered the competing claims relating to  the  appellant's
         home area in Somalia. He stated:

             "In my view this is not the central point  that  it  has  been
             suggested. The fact is that the Appellant will be returned  to
             Mogadishu which is where he says  he  is  from.  There  is  no
             obvious way that he could get from there to Somaliland and  so
             this decision focuses on the circumstances there. In doing  so
             I have had regard to the country guidance case of MOJ and  the
             current CPIN."

      9. The judge then referred to both MOJ &  Ors  (Return  to  Mogadishu)
         Somalia  CG  [2014]  UKUT  00442  (IAC)  and  the  Country   Policy
         Information  Note  (CPIN)  and  concluded  that  the  situation  in
         Mogadishu had not changed substantively since MOJ was  promulgated.
         At [26], the judge summarised the CPIN at �2.4.10,  which  repeated
         paragraph 408 of  MOJ.  This  paragraph  related  to  returnees  to
         Mogadishu. The Upper Tribunal found that only those with no clan or
         family support who were not  be  in  receipt  of  remittances  from
         abroad and who had  no  real  prospect  of  securing  access  to  a
         livelihood  on  return  would  face  the  prospect  of  living   in
         circumstances  falling  below  that   which   was   acceptable   in
         humanitarian protection terms. The judge noted  that  MA's  partner
         and children lived in the UK, as did his mother and  siblings,  and
         that he received support from friends of Somali origin.

     10. The judge noted that the appellant had a circle of friends  in  the
         UK from whom he received support and that he obtained a  number  of
         certificates whilst in prison, covering IT  skills,  security  work
         and employment related themes, which were in addition to  his  work
         experience in the UK. At [28], the judge found it difficult to  see
         how the appellant would not have the  ability  to  obtain  work  in
         Mogadishu on return.

     11. At [29] and [30] the judge stated:

             "With regard to the support that the Appellant could receive I
             do not believe that the Appellant would not be in  receipt  of
             financial remittances from the UK. If his friends were able to
             assist when he was in prison there is  no  obvious  change  in
             circumstances that would prevent further support.

             There is no evidence from the Appellant's family and I note he
             has a number of siblings. I do not believe that  he  would  be
             totally without support from that quarter either.  The  number
             of friends and family who could support the Appellant is quite
             extensive and the amount of contribution from them  would  not
             need to be large to provide him with the assistance required."



     12. At [32], the judge found that  the  evidence  before  him  did  not
         justify a departure from MOJ and did not  show  that  MA  would  be
         unable to access work in Mogadishu. The judge  rejected  the  claim
         that MA's circumstances would be such as to breach Article  3.  The
         judge stated:

             "I find that the  Appellant  can  reasonably  be  expected  to
             relocate to Mogadishu and that it would not  be  unduly  harsh
             for him to do so."

     13. The judge  then  considered  MA's  family  relationships  with  his
         children but concluded that his deportation would  not  breach  the
         family life element of Article 8. Based on his findings relating to
         the international  protection  aspect  of  MA's  claim,  the  judge
         concluded that he would not face any very significant obstacles  to
         his integration in Somalia. At [37], the judge commented that  MA's
         family life was limited and that there was no evidence  to  suggest
         that he had particularly strong bonds with any of his  siblings  or
         his mother.

     14. The appeal was dismissed on all grounds.

The challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision and the 'error  of  law'
hearing

     15. The first ground of appeal contends that the judge failed  to  make
         any findings in respect of MA's claimed  fear  of  Al-Shabab  as  a
         singer in the Somali community. The second ground contends that the
         failed to determine the appellant's home area. This was relevant as
         it determined whether he would be treated as someone  returning  to
         Mogadishu or someone who was internally relocating to the city. The
         judge conflated the approach identified in MOJ to the  position  of
         returnees (considered at [407] and  [408])  with  the  approach  to
         those internally relocating to Mogadishu (considered at [425]). The
         third ground contends that the judge failed to undertake a  careful
         assessment of all relevant considerations identified in [407(h)] of
         MOJ. The judge failed to consider  how  MA's  lack  of  links  with
         Mogadishu would impact on his ability to find work  and  failed  to
         consider whether the fact that  his  qualifications  were  obtained
         whilst in prison and the fact of his  criminal  record  would  also
         impact on his ability to find work. The judge  failed  to  consider
         MA's  actual  answers  during   the   hearing   relating   to   the
         circumstances in which  he  was  financially  supported  whilst  in
         prison, and he was not entitled, on the  evidence  before  him,  to
         find that MA's family would support him. The judge also  failed  to
         consider  the  impact  of  drought  when  determining  whether  the
         conditions in which the appellant would find himself in Mogadishu.

     16. Although the First-tier Tribunal judge who  granted  permission  to
         appeal commented on the materiality of some of the arguable errors,
         she did not restrict the grounds that could be argued.

     17. Ms Loughran relied on her grounds and a skeleton argument. She drew
         our attention to MA's statement,  in  which  he  claimed  that  his
         singing at Somali weddings and other events had been recorded. This
         evidence had not been challenged  during  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         hearing. Al-Shabab operated a strict interpretation of Islamic  law
         and anyone who did  not  adhere  to  their  ethos  may  risk  being
         targeted. Ms Loughran accepted there was no  evidence  as  to  MA's
         prominence within the Somali community, or that other  singers  had
         been targeted, but she submitted that  video  recordings  could  be
         easily shared electronically and that MA's claim that he  was  well
         enough known was not challenged. Ms Loughran reiterated that it was
         impossible to discern whether the judge was treating  Mogadishu  as
         MA's home area or a  place  of  internal  relocation,  and  if  the
         latter, he failed to apply the  approach  identified  in  MOJ.  The
         judge failed to consider  MA's  oral  explanation  as  to  why  his
         friends would be unable to remit funds to him in Mogadishu.

     18. Mr Avery relied upon the Secretary of  State's  skeleton  argument.
         Although it was accepted that the judge failed to engage with  MA's
         claimed fear of being targeted by al Shabab as a singer,  this  was
         not material. MA was silent on the frequency of his singing or  the
         nature of his audience and he did not claim that his singing was of
         a  political  nature.  The  appellant  relied  on  a  news  article
         concerning the shooting of the Mayor of Mogadishu by Al-Shabab, but
         this was markedly different. There was no evidence before the judge
         that singers had been targeted. Without further evidence, MA's fear
         from Al-Shabab was fanciful.

     19. The Secretary of State accepted that the judge should have  made  a
         finding on MA's place of birth, but contended that this  error  was
         not material as any error would only be to  the  detriment  of  the
         Secretary of State.  Whether  MA  was  returning  to  Mogadishu  or
         relocating there for the first time would necessarily be covered in
         a holistic  assessment  of  all  the  circumstances  such  as  that
         undertaken by the judge. On a fair reading  of  the  decision,  the
         judge did consider the issue of internal relocation  from  [24]  to
         [32]. The remainder of the grounds did not identify  any  error  of
         law. For example, there was no reference to  the  drought  in  MA's
         skeleton argument prepared for the First-tier Tribunal. If the MA's
         friends were prepared to support him financially  in  prison,  they
         were likely to do so again.

     20. We reserved our decision.

Discussion

     21. The Secretary of State accepts that the judge failed to engage with
         MA's claim that he risked being specifically targeted by  Al-Shabab
         because he sang at Somali weddings and other venues in the  UK.  Ms
         Loughran confirmed at the 'error of law' hearing that this was  the
         only basis  for  the  Refugee  Convention  claim  advanced  by  the
         appellant. It is therefore all the more surprising that this aspect
         of the claim was overlooked by the judge.

     22. In his witness statement, MA claimed he would be at particular risk
         from al-Shabab because  his  performances  were  recorded.  He  was
         concerned that religious groups would become aware of his  presence
         in Mogadishu through circulation of  the  recordings  and  that  he
         would be specifically targeted as Al-Shabab said  they  would  kill
         all singers.

     23. The Secretary of State contends that any mistake made by the  judge
         was immaterial because the appellant could not, on  any  reasonable
         view, have succeeded on the basis he  advanced.  The  Secretary  of
         State notes the absence of any details as to the frequency of  MA's
         performances or the nature of his audiences, and the absence of any
         evidence that the songs were of a political nature or  critical  of
         Al-Shabab. The respondent contends that it is simply fanciful  that
         Al-Shabab would become aware of MA's presence in Mogadishu and then
         target him.

     24. We do not consider that the error of  law  was  immaterial  in  the
         sense that the judge would inevitably have rejected this aspect  of
         the  claim.  MA's  evidence  relating  to  the  recording  of   his
         performances was not challenged by the respondent at the First-tier
         Tribunal hearing.  The  evidence  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         indicated that, although Al-Shabab was  no  longer  in  control  of
         Mogadishu, it did carry out targeted attacks. MA relied on one such
         attack, carried out on the mayor of Mogadishu on 24 July  2019.  MA
         accepts that the mayor's death was different from an  attack  on  a
         singer but  maintains  that  it  demonstrates  that  such  targeted
         attacks do occur. The CPIN relating to Al-Shabab, dated July  2017,
         indicated that  Al-Shabab  advocated  a  strict  interpretation  of
         Islamic law for  Somalia  and  was  against  western  influence  on
         Africa.  In  AMM  and  others   (conflict;   humanitarian   crisis;
         returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011]  UKUT  445  (IAC),  the  Tribunal
         considered the nature of the group and concluded that a person from
         an Al-Shabab area who could show that they did not genuinely adhere
         to Al-Shabab's ethos would have a good claim to Refugee  Convention
         protection. Although the appellant did not produce any evidence  of
         the recordings of his performances, we take judicial notice of  the
         relative ease with which  digital  recordings,  particularly  those
         made using mobile phones, can be shared and circulated.  Given  the
         unchallenged evidence that the appellant often sang at  events  and
         that his performances were recorded,  and  given  the  evidence  of
         continued targeted attacks in Mogadishu and the extreme  nature  of
         Al-Shabab, we cannot say that a judge, properly  directing  him  or
         herself on the facts and the law, would not be rationally  entitled
         to allow an asylum appeal on the basis advanced by the appellant.

     25. This error of law requires the First-tier Tribunal's decision to be
         set aside. We are additionally satisfied that the  judge  erred  in
         law in his assessment of the issue of remittances. In  her  grounds
         of appeal, Ms Loughran set out the appellant's oral evidence  based
         on her handwritten record of the proceedings. The accuracy  of  the
         extract has not been disputed. The appellant stated:

             "Everybody is busy  helping  their  own  family.  Even  today,
             people I asked to come to meet me and they haven't come.

             [...]

             When they are here I'm very close to him. Prison is near where
             they live. There [Somalia] I have nowhere to live,  no  money.
             How do they put effort in to pay me?

             [...]

             I don't think I will get assistance  from  anybody.  They  are
             busy covering their own businesses."

     26.  We accept Ms Loughran's submission that  there  is  a  potentially
         significant difference between the appellant's friends  giving  him
         money when he is in a nearby prison and transmitting money  to  him
         in Somalia. The judge, however, failed to consider the  explanation
         given by MA and, although he referred  to  the  witness's  evidence
         concerning his own finances when  summarising  the  oral  evidence,
         there was no engagement with this evidence in the judge's findings.



     27. Nor are we satisfied that the judge was entitled to  conclude  that
         MA would be financially supported by his family in  the  UK.  There
         was no evidence that the appellant's family members sent any  money
         to him when he was imprisoned, no family members attended the First-
         tier Tribunal hearing and, according to the  judge,  there  was  no
         evidence that MA had particularly strong  bonds  with  any  of  his
         siblings or his mother. The judge's finding was without  evidential
         foundation. These errors are material as access to remittances is a
         relevant factor when assessing whether the conditions in  which  MA
         would find himself in  Mogadishu  could  either  breach  Article  3
         (having full regard to Secretary of State for the Home Department v
         Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442 and SB  (refugee  revocation;  IDP  camps)
         Somalia [2019] UKUT 00358 (IAC)) or could entitle him to a grant of
         humanitarian protection.

     28. Given our findings it is not necessary to determine further whether
         the judge's failure to  identify  the  appellant's  home  area  was
         itself a material error. It was accepted by the respondent that the
         judge should have made a finding of fact on the  appellant's  place
         of birth.

Remittal to First-Tier Tribunal

     29. Under Part 3  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Practice
         Statement of the 18 June 2018 the case may be remitted to the First-
         tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

         (a)  the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
             First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for
             that party's case to be put to and considered  by  the  First-
             tier Tribunal; or

         (b)  the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
             necessary in order for the decision in the appeal  to  be  re-
             made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
             in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit the case to  the  First-
             tier Tribunal.

     30. We have determined that the judge failed to make  any  findings  in
         respect of the asylum claim advanced by the appellant or in respect
         of the appellant's home area, and that other findings made  by  the
         judge are unsafe. The appeal will be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal so that a new fact-finding exercise can be undertaken.



Notice of Decision

The making of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  involved  the  making  of
errors on points of law and is set aside.

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  decided  afresh
by a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Parkes.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  in

direction applies both to the appellant and to the  respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
