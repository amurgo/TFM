For the Appellant:     Ms G Loughran (Waterstone Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms Holmes (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of Ermira [K], a citizen of Albania born [~] 1990,
       against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of 31  October  2018,
       dismissing her appeal against the refusal of  her  asylum  claim  and
       human  rights  claims,  themselves  refused  by  a  decision  of  the
       Respondent of 7 February 2018.


    2. Taking as the starting point the summary of the claim  given  by  the
       First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant arrived in the UK by lorry  on  18
       December 2015 having left Albania on 15 October 2015. The Appellant's
       claim for asylum was based on the fact that, having  been  trafficked
       into prostitution from September  2014  to  April  2015,  she  feared
       serious harm either at the hands of her traffickers who would wish to
       punish her for escaping from them, or at the hands of her father  who
       would punish her for bringing shame on the family. She  escaped  from
       her traffickers and stayed at a friend's  house  for  over  a  month,
       where she met [VT], who she married in [~] 2015.

    3. She and her husband  subsequently  left  the  country  together.  She
       separated from her husband during the  journey  after  he  discovered
       that she had previously worked as a prostitute. Her daughter [AK] was
       born here on 21 December 2015. The documents did  not  establish  the
       identity of [A]'s father.

    4. She attended a screening interview on 1  February  2016  and  had  an
       asylum interview on 21 April 2016.  She  was  then  referred  to  the
       National Referral Mechanism for a determination of whether she was  a
       victim of modern slavery. The NRM issued a negative decision on  that
       claim.

    5. The parties agreed before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  no  further
       evidence should be given by the Appellant in relation to  her  asylum
       claim, in the light of their understanding that the authority of  AUJ
       Bangladesh limited the Tribunal's jurisdiction in these cases, to  an
       enquiry into whether the competent authority's  decision  within  the
       NRM mechanism was perverse or irrational. Only  if  the  Tribunal  so
       concluded would it be able to  re-determine  the  issue  for  itself,
       taking account of all material matters including evidence  postdating
       the NRM decision. Nevertheless, in  the  course  of  submissions  the
       Appellant's counsel referred  to  the  different  standard  of  proof
       governing  asylum  claims   to   that   governing   the   trafficking
       determination process, and submitted that "The decision was  perverse
       as the evidence has moved on."

    6. The First-tier Tribunal concluded that the  Secretary  of  State  had
       correctly  identified  aspects  of  her  account  that  were   indeed
       inconsistent  and  implausible.  Thus  the  NRM's  decision  was  not
       irrational and thus that no further evidence  was  admissible  before
       it.

    7. She would not face serious harm as a single female returning  with  a
       child because the evidence regarding the  problems  such  individuals
       faced was inapplicable to an educated returnee with family members to
       help her. There was some evidence of mental health and  PTSD  issues,
       but no up-to-date report had been forthcoming; the available evidence
       could not cross the Article 3 threshold, and any private life she had
       established in the  UK  was  established  whilst  her  residence  was
       precarious.


    8. Grounds of appeal forcefully contended that the approach taken by the
       First-tier Tribunal  was  legally  untenable  in  the  light  of  the
       governing authorities for  determining  an  asylum  or  human  rights
       appeal raising trafficking issues,  the  Judge  having  deprived  the
       Appellant of the effective remedy that European  Union  law  demanded
       and made a decision on refugee status incompatibly with the  standard
       of proof mandated by Karanakaran, and that this was the case  whether
       or not the Appellant's former advocate  had  been  complicit  in  the
       approach adopted.


    9. Before me Ms Holmes accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had plainly
       erred in law given the legal framework as explained by decisions such
       as AUJ. Ms Loughran agreed, with appropriate concision.

  Findings and reasons

   10. As the advocates before me joined in accepting that the  approach  of
       the First-tier Tribunal was flawed I can be brief  in  my  reasoning.
       Appeals arising out of trafficking claims will  sometimes  mean  that
       the available material before a Judge will include a  decision  under
       the NRM process from the competent authority.


   11. For a period the proper approach was put in doubt  by the decision of
       the Court of Appeal in MS (Afghanistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 594, where it
       was held that in circumstances where a negative trafficking  decision
       by the Competent Authority had not been challenged by way of judicial
       review, the  First-tier  Tribunal  may  only  entertain  an  indirect
       challenge  to  such  a  decision  if  the  trafficking  decision   is
       demonstrated to be perverse or irrational or one which was  not  open
       to the Competent Authority.  In  AUJ  (Trafficking  -  no  conclusive
       grounds decision) Bangladesh [2018] UKUT 200 (IAC) the Upper Tribunal
       touched upon this issue, opining:

           "62.   In  my   view,   applying   AS   (Afghanistan)   and   MS
           (Afghanistan),  cases  in  which  the  Competent  Authority  has
           reached a " Conclusive Grounds decision" should be approached as
           follows:


                (i)    Where  there  is  a  positive  "  Conclusive  Grounds
                decision" and the Secretary of State has complied  with  her
                duty to provide reparation are unlikely to come  before  the
                Tribunal before such time as  the  individual  concerned  is
                refused a renewal of his residence permit and faces removal.
                In such cases, the judge should not go behind  the  decision
                of the Competent Authority that the appellant was  a  victim
                of trafficking or modern  slavery.  The  focus  will  be  on
                whether removal of the appellant at that stage would  be  in
                breach of the United Kingdom's obligations under the Refugee
                Convention or in breach of his rights under the ECHR.


                (ii)   In cases in which the Competent Authority has reached
                a negative " Conclusive Grounds decision" but the  appellant
                continues to rely (in his statutory  appeal)  upon  evidence
                that he has been a victim of trafficking or modern  slavery,
                the judge should decide, at the start  of  the  hearing  and
                before oral evidence is given, whether the decision  of  the
                Competent  Authority  was  perverse  or  irrational  or  not
                reasonably open to it. At this stage, evidence subsequent to
                the decision of the Competent Authority must  not  be  taken
                into account. If (and only if) the judge concludes that  the
                Competent Authority's decision was perverse or irrational or
                one that was not reasonably open to it, that the  judge  can
                then re-determine the relevant facts  and  take  account  of
                subsequent evidence."

   12. However, in the context of a  decision  that  was  more  directly  on
       point, the Upper Tribunal revisited the issue in ES [2018]  UKUT  335
       (IAC):

           "1.   Following the  amendment  to  s  82  of  the  Nationality,
           Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ('the 2002 Act'), effective from
           20 October 2014, a  previous  decision  made  by  the  Competent
           Authority within the National Referral Mechanism  (made  on  the
           balance of probabilities) is not of  primary  relevance  to  the
           determination of an asylum appeal, despite the decisions of  the
           Court of Appeal in AS (Afghanistan) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ  1469
           and SSHD v MS (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 594.


           2.    The correct  approach  to  determining  whether  a  person
           claiming to be a victim of trafficking is entitled to asylum  is
           to consider all the evidence in the round  as  at  the  date  of
           hearing, applying the lower standard of proof."

   13. The Judge in ES noted that her predecessor in AUJ had  made  comments
       which appeared to support the construction of MS (Afghanistan) at one
       time preferred by the Secretary of State (and adopted by  the  First-
       tier Tribunal below), but which did not form any  part  of  the  head
       note to the decision and which were thus "clearly obiter."


   14. The thinking in ES is at one with the observation of Farbey J  in  MN
       [2018] EWHC 3268 (QB) �60-4 that the Court of Appeal in MS (Pakistan)
       was not aiming to change the function of the Tribunal in  asylum  and
       Article 3 cases - the lower standard of proof applies where  ECHR  or
       Refugee Convention issues are in play.


   15. The lower standard of proof is a central tenet of decision making  in
       the Refugee Convention status determination process, and in  relation
       to the assessment of claims  brought  by  reference  to  Humanitarian
       Protection and/or Article 3 ECHR. In Sivakumaran [1988] 1 AC 958  the
       House of Lords accepted that the same standard of proof  applied  for
       prognosticating future risks of harm in an asylum claim as  prevailed
       in extradition cases: when deciding whether an  applicant's  fear  of
       persecution was well-founded it is sufficient for a decision-maker to
       be satisfied that there was a reasonable degree  of  likelihood  that
       the applicant would be persecuted for a Convention reason if returned
       to  his  own  country.  In  this  regard,  there  is  no  significant
       difference  between  such  expressions  as  "a  reasonable   chance",
       "substantial grounds for thinking", and "a  serious  possibility"  as
       means of describing the degree of likelihood. These days the  concept
       is often summarised as whether there is a "real chance" of the feared
       persecution eventuating. Karanakaran [2000] EWCA Civ 11  demonstrates
       that the low standard of proof carries over from risk  assessment  to
       the determination of facts: in that  appeal  Brooke  and  Sedley  LJJ
       recommended that in asylum cases decision makers should consider each
       part of evidence, determining what they  believe  to  be  true,  that
       which  they  reject,  and  that  which  remains  in   doubt,   before
       considering all of it together in a holistic balancing exercise.


   16. Indeed, given that Refugee Convention decision making lies within the
       field of European Union  law,  the  standard  of  proof  set  out  in
       Directive 2004/83 necessarily applies, for refugees at  Article  2(c)
       being the "well-founded fear" standard, and for subsidiary protection
       claims ("humanitarian protection" as transposed in the  UK),  whether
       "substantial grounds have been shown for believing  that  the  person
       concerned ... would face a real risk of suffering serious harm".


   17. Accordingly it is clear that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  in
       treating itself as effectively bound  by  the  findings  of  the  NRM
       within the context of the statutory appeal predicated on Refugee  and
       Human Rights Convention grounds of appeal. The NRM has  institutional
       competence  over  trafficking  issues  that  are  determined  to  the
       standard of proof of balance of probabilities. It has no jurisdiction
       to determine asylum and human rights claims. Similarly the First-tier
       Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  has  jurisdiction  over
       claims arising from the Human Rights and Refugee Conventions; it does
       not have institutional competence for the ultimate conclusion  as  to
       whether a migrant is to be treated as a Victim of Trafficking for the
       purposes of administrative decision making in the context of the UK's
       obligations in relation to the Council of Europe Convention on Action
       against Trafficking in Human Beings, although its appellate  findings
       are doubtless a matter which the competent authority  would  wish  to
       have careful regard.


   18. The fact that the Appellant's advocate below may have been  complicit
       in the Tribunal's misdirection is nothing to the point.  Firstly,  as
       noted by Lord Hobhouse in Grobbelaar  v  News  Group  Newspapers  Ltd
       [2002] UKHL 40: "Still less is it right to decide  appeals  upon  the
       basis of upholding wrong decisions arrived at using legally  mistaken
       'concessions' by counsel." Secondly, it is  a  general  principle  of
       appellate law and procedure that a party cannot influence an issue of
       jurisdiction by consent. Essentially the First-tier Tribunal believed
       it lacked jurisdiction to revisit the  credibility  findings  on  the
       trafficking case notwithstanding that the  same  factual  issues  now
       arose vis-�-vis the UK's obligations  under  the  Refugee  and  Human
       Rights Conventions. However, as shown by ES and MN that was  not  the
       case.


   19. As already indicated, the decision cannot stand and the  appeal  must
       be remitted for re-hearing afresh.

Decision

The appeal is allowed to  the  extent  it  is  remitted  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for re-hearing afresh.
