For the Respondent:    Ms U Dirie instructed by Migrant Legal Project

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/2698) I  make  an  anonymity  order.   Unless  the  Upper
    Tribunal or Court directs otherwise, no  report  of  these  proceedings
    shall directly or indirectly identify  the  respondent  ("NOT").   This
    direction applies to both the appellant and to  the  respondent  and  a
    failure to comply with this direction could lead to Contempt  of  Court
    proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The respondent (whom I will hereafter refer to as the "claimant") is  a
    citizen of South Africa who was born on 21 October 1979.  She  came  to
    the United Kingdom on 2 December 2007 with entry clearance as a working
    holidaymaker.  Her leave was valid until 20 January 2008.

 3. Whilst in the UK, in September 2006 the  appellant  met  "V",  a  South
    African citizen who had been in the UK  since  2006  with  leave  as  a
    working holidaymaker.  They dated  and  over  time  their  relationship
    developed.

 4. In December 2006, the  claimant  returned  to  South  Africa  to  spend
    Christmas with her family  but  did  not  tell  them  about  V  as  the
    relationship was not yet serious.   Having  returned  to  the  UK,  the
    claimant again returned to South Africa in October  2007  in  order  to
    renew her passport.  While she was in South Africa she told  her  older
    sister about her relationship with V.  This included that the  claimant
    and V were from different tribes.  Her family did not  react  well  and
    her uncle (her father had died when she was  a  baby)  forbade  her  to
    marry V.  The claimant returned  to  the  UK  in  December  2007.   The
    claimant and V began to live together and the claimant became pregnant.
     Their daughter ("X") was born on 26 May 2012.

 5. Prior to X's birth her family learnt that  she  was  pregnant  and  she
    received threats from her family.  One of her uncles threatened to kill
    V and behead X if they returned to South Africa.  Before the  birth  of
    X, the claimant's  mother  advised  her  to  terminate  the  pregnancy.
    Efforts by V's family to negotiate, through the customary  practise  of
    Lobola  by  paying  damages  for  the  dishonour  of  the  inter-tribal
    relationship and pregnancy, failed.  Thereafter, the claimant  remained
    in the UK.

 6. The claimant and V had a second child, a son "Y" who was born in the UK
    on 12 January 2016.

 7. Both the claimant and V had leave, as  I  have  already  indicated,  as
    working holidaymakers and their leave was due to expire  in  or  around
    2008.  Towards the end  of  their  respective  periods  of  leave,  the
    claimant and V took  legal  advice  from  a  solicitor  and  they  were
    subsequently issued with letters (dated respectively 10 June  2008  and
    14 July 2008) which purported to grant each of them indefinite leave to
    remain ("ILR") with effect from 10 June 2008.

 8. They had been referred to the solicitor by a friend.  In December 2012,
    that friend was stopped at Heathrow Airport on her way to South  Africa
    and was told that the ILR stamp in her passport  was  a  forgery.   She
    informed the claimant and V who then sought  advice  from  a  different
    legal representative.  They reported the matter to the police and  were
    in contact with their local Member of Parliament.  In early 2014,  they
    received confirmation that their ILR stamps were  also  forgeries.   At
    that time, both the claimant and V were in employment but, as a  result
    of the ILR stamps being forgeries, they ceased work immediately.

 9. On 14 May 2014, the claimant claimed asylum.  She did so on  the  basis
    that she and her family were at risk on return to South Africa from her
    uncle who had threatened to kill V and behead their daughter, X.

10. On 23 April 2015, the Secretary of State refused the claimant's  claims
    for asylum, humanitarian protection and under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal

11. The claimant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Lebasci
    allowed the claimant's appeal on asylum grounds.  First,  she  accepted
    that there was a real risk of persecution to the claimant in  her  home
    area on the basis of the threats from her family in  South  Africa,  in
    particular her uncle.  The judge found that the threats from her  uncle
    "remain live/current".  Secondly, the judge found that  she  would  not
    obtain  a  'sufficiency  of  protection'   from   the   South   African
    authorities.  Thirdly, the judge found that  the  appellant  could  not
    reasonably be expected to relocate within South Africa to  a  different
    urban area from her home area (as was  proposed  by  the  Secretary  of
    State) because there was  a  real  risk  that  her  location  would  be
    discovered by her family, in particular through social media contact.

12. The Secretary of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal which was granted by the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Kimnell)
    on 30 August 2016.

13. The appeal in the Upper  Tribunal  was  initially  listed  before  DUTJ
    Davey.  He rejected the Secretary of  State's  first  ground  that  the
    judge had erred in law in finding that there was  an  insufficiency  of
    protection  available  in  South  Africa.   However,  he  accepted  the
    Secretary of State's second ground was made out, namely that the  judge
    had erred in law in concluding that the claimant could  not  internally
    relocate which he  found  was  inadequately  reasoned.   Judge  Davey's
    reasons are set out in full in his decision dated 3 April 2017 and I do
    not repeat them here.   As a result, Judge Davey adjourned the  hearing
    in order that a resumed hearing could take place in the Upper  Tribunal
    to remake the decision in respect of the claimant's asylum appeal.  The
    only outstanding issue was that of internal relocation.

14. Subsequently, a transfer order was made and  the  resumed  hearing  was
    listed before me on 31 May 2017.

The Resumed Hearing

15. It was common ground between Ms Dirie, who represented the claimant and
    Mr Mills who represented the Secretary of State that the two  issues  I
    have to determine are:

    (1)  Whether the claimant could be expected to internally  relocate  in
         South Africa - if she could not her claim for asylum succeeded; and



    (2)  Whether her return to South Africa would breach Art 8 of the ECHR.



16. Ms Dirie sought to admit in evidence  a  further  bundle  of  documents
    under rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    to which Mr Mills raised no objection.

17. The principal evidence relied upon consisted of two statements from the
    claimant dated 10 May 2016 (at A1-A6 of the FtT bundle) and 22 May 2017
    (at A1-A3 of the UT bundle)  and  her  oral  evidence  before  me;  the
    statement of V dated 10 May 2016 (at A7-A8 of the FtT  bundle);  and  a
    letter from V's aunt dated 23 September 2014  (at  A9-A14  of  the  FtT
    bundle) and her witness statement dated 22 May 2017 (A4-A5 UT  bundle).
    The bundle also contained  a  number  of  documents  dealing  with  the
    claimant and her children's  circumstances  in  the  UK  together  with
    documents relating to the Facebook activity of the claimant, V and  V's
    aunt.

Internal Relocation

18. It was accepted by both representatives that the sole issue in  respect
    of the claimant's asylum claim was whether she  could  be  expected  to
    internally relocate to another part of South Africa away from her  home
    area of Sebokeng.  Although Mr Mills did not restrict this  option,  in
    his submissions, to another urban area in South Africa that was clearly
    a limitation envisaged by  the  Secretary  of  State  in  her  decision
    letter.  At para 77, the Secretary of State concluded that:  "It  would
    be reasonable for you to stay in Pretoria, Cape Town or  Durban."   The
    submissions, however, focused on  the  claimant's  evidence  concerning
    what, if any, risk there was to her and her family  on  return  in  the
    urban areas of Johannesburg, Pretoria, Durban and Cape Town.

    The Law

19. The internal relocation requirement is set out  in  para  339O  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) as follows:

         "339O.   (i)  The Secretary of State will not make:

                      (a)  a grant of asylum if in part of the  country  of
                           origin a person would not  have  a  well  founded
                           fear of being  persecuted,  and  the  person  can
                           reasonably be expected to stay in  that  part  of
                           the country; or

                      (b)  ....

                  (ii)     In examining whether a part  of  the  country  of
                      origin or country of return meets the requirements in
                      (i) the Secretary of State, when making his  decision
                      on  whether   to   grant   asylum   or   humanitarian
                      protection,  will  have   regard   to   the   general
                      circumstances prevailing in that part of the  country
                      and to the personal circumstances of the person.

                  (iii)    (i) applies notwithstanding  technical  obstacles
                      to return to the country  of  origin  or  country  of
                      return."

20. Two issues arise in the context of internal relocation.  First, it will
    not be reasonable to expect an individual to return to a different part
    of their own  country  where  the  very  risk  that  they  fear  arises
    elsewhere.  That issue  was  at  the  heart  of  the  claimant's  case.
    Second, it will not be reasonable to expect an individual  to  relocate
    if it would be "unduly harsh" to expect  them  to  do  so.   That  test
    imposes a high threshold but it does not require that it be established
    that the risk of persecution or serious ill-treatment contrary to Art 3
    of the ECHR would arise elsewhere in the country of origin (see SSHD  v
    AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49 at [9] per  Lord  Bingham).   In  determining
    whether  internal  relocation  would  be   "unduly   harsh"   all   the
    circumstances must be considered including the availability of  medical
    care, the ability to earn a living and find  accommodation,  particular
    account must be taken of family links, ethnic affiliations, the ability
    to live a life at least at subsistence level and whether support  might
    be forthcoming from sources in the country of  origin  or  abroad  (see
    Januzi v SSHD [2006] UKHL 5).

    The Evidence

21. The claimant's evidence was that she could not live  in  any  of  these
    urban areas without being at risk from her family.

22. First, she could not live in Johannesburg as that  was  only  about  30
    minutes from Pretoria where V's family lived and if  they  returned  to
    Pretoria that would put his family at risk as well.

23. Second, she could not live in Cape Town  because  a  cousin  lived  and
    worked there and that was thirdly, also true of Durban.   The  claimant
    said she ran the risk of running into one of them which would lead back
    to her uncle knowing where she was.

24. The claimant's evidence was that she was active on social media and had
    over 800 friends who, in turn, had others.  Her evidence was  that  she
    could not be expected forever not to use social  media.   Even  if  she
    did, that would raise a suspicion and  her  presence  in  South  Africa
    might then be discovered also.  Further, her daughter X, who is 6 years
    old, used social media to keep in contact with  family.   The  claimant
    said that, in effect,  she  and  her  family  would  have  to  go  into
    isolation to avoid detection via social media.  Further, if she were to
    bump into someone who knew her she would have to warn them not  to  put
    any mention of her on social media.  It would, she said, mean that  she
    would have to tell everyone  that  she  was  not  free.   She  did  not
    consider that she could stop X from ever using social media.   Further,
    she would have to cut off links with her family and her daughter  would
    have to stop living a "social life" if they went back to South  Africa.
    The claimant would have to not attend social events which might lead to
    information being put on social media which would lead to her discovery
    by her family in South Africa.

25. The claimant said that in addition to relatives or  others  identifying
    her, her uncle owned a taxi business which ran throughout South  Africa
    and she believed that she might be identified by a driver which, again,
    would lead back to her uncle.

26. In addition, the claimant said that V's aunt was a high profile  member
    of society working for a national sporting  organisation.   She  was  a
    very social person and was always posting on social media.  She did not
    believe that, even if they asked V's aunt not to mention them, that she
    could keep that quiet in the long run.

27. The claimant said that if she returned to South Africa she  would  have
    to "look over [her] shoulder".  She said that she could not control how
    others used Facebook; she could not control everybody else  and  feared
    that someone would disclose her presence in South Africa,  not  through
    any ill will but, in effect, inadvertently.

28. The evidence of the claimant was supported by V and his aunt and it  is
    not necessary to set their evidence out here which was  not  challenged
    by Mr Mills.

    The Submissions

29. Mr Mills accepted, as Judge Lebasci had done, that the appellant had an
    objective fear in her home area.  He  also  accepted  that  she  had  a
    subjective fear elsewhere but submitted that fear was  not  objectively
    well-founded.  He submitted that it was speculative that  her  presence
    in other urban areas such as Pretoria where only V's family lived or in
    Durban and Cape Town where only a cousin lived created a real  risk  of
    being discovered.  He submitted that it was simply  not  credible  that
    taxi  drivers  across  the  country  would  know  her  and  pass   that
    information on to her uncle.  He submitted that the claimant  could  be
    expected to desist from social network activity and reduce  her  social
    life, for example by not attending family events such as weddings.   He
    submitted that this was not a fundamental right  as  recognised  in  HJ
    (Iran) v SSHD [2010] UKSC 31 and RT (Zimbabwe) v SSHD  [2012]  UKSC  38
    for sexual orientation or political opinion and she could  be  expected
    to limit her social activity, if necessary, for the rest of  her  life.
    That did not make her, he submitted, a refugee.

30. Ms Dirie submitted that the evidence was that the claimant  had  uncles
    living in the Cape and in Johannesburg and  so  she  could  not  return
    there safely.  She could not be expected to return to Pretoria  because
    her partner's family in Pretoria who would be at risk and that she  had
    cousins living in Durban and Cape  Town.   Further,  her  social  media
    activity was an  intrinsic  part  of  her  life  and  it  would  arouse
    suspicion if she stopped actively using it.  Ms Dirie submitted that  I
    should find that her uncles and cousins kept an  eye  on  her  Facebook
    pages as was accepted by the First-tier Tribunal.  Whilst  the  use  of
    social media was, Ms Dirie accepted, not a fundamental right or freedom
    like political opinion or religion, nevertheless it  was  an  intrinsic
    part of how one expressed oneself and would effectively lead to  social
    isolation for her, her partner and children.

    My Findings and Conclusion

31. I found the  claimant  to  be  an  entirely  convincing  witness  whose
    evidence was not shaken or undermined in any significant way by  cross-
    examination.  There is no doubt that she has a genuine subjective  fear
    based upon the risk from her uncle contained in his threats to  kill  V
    and  behead  their  daughter  X.   That  risk  has  been  found  to  be
    objectively well-founded in her own area.  Further, it is accepted that
    there is no sufficiency of protection against that threat if it were to
    eventuate anywhere in South Africa.  On the other hand,  leaving  aside
    the issue of social media, whilst I accept the subjective fear  of  the
    claimant, her fear that she will be identified in, for example, a major
    South African city such as Durban or Cape Town because she has a cousin
    or cousin who work there and they might "bump into" her or  her  family
    is, in my judgment, speculation given that the  respective  populations
    of those two cities is over two million.  Likewise, although it is only
    30 minutes from Johannesburg where one of her  uncles  lives,  Pretoria
    has a population of over one million.  On that evidence alone, I  would
    not be satisfied  that  there  was  a  real  risk  that  she  would  be
    identified and, therefore, as a consequence at risk from her  uncle(s).
    I also do not accept that  her  presence  is  likely  to  become  known
    through her uncle's taxi business.  There is no realistic prospect that
    some unidentified employee of her uncle would, if she were to  ride  in
    one of his taxis, identify the claimant and therefore be in a  position
    to report it back to her uncle.

32. However, that is not the totality of the evidence in this case.  In  my
    judgment, if the claimant continues (or her daughter continues) to  use
    social media if they return to South Africa there is a real  risk  that
    her presence and location will come to the notice of  her  uncles  whom
    Judge Lebasci  accepted  had  a  continuing  interest  in  finding  the
    claimant.  The only way to avoid this risk would be to desist from  all
    social media activity.

33. I accept Mr Mills' submission, which in any event Ms Dirie acknowledged
    was correct, that any right to engage  in  social  interaction  through
    social media was not a fundamental right akin to those recognised in HJ
    (Iran) and RT (Zimbabwe) of  political  opinion,  religious  belief  or
    sexual identity.  Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly  a  central  part  of
    many individuals' human existence across the world today.  It is a form
    of self expression or part of an  individual's  right  to  develop  and
    maintain personal relationships that, in my judgment, falls within  the
    protected area of "private life" under Art 8 of the ECHR.  It falls  in
    my judgment within the scope of Art 8 as identified by  the  Strasbourg
    Court in Pretty v UK (2002) 35 EHRR 1 at [61]:

          "As the Court has had previous occasion to remark, the concept  of
         "private life" is  a  broad  term  not  susceptible  to  exhaustive
         definition. It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a
         person (see X and Y v. the Netherlands, judgment of 26 March 1985,
         Series A no. 91, p. 11, � 22). It can sometimes embrace aspects of
         an individual's  physical  and  social  identity  (see  Mikulic  v.
         Croatia, no. 53176/99, � 53, ECHR 2002-I). Elements  such  as,  for
         example, gender identification, name  and  sexual  orientation  and
         sexual life fall within the personal sphere protected by Article  8
         (see, for example,  B.  v.  France,  judgment  of  25  March  1992,
         Series A no. 232-C, pp. 53-54, �  63;  Burghartz  v.  Switzerland,
         judgment of 22 February 1994, Series A no. 280-B,  p.  28,  �  24;
         Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 22 October 1981,  Series
         A no. 45, pp. 18-19, � 41; and Laskey,  Jaggard  and  Brown,  cited
         above, p. 131, � 36). Article 8 also protects a right  to  personal
         development, and the right to establish and  develop  relationships
         with other human beings and the outside world  (see,  for  example,
         Burghartz, cited above, opinion of the Commission, p. 37, � 47, and
         Friedl v. Austria, judgment of 31 January 1995, Series A no. 305-B,
         opinion of the Commission, p. 20, � 45). Although no previous  case
         has established as such any right to  self-determination  as  being
         contained in Article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers  that
         the  notion  of  personal  autonomy  is  an   important   principle
         underlying the interpretation of its guarantees."

34. That, in my judgment, reflects the importance to many individuals' well-
    being and existence - no better evidenced in modern day  life  than  by
    widespread (sometimes obsessive)  use  of  social  media  -  of  inter-
    personal communication and contacts with other human beings.  It  is  a
    highly relevant factor in determining  whether  the  claimant  and  her
    family can be expected to desist from any communication or  contact  in
    South Africa.

35. Whilst it might  be  reasonable  to  expect  an  individual  to  desist
    temporarily or for a short period of time from social media activity as
    part of their everyday personal life, it would  not  be  reasonable  to
    require the claimant, V and her daughter to  desist  for  the  rest  of
    their lives whilst living in South Africa.  That, in  my  judgment,  is
    unescapably unreasonable as it would impose an unacceptable  diminution
    in the living conditions of the claimant and her family on return.   It
    would also impose unrealistic burdens upon the claimant to require  (or
    practically ensure) others never to  disclose  her  presence  in  South
    Africa, including friends, V's aunt and anyone with  whom  she  or  her
    family interacted in South Africa.  The claimant and her family  would,
    of necessity, have to become socially  isolated  avoiding  events  that
    might lead to social media exposure by others over whom she would  have
    no effective control.  The 'snowball' effect of social media posting is
    self-evident in the modern world.  Everybody's business becomes  public
    property once posted and in large measure is then beyond the  effective
    control of the individual.

36. Taking into account all the evidence, I find that there is a real  risk
    that the claimant's presence in South Africa would  be  discovered  and
    come to the attention of her uncle(s) unless (which  cannot  reasonably
    be expected of her), the claimant and her  family  desist  from  social
    media and other social interactions.  In any event, even  if  they  did
    desist, the claimant and her family would live in  the  shadow  of  the
    fear that their presence and identity might be inadvertently  disclosed
    and her uncles discover her presence putting V and X in danger.

37. Taking all these matters into account, I am satisfied that it would  be
    unreasonable and unduly harsh to expect the claimant (with her  family)
    to live in these circumstances in another urban area in  South  Africa.
    Although Mr Mills did not pursue with any  vigour  the  possibility  of
    internal relocation to a rural area (which was not relied upon  in  the
    refusal letter) I  am  satisfied,  in  any  event,  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the claimant and her husband who  come  from  an
    urban existence to live in rural South Africa with their children.

38. For these reasons, I accept that  the  claimant  cannot  reasonably  be
    expected to relocate within South Africa and consequently her claim for
    asylum succeeds.

Article 8

39. That, then, leaves the claimant's claim under Art 8 of the ECHR.

40. In applying Art 8, I apply the 5-stage test set out  in  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27.

41. First, I accept that the  claimant  and  her  family  have  established
    private and family life in the UK.  If returned to  South  Africa  they
    will be forced  into  social  isolation  including  taking  away  their
    present ability to remain in contact with their family in South  Africa
    by social media.  That will, as I found  earlier,  have  a  significant
    impact  upon  the  claimant,  her  partner  and  children  (the  latter
    increasingly as they grow older).  I am, therefore, satisfied that  the
    claimant's removal to South Africa will sufficiently interfere with her
    private and family life and those of her family members (who also  must
    be considered applying Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008]  UKHL  39)  so  as  to
    engage Art 8.1.  Indeed, Mr Mills did not seek to argue otherwise.

42. Turning to Art 8.2, the  claimant's  removal  will  clearly  be  for  a
    legitimate  aim,  here  characterised  as  the  effective  control   of
    immigration (see s.117B(1) of the NIA Act 2002).  That removal will  be
    in accordance with the law.  The crucial issue is  whether  the  public
    interest requires the claimant's removal.

43. That issue requires a fair balance to be struck between the rights  and
    interests of the claimant and her  family  and  the  interests  of  the
    community represented by the public interest (see Razgar  at  [20]  per
    Lord Bingham; R(Agyarko and another) v SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 at [60]  per
    Lord Reed).

44. In reaching any  conclusion,  the  best  interests  of  the  claimant's
    children are a primary but  not  determinative  consideration  (see  ZH
    (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 and Zoumbas  v  SSHD  [2013]  UKSC  74.
    especially at [10]).

45. I begin with para 276ADE(1)(vi) relied upon by the claimant.  In  order
    to succeed, it must be established that  there  are  "very  significant
    obstacles" to her reintegration into South Africa.

46. Ms Dirie invited me to find that the claimant's circumstances on return
    to South Africa meant that there were "very significant  obstacles"  to
    her reintegration and so she succeeded under para 276ADE(1)(vi) of  the
    Rules.  Mr Mills submitted that the test under para 276ADE(1)(vi) was a
    high one and, following Treebhawon and Others  (NIAA  2002  Part  5A  -
    compelling circumstances test) [2017] UKUT 13 (IAC), that test was  not
    established by "mere hardship,  mere  difficulty,  mere  hurdles,  mere
    upheaval and mere inconvenience, even where multiplied" when living  in
    that country and was more or less, to use his words, "on  a  par"  with
    the test of undue harshness.

47. I accept that the test of "very significant obstacles" imposes a 'high'
    hurdle for a claimant to establish.  I have already set out  above  the
    circumstances of the claimant and  her  family  if  returned  to  South
    Africa (see above).  Whilst there is no doubt that they would  be  able
    to  obtain  employment,  find  accommodation  and  live  in  an   urban
    environment in South Africa, they would do so in the  circumstances  of
    social isolation that I have identified earlier  when  considering  the
    issue of internal relocation.  That isolation is, in my  judgment,  the
    very antithesis of "integration" in South African society.  There  are,
    in my judgment, "very significant obstacles"  to  them  living  in  any
    other way in order to avoid the risk to them from the claimant's uncles
    in South Africa.  The circumstances of the claimant on  return,  in  my
    view, fall within para 276ADE(1)(vi).

48. For that reason the claimant is entitled to succeed under Art 8 as  the
    balance to be struck  between  the  claimant's  circumstances  and  the
    public interest reflected in the Immigration Rules by the Secretary  of
    State has been stuck in the claimant's favour  (see  Agyarko  at  [46]-
    [47]).

49. However, even if that were not the case, I am satisfied that there  are
    "compelling  circumstances"  giving   rise   to   unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences which outweigh the public interest (see Agyarko at  [48]).



50. As regard a claim under Art 8 outside the  Rules,  Ms  Dirie  submitted
    that there were  "compelling  circumstances"  to  outweigh  the  public
    interest.  She relied on the best  interests  of  X  and  a  letter  of
    support from her school at page A13 of the UT  bundle.   She  submitted
    that it was clearly in X's best  interest  to  remain  in  her  present
    environment in the UK rather than  one  of  self-imposed  isolation  in
    South Africa.  As regard Part 5A of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 she relied upon a number of factors set out in para  26
    of her skeleton.  She  submitted  that  the  claimant  would  be  self-
    sufficient if they were permitted to work, the claimant and her partner
    both spoke English, their private and family life in the  UK  had  been
    formed at a time when they honestly believed they had ILR and this  was
    not a case where, she submitted, no weight should  be  given  to  their
    private and family life under  s.117B(4)  and  (5)  because  they  were
    unaware that their immigration status was precarious or unlawful.

51. Mr Mills conceded that there were arguably  "compelling  circumstances"
    based upon the interests of the children including the  potential  risk
    to them on return, that the claimant  and  her  partner  had  been  the
    innocent victims of a fraud believing that they had ILR.   However,  he
    submitted that it was in the children's best interests to be with their
    parents.  He accepted that they both spoke English  and  therefore  the
    public interest in s.117B(2) was not engaged.  He  submitted  that  the
    evidence was unclear as to whether or  not  they  would  have  adequate
    income so  as  to  be  financially  independent  for  the  purposes  of
    s.117B(3) but he accepted that this was not a strong point.  He invited
    me to find that there were not  sufficiently  compelling  circumstances
    but he accepted that I could rationally reach the opposite conclusion.

52. First, Mr Mills, in his submissions, conceded that the circumstances of
    the children and any potential risk was  an  important  aspect  of  the
    proportionality issue.   Whilst it might in general be said that it  is
    in the best interests  of  the  claimant's  children  to  be  with  the
    claimant whether she and her partner are in the UK or South Africa,  in
    the particular circumstances of this case, I am  satisfied  that  there
    will be a significant detriment to their interests if returned to South
    Africa because of the need for social isolation in order to protect the
    family from the threats from the claimant's uncle.  The  evidence  also
    shows, in particular in relation to X,  a  continuing  development  and
    life in the UK (see  letter  from  her  school  at  page  A13).   I  am
    satisfied that it would not be in their best interests to live in South
    Africa.

53. Second, although the family life of the claimant and her  partner  were
    formed  whilst  their  immigration  status  was  either  precarious  or
    unlawful as  they  were  never  validly  granted  ILR,  they  genuinely
    believed that they had been granted ILR until the possibility of  fraud
    by their legal representative was first raised at the end of  2012  and
    not confirmed by the Home Office until some  time  later,  probably  in
    2014.  The "little weight" provisions in s.117B(4) and  (5)  present  a
    spectrum dependent upon the circumstance of weight that must  be  given
    to an individual's private and family life (see Kaur  (children's  best
    interests/public interest interface) [2017] UKUT 14 (IAC);  Rhuppiah  v
    SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ 803).

54. Third, in my judgment, given the innocence  of  the  claimant  and  her
    partner in the fraud  which  was  perpetrated  by  their  (then)  legal
    representative, this is one of the unusual cases  where  despite  their
    presence being precarious or unlawful, their private  and  family  life
    established during that time is entitled to due weight.  I  accept  the
    claimant's evidence that had she not genuinely  believe  she  had  been
    granted ILR then, given the early stage of her relationship with V, she
    would have broken that relationship off and returned to South Africa  -
    in effect going along with the wishes of her family  in  South  Africa.
    As an innocent party to the forged grant of ILR, she genuinely believed
    (as did V) that they were entitled to remain in the UK indefinitely and
    so could set down roots  by,  for  example,  beginning  a  family  (see
    Agyarko at [53]).   X was, of course, born before the  claimant  and  V
    were even alerted to the possible fraud by their friend at the  end  of
    2012.

55. Fourth, as Ms Dirie  submitted,  and  Mr  Mills  accepted,  the  public
    interest in s.117B(2) is not engaged as they  all  speak  English.   As
    regards s.117B(3), there is nothing to suggest that  the  claimant  and
    her partner were not financially independent when they worked prior  to
    the discovery that the grant of ILR was a  forgery.   Mr  Mills  placed
    some reliance on the evidence before me that might not show adequacy of
    income for a family of four.  However, he acknowledged this was not his
    strongest point.  Even if it is  engaged,  which  I  have  considerable
    doubt it is, the public interest in s.117B(3) is only one of  a  number
    of factors to be considered.

56. Weighing up all the factors I have set out, and  seeking  to  strike  a
    fair balance between the public interest and those of the claimant  and
    her family in the  UK,  I  am  satisfied  that  there  are  "compelling
    circumstances" sufficient to outweigh any public interest  in  her  (or
    the family's) removal to South Africa.

57. Accordingly, I allow the appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

58. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside,  to  the  extent
    there set out, in the decision of DUTJ Davey dated 3 April 2017.

59. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal on asylum grounds
    and under Art 8 of the ECHR.
