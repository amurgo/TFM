                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of Judge Hubball of
    the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated on 16th April 2015.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FtT and I will refer to him as the Claimant.

 3. The Claimant is a male citizen of Pakistan born 23rd October  1991  who
    on 13th June 2014 applied for further leave to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom as the spouse of Shahida Arshad a British citizen,  to  whom  I
    shall refer as the Sponsor.

 4. The application was refused on 13th November 2014.   The  Secretary  of
    State noted that the Claimant and Sponsor were not  married,  and  they
    had not been residing together for two  years  prior  to  the  date  of
    application, and therefore the Sponsor was not the  Claimant's  spouse,
    neither did she satisfy the definition of a partner set out in  GEN.1.2
    of Appendix FM.   Therefore  the  application  was  refused  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 5. The Secretary of State went on to consider EX.1(b) but did  not  accept
    that insurmountable obstacles existed to family life continuing outside
    the United Kingdom.  In any event, it would appear  that  in  order  to
    qualify under EX.1(b) the Sponsor would need to satisfy the  definition
    of a partner.

 6. The Secretary of State did not accept that the Claimant was entitled to
    remain in the United Kingdom on the basis of his  private  life  as  he
    could not satisfy the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)  and  neither
    was it accepted that there  were  any  exceptional  circumstances  that
    would entitle him to be granted leave to remain outside the Immigration
    Rules in reliance upon Article 8 of the  1950  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).

 7. The Claimant appealed, and the FtT heard the appeal on 27th March 2015.
     By the time of the appeal, it  was  accepted  that  the  Claimant  and
    Sponsor had married on 7th January 2015.  The issue to  be  decided  by
    the  FtT  was  whether  the  Claimant  could  satisfy   the   financial
    requirements set out in E-LTRP.3.1.  The FtT found against the Claimant
    on this issue, not being satisfied that it had been proved  that  there
    was a specified gross annual income of at least ï¿½18,600 per annum.

 8. The FtT went on to consider EX.1(b) and allowed the appeal on the basis
    that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  continuing
    outside the United Kingdom.   Therefore  the  FtT  indicated  that  the
    appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules.

 9. This caused the Secretary of State to apply for permission to appeal to
    the Upper Tribunal.  In summary it was contended that the FtT had erred
    in finding that  insurmountable  obstacles  existed  and  had  provided
    inadequate reasons for that finding.  The Secretary of State  contended
    that insurmountable obstacles is a high threshold, and  the  fact  that
    individuals wished to remain in the United Kingdom, did not  amount  to
    insurmountable obstacles.  It was contended that the FtT had applied an
    incorrect test, by finding that it would be unreasonable to expect  the
    Sponsor to live in  Pakistan  when  she  is  a  British  citizen.   The
    Secretary  of  State   contended   that   the   appropriate   test   is
    insurmountable obstacles, which is a higher test than reasonableness.

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Kopieczek  in
    the following terms;

         "I consider it arguable that the First-tier Judge erred in  law  in
         his conclusion that there would be insurmountable obstacles to  the
         Appellant and his wife continuing their family  life  in  Pakistan,
         having regard to the meaning of insurmountable obstacles set out in
         EX.2."

11. Directions were issued making provision  for  there  to  be  a  hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal to decide whether the FtT decision  contained
    an error of law such that it should be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

12. The Claimant attended the hearing without legal representation.  He was
    not fluent in English and there was no interpreter.

13. The Sponsor also  attended  and  offered  to  assist  the  Claimant  by
    interpreting for him and speaking on his behalf.  Mr  Richards  had  no
    objection to this course of action, and in the circumstances I  decided
    it was appropriate to proceed on this basis.

14. I explained to the Claimant that I was aware that  his  solicitors  had
    sent a fax to the Tribunal on 15th February  2016  indicating  that  he
    wished to withdraw his appeal.  The  Claimant's  signed  authority  was
    enclosed with that letter.  At the same time the  solicitors  indicated
    that they were no longer instructed to represent  the  Claimant.   They
    advised that the Claimant had submitted a fresh application to the Home
    Office.

15. The Tribunal had replied to the solicitors on the same  date,  advising
    that the appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  made  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, and therefore it was not possible for the Claimant  to  withdraw
    that appeal.

16. The Claimant confirmed, with the assistance of  the  Sponsor,  that  he
    understood that  his  application  to  withdraw  the  appeal  had  been
    refused, and that he had attended the  hearing  in  person,  as  he  no
    longer wished to have solicitors representing him.

17. I explained to the Claimant the procedure that  would  be  adopted,  in
    that the Secretary of State had been granted permission to appeal,  and
    I would hear submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State as to  why
    it was contended that the FtT had made a mistake of law.  I would  then
    give the Claimant the opportunity to respond.

18. I advised again, that the Claimant could not at this stage withdraw the
    appeal.

19. The Claimant indicated that he understood and  would  proceed  on  that
    basis.





20. I then heard submissions from Mr Richards who relied upon  the  grounds
    contained within the application for permission to  appeal.   In  brief
    summary Mr Richards contended that the FtT had been wrong to find  that
    insurmountable obstacles existed to family life continuing outside  the
    United Kingdom.  The FtT  had  not  identified  what  very  significant
    difficulties existed that amounted to insurmountable obstacles.

21. By way of  response  the  Sponsor  spoke  on  behalf  of  the  Claimant
    indicating that she is a British citizen and all  of  her  family  live
    here.  She has a long employment history in the United Kingdom  and  it
    would be very difficult to relocate to Pakistan.

22. I announced at the hearing that the FtT had erred in law  as  contended
    by the Secretary of State.  I indicated that I would  issue  a  written
    decision giving and explaining my reasons.  I set aside the decision of
    the FtT.

23. At this point I advised the Claimant that because the decision  of  the
    FtT had been set aside, the decision needed to be re-made,  but  in  my
    view, if the Claimant now wished to withdraw his  appeal  then  he  was
    entitled to make that application.  Mr Richards confirmed that  he  had
    no objection to that course of action.

24. Having consulted with each other, the Sponsor and the Claimant  applied
    to withdraw the appeal that had been entered against the  Secretary  of
    State's decision to refuse  leave  to  remain.   I  consented  to  that
    application pursuant to regulation  17(2)  of  The  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

My Conclusions and Reasons

25. My reasons for finding that the FtT erred in law are as  follows.   The
    FtT  has  given  inadequate  reasons  for  finding   that   there   are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.  The
    FtT found that there would be very significant  difficulties  faced  by
    the Sponsor in  continuing  her  family  life  with  the  Appellant  in
    Pakistan, which would entail very serious hardship for her, but has not
    adequately explained what the very significant difficulties would be.

26. The FtT did not have the benefit of the guidance given by the Court  of
    Appeal in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440, which was  published  after  the
    FtT decision was promulgated.  However this decision clarifies what the
    law has always  been,  so  far  as  interpretation  of  "insurmountable
    obstacles" is concerned.

27. The Court of Appeal confirmed in  paragraph  21  of  Agyarko  that  the
    phrase "insurmountable obstacles" imposes a high hurdle to be  overcome
    by an applicant for leave to remain under the Immigration  Rules.   The
    test is significantly more demanding than a mere  test  of  whether  it
    would be reasonable to expect a couple to continue  their  family  life
    outside the United Kingdom.

28. In Agyarko the mere fact that the Sponsor is a British citizen, who had
    lived all his life in the  United  Kingdom,  and  had  a  job  in  this
    country, and hence might find it difficult and might  be  reluctant  to
    relocate outside the United Kingdom to continue family life,  was  held
    not to constitute insurmountable obstacles.

29. In this appeal the FtT found that the Sponsor is a British citizen, has
    employment in the United Kingdom, and has  family  here  and  wants  to
    remain here.  The FtT failed to adequately explain how that amounts  to
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the UK.

30. Having set aside the decision of the FtT, which meant that  the  appeal
    of the Secretary of State to the Upper Tribunal  had  been  allowed,  I
    took  the  view  that  it  was  appropriate  to  allow  the  Claimant's
    application to withdraw his appeal.  He clearly understood  the  nature
    of that application, as it was an application that had been made to the
    Tribunal by solicitors who at that stage were acting on his behalf.

31. This is therefore a slightly unusual scenario, but the result  is  that
    the appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed in that the decision of
    the FtT is set aside because of material error of law.  The  appeal  is
    then disposed of by the Claimant withdrawing  his  appeal  against  the
    initial decision to refuse him entry clearance.

Notice of Decision

The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed and the decision of the  FtT
is set aside.

The Claimant's application to withdraw his appeal  is  granted  pursuant  to
regulation 17(2) of the 2008 Procedure Rules.  Withdrawal notices should  be
sent to the parties with this decision.

Anonymity

The FtT made no anonymity direction.  There  has  been  no  application  for
anonymity made to the Upper Tribunal and I see no need to make an  anonymity
order.
