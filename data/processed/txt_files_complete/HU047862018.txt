                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. For ease of reference and the sake of continuity, we shall refer to the
    Appellant in these proceedings as the "Secretary of State"  and  to  Mr
    Welhenagamage as the Claimant.

 2. This is the remaking of the decision in the Claimant's  appeal  against
    the Secretary of State's decision of  18  January  2018,  refusing  his
    human rights claim made by way of an application for  entry  clearance.
    The claim had been made in order for the Claimant to join  his  spouse,
    Mrs Kanchana Nihathamani Jayamanna, a British citizen  ("the  Sponsor")
    in the United Kingdom.

 3. In refusing the claim, the Secretary of State had relied  on  a  single
    ground, namely that the financial requirements of Appendix  FM  to  the
    Immigration Rules ("the Rules") had not been met because of  a  failure
    to provide all of the specified evidence mandated by Appendix FM-SE.

 4. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Easterman  allowed  the  Claimant's  appeal
    against the refusal. He concluded that whilst the  Claimant  could  not
    satisfy the requirements of the Rules as a result  of  the  absence  of
    specified evidence, the Sponsor had been earning over  �20,000  a  year
    and this, together with the  existence  her  daughter  (the  Claimant's
    stepdaughter),  rendered  the  decision   disproportionate   and   thus
    unlawful.

 5. By a  decision  promulgated  on  10  April  2019,  Judge  Norton-Taylor
    concluded that the First-tier Tribunal had materially erred in  law  in
    two respects: first, by failing to take any or any adequate account  of
    the fact that the Claimant could not meet the Rules when assessing  the
    wider Article 8 claim; second, by failing to make  findings  and  reach
    conclusions on the Sponsor's daughter. The error  of  law  decision  is
    annexed, below.

 6. The case was adjourned at the error of law hearing in  order  that  the
    Claimant could adduce further evidence concerning the Sponsor's  income
    and her daughter. Any new evidence was subject to an application  under
    rule 15(2A) of the Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008.  Directions  to
    that effect were issued.

The scope of the remaking decision in this appeal

 7. As stated in para. 18 of the error  of  law  decision,  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's finding that the Sponsor was, at the time of the hearing  in
    January 2019, earning in excess of �20,000 a year, is preserved.

 8. The Secretary of State has always  expressly  accepted  the  Claimant's
    ability to  meet  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  as  regards  his
    relationship with the Sponsor, suitability, and  the  English  language
    criterion. None of these issues are live.

 9. The central issues in this appeal are now:

      a) The Sponsor's earnings and the evidence in support thereof;

      b) The relevance of the earnings to the Article 8 claim;

      c) The circumstances of the Sponsor's daughter and  the  relevance  of
         these to the Article 8 claim.

The evidence

10. In remaking the decision in this appeal, we  have  had  regard  to  the
    following sources of documentary evidence:

      a) The Secretary of State's appeal bundle;

      b) The  Claimant's  appeal  bundle  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
         running to 271 pages;

      c) Further evidence from the Claimant contained in a bundle, paginated
         1-37,  an  updated  witness  statement,  dated  30  May  2019,  and
         additional bank statements.

11. A word should be said about the new evidence. Clear directions were set
    out at the end of the error  of  law  decision  requiring  any  further
    evidence from either party to be submitted no later than 28 days before
    the resumed hearing. In fact, the new  evidence  was  received  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in two batches: the new bundle on 30 May 2019;  and  the
    remaining evidence on 31 May. We appreciate Mr Martin's point that  the
    notice of hearing was only issued on 13 May 2019, but that really  does
    not address  the  lateness  of  the  evidence.  The  Claimant  and  her
    representatives were on notice of the possibility of submitting further
    evidence  upon  receipt  of  the  error  of  law  decision  (which  was
    promulgated on 10 April 2019). Therefore, although the  period  between
    receipt of the notice of hearing and the  resumed  hearing  itself  was
    relatively short, it is difficult to  see  why  the  evidence  was  not
    submitted, or at least not collated ready for submission, at an earlier
    stage.

12. We have admitted the new evidence,  perhaps  generously  and  certainly
    having placed weight on the absence of any  objection  from  Mr  Tufan.
    However,  we  wish  to  make  it  clear  that  lateness  without   good
    explanation is going to prove a much greater obstacle in the way of the
    admission  of  further  evidence  in  the  future  and  the  Claimant's
    representatives (indeed all representatives) must take this on board.

13. The Sponsor attended the resumed hearing and gave oral evidence, a full
    note of which is contained in the record of proceedings. Having adopted
    her new witness statement, the Sponsor told us that she had not  wanted
    the Claimant to make a fresh application because it might take  a  long
    time to be decided. She accepted that the last  application  had  taken
    approximately three months for a decision. The Sponsor  confirmed  that
    her daughter attends school and has no additional needs.  We  are  told
    that the Sponsor and a daughter had visited Sri Lanka  three  times  in
    2018, twice in 2017, and on one occasion in the years 2016 and 2015.

Submissions

14. Mr Tufan submitted that the  Claimant  had  been  unable  to  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE in respect of the  application  made  to
    the Secretary of State. There was no specific challenge to any  of  the
    new evidence. Mr Tufan accepted that the Sponsor's earnings  remain  in
    excess of the minimum income requirement of  �18,600.  He  acknowledged
    that if a new application were made, it would be "likely  to  succeed".
    However, it was submitted that a  fresh  application  was  the  correct
    course to follow. We were referred to paras. 82 and 89  of  SS  (Congo)
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387. In the present case, it was said that  there  were
    no exceptional circumstances  relating  either  to  the  Claimant,  the
    Sponsor, or her daughter.

15. Mr Martin relied on the rule 24 response provided  in  advance  of  the
    error of law hearing. He submitted that even on the  evidence  provided
    with the original  application,  there  had  been  a  discretion  under
    GEN.3.1 of the Rules. Given the nature of the  Sponsor's  work  at  the
    time, which included  being  paid  in  cash,  it  could  be  said  that
    exceptional circumstances existed then. On this point, we were referred
    to  MM  (Lebanon)  [2017]  UKSC  10.  Mr  Martin  submitted  that   the
    combination of a number of factors disclosed  exceptional  features  in
    this case which meant that flexibility should be applied in respect  of
    the evidence needed to meet the financial  requirements.  The  features
    included the passage of time since the  original  application  and  the
    interests of the Sponsor's daughter.

16. Mr Martin then helpfully took us through the  new  evidence,  providing
    cross-references to show that, his submission, the Claimant  could  now
    satisfy all of the requirements set out in Appendix FM-SE. In light  of
    this, it was said that it  would  be  disproportionate  to  expect  the
    appellant to make a fresh application.

Findings of relevant facts

17. There is no material dispute as to  the  reliability  of  the  evidence
    before us. We find the Sponsor and the documents  provide  a  perfectly
    credible evidential platform. In light of this, we make  the  following
    findings of fact.

18. We, like the First-tier Tribunal, find that the Sponsor had  previously
    been earning in excess of the �18,600 threshold. At  the  time  of  the
    entry clearance application, we find that the Sponsor's  earnings  were
    derived from a combination of self-employment and employment  with  P2M
    Coffee. The evidence shows that  in  June  2018  the  Sponsor  took  on
    another job with  Coral  Bookmakers.  We  find  that  the  Sponsor  has
    continued with both employments to the present day.

19. With reference to the Sponsor's witness statement  and  the  employer's
    letter at page 4 of the new bundle,  we  find  that  she  is  currently
    working as a store manager with P2M Coffee.  Although  the  start  date
    given in the letter is 9 September 2016, the implication in para. 5  of
    the witness statement is that the store  manager  role  has  only  been
    taken on recently. In any event, we find that the gross  annual  salary
    is currently �18,720. The earnings from the Coral employment vary on  a
    month to month basis, as can be seen  from  the  payslips  in  the  new
    bundle: the highest figure is �143.66  (for  December  2018),  and  the
    lowest is �51.60 (for March 2019).

20. The payslips and bank statements to which we have been referred  by  Mr
    Martin clearly establish six months' worth  of  corresponding  earnings
    and deposits into the Sponsor's bank account, that period running  from
    November 2018 to April 2019. For ease of  reference,  we  set  out  the
    relevant page references within the new bundle and additional  evidence
    here:

         Payslip  Bank statement

         10 (30 November 2018)    33

         9 (31 December 2018)     27

         8 (31 January 2019) 24

         7 (28 February 2019)     21

           6  (31  March  2019)   Separate  statement  attached  to  witness
                                        statement

           5  (30  April  2019)   Separate  statement  attached  to  witness
                                        statement

21. In respect of the employer's letter, dated 23 May 2019, at page  4  the
    new bundle, we find that it contains all required information about the
    Sponsor's employment including her position, the annual  gross  salary,
    the length of her employment, and the nature of that employment.

22. We turn to the issue of the Sponsor's daughter. We find that she  is  a
    British citizen, currently in Year 9 of a secondary education. In light
    of the Sponsor's oral evidence,  we  find  that  the  daughter  has  no
    additional educational or health difficulties.  Helpfully,  we  have  a
    letter from the daughter at pages 2-3  of  the  new  bundle.  We  fully
    accept that she has a good relationship with the Claimant and sees  him
    as a father-figure. That relationship will have  been  maintained,  and
    even strengthened, by the fact (as we find it  to  be)  of  the  annual
    visits made by the Sponsor and her daughter to Sri Lanka since 2015. We
    fully accept that the daughter misses the Claimant  and  would  clearly
    like him to be with her and the Sponsor in the United Kingdom.

23. We find that the Sponsor does not have any health issues.

Conclusions

24. Beginning with a consideration of the relevant Rules, it  is  clear  to
    us, as it was to the First-tier Tribunal, that the Claimant was  unable
    to meet specific requirements of Appendix FM-SE. Primarily, this is  on
    the basis that the relevant bank statements did not show  the  earnings
    relied on being deposited. We would add that the employer's  letter  at
    page 96 of the Claimants original bundle does not state  the  Sponsor's
    gross annual salary, an omission which causes difficulties under  para.
    2(b)(i) of Appendix FM-SE.

25. Mr Martin has relied on the flexibility  inserted  into  the  Rules  by
    GEN.3.1, following MM (Lebanon). In our view, this provision  does  not
    assist the Claimant's case. First, this not a case in which alternative
    sources of income or financial support were being relied upon:  it  was
    the Sponsor's earnings, and those alone. Second, whilst  we  appreciate
    the practical realities of receiving wages in the form of cash,  we  do
    not regard that as constituting, in and of itself,  an  exceptional  or
    compelling basis requiring a departure from  the  mandatory  evidential
    requirements in order to avoid unjustifiably harsh consequences for the
    Claimant,  the  Sponsor,  or  her  daughter.  We  arrive  at  the  same
    conclusion when we take into account all of the additional factors  put
    forward by Mr Martin.

26. Therefore, this is a case in which it falls to us to  conduct  a  wider
    Article 8 assessment outside the context of the Rules.

27. It is quite clear that there is, and has been at  all  material  times,
    family life as between the Claimant and the Sponsor and, on  the  facts
    of this case, the Claimant his stepdaughter. The Secretary of State has
    never sought to argue the contrary.

28. The Secretary of State's decision constitutes  a  sufficiently  serious
    interference with (or to put it another way, a lack of respect for) the
    Claimant's family life.

29. The decision under appeal was clearly in accordance with  the  law  and
    made in pursuance of a legitimate aim.

30. The core issues therefore that of proportionality.

31.  The  best  interests  of  the  Sponsor's  daughter   are   a   primary
    consideration. She is clearly well-settled in the country of her  birth
    and residence. Whilst we fully appreciate the fact that she misses  the
    Claimant and would like the family unit to be reunited, there has  been
    no evidence to the effect that her separation  from  the  Claimant  has
    had, or is having, a materially negative impact on  her  overall  well-
    being. Notwithstanding this, we are prepared to accept  that  her  best
    interests do lie with  having  the  Claimant  in  the  United  Kingdom.
    However, those best interests are not of a particularly  strong  nature
    on the facts of this case.

32. We also take into  account  the  quite  understandable  fact  that  the
    Claimant misses his wife and vice versa. The has  now  been  a  lengthy
    separation of the couple, although we do bear in mind the fact that the
    Sponsor and her daughter have made regular trips back to Sri Lanka over
    the course of time.

33. The nub of this case relates to our findings on the Sponsor's  earnings
    and the evidence provided in support thereof. On  the  face  of  it,  a
    fresh application for entry clearance would be very likely to  succeed,
    an outcome recognised by Mr Tufan (although we acknowledge that he used
    the term "likely"). Would it be proportionate for the Claimant to  make
    such a fresh application? Or to  put  it  another  way,  would  such  a
    requirement be disproportionate?

34. On the particular facts of this case we conclude that it would  not  be
    disproportionate to require the Appellant to make a  fresh  application
    for entry clearance. Although  we  have  made  findings  of  fact  that
    clearly provide good  support  for  the  prospects  of  success  of  an
    application if one were to be made now, in our view it is not enough to
    say that this, without more, justifies circumvention  of  the  need  to
    pursue the appropriate channel provided by the Rules. It might be  that
    not very much more is required, but in this case there are no  features
    which can properly be categorised as strong, compelling, compassionate,
    or suchlike.

35. As we have  said  previously,  the  best  interests  of  the  Sponsor's
    daughter are not of a particularly strong nature. We  cannot  see  that
    any significant detriment would be caused to her by  the  making  of  a
    fresh application. There are no health issues relating to  any  of  the
    protagonists in this case. Whilst there has been a  lengthy  separation
    of the Claimant from his wife, regular visits have taken place  in  the
    interim. We bear in mind the costs of making a new application, but  in
    light of the Sponsor's earnings and the ability to have undertaken  the
    visits to Sri Lanka,  it  is  highly  likely  that  the  fees  are  not
    prohibitively high. In terms of any potential delay between the  making
    of a new application and a decision upon it, there was  nothing  unduly
    protracted about the process when the last  application  was  made  and
    there is no evidence  to  indicate  that  significant  delays  are  now
    occurring.

36. A final factor that we considered is the  worry  of  the  Claimant  and
    Sponsor that a fresh application may be refused, leading to potentially
    protracted appellate  proceedings  once  again.  We  cannot  of  course
    guarantee an outcome. Having said  that,  we  emphasise  the  following
    matters:

      a) There has never been any dispute about the  Claimant's  ability  to
         meet the provisions of Appendix FM,  save  for  the  issue  of  the
         financial requirements;

      b) Our findings on the Sponsor's earnings and the evidence provided in
         support thereof represent a clear judicial  statement  of  relevant
         facts.

37. It would be wholly unsurprising if a copy of our decision were included
    with any fresh application.

38. As matters stand, the Secretary of State's decision  was  proportionate
    and therefore lawful.

Anonymity

39. We make no anonymity order in this case.


Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law and it has been set aside.

We remake the decision by dismissing Mr Welhenagamage's appeal.

For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr S Martin of Counsel, instructed by Capital Legal
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is a challenge  by  the  Respondent  ("the  Secretary  of  State")
    against the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Easterman  (the
    judge), promulgated on 28 January 2019, in which he allowed the  appeal
    of Mr Welhenagamage ("the Claimant").  That appeal  had  in  turn  been
    against the decision of an Entry Clearance Officer,  dated  18  January
    2018, refusing to issue entry clearance to the  Claimant  in  order  to
    join his wife in the United Kingdom.  The sole basis  for  refusal  was
    the conclusion that the Claimant  had  failed  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules ("the Rules") with
    particular reference to the specified evidence required under  Appendix
    FM-SE.

The judge's decision

 2. The Judge identified the core issue in the appeal at [16], noting  that
    the whole case turned on whether  or  not  the  Claimant's  wife  ("the
    Sponsor") could show that she was earning, in the  manner  required  by
    the Rules, enough to meet the minimum income threshold of �18,600.

 3. On the basis of the evidence before him the judge  concluded  that  the
    Sponsor was indeed earning in excess  of  that  threshold  (the  figure
    being over �20,000 per annum).  He found that  much  of  the  Sponsor's
    income was paid to her in cash and  that  she  had  not  in  fact  been
    depositing all of her wages into her bank account, but had instead kept
    some back for day-to-day expenses.  In light of this, at [34] the judge
    concluded that the Sponsor (and in turn the Claimant) had  been  unable
    to satisfy all of the specific evidential requirements  under  Appendix
    FM-SE.

 4. The judge then turned his attention to a wider  Article  8  assessment.
    He took into account the fact  that  the  Sponsor  met  the  "financial
    requirements of the Secretary of State" and the existence of "protected
    family  life"  because  of  the  Sponsor's  daughter  (the   Claimant's
    stepdaughter).  The ultimate conclusion was that  the  refusal  of  the
    entry clearance application (which had  constituted  the  human  rights
    claim) was disproportionate.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

 5. The grounds are succinct.  They assert that the judge  had  effectively
    allowed the appeal on the basis of a  "near-miss"  argument,  something
    that was, in light of the relevant law, impermissible.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyes  on
    19 February 2019.

The hearing before me

 7. For the Secretary of State, Mr Whitwell provided  a  skeleton  argument
    relied on it in combination with the grounds of appeal.

 8. Mr Martin relied on his rule 24 response and submitted that  the  judge
    had not in fact relied on a "near-miss" argument, but rather had simply
    applied flexibility to the issue of the relevant  financial  threshold.
    He cited the judgment of the Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) [2017]  UKSC
    10 and the changes brought about to Appendix FM-SE by the  introduction
    of GEN.3.1 of the Rules.  On an overall picture  of  the  evidence,  Mr
    Martin submitted that the judge had been entitled to allow  the  appeal
    with reference to the financial  issue.   It  was  submitted  that  the
    existence of the child was not  necessary  for  the  Claimant  to  have
    succeeded, although there had been a good deal of  underlying  evidence
    before the judge.

 9. In reply, Mr Whitwell emphasised the fact that the  Claimant  had  been
    unable to satisfy the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  This was  not  a
    case in which third party support had been relied on: it was simply the
    Sponsor's income.  The judge had failed to take  any  or  any  adequate
    regard of the failure to meet the Rules when assessing proportionality.
     In addition Mr Whitwell submitted that there were simply no reasons in
    respect of the evidence relating to the relevant child.

Decision on error of law

10. I conclude that there are two errors in the judge's decision,  both  of
    which are material to the outcome.

11. It  is  well-settled  that  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  are
    mandatory in nature and substantive insofar as an application under the
    Rules is concerned.  It is also the case that a failure to satisfy  the
    relevant Rules is a factor which  should  be  attributed  "appropriate"
    weight in the Secretary of State's favour  (see  for  example  [57]  of
    Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11).

12. Once the judge had concluded that the Claimant could  not  satisfy  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE, it was in my view incumbent upon him to
    factor this in on an express basis as being a  matter  adverse  to  the
    Claimant's Article 8 case outside the context of the Rules.  It is  not
    to say that the inability to meet all of  the  evidential  requirements
    under the Appendix  is  necessarily  fatal  to  such  a  claim:  it  is
    nonetheless clearly a relevant factor.

13. With respect to the judge, I cannot see anything in [36]  and  [37]  to
    indicate that he has specifically addressed his mind to the  Claimant's
    failure to meet the Rules in the manner required by the  case  law.   I
    note that he states  in  [36]  that  the  Sponsor  met  "the  financial
    requirements of the Secretary of State", but that was not the case: the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE had not been met.  This is an indication
    that the significance of the Claimant's failure had not been adequately
    factored in to the overall balancing exercise.

14. I take on board Mr Martin's point  about  flexibility,  and  it  is  of
    course a case that the strict requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  are  not
    necessarily the last word.  However, none of the provisions cited by Mr
    Martin in his rule 24 response were addressed (in form or substance) by
    the judge and, importantly, he has in any event failed to factor in the
    impact of the failure to meet the Rules.

15. In respect of the Sponsor's daughter, it is difficult to see  that  she
    did not play a material part in the judge's overall consideration.  Her
    presence is mentioned in [36] and [37].   These  passages  contain  the
    substance of the judge's wider Article 8 assessment.  I  conclude  that
    it is unrealistic to try and excise this  particular  factor  from  the
    judge's overall considerations.  Whatever the underlying  evidence  may
    have been in respect of the child, there is simply no assessment of it,
    and no reasoned findings or conclusions thereon.   In  my  view  it  is
    impossible to simply assume that  all  the  evidence  was  weighed  up,
    accepted, and that relevant conclusions were drawn on it  in  light  of
    the applicable legal framework.

16. In light of the above the judge's decision must be set aside.

Disposal

17. Initially it was my view and that of both representatives that I should
    remake the decision in this appeal based upon the evidence  now  before
    me.  However, having taken further instructions, Mr Martin informed  me
    that there was additional evidence relating to the Sponsor's income and
    the circumstances of her daughter.

18. Although it should be said that such evidence  could  and  should  have
    been adduced in  preparation  for  the  error  of  law  hearing,  I  am
    satisfied that it would be appropriate in  this  case  to  adjourn  the
    appeal for a resumed hearing before me in due course.  In  so  doing  I
    expressly preserve the judge's finding of fact that the Sponsor was (at
    least in respect of the  date  of  hearing  before  him)  earning  over
    �20,000 a year.

19. In order to progress this matter I issue  directions  to  the  parties,
    below.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains material errors of law  and
I set it aside.
