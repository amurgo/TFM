                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction

    1. The appellants are citizens of Afghanistan: the first  appellant  is
       the mother of the second, third and fourth appellants.  Their  dates
       of birth are 1962, 2003, 1998 and 1999 respectively. They reside  in
       Pakistan with no lawful status having fled from  the  Taliban  after
       the killing of the first appellant's husband/ father of the  second,
       third  and  fourth  appellants,  who  was  a  district  governor  in
       Afghanistan. They have applied to come to the UK  to  join  OD,  the
       sponsor, who is the son of the first appellant and  sibling  of  the
       other appellants. He was granted refugee status and five years leave
       to remain on 26th June 2014,  and  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in
       October 2019. AGD, brother of the sponsor, also a son of  the  first
       appellant and sibling of the other appellants,  also  had  leave  to
       remain in the UK as a  recognised  refugee  and  now  is  a  British
       citizen who supports the application of the appellants. DNA evidence
       has shown that the relationships  between  the  appellants  and  the
       sponsor, OD, is as claimed.

    2. The appellants applied for entry clearance to join the sponsor,  and
       were refused in a decision dated 15th November  2018.  At  the  same
       time OD's wife and four children applied to join him. They were also
       refused, but when DNA evidence showed  that  they  were  related  as
       claimed they were granted entry clearance and joined him in the  UK.
       The  appeal  of  these  appellants  against  the  refusal  of  entry
       clearance to join OD was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Meah, but there was an appeal to the Upper Tribunal and the decision
       of Judge Meah was set aside and remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
       for remaking, with no findings preserved. The appeal was remade  and
       again dismissed, this time  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Andonian,  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  13th  September   2019.
       Permission to appeal was granted, and a Panel found that the  First-
       tier Tribunal had erred in law for the reasons set out at Annex A to
       this decision.

    3. The matter comes before me now to remake the appeal. The hearing was
       held via a remote Skype for Business hearing in light of the need to
       reduce the transmission of the Covid-19 virus, and in light of  this
       being found to be acceptable by both parties, and being a  means  by
       which the appeal could be fairly and justly determined.  There  were
       no significant issues of audibility or connectivity in the  hearing.



    4. Mr Jesurum for the appellant accepted at the error  of  law  hearing
       that there is no  challenge  to  the  dismissal  of  the  appeal  by
       reference to the Immigration Rules at paragraph 319, and  the  Panel
       found that there  was  no  error  in  this  decision-making  so  the
       remaking of the appeal focuses  solely  on  the  appeal  considering
       Article 8 ECHR outside of those Rules. The bundles were served  late
       so the hearing was adjourned by two hours to give Mr Walker time  to
       read them. He confirmed that he was  ready  to  proceed  after  this
       time.

Evidence & Submissions - Remaking

    5. The appellants called the  following  witnesses  to  give  evidence.
       Their key evidence from their written statements and  oral  evidence
       is,  in  short  summary,  as  follows.  They  all  confirmed   their
       identities, addresses  and  that  their  statements  were  true  and
       correct to the best of their belief, and their evidence to the Upper
       Tribunal in support of this appeal

    6. OD, settled refugee living in the UK, is the  principal  sponsor  of
       the appellants. He came to the UK and  was  granted  refugee  status
       without an appeal by the respondent in  June  2014.  He  joined  his
       younger brother, AGD, who had come to the UK as a minor in 2006, and
       who is now a British citizen and married with two children. OD works
       as a taxi driver. He is married with five children.  The  appellants
       are his mother and three younger siblings, the youngest of  whom  is
       AD who is now just 18 years  old,  his  sisters,  AMD  and  RD,  are
       unmarried young adults aged 23 and 22 years old respectively.

    7. In October 2006 OD's father was assassinated by the Taliban, and  in
       October 2007 OD fled Afghanistan with the appellants and his wife to
       a place near Peshawar in Pakistan. OD  became  head  of  the  family
       following his father's death and took on responsibility for the care
       of the appellants. In Afghanistan he had been living with his  wife,
       whom he married in April 2006, and the  appellants  as  part  of  an
       extended household.

    8. In Pakistan the appellants, OD, his wife  and  their  children  were
       accommodated by HZG in  the  village  of  Ikramullah  Khan,  in  the
       Karkhano district about  two  hours  from  Peshawar.  When  OD  left
       Pakistan HZG had given the appellants two rooms in  his  house,  but
       this was not supposed to be a long- term arrangement.  HZG  expected
       OD to take care of his own family, as head  of  the  household,  and
       obtain visas for them to join him in the  UK  when  he  got  refugee
       status there in 2014. HZG helped in this way as he was a good person
       and friend of OD's father and understood their plight. In the  past,
       after OD came to the UK, messages from the appellants  were  got  to
       him via HZG when he went to the city of Peshawar  as  telephone  and
       internet reception were poor in the village  where  they  lived.  OD
       currently has no way of direct contact with the appellants and  just
       has information about the appellants through people  who  travel  to
       Pakistan from the UK: in recent times news has been brought by Dr  H
       who is an Afghan refugee and WM who is a  student  in  the  UK  from
       Afghanistan but who is normally resident in Pakistan.

    9. OD has supported the appellants financially in Pakistan  by  sending
       money to people who agree to accept it on their  behalf  and  taking
       larger amounts when he has travelled. He cannot send it directly  to
       the appellants as they have no status in Pakistan, he  has  provided
       evidence of five recent money transfers of  approximately  �50  each
       via Western Union to a number of trusted individuals in  the  period
       October 2020 to February 2021. He has also recently sent  �400  with
       Dr H and �400 with Mr J. Sometimes  his  brother,  AGD,  also  sends
       money.

   10. From 2017 HZG wanted the appellants to leave his home. HZG asked  OD
       formally in letters dated March and September  2018  to  remove  the
       appellants from his home. In July 2019 HZG had a stroke  and  became
       bedridden. HZG died on 24th February 2020 and his brother JG  became
       aggressive to the appellants, blaming them for adding stress to  HZG
       and causing his death, and demanding that they  leave  HZG's  house.
       The appellants now live in an animal shelter, which is  provided  to
       them by the uncle of their friend WM. It is  not  properly  fit  for
       human habitation and has no water supply or electricity.

   11. The appellants also have problems due to the operation of  terrorist
       groups in the area, and as a result AD has not been able  to  attend
       school and has been deprived of  an  education.  OD  has  been  AD's
       father figure since he was  four  years  old,  when  his  biological
       father died, and has been brought up with OD's own children  in  one
       family unit. OD has maintained his family ties to all the appellants
       via yearly visits in the period 2014 to 2017 after  getting  refugee
       status in the UK. AD has  medical  problems  which  cause  dangerous
       bleeding, and this is a concern to OD. In the past AD has only  been
       able to access hospital in the past with the help of  HZG,  although
       even then the police tried  to  stop  them  as  they  did  not  have
       documentation. OD is also concerned that  AD  has  become  depressed
       since his wife and children left  Afghanistan,  something  that  HZG
       told him before he died. OD's children and wife are also affected by
       the  break-up  of  their  family,  with  the  appellants   left   in
       Afghanistan, and his eldest son  has  written  a  letter  about  his
       distress. OD understands the first appellant, his  mother,  is  also
       depressed, has heart problems and high blood pressures, she has lost
       weight and was recently in hospital with Covid-19.

   12. OD is also worried that the Pakistani authorities  will  deport  the
       appellants to Afghanistan  despite  their  being  refugees  with  no
       regard to  whether  they  are  at  risk  in  that  country.  If  the
       appellants returned to their village in Shamspoor in the district of
       Surkhroud, Nangahar they would be at risk from  insurgents  and  the
       Taliban, particularly as they  would  be  without  a  male  head  of
       family. OD  is  afraid  his  siblings  would  be  sexual  abused  by
       militants and his sisters forced into marriage. OD  is  not  a  rich
       man, and also could not afford to support the appellants properly in
       Afghanistan.

   13. OD did not apply for entry clearance  for  the  whole  family  until
       February 2018 as he was advised he was only entitled  to  bring  his
       wife and children, and not his mother and siblings, and did not want
       to split up the family. The appellants and  his  wife  and  children
       have lived all of their lives as a joint family from  the  point  of
       his marriage in Afghanistan until his wife and children travelled to
       the UK, following their grant of entry clearance, in February  2019.
       He applied for the whole family to come to the UK when he  had  some
       ability to provide support and accommodation in  the  UK  and  at  a
       point when  HZG  was  asking  more  insistently  that  he  move  the
       appellants out of his accommodation. OD cannot return to Afghanistan
       as he is a refugee, and cannot live in Pakistan with the  appellants
       as he has no right to reside there, and like the appellants would be
       vulnerable to removal to  Afghanistan,  and  without  any  means  to
       support himself and the appellants.

   14. OD says if the appellants were allowed to come to the  UK  he  would
       now be able to accommodate them: he now has  a  three  bedroom  flat
       with two reception rooms: his children are all young and they  would
       have sufficient space. He has also  produced  evidence  dated  April
       2021 that if they were to join him that the property  would  not  be
       statutorily overcrowded from  McLaren  Environmental  Services  Ltd,
       which is at page  112  of  the  consolidated  bundle.  Further,  his
       brother AGD could also provide accommodation to his sisters if  need
       be as he has a three bedroom  property,  and  sufficient  space.  OD
       could also support his family including  the  appellants  using  his
       income from work, universal credit and child benefit, and savings of
       �2000. He also believes that his appellant siblings would be able to
       get work within the Afghani/Pakistani community. He has  obtained  a
       written offer of work dated April 2021 for the second appellant, AD,
       from Pizza GoGo, as a kitchen assistant working  full  time  on  the
       minimum wage, along with evidence of the existence of  this  company
       and witness statements from the manager and from the owner; and also
       letters offering unskilled work to the third and  fourth  appellants
       from Fresh Market, also dated April 2021,  along  with  evidence  of
       that company existing and witness statement from the owner.

   15. AGD is the son of the first appellant and  sibling  of  the  second,
       third and fourth  appellants,  and  brother  of  OD,  the  principal
       sponsor. He is a British citizen, who  was  granted  refugee  status
       when the came to the UK, and lives in the UK with his wife and three
       young children. He is happy to accommodate his sisters or mother  in
       his two bedroom property with sitting room if they are permitted  to
       come to the UK, as he, his wife and his  three  young  children  all
       sleep in one room. He works as a black cab driver,  and  has  income
       from this work, a government Covid  grant,  tax  credits  and  child
       benefit. He confirms that people within his community  will  provide
       simple packing and cleaning jobs for his appellant siblings if  they
       are permitted to come to the UK.

   16. He confirms that OD's delay in applying  for  entry  clearance  from
       2014 to 2018 was caused by the fact he was told he could  not  bring
       the appellants. He confirms he has provided some  financial  support
       to the appellants over the years, and that OD, his  family  and  the
       appellants lived as one family. OD kept in touch with the appellants
       after he obtained refugee  status  in  the  UK  by  visits  for  the
       following periods: September 2014 to December 2014,  September  2015
       to December 2015, September 2016 to December 2016,  August  2017  to
       November 2017, October 2018 to November 2018.  He confirms that  HZG
       ran out of patience providing the appellants with accommodation, and
       demanded that OD remove them from his home. AGD  last  travelled  to
       Pakistan in November/December 2016 to see the appellants  and  found
       that the place was insecure, and he  himself  was  threated  by  the
       Pakistani army even though he had documents.  His  younger  brother,
       AD, has  not  had  schooling  there  because  of  the  dangers  from
       insurgents and risks of him being  brain  washed  by  fanatics.  The
       appellants situation is now even worse as they have been thrown  out
       of their accommodation with HZG after his death by  his  family  and
       live in a place not fit for human habitation. It would not  be  safe
       for the appellants to return to Afghanistan as the family would have
       no male protector and the Taliban continue to pose a threat in their
       home area. It is very worrying that currently they do not even  have
       phone contact with  the  appellants.  AGD  gave  evidence  that  the
       separation from the appellants weighs heavily on  his  brother,  OD,
       who is under a lot of pressure and stress as he  is  responsible  as
       the head of the family and father-figure to AD.

   17. Dr H is a citizen of Afghanistan, recognised refugee  and  qualified
       medical doctor working as a lecturer in international public  health
       at City University. In Afghanistan he  worked  as  a  senior  public
       relations adviser in government, and also  in  a  very  senior  role
       managing the health service with some 5000 staff beneath him. He has
       a Master's degree in global health from University  College  London.
       He came to the UK in May 2018 and was recognised  as  a  refugee  in
       March 2019 by the respondent without having to attend  a  court.  He
       remembers that he met OD in 2005 when OD's father was  the  district
       governor of his area, and he knew OD's father  from  when  he  would
       visit him with his father as a child. OD's father was  a  very  good
       friend of his, and he knows that the  appellants  and  their  family
       lived well in Afghanistan before his death. After  OD's  father  was
       killed  in  an  explosion  caused  by  terrorists  he  has  felt  an
       obligation to look out for the family in memory of his friend.

   18. Dr H explains that OD asked him to go and see the appellants when he
       travelled to Pakistan in March 2020, and gave him �400  to  take  to
       the appellants. He was in Pakistan between March and June  2020.  He
       was deeply affected by his visit to the appellants. He had travelled
       to Pakistan to see his father who was ill  in  a  coma  in  hospital
       there, but before going to  see  his  father  he  went  to  see  the
       appellants and found that  their  situation  was  terrible.  He  was
       shocked to see them live like that, in a way that he  had  not  seen
       people live before. He  found  them  living  in  a  remote  part  of
       Peshawar in distressing and depressing circumstances  compared  even
       to normal life in war torn Afghanistan. There was no electricity and
       no potable water. The first appellant told him that they lived there
       to avoid detection as they had no papers to live  in  Pakistan.  The
       place was a donkey shelter used  by  nomads  which  smelt  badly  of
       donkey dung. The second appellant, AD, was confined  in  this  place
       due to the threat of his being taken by insurgents,  and  Dr  H  was
       concerned for his health. AD was bleeding from the back passage  due
       to haemorrhoids, having been operated on  by  an  unqualified  local
       healer. Dr H fears that AD is  at  risk  of  infection  due  to  the
       unhygienic circumstances he is  living  in  and  his  problems  with
       bleeding. He believes that the appellants are vulnerable due to  the
       insurgents who are active in the area and the fact that they have no
       male protector since the illness/ death of HZG. The first  appellant
       is also depressed. He believes that they should be permitted to come
       to the UK.

   19. WM is a citizen of Afghanistan and dependent of a recognised  Afghan
       refugee who went to Pakistan 40 years ago. WM is currently  studying
       for Master's degree in data science at the University of  Essex.  He
       came to the UK in March 2021 and  has  permission  to  remain  as  a
       student until February 2022. He has known OD for  about  ten  years,
       and thus got to know him in Pakistan before he travelled to  the  UK
       and obtained asylum.

   20. WM is aware that the appellants were  helped  by  HZG  when  he  was
       alive, and he believes that HZG did an honourable thing to take them
       on and provide for them, especially  as  he  had  to  protect  three
       women. However, HZG wanted OD to take  over  the  task,  and  things
       became very difficult when HZG got sick. HZG died, having  been  ill
       for some time, in February 2020. HZG's brother JG believes that  the
       stress of caring for the appellants led to HZG's death and  is  very
       angry about them having lived with him, and when asked by WM said he
       did not have HZG's death certificate but would refuse to give it  to
       OD even if he had it. As JG was so cruel and  angry  the  appellants
       had to leave HZG's home.

   21. OD asked WM for help getting the  appellants  a  place  to  live  in
       Pakistan but it was very difficult as they have no status there, and
       so have no right to live there, work or have  a  bank  account,  and
       further they cannot seek help from the police or use  the  hospital.
       It is also not possible for  them  to  have  a  mobile  phone  as  a
       Pakistani ID card is needed to buy a SIM card in  Pakistan.  No  one
       wanted to help  them  with  accommodation,  and  it  was  only  with
       difficulty that he persuaded an uncle to allow them to use a shelter
       he had used for his animals. This place  is  very  remote,  about  2
       hours  from  Karkhano.  There  is  no  kitchen,  running  water   or
       electricity,  and  the  water  they  drink  is  not  fit  for  human
       consumption. There are no actual doors or windows in the  structure,
       just holes.  The  appellants  are  all  depressed,  and  the  second
       appellant has problems with bleeding from  haemorrhoids  which  were
       treated by an unqualified doctor. It is also insecure as  there  are
       lots of insurgents in the area, and these pose a particular risk  to
       the second appellant. WM is aware that OD sends money to support the
       appellants: WM has taken money to them himself and so has Dr  H.  He
       is aware of Dr H's visit to the appellants as he gave him directions
       to find the shelter where they live. However,  money  can  only  buy
       food and not a proper life for the appellants in Pakistan.

   22. NK is a British citizen of Afghan origin who came to the UK in 2010.
       He had permission  to  remain  on  humanitarian  protection  grounds
       originally. AGD is his best friend in the UK, who helped him when he
       had severe mental health problems, and so out of friendship he makes
       the offer of employment as a kitchen porter to the second appellant,
       AD. He is the manager of the business PizzaGoGo and is in a position
       to make the offer. It is a genuine offer of employment and  the  job
       genuinely exists.

   23. There are also written statements from two further  people  who  did
       not attend the Upper Tribunal to give evidence. Firstly, Mr  FF  who
       is a British citizen of Afghan origins and who has lived in  the  UK
       since 1998. He knew AGD and OD's father  and  feels  sorry  for  the
       appellants and wants to help the family. He owns a  supermarket,  TW
       Fresh Market Limited, and is able to  offer  cleaning  jobs  to  the
       third and fourth  appellants,  and  confirms  that  the  offers  are
       genuine and that the job  genuinely  exists.  Secondly,  Mr  RS  who
       confirms that he is the owner and director of PizzaGoGo and confirms
       that he supports the job offer made by NK, and that  he  is  also  a
       friend of AGD.

   24. The original expert report  of  Dr  Giustozzi,  renowned  expert  on
       Afghanistan, for these  appellants  is  dated  7th  March  2018.  Dr
       Giustozzi sets out his experience and publications, and confirms his
       overriding duty to the court. He states that the appellants would be
       at risk of attack from the Taliban if they were to resettle in areas
       where the Taliban is active such as their home  area  of  Nangarhar,
       and that the police would not be able to protect the  appellants  if
       they were to return.  With respect to Pakistan Dr Giustozzi confirms
       that the Pakistani  authorities  have  increasingly  been  harassing
       Afghans living on their territory. From around  1999  the  Pakistani
       authorities were restricting the admission of new refugees  and  the
       majority of refugees were not properly registered with UNHCR due  to
       the  behaviour  of  the  Pakistani  police.  In  April  2006   UNHCR
       deregistered all Afghan refugees  on  Pakistani  territory,  however
       Afghans continued to enter Pakistan with the result that  there  are
       large numbers of unregistered Afghan refugees  in  Pakistan.  It  is
       therefore plausible that the appellants have lived in Pakistan since
       2007 without  being  registered.  It  is  also  the  case  that  the
       appellants could be deported from Pakistani for being there  without
       documentation, that there are increasingly  frequent  crackdowns  on
       Afghans  living  illegally  in  Pakistan,  and  that  the  Pakistani
       government does not accept any new Afghan refugees so  there  is  no
       possibility of obtained refugee visas to lawfully remain  there.  It
       is also very difficult for a woman to rent a property as in 2011 the
       Peshawar district administration issued an order barring the renting
       of accommodation to women living alone. Dr Giustozzi confirms in his
       updating email of 29th April 2021 that the dangers for the family in
       Pakistan remain the same and that the risk in Afghanistan  from  the
       Taliban in the form of targeted killings  has  increased  since  the
       autumn of 2020.

   25. The respondent reasons for refusal in the  entry  clearance  refusal
       notices are that the appellants do not have  family  life  with  the
       sponsor  OD,  and  that  any  interference  with  a   private   life
       relationship with OD and AGD is proportionate as  they  resided  for
       four years apart from the time OD gained refugee status  in  the  UK
       and  there  is  insufficient  evidence  of  their  circumstances  in
       Pakistan to find that the refusal to  issue  entry  clearance  is  a
       disproportionate interference with their Article 8 ECHR  rights.  Mr
       Walker said he had no instructions to concede the appeal but it  was
       accepted for the respondent that  the  appellants  were  related  as
       claimed due to the DNA evidence; and further he accepted that  there
       was now credible evidence about  there  being  sufficient  financial
       support and accommodation in the UK for the  appellants,  and  about
       the  appellants'  living  circumstances  in  Pakistan.   Mr   Walker
       submitted that I should make a decision on the evidence  before  me.



   26. It is argued by Mr Jesurum in oral submissions and in  his  skeleton
       argument, in short summary, as follows.

   27. It is submitted firstly that the appellants and sponsor  have  real,
       effective and committed family life, and that there  are  more  than
       normal emotional bonds between them. It is clear from  the  evidence
       that they formed a household prior to the sponsor's entry to the UK,
       indeed that this existed from birth for OA  and  the  appellants  as
       they had spent their whole lives together, first in Afghanistan  and
       then in Pakistan, until he was forced to flee to the UK as a refugee
       in 2014. It is argued that family life continues in light  of  their
       past cohabitation; in light of the fact that OA remains head of  the
       household with his sibling appellants being unmarried  young  adults
       and his mother a widow and he having taken on the role of father  to
       the second appellant from the age of four years; as a result of  the
       regular financial support provided by OA; and as a  result  of  OA's
       regular and lengthy visits to  Pakistan  prior  to  Covid-19  making
       these impossible. The only element missing at present is contact but
       it is argued that this is  reflective  of  the  appellants'  current
       desperate circumstances, which mean that visits  and  phone  contact
       are impossible due to the  pandemic  and  the  fact  the  appellants
       cannot buy a phone SIM without a  Pakistani  ID  card  and  have  no
       electricity to charge a phone  in  any  case.  Lack  of  contact  is
       therefore not due to a  lack  of  a  bond  between  them  but  their
       circumstances.

   28.  It  is  argued  secondly  that  refusing  entry  clearance  to  the
       appellants is a disproportionate interference with  their  right  to
       respect for family life.

   29. It is argued that there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life
       being reconstituted elsewhere because they cannot reconstitute their
       family life in Afghanistan because  OD  is  a  refugee  who  has  an
       ongoing well founded fear of persecution in that country,  reflected
       in the decision of Judge Metzer with respect  to  AGD;  and  further
       they cannot have family life in Pakistan because he and  they  would
       be/are at risk of refoulement and without any  status  or  right  to
       live there.

   30. Reliance is placed on material evidence,  particularly  the  witness
       evidence from OD, Dr H, WM, AGD, the medical evidence,  the  country
       expert report from  Dr  Antonio  Giustozzi  and  country  of  origin
       reports from Human Rights Watch which supports the contentions  that
       the appellants would be at real risk of serious harm in Afghanistan,
       and that they are at real risk  of  expulsion  to  serious  harm  in
       Afghanistan by the Pakistan authorities and living in  unduly  harsh
       circumstance in Pakistan. In Pakistan the appellants are  living  in
       terrible poverty without the basics of  a  private  life.  They  are
       undocumented  and  therefore  facing  difficulties  accessing  basic
       services and moving around in  Pakistan  with  being  harassed,  and
       lived in fear of arrest and deportation to  Afghanistan  where  they
       would be at real risk of serious harm. The  situation  in  Pakistan,
       and lack of  option  to  return  to  their  country  of  nationality
       Afghanistan, is therefore highly material to the proportionality  of
       the decisions under Article 8 ECHR.

   31. In addition, it is argued that the  best  interests  of  the  second
       appellant, AD, who although no longer a child is only just  18  year
       old and has had a deprived childhood, being uneducated  and  unwell,
       and thus should be afford the protections given  to  children  as  a
       very young adult, are also  highly  material  when  considering  the
       proportionality of the  decision  to  refuse  entry  clearance.  His
       medical  difficulties,  his  lack  of  access   to   education   and
       employment, the risk of ill-treatment, refoulement, and  restriction
       on his movements in Pakistan due to his lack of  status  there,  and
       the precariousness and poverty of his accommodation  all  auger  for
       his being allowed to join the sponsor, OA, in the UK. It  is  argued
       that  the  sponsor  stepped  in  as  AD's  father  figure  when  his
       biological father was murdered in Afghanistan when he was just  four
       years old, and thus in all of the circumstances it is  also  plainly
       in his best interests to be with the father figure who raised him.

   32. It  is  also  submitted  that  the  family  reunion  policy  of  the
       respondent gives examples where exceptionally broader family reunion
       should be allowed in accordance with Article 8  ECHR,  and  although
       the examples are not similar to the facts of this case,  that  there
       are compelling and exceptional compassionate features  of  the  same
       gravity in this case. It is argued that the medical difficulties  of
       the first and second appellants, and the desperate poverty in  which
       the appellants currently find themselves, which shocked Dr H who  is
       a family friend but also a qualified public health professional  who
       had held a senior position in the Afghan health service,  mean  that
       refusal of entry clearance would be disproportionate  in  accordance
       with the  policy  of  the  respondent  for  grants  outside  of  the
       Immigration Rules.

   33. It is acknowledged, having regard  to  s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, that weight must be  given  against
       the appellants due to their inability to speak English. However  the
       credible evidence of the job offers for the second, third and fourth
       appellants  and  earnings  of  OA  and  AGD  and  their   sufficient
       accommodation means that it should be accepted that they  would  not
       financially reliant upon the state,  and  so  would  be  financially
       independent of taxpayer. This is therefore a neutral matter.

   34. It is argued that although weight must be given to the fact that the
       appellants cannot  meet  the  requirements  of  the  refugee  family
       reunion Immigration Rules, and their inability to speak English  the
       weight of the other factors: the genuine family life  bonds  between
       members of a pre-flight refugee family;  the  fact  of  there  being
       insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life   anywhere   else;   the
       precarious circumstances and absolute poverty in which they live  in
       Pakistan; and their inability to return to Afghanistan due to a well
       founded fear of persecution means that the appeal should be  allowed
       as ultimately the refusal of entry clearance is  a  disproportionate
       interference with their right ot respect to family life.

   35. At the end of hearing I indicated that I would allow the  appeal  on
       Article 8 ECHR grounds, but I did not give an oral judgement.

   Conclusions - Remaking

   36. Mr Walker conceded that the evidence in this appeal is  credible.  I
       find that the witness evidence and documentary evidence  before  me,
       which was very detailed, heartfelt and consistent, is  reliable  and
       thus evidence on which weight can be placed.

   37. The first issue to determine is whether the  sponsor,  OD,  and  the
       appellants have an Article 8(1) ECHR family life relationship.  They
       are all adults and  this  must  therefore  be  a  relationship  that
       amounts to real, effective or committed support, and thus  something
       more than normal emotional ties, as per the tests in Rai v ECO Delhi
       [2017] EWCA Civ 320 per Lindblom LJ  at  paragraphs  17,  36-37  and
       Kugathas v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31 per Aden LJ at paragraph 25.

   38. I find that there is  a  family  life  relationship,  showing  real,
       effective and committed support,  for  the  following  reasons.  The
       sponsor, OD, and his wife,  after  marriage,  lived  together  as  a
       family  with  the  appellants  in  their  country   of   origin   in
       Afghanistan. They then fled together to find safety  Pakistan  after
       the death of OD's, and the  second,  third  and  fourth  appellants'
       father and first appellant's husband at the hands  of  the  Taliban.
       They then lived together in Pakistan with his  father's  friend  HZG
       for seven years until the sponsor left to claim asylum  in  the  UK,
       with OD's wife and children remaining  with  the  appellants  for  a
       further five years, until they joined OD in the UK in February 2019.
       There are therefore very many years of cohabitation for OD, his wife
       and children and the appellants  and  I  find  that  they  perceived
       themselves as one family, with OD as the head of that  family  after
       his father's death. I accept the evidence that he was  viewed  as  a
       father figure by the second appellant, and is missed as such, having
       brought him up from the age of four years, and the evidence that  he
       has continued to be the  person  responsible  for  keeping  everyone
       safely housed and financially supported after they fled to Pakistan.

   39. Although OD left Pakistan to claim asylum in 2014 he returned, after
       obtaining refugee status in the UK, for substantial visits of  three
       months to the appellants in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. He also  kept
       in touch whilst HZG was alive and  well  by  sending  and  receiving
       messages through him. OD has also sent regular financial support via
       people travelling or when he travelled, and to  trusted  people  via
       Western Union, to pay for food and  other  living  expenses.  OD  is
       clearly deeply troubled and saddened by his failure to  reunite  the
       appellants with himself, his wife and children in the UK,  from  his
       own evidence and that of the other witnesses. The appellants have no
       other family of their own, in the sense that the first appellant  is
       a widow, and the second, third and fourth appellants  are  all  very
       young adults who have not formed  separate  family  units  or  lived
       independently. I find that OD has  shown  long-term  real  committed
       support, both  in  the  sense  of  shouldering  responsibility,  for
       instance sorting  out  the  current  accommodation  when  it  became
       impossible for them to remain in the house of HZG  after  his  death
       due to the hostility of JG, and in  providing  financially  for  the
       appellants by taking money when he  travelled,  sending  it  through
       friends when they travelled and  transferring  smaller  amounts  via
       Western Union; and that his relationship  goes  a  long  way  beyond
       normal emotional ties of an adult son with his mother and  siblings,
       particularly in relation to the second appellant with whom I  accept
       he has father/son type  relationship.  Whilst  OD  cannot  currently
       visit or have phone contact with the appellants this is due  to  the
       pandemic and their accommodation being  without  electricity/  phone
       SIM cards not being available without a Pakistani  ID  card,  and  I
       find this, as Mr Jeserum has submitted, is not reflective  of  there
       being no family bond between them.

   40. I must now go on to consider  whether  the  interference  with  that
       family life which refusal  of  entry  clearance  to  the  appellants
       represents is disproportionate in all of the circumstances.

   41. As accepted by Mr Jeserum there are matters which weigh against  the
       appellants.  They  are  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
       Immigration Rules for refugee family reunion, and there is a  public
       interest in the maintenance of immigration control and  the  refusal
       of those who cannot meet those Immigration Rules, applying s.117B(1)
       of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. In addition, it
       weighs against  the  appellants  that  they  cannot  speak  English,
       applying s.117B(2) of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002.

   42. I find that it is a neutral matter  that  the  appellants  would  be
       financially independent of the taxpayer, applying s.117B(3)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  This  is  because   I
       find, as was accepted by Mr Walker for the respondent, that they can
       be accommodated without  recourse  to  public  funds  as  they  have
       provided credible evidence that their living with OD would not  make
       his new flat statutorily overcrowded, and in light of the fact  that
       AGD is also willing to provide accommodation too. I also  find  that
       the full time job offers for work which will not  require  skill  or
       English language on the minimum wage made to the second,  third  and
       fourth appellants, who are all young adults, are for real  work  and
       made in good faith by businessmen in the Afghan  community  who  are
       able to make those offers and  who  are  motivated  by  being  close
       friends of AGD and aware of the compassionate circumstances  of  the
       appellants.  The  letters  are  supported  with  evidence   of   the
       businesses and of course NK gave oral evidence  in  support  of  his
       offer. In addition, both OD and AGD are in work, and  OD  has  �2000
       worth of savings.

   43. Weighing  in  the  appellants  favour  are  the  following  matters.
       Firstly, it weighs heavily in the appellants favour that I find that
       family life cannot take place anywhere else in the world.  OD  is  a
       recognised refugee with indefinite leave to remain in  the  UK.  The
       evidence of Dr Giustozzi is that he remains at real risk of  serious
       harm from the Taliban if he were to return  to  Afghanistan;  it  is
       also the view of Dr Giustozzi that the appellants would be  at  risk
       of serious harm from the Taliban were they to  return  home.  Family
       life, I find therefore, cannot take place in Afghanistan. OD has  no
       right to live in Pakistan, as, like the appellants, I  find  he  was
       never granted any permission to be there as a  refugee,  or  in  any
       other capacity, at any point (and of course he has in any case  been
       absent from that country now for seven years): this is his  evidence
       and accords with the expert evidence from Dr Giustozzi which  I  set
       out above. It is also clear from the report of Dr Giustozzi that  it
       is not the current policy of  the  Pakistani  authorities  to  grant
       permission to remain to Afghan refugees, and indeed they  are  often
       arbitrarily deported for being in  Pakistan  without  authorisation.
       This evidence is support by that of Human Rights Watch Reports  from
       2016 and 2017. In this context accept the evidence of  OD,  AGD,  WM
       and Dr H that the appellants live with no  legal  status,  and  that
       this has led to them having almost no private life in  Pakistan  and
       driven  them  to  hide  in  very  remote  locations   in   extremely
       impoverished circumstances. I find that family life cannot therefore
       take place in Pakistan,  as  OD  cannot  be  expected  to  join  the
       appellants as he has no right to reside there, would not  safe  from
       refoulement there and the given the fact that the  circumstances  in
       which the appellants live are unduly harsh.

   44. Secondly, I find, that it weighs in the appellants favour that there
       are compelling compassionate  circumstances.  The  totality  of  the
       evidence from the witnesses, supported by pictures taken by  WM,  is
       that the appellants are living in desperate absolute poverty  in  an
       animal shelter with no doors or windows, no electricity, no  running
       or even potable water, no access to communications with OD or  other
       family and due to  their  lack  of  status/  fear  of  expulsion  to
       Afghanistan / fear  of  militants  operating  in  this  remote  area
       (matters supported by the expert and country of origin evidence) the
       second appellant, AD, has had no education during his childhood  and
       they have no proper access to medical services. The situation is  so
       desperate that Dr H felt that it was  exceptionally  distressing  to
       witness even in the context of someone who has lived in  Afghanistan
       and worked at a senior level in health services in Afghanistan,  and
       further Dr H expressed particular concern as a  medical  doctor  for
       the second appellant who is at risk of  infection  as  he  lives  in
       insanitary conditions and is bleeding.

   45. Thirdly, I find that the strength of the family  life  described  at
       paragraphs 38-39 above, and the features that OD has been the father
       figure to the second appellant, AD, since he was four years old, who
       is now just entering adulthood as an  18  years  old  having  had  a
       childhood deprived of education and lived in fear of insurgents, and
       current suffering from medical  problems,  and  the  fact  that  the
       appellants are all pre-flight family of OD also weighs  strongly  in
       their favour.

   46. Ultimately, weighing all of the evidence, I find that  the  decision
       to refuse entry clearance is a  disproportionate  interference  with
       the appellants' and OA's right to respect for family  life  for  the
       following reasons. I find the  public interest in the maintenance of
       immigration control due to the appellants not being able  to  fulfil
       the requirements of the Immigration Rules and  the  disadvantage  to
       their integration of their currently being unable to  speak  English
       is outweighed by the following factors: the fact  that  family  life
       cannot take place elsewhere; the  fact  that  there  are  compelling
       compassionate  circumstances  relating  to  the  appellants'  living
       circumstances which include the dire poverty in which they live, the
       second   appellant's   untreated   medical   problems,    and    the
       precariousness of their status in Pakistan which lays them  open  to
       expulsion to Afghanistan where they face  a  well  founded  fear  of
       persecution; and the strength of the family ties which includes  the
       second appellant's father/son bond with OA.




         Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. The Panel set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing
      the appeal on human rights grounds.

   3. I re-make the appeal by allowing it under Article 8 ECHR.


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. I do so in order to avoid a likelihood of serious harm  arising
to  the  sponsor  and  his  family  who  are  recognised  refugees  and  the
appellants  who  appear  also  to  be  refugees   and   who   live   without
documentation in Pakistan.

Annex A: Error of Law Decision


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The appellants are citizens of Afghanistan: the first  appellant  is
       the mother of the second, third and fourth appellants.  Their  dates
       of birth are 1962, 2003, 1998 and 1999 respectively. They reside  in
       Pakistan with no lawful status having fled from  the  Taliban  after
       the killing of the first appellant's husband/ father of the  second,
       third  and  fourth  appellants,  who  was  a  district  governor  in
       Afghanistan. They have applied to come to the UK to join Mr OD,  the
       sponsor, who is the son of the first appellant and  sibling  of  the
       other appellants. He was granted refugee status and five years leave
       to remain on 26th June 2014, and was  awaiting  a  decision  on  his
       application for indefinite leave  to  remain  at  the  time  of  the
       hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal.  Mr  AGD,  brother  of  the
       sponsor, also a son of the first appellant and sibling of the  other
       appellants, also has leave to remain  in  the  UK  as  a  recognised
       refugee and supports the application of the appellants. DNA evidence
       has shown that the relationships  between  the  appellants  and  the
       sponsor is as claimed.

    2. The appellants applied for entry clearance to join the sponsor,  and
       were refused in a decision dated 15th November  2018.  At  the  same
       time Mr OD's wife and four children applied to join him.  They  were
       also refused, but when DNA evidence showed that they were related as
       claimed they were granted entry clearance and joined him in the  UK.
       The  appeal  of  these  appellants  against  the  refusal  of  entry
       clearance to join Mr OD was dismissed by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Meah, but there was an appeal to the Upper Tribunal and the decision
       of Judge Meah was set aside and remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
       for remaking, with no  findings  preserved.  The  appeal  was  again
       dismissed, this time by First-tier Tribunal Andonian, in a  decision
       promulgated on 13th September 2019.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Allen  on
       27th February 2020 on the basis  that  the  grounds  had  sufficient
       merit to make it appropriate to grant permission.

    4. The matter came  before  us  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law. The hearing was held at  a  remote  Skype
       for Business hearing in light of the need to reduce the transmission
       of the Covid-19 virus, and in  light  of  this  being  found  to  be
       acceptable by both parties, and being a means by  which  the  appeal
       could be fairly  and  justly  determined.  Unfortunately,  part  way
       through the hearing Judge Lindsley's computer screen froze,  and  so
       she had to share that of Mrs  Justice  Eady  for  the  rest  of  the
       hearing, but  this  did  not  in  any  way  affect  her  ability  to
       participate in the hearing.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5. In grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal,  drafted  by  Mr  Gordon
       Lee, for the appellant, and in written and oral submissions from  Mr
       R Jesurum, it is argued for the appellants, in summary, as follows.

    6. There are two issues to determine in this appeal.  Firstly,  whether
       the appellants could meet paragraph 319 of  the  Immigration  Rules,
       and secondly whether, if they could not meet  paragraph  319,  their
       exclusion was a disproportionate interference with  Article  8  ECHR
       when considered more widely.

    7. Mr Jesurum clarified that there is no challenge to the dismissal  of
       the appeal by reference to the Immigration Rules, although  some  of
       the findings on factual matters which  led  to  that  dismissal  are
       challenged. It is, however,  argued  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       erred in law in the determination of the wider Article 8 ECHR appeal
       in the following ways.

    8. Firstly, and primarily, it is argued that there  was  a  failure  to
       take  into  account  material  evidence,  particularly  the  witness
       statement of the sponsor's brother who resides in the  UK,  Mr  AGD,
       the letter from the appellants' landlord in  Pakistan,  the  medical
       evidence, updated country expert report from  Dr  Antonio  Giustozzi
       and country of origin evidence about the conditions faced by  Afghan
       refugees in Pakistan. When looking at  the  appeal  outside  of  the
       Immigration Rules on Article 8 ECHR  grounds,  it  was  particularly
       relevant to consider, arising out of that evidence,  the  fact  that
       the appellants were undocumented and  therefore  faced  difficulties
       moving around in Pakistan and with being harassed, and lived in fear
       of arrest and deportation to Afghanistan where they would be at real
       risk of serious harm. The situation in Pakistan was highly  material
       to the proportionality of the decisions under Article 8  ECHR,  and,
       it is argued, the First-tier Tribunal failed  to  engage  with  this
       evidence at paragraph 53 of the decision in reaching its conclusion.



    9. It is argued that the First-tier Tribunal secondly erred in  law  by
       failing to consider the best interests of the second appellant,  AD,
       who was and remains a child, when considering the proportionality of
       the decision to refuse  entry  clearance.  There  should  have  been
       consideration of his medical difficulties, his  lack  of  access  to
       education and employment, the risk  of  ill-treatment,  refoulement,
       and restriction on his movements in Pakistan  due  to  his  lack  of
       status there, and the precariousness of  his  accommodation.  It  is
       also argued that the sponsor stepped in as AD's father  figure  when
       his biological father was murdered in  Afghanistan  when  he  was  3
       years old, and that it is plainly in his best interests to  be  with
       the man who raised him.

   10. Thirdly, it is argued, that  the  approach  to  Article  8  ECHR  is
       insufficiently structured. In particular, there is no finding as  to
       whether the appellants and sponsor have family life. It is said that
       it is clear from the evidence that they formed a household prior  to
       the sponsor's entry to the UK, and it is  argued  that  family  life
       continues in light of their difficulties and the sponsor's visits to
       Pakistan. It is argued that they cannot  reconstitute  their  family
       life in Afghanistan because Mr OD is a refugee, and they  cannot  do
       this in Pakistan because  he  and  they  would  be/are  at  risk  of
       refoulement and without any status there, and  that  this  also  was
       highly pertinent to the decision on proportionality. This is because
       this is a different type of balancing process to one where there  is
       a place where family life could  take  place,  but  is  not  of  the
       choosing of the parties. There was a failure  to  follow  a  Razgar,
       step by step approach by the First-tier Tribunal, and  this  led  to
       material defects in the decision.

   11. Fourthly, it is argued, that the First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  the
       assessment of credibility due to a failure to give  reasons  and  by
       virtue of a failure to take into account relevant material evidence.
       The First-tier Tribunal rejected the letters  offering  two  of  the
       appellants work without explaining why they rejected as credible the
       sponsor's evidence regarding these offers  of  work  being  genuine;
       although Mr Jesurum  accepted  that  the  findings  on  the  letters
       themselves cannot be challenged, he maintained the  wider  issue  of
       whether the third and fourth appellants might obtain work and become
       self-sufficient was not properly determined with regard  to  all  of
       the  evidence.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  required  there   to   be
       "definite" evidence that the appellants needed identity documents to
       rent a property in Pakistan, which applied  the  wrong  standard  of
       proof and also failed to consider the evidence in the country expert
       report and background country of origin reports. In finding that the
       appellants could continue to live in their current home there was  a
       failure to consider the letter from the landlord and evidence of the
       sponsor about his serious ill-health, and that his  younger  brother
       wanted the appellants to leave in these circumstances. It  was  also
       wrong to say that the family had fled after the "alleged  murder  of
       the sponsor's father in Afghanistan in 2006", at paragraph 36 of the
       decision, when this had been found to  have  taken  place,  and  was
       reflected in the sponsor's grant of refugee status.

   12. In a skeleton argument drafted by Mr C Avery, dated 8th  June  2020,
       and in oral submissions by  Mr  Melvin  for  the  respondent  it  is
       argued, in summary, as follows. In relation to the first ground:  it
       is said that it does not  follow  simply  because  evidence  is  not
       directly cited that it was not taken into account by the  First-tier
       Tribunal, and it was clear that the First-tier Tribunal did focus on
       the day to day problems for the appellants in Pakistan.  The  First-
       tier Tribunal was entitled to take into consideration the fact  that
       the appellants had managed to reside in Pakistan for a  long  period
       of time, for the past 13 years, and had  not  applied  to  join  the
       sponsor for a period of four years after he left Pakistan,  and  the
       fact that the appellants had managed to obtain medical treatment and
       had accommodation; further, it was contended by Mr Melvin, thousands
       of Afghans had found that it was safe enough for them to return home
       to Afghanistan from Pakistan.

   13. In relation to the second ground, the best interests of  the  second
       appellant, AM, as a child, were  considered  as  his  situation  was
       considered as part of the wider group of appellants, and this was  a
       lawful approach. Even if the sponsor had been a father figure at one
       point in time, seven years had now elapsed, and the relationship was
       now reduced to the transfer of funds.

   14. In relation to ground three, it is argued that it is not an error of
       law to fail to have a structured approach so long  as  all  elements
       were covered in the decision. All relevant issues  were  determined.
       Mr Melvin argued that the First-tier  Tribunal  had  concluded  that
       family life did not exist, and looked at the proportionality of  any
       interference as well.

   15. In relation to the fourth ground it is argued that  this  is  simply
       any attempt to re-argue the case, the  findings  on  the  employment
       letters were open to the First-tier Tribunal and  the  finding  that
       the appellants had not shown they were likely to be  made  destitute
       any time soon likewise.

   16. At the end of the hearing we told the parties that we concluded that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law  in  determination  of  the
       wider Article 8 ECHR appeal and would  set  aside  all  the  factual
       findings but preserve the decision that  the  appellants  could  not
       meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at paragraph 319, but
       that our full reasons would be sent in writing. Mr Jesurum submitted
       that  the  extent  of  fact  finding  was  such  that  it  would  be
       appropriate to remit the appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  but  we
       concluded that the appeal should be re-made in the Upper Tribunal as
       it would ultimately turn only on a limited number of issues.

   Conclusions - Error of Law

   17. It was correctly understood by the First-tier Tribunal that the  key
       issues to determine in the appeal were whether the appellants  could
       meet the Immigration Rules at paragraph 319, or whether the decision
       was a disproportionate breach of Article 8 ECHR, as is  set  out  at
       paragraph 6 of the decision. The requirements  of  paragraph  319(v)
       are set out at paragraph 21 of the decision, and  there  is  further
       mention of the need to look at Article  8  ECHR  more  generally  at
       paragraph 22 of the decision. It  is  noted  that  the  requirements
       under paragraph 319(v) of the Immigration Rules would  be  that  the
       appellants  had  to  be  living  alone  in  the   most   exceptional
       compassionate circumstances; they must be financially  dependent  on
       the refugee sponsor;  and  must  be  able  to  be  accommodated  and
       supported adequately without recourse to public funds in the UK; and
       there must be no relative to whom they could turn to for support  in
       their country of origin.

   18. In determining the appeal  under  paragraph  319(v)  the  First-tier
       Tribunal looks, at paragraphs 32 to  50  of  the  decision,  at  the
       issues of accommodation and medical treatment,  and  the  issues  of
       financial support and accommodation in the UK. No challenge is  made
       the findings that the sponsor could not accommodate  the  appellants
       adequately if they were to come to the UK, and it is noted that  the
       sponsor accepts that he lives in overcrowded accommodation  in  this
       country. We therefore uphold the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
       that the appellants did not succeed in their human rights appeal  by
       reference to the Immigration Rules.

   19. Looking at  the  reasoning  for  the  factual  findings:  reasonable
       reasons are given for not giving weight  to  the  letters  from  the
       manager of Go Go Pizza offering employment to the third  and  fourth
       appellants,  at  paragraph  46  to  48.  The  conclusions  that  the
       appellants still currently lived with their landlord H Gul,  despite
       the fact that he was unwell and his brother, J Gul, would like  them
       to leave, at paragraph 40  of  the  decision,  and  that  they  have
       accessed medical treatment when needed through  their  friends,  are
       sufficiently well reasoned and were  also  open  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal.

   20. In determining the appeal more broadly on Article 8 ECHR grounds  we
       find however that firstly there  is  a  material  error  of  law  in
       failing to decide whether the appellants have family life  with  the
       sponsor, and whether refusal of entry clearance is  an  interference
       with that family life relationship. It is not possible  to  conclude
       that this issue was determined at paragraph 51 of the decision:  all
       that  is  decided  in  that  paragraph  is  that  there   were   not
       "exceptional compelling compassionate circumstances"  in  this  case
       justifying the entry of the appellants based on a private or  family
       life application. The starting point of this decision needed to be a
       decision on  whether  family  life  currently  existed  between  the
       sponsor and his family and the appellants, based on the evidence  of
       cohabitation as a single household in Afghanistan,  flight  together
       to Pakistan in 2007, then the sponsor leaving for the  UK  in  2014,
       and his wife and children joining him in 2019, in the context of the
       evidence  about  on-going  visits,  telephone  calls  and  financial
       support. Then it needed to  be  decided  whether  refusal  of  entry
       clearance interfered with the family life that existed.  Neither  of
       these vital tasks were undertaken by the First-tier Tribunal.

   21. The First-tier Tribunal did conduct a  proportionality  exercise  at
       paragraph 53 of the decision, with a proper direction to look at the
       matter holistically. It was lawfully open to the First-tier Tribunal
       to consider against the appellants that to date the  appellants  had
       found accommodation and accessed medical treatment  for  the  second
       appellant in Pakistan, and that if they came to the  UK  they  would
       probably be reliant on public funds for accommodation. It  was  also
       clearly to be weighed against the appellants  that  they  could  not
       meet the Immigration Rules, although this was not explicitly done.

   22. We find, however, that there was  a  failure  to  consider  material
       evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  going  to  the  precarious
       residence of all of the appellants in Pakistan in the expert  report
       of Dr Guistozzi, the background country of origin reports,  and  the
       specific unchallenged evidence of the witness Mr AGD about  problems
       with  the  Pakistani  police  when  he  visited,  and   thus   their
       vulnerability to refoulement to Afghanistan where there was evidence
       of an on-going real risk of persecution due to the unlawful  killing
       of the husband of the first appellant and father of the sponsor  and
       other appellants by the Taliban. It also  needed  to  be  considered
       whether any family life could take place elsewhere if the appellants
       are not admitted to the UK,  as  this  again  was  material  to  the
       proportionality of the decision. There  was  further  a  failure  to
       consider the best interests of the second appellant, AD, who was  at
       the time of hearing and remains a child, and with respect to whom  -
       on top of the  evidence  regarding  danger  due  to  his  precarious
       residence in Pakistan - there was  evidence  that  the  sponsor  had
       taken on the role of father, and, further,  with  respect  to  whom,
       there was evidence he had not been able to access  education.  These
       best interests  ought  to  have  been  a  primary  consideration  in
       determining the appeal, and we find that they were not considered as
       such. We find that  the  evidence  omitted  from  consideration  was
       highly material to the balancing exercise, and it cannot be said, if
       it had been weighed in the balancing exercise, that the appeal could
       not have been determined differently.

   23. In these circumstances we set aside all of the factual  findings  of
       the First-tier Tribunal,  as  the  factual  scenario  in  which  the
       appellants are now living has moved on and the Article 8 ECHR appeal
       must be determined at the date of the new hearing, but preserve,  as
       mentioned  above,  the  finding  that  the   requirements   of   the
       Immigration Rules could not be met, which has remained  unchallenged
       in the appeal.




         Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. We set aside the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  dismissing  the
      appeal on human rights grounds and the factual findings of the  First-
      tier Tribunal.

   3. We adjourn the re-making of the appeal and  find  that  it  should  be
      remade in the Upper Tribunal.


   Directions

        i) The remaking hearing will consist of a remote Skype for Business
           hearing.

       ii) A revised  bundle  containing  only  up  to  date  and  relevant
           evidence, including updating  materials,  should  be  filed  and
           served ten days prior to the remaking hearing.

      iii) If an  interpreter  is  required  the  Upper  Tribunal  must  be
           notified when the notice of hearing is sent out.

       iv) The time estimate is 3 hours.


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) we make an anonymity order. Unless the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. We do so in  order  to  avoid  a  likelihood  of  serious  harm
arising to the sponsor and his family who are recognised  refugees  and  the
appellants  who  appear  also  to  be  refugees   and   who   live   without
documentation in Pakistan.
