Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Ms Elliott-Kelly (KBM Solicitors)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  28   September   2015   allowing   the
       Respondent's appeal, itself brought against a refusal  of  leave  and
       removal directions under section 47 of  the  Immigration  Asylum  and
       Nationality Act 2006 of 23 December 2014.


    2. Rana Tahir Ali was born on 17 January 1989.  He  entered  the  United
       Kingdom as a student on 28 May 2011 and his leave was extended  until
       28 June 2014, when following his marriage to Saba  Ahmed,  a  British
       citizen, he applied for leave to remain as her partner under Appendix
       FM. The application was refused because it was considered that  false
       information had been supplied on the  application  in  the  light  of
       information from ETS stating that his English language  test  results
       had  been  identified  as  invalid.  Although  the  relationship  was
       accepted as genuine and it was thus accepted  that  Ms  Ahmed  was  a
       qualifying Sponsor  given  her  citizenship,  the  application  under
       Appendix FM failed because of the inability to meet  the  Suitability
       requirements  in  the  light  of  the  deception.  No  insurmountable
       obstacles to the couple's relocation to Pakistan had been  identified
       and so they could not meet the proviso in the exception in any event.
       It was not accepted that he would be unable to integrate in his  home
       country given his extended  family  and  friends  there  and  so  the
       application failed having regard to Rule  276ADE  addressing  private
       life;  outside  the  Rules,  the  public  interest   in   maintaining
       immigration control overrode any family life the couple  might  enjoy
       together.


    3. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the Secretary  of  State's  case  on
       dishonesty because  the  Judge  noted  that  the  well-known  generic
       evidence from Peter Millington and Rebecca Collings usually relied on
       in cases of this nature was not before her, and  nor  was  any  case-
       specific witness statement; thus "there is not a  shred  of  evidence
       that the appellant had used a proxy to pass his spoken  part  of  his
       test"; furthermore the Appellant had been offered the opportunity  to
       retake the test  with  an  alternative  provider,  and  had  done  so
       successfully, and additionally had demonstrated good command  of  the
       language in his oral evidence.


    4. As to  the  private  and  family  life  application,  the  First-tier
       Tribunal's reasoning is rather difficult to follow, but I  understand
       its thinking to have been that the claim under Appendix FM would have
       failed, notwithstanding the  demonstration  of  suitability  for  the
       route given the rejection of the  Home  Office  case  on  ETS  fraud,
       because there  were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  couple's
       relocation abroad, taking their cases as adults, absent  any  chronic
       or acute health issues or evidence of ties here  that  could  not  be
       maintained electronically.  However  the  existence  of  the  British
       citizen son, born on  11  June  2015,  after  the  decision  appealed
       against, changed the equation, and did  represent  an  insurmountable
       obstacle against removal, as the Sponsor had never lived in Pakistan,
       and would have to negotiate  an  unfamiliar  health  service  without
       family support during  a  period  in  which  she  suffered  from  low
       emotional moods that  might  well  signal  the  onset  of  post-natal
       depression.  Assessing the claim outside the Rules, the Appellant had
       established family life here with his wife and son which would suffer
       interference of sufficient gravity to engage Article 8 of  the  ECHR,
       and his removal abroad would be disproportionate given that it  would
       have an unreasonable impact on the  child  for  the  reasons  already
       stated.


    5. At the hearing before me the Secretary of State sought  to  adduce  a
       transmission verification report showing that a 28-page fax had  been
       transmitted successfully from the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer's
       Unit comprising the generic witness statements and a short  statement
       from Mona Shah explaining that the Home Office had been  notified  by
       ETS via a spreadsheet of the identification of the Respondent's  test
       results as suspect.


    6. Mr Wilding argued that the Secretary of State had done all within her
       power to adduce the relevant evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal
       and it was procedurally unfair for the appeal to have been determined
       as if there had been no material whatsoever  capable  of  discharging
       the burden of proof that lay upon  the  Home  Office  in  a  "general
       refusal reasons" case. For the Respondent, Ms Elliott-Wildy submitted
       that the failure to have regard to the evidence was not material: the
       new material did not reveal any fundamental change of case on  behalf
       of the Secretary of State which could be said to  have  disadvantaged
       the Appellant. The evidence from Ms Shah was insufficient to pass the
       minimal threshold to raise any case of dishonesty for her  client  to
       answer.

Findings and reasons


    7. I considered it appropriate to admit the further evidence given  that
       it was plainly central to the issues in the appeal. Having  done  so,
       it was readily  apparent  that,  on  balance  of  probabilities,  the
       relevant material should have been before the Judge given that it had
       been sent to the First-tier Tribunal before the date of hearing,  and
       that any failure was not down to the  conduct  of  the  Secretary  of
       State. It is readily apparent that a procedural irregularity of  this
       nature is a material error of law.


    8. Had this material been before the First-tier Tribunal, it  is  likely
       to have had at least some effect on its  reasoning.  As  set  out  in
       Qadir [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC) at [68],

           "we have substantial reservations about the strength and quality
           of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence.  Its  shortcomings  are
           manifest. On the other hand, while  bearing  in  mind  that  the
           context is one of alleged deception, we must be mindful  of  the
           comparatively  modest  threshold  which  an  evidential   burden
           entails. The calls for an evaluative assessment on the  part  of
           the tribunal. By an admittedly narrow margin  we  are  satisfied
           that the Secretary of State  has  discharged  this  burden.  The
           effect of this is that there is a burden,  again  an  evidential
           one, on the Appellants of raising an innocent explanation."


    9. So material reminiscent of  that  which  was  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal  has  been  judicially  determined  in  a  precedent-setting
       decision to, albeit by a small margin, cross the threshold to require
       the Appellant to address the allegation of dishonesty. Thus the First-
       tier Tribunal was wrong to conclude there was no material capable  of
       demonstrating the Appellant's  provision  of  English  language  test
       results to have been  dishonest:  the  print-out  from  ETS  and  the
       statement of Mona Shah together constituted  sufficient  evidence  to
       raise a case to be answered.


   10. Furthermore, I note that the  First-tier  Tribunal  relied  upon  the
       Appellant's English language  proficiency  as  it  was  displayed  in
       evidence before her:  in  the  light  of  the  Secretary  of  State's
       submission in Qadir at [91] that a migrant's "command of English  may
       have improved between the date of the tests and the hearing of  their
       appeals", it was accordingly appropriate "[to place] no  reliance  on
       the apparent English language  proficiency  of  either  Appellant  as
       displayed in their evidence to the Tribunal."


   11. In these circumstances I consider the decision below is flawed as  to
       the assessment of the Respondent's honesty in the  provision  of  ETS
       results. Absent lawful evaluation of that issue, it is impossible  to
       say whether public  interest  factors  such  as  historic  dishonesty
       should be weighed in the scales during the proportionality  balancing
       exercise when it came to assess the human  rights  claim,  inside  or
       outside the Immigration Rules. Thus the basis  on  which  the  appeal
       succeeded below is undermined. The appeal must therefore be reheard.


   12. I do not consider it appropriate to reopen the findings of fact  made
       as to the reality of the Respondent's ties with  the  United  Kingdom
       and the genuineness of her relationship with her partner and  child).
       Whilst normally one might have to acknowledge the potential relevance
       of arguable dishonesty vis-�-vis English  language  test  results  to
       issues as to private and family life, I note that  the  Secretary  of
       State had not disputed the asserted facts in her refusal letter,  and
       did not attend the hearing below in order to press that case further.
       In these circumstances I think it would be wrong for those issues  to
       be relitigated given the supine posture so far  struck  by  the  Home
       Office.


          Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  flawed  by
    material error of law.
    The appeal is remitted for hearing afresh  (subject  to  the  preserved
    findings identified above).

Signed:                                            Date: 9 June 2016
