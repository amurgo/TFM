                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 20 July 2020 of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Neville which dismissed the appeal of the appellant
    against refusal of indefinite leave to remain.

 2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 5 March 1989.

 3. The appellant came to the UK on 27 October 2009 with  leave  to  remain
    until 31 October 2012.  On 19 October 2012 he applied for further leave
    to remain as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  On 1 July  2013  that  application
    was refused.  The appellant appealed and his appeal was allowed  on  22
    May 2015, the First-tier Tribunal decision remitting the  case  to  the
    respondent for further consideration.

 4. The respondent again refused the application on 5  November  2015.   An
    appeal against the decision was again allowed on the basis that it  was
    remitted to the Secretary of State on 27 February 2017.

 5. The respondent refused the application again  on  30  June  2017.   The
    appellant again appealed. His  appeal  reference  in  that  matter  was
    IA/00196/2017. On 4 September 2018 the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed
    his appeal. The appellant challenged the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and on 14 February 2019 the Upper Tribunal found an  error  of
    law and remitted the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for remaking.

 6. In a decision issued on 18 March 2019, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Aujla
    again dismissed the appeal.

 7. It is at this point that the parties disagree  as  to  the  appellant's
    legal position. The respondent maintains that he became  appeal  rights
    exhausted on 2 April 2019 as he did not appeal the decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Aujla. The respondent therefore considers that  when  the
    appellant made an indefinite leave to remain  (ILR)  application  under
    paragraph 276B on 1 October 2019, he could not show  the  requisite  10
    years' continuous lawful leave.

 8. The appellant maintains that he did not  receive  the  decision  of  18
    March 2019. He believed that the appeal remained pending and  that  his
    s.3C leave also continued. On 1 October 2019 he applied for ILR on that
    basis, maintaining that as of 27 October 2019  he  would  have  had  10
    years'  continuous  lawful  leave.  The  respondent's  view   of   that
    application is as set  out  in  the  previous  paragraph  and  the  ILR
    application was refused on 7 October 2019 as the appellant did not have
    10 years' continuous lawful leave

 9. The appellant maintains that the refusal of the ILR application alerted
    him to the decision of Judge Aujla issued  on  18  March  2019  and  he
    requested a copy of it from the First-tier Tribunal. He  obtained  that
    decision on 15 October 2019. He  lodged  an  out  of  time  application
    against it, requesting that time be extended to admit  his  application
    for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

10. In a decision of 29 January 2020, First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Macdonald
    extended time for an application to challenge the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal in  IA/00196/2017.   The  appellant  maintains  that  the
    extension of time meant that his appeal should be regarded  as  pending
    between 2 April 2019 and when he lodged his appeal against the decision
    after receiving it on 15 October 2019 and that he should be regarded as
    having had s.3C leave over the same period of time.

11. Meanwhile, as well as pursuing his challenge to the decision  of  Judge
    Aujla in IA/00196/2017, the appellant  lodged  an  appeal  against  the
    decision of 7 October  2019  which  refused  ILR.  That  led  to  these
    proceedings.

12. The appeal against the decision of 7 October 2019  came  before  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Neville on 20 February 2020.  Judge Neville set out
    the core issue to be decided in paragraph 2 of his  decision;  did  the
    appellant have s.3C leave on 1 October 2019 as  his  appeal  was  still
    pending as provided in s.104 of the Nationality Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 or was the appeal "finally determined"  on  2  April  2019  at
    which point his leave ended?

13. Judge Neville did  not  decide  that  question  immediately  where  the
    respondent was not represented at the hearing and  the  views  of  both
    parties on the case of Niaz (NIAA 2002  Section  104:  pending  appeal)
    [2019] UKUT 399 (IAC) were considered necessary.  He  directed  written
    submissions on the key  issue  and  both  parties  complied  with  that
    direction.

14. In his decision issued on 20 July 2020 Judge Neville concluded that the
    appellant's  previous  appeal   (IA/00196/2017)   had   been   "finally
    determined" as of 2 April 2019. The appellant did not have s.3C or  any
    other kind of leave after that date. He therefore  could  not  show  10
    years' continuous lawful residence for the purposes of paragraph  276B.



15. The reasons for this conclusion are set out in paragraphs 4  to  10  of
    the decision. The core of the appellant's written submissions  was  set
    out in paragraph 4 of the decision. The appellant maintained that there
    was no dispute that he had not received the  decision  of  Judge  Aujla
    until 15 October 2019. The First-tier Tribunal,  when  extending  time,
    had accepted that to be so. I can indicate here that that point remains
    undisputed now. The appellant argued, however,  that  his  only  having
    received the decision  as  of  15  October  2019  should  lead  to  the
    conclusion that valid service had not taken place until that date.

16. Judge Neville did not accept that argument. He found in paragraph 5  of
    the decision that there had been no administrative error such that  the
    appellant could show invalid service when the decision of  Judge  Aujla
    was issued on 18 March 2019. On the contrary,  he  First-tier  Tribunal
    had followed the service provisions set out in Rule 33 of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (First-tier) (Immigration and  Asylum  Chamber)  Rules  2014.
    Having set out Rule 33, Judge Neville continued:

         "6.  Time can therefore be seen to run from when the  decision  and
             reasons are sent, not received.  The  appellant's  application
             for an extension of time  was  fully  argued  in  the  written
             grounds that accompanied the  permission  application  itself.
             It also attached the relevant correspondence with the Tribunal
             as well as a signed certificate  by  the  Tribunal  member  of
             staff who originally sent Judge Aujla's decision.  These  show
             that the decision and reasons were sent  to  both  parties  by
             email on 18 March 2019.   The  appellant  has  never  disputed
             this, either  before  Judge  Macdonald  or  myself,  asserting
             instead that they were never received.  Indeed,  this  is  why
             Judge Macdonald considered it appropriate to extend time.

         7.   All this means that the appellant's  first  argument  must  be
             rejected.  Time for permission to appeal started to  run  when
             the decision and reasons were sent.  It expired fourteen  days
             later.  Again contrary to  the  appellant's  submissions,  the
             principles set out by the House of Lords in R  (Anufrijeva)  v
             SSHD [2003] UKHL 36 do not require a different outcome.   This
             is not a case of a  person  being  unjustly  disadvantaged  or
             bound  by  an  administrative  decision  that  has  not   been
             communicated and therefore cannot  be  challenged.   It  is  a
             process that provides for a judicial decision to be challenged
             by way of onward appeal but first requires  permission  to  be
             sought within a certain time of a definite event,  being  when
             the reasons for the decision under challenge were sent to  the
             relevant party.  The discretion to extend time exists for just
             such eventualities as occurred here, where  the  reasons  were
             sent but never received.  The appellant next  argues  that  an
             appeal cannot conceptionally be  "finally  determined"  twice.
             This argument falters on Niaz, the Upper Tribunal holding that
             it most certainly can.  I see no reason for distinguishing the
             present situation.  Indeed, the issue arising in  this  appeal
             is much more straightforward than that with  which  the  Upper
             Tribunal had to grapple in Niaz.  I  see  no  tension  between
             Section 104 and  the  scheme  for  onward  appeals  from  this
             Tribunal.  Pursuant to Section  104(2)(a)  an  appeal  is  not
             finally  determined  at  any  time  when  an  application  for
             permission to appeal "could be  made".   Before  the  relevant
             time limit expires, a dissatisfied appellant has  an  absolute
             entitlement to make an application for permission  to  appeal.
             He or she will meet Section 104(2)(a).  Afterwards however, as
             stated in the headnote to Bhavsar (late application  for  PTA:
             procedure) [2019] UKUT 196:

                  (1)  There is nothing in the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-
                      tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules
                      2014  that  prevents  the  First-tier  Tribunal  from
                      refusing to admit an application  for  permission  to
                      appeal to the Upper Tribunal, where  the  application
                      is made outside the relevant time limit and the First-
                      tier Tribunal does not extend time.

         10.  On 19 October 2019 the appellant could not make an application
             for permission  to  appeal,  because  he  first  required  the
             Tribunal to extend the time limit for doing so.  He  therefore
             met none of the circumstances listed at  Section  104(2).   It
             being held in Niaz that those  circumstances  are  exhaustive,
             his appeal must therefore have been finally determined and  no
             longer pending.  On the agreed  chronology  it  had  not  been
             pending since 2 April 2019, when the  time  permitted  for  an
             application for  permission  to  appeal  expired.   He  became
             pending once more upon Judge Macdonald's  decision  to  extend
             time, because an application for permission  to  appeal  could
             then be made to the  Upper  Tribunal  within  the  time  limit
             provided by its Procedure Rules.  This does nothing  to  alter
             the fact that no application for permission to appeal could be
             made before he did so."

17. The appellant obtained permission to appeal  against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Neville on a narrow basis. The First-tier  Tribunal
    interpretation of s.104 and Niaz regarding pending appeals and when  an
    appeal is "finally determined" was not challenged. The only  ground  of
    challenge is that in paragraph 6 of the decision, Judge Neville made  a
    material mistake of fact  in  stating  that  the  appellant  had  never
    disputed that the First-tier Tribunal had served correctly the decision
    of Judge Aujla in  IA/00196/2017  on  18  March  2019.  The  judge  was
    mistaken as the appellant had made such a challenge. That was shown  by
    the inclusion at page 37 of the appellant's bundle of a case note  from
    the First-tier Tribunal, presumably from October 2019, which stated:

         "Tc from rep re progress of appeal.  Nothing on Aria  since  March.
         Rep advised that they did not receive an IA60, no note on  Aria  to
         confirm this either.   Please  can  rep  receive  a  call  back  to
         advise?"

18. It was conceded for the appellant before me that his  position  in  his
    grounds and written submissions before Judge Neville  on  good  service
    having occurred on 18 March 2019 was "neutral". That is not an accurate
    description of the appellant's position on  whether  the  good  service
    point before Judge Neville. He did not argue it.  He  did  not  at  any
    point submit before Judge Neville  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    failed to follow Rule 33 or in some other way  failed  to  effect  good
    service of the decision of Judge Aujla on 18 March 2019. His  case  was
    only that he did not receive the decision until 15  October  2019.  The
    appellant could have argued that the decision of Judge  Aujla  was  not
    properly served in his grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal. He
    did not. He could have done so in  his  written  submissions  dated  11
    March 2020 which were specifically  directed by Judge Neville in  order
    to fully ventilate the issues in the case. He did not. I did  not  find
    that mere inclusion of the case note on  page  37  of  the  appellant's
    bundle was capable of showing  that  the  appellant  did  dispute  good
    service before Judge Neville.

19. Further, the appellant also did not challenge good  service  as  of  18
    March  2019  when  seeking  an  extension  of   time   to   appeal   in
    IA/00196/2019.  His position was the same as in this  appeal,  that  he
    had not received the decision. It was  on  that  basis  that  time  was
    extended without there being any consideration of whether good  service
    had occurred on 18 March 2019.

20. Judge Neville was therefore correct to find  that  there  had  been  no
    dispute that the decision of Judge Aujla was emailed to the parties  in
    line with the proper service provisions on 18 March 2019 and  no  error
    of law arises from that.

21. For what it is worth, as discussed with  the  parties  before  me,  the
    Tribunal's ARIA printout  from  appeal  IA/00196/2017  shows  that  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Aujla was sent to the appellant's
    representatives on 18 March  2019.  The  notice  that  accompanied  the
    decision indicated that the decision was sent to both parties by  email
    on that date.  Against  those  clear  and  consistent  records,  it  is
    difficult to see how the telephone note at page 37 of  the  appellant's
    bundle could be found sufficient to show  that  good  service  did  not
    occur on 18 March 2019.

22. For these reasons, I did not find that  the  grounds  had  merit.   The
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose a material  error
    on a point of law.

Notice of Decision

23. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.
