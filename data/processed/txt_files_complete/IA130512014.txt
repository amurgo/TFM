Representation:
For the Appellant:     No appearance and unrepresented
For the Respondent:    Mr Duffy (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. The appellant had been  granted
    leave to study at Leicester international College and  that  leave  was
    valid until August 15, 2015. The respondent curtailed  his  leave  with
    immediate effect on February 28, 2014  and  at  the  same  time  issued
    removal directions pursuant to Section 47 of  the  Immigration,  Asylum
    and Nationality Act 2006.
 2.  The  appellant  appealed  under  section  82(1)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on march 13, 2014.

 3. The  matter  came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Howard
    (hereinafter referred to as the "FtTJ") as a paper case on  August  15,
    2014 and in a decision promulgated on September 17, 2014  he  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.

 4. The appellant lodged grounds  of  appeal  on  September  26,  2014.  He
    submitted the FtTJ erred because the respondent had failed  to  produce
    any evidence that supported her claim.

 5. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Nicholson granted permission to appeal
    on December 10, 2014 finding that in light of JC (Part 9 HC  395-burden
    of proof) China [2007] UKAIT 00027 the burden of  proving  a  precedent
    fact lay on the party making the claim namely the respondent.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 6. The appellant's representatives wrote to the Tribunal  on  January  27,
    2015  and  advised  that  they  were  without  instructions  and   were
    withdrawing from the appeal. They provided evidence that suggested  the
    appellant or someone at his place of residence had refused to sign  for
    mail sent to him at his last known address.

 7. Mr Duffy indicated that the appellant had also now  ceased  signing  on
    having been served with a section 10 removal decision.

 8. I was satisfied the appellant  had  been  served  with  the  notice  of
    hearing as a notice had been sent to both him and  his  representatives
    on December 29, 2014. I agreed to deal with the application.

    ERROR OF LAW

 9. Mr Duffy accepted that the failure to  submit  the  evidence  from  the
    college was a failing and he further accepted the  FtTJ  had  erred  in
    dismissing the appeal in the absence of evidence to support the refusal
    letter.

    REMAKING THE DECISION

10. I extended Mr Duffy an opportunity to submit the  missing  evidence  on
    the basis that this evidence was before me by February 3, 2015.  I  was
    provided with a copy of the notification from  the  sponsoring  college
    that the appellant had failed to enrol with the college  and  that  the
    sponsorship had been withdrawn on December 16,  2013.  I  admitted  the
    evidence under Rule 15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 as  the  appellant  had  never  submitted  any  evidence  to
    contradict the respondent's claim and this evidence confirmed what  had
    been contained in the original refusal letter.

11. I therefore dismiss the appellant's appeal.

Decision

12. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did disclose an  error  in  law
    and I remake this decision and I dismiss the appellant's appeal.

13. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended)  an  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. No
    order was made in the First-tier and I see  no  reason  to  amend  that
    order.
