For the Appellant:     Mr S Shah (for 786 Law Associates)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola (Home Office Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is the appeal of Jasdeep Singh, a citizen of India born 29 May
         1989 against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal of  24  August
         2017 dismissing his appeal on human rights grounds, itself  brought
         against the refusal of a visit visa, of 6 April  2016,  treated  by
         the Respondent as the refusal of a human rights claim.

      2. The Appellant applied for a visitor visa to attend the  funeral  of
         his maternal uncle, the application form explaining that his  uncle
         was childless and had treated him as his son. Accordingly it  would
         be appropriate for him to participate in  the  appropriate  rituals
         and traditions.

      3.  The  application  was  refused  because  at  question  28  of  the
         application  form  Mr  Singh  had  stated  he  had  not  made   any
         application to remain in the UK  in  the  last  10  years:  however
         checks  conducted  by  the  decision  maker   revealed   his   full
         immigration history. He had entered the country as  a  student  and
         remained here for a significant period. He had made an  application
         to remain in the UK on 25 October  2011,  and  apparently  had  his
         student leave curtailed. He had subsequently applied for  leave  to
         remain  as  the  spouse  of  Rupinder  Kaur  and  remained  for   a
         significant period after the refusal  of  that  application  on  31
         December 2012, until 11 April 2013. He had previously been  refused
         an entry clearance on 2 September 2015, and three  applications  to
         visit the USA had been refused. His failure to reveal these  events
         in his past in the course of his application represented dishonesty
         conduct justifying a mandatory refusal of the application.

      4. There were also concerns as to the application's  ability  to  meet
         the Rules given that there was a discrepancy between  the  earnings
         he claimed to receive compared  to  his  salary;  receipts  in  his
         personal bank account bore no relation to his asserted earnings.

      5. Overall the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO") was not satisfied  that
         the Appellant would leave the UK at the end of his visit.

      6. The First-tier Tribunal directed itself that this was an appeal  on
         the human rights grounds, where the fact that a right of appeal had
         been recognised effectively accepted the  establishment  of  family
         life.  However  the  live  question  for  determination   was   the
         proportionality of the decision.

      7. The First-tier Tribunal noted the evidence from the Appellant  that
         he had provided his immigration history to an agent in writing  who
         then completed the application form for him, though no copy of that
         document had ever been supplied. This was  a  different  answer  to
         that given by the Appellant's father, who said  that  his  son  had
         made a mistake because he was upset about his  uncle's  death,  and
         that they had found the application form confusing:  they  had  not
         understood that his son had "been required to leave the  UK"  given
         he had pursued an appeal.

      8. Furthermore, the Appellant had written to the ECO on 18 April  2016
         stating that a covering letter giving his full immigration  history
         had been supplied on the application. No copy of  this  letter  was
         before the Tribunal, and nor was it referenced in submissions,  but
         given that the ECO had not acknowledged the assertion that  such  a
         letter had been written, the First-tier Tribunal concluded that the
         Respondent had not supplied cogent evidence such  as  to  discharge
         the  burden  of  proof  to  demonstrate  the  Appellant  had   been
         dishonest.

      9. There were other factual flaws in the Secretary  of  State's  case.
         Contrary to the indication in the refusal letter, his leave had not
         been  curtailed  before  the  spouse  application  was  made;   his
         immigration history as supplied by the Secretary  of  State  showed
         that he had in fact enjoyed leave throughout his time in the UK, as
         he had applied to vary leave to that of spouse before his  previous
         leave expired. His earnings were not only based on his  salary,  as
         he received additional rental income from property.

     10. Nevertheless, the First-tier Tribunal noted  that  the  Appellant's
         immigration  history  might  give  cause  for  concern  as  to  his
         intention to leave the country at the end of a visit. The Appellant
         had studied for several years without obtaining a qualification and
         it was unclear whether a letter subsequently explaining his history
         had been provided on the application; thus the fact of his previous
         applications  and  voluntary  departure  from  the  UK   had   gone
         unmentioned and overall the  ECO  "was  far  from  unjustified"  in
         concluding that he did not meet the requirements of the Rules.

     11. Assessing the Appellant's connections in the  UK  and  abroad,  his
         mother was relatively  young  and  in  good  health  and  travelled
         frequently to India, so could always see him there. His step father
         had visited him there and there was no evidence he could not do  so
         again notwithstanding that he  had  recently  suffered  from  heart
         problems. He had relatives living in India such as his grandmother,
         uncle and cousins, so could enjoy some degree of family life in his
         country of origin.

     12.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  concluded   that   the   decision   was
         disproportionate in so far  as  it  relied  on  a  general  refusal
         reason, but proportionate given the  failings  in  the  application
         form to adequately explain the Appellant's  history  such  that  he
         could affirmatively meet the requirements of Rules V4.1-V4.10.

     13. Discursive grounds of appeal citing a large  volume  of  irrelevant
         authority essentially contended that the reasoning  of  the  First-
         tier  Tribunal  was  unclear.  The  First-tier   Tribunal   refused
         permission to appeal on 14 March 2018; on 29 May 2018 permission to
         appeal was granted by Judge Kebede for the Upper  Tribunal  on  the
         basis that the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeared  to  have  expressed
         conflicting decisions in its conclusions.

     14. Before me Mr Kandola explained that he had discussed  matters  with
         Mr Shah before the hearing and offered the possibility of an agreed
         remittal for re-hearing, given that it was highly arguable that the
         decision was too internally inconsistent to stand. However, Mr Shah
         on instructions declined to accept  that  possibility.  It  was  Mr
         Shah's  submission  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision   was
         perfectly lawful save for the final  lines  where  the  appeal  was
         allowed only in part. That aspect of the decision could be  severed
         from the reasoning overall and  corrected,  in  the  light  of  the
         irresistible inference that the Judge had  intended  to  allow  the
         appeal.

     15. Mr Kandola replied that if the  Upper  Tribunal  found  a  material
         error of law by way of inconsistent reasoning, there would remain a
         need to hear oral evidence  in  the  context  of  a  wholesale  re-
         determination of the case.

Findings and reasons

     16. It will be appreciated that the appeal raised two issues. There was
         the allegation of dishonesty under  the  General  Refusal  reasons,
         because of the decision maker's belief that the Appellant's failure
         to disclose his true immigration history was deceitful.  And  there
         was the further question as to whether the Immigration  Rules  were
         satisfied. These issues were both to be determined in  the  context
         of the proportionality of the immigration decision with  the  right
         to private and family life of the Appellant and his family  in  the
         UK.

     17. Unfortunately, the findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this
         appeal  are  rather  confused.  The  decision  reads  more  like  a
         commentary on the evidence than as an  authoritative  determinative
         of the relevant issues.

     18. The statement at ï¿½33 that the Entry Clearance Officer "was far from
         unjustified" in concluding that the Appellant had not shown that he
         met the requirements of the Visitor Rules indicates that the  Judge
         believed that he was reviewing the decision below on a  rationality
         basis rather than conducting an appeal on the merits.

     19. The Judge identifies flaws in a  number  of  points  taken  by  the
         Secretary of State, but appears to come to no clear conclusion  for
         himself as to whether or  not  the  substance  of  the  Rules  were
         satisfied. Whilst a balanced approach to the evidence is of  course
         appropriate, there is rather too much circumspection without  clear
         conclusions here: there are several passages  where  the  reasoning
         appears to travel in one direction before a  conclusion  that  runs
         contrary to that thinking is stated.

     20. Given these features of the decision, I  cannot  uphold  Mr  Shah's
         submission that it can be rectified by the simple step of  altering
         a few words in the concluding Decision itself. The overall findings
         and reasons are too unclear for that path to be taken.

     21. Accordingly I find that there is a material error  of  law  in  the
         decision below. The matter will have to be re-heard.



Decision:

    The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

    The appeal is remitted for re-hearing in the First-tier Tribunal afresh
    to a Judge other than Judge Bell.

    I draw the attention of the First-tier Tribunal to the desirability  of
    a speedy determination of this appeal given the length  of  time  which
    has passed since the Appellant was first refused a visit visa.



Signed:                                            Date: 31 July 2018
