                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellant with regard to a decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Graham)  promulgated  on  6th  May  2015  by  which  it  dismissed  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Entry Clearance  Officer's  decision  to
    refuse to grant him leave to enter the UK as a partner  under  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules.

 2. In her determination Judge Graham set out the requirements of  appendix
    FM in relation to the relationship requirements, financial requirements
    and English language requirements and then  set  out  the  reasons  for
    refusal by the Entry Clearance Officer. The refusal was  on  the  basis
    that the Appellant did not meet the income requirement or  the  related
    evidential requirements. In this case the Sponsor was required to  have
    a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum and it  was  alleged  that
    the specified documents  contained  in  appendix  FM-SE  had  not  been
    provided. The Entry Clearance Officer noted that although  the  Sponsor
    had submitted personal bank statements, the  credits  seen  within  the
    bank statements did not correspond to the payslips.

 3. Furthermore, the Entry Clearance Officer  carried  out  an  HMRC  check
    which indicated that the Sponsor had not in fact received  any  pay  in
    2013 from her employer.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer  also  noted  that  the  Appellant  had  an
    adverse immigration history which led  him  to  doubt  his  credibility
    generally so that he did not accept any of his statements or  documents
    at face value and so with regard to the English  language  requirements
    the Entry Clearance Officer was also not satisfied that  they  reliably
    demonstrated that the Appellant had passed the stated qualifications.

 5. The Judge then set out the evidence that was before her. She heard oral
    evidence from the Sponsor who was at a loss to explain  the  conclusion
    of the document verification report of 2nd March 2014. As a  result  of
    that she herself had  contacted  HMRC  and  they  produced  her  salary
    history which was contained in the  bundle  showing  no  break  in  her
    earnings.

 6. The Sponsor was paid cash rather than through a bank  and  it  was  not
    always possible to pay the money into the bank in the same week as  she
    was paid and sometimes she paid in two weeks' salary  at  a  time.  She
    occasionally received some of her wages directly into the bank but  she
    also received cash.  Before the First-tier  Tribunal  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer acknowledged that the  bank  statements  showed  her
    exact salary being paid into the bank now but that did not appear to be
    the case previously.  However it was accepted  that  the  earlier  bank
    statements referred to in the refusal had not been provided.

 7. With regard to the English language test  it  was  explained  that  the
    Appellant had retaken the test and that there had been a delay  in  him
    being given a date but he had passed the test in June 2014.

 8. The Sponsor was unaware of the Appellant's previous adverse immigration
    history. She now has a child aged two years and three months  with  her
    husband. She gave evidence that she keeps in regular contact  with  her
    husband and the appeal was also based on Article 8 grounds.

 9. The Judge then set out findings of credibility in fact. In relation  to
    the  specified  evidence  that  Judge  referred  herself  to  paragraph
    12A(a)(iii) of Appendix FM-SE.

10. She then considered the document verification report and on  the  basis
    of the more recent evidence direct from HMRC  was  satisfied  that  the
    Sponsor   did in fact earn �18,984 gross for the financial year 2013/14
    and thus met the financial requirements of Appendix FM.

11. The judge also looked to  the  English  language  certificate  and  was
    satisfied that the Appellant satisfied the provisions of Appendix FM in
    regard. The sole reason for dismissing the appeal under Appendix FM was
    the failure  to  provide  the  evidence  specified  in  Appendix  FM-SE
    paragraph 12A(a)(iii).

12. The judge then considered Article 8 and dismissed the appeal.

13. The grounds seeking permission to  appeal  argue  that  the  judge  had
    erroneously considered paragraph 12A(a)(iii) of Appendix FM-SE as  they
    had no application in applications such as this  and  the  requirements
    are those contained in paragraph 2(a).

14. The Secretary of State in response to permission being granted on  that
    basis argued that in any event the Appellant could not win because  the
    English language test was not submitted at the time of the application.

15. Before me Mr Kotas withdrew that argument on the basis that the English
    language test was retaken as a result of an offer to do so  being  made
    by Entry Clearance Officer. The  Appellant  had  passed  the  test  and
    therefore that requirement of the Rules was met.

16. With regard to the incorrect part of appendix FM-SE being considered he
    accepted that the Judge had considered the  wrong  requirement  in  the
    Rules but that Appendix FM-SE paragraph 2 required  both  payslips  for
    six months prior to the date of  the  application  and  "personal  bank
    statements  corresponding  to  the  same  period  as  the  payslips  at
    paragraph 2 (a), showing that the salary has been paid into an  account
    in the name of the person or in  the  name  of  the  person  and  their
    partner jointly."

17. It was accepted specifically by  the  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer
    before the First-tier Tribunal and by Mr Kotas that the totality of the
    Sponsor's earnings was indeed paid into her bank account  and  appeared
    on the statements. However, he  argued  that  that  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules because the requirements are that  it  should
    "correspond to the same periods" meant that if paid weekly in cash then
    the money is to be paid into  the  bank  weekly,  whereas  it  was  the
    Sponsor's case that sometimes she paid in two weeks' wages at a time. I
    reject that interpretation of the requirements of the Rules.  It  seems
    clear to me that where the Rules require payslips covering a period  of
    six months prior to the date of application and then  require  personal
    bank statements corresponding to the same periods as the payslips  that
    is requiring bank statements covering a period of six months  prior  to
    the date of application. It does not require that the salary has to  be
    paid in on any given date in relation to the payment of the salary  and
    provided all of the salary is paid into  the  account  I  find  that  a
    Sponsor meets the requirements of the Rules.  There  may  be  occasions
    when that does not satisfy the Rules,  for  example  where  six  months
    worth of salary is  paid  in  in  the  last  of  the  six  months  bank
    statements.  That would lack credibility, but in the  circumstances  of
    this case I find it does satisfy the Rule.

18. On the basis that the Judge erred in  applying  the  wrong  section  of
    Appendix FM-SE in her deliberations, I set aside her decision.  In  re-
    deciding  the  appeal  it  is  clear  the  Appellant  does   meet   the
    requirements of appendix FM for entry clearance as a  partner  and  the
    appeal is allowed under the Rules.

19. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.
