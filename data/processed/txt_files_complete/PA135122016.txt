                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Ms N Loughran, of Loughran & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Hands, promulgated on 23 January 2017, dismissing  his  appeal  against
    refusal of asylum.

 2. The grounds are set out in 11 paragraphs, each probing  for  errors  in
    the resolution of the facts.

 3. Permission was granted on the view that arguably the Judge did not take
    account of evidence of the  appellant's  family  involvement  with  the
    KDPI, and took an incorrect  approach  to  the  source  of  potentially
    corroborative evidence from the KDPI in the UK.

 4. The first ground contrasts ï¿½36 of  the  decision,  "Firstly,  for  four
    peshmerga to walk into a  village,  and  for  everyone  to  attend  the
    mosque" with the appellant's evidence, "... most of the people  in  the
    village went to see [the peshmerga]".

 5.  The  second  ground  criticises  the  finding  that  the   appellant's
    involvement was not very likely to have started through  that  meeting,
    by stressing the appellant's  evidence  of  family  history  and  other
    reasons for involvement.

 6. Ms Loughran submitted that there was an overall lack  of  consideration
    of the appellant's background of links through extended family and  his
    village environment to the KDPI, and that the Judge  wrongly  took  one
    incident as the only claimed trigger for his becoming involved.

 7. Mrs O'Brien conceded that the grounds  disclosed  error  in  the  fact-
    finding analysis, such that the decision could not safely stand.

 8. The following outcome was agreed.

 9. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

10. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

11. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Hands.

12. An anonymity direction was made in the FtT.  It is not clear that there
    is any need for one, but the matter was not addressed  in  the  UT,  so
    anonymity is maintained herein.
