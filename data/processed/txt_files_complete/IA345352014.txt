                    (Buckingham Palace Road)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In this decision the Appellant is  referred  to  as  the  Secretary  of
    State and the Respondent as the Claimant.  The Claimant, a national  of
    India, date of birth 14 August 1977, appealed against the Secretary  of
    State's decision, dated 20 August 2014, to  refuse  to  vary  leave  to
    remain  and  to  make  removal  directions  under  Section  47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   The Reasons for Refusal Letter set out at its heart  the  grounds  with
    reference to Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules  HC  395  why  the
    Claimant  had  not  submitted  specified  evidence  as  required  under
    Appendix FM.  Those principal elements required in  specified  evidence
    were:- first, the Claimant (applicant) had the necessary  gross  annual
    income  in  combination  with  specified  savings.  In   refusing   the
    application the Secretary of State said as follows:-

         "E-LTRP.3.1. The applicant must provide  specified  evidence,  from
         the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of-

         (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-

         (i) �18,600; (ii) an additional �3,800 for  the  first  child;  and
         (iii) an additional �2,400 for each additional child; alone  or  in
         combination with

         (b) specified savings of-

         (i) �16,000; and (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to
         2.5 times the amount which is  the  difference  between  the  gross
         annual income from the sources listed in paragraph  E-LTRP.3.2.(a)-
         (f) and the total amount required under  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.1.(a);
         or (c) the requirements in paragraph E-LTRP.3.3.being  met,  unless
         paragraph EX.1. applies.

         In your case, you are required to  demonstrate  that  you  meet  an
         income threshold of �18,600 per annum. You have  claimed  that  you
         meet this through the salary and savings of your partner.

         In the first instance you have claimed  in  your  application  form
         that you partner has earned �11,647.17 through his employment  with
         Asda. While you have provided wage slips for  this  employment  for
         the period of the 04 May 2013 to the 08  March  2014  (a  10  month
         period) you have failed to provide either an employer's  letter  or
         bank statements to show these earnings being paid into his account.
          Appendix FM-SE paragraphs 2(b) and 2(c) make it clear  that  these
         documents are mandatory in determining whether an individual  meets
         the income threshold. Therefore from the outset,  your  application
         falls for refusal as you  have  failed  to  provide  the  specified
         evidence to confirm your partner's earnings.

         However, even if this were not the case and we were  to  take  into
         account the earnings as  evidenced  by  the  wage  slips  you  have
         provided for your partner you would still fail to meet the required
         threshold of �18,600. As stated, you have3 provided wage slips  for
         your  partner  covering  the  10  month  period   prior   to   your
         application. When added together, the wages your  partner  received
         for his employment were �11,635.92 for that 10 month  period.  This
         equates to an annual salary of:-

             �11,635.92/10 x 12 = �13,963.10

         This salary  is  therefore  significantly  short  of  the  required
         �18,600 income threshold you are  required  to  meet,  specifically
         �4,636.90. Your partner's wages are therefore  below  the  required
         threshold.

         You have further stated that your partner has savings in the United
         Kingdom and that these should be used to meet any shortfall in  the
         required income threshold. As evidence of this  however,  all  that
         has been provided is a copy of a Halifax  passbook  which  has  not
         been certified by the issuing bank, but by  your  partner  himself.
         Therefore this  document  to  is  not  acceptable  as  evidence  of
         savings.  However, even if your partner's savings were  taken  into
         account you would still fail  to  meet  the  aforementioned  income
         threshold of �18,600.

         As can be seen from paragraph E-LTRP.3.1.(b)(i) and  (ii)  you  are
         required to demonstrate savings  of  �16,000  plus  2.5  times  the
         difference between your salary and the  required  income.  In  your
         case the difference was �4,636.90 which would make the savings  you
         require:-

             �16,000 + (2.5 x (�18,600 - �13,963.10)

             �16,000 + (2.5 x 4636.90)

             �16,000 + �11,592.25 = �27,592.25

         Further to this, the amount of savings you are  relying  upon  must
         have been held by you for the period  of  6  months  prior  to  the
         application. In your case, your partner's savings show a balance as
         low as �15,800 as of the 18 October 2013 and therefore this is  the
         total amount of savings your  partner  has  demonstrated.  This  is
         again well below the required savings of �27,592.25 you would  need
         to demonstrate to meet the income threshold of �18,600.

         In view of the above the Secretary of State is not  satisfied  that
         you can meet the requirements of R-LTRP 1.1 (c), as  stated  above,
         for leave under the 5 year route to settlement and your application
         is refused under D-LTRP 1.3. with reference to R-LTRP 1.1. (c).

         In refusing your application consideration has been given  to  your
         family life under Article 8 which from 09  July  2012  falls  under
         Appendix FM EX.1. of the  rules.  The  transitional  provisions  in
         paragraph  A277C  state  that  an  applicant  must  meet  all   the
         requirements of R-LTRP 1.1 (a), (b) & (d) in  order  for  EX.1.  to
         apply."

3.    In  addition  the  Secretary  of  State  went  on  to   consider   the
    requirements that might arise under Appendix FM: EX1 and EX2  but  also
    private life considerations with reference to paragraph 276ADE  of  the
    immigration rules and a general consideration  of  whether  there  were
    exceptional circumstances that warranted a consideration of this matter
    either within the rules or without the rules.

4.   The appeal against that decision came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Majid who on 1 May 2015 allowed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
    and it would seem he intended although he  does  not  say  so  to  have
    allowed the appeal with reference to Appendix FM.

5.   Mr Khandelwal  points  to  a  number  of  paragraphs,  which  have  the
    appearance to me of being  standard  paragraphs,  in  which  the  judge
    asserted he has considered the Rules, the law, the application  of  the
    Rules and reached the decision that he did, presumably  with  reference
    to those matters.

6.   Unfortunately, the judge's analysis fails to address a  very  important
    point, namely that in terms of the application  the  financial  picture
    needed to be presented to relate to a  period  of  not  more  than  six
    months before the date of the application.  In this case  the  date  of
    application was 21 March 2014 and thus the relevant period goes back to
    September 2013.  The requirements related both to the provision of  the
    pay slips and the evidence of savings under Appendix FM-SE.

7.   The judge did not address  that  issue  but  rather  took  a  pragmatic
    stance by reference to financial information then in being at the  date
    of the judge's decision.  It is  plain  that  additional  evidence  was
    provided that showed after the date of application and after  the  date
    of decision that the Claimant's Sponsor or the Claimant had  sufficient
    funds in order to meet the general  requirements  for  maintenance  and
    savings.  However the material error the judge made was to relate  that
    later information back to the application.  The judge forgot apparently
    to consider the matter as required under  Appendix  FM.   There  is  no
    argument that later information  provided  informed  on  the  Sponsor's
    savings.  It is not suggested that the Sponsor was acting in bad  faith
    nor indeed was the Claimant.  Rather what appears to have happened  was
    that the information was  not  in  being  as  needed  at  the  date  of
    application.   The  after  arising  material  showed  that  later   the
    Claimant, possibly after the  date  of  decision,  was  in  a  stronger
    financial position than previously.

8.   Regrettably the  analysis  at  paragraphs  15  to  17  of  the  judge's
    decision simply did not get to grips with the required evidence  to  be
    produced.  It may be that the consequences of the rules may  be  harsh.
    I do not make any adverse criticism of the Sponsor or the Claimant  but
    the fact was the required evidence was not there  in the form required.
     In these circumstances I do not find there was any  sustainable  basis
    for the judge allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules  which  I
    understand, on a broad reading of paragraph 17 of the decision, was the
    judge's intention.

9.   Mr Khandelwal has helpfully addressed me on what were factual  matters,
    either at the date of the Secretary of State's decision or at the  date
    of the judge's  decision  but  for  the  afore  going  reasons  however
    sympathetic one may be with the Sponsor and his wife, the fact is  that
    there was no purpose served in  trying  to  avoid  at  this  stage  the
    specific requirements of the Rules which self-evidently  had  not  been
    met.

10.  Accordingly I was minded to find that the Original Tribunal's  decision
    in dealing with this matter and under Appendix FM could not  stand  and
    the matter would have to be remade.

11.  In addition the Sponsor raised the issue of his  wife  and  their  life
    together in the UK.  It is not suggested that they are not in a genuine
    relationship.  I do not venture into the area  as  to  whether  or  not
    Article 8 would be engaged but the fact of  the  matter  is  the  judge
    never dealt with that issue and made no findings on the relationship or
    whether it could be conducted in  the  home  country.   There  were  no
    findings of fact that bear on Article 8 ECHR as an issue.

12.  In the circumstances again bearing in mind the Secretary of  State  did
    consider the issue of private life  considerations  and  whether  there
    were exceptional circumstances to look at the  matter  outside  of  the
    Rules, it seemed to me that were this matter to  be  reconsidered  that
    would be an issue which should also be addressed.

13.  After I had indicated I was minded to find errors of law by the  judge,
    Mr Khandelwal took instructions and his client's wish was that a  fresh
    application should be made.  Therefore  he  wished  to  withdraw  their
    appeal against the Respondent's original decision and to make  a  fresh
    application with the appropriate financial information.

14.  The Claimant's decision to withdraw her appeal must in the  context  of
    an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Secretary of State be  construed
    as a decision to make no further resistance to the Secretary of State's
    appeal which is accordingly allowed and the decision  of  the  Original
    Tribunal is set aside.

15.  Plainly if pursuing that matter at a later date the  Claimant  and  her
    husband wish to press again the issue of Article 8 of the ECHR then  it
    will be open to them to do so.

16.  In remaking the decision, the Claimant's  concession  to  withdraw  her
    appeal is an indication that she  no  longer  seeks  to  challenge  the
    original decision, dated 20 August 2014, of the Secretary of State. The
    Claimant's  appeal  is  accordingly  dismissed  and  no  fee  award  is
    appropriate.

17.  No anonymity order was sought nor is one required.
