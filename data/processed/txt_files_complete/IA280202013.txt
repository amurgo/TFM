Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Hossain, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Aziz who, in a determination promulgated  on
    11 February 2014, allowed the appeal of Mr Sayeed Md  Imran  against  a
    decision of the Secretary of State, who had refused his application for
    leave to remain as an Entrepreneur.  The  appeal  was  allowed  to  the
    limited extent that the matter was remitted back to the respondent, the
    judge having considered that that was the appropriate course of  action
    under paragraph 245AA of the Rules.

 2. Although the appeal before us was that of the  Secretary  of  State  we
    will refer to him in this decision as the respondent  as  she  was  the
    respondent before the First-tier Tribunal.  Similarly, we refer  to  Mr
    Sayeed MD Imran as the appellant as he was  the  appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant was born in 1986.  He came to Britain  as  a  student  in
    2007 and then was granted various extensions of stay as a student,  the
    last until  30  December  2012.   On  12  December  2012  he  made  the
    application as a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur).   That  was  refused  by  the
    Secretary of State on 17 June 2013 the reasons for  the  refusal  being
    set out in a detailed letter of that  date.   It  was  considered  that
    under Appendix A attributes the third party declaration which  had  had
    to be provided did not meet the requirements of the  Rules  because  it
    did not contain both the appellant's signature and that  of  the  third
    party.  In making that decision the Secretary of State  stated  that  a
    decision had been made  not  to  request  additional  documentation  or
    exceptionally  consider  the  application  under  the   provisions   of
    paragraph 245AA as it was not anticipated that addressing the  omission
    or error would lead to a grant of leave.  It was also  considered  that
    the appellant did not have the relevant funds disposable in the  United
    Kingdom and finally that he did not meet the  maintenance  requirements
    of the Rules.  The notice of refusal when referring  to  Appendix  C  -
    'Maintenance' - stated:

         "We have assessed the Maintenance funds requirement for the  period
         14 September 2012 to 7 December 2012.  From the  evidence  provided
         you have not demonstrated that you have that  you  have  maintained
         the minimum level of available funds required throughout this  full
         90 day period, as specified in Appendix C of the Immigration Rules.
          This is because on 3 December 2012 the level  of  available  funds
         fell below �900 to �720.90."

    These were the issues in the appeal when it came before Judge Aziz.

 4. The judge heard evidence from the appellant and then  set  out  various
    findings of fact.  He noted, when considering  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant had accepted that a  signature  had  not  been  on  the  bank
    document from Bangladesh which was required under the Rules.   He  also
    noted that the appellant accepted that the bank statement which he  had
    submitted with his application revealed that on  3  December  2012  the
    funds in his account had fallen below �900.  The judge went  to  on  to
    state in paragraph 29, referring to the balance of 3 December, that:

         "His balance on that day was �720.90.  However, if I were  to  look
         closely at the bank statement and in particular the online  version
         of the statement contained  within  the  appellant's  supplementary
         bundle, then this revealed that on 4 December 2012  (the  following
         day), �600 entered his account.   This  increased  his  balance  to
         �1,319.40.   The  deposit  took  him  above  the  �900   threshold.
         However, he had deposited the �600 the day  before.   It  had  been
         deposited on 3 December 2012."

 5. The judge then referred to the Annual Summary Information which  showed
    that the deposit had been made at 16:49 hours on 3 December  and  noted
    the argument that if he were to take that  into  account  the  document
    showed that the funds had cleared before  the  day  had  finished.   He
    noted however  the  appellant's  acceptance  that  that  had  not  been
    reflected in either version of the Barclay's Bank  statement  which  he
    had submitted.

 6. The judge set out his findings of fact in paragraph 33 onwards  of  the
    determination.  With regard to the third  party  declaration  he  noted
    that it was accepted by the appellant and his representatives that  the
    requirement that both signatures be on the relevant letter had not been
    met.  He went on then to consider the issue of  the  maintenance  funds
    and concluded at paragraph 44:

         "In light of his testimony, I  find  that  he  only  submitted  one
         Barclays  Bank  statement,   the   statement   contained   in   the
         respondent's bundle, which reveals that had not held at least  �900
         for 90 days during the qualifying period.  Therefore, even  if  the
         Barclays Bank statement at page 23 of the  appellant's  bundle  was
         legible, I would have been prevented from considering it by  virtue
         of Section 19 of the UK Borders Act 2007."

    I pause there to note that  the  judge  had  before  him  a  bundle  of
    documents which did include a savings account with  approximately  �223
    in it at the relevant time but the judge found that that had  not  been
    submitted with the application.

 7. The judge also said in paragraph 46 of the determination that:

         "The appellant relies upon an extract from a document from Barclays
         Bank  called  the  "Annual  Summary  Information"  to  support  his
         position.  There are a  number  of  problems  with  this  document.
         Firstly, I am prevented from considering it by virtue of Section 19
         of the UK Borders Act 2007.  Secondly, even if  I  am  entitled  to
         look at the document, on a strict reading it reveals that prior  to
         the deposit of �600 on the afternoon of 3 December 2012,  that  the
         appellant must have held, even if only for a few hours, funds below
         �900.  Finally, the simple fact is that the Barclays Bank statement
         which he submitted shows that on 3 December  2012  he  had  cleared
         funds of �720.90.  The Tribunal is not prepared to  go  behind  the
         figure recorded in his own bank statement."

 8. The judge then in paragraphs 47 onwards considered what he referred  to
    as "remittal under paragraph 245AA".  He considered  the  issue  before
    him was whether the appellant should have been contacted so he be given
    an opportunity to submit a bank letter and third party  declaration  in
    the correct format and produce evidence of other funds  that  he  might
    hold to demonstrate that he could  meet  the  maintenance  requirements
    such as funds held in a second Barclays Bank account.   He  stated  the
    key question for the Tribunal in this  appeal  is  whether  the  matter
    ought to be remitted back to the respondent under paragraph 245AA.

 9. He then went on in paragraphs 48 and 49 to state:

         "Whilst the appellant did not do himself any  favours  by  provided
         contradictory  evidence  in  respect  of  how  many  Barclays  Bank
         statements he  submitted  with  his  application,  looking  at  the
         evidence in the round,  I  find  that  the  issues  raised  by  the
         respondent in respect of the bank letter,  third-party  declaration
         and the Barclays Bank statement were omissions which the  appellant
         should have been given an opportunity to address.  Given the nature
         of the errors I find that he may well have been in  a  position  to
         rectify the mistakes had he been approached.

    He then stated:

         "The appellant's appeal is therefore allowed under paragraph  245AA
         to the extent that it is remitted back to the respondent  for  them
         to provide the appellant with an opportunity to submit evidence  in
         the proper format as per paragraph 41-SD  of  Appendix  FM  of  the
         Immigration Rules to demonstrate  that  he  is  able  to  meet  the
         requirements of Appendix A and Appendix C of the Rules".

    He therefore concluded that he should allow the appeal  to  the  extent
    that  the  matter  would  be  remitted  back  to  the  respondent   for
    consideration.

10. In paragraph  9  of  the  determination  the  judge  had  set  out  the
    provisions of paragraph 245AA.  That is the paragraph dealing with what
    was at one time referred to as the evidential flexibility  policy.   It
    states that where specified documents should be provided the  Secretary
    of State will only consider documents to have been submitted  with  the
    application and would  only  consider  documents  submitted  after  the
    application when they have been submitted in  accordance  with  certain
    requirements.  Those were where some of the  documents  in  a  sequence
    have been omitted, the example being given if one bank statement from a
    series is missing or a document is in a wrong format, for example if  a
    letter is not on the letterhead paper specified, or  if  documents  are
    copies and not original documents or that a document  did  not  contain
    all the specified information.

11.  The  Secretary  of  State  appealed,  arguing  that  the   judge   had
    misinterpreted the terms of paragraph 245AA of the Rules.  The  grounds
    stated that the bank statement submitted  to  show  maintenance  was  a
    complete document.  It was submitted that there was no reason  for  the
    Secretary of State to have known that there was a second bank  account.
    It was submitted that there was no requirement  for  the  Secretary  of
    State to request further evidence regarding the appellant's finances to
    gain 10 points under Appendix C.  It is submitted that the Secretary of
    State was correct to refuse  the  appellant's  application  under  that
    Appendix.

12. At the hearing before us Mr Walker relied on the grounds of appeal.  Mr
    Hossain referring to the bundle of documents before  the  judge  argued
    that the further sum in the second statement was  relevant  and  should
    have been taken into account.  He also referred us to  a  determination
    of the Upper Tribunal in the case of  NA  (Tier  1  post-study  work  -
    funds) [2009] UKAIT 00025.

13.  We  have  found  that  there  are  material  errors  of  law  in   the
    determination of the Tribunal.  The reality is  that  the  judge  quite
    correctly made findings  in  paragraphs  33  onwards,  particularly  in
    paragraphs 40 and 42 onwards, that the second bank  statement  had  not
    been  before  the  decision-maker,  had  not  been  put  in  with   the
    application  and  therefore  could  not  be  taken  into  account   and
    furthermore that the amount in the appellant's account had dipped below
    the required  �900.   We  have  concluded  that  having  reached  those
    findings the judge should have dismissed the appeal.  As we have  said,
    the judge went on to consider the issue  of  remittal  under  paragraph
    245AA.  However, there is no  basis  on  which  that  would  have  been
    appropriate.  There was no document  which  was  one  of  a  series  of
    documents which was missing.  The requirements of that Rule were simply
    not met.  There was therefore no basis on which the  judge  could  have
    correctly decided this case should  have  been  remitted  back  to  the
    respondent.

14.  For these reasons we have decided that it is appropriate to set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Judge and as the requisite evidence  was
    not before the Secretary of State we conclude that the appeal should be
    dismissed.

Decision

This appeal is dismissed.
