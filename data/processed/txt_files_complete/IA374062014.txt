For the Respondent:    Ms Z. Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Vietnam date of birth 30th October 1979.
      She appeals with permission the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Jackson)  to dismiss her appeal against a refusal to  grant  her
    leave to remain on human rights grounds and  to  remove  her  from  the
    United Kingdom pursuant to s10 of the Immigration and Asylum act 1999.


 2. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in September 2004 with a  work
    permit.  By  September  of  the  following  year  she  had  become   an
    overstayer.  A  number  of  unsuccessful  attempts  to  regularise  her
    immigration status followed, culminating in the  Respondent's  decision
    of the 2nd September 2014 which was the subject of  the  appeal  before
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. It was the Appellant's case that  she  had  established  an  Article  8
    family life in the years that she had spent in this  country.  She  was
    married to a Mr Tran, a British national who  lived  and  worked  here.
    Although he agreed that if had to, he would return to Vietnam  to  live
    with his wife, she submitted that it would be  unreasonable  to  expect
    him to go to live in Vietnam. Although  he  was  originally  from  that
    country, he had not  been  there  since  1966,  had  a  home,  job  and
    established private life  here  and  more  importantly  retained  close
    contact with his daughter, a university student.  Although his daughter
    was now an adult she was extremely close to her father, in part due  to
    the untimely death of her mother when she was  a  young  girl,  and  it
    would be disproportionate to interfere with that relationship.

 4.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  without  reservation  that   the
    Appellant and Mr Tran are in a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.
    They were married in 2014.  There would be an interference if she  were
    to be removed, and so Article 8 was engaged.   The  interference  would
    however be very limited, since on his own evidence Mr Tran was prepared
    to go to Vietnam to live with her. They could maintain contact with his
    daughter through modern  means  of  communication.   Having  regard  to
    proportionality the Tribunal directed itself to consider s117B  of  the
    Nationality Immigration and asylum Act 2002. It found that the couple's
    relocation to Vietnam "may involve some inconvenience for  him  but  he
    did not state at any time that there would be obstacles to him doing so
    or that it would be unduly harsh to do so".

 5. The Appellant now appeals on the grounds that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in importing into its assessment the test of "unduly harsh" which
    appears only in the deportation provisions, and in failing to conduct a
    holistic evaluation of proportionality, having regard in particular  to
    Mr Tran's relationship with his daughter.   It  was  further  submitted
    that the Tribunal erred in failing to apply the "Chikwamba principle".







    Error of Law: My Findings

 6. There is no merit in the argument that this appeal could or should have
    been allowed applying the "Chikwamba principle".  First of  all,  there
    were no findings to the effect that the Appellant met the  requirements
    in Appendix FM relating to entry clearance as a spouse. At paragraph 33
    the determination states that with his two jobs "it is  possible"  that
    Mr Tran earns more than ï¿½18,600. Mr Sayadyan  further  pointed  to  the
    finding at 49 that the Appellant is not a burden on the state since she
    is supported by her husband.  With respect, neither of  those  findings
    come  anywhere  close  to  establishing  that  the  very   prescriptive
    requirements in FM are met. Even if Mr Tran  earns  in  excess  of  the
    minimum income threshold was no reference to the  'specified  evidence'
    that he would be required  to  produce,  nor  to  whether  the  English
    language test certificate had been produced.  Secondly, applying R  (on
    the application of Chen) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC) it  would  be  for
    the Appellant to demonstrate that the temporary interference caused  by
    her short return to Vietnam would be disproportionate.   In order to do
    that Mr  Sayadyan  pointed  to  Mr  Tran's  employment,  his  home  and
    relationship with his daughter. None of that was capable of showing  it
    to be disproportionate for her to return to her home country  in  order
    to make an application for entry clearance. The  process  would  be  no
    doubt frustrating, expensive and inconvenient, but those factors  would
    not necessarily render it disproportionate.


 7. The nub of the Appellant's case was that the Judge was  wrong  to  have
    used the phrase "unduly harsh" at paragraph 50. In this  the  Appellant
    is quite right. I am not however satisfied that this error  is  in  any
    way material.

 8. The proper approach was for the Tribunal to first consider whether  the
    Appellant met the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM.  Since  she  was  an
    overstayer, and had not produced the specified evidence as  to  income,
    this would have meant reliance on the exception at EX.1:

         EX.1. This paragraph applies if
         ....
         (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK
 9. Before me Mr Sayadyan argued that the test  "insurmountable  obstacles"
    no longer had any validity since it had been  declared  unlawful  on  a
    number of occasions by the higher courts. He then explained  that  what
    he meant by that was that it had been found that it  was  a  test  that
    should not be interpreted in  an  unrealistically  high  way:  see  for
    instance Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules- correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
    640 (IAC). In this he is correct.  It remains however a stringent test:
    see for instance paragraph 21 of Agyarko & Ors  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  440.
    The Rules themselves now provide further elaboration if it were  needed
    as to what it might mean. EX.2 reads:


         EX.2. For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which would be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family
         life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or
         would entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their
         partner.
10. This then was the hurdle that the Appellant had  to  get  over  if  she
    stood any prospects of success  under  the  Rules.  The  "very  serious
    hardship" relied upon by Mr Sayadyan was the very long-standing private
    and family life enjoyed by Mr Tran in the UK, his relationship with his
    daughter and the fact that he is employed here.   I am  satisfied  that
    the First-tier Tribunal had regard to all of those  factors.  The  high
    point of the Appellant's case is the fact that her  stepdaughter  would
    be  left  alone  in  the  UK  whilst  she  was  at  university.  It  is
    understandable that the family are reluctant to do that,  but  for  the
    reasons set out at paragraphs 47 and  50  of  the  determination,   the
    sadness that they might endure as a result of that physical  separation
    did not cross the threshold to show compliance with EX.1.   In  Agyarko
    Court of Appeal expressly rejected the submission that an  upheaval  of
    the kind feared by Mr Tran - leaving his job,  home  and  other  family
    members - would constitute insurmountable obstacles [25].


11. What was left was for the Tribunal to consider Article 8, which it did.
    Central to its reasoning was the fact that Mr Tran had conceded, albeit
    reluctantly, that he would go and live in Vietnam with  his  wife.   Mr
    Sayadyan submitted that the Tribunal failed  to  consider  all  of  the
    relevant factors (outlined above) and that had it  done  so,  it  would
    have found that it was not reasonable for Mr Tran to have  to  live  in
    Vietnam; indeed it is submitted at paragraph 21 that any other  outcome
    would  have  been  perverse.  That  submission  is   to   fundamentally
    misunderstand the current state of the law in respect of Article 8. The
    Appellant is an overstayer who cannot bring herself within  the  Rules.
    Whilst Appendix FM does not constitute a 'complete code' and  there  is
    room to consider Article 8 along classic Razgar lines, the gap  between
    EX.1 and Article 8 is small: see for instance SSHD v SS (Congo)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387, R (on the application of Nagre) v SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin) and Agyarko.     In the absence of some particular  feature  of
    the evidence it was not perverse for the Tribunal to have concluded  as
    it did that there was no breach of Article 8.









      Decisions


12. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains no error  of  law
    and it is upheld.


13. I was not asked to make a direction for anonymity and on  the  facts  I
    see no reason to do so.
