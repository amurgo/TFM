Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Bandegani, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant has been granted permission to  appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Courtney dismissing his  appeal  against  the
    refusal of the respondent to grant him asylum in the UK.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan, who  claimed  to  have  been
    born on 1 January 2000.  He was given a  deemed  date  of  birth  of  7
    September 1998.  He made a clandestine entry into the UK on 8 September
    2015 and claimed asylum on 9 October 2015.  His application was refused
    on 12 May 2017.  He gave notice of appeal against the  decision  on  23
    May 2017.  In a decision promulgated  on  4  December  2017  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Wright allowed the appeal  but  this  decision  was  set
    aside in its entirety by the Upper Tribunal on 25 February  2018.   The
    matter was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh  hearing  on
    the merits on all issues.

3.   Judge Courtney heard the appellant's appeal  on  20  March  2019.   She
    heard oral evidence in Dari by the appellant  and  in  English  by  his
    witness Ms Jo Weston.

4.   At the end of  the  hearing  the  judge  reserved  her  decision.   The
    judge's decision and reasons was promulgated on 8 April 2019.

5.   At this stage it is pertinent to quote from paragraph 6 of the  judge's
    decision as follows:

         "6.   In  a  letter   dated   21   March   2019   the   Appellant's
             representatives  sought  permission  to  serve  "post  hearing
             submissions on the developments of the appeal of AS (Safety of
             Kabul)  Afghanistan  CG  [2018]  UKUT  00118  (IAC)   once   a
             determination has been published".  They stated that they  had
             been informed by junior counsel that the decision in AS  would
             be set aside.  He had advised them that "The Court has not yet
             heard full  submissions  on  relief,  or  given  judgment,  on
             whether and if so which parts  of  the  CG  can  stand."   The
             Appellant's representatives informed me  that  at  this  stage
             they were not in a position to estimate  when  publication  of
             the judgment would take place.  That in itself would  militate
             against postponing the promulgation  of  a  decision  in  this
             matter, since  it  would  require  a  delay  of  indeterminate
             length.  In any event, as will be seen from my findings as set
             out at paragraph 46 below there is no  need  for  Mr  Safi  to
             relocate to Kabul, so the findings in  AS  do  not  come  into
             play.  The country guidance in AK (Article  15(c)  Afghanistan
             CG [2012] UKUT 163 (IAC) in relation to Article 15(c)  of  the
             Qualification Directive was unaffected by the decision in AS."

6.   The appellant's claim is that he was born in Sherkheil  village,  Tagab
    District, Kapisa Province in Afghanistan and is of Tajik ethnic origin.
     He claimed to be at real risk of being persecuted  on  return  on  the
    basis of his imputed political opinion.

7.   He claimed that his father ABS was a high-ranking police  commander  or
    alternatively a  commander  in  the  pro-government  Arbaki,  a  tribal
    security system, who was involved in fighting against the Taliban.   He
    used to be away from home for months  at  a  time.   In  May  2015  the
    appellant's father's bodyguards informed his mother  that  her  husband
    had been abducted from his post by the Taliban.  Ten  days  after  this
    they told her that he had been killed.  A few days  later  the  Taliban
    came to the house looking for the appellant,  but  he  evaded  them  by
    hiding in the bathroom.  They returned a second time four or five  days
    later and searched the house, but the appellant was at the mosque.  His
    mother told him that the Taliban had threatened his life.

8.   Two days later the appellant's mother told him to go to  the  house  of
    his maternal uncle RGS which was situated in the bazaar of Tamir, about
    30 minutes away by car.  A few days later the appellant was handed over
    to an agent.  He left Afghanistan in June 2015  and  travelled  through
    Turkey, Hungary and France before arriving in the  UK  on  8  September
    2015.

9.   The judge noted that the  appellant  sought  judicial  review  of  Kent
    County Council's assessment made on 21 January 2016 that  his  date  of
    birth was 7 September 1998.  However in June 2017  the  Upper  Tribunal
    found that on the balance of probabilities, this  was  the  appellant's
    actual date of birth.  The judge said she had read  the  UT's  decision
    and saw no reason to depart from its conclusions.  She found that as at
    the date of the hearing the appellant was 20 years and 6  months'  old.
    Even on his own estimation the appellant was now 19  and  no  longer  a
    minor.  The judge said that in making an assessment of the  appellant's
    evidence as to the events that preceded his departure from Afghanistan,
    she had made due allowance for the fact that he was only  17  years  of
    age when he left the country.

10.  The judge noted that in his witness statement of 20 October  2017,  the
    appellant said he had problems concentrating and understanding  exactly
    what was being asked of him.  He said he was asked too  many  questions
    and became very confused.  He had never been to school  and  had  never
    been asked so many questions like this.  In general  he  did  not  feel
    mentally well.  The judge noted that there was  no  psychiatric  report
    submitted to corroborate these claims.

11.   The  judge  also  noted  that  the  appellant   denied   having   been
    fingerprinted in Hungary which his representative ascribed to the  fact
    that he "clearly struggled to recall significant events  that  occurred
    before he arrived in the UK".  The judge held that this  could  equally
    well have been a deliberate attempt at concealment.   Having  lived  in
    the "jungle" outside Calais for a month, the judge  thought  it  likely
    that he  would  have  been  aware  that  a  prior  encounter  with  the
    authorities of a safe country  could  damage  his  prospects  of  being
    granted asylum in the UK.

12.   The  judge  proceeded  to  consider  the  credibility  issues  in  the
    appellant's claim.   She  held  that  at  the  time  of  the  screening
    interview on 26 January 2016 the appellant was 17  years  of  age.   He
    made no mention of his father's death or of  being  threatened  by  the
    Taliban during that interview.  Asked what was his reason for coming to
    the UK he replied "there is war  and  fighting  in  my  area"  [SCR  IV
    paragraph 4.1].  Taxed with  this  omission  in  cross-examination  the
    appellant said "they asked me to explain briefly".  It was put  to  him
    that he had been asked if he was afraid that something bad would happen
    if he returned home and had said only that "my life is at risk  due  to
    the war".  [SCR IV paragraph 4.2].  Ms Hall, the HOPO, asked why he had
    made no mention of the Taliban.  The appellant said "I was  asked  what
    would happen to me if I go back and I said I'd be killed.  They  didn't
    ask me about my father or anything else".   The  HOPO  objected  "quite
    rightly, in the judge's opinion  that  it  was  he  who  possessed  the
    information, not the interviewing officer, to which he responded  "they
    said I'd have the opportunity to explain my case in detail, I was  only
    telling them briefly".  In the judge's judgment, the assertion that his
    father had been killed by the Taliban was a fundamental aspect  of  the
    appellant's claim and would have been mentioned  at  the  outset.   The
    fact that it was not  was  indicative  of  an  account  that  had  been
    augmented to bolster his prospects of success.

13.  The  judge  considered  the  skeleton  argument  by  Ms  O'Reilley  the
    appellant's representative that  the  inconsistencies  alleged  by  the
    respondent were not inconsistencies.  Ms O'Reilley  contended  that  it
    was unreasonable to expect the appellant to be  able  to  give  precise
    numbers and dates at  the  time  of  his  asylum  interview  (conducted
    nineteen months after his arrival in the UK) which matched exactly what
    he had said in his witness  statement.   Ms  O'Reilley  cited  the  IDI
    Processing an asylum application from a  child  which  highlighted  the
    need to take account of a child's age and maturity, mental or emotional
    trauma experienced by the child; education level; fear of  mistrust  of
    authorities; feelings of shame; and painful memories.  The  judge  said
    she noted that at the time of his asylum interview on 27th April  2017,
    the appellant was 18� years old and no longer technically a child.

14.  The judge noted that when asked during  his  substantive  interview  if
    his father was in charge  of  people,  the  appellant  replied  in  the
    affirmative and estimated  the  numbers  at  between  10  and  20  men.
    However in his witness statement of 17 February 2016 he stated that his
    father had 30 to 40 people working under him.  In his witness statement
    of 20 October 2017 the appellant said he never asked his father  so  he
    was guessing.  The judge found that there was a significant discrepancy
    in the figures and in her view  this  was  indicative  of  an  invented
    account.

15.  The judge also noted that there was a discrepancy as to the  number  of
    times the bodyguard had come to the house to  share  the  news  of  his
    father's demise.  The judge held that the appellant had  not  proffered
    an  explanation  for  his  inconsistency  over  whether  his   father's
    bodyguards would accompany him home and then leave or stay  to  protect
    him.  He had not explained why he referred to one single  bodyguard  in
    his witness statement but at interview said that he  did  not  see  the
    bodyguards and so did not know if it was just one man who came  to  the
    house.

16.  The judge said she did  not  expect  the  appellant's  evidence  to  be
    completely consistent and recognised that each retelling  of  an  event
    can vary given the  passage  of  time,  the  use  of  interpreters  and
    imperfect recall.  She also appreciated the pitfalls  of  over-reliance
    on small discrepancies which may arise from nuances.  Having said that,
    she did not consider that the discrepancies identified in  the  refusal
    letter were minor ones.

17.  The judge held that despite the fact that  the  appellant  claimed  his
    father was a senior police commander, or alternatively a  commander  in
    the pro-government Arbaki, his family appears to have made  no  attempt
    to seek protection when he was allegedly  threatened  by  the  Taliban.
    The judge said this would have been the logical  first  port  of  call,
    rather than immediately despatching a teenager on a  hazardous  journey
    to a foreign country.  The judge held that the appellant's  failure  to
    seek help from the Afghan authorities undermined the credibility of his
    claim.

18.  The judge found it implausible that  the  Taliban  would  overlook  the
    bathroom when conducting a search of the premises on the first occasion
    they came looking  for  him.   The  judge  found  merit  in  Ms  Hall's
    submission that it was impossible that  the  appellant's  family  would
    allow him to continue his normal routine by continuing  to  attend  the
    mosque if the Taliban were in search of him.

19.  The judge found that the appellant's account of what  happened  to  him
    in Afghanistan was lacking in credibility.  She did not  consider  that
    it has been shown to the requisite  low  standard  of  proof  that  the
    appellant has been targeted by the Taliban  and  will  be  at  risk  of
    harassment or violence on return.

20.  The judge found  that  the  appellant  was  not  at  risk  of  forcible
    recruitment by the Taliban.  She relied on the country guidance  of  HK
    and Others (minors - indiscriminate violence -  forced  recruitment  by
    Taliban - contact with family members) Afghanistan CG [2010]  UKUT  378
    (IAC).

21.  In the light of her conclusions at paragraphs  41  and  42,  the  judge
    found that there were no substantial grounds  for  believing  that  the
    appellant was in need of protection for a Convention reason against ill-
    treatment  at  the  hands   of   non-state   actors   in   Afghanistan.
    Furthermore, the appellant was not a person whose return to his country
    of origin would violate his protected human rights under Article  3  of
    the ECHR.

22.  In the light of her rejection of his asylum claim, the judge held  that
    the appellant's  claim  for  humanitarian  protection  depends  on  him
    establishing that there is a reasonable degree of likelihood a  serious
    threat to his civilian life by reason of  indiscriminate  violence  and
    that there is no alternative to  international  protection  by  way  of
    relocation to a part of the country of origin where there  is  no  real
    risk of suffering serious harm and where the applicant  can  reasonably
    be expected to stay.

23.  The judge relied on AK  (Article  15(c))  Afghanistan  CG  [2012]  UKUT
    00163 IAC in which the Tribunal found that despite a rise in the number
    of civilian deaths and casualties, and an expansion of the geographical
    scope of the armed conflict in Afghanistan, the level of indiscriminate
    violence taken as a whole had not reached such a high level as to  mean
    that a civilian, solely by being present in the country  faced  a  real
    risk which threatened his life or person.  The judge  stated  that  the
    relevant Practice Direction  states  that  determinations  bearing  the
    letters CG shall be treated as an authoritative finding  on  the  issue
    identified in the determination.  She said AK Afghanistan is a decision
    which ought to be followed unless there is  later  background  material
    which undermines it.  The judge  considered  the  following  background
    material:

         "50. Ms O'Reilly highlighted the UNHCR Eligibility  Guidelines  (30
             August 2018) which stated  that  "The  security  situation  in
             Afghanistan remains volatile,  with  civilians  continuing  to
             bear the brunt of the conflict..... The conflict continues  to
             affect all parts of  the  country.    Since  the  Government's
             decision to defend  population  centres  and  strategic  rural
             areas, fighting between AGEs and  the  Afghan  government  has
             intensified.   AGEs  are  reported  to  have  engaged  in   an
             increasing number of attacks deliberately targeting civilians,
             particularly suicide improvised explosive  devices  (IED)  and
             complex attacks.  AGEs improvised explosive devices (IED)  and
             complex attacks.   AGEs  continue  to  carry  out  large-scale
             attacks in Kabul and other cities, and  to  consolidate  their
             control across rural  areas.   Concerns  have  been  expressed
             about the ANDSF's capability  and  effectiveness  in  ensuring
             security and stability across Afghanistan" [AB page 127].   Ms
             O'Reilly also drew my attention to a UNAMA press release dated
             24 February 2019 which stated that "More civilians were killed
             in the Afghan conflict  last  year  than  at  any  time  since
             records have been kept", documenting 3,804 civilian deaths  in
             2018 [AB page 67].  In their report  UNAMA  "acknowledges  the
             efforts  taken  by  the  Afghan  national   security   forces,
             international  military  forces,  and   Taliban   to   protect
             civilians from harm caused.   However,  given  the  scale  and
             scope of civilian casualties that has continued at  very  high
             levels for years, it emphasizes that more needs to be done."


         51.  The Appellant's representatives say that  their  client  comes
             from a particularly volatile part of  Afghanistan.   The  EASO
             COI Report Afghanistan Security Situation  (May  2018)  states
             that "the Talban have a 'high' 'active and physical  presence'
             (districts attacked at least twice a week' in Tagab  [AB  page
             213].  In 2017 UNAMA documented 101 civilian victims in Kapisa
             (34 deaths and 67 injured), a 19% decrease compared to 2016.


         52.  The CPIN  Afghanistan:  Security  and  humanitarian  situation
             (April 2018) acknowledges that "Since the promulgation  of  AK
             in May 2012 the overall number of civilian deaths and injuries
             in Afghanistan documented by UNAMA has increased.  The  number
             of civilian casualties in 2016  (11,418  -  3,498  deaths  and
             7,920 injured) has increased by 32% compared to 2011 (7,842) -
             the highest since recording began in 2009; and a  3%  increase
             in total civilian casualties compared to 2015 [�2.3.14].   The
             worst affected areas were the southern and  eastern  provinces
             of  Helmand,  Nangarhar,  Kandaha,  Kunar  and  Ghazni,  which
             experiences  50%  of  all  security  related  incidents.   The
             Taliban increased their  activities  in  northern  and  north-
             eastern Afghanistan and Farah in the west, as well as  putting
             pressure  on  the  Government's  control  of  the   provincial
             capitals of Farah (Farah province), Kunduz (Kunduz  province),
             Lashkar  Gah  (Helmand  province)  and  Tirin   Kot   (Uruzgan
             province)  [�2.3.15].   Reflecting  the   worsening   security
             situation, the first  six  months  of  2017  saw  the  highest
             numbers of civilian casualties recorded in Kabul province  due
             to suicide and complex attacks in Kabul city.  However, nearly
             60% of civilian casualties in Kabul  city  were  caused  by  a
             single suicide attack in May 2017,  and  the  number  of  high
             profile attacks in  the  city  in  2016  decreased  from  2015
             [�2.3.16].   the  proportion   of   civilian   casualties   in
             Afghanistan remains low with around 0.03%  of  the  population
             injured or killed each year (taking  the  2016  UNAMA  numbers
             against a population estimate  of  around  30  million).   The
             proportion of civilian casualties recorded in  Kabul  city  in
             the first six months of 2017 equates to 0.02%  of  the  city's
             population [�2.3.17]."

24.  In the light of the objective evidence, the judge accepted  that  there
    has been a deterioration in the overall  country  conditions,  but  the
    materials submitted were not such as to show that  AK  Afghanistan  has
    been fundamentally overtaken.  The judge said it was held  in  AK  that
    those returning to Afghanistan would  only  be  at  risk  in  terms  of
    Article 15(c) if their circumstances revealed an  enhanced  risk.   The
    judge  considered  Ms  O'Reilly's  contention  that  her   client   was
    vulnerable for the reasons set out at paragraph 53.  She also contended
    that  the  appellant  does  not  have  a  family  support  network   in
    Afghanistan and will be exposed to the kind of risks  detailed  in  the
    country guidance case of AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012]
    UKUT 00016.

25.   The  judge  considered  the  appellant's   family   circumstances   at
    paragraphs 54 to 60.  She held that the appellant has  failed  to  tell
    the truth about his family circumstances.  She saw no reason to believe
    that his parents  and  siblings  are  not  still  living  in  Sherkheil
    village, nor that a family member (either his father or his uncle  RGS)
    cannot travel to Kabul to meet him and accompany him to  his  own  home
    area.

26.  The judge did not accept that the appellant has ongoing  mental  health
    issues  as  contended  by  his  representatives.   She   reached   this
    conclusion following consideration of the  medical  evidence  that  was
    before her.

27.  The judge concluded that the  appellant  is  of  an  age  and  physical
    maturity  which  militates  against  him  being  vulnerable  to  sexual
    exploitation.  She held that it has not been  shown  that  he  has  any
    mental impairment that would take him out of the general guidance given
    in AK Afghanistan.  He will have the support of his family in Sherkheil
    village.  She considered that he can return to his province of  origin,
    where he will have a social network to help him adapt to life  back  in
    Afghanistan.  In her judgment the appellant is not entitled to a  grant
    of humanitarian protection under the Qualification Directive.

28.  The judge considered the appellant's Article 8 claim and found that  it
    has not been shown that the consequences of removal for the appellant's
    help would be of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation of
    Article 8.  In her judgment there was nothing to justify a  finding  of
    compelling circumstances not recognised under the Rules.  She dismissed
    the appellant's appeal under Article 8.  Again these findings have  not
    been challenged and shall stand.

29.  Permission was granted by FtTJ Robertson to the appellant to  challenge
    the judge's  decision  on  the  first  ground  that  the  judge  placed
    inappropriate weight on the brief answers the appellant provided in his
    screening interview when assessing his credibility.  It was  argued  in
    the grounds that a screening interview  is  not  used  to  explore  the
    substance of the claim, as submitted in the evidence of the SSHD in the
    case of AN & FA (Children) R, (On the Application of)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA 1636.

30.  FtTJ Robertson said that there was less arguable merit in ground  2  in
    the absence of establishing that the first ground  has  resulted  in  a
    finding of a material error of law.  Ground 2  argued  that  the  judge
    failed to make  findings  on  post-hearing  submissions  regarding  the
    recent grant of permission to appeal the CG case, AS (Safety of  Kabul)
    by the Court of Appeal in part because of  the  crucial  factual  error
    regarding the level of violence in Kabul.

31.  Mr Bandegani  majored  on  the  second  ground  and  gave  very  little
    attention to the first ground.  In relation to the first ground he said
    the judge should not have taken into account the appellant's answers in
    the screening interview.  This error by the judge  materially  affected
    her global findings.

32.  On the first ground of appeal, I accept Mr Avery's submission that  the
    judge made the right assessment.  The judge found  that  the  appellant
    had lied.  She did not accept anything the appellant said.  I find that
    the judge placed appropriate weight on the screening interview for  the
    reasons given by her.  The judge's credibility findings are set out  at
    paragraphs 32 to 41.  At paragraph 32 that  the  judge  considered  the
    appellant's screening interview which was conducted at the time when he
    was 17 years old.  I find that the judge was right to place  weight  on
    the fact that only the appellant possessed the  information  about  his
    father and since it was the basis for his claim to asylum, the omission
    fundamentally affected his  credibility.   The  judge  further  devoted
    paragraphs 33 to 40 to what she considered to be serious  discrepancies
    in the appellant's witness statement and his substantive interview.   I
    find that these findings were properly made  and  sound.   I  found  no
    error of law in the judge's credibility findings.

33.  I now turn to the  issue  of  Article  15(c)  which  formed  the  major
    argument by Mr Bandegani.  I have already  cited  paragraph  6  of  the
    judge's decision where she was asked to consider in  a  letter  by  the
    appellant's representatives dated 21 March  2019  developments  in  the
    appeal of AS.   I have seen a copy of the letter from  the  appellant's
    solicitors.  The letter did not identify the reasons why the  Court  of
    Appeal set AS aside.  Mr Bandegani said he was in the court room on  12
    March 2019 at the time when the Court of Appeal announced in open court
    that the Upper Tribunal had erred in their decision in AS by  assessing
    the violence in Kabul as being 1 in 10,000 instead of 1 in  1,000.   He
    said AS was now back with the Upper Tribunal for the Upper Tribunal  to
    decide the scope of the hearing taking into account what the  Court  of
    Appeal said in it.  Mr Bandegani did not have a copy of  the  Court  of
    Appeal's judgment.

34.  Mr. Bandegani said that in AS the Tribunal was dealing with whether  it
    was reasonable or safe to relocate to Kabul  by  reference  to  Article
    15(c).  He said by reference to AK  the  judge  did  not  provide  good
    reasons for disposing of the case in the way that she did.   By  giving
    consideration to AK, the judge was looking at the  evidence  which  the
    Upper Tribunal looked at in 2012.  The judge was only  looking  to  see
    whether AK remained good law.  He said the judge did not apply the most
    up-to-date country guidance and did not  assess  whether  there  was  a
    degree of violence in his home area.  He said AK only  looks  at  Kabul
    and not the Parwan Province where the appellant comes from.  He said in
    the appellant's bundle there was evidence that spoke to  the  issue  of
    indiscriminate violence in the Parwan Province.  In any event the judge
    was put on notice that safety in Kabul was not available.  He submitted
    that there was no specific finding by  the  judge  that  the  appellant
    would be returned to Kabul.

35.  Mr Avery submitted that Mr Bandegani did not have a copy of  the  Court
    of Appeal's judgment setting AS aside.  In their letter to  the  judge,
    the Court of Appeal had not promulgated its decision in AS.  The  judge
    did not have a reason as to why AS was being set aside and sent back to
    the Tribunal.  Consequently  the  judge  was  entitled  to  proceed  by
    applying AK which was a relevant country guidance case,  that  was  the
    position before AS.  Mr Avery submitted that just because AS  has  been
    overturned by the Court of Appeal does not mean that the appellant will
    suffer an Article 15(c) risk in Kabul especially when  he  will  be  in
    Kabul for a very brief period as his family can pick him up from  there
    and take him back to his home province.  He submitted that AK was valid
    at the time and the judge made the right assessment.

36.  Mr Bandegani in reply referred me to the UNHCR  eligibility  guidelines
    for assessing the international protection needs of asylum seekers from
    Afghanistan dated 30 August 2018, which he said was before  the  judge.
    In its report the UNHCR considered that  given  the  current  security,
    human rights and humanitarian situation in Kabul,  an  internal  flight
    alternative is generally not  available  in  the  city.   Mr  Bandegani
    submitted that the old  UNHCR  eligibility  document  did  not  caution
    return to Kabul.  However in the light of AS where the Court of  Appeal
    has set aside the CG  case  because  of  the  statistical  evidence  of
    violence in Kabul, return to  Kabul  is  not  a  safe  option  for  the
    appellant.

37.  I accept the submissions made by Mr. Avery and find that the judge  did
    not err in law in proceeding with determining the appellant's appeal by
    relying on the CG case of AK for the reasons given by her.  The judge's
    reasons for relying on AK are set out at paragraph 48. The judge relied
    on the relevant Practice Direction  which  states  that  determinations
    bearing the letters CG shall be treated as an authoritative finding  on
    the issue identified in the determination.  As AS has been set aside by
    the Court of Appeal, I find that the  judge  did  not  err  in  law  in
    following AK unless, as she said, there was later  background  material
    which undermined it.  The judge proceeded to  consider  the  background
    material that was drawn to her attention by the appellant's counsel.  I
    find that what Mr Bandegani heard in court which was not transmitted to
    the judge was not sufficient to undermine the judge's reliance  on  AK.



38.  Mr. Bandegani sought to argue that the judge  did  not  assess  whether
    there was a degree of violence in the appellant's home area.    I  find
    that in the light of the objective evidence, the  judge  accepted  that
    there has been a deterioration in the overall  country  conditions  but
    found that the material submitted was not such as to show that  AK  has
    been fundamentally overtaken.

39.  The case of AS was about the safety or reasonableness of relocation  to
    Kabul.  The judge held that there was no  need  for  the  appellant  to
    relocate to Kabul; that he would be safe in his home area.   Therefore,
    I accept Mr Avery's submission that the appellant would be in Kabul for
    only a temporary period prior to his family picking him up  from  Kabul
    and returning home with him to Parwan Province.

40.  I find that the judge's decision was exemplary in  all  respects.   The
    judge's decision discloses no error of law.

41.  The judge's decision dismissing the appellant's appeal shall stand.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
