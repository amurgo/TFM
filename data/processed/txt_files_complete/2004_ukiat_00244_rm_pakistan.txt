Representatives: Mr J. Wyatt, Presenting Officer, for the appellant;  Mr  M.
Janjua, legal representative, Janjua & Associates, for the respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant, Entry Clearance Officer, Karachi, has appealed  against
      the determination of an Adjudicator  Mr  D.G.  Shimmin,  allowing  the
      appeal  of  the respondent (hereafter  the  claimant),  a  citizen  of
      Pakistan, against the decision  refusing  him  entry  clearance  as  a
      spouse.

2.    On 23 October 2002 the Entry Clearance Officer refused the  claimant's
      application  because he was not satisfied he and his spouse  would  be
      able to maintain themselves  adequately  without  recourse  to  public
      funds.  Given that the sponsor  had  been  residing  in  Pakistan  for
      eleven months and expecting a child in five  months' time, the ECO did
      not consider it reasonably likely she would gain employment.  Further,
      he did not consider she had any significant savings and  thought  that
      her account had been inflated  to  facilitate  this  application.   He
      noted that the claimant had no job available to him in the UK.

3.    The claimant appealed against the Entry Clearance  Officer's  refusal.
      In reviewing his decision on 3 May 2003 the ECO  decided  to  maintain
      his decision. He wrote:-

             "The sponsor has submitted  evidence  of  employment  but  the
             letter from the employer casts doubt on  its  security  (sic).
             There  is   no  evidence  that  the  letter  of  an  offer  of
             employment for the appellant in any way matches his skills  or
             any previous experience."

4.    The Adjudicator heard evidence from  the  sponsor  and  also  admitted
      into evidence further documents relating to the  sponsor's  employment
      history, savings and a job offer made to the claimant.

5.    The Adjudicator found the sponsor's evidence wholly credible.  He  was
      satisfied that at the  date of decision she had �2000 in  savings  and
      that, very shortly after the date of decision, she had had  employment
      from  which   she  received  enough  income  to  maintain  the  couple
      adequately.  He was also satisfied that the  claimant   had  had  (and
      still had) a viable job offer in the UK.

6.    The grounds of  appeal  to  the  Tribunal  were  essentially  twofold.
      Firstly, in respect of the sponsor, it was contended that at the  date
      of decision she did not  have  employment  and  that,  being   heavily
      pregnant at the time, it was not reasonably foreseeable she  would  be
      able to obtain employment "so soon after the  decision"  -  this  last
      phrase we take to be a reference to the  post-decision  evidence  that
      the sponsor commenced employment within weeks of the date of decision.
       Secondly, in respect of the claimant it was  submitted  that  at  the
      date of decision there was no evidence he had been offered employment,
      nor did the offer of employment made post-decision match  "any  skills
      or previous experience of the appellant."

7.    Before proceeding to evaluate this case it  is  worthwhile  rehearsing
      two points.  There was no dispute in this case that the  claimant  met
      all the other requirements of paragraph 281 of HC 395.  The only basis
      for refusal was that the claimant had not  shown that both parties and
      any dependants could be  adequately  maintained  without  recourse  to
      public funds.  As regards post-decision evidence, it  is  settled  law
      that it is only of relevance if it casts light on what was  reasonably
      foreseeable at the date of decision: see e.g. ex parte Kotecha  [1982]
      ImmAR 88;  ex parte El Hassanin [1986] ImmAR 502.

8.    The grounds of appeal  do  not  challenge  either   the  Adjudicator's
      finding  that the sponsor did obtain genuine  employment  in  December
      2002 or his finding that the sponsor's savings were  genuinely  around
      �2000  (as  opposed  to  being  inflated  for  the  purposes  of   the
      application). Nor  for  that  matter  do  the  grounds  challenge  the
      Adjudicator's finding that the job offer to the claimant was a genuine
      one.  Given the further evidence placed before  the  Adjudicator   and
      the evident ability of  the  sponsor  through  her  oral  evidence  to
      resolve the doubts raised by the ECO, it is not surprising that  those
      findings are no longer challenged.   For  our  part  we  are  entirely
      satisfied that on the further evidence before the Adjudicator  he  was
      quite  entitled  to  conclude  that  the   sponsor  had   given   true
      particulars of her employment history and that the job  offer  to  the
      claimant was a viable one.

9.     It  remains,  however,  to  consider  whether   it   was   reasonably
      foreseeable at the date of decision that the sponsor and the  claimant
      would become economically active. At this point we  would  accept  the
      general point implicit in the grounds of appeal that just because  (as
      things turned out in this case) a sponsor becomes employed soon  after
      the date of decision does not necessarily mean this sequence of events
      was reasonably foreseeable.

10.   However, on the evidence  before  the  Adjudicator  in  this  case  we
      consider it  was  properly  open  to  him  to  conclude  that  it  was
      reasonable foreseeable the sponsor would  become  economically  active
      within six months.  For one thing she  had  worked  as  a  packer  and
      gained a diploma in child care and  had  done  occasional  work  as  a
      babysitter. For another, in the  application  form  in  reply  to  the
      questions about the sponsor's employment, the answer  given  was  that
      she had no job  "at  present":   she  did  not  say  that  she  was  a
      housewife; and there was nothing to indicate she  did  not  intend  to
      work upon return to the UK. It is true that she described  herself  as
      pregnant and expecting a baby in several months. This prompted the ECO
      to assess that employment was not reasonably foreseeable at  the  date
      of  decision.  That  assessment  in  our  view  was  quite  misplaced,
      certainly in the generalised form  in  which  it  was  stated  in  the
      refusal decision ("cannot reasonably [be] expected to start employment
      until at least four months after the birth").  UK  employment law  and
      practice fully recognises that maternity and economic activity are not
      mutually exclusive. It is not wholly uncommon for women to  return  to
      work within a matter of weeks  of  giving  birth.  We  simply  do  not
      understand where the ECO plucked the four  months  figures  from;   it
      certainly has no rational basis as a criterion of what  is  reasonably
      foreseeable in the case of a sponsor with  awareness  of  the  ongoing
      need for her and her spouse to comply with immigration rules.

11.   In this connection the sponsor's post-decision  activity  is  of  some
      significance. The Adjudicator found the sponsor a straightforward  and
      truthful witness and there is no suggestion  in  this  case  that  her
      initiative in finding work within six weeks of the  date  of  decision
      was self-serving or simply a tactical reaction to the refusal.    Thus
      it  was  post-decision  activity   which  was  rightly  seen  by   the
      Adjudicator as shedding light on the couple's  intentions  as  at  the
      date  of  decision.   We  should  mention  at  this  point  that   the
      Adjudicator was quite correct, in the light of the further documentary
      evidence, to wholly disregard the ECO's  suspicions (as  expressed  by
      the ECO in his review decision) about the   "security"  (sic)  of  the
      sponsor's   claimed employment.  Furthermore,  the  Adjudicator,  with
      reference to leading  cases,  that  of  Mohd  Shabir  (01/TH/2897)  in
      particular, was quite entitled to conclude that the  level  of  income
      earned by the sponsor in her post-decision employment was  comfortably
      in excess of a minimum adequate maintenance figure. Given our  earlier
      observations on reasonable  foreseeability,  we  consider  that  these
      figures cast light on the income it was reasonably foreseeable at  the
      date of decision to expect  the  sponsor  to  earn,  once  she  became
      economically active (again).

12.   Given the Adjudicator's principal findings, we also see no  reason  to
      doubt that the savings she  had  available  to  her  at  the  date  of
      decision (some �2,000) were genuinely hers.

13.   Having concluded that the Adjudicator did not err in  concluding  that
      the sponsor's reasonably foreseeable income was adequate  to  maintain
      the couple, it is not necessary for us to address the objection raised
      in the grounds to the Adjudicator's  finding that the claimant  had  a
      viable job offer.  However, we would record that  even though  no  job
      offer was mentioned by the  claimant  in  his  application  form,  the
      Adjudicator was satisfied, having  heard  from  the  sponsor,  that  a
      family friend had made known  his  readiness  prior  to  the  date  of
      decision to make a job  available  to  the  claimant  at  his  garage.
      Furthermore, the Adjudicator also accepted that the claimant  had  had
      experience selling cars in Pakistan. Accordingly, we  see  no  factual
      basis for the  assertion raised in the  grounds  of  appeal  that  his
      skills  or  previous  experience  did  not  "match"  the  job   offer.
      Certainly it was open to the Adjudicator to find that  as  the  garage
      was situated in an area  with  a  significant  Asian  population,  the
      claimant had the ability to do the job offered.

14.   For the above reasons the appeal of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  is
      dismissed.
