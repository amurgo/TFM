Hartigan
For the Respondent:    Ms E Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judges  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Scott-Baker and Petherbridge (the panel)  who,  in  a  joint
       decision promulgated on  17  June  2015,  dismissed  the  Appellant's
       appeal against the Respondent's decision of 02 October 2013 to make a
       deportation order against him by virtue of section 32(5)  of  the  UK
       Borders Act 2007.

Background

    2. The Appellant is a national of Jamaica, date  of  birth  21  November
       1975. He entered the United Kingdom in February 2002 as a visitor but
       subsequently overstayed. During this time he met PB and they  married
       on 14 February 2003. The Appellant returned to  Jamaica  and  applied
       for entry clearance on the basis of his spousal  relationship.  Entry
       clearance was eventually granted following an appeal.  The  Appellant
       re-entered the United Kingdom in February 2004.

    3. The Appellant has two children with his wife, born in September  2007
       and November 2010. The Appellant also has two children with LH,  born
       in May 2006 and July 2010. He has two other children, one British and
       one  Jamaican,  but  he  does  not  have  any   subsisting   parental
       relationship with either of these two children. The Appellant's  wife
       and LH remained close friends and the Appellant provided  child  care
       for both his wife and LH.

    4. In October 2005 the Appellant was convicted of possession of a  class
       A drug with intent to supply  and  received  an  18  month  custodial
       sentence. In May 2008, following a guilty  plea,  the  Appellant  was
       again convicted of the same offence and received a three and  a  half
       year custodial sentence. He was served with a  deportation  order  in
       March 2009 and refused Indefinite Leave to Remain as a result of  his
       convictions. An appeal against this decision  was  dismissed  by  the
       First-tier Tribunal but, on appeal to the Upper Tribunal, his  appeal
       was allowed by Lord Justice Sedley and Upper Tribunal Judges Lane and
       Perkins in a decision promulgated on 22 July 2010. In reaching  their
       decision the Upper Tribunal placed significant reliance on  a  report
       by an independent social worker in  respect  of  the  impact  of  the
       decision on the Appellant's relationship with his children.

    5. On 16 August 2013 the Appellant was convicted of inflicting  Grievous
       Bodily Harm (GBH) on a partner and received a  three  year  custodial
       sentence. The Appellant submitted an application for a further  grant
       of Discretionary Leave to Remain on 12 September 2013 but,  following
       his GBH conviction, the Respondent issued a Notice  of  Liability  to
       Automatic Deportation against the Appellant on 02 October  2013.  The
       Appellant instructed MK Suri & Co to represent him and  a  Notice  of
       Appeal was lodged with the First-tier Tribunal.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal panel

    6. Prior to the appeal hearing before the First-tier Tribunal there  had
       been two case  management  hearings  on  25  September  2014  and  27
       November 2014. On both occasions the Appellant was represented by  MK
       Suri & Co. The First-tier Tribunal were advised that  an  independent
       social worker's report was to be commissioned, as  was  a  psychology
       report, and that he was proposing  to  call  four  witnesses.  On  10
       December 2014 the Appellant and his representatives were served  with
       notice of the hearing which was to extend for 3 days from 20 to 22 of
       May 2015. The appeal was identified as a Nexus appeal, one  in  which
       there  would  be  evidence  from  police  officers  relating  to  the
       Appellant's character and conduct.

    7. On  11th  and  13th  May  2015  MK  Suri  &  Co  made  two  identical
       applications to adjourn  the  hearing  to  enable  the  Appellant  to
       instruct  legal  aid  solicitors.  The  Appellant's  wife,  who   was
       privately funding the appeal, did not have sufficient  funds  to  pay
       for  his  legal  representation.  Sutovic  &  Hartigan,  the  current
       representatives, agreed to the Appellant's instruction provided  they
       had sufficient opportunity to make an assessment for exceptional case
       funding from the Legal Aid Agency and they had sufficient opportunity
       to  prepare  the  case.  Sutovic  &  Hartigan  anticipated  that  the
       application for exceptional case funding would take 4 to 6 weeks  but
       that they could only apply once they had the file and they  estimated
       a total delay of 6 to 8 weeks.

    8. The applications were refused on 14th and 15th May 2015 on the  basis
       that the funding issue should have been considered earlier, that,  as
       the Appellant was detained, it was in his interests for the appeal to
       be heard as soon as possible, and that the obtaining of legal aid was
       wholly speculative and the appeal could proceed  with  the  Appellant
       unrepresented. On 15th May 2015 MK Suri & Co indicated the  Appellant
       had an outstanding bill of �10,000 together with Counsel's  fees  and
       they requested that they be struck off the record. On 18th  May  2015
       Sutovic & Hartigan renewed their application for an adjournment. They
       maintained they had now been formally instructed  by  the  Appellant,
       that the case was extremely complex, and that it  affected  not  just
       his rights but those of his wife and children. They  maintained  that
       the application for exceptional funding was not speculative and  that
       the Appellant's inability to obtain legal representation, in light of
       the complexities of the case, would constitute a breach of Article 8,
       in light of Gudanaviciene [2014] EWHC 1840.

    9. There was no appearance by any legal representative on 20  May  2015.
       There was no independent social worker's report before the First-tier
       Tribunal. The panel considered  the  adjournment  application  having
       heard from the Appellant. In refusing the application the panel noted
       that the Appellant had experience of the appeal procedure in light of
       his 2010 appeal, and that he hoped to be at home when the independent
       social workers report was commissioned. Given  that  he  remained  in
       detention and had been separated from his family for two  years,  the
       panel were of the view that any social  worker's  report  would  have
       been afforded little  weight  as  it  could  not  have  recorded  the
       familial relationship and the interaction due to the separation.  The
       panel noted it had on file an OAsys report dated  November  2014  and
       that a psychological report would be provided. The panel believed  it
       had all the documentation before it that it needed to  enable  it  to
       make its decision. The panel noted that,  despite  being  on  record,
       Sutovic & Hartigan had not attended the hearing. The panel stated  it
       had no indication as to the chance of success in obtaining legal aid,
       that the chances of obtaining exceptional  funding  was  speculative,
       and there was no good explanation as to why an application for  legal
       aid had not been made at an earlier opportunity. The panel  indicated
       it was mindful that the Appellant remained in detention and noted the
       significant delays in the listing of deportation appeals.

   10. The panel proceeded to hear the  appeal.  It  is  apparent  from  the
       determination that the Respondent  produced  a  bundle  of  documents
       including CRIS entries late in the day (see  paragraphs  18,  22  and
       26). The panel heard from two  police  officers  and  then  from  the
       Appellant, his wife and LH. The Home Office Presenting  Officer  made
       submissions and the panel heard submissions from the Appellant's wife
       on his behalf.

   11. The panel's determination ran to 38 pages, and there was  an  addenda
       decision in respect of the refusal to grant an adjournment.  Although
       accurately setting out the relevant legal framework by  reference  to
       paragraph A362 of the immigration rules the panel  applied  paragraph
       399 as it was prior to  28  July  2014.  The  panel  found  that  the
       Appellant had a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his
       wife's two children, and that his relationship with his wife was also
       genuine and subsisting. The panel found it would not be reasonable to
       expect his wife's two children  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom,  but
       found, applying paragraph 399(a)(ii)(b), that their mother  was  able
       to care for  them  in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  panel  found  the
       Appellant also had a genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship
       with his two children with LH, but, for the same reasons, there would
       be no breach of 399(a)(ii)(b) as LH would be able to care  for  them.
       The panel found it in the best interests of the  children  to  remain
       with their respective mothers. The panel were not satisfied it  would
       be unduly harsh for his wife to remain in the United Kingdom  without
       the Appellant, or that he met the requirements  of  399A.  The  panel
       went  on  to   consider   whether   there   were   'very   compelling
       circumstances' over and above those described in paragraphs  399  and
       399A, applying Chege (section 117D - Article  8  -  approach)  [2015]
       UKUT 00165 (IAC) and taking into account the  factors  identified  in
       sections 117A to D of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002. Having concluded there were  no  compelling  circumstances  the
       panel dismissed the appeal.

The Grounds of Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

   12. The Grounds contend that the panel materially erred  in  refusing  to
       grant the adjournment request,  and  in  its  assessment  both  under
       paragraph 399 of the immigration rules and in respect of Article 8.

The error of law hearing

   13. On behalf of the Appellant Mr Jones accepted that the  Appellant  had
       been convicted of a serious offence. He referred us to the  basis  of
       the adjournment request in the written applications of 13th and  18th
       May 2015 and submitted that  a  report  from  an  independent  social
       worker had tipped  the  balance  in  the  previous  2010  appeal.  He
       submitted that such a  report  would  have  provided  the  First-tier
       Tribunal with assistance as to the best interests  of  the  children.
       Although the Appellant was in detention there had been a long  period
       since his previous release when he co-habited with his wife and their
       children. He submitted that the absence of any  legal  representative
       resulted in perceived  unfairness  and  drew  our  attention  to  the
       relative brevity of the evidence as recorded by the  panel.  Although
       the Home Office Presenting Officer indicated that  the  Nexus  bundle
       had been served on the previous representative on 27 October 2014  it
       was apparent that the Appellant did  not  have  that  bundle  at  the
       commencement of the hearing. According to the determination documents
       GG1 to SS34 had not been included  in  the  Respondent's  bundle.  Mr
       Jones noted that the  panel  only  accorded  minimal  weight  to  the
       psychological report as the report did  not  take  into  account  the
       Nexus documents. Had an adjournment  been  granted  the  psychologist
       would, in his submission, have been asked to comment on  the  further
       Nexus documentation. The only evidence relating to the impact on  the
       children had been given by the  mothers,  but  they  had  emotionally
       invested in the appeal and the First-tier Tribunal  would  have  been
       greatly assisted by a report from an independent social worker  which
       would have more effectively given a voice to the children.  Mr  Jones
       submitted it was not speculative that exceptional  finding  would  be
       provided, as evidenced by the fact that the Legal Aid Agency  had  in
       fact issued such funding after the decision. As a minimum  the  panel
       should have adjourned to consider  whether  legal  aid  would  become
       available rather than proceed on its own view of  the  likelihood  of
       such finding becoming available. The panel  should  have  given  more
       weight to the letters from Sutovic & Hartigan, a reputable  firm,  in
       terms of their assessment of the likelihood  of  legal  aid  becoming
       available. Had the Appellant been legally represented  he  would  not
       have given his own judgement as to  the  circumstances  in  which  an
       independent social workers report would be obtained because one would
       have  been  commissioned  regardless  of  his  judgement.  Given  the
       complexity of the law in this area elements  that  should  have  been
       drawn out in the hearing had not been.

   14. Ms Savage submitted that any error in respect of the  application  of
       the wrong immigration rules was  immaterial  because  the  panel  had
       taken into account all relevant factors. On the basis of the evidence
       before the panel  it  was  difficult  to  see  how  they  could  have
       concluded that the impact on the children could be unduly  harsh.  Ms
       Savage pointed out that there had been two case  management  hearings
       at  which  the  Appellant  had  been  represented  by  his   previous
       solicitors. The adjournment application was only made  a  short  time
       before the appeal hearing and the panel  were  entitled  to  find  it
       speculative that exceptional  case  funding  would  be  obtained.  Ms
       Savage  pointed  to  various  parts  of  the  determination  such  as
       paragraph's 26, 33 and 69 where the panel had taken steps  to  ensure
       the hearing was fair and that the Appellant  could  properly  present
       his case. In response Mr Jones made us aware that the  Appellant  did
       not have the Respondent's bundle throughout the hearing and  that  he
       had only been served with the Nexus bundle on the 2nd day.

Discussion

   15. The first ground of appeal relates to the lawfulness of the  decision
       to refuse to grant an adjournment. In an  addenda  report  the  panel
       gave their reasons for rejecting the adjournment request.  The  panel
       accurately referred to  the  overriding  objective  of  the  Tribunal
       Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)
       Rules 2014, which is to enable the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly
       and  justly.  The  panel  referred  to  the  authority   of   Nwaigwe
       (adjournment; fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC). This indicates  that
       the test to be applied when considering  an  adjournment  request  is
       essentially one of fairness, as opposed to a consideration of whether
       the Tribunal acted reasonably. The question is whether the refusal to
       grant the adjournment resulted in any deprivation of the  Appellant's
       right to a fair hearing.  Having asked ourselves this  question,  and
       for the following reasons, we are satisfied that  the  Appellant  was
       deprived of a fair hearing.

   16. The Appellant,  or  rather  his  wife,  could  no  longer  afford  to
       privately fund his appeal. They  owed  their  previous  solicitors  a
       large amount of money. Very late in  the  day  it  appears  that  the
       Appellant was informed of the possibility of  instructing  legal  aid
       solicitors,  who  could  apply  for  exceptional  case  funding.  The
       Appellant's current solicitors were  approached  and  indicated  they
       would be able to represent the  Appellant.  They  needed  however  to
       obtain the papers from the  previous  solicitors  and  to  take  full
       instructions  from  the  Appellant,  who   was   detained.   It   was
       anticipated, relying on detailed grounds in the  adjournment  letters
       and in light of the authority of Gudanaviciene [2014] EWCA Civ  1622,
       that funding to enable legal representation would  be  obtained,  but
       that there would be a delay of about 6 to 8 weeks.

   17. The  panel  were  however  of  the  view  that  any  application  for
       exceptional case funding was speculative.  There  was  of  course  no
       guarantee that the Legal Aid Agency would have granted legal aid.  We
       have carefully considered the letter from Sutovic &  Hartigan,  dated
       18 May 2015, setting out why the firm believed that funding would  be
       granted. It would have been clear to the Legal Aid Agency  that  this
       was a relatively complex appeal  directly  impacting  on  four  young
       children and which involved, over a three day hearing, the giving  of
       evidence by two police officers and the need to assess a  significant
       volume of evidence, including  technical  CRIS  reports  relating  to
       matters in respect of which  no  charges  were  brought  against  the
       Appellant, and expert evidence. The likelihood of obtaining legal aid
       should also have  been  considered  in  light  of  the  authority  of
       Gudanaviciene [2014] EWCA Civ 1622, which indicated that equality  of
       arms had to be guaranteed to the extent that each side was afforded a
       reasonable opportunity to present their case  under  conditions  that
       did not place them at a substantial disadvantage vis-�-vis the  other
       side. Having holistic regard to these factors we  are  satisfied  the
       panel were not reasonably entitled to conclude that the likelihood of
       obtaining legal aid was purely speculative.

   18. The panel did not believe there  was  any  utility  in  obtaining  an
       independent social worker's report given that the Appellant  remained
       in detention. Any such report, in the  panel's  view,  would  attract
       little weight given that the Appellant had been  separated  from  his
       family for 2 years. It is not clear whether the panel were aware that
       an independent social worker would be able to carry out  his  or  her
       assessment even if one parent was detained. It  was  clear  that  the
       Appellant  continued  to  have  direct  contact  with  his   children
       throughout his incarceration (see paragraph 31 of the determination).
       The social worker would have been in a position  to  comment  on  the
       continued direct interaction between the Appellant and his  children.
       Given the primary importance in the appeal of  identifying  the  best
       interests of the children and in assessing the impact on the children
       of the Appellant's deportation, we  respectfully  disagree  with  the
       panel's conclusion concerning the utility of  an  independent  social
       worker's report. We note that the  earlier  Upper  Tribunal  decision
       allowing his previous  appeal  against  a  deportation  order  placed
       significant reliance on such a report. An independent  social  worker
       would have assisted the Tribunal by  way  of  an  independent  expert
       assessment of the impact on the children of permanent separation from
       their  father.  In  circumstances  where  there  was   a   reasonable
       likelihood of obtaining such a report  we  are  satisfied  the  panel
       erred in law in finding that  the  report  would  not  have  been  of
       assistance to them were the adjournment granted.

   19. The First-tier Tribunal took into account the  Appellant's  continued
       detention and noted that an adjournment would result in a much  later
       hearing date as deportation appeals were  being  listed  for  January
       2016. While the First-tier Tribunal were entitled to take account  of
       the likely delay in re-listing the hearing as a  factor  relevant  to
       the overriding objective to deal with the case fairly and justly, the
       Appellant had indicated his willingness to remain in detention for  a
       longer period  to  ensure  that  all  reasonable  opportunities  were
       explored to obtain legal representation.  No account appears to  have
       been taken of this indication. In assessing whether the Appellant was
       deprived of a fair hearing by reason of the  failure  to  adjourn  to
       seek legal aid representation, we additionally take into  account  Mr
       Jones's submission that the Appellant did not  have  a  copy  of  the
       Respondent's main bundle throughout the appeal hearing, and  that  he
       was only served with the Nexus bundle (which  we  understand  is  the
       respondent's   'supplementary   bundle'   as   identified   in    the
       determination) on the 2nd day of the hearing.

   20. We are also satisfied that the panel applied the wrong version of the
       immigration rules in respect of paragraphs 399 and that this amounted
       to a material legal error. Paragraph A362 of the  immigration  rules,
       which the panel referred to at paragraph  65  of  its  determination,
       reads:

         "Where Article 8 is raised in the context of deportation under Part
         13 of these Rules, the claim under  Article  8  will  only  succeed
         where the requirements of these rules as at 28 July 2014  are  met,
         regardless of when  the  notice  of  intention  to  deport  or  the
         deportation order, as appropriate, was served."

   21. Paragraph 39 of YM  (Uganda)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1292 reads:

         "So far as the 2014 Rules are  concerned,  it  is  clear  from  the
         provisions of Rule A362 itself, as  well  as  the  statement  under
         "implementation" in the Statement of Changes and paragraphs 3.4 and
         4.7 of the Explanatory Memorandum, that the 2014 Rules  are  to  be
         applied to all decisions concerning Article 8 claims that are  made
         after 28 July 2014. As Lord Hoffmann said in the  Odelola  case  at
         [7], the Immigration Rules are a statement by the SSHD of  how  she
         will exercise powers of control  over  immigration.  Thus,  in  the
         absence of any statement to the contrary, the most natural  reading
         of the Rules is that they apply to  decisions  taken  by  the  SSHD
         until such time as she promulgates new rules, after which she  will
         decide according to the new rules. The same applies to decisions by
         tribunals and the courts: that is why in MF (Nigeria) v  SSHD  [15]
         (hereafter "MF(Nigeria)"), the Court of Appeal held that  both  the
         UT and it were obliged to apply the 2012 Rules to MF,  despite  the
         fact that the SSHD had taken her original decision  in  2010  under
         the pre-existing rules."

   22. Paragraph 13 of Chege (section 117D - Article 8  -  approach)  [2015]
       UKUT 00165 (IAC) reads:

         "There had been some discussion before the First-tier  Tribunal  as
         to whether the Rules presently in force were the relevant Rules  to
         be considered in determining Mr Chege's appeal or whether the Rules
         in force at the date of the decision were the relevant Rules. In so
         far as his appeal was concerned the parties agreed that the outcome
         would in  any  event  be  the  same  whichever  set  of  Rules  was
         considered. HC 532 provides that "the changes  take  effect  on  28
         July 2014 and apply to all  ECHR  Article  8  claims  from  foreign
         criminals which are decided on or after that date".  Although  this
         appears on its face to mean a decision by  the  SSHD,  because  the
         Tribunal does not take decisions  in  the  context  in  which  that
         expression is here being used, paragraph A362 refers to  the  Rules
         having effect regardless of when the notice  of  intention  or  the
         deportation order ...was served; the explanatory memorandum at  3.4
         and 3.5 talks of harmonisation of the Rules  with  Immigration  Act
         2014 and [38] and [39] of YM (Uganda) [2014]  EWCA  Civ  1292  make
         clear that irrespective of when the deportation order was signed or
         a decision to deport made, if the appeal is determined  after  28th
         July 2014, then the Rules in force on that date  are  the  relevant
         Rules."

   23. The appeal was heard in May 2015. Following the authorities  of  both
       YM (Uganda) and Chege the panel should have applied  the  version  of
       paragraph 399 as it was after 28  July  2014.  It  is  apparent  from
       paragraphs 127, 134 and 138 that the panel applied  the  wrong  legal
       test. The change in the immigration rules was  significant.  The  new
       version of paragraph 399(a) required the panel to consider whether it
       would have been unduly harsh for the Appellant's children to live  in
       Jamaica, and also whether it would be unduly harsh for them to remain
       in the United Kingdom without him. There is no requirement that there
       be another family member who is able to care for  the  children,  the
       basis upon which the  panel  dismissed  the  appeal  under  paragraph
       399(a). Following MAB (para 399;  "unduly  harsh")  USA  [2015]  UKUT
       00435 (IAC) the focus of whether the decision would be  unduly  harsh
       is solely upon an evaluation of the consequences and  impact  on  the
       children. In respect of this particular rule, there is  no  balancing
       exercise against public interest factors (see also Bossade (ss.117A-D
       - interrelationship with Rules) [2015] UKUT 00415 (IAC)).  It  cannot
       therefore be said that the panel's assessment, at paragraph  166,  of
       the unduly harsh consideration contained  in  section  117C,  renders
       immaterial its  assessment  under  the  wrong  version  of  paragraph
       399(a).  This is because, in finding that the impact on the  children
       would not be 'unduly harsh', the panel only gave as their reasons the
       fact that the Appellant had been sentenced to a term of  imprisonment
       for GBH and was subject to a deportation order. Both are  extraneous,
       public  interest  factors.  There  has  therefore  been   no   lawful
       assessment under paragraph 399(a).

   24. Ms Savage sought to convince us that the panel had taken  account  of
       all factors relevant  to  the  children,  including  the  absence  of
       evidence relating to safeguarding concerns and the fact that children
       could maintain contact with their father through  visits  and  remote
       forms of communication. She submitted it was difficult to see how, on
       the evidence before the panel, it could have found the impact on  the
       children to be unduly harsh.

   25. Having failed to address their mind to the correct legal test, we are
       not satisfied that the panel would, as urged by Ms Savage, have  been
       bound to conclude that the impact on the children would not be unduly
       harsh. The  determination  itself  does  not  disclose  any  detailed
       investigation by the panel in respect of the  likely  impact  of  the
       Appellant's deportation on his  children.  At  paragraph  50  of  the
       determination it appears that the Appellant's evidence commenced with
       cross-examination. It is unclear from the face of  the  determination
       whether the Appellant was given any initial  opportunity  to  present
       evidence prior to cross-examination and no questions appear  to  have
       been asked of him in respect of the likely impact of his  deportation
       on his children. The evidence from the Appellant's wife was  recorded
       in three short paragraphs. She was asked (it is unclear by whom) what
       would happen if  the  Appellant  was  deported.  She  said  that  the
       children would not understand why he was not with them and that  they
       continued to ask when he would be back. The evidence from LH purports
       to have  been  recorded  in  four  paragraphs;  however  it  is  only
       paragraph 60 that expressly records her  evidence.  She  claimed  the
       Appellant was a great father, that he saw  her  children  most  days,
       that the children were in good health and that she and  her  children
       visited the Appellant in prison.

   26. We are in no doubt that, had the Appellant been legally  represented,
       the representative would have sought to  extract  significantly  more
       information  concerning  the   children's   circumstances   and   the
       consequences for each of them  of  the  Appellant's  deportation.  We
       accept Mr Jones's submission that the mothers would have  emotionally
       invested in the appeal and that the panel would have been assisted by
       an independent social workers report, which would have been  provided
       a more independent voice to the children in respect  of  their  bonds
       with the Appellant and the impact on them of his  deportation.  Given
       the  central  importance  in  this  appeal  of  the  children's  best
       interests we are satisfied that the deprivation of an opportunity  to
       apply for exceptional funding to obtain  legal  representation  as  a
       result of the adjournment decision constituted a  material  error  of
       law. We consequently find that  the  panel's  failure  to  apply  the
       correct immigration rule renders unsustainable its  assessment  under
       paragraph 399(a).

   27. Mr. Jones informed us that a new independent social  worker's  report
       had already been  prepared,  albeit  in  draft  form,  and  that  the
       psychologist would be approached to enable her to provide an  amended
       or addendum report taking into account the Nexus  documentation  that
       was not previously before her. In light of  this  new  evidence,  and
       given our finding that the panel had not adequately  addressed  their
       minds to the issue of the impact of the deportation on the  children,
       we are satisfied that the most appropriate course of conduct would be
       to remit the appeal back to the First-tier Tribunal for a complete re-
       hearing, before a panel of two judges or a single Judge  and  a  lay-
       member, other than Judges Petherbridge and Scott-Baker.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal made a material error of law.

The appeal is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal pursuant  to  section
12 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act  2007  for  reconsideration,
to be decided afresh.

The appeal will be heard by a panel of either two Judges or a  single  judge
and a lay-member, other than Judges Petherbridge and Scott-Baker.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 13 of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-
tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
