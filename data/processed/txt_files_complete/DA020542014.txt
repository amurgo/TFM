                               KANINI AFRIKANO
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a national of Portugal, was  deported  from  the  United
    Kingdom on or about 3 May  2015.   She  has  provided  no  address  for
    service of notice of a hearing.  This is accordingly  a  suitable  case
    for determination without a hearing.  This decision is to  be  sent  to
    the appellant's last known address in the United  Kingdom  and  to  any
    authority having care of any of her children.


 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the  decision
    to deport her.  Her appeal was dismissed by Judge  David  Clapham  SSC.
    Permission to appeal was granted, on  an  out-of-time  application,  by
    Judge White.  The Secretary of State replied under Rule 24.  There  has
    been no further response from the appellant.

 3. The grounds on which permission to appeal was  granted  were  two-fold.
    The first ground was that Judge Clapham had failed to  appreciate  that
    the appellant was entitled to the heightened protection attributable to
    a person who had been in the United Kingdom for 10 years.  That is  not
    a ground pleaded, and it is, on the facts, not arguable.

 4. The second ground was that it was arguable that the judge was wrong  to
    find that the appellant is a present threat, given  the  evidence  that
    she had committed no further offences and that there was no evidence of
    a note of further offences.

 5. This was a matter of assessment for the judge.  It  is  clear  that  he
    considered the material before him, including that to which the grounds
    refer: see [49] - [52] of his decision in particular.  In  my  judgment
    his assessment discloses no error of law.

 6. The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
