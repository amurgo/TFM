                 secretary of state for the home department
                                                                   Claimants

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms C Soltani, Solicitor, Iris Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Presenting Officer


                    DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Holmes, promulgated on 24 July 2015, dismissing his
    appeal against the decision of the respondent made on 8  December  2014
    to refuse to revoke a deportation order against him.

 2. The appellant's case is that he is at risk  on  return  to  Nigeria  on
    account of his sexuality as a gay or bisexual man. The  respondent  did
    not accept that he is gay  or  bisexual,  and  refused  his  claim  for
    asylum.

 3. It is part of his case that the appellant has had a sexual relationship
    with Mr [A C] who has also sought  asylum  in  the  United  Kingdom  on
    account of his sexuality. His appeal was heard at North Shields  on  15
    January 2015 before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher.  The  appellant
    gave evidence in that appeal (DA/01830/2014), and was not believed; nor
    was Mr [C].

 4. When this appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal,  a  copy  of  the
    decision in Mr [C]'s appeal was provided to the judge and  he  took  it
    into account in reaching his decision - see paragraphs [22 i)], [65]  -
    [75] which, the parties agree, formed a significant part of the reasons
    that the judge in this appeal made  credibility  findings  against  the
    appellant, rejecting also the evidence of Mr [C], although  the  latter
    did not give oral evidence before him.

 5. Since the decision in this case was promulgated, Mr [C]'s appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal has been heard, and in  a  decision  of  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Hanson promulgated on 14 April 2016, Judge Fisher's decision  was
    set aside and the appeal was remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  None
    of the findings of fact were preserved.

 6. When this appeal came before me, both representatives agreed that as  a
    result of  this  development,  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  credibility
    findings were, as  the  grounds  of  appeal  submitted,  undermined  by
    reliance on findings now quashed, and thus involved the  making  of  an
    error of law.   I am satisfied that that  is  so,  and  thus  that  the
    decision must be set aside.



SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law, and I set it aside.

 2. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing  on
    all issues. The hearing must not be before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Holmes or Judge Fisher.
