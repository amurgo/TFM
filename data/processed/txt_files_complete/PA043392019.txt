For the Appellant:     Ms Khan, Counsel instructed by WTB Solicitors LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Somalia.  She  appeals  with  permission
    against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Buckley)  to
    dismiss her protection appeal.

    Background and Matters in Issue

 2. The Appellant claimed asylum on arrival in the United  Kingdom  on  the
    9th October 2018. The basis of her  claim  is  that  she  has  received
    threats from al-Shabaab, who perceive her to be a  'collaborator'  with
    Western interests: the Appellant had at the time  been  working  as  an
    interpreter  for  a  Turkish  hospital  in  Mogadishu.   The  Appellant
    received these threats by telephone and text message in the  summer  of
    2017. She changed her number, but continued to receive them. The caller
    threatened to kill her. The Appellant knew of at least one other  woman
    who was murdered following such threats  and  so  she  took  them  very
    seriously. She moved house and started wearing a full veil in order  to
    disguise herself on her way to and from work, but afraid for  her  life
    she left Somalia in December 2017.  The Appellant  placed  reliance  on
    the decision in MSM  (journalists;  political  opinion;  risk)  Somalia
    [2015] UKUT 413 (IAC).

 3. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral  evidence  from  the  Appellant  and
    having done so it accepted that she was an interpreter working  at  the
    Recip Tayyeb Erdogan Hospital in Mogadishu and that  she  had  received
    threats from al-Shabaab as claimed.  It accepted that she had  in  this
    role received the President's wife when she had  visited  the  hospital
    and that a clip of this meeting was broadcast on state  television.  It
    remains viewable on YouTube today.  It further accepted that there  was
    not in place in Mogadishu effective state protection for  her  and  her
    family and that her rationale for not approaching the  authorities  was
    reasonable.  It accepted that she could not reasonably be  expected  to
    carry on working and  safeguarding  herself  by  wearing  a  full  face
    covering in the street. It went on however to dismiss the  appeal.  The
    Tribunal's central conclusion  was  that  the  Appellant  was  of  'low
    profile' and that as such she was not someone who was reasonably likely
    to  continue  to  attract  the  adverse  attention  of  al-Shabaab.  In
    particular it found that the threats had abated  after  she  had  moved
    house and started covering her face.  In the alternative  the  Tribunal
    found that the Appellant and her husband could move to another part  of
    Somalia where the risk from al-Shabaab would be minimised.

 4. The Appellant now submits that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law  in
    the following material respects:

      i) Perversity. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant had
         in fact been targeted by al-Shabaab because of her work,  but  then
         went on to discount any future risk on the basis that she was  'low
         profile'.  This is logically unsustainable.

     ii) In respect of internal flight the Appellant  points  out  that  the
         Respondent had not raised  this  as  an  alternative  and  that  no
         potential place of internal relocation  had  been  identified.  The
         Appellant is from Mogadishu, and this is where the  threat  to  her
         was made.

    Discussion and Findings

 5. In its decision the First-tier  Tribunal  cites  extensively  from  the
    Respondent's Country Policy and Information  Note  Somalia  (South  and
    Central): Fear of al Shabaab published in July  2017.  In  that  policy
    statement the Secretary of State expresses the view  that  a  "person's
    profile will be important" in assessing any risk from  al-Shabaab.  The
    guidance, in summary, is that al-Shabaab has targeted  individuals  and
    institutions  that  it  perceives   to   represent   or   support   the
    'International  Community'.  Such  individuals  and  institutions   are
    regarded as 'legitimate targets' by al-Shabaab, but the onus is on  the
    individual claimant to establish that he or she is reasonably likely to
    attract the adverse attention of the group.

 6. As  noted  above,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  here  accepted  that  the
    Appellant was of sufficient interest  to  have  attracted  the  adverse
    attention of al-Shabaab. The group threatened on her  on  a  number  of
    occasions, going so far as to secure her new telephone number after she
    had changed it.   Ms Khan submits that having reached that finding,  it
    was irrational for the Tribunal to decide that the Appellant was not of
    sufficiently high a profile to attract the unwanted  attention  of  al-
    Shabaab in the future. Either she attracted their ire  or  she  didn't.
    Mr Tan defended the rationale of the decision on  the  basis  that  the
    Tribunal had distinguished the position  of  the  Appellant  pre-August
    2017 and her position after it. Before then she had been targeted,  but
    after she moved to her cousin's home in another part of Mogadishu,  and
    took measures to disguise herself in the street,  the  threats  abated.
    Mr Tan further pointed to the Tribunal's finding that  the  Appellant's
    family had not received any threats at all.

 7. I am not satisfied that this was a rational conclusion for the Tribunal
    to have reached.    Firstly,  because  the  time  frame  in  which  the
    Appellant was free of threats  was  a  relatively  short  one,  lasting
    between August 2017 when she moved, and December  2017  when  she  left
    Somalia.  There does not appear to be any evidential foundation  for  a
    finding that al-Shabaab had 'lost  interest'  in  her.   She  played  a
    pivotal role at the hospital - as a  Turkish-Somali  translator  it  is
    clear that the Turkish doctors with whom she  worked  would  be  facing
    considerable difficulties in  doing  their  jobs  without  her.   Those
    Turkish  doctors,  and  the  hospital  itself,  represented  the   very
    international community  that  al-Shabaab  have  vowed  to  expel  from
    Somalia.  The Tribunal's finding that the Appellant  was  as  a  result
    threatened by the group is therefore wholly consistent with  the  CPIN.
    The Appellant would be considered by al-Shabaab  to  be  a  'legitimate
    target'.  Second,  the  Tribunal  itself  recognises  that  it  is  not
    'reasonable' to expect the Appellant to avoid  persecution  -  in  this
    case assassination - by moving house and wearing a disguise.  This  was
    the method by which she avoided further problems in the  months  before
    she left Somalia.  Finally because there is, on the application of  the
    country guidance and CPIN, no logical connection between  the  lack  of
    threats made to members of the Appellant's family and any ongoing  risk
    to her person:  there  is  no  evidence  that  al-Shabaab  use  threats
    against family members to try and produce the desired result of  making
    individuals  like  the  Appellant   desist   from   co-operation   with
    international organisations.  All other things being equal,  there  was
    no reason to suppose that al-Shabaab would be any  less  interested  in
    the Appellant today, than at the time that they  were  threatening  her
    life.

 8. The Secretary of State submits that all things are not, however, equal,
    since the threats of  al-Shabaab  have  already  produced  the  desired
    result, ie the Appellant leaving her job. Since she no longer works  at
    the hospital, it is tempting to conclude that the risk to her must have
    entirely abated. Whilst this was not, in fact, the ratio of the  First-
    tier Tribunal decision, it is the Secretary of State's response to  the
    grounds, inasmuch as Mr Tan thereby questions the  materiality  of  any
    errors identified by Ms Khan.

 9. As I note above, before the First-tier Tribunal Ms Khan had  relied  on
    the decision in MSM.  That was a decision concerned with  a  journalist
    facing threats from al-Shabaab, and in respect of whom the Secretary of
    State made exactly the same point as advanced before me by Mr  Tan:  if
    he wished to avoid harm he could do so by giving up his job. The  Upper
    Tribunal situated its analysis in the rights-based  analysis  discussed
    in HJ (Iran) and HT (Cameroon)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2010] UKSC 31.  MSM faced persecution for  reasons  of  his
    imputed political belief  -  al-Shabaab  threatened  him  because  they
    perceived him to be engaged in activity  contrary  to  their  aims  and
    values.  Should MSM be required to give  up  that  job,  upon  pain  of
    death, because al-Shabaab didn't like it? The Tribunal noted that  this
    was not a novel issue [at its ï¿½42]:

         "The main issue in this appeal has arisen  in  cases  beyond  these
         shores.  In Szatv v Minister for Immigration and Citizenship [2007]
         233 CLR 18, the Appellant qualified as a civil engineer. Some years
         later, he began working as a journalist in a particular  region  of
         Ukraine, where he suffered harassment and physical maltreatment  on
         account of his political views.  He fled  to  Australia,  where  he
         sought asylum.  The Refugee Review Tribunal rejected his  claim  on
         the ground that he could return to  a  different  part  of  Ukraine
         where he would not be known and  could  work  in  the  construction
         industry there.  His appeal was  allowed  on  the  basis  that  the
         fallacy in the Tribunal's reasoning was  that  in  order  to  avoid
         persecution the Appellant would have to forfeit the very  right  to
         express his political opinions without fear  of  persecution  which
         the Convention is designed  to  protect.   The  same  approach  was
         applied by the High Court in Appellant  S395/2002  v  Minister  for
         Immigration (216) CLR  473,  at  489  especially.   Notably,  these
         decisions were cited with approval  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  HJ
         (Iran).

10. The central conclusion of the Tribunal in MSM is thus expressed in  the
    headnote:

         "The Appellant is not to be denied refugee  status  on  the  ground
         that it would be open to him to seek to engage in employment  other
         than in the media sector."

11. In the  instant  case  the  Appellant  was  not  a  journalist  but  an
    interpreter. Mr Tan submitted that this being  a  distinct  species  of
    employment  the  ratio  of  MSM  was  not  directly  transferable.  The
    difficulty with that submission is that it overlooks the  causal  nexus
    of the feared harm. Al-Shabaab  want  to  kill  Somalis  who  help  the
    international community because of their - imputed - political opinion.
    To deny such an individual protection on the grounds  that  they  could
    meet the terms of the persecutor would surely be contrary to  the  aims
    of the Refugee Convention.  I am accordingly satisfied that  the  error
    in approach by the First-tier Tribunal is material.

12. I might add that the evidence on why the Appellant is no longer working
    at the hospital is unequivocal:  the reason that she left her  job  and
    fled the country was that she was frightened for her life. The  threats
    were received against the backdrop of the fact  that  she  knew  of  at
    least one other Somali woman who had been murdered for working  at  the
    hospital.  As Ms Khan points out, employment opportunities for Turkish-
    Somali interpreters are not thick on the ground. There  were  not  many
    options open to the Appellant, who had gone to the trouble of  learning
    Turkish precisely in order to obtain employment such as she had.

13. Accordingly, applying the ratio of MSM I find that the Appellant has  a
    well-founded fear of  persecution  in  Mogadishu  for  reasons  of  her
    imputed political opinion.

14. The second ground concerns the Tribunal's reasoning on internal flight.
    This consists of the following sentence at the end of paragraph 48:

         "I find that internal relocation to an area  not  under  al-Shabaab
         control with her husband on return is likely  to  be  a  reasonable
         option, and not unduly harsh in all the circumstances".

15. There are a  number  of  problems  with  that.  First,  it  involves  a
    transposition of the standard of proof. The question  was  not  whether
    internal flight was "likely to be reasonable"  it  was  whether  it  is
    "reasonably likely to be unreasonable". The second is that  it  is  not
    underpinned by any reference to the evidence - the Tribunal finds, with
    absolutely no justification, that the Appellant  would  be  "likely  to
    find another role as a  translator  in  another  area"  but  given  the
    specialised nature of her profession it is difficult to see where  that
    might be. The third is that it fails to take into account  all  of  the
    foregoing arguments about risk, and the acceptability under the Refugee
    Convention of expecting the Appellant to sacrifice  her  profession  in
    order to secure her safety.  The  fourth,  this  was  not  an  argument
    pursued by the Respondent and fifth, the  Tribunal  nowhere  identifies
    where the 'safe' area in question might be.   Of  these  latter  issues
    the parties before me were at a loss to understand where  the  Tribunal
    might have had in mind, this place where the Appellant could work as  a
    Turkish interpreter but remain safe from  al-Shabaab.  Mr  Tan  thought
    perhaps it might be a reference to the other neighbourhood of Mogadishu
    where the Appellant took refuge with her cousin; Ms  Khan  thought  the
    decision refers to an unspecified area outside of Mogadishu.  That  the
    parties were unable to agree on what the decision means  is  perhaps  a
    good indication that this finding is flawed for lack of  clarity.   For
    all of those reasons, I am  satisfied  that  the  finding  on  internal
    flight cannot stand.    I set aside the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    and re-make the decision by allowing the appeal.

    Anonymity Order

16. This appeal concerns a claim for protection.  Having had regard to Rule
    14 of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decision

17. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.

18. There is an order for anonymity.

19. I re-make the decision in the appeal as follows: the appeal is  allowed
    on protection grounds.
