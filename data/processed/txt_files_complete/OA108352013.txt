Representation:

For the appellant:     Ms J Campbell, instructed by 1st Call Immigration
Services
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Christian Antony  Rodriguez  Siguentes,  date  of  birth
    12.4.85, is a citizen of Peru.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Gurung-Thapa promulgated 13.5.14 dismissing  his  appeal  against
    the decision of the  respondent,  dated  3.4.13  to  refuse  him  entry
    clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom  the  partner  of  Natalie   Louise
    Rodriguez, pursuant to appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge
    heard the appeal on 15.4.14.

 3. First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Grant  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.7.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 24.10.14as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Gurung-Thapa should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The  appellant  lived  (mostly  unlawfully)  in  the  UK  from
    November 2004 until his  voluntary  departure  in  December  2012.  The
    appellant and the sponsor have been in a relationship  since  2006  and
    have a child together. At the date of the appeal  hearing  the  sponsor
    was expecting the appellant's second child, born by  the  date  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing.

 7.  The  application  was  refused  because  of  failure  to  provide   an
    undertaking in relation to accommodation and maintenance  as  requested
    under S-EC.2.4, which  meant  that  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    suitability requirements of EC-P.1.1.(c).  This  is  fatal  to  further
    consideration of Appendix FM. In  addition,  the  appellant  failed  to
    demonstrate that he met the financial requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules  under  E-ECP  of  Appendix  FM,  with   evidence   meeting   the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE. Consideration was also given to  family
    life of the appellant and his partner and  child.  However,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer found nothing to prevent them  enjoying  family  life
    together in Peru.

 8. At the First-tier Tribunal appeal hearing Ms Campbell accepted that the
    appellant did not meet the requirements of Appendix  FM  and  that  had
    been made clear in the covering letter with the  application.  However,
    it was submitted under article 8 ECHR that the best  interests  of  the
    children were to be with the appellant but not to be removed  from  the
    UK; the decision of the Entry Clearance Officer meant that family  life
    would be extinguished.

 9. Judge Gurung-Thapa made a careful consideration of  the  appellant  and
    his family's circumstances and considered that there were good  reasons
    on the facts of this case to consider article 8 outside the Immigration
    Rules, noting at  ï¿½34  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  failed  to
    consider the best interests of the first child and that a further child
    has been born, whose best interests the judge now had to consider. Both
    children are British citizens. The judge thus  proceeded  to  a  Razgar
    five-step consideration, taking care to address the best  interests  of
    the children as the primary consideration in line with  section  55  of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 and the relevant case
    law, including ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC4 and  Azimi-Moayed  and
    others (decisions affecting children; onward appeals) [2013]  UKUT  197
    (IAC).

10. The judge clearly included a consideration of the best interests of the
    children in conducting  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise.  She
    found that although the best interests are normally  to  be  raised  by
    both parents, the needs of the children were being met by  the  sponsor
    and others. The judge also took into account that the family  life  was
    created at a time when both the appellant and the  sponsor  were  aware
    that his immigration status was precarious. The judge  did  not  accept
    that  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case  family  life   would   be
    extinguished, even though he found that it would not be  reasonable  to
    expect the sponsor and the children to relocate to Peru. In the judge's
    view the balance came down in favour of the refusal of entry clearance.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Grant stated, "The  grounds  of
    application  assert  correctly  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge
    arguably erred in law in that having found exceptional  and  compelling
    circumstances to make an Article 8 assessment  and  having  then  found
    that it is in the  best  interests  of  the  British  children  of  the
    marriage to be raised by both parents and  that  there  is  a  positive
    obligation on the State to facilitate family reunion  she  went  on  to
    dismiss the appeal."

12. The Rule 24 response submits that the judge directly herself  correctly
    to the relevant case law. There is no challenge to  the  decision  that
    there was a good arguable  case  to  consider  article  8  family  life
    outside the Immigration Rules, because of a  failure  to  consider  the
    best interests of the child(ren). "It is clear that here were  no  very
    compelling circumstances in the situation  of  the  appellant  and  his
    partner and children. The circumstances were that he did not  meet  the
    income threshold of the  rules  and  that  this  was  a  situation  not
    uncommon in the slightest."

13. "As the judge found it was open to the sponsor to visit  the  appellant
    in Peru and to support an entry clearance when her  finances  improved.
    The judge accepted that normally the best interests of the  child  were
    to (be) brought up by both parents however the judge concluded that  in
    the present case this was not determinative. Such a finding was clearly
    open to her on the facts."

14. There can be no valid criticism of the  judge's  decision  to  consider
    family life under article 8 ECHR outside the  Rules.  Indeed,  she  was
    required to do so under section 86 of the  2002  Act.  The  judge  gave
    cogent reasons for doing so, the failure to consider the best interests
    of the first child and the need to give similar  consideration  to  the
    second child born after the refusal  decision  but  before  the  appeal
    hearing. In fact, as this is an out of country application,  by  reason
    of section 85A of the 2002 Act the Tribunal was confined to considering
    the circumstances appertaining at the time  of  the  refusal  decision,
    when there was only one child. However, there is little practical legal
    difference between considering  the  best  interests  of  two  children
    rather than just one child and no material error of law arises in  that
    regard, although the appellant's case cannot be considered to have been
    strengthened by the fact of a second child.

15. In MM(Lebanon) and others [2014] EWCA Civ 985 The Court of Appeal  held
    that in setting the maintenance  limits  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    "discharged the burden of demonstrating that the interference was  both
    the minimum necessary and strikes a fair balance between the  interests
    of the groups concerned and the community in general. Individuals  will
    have  different  views  on  what   constitutes   the   minimum   income
    requirements needed  to  accomplish  the  stated  policy  aims.  In  my
    judgment it is not the court's job  to  impose  its  own  view  unless,
    objectively judged, the  levels  chosen  are  to  be  characterised  as
    irrational, or inherently unjust or inherently unfair. In my view  they
    cannot be." There  is  nothing  disproportionate  about  expecting  the
    appellant to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules in relation
    to financial requirements.

16. Even if the  determination  were  to  be  set  aside  and  remade,  the
    requirement that I would have to consider section 117B(3) of  the  2002
    Act, to the effect that it is in the public interest and in  particular
    the interests of the economic well-being of the  UK  that  persons  who
    seek to enter the UK are financially independent because  such  persons
    are not a burden on taxpayers and are better  able  to  integrate  into
    society, effectively closes the  door  on  any  argument  that  such  a
    requirement is disproportionate. There was  and  remains  a  route  for
    entry for a partner and/or parent of a child and it remains open to the
    appellant to make a fresh application. That he has failed to meet those
    requirements  is  a  highly  relevant  factor  in  the  proportionality
    assessment. Article  8  is  not  a  shortcut  to  compliance  with  the
    Immigration Rules. The appellant and his family  are  not  entitled  to
    settle in the UK simply because they have chosen to do  so.  The  judge
    made  the  compelling  point  that  family  life  was  established  and
    developed by choosing to have a child when the appellant was in the  UK
    unlawfully and could have had no legitimate expectation of  being  able
    to do so. Furthermore, no satisfactory explanation was offered for  the
    failure of the sponsor to provide the undertaking requested,  resulting
    in the application being  dismissed  under  the  failure  to  meet  the
    suitability requirements. The appellant and the sponsor  certainly  did
    not help their case by this failure, although ultimately  as  EX1  does
    not apply the application fails in any event for failure  to  meet  the
    financial requirements. The sponsor depends on state benefits.  I  also
    note that although their relationship allegedly started  in  2006,  the
    application was not made for some 6 years and in  order  to  strengthen
    their case, the appellant and the  sponsor  deliberately  waited  until
    after both their marriage and the birth of their child  before  seeking
    to regularise the appellant's immigration status or apply for  a  visa.
    Their actions thus were quite calculated.

17. On the facts of the present appeal, I  find  that  the  judge  properly
    considered all the relevant factors and reached conclusions  for  which
    cogent reasons were given. The best interests of  the  children  to  be
    raised in the UK with the appellant present were taken into account but
    in the event outweighed by those factors weighing against the appellant
    in the proportionality balancing exercise between on the one  hand  the
    article 8 family life rights of the appellant and his child(ren) and on
    the other the legitimate and necessary aim of the State to protect  the
    economic well-being of the UK through objectively  applied  immigration
    control. This was a balancing judgement that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was required to conduct. Whilst a different judge may  have  reached  a
    different conclusion, there was nothing irrational  or  perverse  about
    the conclusions reached on  the  facts  of  this  case,  which  as  the
    Secretary of State has pointed out in the Rule  24  response,  are  not
    uncommon and do not disclose any compelling circumstances.

18. I do not accept the argument  that  on  the  facts  of  this  case  the
    decision could be regarded as unjustifiably harsh or  disproportionate.
    The judge found that there were no insurmountable obstacles  to  family
    life continuing in Peru with the sponsor and the appellant, even though
    she found it was not reasonable to expect the sponsor and the  children
    to relocate. Although they cannot be required or expected to do so,  it
    remains open to the sponsor and her children to  continue  family  life
    with the appellant in Peru. That is a matter for  them,  but  an  issue
    that they must surely  have  canvassed  when  deciding  to  form  their
    relationship and have children.

19. In the circumstances, the determination discloses no material error  of
    law and in effect the grounds are an attempt to reargue the appeal.

Conclusion & Decision:

20. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.






Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
