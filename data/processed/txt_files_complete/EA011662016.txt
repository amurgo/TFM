For the Appellant:     Mr D Coleman, instructed by TMC Solicitors Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   By agreement this appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is  remitted
    for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, to take place either at
    Hatton Cross or Taylor House.  It is common ground that the judge erred
    as contended in the grounds of appeal, and as a consequence the  matter
    requires to be reheard in full, hence the remittal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.



No anonymity direction is made.
