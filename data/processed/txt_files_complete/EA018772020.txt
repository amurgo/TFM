                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


The appellant is represented by Adam Bernard Solicitors.

The parties agree that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  and  that  the
appeal should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be redetermined.

The First-tier did err. At the very least the Judge should  not  have  ruled
that the marriage was a marriage of convenience when the Respondent had  not
raised the point without first giving the Appellant an opportunity  to  deal
with the concerns.

Notwithstanding the protracted history, redetermination  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal is appropriate as  redetermination  in  the  Upper  Tribunal  would
restrict the appellant's rights of appeal which, I find, would be unfair  in
this case.

Pursuant to rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008,
with the agreement of the parties, I set aside the decision  of  the  First-
tier Tribunal and direct that the appeal be heard again  in  the  First-tier
Tribunal.
