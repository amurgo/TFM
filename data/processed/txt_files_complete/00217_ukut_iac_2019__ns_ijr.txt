The 21-day time limit  in  rule  29(1)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008 for filing an acknowledgment of service in  immigration
judicial review proceedings begins to  run  on  the  day  after  the  person
concerned is provided with a copy of the application  for  judicial  review,
not on the day it was sent. A copy that is sent by post will  be  deemed  to
have been provided on the second business day after it  was  posted,  unless
the contrary is proved.


                 Decision of the Honourable Mr Justice Lane

Following consideration of all documents filed, including the  letter  dated
21 June  2019  from  the  applicant's  representatives,  the  Tamil  Welfare
Association (Newham) UK.

The respondent's acknowledgment of service,  filed  on  20  June  2019,  was
filed within the period of 21 days specified in rule 29(1) of  the  Tribunal
Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.


Reasons:

1. The applicant contends that the respondent's acknowledgment  of  service,
filed on 20 June 2019, was filed outside the period of 21 days specified  in
rule 29(1) of the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008.  The
respondent asserts that it was served within that period. If  the  applicant
is correct, it is  common  ground  that  the  respondent  has  not  made  an
application, accompanied by the requisite fee, for time to be extended.


2. So far as relevant, rule 29(1) provides that:-

    "A person who is sent or provided with a copy  of  an  application  for
    permission" [to bring judicial review proceedings  and  who  wishes  to
    take  part  in  them]  "must  provide  to   the   Upper   Tribunal   an
    acknowledgment of service so that it is received no later than no later
    than 21 days after the date on which the Upper  Tribunal  sent,  or  in
    immigration judicial review proceedings the applicant provided  a  copy
    of the application to that person".

3.  The applicant says that a copy is provided to the  person  concerned  on
the date it is sent to that person. This means the 21-day period  begins  to
run on the day after it was sent, whether or not the person to whom  it  was
sent has received it.

3. The  applicant's  position  necessarily  involves  the  proposition  that
sending and providing amount to the same  thing.  It  is,  however,  evident
from rule 29(1) that  the  legislature  regards  sending  and  providing  as
different. Otherwise, there would have  been  no  purpose  in  SI  2011/2343
inserting the words in square brackets, which occurred on 17  October  2011,
when UTIAC acquired jurisdiction to decide "fresh claim"  judicial  reviews.


4.  Any doubt as to this is dispelled by reading the consultation paper  and
annexes, which the Tribunal Procedure Committee  (TPC)  published  in  2011,
concerning  proposed  changes  to  the  2008  Rules,  consequent  upon   the
assumption by the Upper Tribunal of jurisdiction in "fresh  claim"  judicial
reviews (FCJRs)[1]. The annex  attached  to  the  TPC's  consultation  paper
reveals that the original proposed wording of rule 29 read:

     "... so that it is received no later than 21 days after  the  date  on
    which the Upper Tribunal or in fresh claim judicial review  proceedings
    the applicant sent a copy of the application to that person".


5. The consultation paper, however, made reference to:

     "CPR 58.8(2),  which  allows  a  total  of  23  days  for  lodging  an
    acknowledgment of service (2 days for postal service and 21  days  from
    receipt of the application). Rule 29(1) allows 21 days for this  to  be
    done. The Committee is considering whether to  make  special  provision
    for FCJRs that would maintain the 23 day time limit  or  to  specify  a
    shorter time limit given the nature of FCJRs"

6. The TPC published a reply to the  consultation  responses,  in  which  we
find the following:

    "The  majority  of  respondents  suggested  that  the  CPR  should   be
    replicated in order to avoid having different rules  depending  on  the
    venue". The conclusion of the TPC was  that  it  "agreed  that  it  was
    appropriate to replicate the CPR time limit".

 7. The amendments to rule 29(1) that were eventually  made  in  2011  were,
therefore, intended to reflect CPR 54.8(2)(a),  which  governs  applications
for judicial review in the High Court. CPR 54.8(2)(a)  prescribes  a  period
of 21 days "after service of the claim form" on the  person  concerned.  The
fact that  service  may  not  be  effected  until  that  person  is  put  in
possession of the claim form is made clear by CPR 6.14, which provides  that
a claim form is deemed to  be  served  on  the  second  business  day  after
completion of what is termed  the  relevant  step  under  rule  7.5(1).  For
posting by first class post, the relevant step is "posting".

8.  This legislative background  makes  it  plain  that  the  references  to
providing in the amended rule 29(1) were used in order to keep  fresh  claim
judicial review (and, now, immigration judicial review)  in  step  with  the
relevant High Court time limit.  The  applicant's  interpretation,  however,
would entirely defeat this purpose.

9. In Bhavsar (late  application  for  PTA:  procedure)  [2019]  UKUT  00196
(IAC), the Upper Tribunal examined the  effect  of  amendments  made  by  SI
2018/511 to rule 33 (Application for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
Tribunal) of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal)  (Immigration  and
Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014. The amendments replaced the references  in  rule
33 to "provided" with references to "sent". As the Upper Tribunal  noted  at
paragraph 26 of its decision, the Explanatory Note  to  SI  2018/511  stated
that the replacement of the references was done "in order  to  clarify  that
the time period for an application to be sent to the Tribunal is  calculated
by reference to the date on which the written reasons for the  decision  are
sent to the party making the application".

10. At paragraph 28 of Bhavsar, the Upper Tribunal said:

    "Despite the implication in the Explanatory Note to  SI  2018/511  that
    the substitution of "sent" for "provided" had been made merely in order
    "to clarify" the position, it is, in our view, clear that a substantive
    change had in fact been made.  As a  matter  of  ordinary  language,  a
    person is "provided" with a physical thing when he or she  receives  or
    takes possession of it.  In the present case, that was on 22 June 2018,
    when the appellant's  solicitors  received  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    decision,  along  with  form  IA60.   The  fourteen-day   time   limit,
    accordingly, would have expired on 5 July 2018, but for  the  amendment
    to rule 33 made by SI 2018/511."

11. The account in paragraphs 3 to 7 above of how  rule  29(1)  came  to  be
amended in 2011 underscores the correctness of what  was  said  in  Bhavsar.
Serving and providing are not synonymous (see also: R  (Javed)  v  Secretary
of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC 4426 (Admin)).

12.  It is undoubtedly the fact that something can be provided to  a  person
in a variety of ways, which involve  not  only  sending  the  thing  via  an
intermediary, such as the Royal Mail, but also providing the thing  directly
by hand. If the applicant were correct  in  his  assertion  that  sending  a
thing amounts to providing it on the date of sending,  the  applicant  could
unilaterally shorten the period of 21 days in  rule  29(1)  by  choosing  to
send the copy application, rather than effecting  personal  service  at  the
office of  the  respondent's  legal  representative,  the  Government  Legal
Department. Such an outcome cannot be correct.

13. The references to providing in rule 29(1) are,  nevertheless,  not  free
from difficulty, in that the 2008 Rules contain no  express  provision  like
CPR 6.14, making it clear that a document sent  by  post  by  one  party  to
someone other than the Tribunal is  deemed  to  be  served/received  on  the
second business day after posting. In this regard, it does not  appear  that
section 7 of the Interpretation Act 1978 applies (see Syed  (curtailment  of
leave - notice) [2013] UKUT 00144 (IAC)). It is plainly in the interests  of
the overriding objective in rule 2 to interpret the references to  providing
in rule 29(1) as including the position that a  copy  application  which  is
sent by post is deemed to have been provided  on  the  second  business  day
after it was posted,  unless  the  contrary  is  proved.  Pursuant  to  rule
2(3)(b), that is how the references will be interpreted by the Tribunal.

14. In the application with which I am concerned, the applicant sent a  copy
of the application to the respondent on 29 May 2019. There is no dispute  it
was received by the respondent on 30 May 2019 and  so  deemed  service  does
not arise. In view of what I have said above, it was  on  30  May  that  the
respondent was provided with the relevant document for the purposes of  rule
29(1). The 21-day period therefore began to run on 31 May and  ended  on  20
June, which was the day that the acknowledgment of service was  received  by
the Upper Tribunal.
