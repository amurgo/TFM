Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Seehra of Counsel instructed by Indra
Sebastian, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka, who was born  on  10th  April,
    1987.


Immigration History

2.   The appellant first entered  the  United  Kingdom  on  23rd  September,
    2007, with entry clearance as a student from 5th  September,  2007,  to
    31st October, 2010.  On 16th February, 2011, the appellant was  granted
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student until  25th  June,  2011.
    On 12th April, 2011, he was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post-
    Study Work) Migrant until  12th  April,  2013,  subject  to  conditions
    restricting employment and prohibiting recourse to public funds.

The Appellant's Application

3.   On 28th March, 2013, the appellant  made  a  combined  application  for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant  under  the  points-
    based system.   His  business  plan  was  slightly  confusing,  but  it
    revealed that he  was  going  to  trade  as  'A-Star-Tutors',  offering
    tutoring services to  students  requiring  additional  help  with  GCSE
    biology, chemistry and physics as well as AS/A2 biology.  However,  the
    business  plan  suggests  that  students  will  also  be   tutored   in
    mathematics and languages, apart from sciences and also  suggests  that
    tutoring will be offered to primary school pupils, lower school  pupils
    and to "accounting degree level students".

4.   On 8th May, 2013, the respondent refused to vary the appellant's  leave
    to remain and gave directions for  the  appellant's  removal  from  the
    United Kingdom.  He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his  appeal
    was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Adio, at  Hatton  Cross  on  3rd
    February, 2014.

The Respondent's Refusal

5.   In the respondent's letter of  8th  May,  2013,  she  says,  under  the
    heading, "Appendix A: attributes", the following:-

     "You have claimed 25 points for  Access  to  Funds  as  required  under
         provision (b) of Table 4 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.

         On the basis of the  documents  you  have  provided,  however,  the
         Secretary  of  State  is  not  satisfied  that   these   meet   the
         requirements specified under Appendix A of  the  Immigration  Rules
         and you do not qualify for the award of 25 points in this area.


         The reasons for this decision are detailed below.


         You have claimed  25  points  for  having  accessed  �50,000  under
         provision (b) of Table 4 of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


         You have provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that you  have
         access to at least �50,000.


         As you are applying  under  provision  (b)  of  Table  4,  you  are
         required to demonstrate that  you  meet  the  following  additional
         criteria:


         (i)  are applying for leave to remain,


         (ii) have, or were last granted leave as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work)
         Migrant,


         (iii)    were, on a date falling within  three  months  immediately
         prior to the date of the   application,


             (1)  registered with HM Revenue & Customs as self-employed, or




             (2)  registered as a new business in which he is a director or


             (3)  registered as the director of an existing business,


         (iv)  are  engaged  in  business  activity,  other  than  the  work
             necessary to administer his business, in an  occupation  which
             appears  on  the  list  of  occupations  skilled  to  National
             Qualifications Framework level 4 or above, as  stated  in  the
             Codes of Practice in Appendix J, and  provides  the  specified
             evidence in paragraph 41-SD,


         You have demonstrated that you satisfy (i), and (ii) above.


         For the requirement (iiii) although you  have  provided  copies  of
         Form AP01 and AP03 from Companies House, these  are  not  specified
         documents as stated in the Immigration Rules  to  demonstrate  your
         registration as a Director.  Consequently, we have been  unable  to
         take  these  documents  into  consideration  when  assessing   your
         application.


         Additionally, for requirement (iv) although you have provided a job
         title that is listed in Appendix J, the only evidence that you have
         submitted to demonstrate that you are active in that occupation  as
         part of your business , A-Star-Tutors Limited, is a  business  card
         for A-Star-Tutors Limited which advertises that business.


         However,  that  advertisement  does  not  contain   any   sort   of
         description of the companies business activity, therefore does  not
         meets the requirements as  listed  in  paragraph  41-SD(c)(iii)  of
         Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


         Furthermore, you have provided no contracts detailing the  services
         that your business offers to confirm that you are  engaged  in  any
         business activity as claimed.


         You have also submitted a Memorandum and  Articles  of  Association
         for your business, but this is not a specified  document  and  does
         not confirm that you are engaged in the business as claimed.


         You  have  therefore  not  submitted  the  evidence  specified   at
         paragraph 41-SD(c) of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.


         As you have stated on your application form that no contracts  have
         been submitted, there is no indication  that  any  exist  and  this
         document does not form part of a series  of  documents.   For  this
         reason, we have not requested any additional evidence from  you  as
         per paragraph  245AA(c)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  paragraph
         245AA(b) does not apply to your application.


         As a result of the above, you have not demonstrated that  you  meet
         the requirements of the Rules to be awarded points under  provision
         (b) of Table 4 of Appendix A.


         You have submitted no evidence that you qualify  for  points  under
         any other provisions in Table 4 of Appendix A, for  example  having
         access to �200,000 and, we have been unable  to  award  points  for
         this attribute in accordance with Appendix  A  of  the  Immigration
         Rules."


6.    The  appellant's  application  for  leave  to  remain  as  A  Tier   1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant under paragraph 245DD of HC 395 was,  therefore,
    refused.

7.   The judge found  that  paragraph  41-SD(b)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    requires that specific documents referred to in Table  4  be  supplied.
    The appellant had supplied forms AP01 and AP03, indicating that he  had
    been appointed  a  director  and  company  secretary  of  A-Star-Tutors
    Limited.  However what was required was  that  the  applicant  must  be
    registered as a director of the  business  in  the  UK  and  provide  a
    Companies House document showing the address of the  registered  office
    in the UK , or head office in the UK if he has  no  registered  office,
    and the applicant's name, as it appears on the application form,  as  a
    director.  The judge found that the appellant had not satisfied Table 4
    of Appendix A with reference to paragraph 41-SD under Appendix A of the
    Immigration Rules.  He found that this was not a  situation  where  the
    form supplied was in the wrong format, simply that  the  appellant  had
    not provided the document required at all.  The judge found that  forms
    AP01 an AP03 did not satisfy the requirements of the Rules.

8.   By way of advertisement of his business, the appellant produced a  copy
    of a business card.  This  simply  referred  to  "private  tutor",  the
    appellant's full names and his degree along with his  mobile  telephone
    number, his email  address  and  confirmation  that  he  had  been  CRB
    checked.  It said "AS/A2 biology and GSCE science".  The  judge  found,
    at paragraph 13 of his determination that the appellant  satisfied  the
    requirements of the Rules in this respect, as he had submitted  a  card
    advertising himself as a private tutor, but in  actual  fact  the  card
    appears to relate to  the  appellant,  not  to  A-Star-Tutors  Limited,
    nonetheless the judge accepted this document.

9.   In  his  determination,  Judge  Adio  noted  at  paragraph  14  of  the
    determination that the  appellant  was  required  to  submit  with  his
    application contracts detailing the services that his  business  offers
    to confirm that he is engaged in business activity as claimed.  In  his
    application form in answer to question G23 on page 27,  he  had  ticked
    the box indicating that one or more contracts had  been  supplied  with
    his application.  In fact no contracts were supplied and the  appellant
    accepted in oral evidence before the judge that  he  had  not  supplied
    any.  The judge  found  in  this  respect  he  had  not  fulfilled  the
    requirements of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules.  The judge went on
    to find that the respondent was correct in not exercising discretion in
    favour of the  appellant  under  paragraph  245AAD  and  dismissed  the
    appellant's claim under the Immigration Rules.   The  judge  considered
    the appellant's Article 8 human rights appeal since it had been  raised
    in his grounds of appeal and at paragraph 16 of the determination  said
    this:-


         "16. With regard to Article 8 of the  Human  Rights  Convention  Mr
             Davidson did not argue this point but  it  is  raised  in  the
             grounds of appeal, I am prepared to accept that the  appellant
             has a private life in the United Kingdom as he has  spent  six
             years in the  United  Kingdom.   The  appellant  has  business
             skills to continue his business in  Sri  Lanka.   I  therefore
             find that it would not be disproportionate for  the  appellant
             to return to his country to put to use his qualifications  and
             business experience.  He has spent most of  his  life  in  Sri
             Lanka before coming to the United  Kingdom  and  therefore  it
             would not be disproportionate for the appellant to  return  to
             Sri Lanka."

    The judge dismissed the appeal.


The Appellant's Challenge

10.  The appellant's application for  permission  to  appeal  contained  two
    challenges.  The first suggested that the judge had  erred  by  finding
    that the respondent was correct  in  not  exercising  discretion  under
    paragraph 245AA and the second suggested that the judge  had  erred  in
    his consideration of  Article  8,  because  he  had  not  examined  the
    strength of the appellant's private life.

11.  First-tier Tribunal Judge P  J  G  White  granted  permission,  finding
    himself satisfied that the judge had arguably made an error of  law  in
    concluding that paragraph 245AA of the Immigration Rules did not  place
    the respondent under any obligation to seek  further  clarification  or
    documents from the appellant before making her decision.

12.  The appellant was represented by Ms Seehra of Counsel, who very  kindly
    provided me with a copy of the Immigration Rules as they  were  at  the
    date of decision.  She pointed out that on the respondent's website the
    Immigration Rules, as they were at May 2013, are not available but  she
    confirmed that there was no appreciable difference in  respect  of  the
    Rules as  they  related  to  this  appeal.   Counsel  took  me  to  the
    appellant's business plan, a copy of which  was  contained  within  the
    bundle.  She suggested that as the business plan made clear the company
    has its own website and introduced details of  its  business  card  she
    accepted that the name of the business did not appear on  the  business
    card, although the name of the appellant as a director and as the tutor
    did appear on it.  She pointed out  that  the  website  contained  full
    information about the services offered and that it  was  intended  that
    business card and brochures  using  the  same  design  style  would  be
    provided for each tutor and that advertisements would appear  in  local
    newspapers and on social media.

13.  Counsel told me that there were no written contracts  at  the  date  of
    the appellant's  application.  All  the  contracts  he  had  were  oral
    contracts with  individual  pupils.   They  had  not  been  reduced  to
    writing.  She suggested that the judge had erred because the  Secretary
    of State should have used her  discretion  under  paragraph  245AA  and
    written to the appellant requesting documents.  The appellant  did  not
    have any written contracts at the time of application, but he  provided
    evidence at paragraph 40 of his bundle showing that he was getting work
    from various tutoring agencies.

14.  I examined page 40 of the bundle, which appeared  to  be  a  commission
    form in respect of the appellant from "Personal Tutors".  She confirmed
    that Personal Tutors was not the appellant's business, but she  pointed
    out that this form detailed his commission for work he  had  undertaken
    on behalf of another tutoring company.  She confirmed that this did not
    relate to the appellant's business and could not therefore satisfy  the
    requirement that the appellant produce written contracts.

15.  Counsel suggested that under paragraph 245AA caseworkers  are  required
    to clarify any issues when considering applications and the  caseworker
    could have made enquiries.  There were, Counsel  suggested,  sufficient
    documents to satisfy the Secretary of State and  the  caseworker  could
    and should have used paragraph 245AA to clarify the situation.

16.  I pointed out to Counsel that the document at page  40  of  the  bundle
    did not meet the requirement that  the  appellant  provide  details  of
    contracts.  It merely showed work that he had undertaken on behalf of a
    different tutorial business.

17.  Ms Seehra suggested that the judge  had  failed  to  conduct  a  proper
    assessment of the appellant's private life rights, notwithstanding  the
    fact the appellant's Counsel who appeared on behalf  of  the  appellant
    (not Ms Seehra) had not addressed the charge in respect of  Article  8.
    The judge failed to take account of the fact  that  the  appellant  had
    been in an established business for over a year.  He had spent time  in
    the United Kingdom as a student.   It  could  not  be  shown  that  any
    interference was necessary because the appellant  was  an  entrepreneur
    who brought money into the United Kingdom and  Counsel  suggested  that
    the judge had further erred by failing to refer anywhere to  the  Court
    of Appeal decision in Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v
    Rodrigues [2014] EWCA Civ 2 or to consider the policy attached  to  the
    decision.

18.  Mr Tufan pointed out to me that the appellant  had  failed  to  produce
    any contracts with his application.  He had ticked the  box  indicating
    that contracts were submitted but  none  were  and,  according  to  the
    appellant when he gave evidence before the  First-tier  Tribunal,  none
    were in existence and the  Secretary  of  State  had  not  erred  under
    paragraph 245AA because sub-paragraph (a) makes it quite clear that the
    Entry Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or Secretary of State will
    only  consider  other  documents  that  had  been  submitted  with  the
    application and will only consider documents submitted documents  after
    the application where they meet the requirements of sub-paragraph  (b).
    If the applicant has submitted specified documents in which:-

    (i)  some of the documents in  the  sequence  have  been  omitted  (for
         example, if one bank statement from a series is missing);


    (ii) documents in the wrong format (for example, if a letter is not  on
         letter headed paper as specified); or


    (iii)    a document is a copy and not an original document; or


    (iv) a document does not contain all the specified information.


19.  Here, none of the contracts were submitted and,  it  appears,  did  not
    exist.  The judge did not err.  Rodrigues places no obligation  on  the
    Secretary of State to request all documents from an appellant that were
    not supplied with the application.  So far as Article 8  is  concerned,
    the appellant entered the United Kingdom as a  student  originally  and
    now does not satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules.   There
    is nothing exceptional in Gulshan (Article 8  -  new  Rules  -  correct
    approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT  640  (IAC)  there  were  no  compelling
    circumstances he invited me to dismiss the appeal.  Responding  briefly
    Counsel suggested  that  there  was  simply  no  consideration  of  the
    appellant's private life.  She submitted that the  Secretary  of  State
    was wrong not to use flexibility under paragraph  245AA  to  allow  the
    appeal.

20.  I am grateful to Ms Seehra for her extensive submissions which  I  took
    careful note of.  I do not believe it would be  possible  for  anything
    further to be said on behalf of the appellant.

21.  I have examined the appellant's bundle which  of  course  now  includes
    documents that were not submitted to the Secretary of State.  There are
    now in the  appellant's  bundles  copies  of  two  tutoring  contracts.
    However the contracts that have  been  provided  are  contract  between
    students and with the appellant personally; they are not with  'A-Star-
    Tutors Limited'.   There is a reference in the bundle from one  student
    and while it is signed  and  dated  it  does  not  give  the  student's
    address.

22.   In  the  letter  from  the  appellant's   solicitors   enclosing   the
    application addressed to the UK Border Agency,  they  seek  remind  the
    Secretary of State that she has a

         "Duty to request any further documents you  need  to  process  this
         application.   Therefore,  please  request  for  further   required
         necessary documents and do not refuse this application for any lack
         of document.  Please refer to the evidential flexibility policy".


    I do not believe that the appellant was well-served by his  solicitors,
    who clearly had not familiarised themselves with the flexibility policy
    or with paragraph 245AA.  Had they done so,  they  would  have  ensured
    that the documents which the Immigration Rules required to be submitted
    to the UK Border Agency were in fact enclosed with it.

23.  I do not believe that the judge has erred in law in  his  consideration
    of the appellant's immigration appeal.  The  appellant  had  failed  to
    provide specified evidence which  the  Immigration  Rules  called  for.
    There is no obligation on the  Secretary  of  State  to  provide  legal
    advice to applicants; the evidential flexibility policy and Rule  245AA
    do not cover situations where the Secretary of State requires documents
    to be submitted with an application, but where no such  documents  have
    been submitted.  In this case the reason they were  not  submitted  was
    because they did not  exist.   There  was  no  separate  document  from
    Companies House and while the documents which were  supplied  may  very
    well prove that the appellant  is  registered  as  a  director  of  the
    company, they are not the documents  which  the  Rules  require  to  be
    submitted.  Contracts detailing the services that the  business  offers
    with customers were not in existence at the date of the application and
    indeed it appears from those copy contracts which  had  been  submitted
    that the contracts were not with the company at all,  but  rather  with
    the appellant in his personal capacity.  The Secretary of State had  no
    reason to believe that the specified documents that were  missing  from
    the application ever existed and as it transpired, they never did.

24.  So far as Article 8 is concerned, insofar as the judge failed to  apply
    the Immigration Rules, he was wrong, but the appellant could not  bring
    himself within the requirements of paragraph 276ADE and so any error on
    the part of the judge was not material.  So far as the judge considered
    the Rules under Article 8 jurisprudence, I do not accept that the judge
    has erred.  In my respectful view, there is  nothing  perverse  in  the
    judge's finding at paragraph 16.  He noted that the appellant had spent
    six years in the United Kingdom first as a student and then as a  post-
    study work migrant and was aware from the documents supplied on  behalf
    of the appellant that he had  been  engaged  as  a  tutor  working  for
    various tutoring companies.  Counsel suggested  that  interference  was
    simply not necessary because the appellant is investing �50,000 in  the
    United Kingdom in a new business.  However the appellant failed to meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules and he has no other basis for
    remaining in the United Kingdom.  Given the  considerable  weight  that
    the judge was required to give to the interests of the wider public  in
    the effective maintenance of immigration control, he  was  entitled  to
    conclude as he did.  I have  concluded  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge did not err in  law  in  his  consideration  of  the  appellant's
    Article 8 appeal.

Summary


25.  The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a material point of law.  I uphold the determination.






Upper Tribunal Judge Chalkley
