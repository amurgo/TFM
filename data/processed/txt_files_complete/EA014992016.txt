                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 16th February 1963 is a citizen of Pakistan.  She
    was represented by Mr Hussain.  The Respondent was  represented  by  Ms
    Willocks-Briscoe, a Presenting Officer.

Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2.  The  Appellant  had  made  application  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 to come to the United Kingdom as  a  dependent  family
    member of an EEA national or spouse.   The application had been refused
    on 8th January 2016.  The Appellant had appealed that decision and  her
    appeal  was  heard  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Lodge  sitting  at
    Birmingham on 7th March 2017.  The judge had allowed her  appeal  under
    the 2006 Regulations.

 3. The Respondent had made application for permission  to  appeal  on  the
    basis in summary that findings made by the judge were contradictory  to
    the conclusions that he drew allowing the appeal.  Permission to appeal
    was granted by First-tier Tribunal Gillespie  on  15th  September  2017
    where it was said that  arguably  the  judge  had  failed  to  consider
    whether the purported dependency of the Appellant was  genuine  and  in
    any event failed to give any or any adequate reasons  why  the  several
    indications of deception ought not to be seen  as  fatally  undermining
    the claim of a genuine dependency.  By a  letter  dated  16th  November
    2017 the Appellant's representatives had provided a Rule 24 response to
    the Grounds of Appeal including the Appellant's visit visa  application
    of 2013, the refusal of such application in 2013 and  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Mailer promulgated on 16th  October  2017  in
    respect of the Appellant's husband's application for recognition  as  a
    dependent relative under the same 2006 Regulations.

Submissions on Behalf of the Respondent

 4. Submissions were made in terms of the grounds  within  the  application
    namely that significant concerns  had  been  raised  by  the  judge  on
    evidence and credibility in his  decision,  such  that  the  judge  had
    clearly  concluded  that  the  evidence  had  been  generated  to  show
    dependency rather than a genuine dependency and no adequate reasons had
    been given for his final conclusions.

Submissions on Behalf of the Appellant

 5. It was submitted that the judge had found  against  the  Appellant  but
    without the benefit of the visit visa application and the  decision  of
    the ECO in 2013 and referred me to the documents  within  the  Rule  24
    application.  It was submitted the Respondent had failed to  show  that
    the Appellant had given false evidence at the time of  her  visit  visa
    application and that the Respondent was wrong in continuing  to  assert
    there was any falsity or subterfuge in the case and that in  any  event
    the judge had given reasons for his final decision.

 6. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision to consider
    all matters.  I now provide that decision with my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

 7. The Appellant's application was to come to the UK as  a  family  member
    dependent on an EEA national  or  spouse  under  Regulation  7  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 8. The case of Lim (EEA dependency) [2013] UKUT 00437 deals with the issue
    of dependency and was referred to the judge.  At paragraph 20  of  that
    case the Upper Tribunal said:

         "The jurisprudence of the Court of Justice clearly emphasises  that
         assessment of  dependency  must  take  into  account  the  personal
         situation of the applicant, which might be thought to  entail  that
         dependency cannot simply be deduced from the mere fact  of  receipt
         of financial support by an EEA national or spouse.  This aspect  of
         the jurisprudence might be said to be reinforced by the formulation
         given by the Court of Justice in Jia when it says  that  dependency
         must be interpreted as meaning that proof of the need for  material
         support is required".

 9. At paragraph 21 of the case it was noted that the overriding  principle
    established was that dependency is a matter of  fact  and  reasons  are
    irrelevant.  At paragraph 22 it was noted "The only qualification  that
    the Court of Justice has ever made to this principle is that there must
    not be an abuse of rights".

10. The judge had considered the evidence before him and made a  number  of
    findings of fact at paragraphs 18 to 25.  He then  concluded  in  these
    terms at paragraph 26:

         "Notwithstanding  that  parts  of  the  Appellant's  evidence   are
         unreliable I am satisfied on the documentary evidence that  she  is
         receiving regular financial  remittances  from  her  son.   In  the
         circumstances I am driven to conclude that she  is  dependent  upon
         the Sponsor and is accordingly a dependent parent".

11. The judge appears to conflate receipt  of  financial  remittances  with
    dependency and the use of the term "I am driven to  conclude"  suggests
    he believed that the former (receipt of remittances) inevitably led  to
    the latter (the conclusion of dependency).  It  seems  clear  from  the
    Court of Justice jurisprudence referred to above that dependency cannot
    be deduced simply from the receipt of financial remittances and to that
    extent  the  judge  erred  in  assuming  that  one  led  directly   and
    uncontrovertibly to the other.

12. The question is whether that error was material.  Had the judge made  a
    series of clear factual findings that set out the personal situation of
    the Appellant commensurate with her  being  dependent  then  the  above
    error would not be material because the judge would by  necessity  have
    made the same decision.  However the findings made by the judge in this
    case are significantly short of that  mark.   At  paragraphs  18/19  he
    found  that  the  Appellant  had  employed  subterfuge  in  respect  of
    assertions made on a visit visa application in  2013  namely  that  her
    husband was in Pakistan when he was in the UK, that he had entered  the
    UK on a false passport and that she had misled the Home  Office  as  to
    his status in the  UK.   Whilst  the  Representative  had  argued  such
    factors were not relevant the judge  had  correctly  concluded  he  was
    entitled to have regard to that matter.  That is in accordance  with  a
    fundamental principle laid down by the Court of Justice in these  cases
    as noted at paragraph 25 of Lim "the only qualification that the  Court
    of Justice has ever made to this principle is that there must not be an
    abuse of rights".

13. At paragraph 20 he refers  to  the  evidence  of  money  transfers  and
    receipt of those transfers.  At paragraph 21 he referred to evidence of
    the Sponsor paying the Appellant's household bills.  He  clearly  found
    that evidence less than credible and concluded "the only  point  I  can
    see is in having Mr Ikram's name on the bills is to  generate  evidence
    of dependency".  At paragraph 22 he refers to evidence  suggesting  the
    Appellant's husband had sold the house in Pakistan and that the Sponsor
    needed to pay the rent now existing on that home for the Appellant  and
    her two children to remain living there.  He said "I am satisfied  that
    that is evidentially worthless".  He further concluded:

         "I cannot accept that the Appellant's husband would leave  her  and
         her children in the position of having to find monies to  pay  rent
         upon the house which presumably they have been owners of  for  some
         time.  The letter has all  the  hallmarks  of  being  contrived  to
         advance the Appellant's claim".

    At paragraphs 23 and 24 he referred to a letter indicating the  Sponsor
    paid the medical bills and that  the  Sponsor  and  Appellant  went  on
    pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia together in 2013 (that does  not  appear  to
    have any real relevance to the features  in  this  case).   Finally  at
    paragraph 25 he found that the amounts remitted to the Appellant  (�400
    to �700 monthly) was a very substantial sum given the Sponsor's  income
    of �8,000 per annum.  He does not appear  to  have  drawn  any  further
    conclusions from those observations.

14. In summary,  in  the  relatively  short  paragraphs  of  assessment  of
    evidence the judge had clearly found more than one example of deception
    perpetrated by the Appellant and found core features  of  the  evidence
    relating to dependency i.e. household bills and  property  rent  to  be
    lacking credibility and essentially, as said on more than one occasion,
    a contrivance to advance the Appellant's claims.  Those finding clearly
    suggest the judge believed that deception or an  abuse  of  rights  may
    have been perpetrated but  nevertheless  erroneously  believed  he  was
    bound to find in favour simply because financial remittances  had  been
    made.

15. The Appellant's representatives had introduced fresh evidence before me
    in accordance with Rule 24 essentially to demonstrate  that  the  judge
    was wrong to conclude  at  paragraphs  18/19  that  the  Appellant  had
    employed subterfuge.  The documents before me under Rule  24  were  not
    before the Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   The  representative's
    position can be summarised by their comments  at  paragraph  3  of  the
    covering letter to the Rule 24 application "it  is  concerning  to  see
    that the Respondent continues to mislead the court in thinking that  Ms
    Kausar's husband was in the UK while she was  attempting  to  obtain  a
    visit visa claiming to be dependent upon her husband".  That relates to
    the visit visa application in 2013 and referred to at paragraphs 18 and
    19 of the judge's decision.  In support of this assertion and generally
    the representatives placed in evidence under Rule 24:

      a) The Appellant's visit visa application dated 16th March 2013.

      b) The Entry Clearance Officer's refusal decision 26th March 2013.

      c) First-tier Tribunal appeal decision by Judge Mailer promulgated  on
         16th October 2017 relating to a  dependency  appeal  made  by  this
         Appellant's husband.

16. Clearly this evidence, in particular the decision of Judge Mailer  made
    on 16th October 2017 was not before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  who
    made his decision in March 2017.   There  is  no  evidence  within  the
    decision of Judge Mailer to show that he had been given a copy  of  the
    decision  of  Judge  Lodge  or  necessarily  knew  anything  about  the
    application and appeal process relating to Ms Kauser, the wife  of  the
    Appellant before him.

17. The common denominator in  evidential  terms  between  the  two  appeal
    hearings was the Sponsor son in the UK.  He was the only witness so far
    as I can see in both cases.  The Appellant's visa application  made  in
    March 2013 indicated an intention to visit the UK in  June  2013.   The
    Appellant, Ms Kauser, indicated that her  husband  would  pay  for  her
    visit to the UK and the 150,000 rupees was available for that  purpose.
    She referred to  her  husband  and  herself  having  a  property  worth
    1,32,19,100 rupees.  The case was that her husband was in Pakistan  and
    either directly or by inference that she was dependent upon him.

18. The Sponsor son's evidence in  respect  of  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Mailer relating to the father's case revealed the  following  evidence.
    The Appellant father had entered  the  UK  illegally  (consistent  with
    paragraph 18 Judge Lodge's decision).   The  Sponsor  son  claimed  his
    father had been living  with  him  since  arrival  in  the  UK  and  at
    paragraph 16 of the decision it was noted that he had been with the son
    at an address in Eastleigh since April 2013.  He further  claimed  that
    his father had been a dependant when he had lived in  Canada  prior  to
    coming to the UK (paragraph 13).  He further claimed  that  his  father
    had never worked in Pakistan, brought no savings with him  and  had  no
    income.

19. That evidence needs to be contrasted with  his  evidence  before  Judge
    Lodge where at paragraph 11  he  had  said  his  father's  business  in
    Pakistan was not working out which is why he had to sell the  home  and
    invest money.  He also said his father had come from Canada to  the  UK
    (paragraph 8).

20. In his witness statement in the Appellant's bundle before  Judge  Lodge
    the Sponsor son had asserted at paragraph 4:

      a) My father was in Pakistan at the time of  my  mother's  visit  visa
         application.

      b) My father did indeed enter  the  UK  but  that  was  way  after  my
         mother's application.

21. In summary therefore the  Rule  24  additional  evidence,  rather  than
    clarify matters or indeed demonstrating, as no doubt  hoped,  that  the
    Home Office were wrong to suggest the  Appellant  had  made  misleading
    assertions in her 2013 application, and Judge Lodge had  erred  in  his
    findings at paragraph 18/19, demonstrates something  rather  different.
    The Appellant in her  2013  application  made  in  March  2013  for  an
    anticipated visit in June 2013 said her husband was  in  Pakistan,  had
    150,000 rupees available to her and that they owned a property of  some
    value.

22. The Sponsor son in summary had asserted before Judge Mailer in evidence
    in October 2017:

      a) His father had never worked in Pakistan.

      b) His father had lived in Canada before coming to the UK.

      c) His father had lived with him since arrival in the UK as  far  back
         as at least April 2013 when they lived at Eastleigh.

      d) His father entered the UK illegally.

      e) His father brought no savings with him.

23. The Sponsor son in his evidence before Judge Lodge said:

      a) His father came from Canada before arrival in the UK.

      b) His father's business was not doing well and had sold the house  to
         invest the money.  In his witness statement the  son  had  said  at
         paragraph 4 "my father is currently present  in  the  UK  and  this
         shows that he did indeed enter the country but this was  way  after
         my mother's application".

24. The Rule 24 evidence shows at the very least inconsistency in  evidence
    provided by the Sponsor son in the case before Judge Lodge and the case
    before  Judge  Mailer.   His  evidence  supports  the  fact  that   the
    Appellant's husband was at the  time  of  her  visit  visa  application
    either in Canada or in the UK and at the very least had entered the  UK
    almost  contemporaneous  with  her  application.   His  evidence  would
    indicate that the Appellant's husband did not have monies available for
    the Appellant given his assertions either that  his  father  had  never
    worked or alternatively his business was not doing well and he  had  no
    savings.

25. To that extent the additional evidence served under Rule  24  does  not
    show anything unreliable in the assertions made by the Home Office  and
    the matters thereafter considered by Judge Lodge at paragraphs  18  and
    19 of his decision.  He was entitled to make the findings that  he  did
    at paragraph 19 additional to the findings that he made,  and  referred
    to above, in respect of the other  core  features  of  the  Appellant's
    case.  It does not seem to me likely  that  had  Judge  Lodge  been  in
    possession of the additional evidence served  under  Rule  24  that  it
    would have assisted him in reaching findings on credibility  favourable
    to the Appellant.  On the face of it the evidence of the  Sponsor  son,
    central to both separate appeal hearings in respect of the  Appellant's
    mother  and  father,  would  appear   to   demonstrate   a   worryingly
    inconsistent pattern of evidence  that  would  seem  to  require  close
    scrutiny.  I do not find therefore that the Rule 24  evidence  supports
    submissions made by the Appellant's representatives  nor  leads  me  to
    conclude that assertions  made  by  the  Home  Office  and  potentially
    adopted by Judge Lodge were made in error or were misleading.

26. I find for reasons given above that Judge Lodge had made clear findings
    that he did not accept as credible core  features  of  the  Appellant's
    factual case and additionally that she had employed subterfuge  and  he
    was correct to identify that as relevant (although not  necessarily  an
    overriding factor).  He reached the conclusions  he  did  based  on  an
    erroneous belief that evidence of remittances equated to a  finding  of
    dependency.  He misdirected himself in that  respect  and  his  factual
    findings, such as they were, and the comments that he made in  relation
    to those findings, are it seems inconsistent with the  conclusion  that
    he reached.  Accordingly, had he not misdirected himself, he  may  well
    have reached a different conclusion consistent with  the  findings  and
    comments that he had made in previous paragraphs.  As  indicated  above
    the Rule 24 material,  rather  than  supporting  the  argument  of  the
    Appellant's representatives, would seem to  undermine  the  credibility
    and consistency of the Sponsor in this and the other  case,  such  that
    fears of an  abuse  of  rights  is  perhaps  strengthened  rather  than
    weakened.

Notice of Decision

27. I find a material error of law was  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge in this case such that the matter needs to be  heard  afresh  and
    given that there needs to  be  a  full  assessment  of  the  facts  and
    evidence in this case, it is appropriate that  such  fresh  hearing  is
    returned to the First-tier Tribunal.  I maintain as a finding of  fact,
    which is no longer  in  dispute,  that  the  Appellant  is  indeed  the
    biological mother of the Sponsor son in this case.

    No anonymity direction is made.
