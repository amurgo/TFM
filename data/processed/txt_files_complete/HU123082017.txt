                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Muquit, Counsel, instructed by Malik & Malik
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 5 June 2018 of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Andrew which allowed the appeal of Mr Dardan  against  a
    decision dated 5 October 2017 refusing his human rights  claim  in  the
    context of deportation.

 2. For the purposes of this decision, I refer to the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department as the respondent  and  to  Mr  Dardan  as  the
    appellant, reflecting their positions before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. The appellant is a national of Kosovo, born on 3 January 1988. He  came
    to the UK in 2002 and was granted indefinite leave to remain on 5 April
    2007. On 25 September 2013 he was convicted of a Class A  drug  offence
    and  sentenced  to  42  months  imprisonment.  The  respondent  made  a
    deportation order against him on 3  October  2017,  also  refusing  his
    human rights claim in a decision of the same date.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal found that the appellant met the provisions  of
    paragraph 399A of the Immigration Rules and  Section  117C(iv)  of  the
    Nationality and Immigration Act 2002. In paragraph 15 of  the  decision
    the judge found that the appellant had lived legally in the UK for most
    of his life. In paragraph  16  she  found  that  he  was  socially  and
    culturally integrated. In paragraphs 18 and 23 she found that he  would
    face very significant obstacles to reintegration  in  Kosovo.  None  of
    those findings are  challenged  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  on  which
    permission to appeal was granted,  the  grounds  only  challenging  the
    findings on family life and paragraphs 399/s.117C(v).

 5. Mr Walker conceded that where there is no challenge to the findings  on
    paragraph 399A/s.117C(iv) they must stand and  even  if  there  was  an
    error in other parts of the assessment, that could not have  led  to  a
    different  outcome.  There  is  therefore  no  material  error  in  the
    decision.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does  not  contain  an  error  on  a
point of law and shall stand.
