                        PAULO JORGE De PEREIRA FAVAS
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS (P)

 1. This is  an  appeal  against  the  decision  of  FtT  Judge  Cockerill,
    promulgated on 10 December 2019.

 2. The appellant sought permission on 4 grounds, the headings of which may
    be summarised as:

    [1]  Procedural unfairness, through refusal of an adjournment.

    [2]  Failure to provide clear findings, or adequate reasons, on whether
    the appellant had a right of permanent residence.

    [3]  Incorrect legal test.

    [4]  Proportionality.

 3. Grounds [3] and [4] overlap with [2], and add little.

 4. On 16 January 2020, FtT Judge Osborne found ground [1] to be  arguable,
    but did not restrict the grant of permission.

 5. On 5 May 2020, the UT issued directions with a view to deciding without
    a hearing whether the FtT erred in law and, if so, whether its decision
    should be set aside.  Parties were also given the opportunity to submit
    on whether there should be a hearing.

 6. In a response dated 7 May 2020, the SSHD does not seek a  hearing,  and
    submits, in summary:

      i) the appeal had a long history by the time of the hearing, and there
         was no unfairness in deciding to proceed, for the reasons given  by
         the FtT at [25];

     ii) as the appellant said he was not registered with HMRC, and did  not
         document his work history, adjournment for HMRC records  would  not
         have helped his case;

    iii) as he could not qualify for a higher level of  protection,  grounds
         [1] - [3] failed;

     iv) ground [4] was only a disagreement.

 7. No response has been received from the appellant.

 8. In the circumstances, the UT may now fairly and justly decide the above
    issues, in terms of rules 2 and 34, without a hearing.

 9. The SSHD's submissions are well made.

10. The appellant could have no grievance, as matters stood at the time  of
    the hearing, over not being allowed further delay.

11. In Bano [2019] UKUT 00416 (IAC), the UT said that,  "Unless  unfairness
    has resulted in there being no proper consideration of  their  case  at
    all, appellants who allege procedural unfairness may find it  difficult
    to have a decision set  aside,  without  showing  that  they  may  have
    suffered prejudice through inability to present a better case".

12. The appellant has had even more time, but has not tried to show that he
    had any better a case to present, if given the chance.

13. Given his own evidence, there is no reason to think that  HMRC  records
    might have improved his position.

14. Grounds [2] - [4] go nowhere, unless [1] had been made out, and without
    production of evidence which might have  shown  a  right  of  permanent
    residence.

15. The decision of the FtT shall stand.

16. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.

17. The date of this determination is to be taken as the date it is  issued
    to parties.
