Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Armstrong, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr N Wray of Counsel, instructed by KC Chambers


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1) This is an appeal with the permission of  the  Upper  Tribunal  by  the
    Secretary of State against a decision by a Tribunal comprising Judge of
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  Scott-Baker  and  Mr  A  E  Armitage.    The
    respondent before the Upper Tribunal is Mr Fabio  Tavares,  hereinafter
    referred to as "the claimant".

 2) The claimant was born  on  9  September  1994  and  is  a  national  of
    Portugal.  He appeals against a decision dated 2 September 2013 by  the
    Secretary of State to make  a  deportation  order  against  him.   This
    decision is based on a conviction dated 29 April 2013 for robbery.  The
    claimant was sentenced to a period of detention of 12 months in a Young
    Offender's Institution and required to pay a victim surcharge of  �100.
    He has a number of previous  convictions  dating  back  to  June  2011.
    These include two convictions for possession of cannabis, a  conviction
    for possession of a knife with a blade and a sharply  pointed  article,
    and a conviction in January 2012 for robbery.

 3) The Secretary of State recognised that the  claimant  has  a  permanent
    right of residence in the UK, having lived here in accordance with  the
    EEA Regulations for a continuous  period  of  5  years  or  more.   His
    deportation therefore requires to be justified on  serious  grounds  of
    public policy or public security.

 4) According to the First-tier Tribunal the robbery of which the  claimant
    was convicted in April 2013 was an unplanned and opportunistic  robbery
    in which some force was used on the victim.  A chain was  grabbed  from
    the victim and it had not been recovered.  The claimant was acting with
    a co-defendant.

 5) The Tribunal had before it a pre-sentence report of 17 January 2012 and
    an OASys Report of  30  December  2013.   The  pre-sentence  report  of
    January 2012 is in respect of the first offence of robbery of which the
    claimant was convicted.  The claimant was with a  friend.   An  attempt
    was made to snatch a chain around the victim's neck.   In  his  defence
    the victim punched the claimant, causing him  to  fall  to  the  floor.
    There was then a scuffle in which the victim was punched a further  two
    times by the claimant's  accomplice  before  making  his  escape.   The
    claimant remained at the scene in a disorientated and dazed state where
    he was detained by police officers, who found the victim's chain in his
    trouser pocket.

 6) The OASys Report of December 2013 states  that  the  claimant  had  not
    recognised the impact and consequences of offending on the victim.   It
    was considered that he had been involved in illegal activities  to  get
    money.  His previous conviction for robbery was noted.  It was recorded
    that the claimant had told a previous assessor that he spent a  lot  of
    his free time hanging around with his  peers  on  the  Broadwater  Farm
    Estate.  The writer of the report  considered  that  the  previous  and
    current offences indicated elements of reckless behaviour.  It seems he
    was assessed at being of medium risk both of harm  to  members  of  the
    public and of re-offending.

 7) The Tribunal heard oral evidence from the claimant.  The claimant  said
    he was not in any gang.  At the instigation of his probation officer he
    was looking into courses and apprenticeships.  He had moved to  the  UK
    at the age of 10 and felt British.  The only person with whom he  fully
    conversed in Portuguese was his grandmother.  His Portuguese  was  only
    basic.

 8) The Tribunal also heard evidence  from  the  claimant's  aunt  and  had
    before it a witness statement from the claimant's mother, who  did  not
    attend  the  hearing.   The  Tribunal  noted  that  the  claimant   had
    experienced some difficulties with his mother but were impressed by the
    evidence of his aunt, who is his mother's sister.

 9) The Tribunal had regard to Regulation 21(5) of the EEA Regulations  and
    the relevant case law.   The  Tribunal  noted  that  the  claimant  had
    "strayed into criminal ways" but if he  was  to  be  rehabilitated  the
    chances of success were far greater in the UK than in Portugal  as  his
    close family were living in the UK and he continued to live with  them.
    There was evidence of support  networks  in  the  UK  inasmuch  as  the
    claimant was being supervised by his probation officer.  There  was  no
    evidence of any facilities available to the claimant in Portugal on the
    basis of offences committed in the UK.   The  Tribunal  concluded  that
    taking all of the  circumstances  into  account  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State was not proportionate under Regulation 21(5)(a).

10) The application for permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was made
    on three grounds.  The first was that it  was  not  clear  whether  the
    Tribunal found that the claimant was a present threat to public policy.
     It might be inferred that the Tribunal did  consider  that  he  was  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat because  the  Tribunal
    stated that if he was not a youth offender  then  it  would  have  been
    proportionate to deport him.  It was not clear what the Tribunal  meant
    by the claimant's youth in the context of his offending.  The  offences
    between 2011 and 2013 were committed when he was around 17-19 years old
    and he was sentenced as an  adult  for  robbery  in  April  2013.   The
    findings of the Tribunal on these matters  were  inadequately  reasoned
    and misdirected in law.

11) The second ground was a lack of clarity by the Tribunal as  to  whether
    the evidence in  relation  to  the  prospects  for  rehabilitation  was
    inadequate.   This was described as a vital  issue,  the  treatment  of
    which amounted to further inadequacy of reasoning in the determination.



12) The third ground was that the assessment of  the  claimant's  links  to
    Portugal  were  inadequately  reasoned.   The  evidence  was  that  the
    claimant was a Portuguese citizen, he had visited Portugal three  times
    since 2004.  On one of those occasions he was in the company of many of
    his family members.  He converses in Portuguese  with  his  mother  and
    grandmother in the UK.  He had not forgotten his Portuguese  roots  and
    he has several family members there.  The  claimant  accepted  that  he
    would be able to find work if he went there.  The Tribunal's assessment
    of there being little evidence of any connection to Portugal other than
    a few family members when the claimant  was  younger  was  inadequately
    reasoned.  Furthermore, the Tribunal's  assessment  of  the  claimant's
    ability to speak Portuguese did not reflect the evidence of his need to
    speak the language with his mother and grandmother.

13) It  was  submitted  that  these  defects  rendered  the  assessment  of
    proportionality fundamentally flawed and the  decision  should  be  set
    aside and re-made.

14) Permission to appeal was granted by the Upper Tribunal on the basis  of
    these grounds.

Submissions

15) Appearing before me on behalf of the Secretary of State,  Mr  Armstrong
    relied on the grounds in the application for permission to appeal.  The
    legal framework in relation to rehabilitation  was  derived  from  Essa
    [2013] UKUT 00316.  There was no evidence of rehabilitation in  respect
    of the claimant.  The OASys Report of February 2014 stated that he  was
    of medium risk to the public.  He had offended  on  several  occasions,
    escalating in seriousness.  He  had  no  intention  to  work.   He  had
    resorted to robbery to top up his state  benefits.   The  claimant  was
    aged 18� at the time of the index offence.  The  Tribunal   found  that
    his criminal offending had developed and could be classed  as  personal
    conduct, as recorded at paragraph 111.  The claimant had been convicted
    of two similar offences of using violence to obtain property.  He was a
    cannabis user with low school attendance.

16) Mr Armstrong continued that the claimant had links  to  Portugal.   The
    reasons given by the Tribunal for finding there was little evidence  of
    any connection with Portugal were inadequate.  The decision  should  be
    set aside and re-made.

17) For the claimant, Mr Wray submitted that the Tribunal did  not  err  by
    referring to the claimant as a "youth" at paragraph 110.  Elsewhere  in
    the determination the Tribunal referred to the claimant as a young man.
     The second offence of robbery was committed as an adult  but  all  the
    offences were committed between the ages of 17 and  19.   The  claimant
    had not established an independent life and was still living at home.

18) Mr Wray continued that  the  issue  before  the  Tribunal  was  one  of
    proportionality.  A relevant factor was whether rehabilitation would be
    frustrated by deportation.  The claimant had spent only a limited  time
    in Portugal.  He was being supported by family members in the  UK.   In
    terms of Essa the issue was whether there was a reasonable prospect  of
    rehabilitation and whether deportation would frustrate  this.   It  had
    been accepted that the claimant had been continuously resident  in  the
    UK for over 5 years and had strong family ties here.  In the opinion of
    the Tribunal deportation would frustrate rehabilitation.  The  claimant
    would then remain a serious risk to the public indefinitely.  To regard
    the claimant as continuing to offend but in another member state  would
    defeat the purpose of the EEA Regulations.

19) For the Secretary of State, Mr Armstrong responded  that  there  was  a
    reasonable prospect of rehabilitation in Portugal and the likelihood of
    this was as strong there as in the UK.  It was clear that the  claimant
    had not been rehabilitated in the UK  as  he  had  re-offended  on  six
    occasions.

20) Mr Wray pointed out that only one  of  these  offences  had  led  to  a
    custodial sentence. Mr Armstrong responded that the claimant  had  used
    violence on his victims and this was a  relevant  factor  in  terms  of
    Regulation 21(6).  The claimant had lived in Portugal for over half his
    life.  He had been there on holiday and spoke the language.

Discussion

21) The arguments presented on behalf of the Secretary of State comprise in
    the main  challenges  to  the  Tribunal's  reasoning.   When  analysed,
    however,  these  arguments  more  resemble   disagreements   with   the
    Tribunal's reasoning than arguments  demonstrating  the  inadequacy  of
    this reasoning.  Much of the argument is concerned, for  example,  with
    disagreement over the  weight  given  by  the  Tribunal  to  particular
    aspects of the evidence.

22) Before making its decision the Tribunal carefully  directed  itself  to
    the relevant regulations and case law,  taking  into  account  the  EEA
    Regulations as they stood at the date of the hearing in May 2014.

23) So far as the Tribunal's reasoning is concerned, the Secretary of State
    pointed out that the claimant had lived in the UK for less than half of
    his life.  Although this is  factually  correct  the  more  significant
    factor from the Tribunal's point of view, which they rightly took  into
    account, was that the claimant had come to the UK as a child and he had
    spent his adolescent and teenage years in this country.   The  Tribunal
    took into account that the claimant has a permanent right of  residence
    in the UK and could be removed only on serious grounds of public policy
    or public security, in terms of  Rule  21(3).   Having  regard  to  the
    claimant's offending, the Tribunal clearly concluded at  paragraph  111
    that the personal  conduct  of  the  claimant  represented  a  genuine,
    present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
    fundamental interests of society.  The  Tribunal  recognised  that  the
    fundamental interests of society include the prevention  of  crime  and
    the upkeep of  law  and  order.   The  Tribunal  correctly  identified,
    however, that as well as showing that the claimant's  personal  conduct
    was such a threat, for removal to be justified, the decision had to  be
    proportionate having regard to the circumstances as a whole,  including
    the factors set out in Regulation 21(6).

24) So far as the claimant's age was concerned, the Tribunal  was  entitled
    to take this into account.  A number of the offences of  which  he  has
    been convicted were committed while the claimant was under the  age  of
    18.  The only custodial sentence imposed upon him was for detention  in
    a young offender's institution.  It may have  been  that  the  Tribunal
    partly had in mind when  referring  to  the  claimant  as  a  youth  at
    paragraph 110 that he was still below the age for  imprisonment  in  an
    adult prison.  The other factor the Tribunal took into account was  the
    support the claimant was still receiving from his family and the  scope
    for rehabilitation as he matured.  These were factors that the Tribunal
    was entitled to take into account.  There is no error  of  law  arising
    from the use by the Tribunal of the word "youth" at paragraph 110.  The
    word does not have any technical meaning in this context.

25) The Secretary of State  contended  that  Tribunal  was  unclear  as  to
    whether the evidence relating to rehabilitation was inadequate.  In the
    view of the Secretary of State there was  a  lack  of  clarity  by  the
    Tribunal in considering this issue.  I note that at paragraph  107  the
    Tribunal, referring to the case of Essa, asked in  effect  whether  the
    extent of integration suggested that there  were  reasonable  prospects
    for rehabilitation.  If so, those prospects  could  be  "a  substantial
    relevant   factor"   in   the   balancing   exercise    in    assessing
    proportionality.

26) The Tribunal recorded that the claimant  had  completed  his  custodial
    sentence and his licence had expired.  There  was  a  letter  from  his
    probation officer stating that he had met him on  only  two  occasions.
    He had reported to probation on a  weekly  basis  but  had  missed  two
    offered appointments.  He had provided an  explanation  in  respect  of
    only one of these.  The claimant's timekeeping was  poor  but  when  at
    sessions he was polite and willing to engage.

27) At paragraph 108 the Tribunal took into  account  that  the  claimant's
    family  were  now  anxious  to  support   him   with   "re-integration"
    (presumably meaning rehabilitation).  If he were to return to  Portugal
    it was unlikely that any support facilities such as  supervision  by  a
    probation officer would be in place.  There was no evidence to  support
    the assertion by the Secretary of State that rehabilitation support and
    facilities would be available in Portugal.  The  Tribunal  nevertheless
    noted that the  claimant  had  a  tendency  to  use  violence  and  his
    offending history indicated that he had  not  learned  from  corrective
    measures taken in the past.  He was still at risk of re-offending.

28) From this part of the Tribunal's assessment it may be inferred that the
    Tribunal were not satisfied on the  evidence  that  the  prospects  for
    rehabilitation were a significant factor  in  the  balancing  exercise.
    Nevertheless, the Tribunal concluded that the claimant's prospects  for
    rehabilitation were better in the UK than they would be in Portugal.

29) The Tribunal then  went  on  to  consider  the  claimant's  links  with
    Portugal and reached conclusions with  which  the  Secretary  of  State
    subsequently took issue.  In particular, the Tribunal stated that there
    "was little evidence of any connection to Portugal  other  than  a  few
    family holidays" when the  claimant  was  younger.   The  claimant  was
    fluent in English, more so than in Portuguese.  His access to education
    might be hampered were he having to speak Portuguese.  The Secretary of
    State pointed out that the claimant still had relatives in Portugal but
    this was not in dispute.  The Tribunal noted that the claimant spoke to
    his grandmother in Portuguese but this was not  inconsistent  with  the
    Tribunal's  findings  about  the  claimant's  language   skills.    The
    Secretary of State further asserted that the  claimant  conversed  with
    his mother  in  Portuguese  but,  according  to  the  mother's  witness
    statement, which was before the Tribunal, she and  the  claimant  spoke
    together more in English than in Portuguese  and  the  claimant  showed
    little interest in  Portugal.   To  say,  as  the  Secretary  of  State
    asserted, that the claimant had not forgotten his Portuguese roots does
    not contradict the Tribunal's finding that there was little evidence of
    any connection to Portugal.

30) The prospect of the claimant's rehabilitation in the UK  was  only  one
    factor, and seemingly not the strongest factor, which the Tribunal took
    into account in its assessment of proportionality.   Under  Rule  21(6)
    the Tribunal was required to take into account of  considerations  such
    as the age, state of health,  family  and  economic  situation  of  the
    claimant, the claimant's length of residence in the UK, the  claimant's
    social and cultural integration into the  UK  and  the  extent  of  the
    claimant's links  with  his  country  of  origin.   The  Tribunal  made
    findings  on  these  matters  and  gave  particular   weight   in   the
    proportionality assessment to the claimant's age, his family situation,
    his length of residence in  the  UK,  the  extent  of  his  social  and
    cultural integration into the UK and  the  extent  of  his  links  with
    Portugal.  On the basis of its findings the Tribunal  was  entitled  to
    conclude that the decision to remove the claimant did not  comply  with
    the principle of proportionality.   In  reaching  this  conclusion  the
    Tribunal did not take into account any irrelevant factor  or  disregard
    any relevant one.  The Tribunal  neither  misapprehended  any  material
    fact nor misdirected itself in law.  Despite strenuously attempting  to
    do so, the Secretary of State has not shown that the reasons  given  by
    the Tribunal are inadequate to support its  conclusions.   Accordingly,
    the Tribunal's decision shall stand.

Conclusions

31) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

32) I do not set aside the decision.

Anonymity

33) The Tribunal did not make any order for anonymity  and  no  application
    has been made to the Upper Tribunal for such an order.  I see no reason
    why such an order should be made.
