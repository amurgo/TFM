                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. This appeal comes before me following my determination of 5 October
         2018 setting aside of the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Courtney which was promulgated on 18 May 2018.

      2. The appellant is a Ghanaian  national  born  on  7  May  1967.  She
         entered the UK as a visitor in 1999 and overstayed. In  March  2011
         she sought a residence card as the spouse  of  one  Robert  Mathias
         Nicolas; that was refused on 12 July 2011. On 20 January 2014,  the
         appellant made an application on private life grounds for leave  to
         remain but that was refused under  paragraph  276ADE  on  11  April
         2014. On 2 September 2016 the appellant sought a residence card  as
         the spouse of another EEA national,  the  current  sponsor,  Mallam
         Mustapha Musa Stokey, whom she married by proxy on 1 November 2015.
         That application was refused on 7 March 2017 because the respondent
         was not satisfied that the  marriage  was  valid  or  that  it  was
         genuine and subsisting.

    The Hearing

      3. The appellant attended the hearing  and  gave  oral  evidence.  She
         confirmed that she lived at 21 [B~] House, although she  could  not
         spell the name of the street,  and  adopted  the  contents  of  her
         witness statement. She stated that she started  to  live  with  the
         sponsor at 54 [O~] Road in 2014; she could not be more specific  as
         to the date. They married in 2015 and then  lived  at  [B~]  House.
         Other than about a year at [O~] Road, they had lived at [B~] House,
         having moved there at the end of 2014 or early 2015. She could  not
         explain why the tenancy agreement commenced in July 2016 (for a one
         year period).  She did not have any other tenancy agreement because
         the landlady "is not charging us much". She said that  her  husband
         paid �200-�300 a month towards the utility bills.

      4. The appellant said her  husband  had  travelled  to  Holland  "last
         week". When asked to be more specific, she replied it had  been  on
         Friday of last week. She called him and he told her he  was  unwell
         with a chest problem. He had sent her a photograph  of  himself  in
         hospital and she had the picture on her mobile phone. He  had  sent
         it on the 5th of December. When it was pointed out to her that that
         would  have  been  before  his  stated  departure  on  Friday,  7th
         December, the appellant said she had meant the Friday of  the  week
         before that. He had not given her a date of discharge.

      5.  The  appellant  confirmed  that  her  marriage  was  genuine   and
         subsisting. They were  trying  to  have  a  baby  and  intended  to
         continue to live together. Her husband had travelled to  Ghana  for
         the proxy marriage. That completed examination in chief.

      6. In response to  Mr  Melvin's  questions,  the  appellant  said  her
         husband did not attend the last hearing because  they  had  had  an
         argument. She was asked if she had any evidence from  the  hospital
         to show that her husband was receiving treatment. She said she  had
         a photograph of him on her phone but no other evidence.

      7. The appellant was asked whether she accepted that  she  had  a  bad
         immigration history. She replied that she did not. It  was  put  to
         her that she had come in 2000 and overstayed. The appellant replied
         she had come in 1999. it was put to her that  she  had  overstayed.
         She replied she came with a visa. It was put to her  that  she  had
         overstayed after the visit visa expired. She replied  she  had  had
         leave for six months.

      8. The appellant was asked about her application in 2009  to  marry  a
         French national. She stated that she did not want to talk about it.
         She was asked why she had not  left  the  country  after  her  visa
         expired or after her application was refused. She replied: "I  love
         the country". She was asked why she did not leave  after  the  next
         unsuccessful application. She replied: "I  love  London".  She  was
         asked whether she would leave if her appeal  failed.  She  replied:
         "This is my country".

      9. The appellant agreed that she had family in Ghana.  She  was  asked
         why she had not sought to marry in the UK. She replied: "He  wanted
         to do it that way". She was asked why she had waited some 12 months
         after the marriage to make her application. She said  she  did  not
         understand. This was the third or  fourth  time  she  had  been  to
         court. She was asked whether she had any supporting witnesses.  She
         replied that she did. She  was  asked  whether  they  had  provided
         witness statements. She remained silent. Mr Unigwe  indicated  that
         he  was  not  aware  of  any  witnesses.   That   completed   cross
         examination.

     10. In re-examination, Mr Unigwe asked the appellant  if  she  accepted
         that she had overstayed her visa. She replied: "My life  is  here".
         The question was repeated. The appellant then replied she did.  She
         was asked whether she had been making attempts  to  regularise  her
         position after she overstayed.  She said she had. She was asked  if
         she had any evidence her husband was in hospital  in  Holland.  She
         replied she only had his picture.

     11. In reply to questions I then put for clarification,  the  appellant
         stated her husband had gone to  attend  a  friend's  wedding.  When
         asked when that had been, she replied it was two weeks ago. She did
         not know which part of Holland he had travelled to. The  visit  was
         supposed to be a week long. He had flown there. She  did  not  have
         any evidence of that. She did not like to ask him questions.

     12. The appellant confirmed that the proxy marriage had taken place  on
         1 November 2015. I asked her to explain why the declaration  stated
         that it had taken place on 12 June 2015. After some  consternation,
         the appellant stated that there had been preparations and "that  is
         what we say". I asked why the declaration gave the matrimonial home
         address as [O~] Road in June  2016  when  it  was  the  appellant's
         evidence that they had been living in [B~] House since the  end  of
         2014. She replied: "I don't use it much. That  is  how  we  do  our
         marriage". I asked the appellant for the name of  her  landlord  at
         [B~] House. She replied it was Awula. I asked who Ubaidi  Khan  was
         (he is named  as  the  landlord  on  the  tenancy  agreement).  She
         repeated that it was Awula. When asked again who Mr Khan  was,  she
         replied he was Awula's brother. I asked when she had stopped paying
         �500 in rent. She replied that was more than a year  ago.  I  asked
         why her husband's address was recorded as [K~] Road in May 2017  if
         he had been living with her at [B~] House. She replied he had  been
         using that address. She could not explain why.  Neither  party  had
         any questions  arising  from  mine  and  that  completed  the  oral
         evidence. There were no other witnesses.

     13. I then heard submissions from the  parties.  A  full  note  of  the
         submissions is set out in my Record of Proceedings.

     14.  Mr  Melvin  submitted  that  having  heard  the  appellant's  oral
         evidence, it was difficult to accept that there  had  ever  been  a
         genuine or subsisting marriage. The appellant had  a  poor  history
         and did not accept that she had done anything wrong by overstaying.
         She had also attempted to deceitfully obtain a  residence  card  on
         the basis of her relationship with a man who was married to someone
         else. There were gaps between trying to regularise  her  stay.  The
         sponsor was elusive and there  was  no  evidence  that  he  was  in
         hospital abroad. The picture could be of anyone. The appellant  was
         deliberately obstructive  in  answering  questions.  There  was  no
         evidence that it  took  5-6  months  to  prepare  for  a  customary
         marriage or to obtain a certificate. There were also  anomalies  in
         the evidence as to the address the appellant and sponsor claimed to
         share. It would have been reasonable to expect  evidence  from  the
         landlord/lady to confirm the current  accommodation.  The  marriage
         was not genuine and subsisting and the  respondent  had  discharged
         the burden to show that. The appeal had to fail.

     15. Mr Unigwe submitted that it was not denied that the  appellant  had
         overstayed her visa but she had taken steps to regularise her  stay
         since then. She said she liked  London.  She  did  not  attempt  to
         deceive anyone. She had married someone who was already married and
         she did not pursue that. Her husband was ill and so had been unable
         to attend but he had attended the error of law hearing. The anomaly
         in the dates of marriage were explained by the time it took to  get
         the marriage done. There were no photographs of their  relationship
         because they did not take pictures.  The  appellant  explained  why
         they had chosen to have a proxy marriage. There was ample  evidence
         to show they resided together: tenancy  agreement,  utility  bills,
         witness statements and the appellant's oral evidence. The appellant
         had been confused which led to her conflicting  evidence.  She  had
         however made out her case on  the  balance  of  probabilities.  The
         refusal was based on an unsubstantiated visit  to  the  matrimonial
         home and the respondent did not  want  to  accept  his  error.  The
         appeal should be allowed.

     16. That completed submissions. At the conclusion  of  the  hearing,  I
         reserved my determination, which I now give with reasons.

     17. Discussion and Conclusions

     18. I have considered all the evidence before me and have had regard to
         the submissions made. I bear in mind that  the  burden  is  on  the
         respondent to show that the appellant has entered into  a  marriage
         of convenience and that the correct standard is one of the  balance
         of probabilities.

     19. My findings are not based  on  the  alleged  visit  by  immigration
         officers to the appellant's home; as  I  already  confirmed  in  my
         previous decision, in the absence of any supporting evidence I  can
         give no weight to  what  is  said  to  have  transpired  during  an
         enforcement visit. My findings are based entirely on the  oral  and
         documentary evidence before me.

     20. I would  state  at  the  outset  that  the  appellant  was  a  very
         unimpressive  witness.  She  was  evasive  and  vague  and   simple
         questions had to be repeated before an answer, not always relevant,
         was forthcoming.  I set out the  reasons  for  this  finding  below
         along with other difficulties that arose from the  material  before
         me.  My  reasons  are  not  given  in  any   order   of   priority.
         Cumulatively, the factors identified led me to  conclude  that  the
         respondent has discharged the burden of showing that  the  marriage
         was and is one of convenience.

     21. The appellant claims to have married the sponsor on 1 November 2015
         by proxy. This was confirmed at the hearing as the correct date  of
         the marriage. The appellant also confirmed  that  her  husband  had
         attended the marriage ceremony. In support  of  the  marriage,  she
         adduced a marriage certificate issued  on  1  December  2015  which
         gives the date of the marriage as 1 November 2015, as stated by the
         sponsor. Difficulties arise, however, between this document and the
         other supporting evidence.

     22. First, I note that the appellant is described as a spinster on  the
         marriage certificate. Plainly  this  is  not  correct  as  she  was
         previously married to a different man and made an application for a
         residence card as a  spouse  in  2009.  The  appellant  refused  to
         discuss the matter at the hearing and I have no information  as  to
         the nature of the marriage or of any confirmation of  annulment  or
         divorce. I am told that the sponsor was present  for  the  marriage
         ceremony but it is not his name and signature that  appear  on  the
         certificate as the husband.

     23. A further difficulty is that the accompanying declaration from  the
         Chief Registrar dated 16 November 2015 makes no mention at  all  of
         the 1 November date but gives the date of the marriage as  12  June
         2015. When this anomaly was put to the appellant, she  could  offer
         no sensible explanation and maintained that this was how  marriages
         were performed and in submissions Mr Unigwe suggested that it  took
         time to obtain the certificate. I can accept that a certificate may
         not be immediately forthcoming and indeed that is borne out by  the
         fact that the certificate is dated 1 December 2015, a  month  after
         the stated date of marriage. The declaration, however, gives a date
         several months earlier. If it  were  the  case  that  the  marriage
         occurred on 12 June 2015, as that document  maintains,  I  have  no
         explanation as to why a different document should give the date  of
         the marriage as 1 November 2015 or why the  appellant  should  have
         stated in oral evidence that  the  latter  date  was  correct.  The
         sponsor's statement maintains  that  the  marriage  was  officially
         registered on  1  November  2015  however  it  is  plain  from  the
         certificate that that date  pertains  to  the  date  on  which  the
         marriage ceremony occurred and not the date of registration.

     24. A further  issue  arising  from  the  declaration  of  16  November
         concerns the place of residence given for  the  appellant  and  the
         sponsor in June 2015. The  declaration  states  that  "both  couple
         lived on the  same  address  at  54  [O~]  Road".  The  appellant's
         evidence to me was, however, that she moved with her  husband  from
         [O~] Road to [B~] House (in fact it is [N~ B~ House) at the end  of
         2014 so it is unclear why some six months later the  wrong  address
         should be given. If the sponsor was present, he  should  have  been
         aware of where he was living at  the  time.  This  matter  was  not
         resolved by the appellant either.

     25. The certification from the First Deputy Judicial Secretary dated 30
         November 2015 confirms the authenticity of the stamp, signature and
         seal of Kodwo Effirim Nunoo (but not the contents of  the  document
         itself), said to appear on the declaration of 16 November 2015. The
         difficulty with this is that it is not  Mr  Nunoo's  details  which
         appear on the declaration but those of one Oppong  Y.  Mensah.  The
         same problem arises from the document issued  by  the  Ministry  of
         Foreign Affairs.

     26. The copy of a page in the  sponsor's  passport,  contained  in  the
         appellant's bundle, does not show that he  was  there  in  November
         2015 or that he was there on 1 June 2015  when,  according  to  the
         declaration, the customary procedure commenced.

     27. The five copied photographs in the bundle  which  purport  to  have
         been taken at the  wedding  are  so  poorly  reproduced  as  to  be
         useless. In any event, they  could  be  of  anyone  at  any  event,
         anywhere. No attempt was made to identify any of the people in  the
         photographs.

     28. When asked why she had chosen a proxy marriage rather than marrying
         in the UK, she said the sponsor wanted to do it that  way.  In  her
         witness statement she gives other reasons.

     29. Therefore, while the Tribunal accepted at the last hearing  that  a
         proxy marriage undertaken in Ghana is valid in the  UK,  there  are
         serious issues arising over  the  reliability  of  the  documentary
         evidence adduced by the  appellant.  These  remain  unresolved  and
         raise concerns over whether a marriage ever took place.

     30. Nonetheless, I now consider the matter on the basis that a marriage
         did take place; whether it was in June or in November 2015 does not
         matter for the following assessment.

     31. The appellant's case is that she met the sponsor in  February  2014
         at a bus stop. Her witness  statement  and  the  sponsor's  witness
         statement contain identical and unusual phrases which suggest  that
         they were not individually prepared. Both maintain that soon  after
         meeting they decided to  get  married  "to  push  our  relationship
         further".  There are at least two other entire paragraphs that  are
         virtually identical (starting with: "I note  with  concern  in  the
         Home Office refusal letter..." and "I have to state here  that  our
         marriage ...").

     32. The appellant maintains in her witness  statement  that  when  they
         decided to live together, soon after meeting, they moved in to  the
         home of a close family friend, Awulatu Ariori. This, I take, is the
         person the appellant stated in evidence was her landlady  -  Awula,
         and with whom she  lives  at  [N~  B~]  House.  There  are  several
         difficulties with this claim. Firstly, the only  tenancy  agreement
         submitted for the [N~ B~] House property names Ubaidi Khan  as  the
         landlord. I take judicial notice of the fact that that  appears  to
         be an Asian name whereas Awulatu does not. After much prevarication
         as to who Ubaidi Khan was, the appellant eventually claimed he  was
         the brother of Awulatu. I do not accept this is likely,  given  the
         problem with the names that I have identified and the fact that  at
         first the appellant had no idea who this  man  was,  only  suddenly
         remembering he was her close family friend's brother after she  was
         pushed for an answer.

     33. The tenancy agreement covers the period from 21  July  2016  to  20
         July 2017 and requires  a  monthly  rental  payment  of  �550.  The
         appellant said that as Awulatu was a close  friend,  there  was  no
         further tenancy agreement, she did not "charge much" and  they  did
         not pay the rent, just �200-�300 towards  bills.  If  that  is  the
         case, there is no explanation for why there was a tenancy agreement
         at all, why it was for the 12 month period stated and why rent used
         to be paid but is no longer required. Nor is it explained  why  the
         appellant gave a different amount for the rent in her oral evidence
         to the First-tier Tribunal (at paragraph 25 of the  determination).
         There is no reliable evidence to confirm  when  the  appellant  and
         sponsor moved into that address. The commencement  of  the  tenancy
         agreement post dates  the  sponsor's  other  evidence  by  some  18
         months, conflicts with the information  in  the  witness  statement
         which was that the couple moved into that  property  shortly  after
         they met in February 2014 and with the  appellant's  oral  evidence
         that they moved there at the end of 2014.

     34. I have had regard to the  utility  bills.  These  raise  even  more
         questions about where the appellant and sponsor  were  living.  The
         gas bills give their address as [O~] Road for the period 1  October
         2014 - 31 December 2014, 1 April 2015 - 30 June  2015  and  1  July
         2015 - 30 September 2015. This does not, however, accord  with  the
         oral evidence of the appellant that they moved from  [O~]  Road  at
         the end of 2014 or with either witness statement that they moved to
         [N~ B~] House when they decided to cohabit. The application  for  a
         residence card made by the appellant on 2 September 2016 gave  [O~]
         Road as her address which is a  further  inconsistency  with  other
         evidence.

     35. What is very strange is that one of the gas bills for [N~ B~] House
         in the names of the appellant and the sponsor covers a period where
         they are paying for utilities at the [O~] Road  address  -  1  July
         2015 - 30 September 2015 (AB: 61 and 64). Stranger  still,  is  the
         fact that the total of both bills is identical and that  the  bills
         show two totals which conflict with each other. The top part of the
         bill, in both cases, gives the amount due  as  �136.76.  The  lower
         half gives the total, in both cases, as �135.76. I  do  not  accept
         that the appellant and sponsor would  be  paying  for  gas  in  two
         separate properties and that the  amount  due  at  both  properties
         would be identical and that the bills would both contain  the  same
         error. I have not been given the originals of  the  bills  and  can
         only conclude from these serious inconsistencies and  peculiarities
         that they have been falsified.

     36. The gas bill for [N~ B~] House commence from 1  July  2015  but  as
         pointed out above, this was  at  a  time  when  the  appellant  and
         sponsor were also paying for gas at [O~] Road and indeed  continued
         to do so until 30 September 2015. Other bills for this address  are
         dated 1 October 2015 - 31 December 2015, 1 January 2016 - 31  March
         2016 and 1 April 2016 - 30 June 2016. other than the identical bill
         of �136.76 for this address and the [O~] Road  address,  there  are
         further problems with the bills for [N~ B~] House.  The  January  -
         March bill is for a total of �189.57 (AB:65), the same total as for
         the April - June bill (AB:66). The latter, however,  also  contains
         another total of �184.84 which conflicts  with  the  amount  stated
         elsewhere on the same bill.  This  appears  to  me  to  be  another
         example of a badly falsified document.

     37. There is no reliable evidence of where the appellant  lives  or  of
         where the sponsor lives. I note that his  pay  slip  for  May  2017
         gives the sponsor's address as 188 [K~] Road. This  is  an  address
         which has never been  mentioned  and  when  asked  to  explain  the
         appellant could only state that "he used this address". There is no
         explanation at all for why he would need to do that.

     38. The sponsor stated that his first job in the  UK  was  with  Optima
         Site Solution from May 2016 until October 2017;  however,  his  pay
         slips for several months during that period are for two differently
         named companies.

     39. The sponsor did  not  attend  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal and the account given to the judge by the  appellant  that
         she had "called him to remind him", did not know  why  he  had  not
         attended and "had changed his behaviour suddenly" differed  to  her
         oral evidence to me which was that they had had an argument. I note
         that the sponsor did not attend the hearing before  me  either.  It
         was said that he had fallen ill when on a trip to  the  Netherlands
         but other than a photograph the appellant claimed he  had  sent  to
         her on her mobile  phone,  there  was  no  evidence  whatsoever  to
         support the claim that  he  was  receiving  treatment  in  a  Dutch
         hospital.  The  appellant  was  contradictory  about  when  he  had
         travelled, there was no evidence of his travels, she did  not  know
         where he was and did not know when he was coming  back.  Mr  Unigwe
         submitted that the sponsor had attended the error of law hearing. I
         have no way of  knowing  who  accompanied  the  appellant  on  that
         occasion  but  certainly  the  sponsor  has  been  absent  on  both
         occasions when his evidence has been required.

     40. For all the reasons given above, I have no  hesitation  in  finding
         that the respondent has discharged the burden of showing  that  the
         marriage is a complete and utter sham. I find that the claim  is  a
         complete fabrication.

     41. I am satisfied that the appellant is determined to remain in the UK
         by whatever means possible and that  she  is  willing  to  lie  and
         deceive the authorities to do so. I note her complete  denial  that
         she had done anything wrong by overstaying since 1999. Although she
         sought to maintain that she had been attempting to  regularise  her
         stay ever since, the evidence is that she  waited  some  ten  years
         before first attempting to do so and then another few years  before
         trying again. She clearly has no respect whatsoever for the laws of
         this country and appears to believe that because she  likes  living
         in London, she has a right to do so.

     42. I find that there was never any genuine or subsisting  relationship
         between her and the sponsor and that there is no intention to  live
         together and start a family and never has been.

     43. I also find that the problems I have highlighted in respect of  the
         gas bills submitted as supporting evidence strongly  indicate  that
         the appellant has relied on forged  documents  and  has  sought  to
         blatantly and cynically deceive the  court.  I  bear  in  mind  the
         standard I must consider to make that finding but there can  be  no
         other answer to the  anomalies  arising  thereof.  It  is  for  the
         respondent  to  decide  whether  to  pursue  the  matter  of  false
         evidence.

     44. Decision

     45. The appeal is dismissed.

     46. Anonymity

     47. I have not been asked to make an anonymity order and see no  reason
         to do so.
