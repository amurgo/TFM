Anonymity
Rule 14: The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
No anonymity order was made by the First-tier  Tribunal.  We  find  that  no
particular issues arise on the facts of this case  that  give  rise  to  the
need for a direction. For this reason no anonymity direction is made.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Background

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. She was  born  on  1  January
       1944. She appeals against the respondent's decision dated 13 May 2014
       refusing her leave to remain on Article 8  ECHR  grounds  and  giving
       notice to remove her to Pakistan. The appeal was dismissed by  First-
       Tier Tribunal Judge Murray by a decision promulgated  on  14  January
       2015 ("the Decision").  The matter comes before the Upper Tribunal to
       determine whether the Decision involved the making  of  an  error  of
       law.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Andrew
       on 4 March 2015 on one ground only -  whether  the  Judge  had  given
       consideration to whether or  not  the  appellant  would  be  able  to
       maintain her links with the community in the UK if she  were  removed
       to Pakistan.  This ground is  hereafter  referred  to  as  Ground  2.
       Before us, Mr Pulman sought to renew the  remainder  of  the  grounds
       (Grounds 1 and 3 to 5).  Mr Bramble objected to  this  on  the  basis
       that the appellant had 4 months from  the  date  of  the  refusal  of
       permission to  appeal  on  those  grounds  and  had  made  no  formal
       application to renew. We indicated that we would hear both parties on
       all grounds and would make a decision  whether  to  admit  them  when
       considering our substantive decision whether the  Decision  contained
       an error of law.

    3. The appellant is aged 71 years.  She arrived in the UK  on  13  April
       2002 with leave to enter as a visitor until 8 May 2002, having  lived
       for the previous 58 years in Pakistan.  She arrived in the UK with  a
       Mr Jamshed and his sister.  However, Mr Jamshed passed away  and  his
       sister returned with the body, leaving the appellant  behind  in  the
       UK.    The appellant did not seek to regularise  her  stay  until  24
       June 2013 when she made an application for leave to remain  on  human
       rights grounds which was refused on 1 August 2013.  She was not given
       a right of appeal at that stage  and  so  her  purported  appeal  was
       struck out as invalid.  The appellant made a further application  for
       leave to remain on 10  April  2014  which  led  to  the  respondent's
       decision which is the subject of this appeal.

    4. The  appellant  has  established  strong  ties  to  friends  and  the
       community in the UK.  She undertakes voluntary and  charitable  work.
       The appellant lives with the Syed  family  and  has  formed  a  close
       relationship with Mr Syed.  Mr Syed provides the appellant with  some
       financial support.

    5. The appellant claims to have lost  all  ties  with  Pakistan  and  in
       particular with her  family.   It  is  her  case  that  her  children
       abandoned her following her husband's death in  2000.   Although  the
       appellant accepts that she had community links in Pakistan before she
       came to the UK, she says that she has not maintained those  contacts.



  Submissions

    6. Mr Pulman, in his skeleton argument, challenged the Judge's  findings
       of fact.  There were, he said, a number of areas where the Judge  had
       failed to make factual findings.  He submitted  that  the  Judge  had
       failed to make findings about whether the  appellant  was  vulnerable
       and naï¿½ve as Counsel had submitted, that no finding had been made  as
       to whether the appellant  had  maintained  contact  with  friends  in
       Pakistan (her case was  that  she  had  not),  that  the  appellant's
       evidence in relation to her children was not just that the  appellant
       did not want to be a burden but also that  her  daughters  considered
       her as such (which the Judge had failed to note) and that no findings
       had been made as to the appellant's relationship with her second  son
       or concerning her current relationship with her first  son  (who  had
       sought to contact her whilst she was in the UK).  Mr Pulman suggested
       that it was for the respondent to show whether the appellant could be
       expected to retain ties in the UK or resume them  in  Pakistan,  once
       the appellant had laid the evidential foundations for her  case  that
       she had no-one to return to in Pakistan and had close ties in the UK.
        The findings were, Mr Pulman submitted, crucial to  the  appellant's
       case.

    7. In relation to Ground 2, Mr  Pulman  submitted  that  the  Judge  had
       addressed only the nature of the ties rather than the actual ties and
       had therefore failed to consider whether the actual ties  in  the  UK
       could be maintained.  The Judge had at [41] indicated that  the  ties
       were "of friendship and community" and as such could  be  established
       elsewhere.  That failed to take account of the effect of  removal  on
       the appellant and those she would leave behind in the UK, and whether
       the  appellant  could  continue,  for  example,  the  same  sort   of
       charitable work in Pakistan.  Mr Bramble  submitted  that  the  Judge
       clearly had regard to the extent of the appellant's ties as  she  was
       required to do [39].  There was no need for the Judge to go into  the
       detail  suggested  at  paragraph  20  of  the  appellant's   skeleton
       argument.  The Judge had acknowledged the  extent  of  the  ties  and
       accorded  weight  to  those  ties  when  considering  the   balancing
       exercise.

    8. The focus of the appellant's Ground 3 and Ground 4  was  the  support
       provided by Mr Syed in the UK and whether that would continue if  the
       appellant were returned to Pakistan.  Mr Pulman  submitted  that  the
       Judge should not have had regard to section 117(3)(b) of the 2002 Act
       when considering the appellant's financial circumstances in the UK as
       support was provided by Mr Syed and she was  not  reliant  on  public
       funds.  Mr Pulman also submitted that the Judge had failed to explore
       in detail Mr Syed's assertion that he would continue support from the
       UK and had not for example examined the  nature  and  extent  of  the
       support which would differ from that  provided  in  the  UK  as,  for
       example, the appellant would not have anywhere to live.   Mr  Bramble
       submitted that the application of section 117B was  not  a  tick  box
       exercise.  What the Judge was required to do  was  consider  all  the
       public interest considerations.  The Judge's approach had to be  read
       also in the context of [40]  -  economic  well-being  included  other
       matters such as obtaining treatment from  the  NHS.   The  Judge  had
       considered the public interest as a whole and there was no  error  in
       that approach.  The Judge was also entitled to find on the  basis  of
       Mr Syed's assertion that he would continue to support  the  appellant
       if she were to return to Pakistan.

    9. Ground 5 concerned the Judge's findings in relation  to  the  support
       which the appellant might obtain from her  family  in  Pakistan.   In
       this  regard,  Mr  Pulman  submitted  that  the  Judge   had   placed
       significant weight on the fact that it was the  appellant's  decision
       to  cease  contact  with  her  family.   He  submitted  that  it  was
       irrelevant if the appellant had chosen to lose contact since  it  was
       not suggested that the appellant had done so for any improper  motive
       such as to enhance her chances of remaining in the  UK.   Mr  Bramble
       pointed out that the Judge had sought to elicit  further  information
       about  the  relationship  with  the  appellant's  family  by  further
       questioning and had clearly been impressed with what had been said in
       the oral evidence. This then fed through to the findings set  out  at
       [31] and the conclusions at [32].  Those conclusions were  borne  out
       on the evidence.

   10. Ground 1 focuses on the meaning of "little weight" for  the  purposes
       of section 117B(4) of the 2002 Act.  Mr Pulman submitted that "little
       weight" could not mean "no weight" and different private lives needed
       to  be  accorded  different  weight  according  to  their   intrinsic
       strength.  He submitted that what was meant by  section  117B(4)  was
       that less weight should be accorded to a private life where that  was
       formed during an unlawful or precarious period of residence than  one
       formed during a lawful or settled period of  residence.   Here  there
       was no dispute that the appellant had been in the UK  unlawfully  for
       the majority of her period of residence. Mr Pulman submitted that the
       Judge had erred in failing to indicate  how  much  weight  should  be
       attached to the appellant's private life at [41] and had also  failed
       at that juncture to mention the duration and strength of the  private
       life which she assessed  to  exist.   Mr  Bramble  pointed  out  that
       section 117B(4) was unqualified in its approach - the section did not
       say "less weight"  but  "little  weight".   The  Judge  had  properly
       formulated the test and made  an  appropriate  comment  that  "little
       weight" should be accorded.  That was the correct test.

  Decision and reasons

   11. We deal first with whether we should allow the  appellant  to  pursue
       those grounds on which permission was refused, namely Grounds 1 and 3-
       5.  The grounds are inter-related.  Furthermore, the  respondent  had
       responded to grounds 1 to 5 in the  Rule  24  statement.   There  was
       therefore no prejudice to the respondent in allowing the appellant to
       pursue all grounds.  Our decision therefore deals with grounds  1  to
       5.

   12. The crux of the appellant's  case  is  that  she  has  established  a
       private life in the UK on the  basis  of  her  length  of  residence,
       involvement in voluntary and charitable work.   She  also  has  close
       community ties in the UK with the Syed family  and  wider  community.
       Mr Syed gave evidence as to the closeness of  the  relationship.   Mr
       Syed also provides the appellant with some financial support  in  the
       UK.  In evidence, he said that he  would  continue  to  provide  that
       support if the appellant were returned to Pakistan.  In  relation  to
       the position in Pakistan, the appellant's case is that she no  longer
       has contact with her children in Pakistan.  She says that one of  her
       sons kicked her out and she did not want to become a  burden  to  her
       children.  Her impression was that her daughters  considered  her  as
       such.  Her other son tried to contact her whilst she was  in  the  UK
       but she refused to speak to him.  She would have no-one to return  to
       in Pakistan and return would be harsh particularly in  light  of  her
       age and vulnerability.

   13. The Judge accepted that the appellant had established a private  life
       in the UK and that the interference with that  private  life  was  of
       sufficient gravity to engage Article 8 [35].   Her  age  was  not  of
       itself a significant obstacle as the appellant was capable of looking
       after herself [32]. The asserted vulnerability of the  appellant  was
       not evidenced beyond a bald assertion but this finding also dispenses
       with the appellant's criticism that this was not considered. The ties
       to the community including voluntary work  and  personal  advice  and
       support to others were accepted [39].  The friendship ties  with  the
       community in the UK were accepted [41].  In relation to Pakistan, the
       Judge accepted that the appellant had not been in  contact  with  her
       family members for a number of years but that  this  was  her  choice
       [32].  One of her sons had tried to contact her whilst she was in the
       UK [30].  On that basis she had not been abandoned  by  her  children
       [30]. The appellant had community links in Pakistan before coming  to
       the UK [30].  Mr Syed gave evidence that he would provide support  to
       the appellant if she were to return to Pakistan [32].  The Judge  had
       regard to section  117B  and  in  particular  the  factors  that  the
       appellant was not financially independent, had not demonstrated  that
       she spoke English and that little  weight  should  be  given  to  the
       appellant's private life because she was in the UK  unlawfully.   The
       issue for the Judge was then  whether  the  decision  to  remove  was
       proportionate or whether the appellant could reasonably  be  expected
       to return to Pakistan to enjoy her private life  there.   It  was  in
       that context that the Judge concluded at [41] as follows:-

           "I am required, by statute to place little weight on  a  private
           life established whilst the Appellant  is  here  unlawfully.   I
           also have taken account of the public interest  in  the  general
           sense, as clarified in Shahzad.  I find that  the  private  life
           ties that she has established here are of the kind that also can
           be established elsewhere, being ties of friendship and community
           ties.  The Appellant had such ties in Pakistan  which  could  be
           rekindled.  She spent the first 58 years of her life  there.   I
           find that in view of  the  Appellant's  refusal  to  attempt  to
           remain in contact with her family in Pakistan, the fact that her
           private life was established whilst she was here unlawfully  and
           the fact that she would have financial assistance to help her re-
           establish in Pakistan,  the  interests  of  immigration  control
           outweigh the Appellant's interests in this  case  and  that  the
           Respondent's decision is a proportionate one"

   14. The Judge accepted that the appellant had established a private  life
       in the UK of sufficient gravity to engage Article 8 ECHR.  The  issue
       was whether that private life - rather than those exact ties -  could
       be expected to be enjoyed elsewhere or whether the effect of  removal
       was sufficiently serious to amount to a breach of Article  8.    That
       is the basis of the Judge's conclusion above.

   15.  The  appellant's  grounds  of  appeal  amount  to  no  more  than  a
       disagreement with the findings of the Judge.  No doubt as  a  counsel
       of perfection, more detail could have been gleaned as to matters such
       as the level and extent of the support which Mr Syed would provide on
       return.  However, it was for the appellant to make out her  case  and
       to draw the Judge's attention to matters which she relied on and  not
       for the Judge (or the respondent) to make it for  her.   No  evidence
       was adduced as to whether her friends and community in the  UK  would
       continue to maintain contact with the appellant if she  were  removed
       to Pakistan (aside the  evidence  that  Mr  Syed  would  continue  to
       support her).  The nature of third party support  is  precarious  (as
       ground 4 recognises) and there is no error  in  the  Judge's  finding
       that the dependency on third party support in the UK meant  that  the
       appellant was not financially independent.  On the clear  meaning  of
       those words, she is not.

   16. The evidence in relation to  family  support  was  that  one  of  her
       children had tried to resume that contact and it was  her  choice  to
       reject it.  It was not an irrational conclusion  to  draw  from  this
       evidence that the appellant could seek  to  resume  that  contact  on
       return.

   17. The matters to which the Judge was obliged to have regard  by  reason
       of section 117B included that  little  weight  was  to  be  given  to
       private life formed when a person was in the UK  unlawfully  or  with
       precarious status.  That is the weight which the Judge said  she  had
       given to the appellant's private life and that was the correct  test.
       The assessment of the strength of  private  life  is  not  judged  by
       reference to the weight to be given to it under section 117B  but  by
       an analysis of what the elements are when looking at  the  extent  of
       family and private life formed.  Here, the private  life  formed  was
       made up of a period of  residence  in  the  UK,  and  friendship  and
       community ties formed during that period.  Those matters were clearly
       considered.

  DECISION

   18. For the above reasons, we find that the First-Tier Tribunal Judge did
       not make an error of law in the Decision.  The Decision is  therefore
       upheld.
