                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Wyman ('the Judge') sent to the parties on  2  April  2020  by
    which the appellants' appeals against the decision of the respondent to
    refuse to grant them EEA Family Permits was refused.  The  respondent's
    decision is dated 15 August 2019.

 2. Upper Tribunal Judge Norton-Taylor granted the appellants permission to
    appeal on all grounds.

Rule 34

 3. This decision is made without a hearing under rule 34 of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 ('the 2008 Rules').

 4. In light of the present need to take precautions against the spread  of
    Covid-19, and the overriding objective expressed at rule  2(1)  of  the
    2008 Rules, and also at rule 2(2)-(4), UTJ Norton-Taylor indicated  his
    provisional  view  that  it  would  be  appropriate  to  determine  the
    following questions without a hearing:

      i) Whether the making of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  involved
         the making of an error of law, and if so

     ii) Whether the decision should be set aside.

 5. The parties were requested to  inform  the  Tribunal  if,  despite  the
    directions, a hearing was required. Both parties  confirmed  that  they
    were content for the matter to proceed without a hearing.

 6. The appellant's legal representatives, Law Lane Solicitors, filed short
    submissions by means of email correspondence, dated 13 August 2020.

 7. The respondent filed a response  under  rule  24  of  the  2008  Rules,
    authored by Ms. Aboni, Senior Presenting Officer, dated 25 August 2020,
    confirming that the respondent did not oppose the error of  law  appeal
    made on behalf of the appellants.

 8. I have considered whether it is appropriate to procced with this appeal
    by means of a paper consideration under rule 34.  In  undertaking  such
    consideration, I am mindful as to when an oral hearing is to be held in
    order to comply with the common law duty of fairness  and  also  as  to
    when a decision  may  appropriately  be  made  consequent  to  a  paper
    consideration: Osborn v. The Parole Board [2013]  UKSC  61;  [2014]  AC
    1115. In the circumstances, being mindful of the  importance  of  these
    proceedings to the appellants and to the overriding objective that  the
    Tribunal deal with cases fairly and justly, I am satisfied that  it  is
    just and appropriate to proceed under rule 34.

Anonymity

 9. The Judge did not issue an anonymity direction and no request was  made
    by either party for such direction to be issued.

Background

10. The appellants are a family consisting  of  a  husband,  wife  and  two
    children who are presently aged 6 and 3. They are citizens of Pakistan.
    They applied for EEA Family Permits as dependent family members of  Mr.
    [TS], an Irish national residing in the United Kingdom. Mr.  [S]  is  a
    first cousin of the first appellant, Mr. Muhammad [R]. Mr. [S]  asserts
    that he has been supporting the family in Pakistan since  2014  and  on
    average remits �150 per month to  them.  The  first  appellant  is  not
    employed and asserts that he is unable to find employment.

11. The respondent refused the application by a decision  dated  15  August
    2019. It was accepted  that  Mr.  [S]  is  an  EEA  national,  but  the
    respondent concluded, inter alia:

         'While it is noted that you  have  provided  wire  transfers  dated
         2019, a record of wire transfers dated 2014-18 showing payments  to
         you from your sponsor it is noted that you have  not  provided  any
         documentation that would show that the payments made  to  you  were
         intended for your essential needs.

         It is also noted that you have not provided any evidence  regarding
         your own financial situation  such  as  bank  statements  or  other
         documents including financial ingoing and outgoings. In the absence
         of this evidence this department cannot sufficiently establish your
         dependency, either wholly or partly, upon your EEA sponsor  because
         we are unable to establish if you need the financial  support  from
         the EEA national to meet your essential needs.'

12. The respondent's decision was confirmed by an Entry  Clearance  Manager
    on 15 November 2019.

Hearing Before the FtT

13. The appellants requested that the appeal be considered  on  the  papers
    and it was so considered by the Judge sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  23
    March 2020. The decision was sent to the parties on 2 April 2020.

Grounds of Appeal

14. The appellants rely upon grounds of appeal drafted  by  Mr.  J  Gajjar,
    Counsel, dated 1 July 2020.

15. It is appropriate in this matter to detail  UTJ  Norton-Taylor  reasons
    when granting permission where he stated, inter alia:

         '1.  ... The  respondent  had  accepted  that  the  sponsor  was  a
             qualified person and that he had been  financially  supporting
             the appellants in Pakistan. However, it was not accepted  that
             the financial support had created  relevant  dependency.  This
             conclusion, the respondent had not considered the exercise  of
             discretion under regulation 12(4) of the Regulations.

         2.   Ground 1 is arguable. It appears as though the judge concluded
             that the appellants were relatives of  the  sponsor  who  were
             materially dependent upon him: see [27] and [34]. In light  of
             this, it is arguable that the judge should then have proceeded
             to allow the appeal on the  basis  that  the  appellants  were
             extended  family  members  under  regulation   8(2)   of   the
             Regulations. It would then have been  for  the  respondent  to
             exercise her discretion under  regulation  12.  In  apparently
             exercising that discretion for herself, it  is  arguable  that
             the judge erred in law.

         3.   Ground 2 is arguable. If, contrary to what is  asserted  under
             ground 1, the judge did not accept the issue of dependency, it
             is arguable that she failed to make a clear  finding  in  that
             respect and/or took irrelevant matters  into  account,  namely
             the sponsor's own finances and/or domestic circumstances.

         4.   Paragraph  16  [of  the  grounds  of  appeal]  appears  to  be
             misconceived. Once a person is issued with  a  family  permit,
             they are to be treated as a  'family  member'.  Regulation  13
             would then apply to them. Having said that, the judge was,  in
             respect of the appeal before her, concerned with regulation 8,
             not regulation 13.  Thus,  her  assessment  of  the  sponsor's
             ability to maintain the appellants after arrival was  arguably
             erroneous.

         5.   Ground 3 is also arguable. The points taken by the  judge  may
             have involved procedural  unfairness.  Alternatively,  it  may
             simply  be  that  they  were  irrelevant  considerations  (see
             above).'

16. By means of her rule 24 response the respondent confirmed, inter alia:

         'Although the Entry Clearance Officer accepted the evidence of  the
         appellant receiving remittances from the sponsor,  the  application
         was refused as the appellant had not provided  sufficient  evidence
         that the funds were intended for essential needs and  that  he  and
         his family were dependent on the sponsor.

         The issue before the FTT was therefore that of dependency.

         The SSHD agrees  that  consideration  of  the  sponsor's  financial
         circumstances was not  relevant  to  the  assessing  the  needs  of
         dependency and that the Judge of the FTT failed  to  give  adequate
         consideration  to  the  appellant's  financial  circumstances   and
         whether he was dependent on the remittances  from  the  sponsor  to
         meet essential needs.

         The Tribunal is invited to set aside the  determination  and  remit
         the appeal to the FTT to be heard afresh.'

Decision on Error of Law

17.  Article  3(2)(a)  of  Directive  2004/38  ('the  Citizens  Directive')
    requires the host Member State to facilitate  entry  and  residence  of
    family members other than spouses, civil partners and direct  relatives
    in the ascending or descending line irrespective of  their  nationality
    who, 'in the country from which they  had  come',  were  dependents  or
    members of the household of the Union Citizen having a primary right of
    residence.  Article  3(2)(a)  has  been  transposed   domestically   by
    regulation 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2016 ('the 2016 Regulations').

18. The defining criteria of an extended family member under  regulation  8
    is the requirement for there to be dependency upon the Union citizen or
    to be a member of the Union citizen's household.

19. As confirmed by the CJEU in (C-83/11) Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department v. Rahman EU:C:2012:519, [2013] Q.B. 249 article  3(2)  does
    not require Member States to  grant  every  application  for  entry  or
    residence submitted by family members of an EU citizen who do not  fall
    under the definition in article 2(2) of the Citizens Directive, even if
    they are able to demonstrate dependence on that citizen. The method  of
    entry under this route is therefore discretionary in nature.

20. In (C-1/05) Jia v Migrationsverket EU:C:2007:1,  [2007]  Q.B.  545,  at
    [43], the ECJ  confirmed  that  dependence  under  article  1(1)(d)  of
    Directive 73/148/EEC, a  Directive  concerned  with  the  abolition  of
    restrictions  on  movement  and  residence  within  the  EC,  must   be
    interpreted to the effect that 'dependent on them' meant  that  members
    of the family of a Community national  established  in  another  Member
    State within the meaning of article 43 of  the  EC  Treaty  needed  the
    material support of that Community national or his  or  her  spouse  in
    order to meet their essential needs in the state  of  origin  of  those
    family members or the state from which they came at the time when  they
    applied to join the Community national.

21. In Bigia v. Entry Clearance Officer [2009] EWCA  Civ  79,  [2009]  Imm.
    A.R. 515, a matter concerned with the Citizens Directive, the Court  of
    Appeal confirmed at [24] that where the question of whether someone  is
    a 'family member' depends on a test of dependency, that test is as  per
    [43] of the ECJ's judgement in Jia.

22. In Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341(IAC), [2011] Imm. A.R.
    928 the Tribunal confirmed at [41] and [42]:

         41.  Nevertheless dependency is not the same  as  mere  receipt  of
             some financial assistance from the sponsor. As  the  Court  of
             Appeal made plain  in  SM  (India)  (above)  dependency  means
             dependency in the sense used by the Court of  Justice  in  the
             case of Lebon [1987] ECR 2811. For present purposes we  accept
             that the definition of dependency is  accurately  captured  by
             the current UKBA ECIs which read as follows at ch.5.12:

                  "In determining if a  family  member  or  extended  family
                  member is dependent (i.e., financially dependent)  on  the
                  relevant  EEA  national  for  the  purposes  of  the   EEA
                  Regulations:

                  Financial dependency should be interpreted as meaning that
                  the person needs financial support from the  EEA  national
                  or his/ her spouse/civil partner in order to meet  his/her
                  essential needs - not in order to have a certain level  of
                  income.

                  Provided a person  would  not  be  able  to  meet  his/her
                  essential living needs without the  financial  support  of
                  the EEA national, s/he should be considered  dependent  on
                  that national. In those circumstances, it does not  matter
                  that the  applicant  may  in  addition  receive  financial
                  support / income from other sources.

                  There is no need to determine the reasons for recourse  to
                  the financial support provided by the EEA national  or  to
                  consider  whether  the  applicant  is  able   to   support
                  him/herself by taking up paid employment

                  The person does not need to be living or have lived in  an
                  EEA state which the EEA national sponsor also lives or has
                  lived."

         42.  We of course accept (and as the ECIs reflect) that  dependency
             does  not  have  to  be  "necessary"  in  the  sense  of   the
             Immigration Rules, that is to say an able  bodied  person  who
             chooses to rely for his essential needs on material support of
             the sponsor may be entitled to do so even  if  he  could  meet
             those needs from his or her economic activity ...

23. Consequently, provided a person would not be able to meet  his  or  her
    essential living  needs  without  the  financial  support  of  the  EEA
    national, they should be considered dependent on that national. It  was
    this issue that was before the Judge.  Unfortunately,  I  am  satisfied
    that the Judge did not lawfully engage with it.

24.  UTJ  Norton-Taylor  observed  by  his  grant  of  permission  that  it
    'appeared' that the  Judge  had  concluded  that  the  appellants  were
    'materially dependent' upon Mr. [S] at [27] and [34] of  her  decision.
    By means of their grounds of  appeal,  the  appellants  rely  upon  the
    positive findings made at [34]. The relevant paragraphs of the  Judge's
    decision detail:

         '27.  The  respondent  also  accepts  that  the  sponsor  has  been
             financially supporting the appellant [sic] in Pakistan for the
             past five years. It  is  noted  that  regular  money  transfer
             receipts have been submitted and copies of the same  had  been
             provided.'

         '34. I am therefore not satisfied that if  the  appellant  and  his
             family come to the United Kingdom, they  would  not  become  a
             burden  on  social  assistance.  Given  the  sponsor   himself
             receives significant public funds of over �1,400 per month, he
             is not able to financially support the sponsor  [sic]  without
             becoming a further burden on social assistance. Whilst  it  is
             acknowledged that the sponsor does  send  money  regularly  to
             Pakistan, the standard of living is much cheaper  in  Pakistan
             than it is in the United Kingdom, it is far cheaper to support
             a family of four in Pakistan than in the United Kingdom,  even
             if there was  no  additional  rental  costs.  The  amount  the
             sponsor spends on food, electricity, other utility bills would
             all significantly increase  if  the  sponsor  has  four  extra
             people to support, notwithstanding that he currently  receives
             public funds for his own family.'

25. Neither paragraph addresses the issue before the Judge, namely  whether
    the appellants are dependent upon their sponsor because they  would  be
    unable to meet their  essential  living  needs  without  the  financial
    support provided by the sponsor.  I  am  satisfied  that  [27]  of  the
    decision is simply a summary reciting  of  the  respondent's  decision,
    without identifying the refusal on 'essential  living  needs'  grounds,
    whilst [34] identifies that money is remitted  to  the  appellants  but
    identifies no engagement with the dependency consideration that was  an
    essential element of the appeal.

26. I am also in agreement with the appellants  that  the  Judge  erred  in
    taking irrelevant matters into account when undertaking  an  assessment
    of Mr. [S]'s own finances and personal circumstances.  As  accepted  by
    the respondent, this was not a relevant  consideration  when  assessing
    the issue of dependency.

27. I therefore find  that  the  Judge  materially  erred  in  law  in  her
    consideration of the issue of dependency and in the  circumstances  the
    decision must be set aside.

Remaking the Decision

28. As to the re-making of this decision I note the fundamental  nature  of
    the material errors identified. I have given careful  consideration  to
    the Joint Practice Statement  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  Upper
    Tribunal concerning the  disposal  of  appeals  in  this  Tribunal,  in
    particular paragraph 7.2, and conclude that the effect  of  the  errors
    has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.

29. Consequently, I set aside this decision and remit it back to the First-
    tier Tribunal at Hatton Cross. The appeal fee paid by the appellants is
    for a paper consideration. It is a matter for the appellants to  liaise
    with the First-tier Tribunal if  they  wish  for  their  appeal  to  be
    determined at an oral hearing.

Notice of Decision

30. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision promulgated on 2
    April 2020 pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

31. The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing
    before any judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Wyman.

32. No findings of fact are preserved.
