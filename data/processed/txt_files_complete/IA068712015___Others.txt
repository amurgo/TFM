                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction


   1. Although it is the respondent who is appealing in these proceedings
      for convenience I will continue to refer to the parties as they were
      in the First-tier Tribunal.


   2. The focus in the appeal is on the last appellant. He is the child of
      Mrs BJ and her husband, Mr KTE. Mrs BJ came to the United Kingdom as a
      student in 2010. Her husband joined her as a dependent the following
      year. Their child, Master Emmanuel T was born in the United Kingdom in
      June 2012. All are nationals of India.

   3. The family had leave until September 2012. The day before their leave
      expired application was made for further leave outside the rules. The
      basis for this was that the third appellant needed medical treatment.

   4. The application was refused on 10 September 2013. Their appeal against
      that decision was allowed by First-tier Judge Kempton in a decision
      promulgated on 4 September 2015. This was on the basis of freestanding
      article 8 rights.

   5. The respondent appealed that decision. Following a hearing on a 26th
      of February 2016 Upper Tribunal Judge Rintoul in a decision dated 7
      March 2016 set aside the decision of First tier Tribunal Judge Kempton
      as materially erring in law. The judge directed that the decision be
      remade in the Upper Tribunal. Directions dated 25 May 2015 required
      the adult appellants to set out what further treatment their child
      required and why this would not be available in India.

   6. In order to avoid undue delay a Transfer Order was made on 11 July
      2016 for the appeal to be heard by a differently constituted tribunal.
      Consequently the matter has been listed before me.

At hearing.

   7. The appellants have attended. They were unrepresented. Mr KTE
      explained that they could not afford to pay for representation.


   8.  He said that his son had been born with a poorly developed right
      kidney. He had surgery shortly after birth and then further surgery a
      year later. Since then a third procedure was carried out. He said that
      his son attends the hospital every few months so that ultrasound
      checks on his kidney can be carried out. He is prescribed antibiotics
      and sodium. He said the family had not paid for this treatment.


   9. Mr KTE said there has been a recent diagnosis of autism. He attends a
      mainstream school.

  10. He confirmed that he and his wife are qualified nurses in India.
      Because of their absence they would have to retrain. Wages are low and
      they could not afford to pay for treatment for their son. He also said
      there was no hospital in their local area. In India he has his parents
      and his father worked as a farmer. He also has brothers and sisters.
      His wife's parents are also alive and she has one brother and a sister
      at home.

  11. In submissions Mr McVeety relied on the decision of EV Philippines.
      The family are from Kerela and the respondent had been able to provide
      details of a facility there specialising in nephrology and urology.

The medical conditions.


  12. The appellants have been able to provide up-to-date medical reports.
      There is a report from a Mr Gopal, consultant paediatric urologist.
      The doctor records that his right kidney is poorly developed and
      contributes only 20% of its total renal function and that he is on
      antibiotics to prevent urinary tract infections. Recently he was found
      not to be emptying his bladder completely. Further investigation
      indicated no abnormality though his medication was changed. It was
      anticipated that he would need further surgery in the future and
      remain under the care of consultants until he was 16 years old and
      then he would transfer to the adult services. The doctor said that
      children born with this condition need long-term surveillance. The
      underlying problem is one of the main reasons for kidney
      transplantation. Whilst the appellant's kidneys were not perfect they
      were functioning well at the moment.

  13. Emmanuel has been under the care of Dr. Khader, consultant
      paediatrician. He reviewed him at three months and recorded that he
      was generally doing very well and clinical examination was
      unremarkable. He was to continue on sodium and supplements. On review
      in January 2013 he continued to do well and clinical examination
      showed a happy, smiley little baby with no evidence of anaemia,
      cyanosis, clubbing or lymphadenopathy. His parents were advised to be
      vigilant in respect of urinary tract infections. On review in July
      2014 at one-year-old the doctor recorded he was doing really well and
      there were no concerns with the general growth and development.

  14. There was a report from a clinic held on 11 December 2012 by the
      consultant paediatric nephrologist, Dr. Reid. The conclusion was that
      he was doing well and had good growth and normal kidney function.
      There is also a letter from a clinic dated 15 March 2016 from the
      paediatric nephrologist who said the child had only had one urinary
      tract infection which occurred in October 2015.

  15. There also are reports because of delayed speech and language issues.
      There is a letter from a specialist paediatrician following a clinic
      on 24 February 2016 describing features within the autistic spectrum
      but a diagnosis had not yet been made. There is an educational
      psychologist report dated 31 March 2016 that refers to delayed
      communication skills. There is a report from a specialist dated 17
      August 2016 who suspected he came within the autistic spectrum.

  16. There is a statement from the second appellant where he indicates that
      surgery in India would be prohibitively expensive in relation to their
      earnings. He states the minimum wage of registered nurse equates to
      around �100 per month yet surgery can cost �10,000. He also states are
      no schools available for autism.

The jurisprudence.

  17. There is the statutory   duty imposed on decision makers by Section 55
      of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to have regard to
      the welfare of children. The best interests of a child must be a
      primary consideration, although not always the only primary
      consideration; and the child's best interests do not of themselves
      have the status of the paramount consideration. (Zoumbas v Secretary
      of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74).

  18. It is in the best interests of children to be with both their parents.
      Regarding the development of social cultural and educational ties,
      very young children are focussed on their parents rather than their
      peers and are adaptable. Seven years from the age of four is likely to
      be more significant to a child than the first seven years of life.
      (See Azimi-Moayed and others (decisions affecting children; onward
      appeals) [2013] UKUT 197(IAC)). Relevant would be the level of the
      child's integration in the United Kingdom; the length of absence from
      the other country; where and with whom the child was to live and the
      arrangements for looking after the child in the other country; and the
      strengths of the child's relationship with parents or other family
      members which would be severed if the child had to move away.


  19. The presenting officer relies on EV (Philippines) and Others v SSHD
      [2014] EWCA Civ 874 which found that the best interests of the
      children there lay in continuing their education in the United Kingdom
      with both parents remaining . However, the Tribunal had been entitled
      to find that the need to maintain immigration control outweighed the
      children's best interests. The Court of Appeal said it is necessary to
      determine the relative strength of the factors which make it in their
      best interests to remain here; and also to take account of any factors
      that point the other way.



Medical care.

  20. In DM (Zambia) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 474 it was held that there was
      not a high threshold to engage Article 8. The strength of private life
      was relevant to assessing the proportionality of the interference .
      Article 3 however applied only in very exceptional circumstances (see
      D v the United Kingdom - 30240/96 [1997] ECHR 25).In JA (Ivory Coast)
      & ES (Tanzania) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 1353 the Court of Appeal said
      that a "health case" will not necessarily fail under Article 8 because
      it fails to reach the exceptionally high threshold of Article 3.


  21. The United Kingdom's previous assumption of responsibility was not a
      legal obligation but a de facto commitment on compassionate grounds;
      it has a part to play in the assessment of proportionality.


Section 117

  22. Section 117B makes public interest considerations applicable and the
      maintenance of effective immigration control is in the public
      interest. Little weight should be given to a private life established
      by a person at a time when the person is in the United Kingdom
      unlawfully or when their immigration status is precarious.

Consideration


  23. When considering the best interests of Emmanuel there are several
      significant features. The first is that he is not a British national.
      He is only four years old and his focus will be centred on is parents
      rather than outsiders and surroundings. The respondent's intention is
      that he would be removed along with the parents and so the family unit
      would be preserved. There was no evidence of any close family bonds
      beyond his parents in the United Kingdom. In India his parents have
      close family members in their home area who could support them. Both
      parents are trained as nurses and so will be in a position to monitor
      his condition and also to seek employment to provide for him. The
      medical evidence indicates that his kidney function is stable. There
      is medical treatment available in his home area albeit the family may
      have to pay. There may not be the same specialist facilities available
      in his home area in relation to autism. However to date he has been
      able to attend a mainstream school.


  24. There was no assumption of any responsibility by the respondent
      towards him. He was not granted leave for medical purposes. The family
      have not paid for medical treatment. This treatment has been a drain
      on public finances.

  25. Whilst the family were here they were always aware it was on a
      temporary basis. Undoubtedly, they have integrated to an extent and
      built a private life. They speak English and have been in employment.
      However, no evidence has been led of particularly strong and
      entrenched ties. Their private life can be rebuilt in India.

  26. I find the engagement of article 8 is marginal. It is my conclusion
      that when regard is had to the factors set out above and the
      jurisprudence the respondent's decision is proportionate and does not
      breach the family's human rights.

Decision.

The appeal against the respondent's decision to refuse to vary the
appellants leave is dismissed.
