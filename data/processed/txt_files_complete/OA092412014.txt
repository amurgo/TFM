Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Spurling, Counsel, instructed by W Legal Limited
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is  a  citizen  of  Nigeria.  On  April  8,  2014  the
       appellant submitted an application for entry clearance as a  spouse.
       The respondent refused his application initially on July  14,  2014.
       As finances were an issue in this application and  a  challenge  had
       been made to the minimum income requirement  of  ï¿½18,600  a  further
       decision was taken on October 3, 2014. That latter  decision  upheld
       the original decision and further refused the  application  for  not
       meeting the financial requirements  of  the  Rules.  The  respondent
       refused the application under paragraph 320(11)  HC  395  and  under
       Appendix FM as well as finding no exceptional circumstances to allow
       the appeal outside of the Rules.

    2. The appellant appealed that decision  under  section  82(1)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 on August 4, 2014.

    3. The appeal came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Kelly
       (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on June 23,  2015  and  in  a
       decision promulgated on November 26, 2015 he refused the appellant's
       appeal on all grounds.

    4. The  appellant  lodged  grounds  of  appeal  on  December  23,  2015
       submitting the Judge had erred in his approach to paragraph  320(11)
       HC 395, best interests of the child and article 8 ECHR.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Landes on May 27, 2016 finding the grounds arguable.

    6. In a Rule 24 response dated June 14, 2016 the appellant opposed  the
       appeal arguing  the  Judge  had  considered  the  evidence  and  had
       rejected the appellant's arguments and made findings open to him.

    7. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both representatives.

    8. No anonymity direction has been made.

SUBMISSIONS

    9. Mr Spurling adopted his grounds of appeal and  submitted  there  had
       been an error in law. He submitted the three areas where  there  was
       an error in law were:

        a. Approach to paragraph 320(11) HC 395.
        b. The Judge's approach to the best interests of the Child.
        c. Article 8 generally


   10. Mr Spurling argued that the  Judge  had  erred  by  approaching  the
       decision under paragraph 320(11) HC  395  as  if  it  was  mandatory
       rather than discretionary. Whilst the  suitability  requirements  in
       Appendix FM Section S-EC1.4 were not directly relevant they did give
       a yardstick on how the  respondent  should  approach  the  issue  of
       custodial sentences. He submitted  the  Judge  had  demonstrated  in
       paragraphs [23] to [25] of his decision that he had confined himself
       to Wednesbury principles whereas he should have considered more  and
       in particular the fact the conviction was more than seven years old.
       Whilst the Judge accepted criminal conduct dissipated over  time  he
       submitted the Judge had failed to explain how long it would take for
       such conduct to dissipate and merely applied the Wednesbury test  of
       reasonableness.  In  giving  permission  Judge  of  the   First-tier
       Tribunal Landes identified the  Judge  rather  than  using  his  own
       discretion may have merely applied a general reasonableness test and
       in doing so failed to have regard to the fact that under Section  S-
       EC 1.4 where a sentence of under  twelve  months  was  imposed  then
       after five years it should be ignored.

   11. Mr Spurling further argued that the Judge's  findings  in  paragraph
       [21] were wrong in law because  the  Criminal  Court  did  not  make
       deportation orders and had  not  done  since  automatic  deportation
       orders came in over nine years ago. The continued exclusion was akin
       to a deportation order and in upholding the decision under paragraph
       320(11) HC 395 the Judge failed to give regard to the best interests
       of the child.


   12. As far as article 8 ECHR was concerned  Mr  Spurling  submitted  the
       Judge did not assess family life correctly. He  had  been  wrong  to
       find that family life was brittle. This was  a  family  who  despite
       being separated had continued their relationship and there was now a
       child from that relationship. Although he reminded  himself  of  the
       law and, in particular, SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 he failed  to
       consider paragraph [39] of that decision in its totality and  merely
       took into account those aspects that  supported  his  decision.  The
       State had an obligation to promote family life  and  the  Judge  had
       failed to recognise this in his  decision.  The  child  was  in  the
       United Kingdom as was  the  child's  mother  and  whilst  the  Judge
       referred to the best interests of the child in paragraph [32] of his
       decision he failed to state why  those  factors  are  outweighed  by
       negative factors. This was a matter recognised by Judge of the First-
       tier Tribunal Landes who gave permission.


   13. Mr Spurling invited me to grant permission.


   14. Mr Bramble adopted the Rule 24 response  dated  June  14,  2016  and
       submitted there was  no  material  error  in  law.  As  regards  the
       approach  in  paragraph  320(11)  HC  395  he  submitted  the  Judge
       exercised his discretion as evidenced by paragraphs [21] and [23] of
       his decision. He considered the respondent's  approach  was  correct
       and then gave his reasons for doing so and demonstrated  he  had  in
       mind this appellant's circumstances. In his opinion the offence  was
       serious as evidenced by  the  custodial  sentence  imposed  and  his
       decision was not simply on Wednesday principles but based on his own
       assessment of the case.


   15. Whilst the Judge  may  have  approached  the  issue  of  deportation
       incorrectly this did not infect his decision under paragraph 320(11)
       HC 395.


   16. In so far as  article  8  was  concerned  it  was  clear  the  Judge
       considered the best interests of the child along with relevant  case
       law. He argued the Judge's consideration in paragraphs [34] and [35]
       demonstrated he had taken into account all matters and the  decision
       was open to him. He submitted there were no errors in law.


   17. In response Mr Spurling reiterated the points he  had  made  earlier
       and invited me to remit the matter to the First-tier  Tribunal  with
       preserved findings on Appendix FM matters.


   18. I reserved my decision.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   19. The Judge was dealing with a spouse entry clearance appeal.

   20. Both the appellant and sponsor had  provided  the  Tribunal  with  a
       witness statements dated November 28, 2014.  In  his  statement  the
       appellant accepted he had made mistakes in the past "as a young  and
       eager teenager would in search of a better life". He had come to the
       United Kingdom on a visa valid from January 13, 2005  until  January
       13, 2007 but this only enabled him to remain in the  United  Kingdom
       for six months at a time. He was almost 20  years  of  age  when  he
       entered the United Kingdom and by the time he overstayed (as he did)
       he was no longer a "young and eager teenager."


   21. He met the sponsor in 2005 and it seems from the sponsor's statement
       that she knew the appellant had overstayed  because  she  stated  at
       paragraph [7] of her statement that "one  of  the  reasons  for  him
       overstaying his visa was our relationship as he did not wish  to  be
       separated from me despite knowing that he had overstayed his visa."


   22. The Judge noted that in addition to overstaying, he had committed  a
       criminal offence relating to the use of a British passport that  did
       not belong to him. He received a sentence of six months and  despite
       submitting an application to remain in July 2008 he was removed from
       the United Kingdom on November 9, 2008 although he indicates that he
       left  voluntarily.  According  to  his  application  form  he   made
       unsuccessful out of country visit applications on December 23,  2011
       and February 12, 2012.


   23. The respondent concluded that  the  criminal  offence  committed  on
       October  29,  2007  for  which  he  was  sentenced   to   six-months
       imprisonment and his overstay demonstrated he  had  contrived  in  a
       significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Immigration Rules
       and refused his claim under paragraph 320(11) HC 395.

   24. There  was  documentary  evidence  in  two  bundles  (appellant  and
       respondent bundles) before  the  Judge  that  the  relationship  was
       genuine and the sponsor travelled to see the appellant  on  November
       9, 2011, July 16, 2012 and November 4. 2013 when they married. Those
       visits took place in the United Arab Emirates. His  application  was
       submitted when the sponsor was expecting their child and was twenty-
       two weeks pregnant.


   25. It was against this background that the Judge had  to  consider  the
       appellant's appeal. The Judge carefully recorded the background  and
       evidence  in  his  decision   including   Mr   Spurling's   detailed
       submissions. At paragraph  [13]  he  noted  three  factors  that  Mr
       Spurling submitted mitigated the effect  of  his  behaviour  in  the
       United Kingdom and the fact that upholding the decision would be  to
       exclude the appellant from his daughter.


   26. Mr Spurling's first submission is  the  Judge  did  not  demonstrate
       sufficient regard to these factors when considering what to do under
       paragraph 320(11) HC 395. Mr Bramble submits that he  has  not  just
       applied a reasonableness test but has  had  regard  to  the  factors
       before him. Paragraphs [21] to [23] of the decision are the relevant
       paragraphs I must have regard to when considering whether there  has
       been an error in law.


   27. The Judge in refusing the appellant's appeal under paragraph 320(11)
       HC 395 had regard to the following matters:


        a. His poor immigration history. He had deliberately overstayed and
           established a family/private life whilst here unlawfully.
        b. He committed a criminal offence  to  deceive  an  employer  into
           giving him work and to give the  impression  he  was  a  British
           subject and entitled to be here.
        c. He left the United  Kingdom  in  November  2008  and  when  this
           application was submitted in April 2014 he had been out  of  the
           country for 5ï¿½ years.
        d. His attempts to remain and/or enter the United Kingdom  in  July
           2008, December 2011 and February 2012 had been unsuccessful.
        e.  The  effect  of  his  criminal  behaviour  and  sentence  would
           dissipate and mitigate over time.
        f. The circumstances of the offence and the sentence  imposed  were
           significant  despite  the  sentence   being   only   six-month's
           imprisonment.


   28. Mr Spurling's submission is the Judge failed  to  properly  exercise
       his discretion  and  in  effect  simply  endorsed  the  respondent's
       refusal letter.


   29. In PS (paragraph 320(11) discretion: care needed) India [2010]  UKUT
       440 (IAC) the Tribunal held that the decision  maker  must  exercise
       great care  in  assessing  the  aggravating  circumstances  said  to
       justify   refusal   and   must   have   regard   to    the    public
       interest in encouraging those unlawfully in the United Kingdom  to
       leave and seek to regularise their  status  by  an  application  for
       entry clearance. The Tribunal noted the guidance on the  application
       of paragraph 320(11) to be found in Entry Clearance  Guidance  under
       the heading "Refusals", in relation  to  aggravating  circumstances,
       provided that aggravating circumstances includes  using  an  assumed
       identity. The  guidance  goes  on  to  state:  "All  cases  must  be
       considered on their merits, the activities considered in  the  round
       to see whether they meet the threshold  under  paragraph  320  (11),
       taking into account family life in  the  UK  and,  in  the  case  of
       children, the level of responsibility for the breach.


   30. Whilst this is guidance given to entry clearance officers the  Judge
       when considering such cases has to be have regard to the surrounding
       circumstances and whilst Mr Spurling has submitted the Judge  failed
       to do this I am  satisfied  that  he  did.  The  Judge  had  clearly
       recorded the approach advanced to me today by Mr  Spurling,  in  his
       decision, and when he considered whether to exercise his  discretion
       he considered those matters that were relevant.


   31.  Paragraph  320(11)  states  where  the  applicant  has   previously
       contrived in a significant way to frustrate the  intentions  of  the
       Rules by:


        a. overstaying; or
        b. breaching a condition attached to his leave; or
        c. being an illegal entrant; or
        d. using deception in an application for entry clearance, leave  to
           enter or remain  or  in  order  to  obtain  documents  from  the
           Secretary of State or a third party required in support  of  the
           application (whether successful or not);  and  there  are  other
           aggravating  circumstances,  such  as  absconding,  not  meeting
           temporary admission/reporting restrictions or  bail  conditions,
           using an assumed  identity  or  multiple  identities,  switching
           nationality, making frivolous applications or not complying with
           the re-documentation process


   32. In this case the Judge placed great weight on the fact the appellant
       had overstayed a considerable period and had used deception by using
       an assumed identity. This was not a decision written simply  stating
       "I endorse the respondent's refusal letter" but it  was  in  fact  a
       decision that took into  account  submissions  put  forward  on  his
       behalf but ultimately the Judge concluded that he had contrived in a
       significant way to frustrate the intentions of the Rules. The  Judge
       having set out the relevant factors then concluded in paragraph [23]
       that he would not exercise his discretion in the appellant's  favour
       and that was an option clearly open to him.

   33. In  giving  permission  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Landes
       referred to Section E-EC 1.4 of Appendix FM. However, the wording of
       that section differs to the wording in paragraph 320(11) HC  395  as
       it states,


       "The exclusion of the applicant from  the  UK  is  conducive  to  the
       public good because they have been convicted of an offence for  which
       they have been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than  12
       months, unless a period of 5 years has passed since the  end  of  the
       sentence." The test being applied by the Judge in this appeal was not
       "conducive to the public  good"  but  was  in  fact  whether  he  had
       "contrived in a significant way to frustrate the  intentions  of  the
       Rules."


   34. The difference being that Section  S-EC  are  mandatory  reasons  to
       refuse whereas paragraph 320(11) HC 395 is discretionary and as  the
       Judge recognised the longer the period is from the offence the  more
       the effect of it dissipates. The Judge clearly  was  aware  of  this
       when  he  considered  whether  to  exercise  his  discretion  and  I
       therefore find Mr Spurling's first ground of appeal is not made  out
       and the decision to refuse under the Immigration Rules was  open  to
       the Judge.


   35. During the hearing I raised with Mr Spurling  whether  in  fact  the
       Judge had made what I  referred  to  as  possible  Robinson  obvious
       errors particularly in respect of the requirement to have an English
       Language certificate. Appendix  FM-SE(D)  clearly  states  that  any
       specified documents must be submitted with the application form. The
       Judge found the English Language certificate issued  on  August  14,
       2014 met the Rules but as the  application  had  been  submitted  on
       April 8, 2014 then clearly that could not be the case.  The  English
       language certificate was not even obtained until after  the  initial
       refusal letter. The application under the Rules should  have  failed
       and  there  are  potentially  issues  over  the  specified  evidence
       required to meet the financial  requirements.  I  indicated  to  the
       representatives that as there had been no  cross-appeal  this  would
       not have any bearing on my consideration of the error of law  and  I
       simply record these issues by way of completeness.


   36. The second and third grounds of appeal are connected as they related
       to the Judge's approach to the  best  interests  of  the  child  and
       article 8 ECHR. Mr Spurling's submission  was  two-fold  namely  the
       Judge had not properly considered the best interests  of  the  child
       and thereafter he had not carried out the proportionality assessment
       correctly. In giving permission to appeal Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Landes said that the failure by the Judge  to  specifically
       consider the State's positive obligation to respect family life  may
       amount to an error.


   37. It would be wrong to pluck one line from a  decision  especially  in
       circumstances where the article 8 assessment was  addressed  between
       paragraphs [24] and [39] of the decision.


   38. The Judge started by setting out the  test  as  set  out  in  Razgar
       [2004] UKHL 00027 and he  then  referred  to  the  Court  of  Appeal
       decision of SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387. At  paragraph  [27]  the
       Judge specifically refers to what Richards LJ said  and  that  "what
       was in issue in relation to an application for entry  clearance  for
       leave to enter is more in the nature of an  appeal  to  the  State's
       positive obligations under article 8 rather than the enforcement  of
       its negative duty."


   39. Accordingly, to suggest the  Judge  did  not  have  regard  to  this
       positive obligation would be wrong as he had this obligation in  his
       mind before he considered the merits of the application. He expanded
       on what those positive obligations were in  paragraph  [28]  and  at
       paragraph [29] he reminded himself that the interests of  the  child
       had to be considered. The Judge is not required to set out  verbatim
       previous  judgements  although  in  this  case  the  Judge  spent  a
       considerable amount of print doing just  that.  He  demonstrated  an
       engagement with the principles between paragraphs [34] and  [39]  of
       his decision and he then made findings based on those principles.

   40. I remind the parties this was an out of country appeal and when  the
       application was made this child had not even  been  born.   However,
       the Judge clearly allowed some latitude on  the  evidence  and  gave
       reasons why he did not find exclusion disproportionate in this  part
       of his decision. The Judge also had regard to Section  117B  of  the
       2002 Act which he was obliged to do. He had regard  to  the  child's
       age and the  circumstances  in  which  the  relationship  had  begun
       including the fact they married in the knowledge that  he  had  been
       refused permission to remain or entry clearance on three  occasions.
       He also recognised the option available to the parties.


   41. Mr Spurling's submission effectively was to criticise the Judge  for
       refusing the appeal because a child had now been born. If the  birth
       of a child meant all appeals should be allowed  then  existing  case
       law would have to be re-written.


   42. The Judge considered all the factors and gave reasons  for  refusing
       the application under article  8.  He  clearly  had  regard  to  the
       child's best interests as demonstrated by the careful balancing  act
       he undertook. I find no error in the Judge's approach to this issue.



   43. This was a well written decision that followed a hearing where there
       was no Home Office representative. The Judge clearly  was  aware  of
       the issues being  raised  and  addressed  them  accordingly  in  his
       decision. There is no error in law as the  findings  made  were  all
       open to him.




DECISION

   44. The making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
       involve the making of an error on a  point  of  law.  I  uphold  the
       original decision.
