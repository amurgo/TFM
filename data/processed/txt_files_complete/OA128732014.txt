                        (NO ANONYMITY DIRECTION MADE)

                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the appellant:     Mr S Walker, senior presenting officer
For the respondent:    no appearance



1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department  and  the
   respondent is a national of China.  I  shall  however  for  the  sake  of
   convenience,  continue  to  refer  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
   respondent and Ms Junting as the appellant  which  are  the  designations
   that they had before the First-tier Tribunal.


2. The respondent appeals to the Upper Tribunal  against  the  determination
   of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Amin dated 1 December 2015 allowing  the
   appellant's appeal pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


3. Permission to appeal was granted by the First-Tier Judge  Cruthers  dated
   2 February 2016 commenting that the evidence before the Judge as it stood
   may not have been sufficient to meet the requirement set out in  appendix
   FM-SE and that the further bank statements produced at  the  hearing  did
   not comply with the requirement set out in the Rules. It is also arguable
   that in an out of country appeal, non-compliance with the requirements of
   Appendix FM-SE cannot be remedied at the hearing.


   First-tier Tribunal's findings


4. The First-tier Tribunal made the following findings  which  I  summarise.
   The issue in this appeal is whether the appellant has met  the  financial
   requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  respondent  placed  more
   emphasis on the Article 8 claim. The Judge agreed  with  the  appellant's
   counsel that the  appellant  meets  the  financial  requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules because he considered the  decision  of  TR  (ECO-post-
   decision evidence) Morocco  [2005]  UK  IAT  0038.  The  Entry  Clearance
   Officer's decision was correct at the time it was made as  the  appellant
   accepted that he had not met the specified evidence requirements  of  the
   Rules as of that date. The appellant however  provided  evidence  in  the
   form of the appellant's sponsor's further bank statements produced at the
   hearing and this evidence shows what the circumstances were at  the  time
   of the decision and it cast light upon the position, as it then was.


5. Paragraph 27 the Judge stated "I am not satisfied in light  of  the  bank
   statement produced at the hearing that  the  appellant  sponsor  has  not
   provided the missing payslips for December-May 2014. These relate to  his
   employment  with  Nail  Technicians.  This  evidence   shows   that   the
   appellant's income is over 31,000 per annum now but more  importantly  in
   2015 as the evidence shows, the  appellant's  sponsors  income  was  over
   �31,000 per annum now and more importantly  in  2014,  the  date  of  the
   application the appellant's sponsors income was �20,877 per  annum".  The
   Judge also accepted the appellant's sponsor's evidence that he  has  been
   overpaid. The Judge found the sponsor to be a credible witness  and  said
   that she has no reason to doubt his evidence. In any event  even  if  the
   overpayment is  discounted,  the  appellant  still  meets  the  financial
   requirements of the Rules. The appellant did not rely on his income  from
   Saigon Restaurant Ltd. For all the  reasons  the  Judge  found  that  the
   appellant has met the financial requirements of The Immigration Rules and
   her appeal succeeds.


   The grounds of appeal


6. The grounds of appeal state the following which I  summarise.  The  Judge
   has made a material error of law in  the  decision.  The  decision  maker
   references to the fact  that  the  letter  from  the  sponsors  employer,
   Special Nails, did not meet the requirements of  the  specified  guidance
   set out in Appendix FM SE of the Immigration Rules. At  no  point  within
   the decision has  the  Judge  made  any  reference  to  having  seen,  or
   considered, a letter from the sponsors employer,  and  that  it  met  the
   requirements of the Rules as set out in the Immigration Rules. The  Judge
   made an error of law by accepting the appellant  has  met  the  financial
   requirements when she had not produced all of the specified evidence.


7.  The  next  ground  of  appeal  is  that  that  the  Judge  accepted  the
   appellant's further bank statements provided at the  hearing.  The  Judge
   states that they help to demonstrate the  appellant's  income  meets  the
   requirements of the Immigration Rules. Within the Immigration Rules it is
   stated that the  appellant  must  produce  personal  bank  statements  on
   official bank stationery, or be accompanied by a letter from the bank  on
   headed paper if they are electronic personal bank statements.  The  Judge
   has made an error of law  by  accepting  copies  of  bank  statements  as
   evidence supporting the appellant's income when the requirements are that
   original documents must be produced.


   The hearing

8. The appellant or her representative did not attend the  hearing.  On  the
   morning of the hearing, I asked the Usher to call the representatives and
   was informed by the Usher that I  should  determine  the  appeal  on  the
   papers.

   Decision on the error of law

9. The only  issue  in  the  appeal  therefore  is  whether  the  First-Tier
   Tribunal Judge materially erred when he  found  that  the  appellant  had
   satisfied the requirements of s7 of Appendix FM- SE for  entry  clearance
   to the United Kingdom as the spouse of a person present  and  settled  in
   this country.

10. The Judge made a material error of law  in  accepting  the  evidence  of
   copies of the bank  statements  at  the  hearing  and  finding  that  the
   appellant meets the requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration
   Rules.  Appendix  FM  is  a  technical  area  of  the  law  and  all  the
   requirements must be met including a providing original  bank  statements
   and a letter from the employer. The appellant did not  provide  the  same
   and could not therefore have possibly satisfied the requirements  of  the
   Immigration Rules.

11. I find that a material error of law has  not  been  established  in  the
   determination. In the circumstances the respondent's appeal must succeed.
   I remake the decision and find the appellant has not met the requirements
   of the Immigration Rules to be granted leave  to  remain  in  the  United
   Kingdom as she has not provided  the  specified  documents  required  and
   dismiss her appeal.
