                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  with  permission,  by  the
    Appellant  with regard to a determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Mitchell) promulgated on 16th May 2014 by which he dismissed the
    Appellant's appeal against an Immigration Officer's decision to  refuse
    him leave to enter the UK taken on 27th October 2013. The circumstances
    are that the Appellant, a citizen to Pakistan had leave  to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom is a Tier 1 General Migrant. He visited Pakistan and
    was on his return when questioned by an Immigration Office who  decided
    that either false representations had been employed or  material  facts
    not disclosed when he obtained his leave to remain and  on  that  basis
    took a decision to cancel his leave to remain.

 2. The First-tier Tribunal  upheld that  decision  and  the  grounds  upon
    which permission  to  appeal  was  granted  were  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal  had not applied the correct burden of proof  namely  that  it
    rested with the Respondent  and   that  the  Judge  engaged  in  cross-
    examination which amounted to a procedural unfairness.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal Judge who granted  permission  made  the  point
    that  it  would  have  been  more  appropriate  for   the   Appellant's
    representative at the hearing before the First-tier  Tribunal  to  have
    made representations with regard to questioning  by  the  Judge  rather
    than to leave it for an application for permission to appeal.

 4. This matter first came before me on 18th July 2014  to  decide  whether
    the First-tier Tribunal had made an error of law and if so whether  and
    to what extent the determination should be set aside. Having  read  the
    determination I do not find there was any  procedural  unfairness.  The
    judge is entitled to question an Appellant to clarify the situation. It
    is for the Judge to determine the appeal and if the evidence  to  allow
    him to do that has not come out during the hearing then he is  entitled
    to ask questions provided they are done in a neutral and non-aggressive
    way.  In the absence of any objections or submissions to the  Judge  at
    the time I conclude that they were properly put.

 5. However, I was satisfied at that hearing that the  First-tier  Tribunal
    made a material error of law in so far as the  Judge  appears  to  have
    reversed the burden of proof. The burden rests with  the  Secretary  of
    State to show that false representations  had  been  made  or  material
    facts not disclosed. It was not for the Appellant to prove a  negative.
    I therefore set aside the determination and adjourned the matter for  a
    resumed hearing. I did so  because  there  was  a  dearth  of  evidence
    provided by the Secretary of State and  I  directed  the  Secretary  of
    State to provide details of the application  for  leave  to  remain  in
    which it was said the  Appellant  had  made  false  representations  or
    failed to disclose material facts.

 6. At the resumed hearing before me on 26th  September,  although  neither
    representative had the additional documents, they had found  their  way
    to the Tribunal file. Those additional documents were  a  copy  of  the
    landing card completed by the  Appellant,  the  minutes  taken  by  the
    Immigration Officer, the record of the interview with the Appellant and
    a copy of the application for leave to remain. I  therefore  gave  both
    representatives copies of the documents and time to consider them.

 7. The notice of refusal sets out the reason for the Immigration Officer's
    decision. It states that the Appellant held a  residence  permit  which
    had the effect of leave to remain  in  the  UK  as  a  Tier  1  General
    Migrant. It said that the Appellant had failed to provide  a  coherent,
    consistent, credible account of his  self-employed  earnings  from  MAM
    Marketing and Management Services which led him to conclude  that  they
    were not as the Appellant claimed for the  purposes  of  obtaining  his
    leave. The Immigration Officer  noted  that  the  Appellant's  original
    application stated that he made �22,071 net profit of  the  period  1st
    August 2010 to 1 March 2011 (a seven-month period). He  said  that  the
    Appellant had contradicted  that  before  him  by  declaring  that  his
    turnover during that  period  was  between  approximately  �12,000  and
    �15,000. That was further called into question  because  the  Appellant
    now stated that his  business  expenses  during  that  period  totalled
    between �7,532 and �9,632 and thus his pre-tax profit would  have  been
    �7,468 only.

 8. The Immigration Officer then said  that  unusually  the  Appellant  was
    unable to specify an estimate of his self-employed earnings  from  2011
    to 2012 but claimed that his business turnover for the  period  2012  -
    2013 was between �20,000 and �22,000. The Immigration Officer  said  he
    was unable to specify the pre-tax profit that generated  especially  as
    he claimed that this was working for only three clients for between  49
    hours and  74  hours  in  total.  That  represented  earnings  for  the
    Appellant between �270.27 and �448.97 per hour and  he  had  failed  to
    satisfactorily explain why, given such high earnings, he  was  also  in
    full-time employment at a supermarket earning only �9.63 per hour.

 9. The Immigration Officer  went on to state that to further  explain  how
    the Appellant managed to make those earnings he stated that for one  of
    his clients, Unique Solutions Ltd (who provide  catering  and  security
    staff) he had conducted a  "strengths,  weaknesses,  opportunities  and
    threats analysis". However he was unable to provide any  detail  as  to
    how the company obtained their staff; a contradictory  statement  given
    the work he claimed he had done for them.

10. The Immigration Officer  went on to say that the Appellant stated  that
    the second of his clients in 2012 to 2013 was  Fast  Items  Limited  in
    Walthamstow to whom he sold  computer  peripherals  and  also  received
    commission by selling computers although  he  could  not  say  or  even
    estimate how many computers he sold on their behalf.

11. The Appellant stated that his third and final client in 2012 - 2013 was
    AMF Limited in Ilford for whom he provided  a  report  regarding  their
    promotional strategies. His investigation concluded that they should be
    marketing themselves by using "word-of-mouth"  yet  he  was  unable  to
    state what strategy they had used previously.  He  later  claimed  that
    they did not use any previous marketing strategies.

12. Given the contradictions surrounding  the  Appellant's  self-employment
    the Immigration Officer was satisfied that he  had  misrepresented  his
    self-employed earnings in order to obtain leave to remain in the United
    Kingdom and therefore cancelled his continuing leave in accordance with
    paragraph 321(A) of the Immigration Rules.

13. The Appellant had applied for his leave to remain as a Tier  1  General
    Migrant on  the  basis  that  he  was  working  for  Tesco  Stores  and
    additionally was self-employed. The figures he gave for his income  for
    the purpose of that application were figures for the tax year end April
    2013.

14. The issue in the appeal is whether or not the  Appellant  was  in  fact
    self-employed in  addition  to  working  at  Tesco's  and  whether  the
    Immigration Officer was justified  in  his  conclusions  based  on  the
    Appellant's answers at interview. Included in  the  Appellant's  bundle
    were documents from HMRC confirming his income from all sources.  There
    is a tax assessment for the year to 5th April 2011  which  shows  self-
    employment income of �20,717 plus employed income of �14,365. There  is
    then a tax calculation for  the  year  ended  April  2012  which  shows
    employed income of �17,940 and self-employed income  and  dividends  of
    �17,444. There is then a tax calculation for the year 2012 - 2013,  the
    year relied upon in the Appellant's application for  leave  to  remain,
    which shows earned income of �21,259 and self-employed  income  in  the
    form of dividends of �19,055. The dividends represent income  from  his
    limited company.  I am satisfied that he was both  employed  and  self-
    employed for those three years.

15. The source of his income for the seven-month  period  in  question  and
    queried  by  the  Immigration  Officer  derived  from  three  different
    customers. There is a letter in the Appellant's bundle at page 68  from
    Unique Solutions Ltd, one of his clients, which  lists  three  invoices
    which that company paid between November 2012  and  January  2013.  The
    Appellant produced original bank statements for  the  same  period  and
    pointed out the corresponding entries in his bank account  representing
    payment of those invoices.  On that basis I am satisfied  that  he  was
    paid for work done for Unique Solutions Ltd.

16. I was then referred to the notes on the reverse  of  the  landing  card
    made by the Immigration Officer  which states:-

         "Pax claimed earnings of �22,071 working in marketing company self-
         employed - very vague regarding what he did to earn this money- Pax
         claims he did not know how much tax  he  paid  in  2011  for  self-
         employed business - claims his accountant paid tax for 2011  -  Pax
         currently on Tier 1 General and claims  earnings  of  18,000  self-
         employed for some media business "

17. It is of note that he claimed earnings of �22,071  which  is  precisely
    the figure recorded by his accountants as his self-employed income  for
    the period 2010 - 2011. It is not correct therefore to say that he  did
    not know this figure.

18. It is also recorded in the refusal that he did  not  know  his  pre-tax
    profits in the year 2012 - 2013. In his  evidence  the  Appellant  said
    that  he  was  only  asked  about  turnover.  An  examination  of   the
    Immigration Officer's record of interview at question  47  confirms  in
    fact that the Appellant is correct. He was not asked how much his  pre-
    tax profit was; he was asked how much money his company turned over  in
    2012 - 2013. He gave the answer of between �20,000 and �22,000 which is
    correct.

19. The situation in this case  seems  to  have  been  that  the  Appellant
    alighted from a long haul flight from Pakistan to  be  asked  extremely
    detailed questions about  business  figures  over  the  previous  three
    years. It is unsurprising  that  he  could  not  remember  the  precise
    details of all of this. It is not information  one  carries  around  in
    one's head nor would  he  have  the  paperwork  be  about  his  person.
    However, overall it is clear that the answers that he gave at interview
    accurately reflect what he said when he made his application as a  Tier
    1 General  Migrant  and  accurately  reflects  the  documents  that  he
    submitted also in connection with that application. On that basis it is
    cannot be said that the  Immigration Officer on behalf of the Secretary
    of State was justified in concluding  that  false  representations  had
    been made or material facts  not  disclosed  for  the  purpose  of  the
    application. It is  quite  clear  from  the  HMRC  documents  that  the
    Appellant  pays  tax  for  both  employed  earnings  and  self-employed
    earnings.

20. Having set aside the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    reheard the appeal I am entirely satisfied that the Secretary of  State
    has failed to establish the misrepresentation or  failure  to  disclose
    required for the decision under paragraph 321 (A) and  the  Appellant's
    appeal is allowed.

21. The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed.

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award as the decision of the Immigration Officer was not  justified  on  the
basis of the evidence before him.
