Representation:
For the Appellant:          Mr Toal of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms R Peterson, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant born on 30 July 1999, a national of China appealed to the
    First-tier Tribunal against the decision of the respondent dated 13 May
    2013 to refuse the appellant leave to enter the United Kingdom pursuant
    to pursuant to paragraph 297 of HC 395 (as amended) and  Article  8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights.

 2. A Judge of the First-tier Tribunal, Carroll dismissed  the  appellant's
    appeal pursuant to the Immigration Rules.  Permission to appeal was  at
    first refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett on 20  August  2014
    but Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins in a decision dated 12  December  2014
    granted the appellant permission to appeal. It was found to be arguable
    that the First-tier Tribunal Judge misdirected herself and applied  the
    wrong test. The permission Judge  stated  that  paragraphs  10  and  18
    trouble him because "whilst a recent change in the alleged arrangements
    for the care of the child might raise suspicions about the  credibility
    of  an  application,  the  Tribunal  is  still  concerned   about   the
    arrangements for the child that actually exist at the date of decision.
    Arguably, the First-tier Tribunal has applied the wrong test".

 3. Thus the appeal came before me.

Decision of the first-tier Tribunal

 4. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the  appellant's  appeal,  concluding
    that there is no evidence of any  form  of  communication  between  the
    appellant and her mother, whether by letter, greetings card or by email
    and that there are no photographs. The Judge stated the following which
    I summarise. The appellant's mother went to the United Kingdom in  2002
    and returned to China in 2012. During this time the appellant had  been
    living with her grandparents.

 5. Taking into account the case of  TD  (paragraph  297  (i)  (e):  ("full
    responsibility")  Yemen  [2006]  UK  AIT  00049,  the  issue  of   sole
    responsibility is a factual matter to be decided upon all the evidence.
    Because of abandonment of responsibility, issues may arise between  the
    remaining parent and others who  have  day-to-day  care  of  the  child
    abroad. The test is whether  the  parent  has  continuing  control  and
    direction of the child's upbringing, including making all the important
    decisions in the child's life. The appellant's  father  has  played  no
    part in the appellant's life for many  years.  The  evidence  submitted
    however falls far short of establishing that the appellant's mother has
    exercised full responsibility for the appellant's upbringing in  China.
    The only evidence relating to the appellant schooling is  contained  in
    the respondent's bundle, is a  certificate  which  certifies  that  the
    appellant is enrolled at school as at March 2013 and she was  in  class
    III grade 2. The power of attorney by the appellant's mother giving the
    appellant's grandfather day-to-day care for the appellant in China  has
    been considered. The witness statement of Mr Marcou in which he  states
    that the appellant's grandparents are now quite elderly and finding  it
    more and more difficult to care for the appellant. There are six  money
    transfers to the appellant for a total of �760 in 2012 and 11 transfers
    totalling �1310 in 2013 and three transfers  totalling  �400  in  2014.
    There is no evidence in  the  form  of  a  letter  from  the  appellant
    submitted with the visa application form. Much of the evidence  in  the
    appellant's  bundle  very  substantially  postdates  the   respondent's
    decision under appeal. Considering all the evidence together  there  is
    very little evidence to support the claim that the  appellant's  mother
    has had continuing control and direction of the appellant's upbringing,
    including making all the important decisions in life  since  2002.  The
    evidence points to recent contact  only.  The  appellant's  appeal  was
    dismissed.



Grounds of appeal

 6. The grounds of appeal state the following which  I  summarise.  In  the
    appellant's bundle of  documents  there  were  a  number  of  documents
    relating  to  the  appellant's  education.  (Pages  31  to  38).  These
    documents postdate the respondent's decision but  the  Judge  does  not
    make any findings with regard to the  admissibility  of  this  evidence
    when reaching her  conclusion  that  the  appellant  has  not  provided
    documents of the appellant's education.  The  Judge  erred  in  law  in
    failing to have due regard to material before her at  the  hearing.  In
    any event  the  evidence  provided  by  the  appellant  at  appeal  was
    admissible evidence as it showed  circumstances  at  the  time  of  the
    respondent's decision and did not show  new  circumstances.  The  Judge
    therefore erred in her conclusion that the appellant's sponsor has  not
    exercised full responsibility for the  appellant's  upbringing  because
    they were no documents relating to the education of the appellant.

 7. The appellant's bundle contained documents submitted to the  respondent
    prior to the date of decision including various birthday and  Christmas
    cards sent between the appellant and her mother.  The  judge  therefore
    erred in her conclusion that there  is  no  evidence  of  any  form  of
    communication, whether by  letter,  greeting  card  or  by  email.  The
    appellant's bundle also contained documents submitted to the respondent
    including further family photographs. The Judge clearly failed to  have
    regard  to  material  evidence  provided  by  the  appellant   to   the
    respondent, both prior to the date of  the  respondent's  decision  and
    after the respondent's decision. All these documents were admissible as
    they demonstrate circumstances at the date of decision.  The  appellant
    sponsor has always maintained that she has been responsible financially
    for the appellant including the  payment  of  her  school  fields.  The
    inconsistencies raised by the  Judge  in  respect  of  the  grandfather
    paying fees or whether it came from the appellant's  mother.  The  fact
    remains for the purposes of TD, the appellant's mother  exercised  full
    responsibility as she was responsible  for  payments  for  school  fees
    which he did by sending funds from UK to China.

 8. In respect of paragraph 17 of the determination the Judge  states  that
    there is an inconsistency with regard to the data provided as  to  when
    the appellant commenced school as the sponsor gave oral evidence to the
    effect that the appellant  started  in  2007  and  a  letter  from  the
    appellant at page 53 of the bundle states she  started  in  2008.  This
    inconsistency does not go to the core of the issue in  the  appeal.  As
    regard to the alleged inconsistency regarding access to the appellant's
    school's website and the lack of a computer at the appellant's mother's
    home address, there is no inconsistency with the  appellant's  mother's
    evidence. The appellant's mother does not require a computer at home to
    follow developments of the appellant's school  on  the  school  website
    which she does regularly.

 9. The appellant's mother recently made a  trip  to  China  to  visit  the
    appellant so that  they  could  spend  the  appellant's  15th  birthday
    together. The appellant supplied further documentary evidence which was
    not available previously including a declaration of Ping Zheng dated 20
    August  2014,  National  Certificate  dated  20  August  2014,  Chinese
    document certified by FSG law firm dated 8 August 2014,  passport  copy
    and boarding pass as evidence  of  the  appellant's  mother's  trip  to
    China.

10. The Judge did not properly consider the case of  TD  and  the  case  of
    Nmaju v SSHD [2001] INLR 26 as to the length of time which  the  parent
    concerned had sole responsibility. Paragraph 17  of  the  determination
    states that the evidence points to recent contact only.

11.  The Judge makes no findings whatsoever with regard  to  whether  there
    are indeed compelling family or other  considerations  which  make  the
    exclusion of the child undesirable and suitable arrangements have  been
    made for the child's care.

12. The Judge has failed to  fully  consider  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant and her young stepbrother who resides in the United  Kingdom.
    There is no assessment of the child's best interests under  section  55
    and therefore the determination is flawed and not  in  accordance  with
    the established principles  and  case  law.  In  the  case  of  R  (oao
    Tinizaray) v SSHD (2011) EWCH 1850 with states that section  55  should
    be considered even if the child is not present in the United Kingdom.

The hearing.

13. After hearing arguments by the parties at the  hearing  as  to  whether
    there is an error of law in the determination, I found that  the  Judge
    materially erred in law in applying the wrong test and not taking  into
    account all the evidence in the appeal.

14. The Judge found that the appellant's mother had sole responsibility for
    the appellant because there were no documents relating to the education
    of  the  appellant.  This  of  course  was  not  accurate  because  the
    appellant's bundle of documents before the  Judge  contained  documents
    relating to  the  appellant's  education  although  they  postdate  the
    decision of the respondent. The Judge also failed to take into  account
    that the appellant had provided documents prior to the date of decision
    of various birthday cards and Christmas cards of communication  between
    the appellant and her mother. The  appellant's  bundle  also  contained
    further documents given after the date  of  the  respondent's  decision
    which were not considered by the Judge and nor  was  there  any  reason
    given for why they were not considered.

15. Having  considered  the  determination  as  a  whole,  I  find  Judge's
    consideration of the appellant's appeal in respect of  the  Immigration
    Rules has not been properly made and is materially flawed. I set  aside
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal in this entirety and remake the
    decision. I heard submissions from both parties which are set out in my
    Record of Proceedings.

Remaking the decision

16. I have  considered  all  the  evidence  in  the  appeal  including  the
    appellant's bundle of documents consisting of 264 pages. The  essential
    facts are not in dispute in this appeal. The  appellant's  mother  left
    the appellant in the care of his grandfather and she came to the United
    Kingdom. The appellant's mother is now a British citizen and also has a
    child from her current relationship in this country.

17. Paragraph 297 of the Rules is in these terms:


         "297.    The requirements to be met by a person seeking  indefinite
             leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child  of  a  parent,
             parents or a relative present and settled  or  being  admitted
             for settlement in the United Kingdom are that he:

             (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join  a  parent,
                  parents  or  a  relative   in   one   of   the   following
                  circumstances:

                  (a)  both parents are present and settled  in  the  United
                      Kingdom; or

                  (b)  both parents are being admitted on the same  occasion
                      for settlement; or

                  (c)  one parent is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                      Kingdom and the other is being admitted on  the  same
                      occasion for settlement; or

                  (d)  one parent is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                      Kingdom or being admitted on the  same  occasion  for
                      settlement and the other parent is dead; or

                  (e)  one parent is  present  and  settled  in  the  United
                      Kingdom or being admitted on the  same  occasion  for
                      settlement and has had sole  responsibility  for  the
                      child's upbringing; or

                  (f)  one parent or a relative is present  and  settled  in
                      the United Kingdom or  being  admitted  on  the  same
                      occasion for settlement and  there  are  serious  and
                      compelling family or other considerations which  make
                      exclusion  of  the  child  undesirable  and  suitable
                      arrangements have been made  for  the  child's  care;
                      and

             (ii)      is under the age of 18; and

             (iii)     is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and
                  is not a civil partner, and has not formed an  independent
                  family unit; and

             (iv)      can, and will, be  accommodated  adequately  by  the
                  parent, parents or relative the child is seeking  to  join
                  without recourse to public funds  in  accommodation  which
                  the parent, parents or relative the child  is  seeking  to
                  join, own or occupy exclusively; and

             (v) can, and will, be maintained  adequately  by  the  parent,
                  parents, or relative the child is seeking to join, without
                  recourse to public funds; and

             (vi)      holds a valid United  Kingdom  entry  clearance  for
                  entry in this capacity."



18. There is no dispute between the parties that the appellant is the minor
    children of her mother who is present and settled in the United Kingdom
    for the purposes of  paragraph  297  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    respondent has also not taken issue with the claim that  the  appellant
    can be maintained and accommodated in the United Kingdom by her  mother
    without recourse to public funds.  There is also no  dispute  that  the
    appellant's father has not had any role in the appellant's life.

19. The first  issue  is  whether  the  appellants'  mother  has  had  sole
    responsibility for the appellants' (paragraph 297 (i)(e)).  The  second
    issue is whether there is any serious and compelling  family  or  other
    consideration  making  the  exclusion  of  the  appellant   undesirable
    (paragraph 297(f)(i)).

20. I find that the appellant and her mother have maintained  contact  with
    each other and there is evidence in the form of letters greeting  cards
    and photographs. There is also evidence that the appellant's mother has
    been paying her school fees. There is evidence of financial remittances
    from her to the appellant grandfather or to the appellant in person  in
    China. There is  evidence  that  the  appellant's  mother  visited  the
    appellant in China so they could spend her 15th birthday together.

21. Although some documents show recent contact, I take  into  account  the
    case of TD and Nmaju referred to me by the  appellant  which  makes  it
    clear that there is no requirement under paragraph 297 (i)  (e)  as  to
    the  length  of  time  for  which  the  parent   concerned   had   sole
    responsibility. I find that the appellant has  had  containing  control
    and direction of the appellant's upbringing, including making  all  the
    important decisions in her life.

22. I find that it is established on a balance of  probabilities  that  the
    appellant's mother has had sole responsibility for the  appellant  even
    though the grandfather was looking after the appellant on a  day-to-day
    basis.

23. I next consider whether the appellant falls  within  the  circumstances
    referred to in paragraph 297(i)(f)  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  which
    would be applicable if 'there are  serious  and  compelling  family  or
    other considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable  and
    suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care.

24. I  also  find  that  the  appellant  has  provided  evidence  that  the
    appellant's  grandfather  is  suffering  from  some   serious   medical
    conditions. I  have  also  taken  into  account  the  letter  from  the
    appellant grandfather which states he is in  poor  health  and  can  no
    longer after the appellant. The appellant has written a letter  stating
    that she feels very sad and is eager to be together with her mother.  I
    find that the appellant's grandfather can not look after the  appellant
    in China due to his age and bad health and there is no reason for me to
    doubt this evidence.

25. I find that the appellant's mother came to this country  for  a  better
    life but has never abandoned her child in China. I find  that  she  has
    always maintained emotional ties with her daughter  in  China  and  has
    also financed her from the money earned in this country.

26. I therefore find that the appellant satisfies the Immigration Rules  in
    the category that she seeks to enter the United Kingdom.

27. For the reasons  given  above,  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is set aside as it is infected by material error. I remake the
    decision and allow the appellant's appeal.
