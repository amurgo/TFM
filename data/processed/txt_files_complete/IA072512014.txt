                     NOTICE TREATING APPEAL AS ABANDONED

    1. The Appellant, a national of Pakistan  born  on  05  July  1984,  was
       granted permission to appeal the decision of Judge of the  First-tier
       Tribunal Hussein who dismissed her appeal  against  the  Respondent's
       decision refusing to grant her leave to remain on the  basis  of  her
       relationship with Mr D. Gray.

    2. The 'error of law' hearing was set down for 17 November 2015. On that
       day I was informed by  Mr  Wilding  that  the  Appellant  voluntarily
       departed the United Kingdom  on  27  August  2015.  He  produced,  in
       support, a screenshot  from  the  CID  (Cases  Information  Database)
       confirming the same. There was no appearance by the Appellant, or  by
       any representative.

    3. Section 104(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002,
       indicates, for the purposes of this  appeal,  that  an  appeal  under
       section 82(1) of the same Act (the  Appellant's  appeal  was  brought
       under section 82(1)) by a person while they are in the United Kingdom
       shall be treated as abandoned if  the  Appellant  leaves  the  United
       Kingdom.

    4. I am satisfied the Appellant has left the United  Kingdom.  In  these
       circumstances, and pursuant to rule 17A  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, I am issuing this notice  informing  the
       parties that the appeal is being treated as abandoned.

No anonymity direction is made.
