Representation:

For the Appellant:          Mr R Pennington-Benton, Counsel instructed by
                    Synthesis   Chambers
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

      1. The appellant is a Pakistani national born in Saudi  Arabia  on  30
         October  1981.  He  challenges  the  determination  of   First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Bartlett promulgated on 17 March 2017 dismissing his
         appeal against the respondent's decision of  24  November  2015  to
         refuse his application for a leave on long residence and article  8
         grounds.


      2. The judge found that the appellant could not meet the  requirements
         of paragraph 276B(v) as he had been in the  UK  in  breach  of  the
         immigration laws by spending some 6 ï¿½  years  here  without  lawful
         leave. It was conceded on his behalf that he  could  not  meet  the
         requirements of Appendix FM with regard to family life as he had no
         partner and his son was not a British national and did  not  reside
         in the UK. The judge then considered  paragraph  275ADE(1)(vi)  and
         concluded that the appellant's  specific  circumstances  were  such
         that there were very significant obstacles  to  his  reintegration.
         Instead of allowing the appeal, however, the judge then went on  to
         consider the article 8 claim outside the rules  and  dismissed  the
         appeal.

      3. Permission was granted by Judge Davies on 10 October  2017  on  the
         basis that the judge had arguably erred in  dismissing  the  appeal
         after having found that the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)
         had been met.

      4. The respondent, in  her  Rule  24  response,  did  not  oppose  the
         application for permission and invited the  Tribunal  to  determine
         the article 8 claim at a hearing. The matter then came before me.



    The Hearing



      5. The appellant attended the hearing but did not  give  evidence.  On
         his  behalf,  Mr  Pennington-Benton  submitted   that   given   the
         respondent's concession on the error of law issue, the only  matter
         was disposal. He submitted that the judge had made  sound  findings
         of fact and no issue was taken with those. The error  applied  only
         to the manner in which the law had been applied;  specifically,  on
         how the facts were assessed outside the rules.  He  submitted  that
         the finding on paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) should be  upheld  and  that
         the appeal should be allowed.

      6. In response, Mr Tarlow confirmed that the respondent did  not  seek
         to go behind the judge's findings of facts and invited  me  to  re-
         make the decision in the light of those findings.

      7. At the conclusion of the hearing I reserved my decision which I now
         give.



    Conclusions


      8. The respondent has properly conceded that Judge  Bartlett  made  an
         error of law in reaching contradictory conclusions  on  article  8.
         The judge appears to be under the misapprehension that  the  appeal
         could  not  be  allowed  under  the  rules  even  though  paragraph
         276ADE(1)(vi) had been satisfied. That is an error of law  and  the
         decision to dismiss the appeal is set aside.

      9. I was invited to re-make the decision based on the judge's findings
         of  fact  pertaining  to  276ADE(1)(vi).  These  are  contained  at
         paragraphs 20-28.



     10. The judge found that the appellant spent the first 17 years of  his
         life in Saudi Arabia where he was born  to  Pakistani  parents  and
         that he then came to the UK in 1999. He had spent half of his  life
         in each of those two countries. He attended a Pakistani  school  in
         Saudi Arabia until he left aged 17 and he  could  speak,  read  and
         write  Urdu.  He  was  brought  up  with  Pakistani   customs   and
         traditions. His father had  returned  to  Pakistan  but  they  were
         estranged. The appellant  had  two  brothers  in  Saudi  Arabia,  a
         brother in the UK and a sister in Pakistan.  His  mother  lives  in
         Saudi Arabia but does not have a permanent visa. She makes  regular
         visits to Pakistan where she has a sister. The appellant  had  also
         visited Pakistan for holidays. He was a professional  poker  player
         and would be unable  to  continue  this  in  Pakistan.  He  had  IT
         qualifications and would be able to  find  employment  in  Pakistan
         where his family members, excluding his father, would  assist  him.
         The appellant had a son  who  lived  in  Austria  with  his  former
         partner. They visited the UK regularly  to  enable  contact  to  be
         maintained. The appellant was not particularly  religious  and  was
         not a practising Muslim. The judge found that the case  was  finely
         balanced but there was enough to find in the appellant's favour.



     11. Whilst I take the view that the findings are generously  made,  the
         respondent has not sought to challenge them and they are  therefore
         preserved. It follows that since the appellant has  been  found  to
         meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi), his  appeal  must
         be allowed.



    Decision


     12. The First-tier Tribunal made errors of law such that  the  decision
         is set aside. I re-make the decision and allow the appeal under the
         immigration rules.



    Anonymity



     13. No request for an anonymity order was made and I see no  reason  to
         make one.
