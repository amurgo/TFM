                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Mehnaz Akhtar, the sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Entry Clearance Officer,   Islamabad appeals against a decision  of
    Judge  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Herbert  who,   in   a   determination
    promulgated on 20 March 2017, allowed the appeal of  Mr  Mehnaz  Akhtar
    against a decision of the Entry Clearance Officer to refuse him a  visa
    to enable him to enter Britain to live with his spouse.

2.   Although the Entry Clearance Officer is the appellant before me I  will
    for ease of reference refer to him as the  respondent  as  he  was  the
    respondent in the First-tier.  Similarly I will  refer  to  Mr  Shahbaz
    Hussain as the appellant.

3.    The appellant was born in October 1994.  In 2009 he married his  first
    wife in Norway living with her there until in July  2012.  He   applied
    for separation from his first wife.  The  decree  was  granted  by  the
    Norwegian authorities on 10 August 2012.   On  13  September  2012  the
    appellant received a custodial sentence of 40 days after  he  had  been
    convicted of domestic violence against  his  estranged  wife.   He  was
    deported from Norway on 22 June 2013, being  excluded from the Schengen
    area for a period of five years.  He was divorced in August that  year.
    In November 2013 he was introduced to the sponsor whom he married on 11
    April 2014 and thereafter he made the application to enter Britain on a
    spouse visa.  His application was refused as it was considered that his
    exclusion from Britain was conducive to the public good and furthermore
    that the financial requirements of the Rules were not met despite there
    being evidence that the sponsor had in her account the sum of ï¿½65,000.

2.   The appellant's appeal was heard by Judge Herbert on 7 March 2017.   In
    his determination he stated that he  accepted  that  the  marriage  was
    genuine and that he was satisfied that by July 2015 and the date of the
    Entry Clearance Manager's decision there were sufficient funds  showing
    that the appellant had  satisfied  the  minimum  requirements  both  in
    relation to the sponsor's income and in relation to  her  savings.   He
    stated that "it is clearly established solely in relation  to  the  P60
    for the year ending 5 April  2016  in  any  event  and  the  supporting
    documentation".

3.   In paragraph 30 he wrote:-

         "30. Finally turning to the  matter  of  the  appellant's  previous
             conviction, I am satisfied that this was a  sentence  of  less
             than twelve months' imprisonment being some 40 days and having
             regard to the Immigration Rules, I am satisfied that given the
             limited scope of the conviction, the current reaction  of  the
             victim supporting the appellant's  application  and  the  fact
             that they  have  an  ongoing  positive  relationship  for  the
             purposes of the best interests of their child, that  there  is
             overwhelming evidence that the appellant is able to  meet  the
             criteria under paragraph S-EC- .1.4.(c) of Appendix FM as I am
             not satisfied  this  exclusion  from  the  United  Kingdom  is
             conducive to the public good."

4.   He then went on to state that he was satisfied that the  appellant  has
    not committed any further offences since that committed in Norway  and,
    having referred to the test in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27 he stated that the
    appellant had established a significant private and  family  life  with
    his wife and that grave consequences would flow from the  decision  and
    that private and family life would be significantly undermined  if  the
    entry clearance refusal were to be maintained.

5.   He stated that the appellant's presence  in  the  United  Kingdom  will
    facilitate his future contact with his son in Norway which is  in  that
    child's best interest and is in accordance  with  the  duties  for  the
    respondent under Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration
    Act 2009.

6.   He stated that he considered that the appellant's  reconciliation  with
    his ex-wife was perfectly genuine and  stated  that  "there  is  not  a
    propensity to be violent to women generally and therefore this  offence
    whilst serious falls at  the  lower  end  of  such  cases  of  domestic
    violence".

7.   He has stated that he  found  a  discretion  in  any  event  under  the
    Immigration Rules in paragraph S-EC.1.4 and that that discretion  ought
    to be exercised in favour of the appellant "as his exclusion  would  be
    disproportionate to the criminal offence for which he was convicted and
    his exclusion from the Schengen area to which the United Kingdom is not
    party in any event".

8.   The judge therefore allowed the appeal on both  immigration  and  human
    rights grounds.

9.   The grounds of appeal,  on  which  Mr  Avery  relied  stated  that  the
    appellant had been convicted  of  a  domestic  violence  offence  which
    resulted in a 40 day custodial sentence and therefore clearly fell  for
    refusal under S-EC.1.4(c) of Appendix FM.  It was not, it  was  argued,
    open to the judge to find that the exclusion from the United Kingdom of
    the appellant was conducive to the public good.

10.  With respect to his findings on the sponsor's  financial  situation  it
    was argued that  it was  unclear how he reached the conclusion that the
    appellant met the requirement of the Rules as the evidence on which the
    judge appeared to rely did not relate the situation pertaining  at,  or
    in the relevant period before, the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer.

11.  The grounds stated that whether or not that the  issue  of  whether  or
    not the appellant was genuine  with  regard  to  the  relationship  was
    strongly questioned by his being motivated by a desire to relocate from
    Pakistan.

12.  It was stated that the judge's findings on Article  8  were  undermined
    by his errors with respect to the Rules  but  were  otherwise  entirely
    inadequate.  It was not only inappropriate to consider that  his  entry
    to the UK would facilitate closer ties to the son in Norway given  that
    the Norwegian authorities removed him but also factually inaccurate  as
    it appears that he is still subject to a Schengen visa ban.

13.  Mr Avery having relied on those grounds.

14.  At the beginning of the hearing I read to the sponsor, who speaks  good
    English, the terms of Section S-EC.1.4. of Appendix FM.   It  reads  as
    follows:-

         "S-EC-.1.4.


         The exclusion of the applicant from the United Kingdom is conducive
         to the public good because they have:


         ...


         (c)  been  convicted  of  an  offence  for  which  they  have  been
             sentenced to a period of  imprisonment  of  less  than  twelve
             months, unless a period of five years has passed since the end
             of the sentence.


         Where this paragraph applies, unless refusal would be  contrary  to
         the Human Rights Convention or the Convention Protocol relating  to
         the  Status  of  Refugees,  it  will   only   be   in   exceptional
         circumstances that the public interest in maintaining refusal  will
         be outweighed by compelling factors."

15.  The sponsor stated that the appellant was a changed man and  that  they
    had a close family life and that she had borne their child.   She  said
    that she could not live in Pakistan as,  in effect,  she had lived  all
    her life here.

Discussion

16.  I consider that there are material errors of law in  the  determination
    of the Immigration Judge.  He has clearly misunderstood  the  terms  of
    Section S-EC.1.4. which makes it mandatory  to  refuse  an  application
    where an offence has been committed and  five  years  had  not  passed.
    While it is correct that the Rule refers to a decision  being  contrary
    to the Human Rights Convention it does state that it would only  be  in
    exceptional circumstances that the public  interest  in  maintaining  a
    refusal would be outweighed by compelling factors.  There  are  clearly
    no such compelling factors here.   Nothing  has  been  put  forward  to
    indicate that  the  sponsor  could  not  live  with  the  appellant  in
    Pakistan.  She commented that she would be unable to work there and  it
    appears from the application form that the appellant  is  not  working.
    There is  no reason is given as to why he is not working  in  Pakistan.
    The  appellant clearly therefore does not qualify for entry  under  the
    immigration rules.

  17. This was a marriage entered in to at a time  when  the  appellant  had
    been deported from Norway and there was no indication that he would  be
    granted entry into Britain.  The  reality  is  that  there  is  nothing
    exceptional or compelling in this case.  Indeed the reality is that the
    judge has not made that finding. Moreover,   he makes no mention of the
    appellant's child here and merely refers to his first child but what he
    states with regard to that child's interests clearly did not take  into
    account the fact that the appellant would not  be  able  to  travel  to
    Norway as he is excluded from the Schengen area  and  indeed  has  been
    deported from that country.  It is clearly the  case   that  the  judge
    erred in law in invoking  Section 55 of the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 with regard to the child  of  a  Norwegian  and  a
    Pakistani neither of whom live in Britain when  the child does not live
    here.  I consider that the  decision  of  the  judge  on  human  rights
    grounds disclosed a clear error of law  and  for  the  reasons  I  have
    given that he had also erred in  allowing  the  appeal  on  immigration
    Rules.  I therefore set aside  the  determination  of  the  Immigration
    Judge in its entirety.

18.  I have considered whether or not it would be appropriate to remit  this
    appeal for a further decision on human rights  grounds.   The  reality,
    however, is that before the judge and the Entry Clearance Officer there
    was insufficient evidence to show that the  financial  requirements  of
    the Rules were met and given the terms of Section SC.1.4. and the  fact
    that five years had not past when the decision was made and there is no
    further evidence been put forward before me as to  any  exceptional  or
    compelling circumstances that  could  prevent  the  sponsor  living  in
    Pakistan with her husband,  there would be no point in doing  so.   For
    the above reasons I remake the decision and  dismiss  this  appeal  not
    only because the exclusion of the appellant from the United Kingdom  is
    conducive to the  public  good  under  the  provisions  of  Section  S-
    EC.1.4(c) but also because the financial requirements of the Rules have
    not been met - the appellant would have had to have had  the  money  in
    her account for the requisite period before the application and  indeed
    would have to show how she came by that substantial sum.  I  would  add
    that there is no indication that the appellant could meet  the  English
    language requirements of the Rules.   As  I  have  said  there  are  no
    exceptional compelling factors in this case and  for  these  reasons  I
    dismiss this appeal on both immigration and human rights grounds.

Notice of Decision
