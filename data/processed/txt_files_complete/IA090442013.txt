                           DETERMINATION & REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge  Jeffrey  Cameron),  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  25
    November 2013, to  a wife's appeal by a citizen of Bangladesh, born  12
    August 1994. The appellant arrived in this country on 25 March 2012  on
    a visit visa, valid till 6 September; but on 12 August went through  an
    Islamic marriage ceremony with the sponsor, who was by then  a  British
    citizen, and on  3  September  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  his
    "unmarried partner". This was refused, with notice served  on  8  March
    2013; but on 23 May last year the appellant gave birth to a son by  the
    sponsor, whom we shall call F.



 2. Permission was given on the basis that

     a) the sponsor's difficulties in  maintaining  contact  with  his  two
        children by a former marriage, if he, the  appellant  and  F  could
        only live together in Bangladesh, did not amount  to  'exceptional'
        or 'compelling' circumstances (see Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)
        Pakistan [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC) and authorities discussed there); and

     b) F's best interests should not have been treated  as  effectively  a
        'trump card' for the appellant.

    There has been no suggestion at any stage that the parties  could  meet
    the funding requirements of the Immigration Rules:  though  Mr  Wilding
    sought to raise another point of challenge to the judge's decision,  on
    the extent to which they fell short of  them,  we  have  not  found  it
    necessary to consider this.

 3. There had been a previous appeal against the Home Office decision of  8
    March, which was allowed by another first-tier judge; but on 15 October
    the Upper Tribunal (McCloskey J, President, and Judge  Warr)  set  that
    decision aside, and we need not return to it. We dealt on 26 March with
    the Home Office's appeal on the law, and on 4 April our ruling on that,
    substantially reproduced in the  present  decision,  went  out  to  the
    parties; on 15 July we heard oral evidence on the point set out  at  12
    below. On each occasion, the appellant told us  she  would  prefer  the
    sponsor to speak for her, which he did through a  Bengali  interpreter:
    we made sure he understood everything Mr Wilding and Mr Melvin said (in
    simple terms, as we asked them), including the gist of any  authorities
    referred to, and had a full opportunity to reply to it. We shall  start
    by considering the 'best interests' point, since that must always be  a
    primary consideration.

 4. F is of course a British  citizen,  through  his  father:  on  this  we
    remember the well-known passage in ZH (Tanzania)  [2011]  UKSC  4  (per
    Lord Hope at paragraph 41)

       The fact of British citizenship does not trump everything  else.  But
       it will hardly ever be less  than  a  very  significant  and  weighty
       factor against moving  children  who  have  that  status  to  another
       country with a parent who has no right to remain here, especially  if
       the effect of doing this is that  they  will  inevitably  lose  those
       benefits and advantages for the rest of their childhood.

 5. Mr Wilding reminded us of MK (best interests  of  child)  India  [2011]
    UKUT 475 (IAC), and we have in mind  the  principles  set  out  in  the
    judicial head-note, which there is no need to repeat here, beyond  that
    the 'best interests' consideration forms "a distinct inquiry", separate
    from the public interest concerns which must be weighed against them.

 6. Turning to the judge's decision, Mr Wilding began by  referring  us  to
    his  consideration  of  F's  best  interests  in  staying   here,   and
    particularly being with his parents  wherever  they  are,  and  of  the
    sponsor's difficulties in keeping in touch with his other children,  if
    he, the appellant and F all had to go to Bangladesh. While  Mr  Wilding
    challenged what the judge said on the last point at paragraphs 60 -  61
    as speculative, we took the view that this was a  point  on  which  the
    judge was entitled to find as he did for the  future,  having  accepted
    the history given by the sponsor.



 7. There was nothing else in the judge's treatment of  that  side  of  the
    equation to which Mr Wilding took exception, except for his finding  on
    the difficulties the sponsor  would  have  in  satisfying  the  funding
    requirements of the Rules on any future entry clearance application  by
    the appellant. There  is  well-established  authority  that  neither  a
    prospective good case for entry clearance nor a bad one is to be  taken
    into account in deciding in principle whether that route  ought  to  be
    taken.

 8. The real difficulty with the judge's decision on the basis he gave  it,
    though, came with the way he balanced the public interest  against  F's
    and his parents'. He dealt with this at paragraphs 64 - 67.  At  64  he
    analysed the situation in terms of the appellant and the sponsor's both
    having  known  when  they  got  together  that  her  status  here   was
    precarious,  and  would  have   found   the   decision   under   appeal
    proportionate to the legitimate purpose of ,  if  that  had  been  all.
    However at 65 he noted the birth of F, and said this:

       Although he could go with his mother this would deprive  him  of  the
       benefits of growing up in this country and would also remove him from
       his father. His removal would also have the consequence of  depriving
       him of the genuine enjoyment of ... his status as an EU citizen.

 9. At 66 - 67 the judge concluded that, given he had  found  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the sponsor to go back to  Bangladesh  with  his
    new family, and F's  consequent  best  interests  in  having  both  his
    parents with him here, the balance  of  proportionality  came  down  in
    favour of the appellant's being allowed to stay. Naturally the  sponsor
    supported the judge's decision, though at the same time  he  relied  on
    points where the judge had  not  found  in  his  favour,  such  as  his
    contention that he and his family would be without means of support  in
    Bangladesh.

10. In our view, the judge's proportionality finding was one he would  have
    been entitled to make, on the considerations he  mentions,  if  he  had
    first considered whether there were such 'exceptional' or  'compelling'
    features in the case (see MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192,  Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach)  Pakistan  [2013]  UKUT  640
    (IAC), and Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate  aim)  Pakistan  [2014]  UKUT  85
    (IAC)) as to require any  free-standing  consideration  of  article  8.
    However, a lawful decision required consideration of that  point,  and,
    if there were such features, it seemed to us  they  must  turn  on  the
    position of F.

11. Nevertheless, we could not deal with the question of F as  if  a  stork
    had suddenly brought him down to his parents on 23 May 2013: elementary
    knowledge of human biology suggests that he must  have  been  conceived
    around the end of August 2012. We were conscious that we had not  heard
    evidence from the sponsor or the  appellant  as  to  their  motives  in
    taking their family life  forward  so  rapidly,  on  any  view  of  the
    history.

12. Unless explained, the plain facts raise an obvious case with which  the
    parties, and the judge had needed to deal: was their  going  through  a
    marriage ceremony and conceiving a son within a month of the expiry  of
    the  appellant's  visit  visa  an  attempt  to  present  Her  Majesty's
    Government  with  a  fait  accompli,  which  would  make  her   removal
    practically impossible? While the marriage ceremony had no legal effect
    in this country, and the appellant might well have been unable, in  her
    situation, to contract one which did, no doubt it was a prerequisite in
    their custom to living and having a  child  together;  and  as  it  has
    turned out so far, it was the birth of that  child  which  led  to  the
    appellant's appeal being allowed.

13. Mr Wilding referred us to, without being able to cite it,  what  turned
    out to be Hayat (Pakistan) [2012] EWCA Civ 1054,  where  the  Court  of
    Appeal summarized the principles to be applied as follows:

       a) Where an applicant  who  does  not  have  lawful  entry  clearance
       pursues an  Article  8  claim,  a  dismissal  of  the  claim  on  the
       procedural ground that the policy requires that the applicant  should
       have  made  the  application  from  his  home  state  may  (but   not
       necessarily will) constitute a disruption of family or  private  life
       sufficient to engage  Article  8,  particularly  where  children  are
       adversely affected.
       b) Where  Article  8  is  engaged,  it  will  be  a  disproportionate
       interference with family or private life to  enforce  such  a  policy
       unless, to use the language of  Sullivan  LJ,  there  is  a  sensible
       reason for doing so.
       c) Whether it is sensible to enforce that policy will necessarily  be
       fact sensitive; Lord Brown identified  certain  potentially  relevant
       factors in Chikwamba. They will include the  prospective  length  and
       degree of disruption of family life and whether other members of  the
       family are settled in the UK.
       d) Where Article 8 is engaged and there is  no  sensible  reason  for
       enforcing the policy, the decision maker should determine the Article
       8 claim on its substantive merits,  having  regard  to  all  material
       factors, notwithstanding that  the  applicant  has  no  lawful  entry
       clearance.
       e) It will be a very rare case where it is appropriate for the  Court
       of   Appeal,   having   concluded   that   a   lower   tribunal   has
       disproportionately interfered with Article 8 rights in enforcing  the
       policy, to make  the  substantive  Article  8  decision  for  itself.
       Chikwamba was such an exceptional case.  Logically  the  court  would
       have to be satisfied that there is only  one  proper  answer  to  the
       Article 8 question  before  substituting  its  own  finding  on  this
       factual question.
       f) Nothing in Chikwamba was intended to  alter  the  way  the  courts
       should approach substantive Article 8 issues as  laid  down  in  such
       well known cases as Razgar and Huang.
       g) Although the cases do not say this in terms, in my judgment if the
       Secretary  of  State  has  no  sensible  reason  for  requiring   the
       application to be made from the home state,  the  fact  that  he  has
       failed to do so  should  not  thereafter  carry  any  weight  in  the
       substantive Article 8 balancing exercise.

    Whether there  is  a  'sensible  reason'  or  not  for  requiring  this
    appellant to go back to Bangladesh, no doubt  taking  F  with  her,  to
    apply for entry clearance from there, was in our view likely to  depend
    on the answer to the question we have posed at 12.

14. That was not however an answer that  could  be  given  on  the  judge's
    findings, and this is why we took the view that his decision must be re-
    made. That was to take place following a fresh hearing before  the  two
    of us on 8 May, for which directions were given on  a  separate  sheet.
    The appellant and the sponsor were encouraged to seek legal advice from
    a solicitor, a law centre or an immigration adviser  regulated  by  the
    Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner, but chose  not  to  do
    so. As it turned out, the hearing of 8 May had to be  adjourned  to  15
    July, on the basis of difficulties which the appellant said she had had
    on the previous occasion.

15. In our ruling of 4 April, we said a  little  about  the  form  of  that
    hearing.  Clearly  oral  evidence  about  the  circumstances  of  their
    marriage from both the appellant and the sponsor would be  crucial.  We
    made it clear, that, in the event that he had not only  got  the  taxi-
    driving opening he told us about, and were able to produce  either  tax
    and National Insurance paid wages slips, or  audited  accounts  (if  he
    were in business for himself) which showed he  could  comply  with  the
    funding requirements of the Rules, then, subject to any argument to the
    contrary from the Home Office, we might be  prepared  to  re-open  that
    side of the case; but not otherwise. On 15 July, the sponsor produced a
    letter from a car hire firm, showing he worked for them at a 'rent' (in
    fact a form of advance commission, as he said he used his own  car)  of
    �100 a week; but with none of the  evidence  of  income  which  we  had
    required.

16. While we do not see anything legally wrong with the judge's findings on
    the sponsor's difficulties in seeing his first family, on the  evidence
    with which he was presented, we were conscious not only that their best
    interests too would have to be considered, but that no  decision  about
    children is ever completely  final.  We  required  evidence  from  some
    independent source, giving the children's names and ages,  and  dealing
    with their present welfare, as well as the  history  of  the  sponsor's
    contact with them. This need not have been long, and  should  not  have
    been hard for him to get, in view of his own evidence that contact  was
    achieved  through  a  contact  centre,  presumably  run  by  the  local
    authority: a short letter from any responsible  person  there  was  all
    that was needed. However  in  a  letter  dated  11  June,  the  sponsor
    declined to produce any such evidence, and on 15 July he confirmed that
    this remained his position.

EVIDENCE

17. We shall now go on to the evidence given on 15 July. Both the appellant
    and the sponsor  gave  evidence  in  Bengali,  with  no  interpretation
    problems: each of them preferred  to  be  taken  through  the  relevant
    history by us, which we did in as neutral  a  manner  as  possible,  of
    course with a full opportunity for them to add  anything  they  wanted.
    The appellant complained at the start of her evidence of a stiff  neck;
    but we could not see that she had any difficulties in  giving  it,  for
    that reason or any other. She had arrived in this country on  25  March
    2012 with her mother: although she had finished her education two years
    before, she said she had no plans to do anything but visit her  brother
    over here, and then go home.

18. The appellant, then not yet 18, and her mother went to  stay  with  her
    brother: about the end of April her brother had a small  party  at  his
    house, just for some of his friends. The sponsor, by then 39,  who  had
    parted from his wife in 2009, dated this party in June or July: he said
    he had been asked along by a friend of his, who  knew  the  appellant's
    brother; but his friend had said nothing about who else would be there,
    and he had no idea they had any visitors from Bangladesh, or any  girls
    in the house. The appellant said she had equally little idea  that  the
    sponsor would be there.



19. Both the appellant and the sponsor said it  was  quite  usual  to  have
    mixed parties in Bangladeshi society in this country, and there was  no
    inhibition against speaking to someone of the other sex, without  first
    having been introduced. This was what happened in their case: each said
    they were the first to greet  the  other,  and  they  started  talking.
    According to the appellant, they exchanged mobile  phone  numbers,  and
    the sponsor rang her the next day.

20. The sponsor's account of their next contact was rather different:  just
    over a fortnight after the party, he was in a  local  shopping  centre,
    and saw the appellant out with her mother. They spoke  to  each  other,
    and the sponsor also spoke to her mother. It was only on this  occasion
    that he asked the appellant for her mobile number, and he spoke to  her
    afterwards.

21. Both said their liking for each other went on from  their  first  phone
    conversation, to the point where (six  weeks  later  according  to  the
    sponsor, and after about two weeks by  the  appellant's  account)  they
    decided to get married. The appellant said she knew her family wouldn't
    approve, as the sponsor was so  much  older  than  her,  and  had  been
    married before; so they decided to get married without telling  anyone.
    The appellant was  well  aware  that  her  visa  would  run  out  on  6
    September, and was afraid that, if she went back  with  her  mother  to
    Bangladesh, her family would have married her off to someone else.

22. The sponsor also mentioned the  appellant's  family's  disapproval:  he
    said he had asked the friend who brought him to the party to sound  her
    brother out about a marriage; but her brother would not agree,  and  so
    the plan for a secret marriage was arranged.  This  took  place  on  12
    August, at a  house  some  way  from  the  appellant's  brother's.  The
    appellant said she didn't know where the house  was:  the  sponsor  had
    taken her there. The sponsor however said it was  about  two  or  three
    miles from her brother's: he didn't know  how  the  appellant  had  got
    there, but thought an aunt (not mentioned by the appellant) had brought
    her to the ceremony, probably in a Bangladeshi cab.

23. The sponsor said he had arranged  the  qadi  who  was  to  perform  the
    ceremony: they didn't know each other, but  the  qadi  was  content  to
    marry them without any of  the  appellant's  relations  being  present:
    there was no-one to represent  her,  in  accordance  with  custom.  The
    appellant said she had been represented, by a friend of the  sponsor's:
    she said that after the ceremony, she went back  to  her  brother's  to
    begin with. The sponsor however said they had gone to her aunt's.

24. Both the appellant and the sponsor agreed that they had started  living
    together, and having sexual relations, at the sponsor's  flat  about  a
    fortnight after the ceremony. That would have been about 26 August On 3
    September, the appellant made her application for leave to remain: just
    in time before her visit visa ran out  on  the  6th.  That  application
    however has them not only living together already,  but  the  appellant
    saying, in answer to Q. 6.31 "I support my  partner  by  way  of  house
    keeping, cooking, cleaning and make sure he goes to work on time".



25. Both the appellant and the sponsor stoutly maintained  that  there  had
    been no pre-arranged plan for them to marry: they simply fell in  love,
    went through the Islamic ceremony (since neither  then  nor  later  had
    they been able to arrange a registered civil wedding,  without  showing
    the appellant's passport, with some evidence of her status  here),  and
    then nature had taken its course. As the sponsor put it, the conception
    of F was the will of Allah.

26. The sponsor said he had been settled in this country (of  which  he  is
    now a citizen) for many years: it follows that  F  is  also  a  British
    citizen, and he objected to the disruption of their life here  together
    with the appellant which would be caused by her returning to apply  for
    entry clearance in the ordinary way. Besides, he said she was  at  odds
    with all her family, in Bangladesh or here; and he had  been  here  too
    long to have anyone to turn to over there.

27. The sponsor said he saw his children by his wife at his  local  mosque,
    to  which  she  and  they  also  went.  He  produced  copies  of  birth
    certificates for them both: a boy A, born 23 November 2000; and a girl,
    N, born 8 August 2002. There was however no other documentary  evidence
    about these children, except for a summary of the sponsor's maintenance
    payments for them, with which he was slightly in arrears as of  20  May
    2014. The appellant has not met the children, and  knew  nothing  about
    them, except that the sponsor did see them, as he says at  the  mosque;
    but she could not say whether or not he  ever  spoke  to  them  on  the
    phone.

SUBMISSIONS

28. The sponsor's position was that he could disclose  no  further  details
    about his children or his ex-wife, not by order of  any  family  court,
    but because he was not authorized to do so, under the  arrangements  he
    had made with her. Written submissions, contained in letters of various
    dates, and clearly drafted for the appellant and the sponsor by  others
    with some knowledge of English, and the law, insisted that, the sponsor
    and F  being  British  citizens,  the  family  were  entitled  to  stay
    together, come what might. However we are content to take the law  from
    Hayat, as set out at 13.

29.  Mr  Melvin  maintained  that  the  appellant  could  not  satisfy  the
    provisions of the Rules relating to 'unmarried partners', and  so  must
    show such 'exceptional' or 'compelling' features in the  case  (see  MF
    (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192,Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct
    approach)  Pakistan  [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC),  and  Shahzad  (Art   8:
    legitimate aim) Pakistan [2014] UKUT 85  (IAC))  as  to  require  free-
    standing consideration of article 8, if she were  to  succeed  on  this
    appeal.

DISCUSSION

30. Looking at  the  provisions  of  paragraph  295D  of  the  Rules,  this
    appellant could clearly not satisfy the following requirements:

       i) she must have had valid leave for  a  period  of  more  than  six
          months; and

      vi) she and the sponsor must have been living together for two  years
          or more.

    It is also clear that  the  sponsor  is  unable  to  show  satisfactory
    evidence of  his  income  as  a  taxi-driver,  so  cannot  satisfy  the
    maintenance requirements of the Rules, recently  upheld  in  MM  [2014]
    EWCA Civ 986.  It  follows  that  they  do  need  to  show  exceptional
    circumstances, as argued by Mr Melvin.

31. In our view, if we were to  accept  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor's
    account  of  having  simply  fallen  in  love,  without  any   previous
    arrangement, and terminally fallen out with her family, as a result  of
    their clandestine marriage, so that there would be no source of support
    for her, if she had to go back to Bangladesh, taking F, who is  clearly
    too young to be without her, then because of F, this would  be  capable
    of amounting to 'exceptional circumstances'. On the other hand,  if  we
    were not to accept their evidence, but to  find  that  everything  must
    have been arranged in advance, then that might amount  to  a  'sensible
    reason' (see Hayat), for requiring her to return and  apply  for  entry
    clearance from there.

32. This is not of course because there is anything wrong, at least in  the
    eyes of the law, with arranged marriages; but because parties who enter
    into such an arrangement may reasonably be expected to apply for  entry
    clearance in advance. We are content to accept that the appellant,  the
    sponsor and F now have a happy settled family life here,  which,  other
    things being equal, would make  her  return  to  seek  entry  clearance
    disproportionate to the legitimate purpose of . There was  no  evidence
    before us as to how long that process might take; so much  will  depend
    on our findings about the history of the marriage.

33. On the other hand, if parties  to  such  a  marriage,  whether  legally
    recognized or not, were encouraged to think that the early birth  of  a
    child would be treated as a 'trump card', then both the principles  set
    out in ZH (Tanzania) (see 4), and Parliament's policy in approving  the
    Rules would effectively be defeated. The result of this appeal  in  our
    view must depend, for the reasons already set out, on our  findings  of
    fact about how this marriage came about.

FINDINGS OF FACT

34. The appellant was clearly of marriageable  age,  in  Bangladeshi  eyes,
    even when she arrived in this country: there is no suggestion that  the
    qadi who performed the ceremony had any concerns on that score, and  of
    course the Qu'ran itself allows marriage for girls  much  younger  than
    she was. We do not accept that, two years after she  had  finished  her
    education, her family would have let her go to this country  on  a  six
    months' visit with her mother without having some plans for her future,
    whether those were known to her or not.

35. Those plans need not have, and perhaps did not involve  plans  for  any
    specific marriage; but we think her family would  have  been  ready  to
    consider marriage for her, if a suitable opportunity came  forward.  Of
    course the appellant and the sponsor say  they  did  not  consider  him
    suitable, being so much older and married before. On the other hand, he
    did have the unquestionable advantage of a British passport.  What  the
    original motives for their marriage were, we shall have to do our  best
    to decide on the evidence.

36. The appellant and the sponsor disagree about  the  date  of  the  party
    where they first met: a party in June or July, as the sponsor  had  it,
    would not have left much time for the history of events leading  up  to
    the marriage as he gave it. If it  had  been  in  late  April,  as  the
    appellant said, then they would have had a good deal more time  to  get
    to know each other. While we should not expect anyone to be  too  exact
    on dates a couple of years old, it  is  a  little  surprising  to  find
    differences as large as this.

37. There may not be too much difference in their account  of  their  first
    meeting, except for how it ended. The appellant's account of exchanging
    mobile numbers there and then would pass  without  remark  in  an  all-
    English context, either for young  or  not  so  young  people:  but  we
    question whether it is probable in the context of a  young  Bangladeshi
    girl with no English, meeting an older man for the first time. However,
    we do not attach any significant importance to our own  view  on  that,
    compared to the contrast between the appellant's account, and  the  one
    given by the sponsor. If they hadn't exchanged numbers till the end  of
    their meeting out shopping, then  we  can't  think  why  the  appellant
    shouldn't have mentioned that meeting at all, in dealing with how  they
    got together after the party.

38. The next point in the history is the marriage itself. If the  appellant
    were faced with a disapproving family and an expiring visa, then  there
    might have been nothing surprising in her slipping off from them to  go
    through a ceremony arranged by the sponsor, and unknown to them. We are
    surprised by the qadi's apparently being prepared to  conduct  it  with
    only one side present; but again, we attach no  significant  importance
    to our view on that, or to the disagreement as to whether the appellant
    was represented at the ceremony, in accordance with custom, compared to
    what we regard as the significant discrepancy between the appellant  as
    to where she went afterwards, back to her brother's, or,  according  to
    the sponsor, away to the house of a co-operative  aunt,  who  for  some
    reason she hadn't mentioned at all.

39. While both the appellant and the sponsor agree that she moved  in  with
    him about a fortnight  after  the  ceremony,  and  only  began  marital
    relations from then, the question remains as to whether she moved  from
    her brother's, and if so how she got away; or from the aunt's. Needless
    to say, we make every possible allowance for the limitations imposed by
    lack of representation, and their having  to  be  taken  through  their
    accounts by us. However, in our view there are three crucial  sticking-
    points, where these cannot be reconciled.

40. These are about

      a) how the appellant and the sponsor got in  touch  again  after  the
         party,

      b) where she went after the ceremony; and (consequently)

      c) how and from where she went to live with him; and

      d)  why her application of 3 September should have presented  her  as
         already well settled in with him, when both of  them  agreed  that
         she did not move in till about a fortnight after the ceremony,  on
         26 August.

41. The reason all these points  are  important  is  because  they  do  not
    involve what might be called discrepancies for their  own  sake:  there
    was no question of Mr Melvin trying to catch these  witnesses  out,  by
    eliciting contrasting answers on points not  important  in  themselves.
    These were significant disagreements, inherent in the appellant and the
    sponsor's own accounts; and on which their history of a love-match very
    much depended.

42. We do not accept that the appellant  and  the  sponsor  simply  pursued
    whatever relationship they may have had by the end of the party, either
    by immediately exchanging mobile numbers; or by doing so after  he  met
    her by chance out shopping with her mother, who does not seem  to  have
    raised any objection at the time. As for their  different  accounts  of
    where the appellant went after the ceremony, and so from where she went
    to live with  the  sponsor  at  his  flat,  they  either  require  more
    explanation than they got from the appellant as to  how  she  got  away
    from her own family; or (if the sponsor's account were right)  how  she
    came not to mention the  apparently  crucial  involvement  of  the  co-
    operative aunt.

43. Taken together, the effect of these significant points of difference is
    that we cannot accept the appellant and  the  sponsor's  account  of  a
    relationship which developed spontaneously,  and  a  marriage  ceremony
    carried out in the  teeth  of  objection  from  her  family.  The  only
    reasonable conclusion is that the appellant's family must have arranged
    her meeting with, and subsequent marriage  to  the  sponsor.  We  agree
    that, in accordance with custom in the  Indian  sub-continent,  and  no
    doubt to some extent elsewhere, they would  have  had  some  reason  to
    disapprove of him, as a much older man who  had  been  married  before.
    Nor, on his own account, was he able to compensate for this through his
    financial position; in fact the sponsor's only conspicuous advantage as
    a match for the appellant was in his British citizenship.

44. We conclude that this was indeed why the marriage was arranged, and why
    the parties were presented as already settled in together by  the  time
    the application was made for her to have leave to remain on that basis,
    when on both their accounts she had not moved in till 26  August,  only
    just over a week before. The  fact  that  they  chose  to  give  us  an
    entirely different account of what happened shows as well  as  anything
    else that they (or at least the appellant's family, in her  case)  must
    have realized that the truth would not get them what they  wanted  from
    the Home Office.

45. We repeat that there is nothing wrong  with  an  arranged  marriage  in
    itself, and that the appellant and the sponsor, following the birth  of
    F, now clearly have a happy settled family life together. However,  the
    way we have found their marriage was brought about in our view begs the
    question as to why the appellant should not have applied for a  fianc�e
    visa from Bangladesh, in the normal way. We cannot see any satisfactory
    answer to that question.

46. It follows in our view that the lack of any such  answer  both  negates
    the 'exceptional circumstances', which might have been  provided  by  a
    love-match, opposed by the appellant's family, followed by  the  timely
    birth of F; and provides a 'sensible reason' as to why she  should  now
    be required to go back to Bangladesh and through  the  entry  clearance
    process. That might well be troublesome for her; but not by  any  means
    impossible or likely  to  cause  her  undue  hardship,  since,  on  our
    findings of fact, she would have the support of her family  there,  who
    would no doubt be prepared to look after both her and F for the limited
    time necessary. There are no exceptional circumstances, in our view, to
    be found in the private and family life enjoyed by  the  appellant  and
    the sponsor themselves.

47. However, we have not forgotten F, or the sponsor's children  A  and  N,
    all of whose best interests must be a primary consideration for us.  It
    may be that F's best interests would be in favour of his being able  to
    go on living with his mother and father, just  as  he  has  been  doing
    since he was born just over a year ago; but, at  his  age,  we  do  not
    think they would be significantly threatened by his having to  go  with
    the appellant (as no doubt he would), while she went through the  entry
    clearance process in Bangladesh; in fact, since they  would  both  have
    the support of her family over there, it would be a good chance for him
    to meet them.

48. To the extent that his best interests might require anything else, that
    would not be to any significant extent: he is a long way off  going  to
    school, and in reality needs most to be with his mother. While no doubt
    it would be better for him to be with his father too, we do not  regard
    temporary separation from  him  as  a  serious  invasion  of  his  best
    interests. We are not in any case satisfied, given our  findings  about
    the attitude of the appellant's family that it would be impossible  for
    the sponsor to go with her for a limited time, while  she  applied  for
    entry clearance.

49. As for A and N, there is no question,  in  our  view,  of  their  being
    deprived of such contact as they have with their father,  amounting  in
    any case to no more than occasional meetings in the  mosque,  for  more
    than a relatively short time; he, like F, is  a  British  citizen,  and
    there is no reason why either of them should have to go  to  Bangladesh
    for longer than needed to see the appellant through the entry clearance
    process. We don't  think  that  would  involve  anything  significantly
    contrary to their best interests.

50. While there is certainly some public interest in the appellant and  the
    sponsor being allowed to go on bringing up F without  any  interruption
    at all, in our view there is a much stronger one  in  making  it  quite
    clear that the grant of leave to remain to people who  do  not  qualify
    under the Rules approved by Parliament is only to happen in exceptional
    circumstances, and cannot be relied on by those who might choose to try
    and get round them. That exception provides, following the decision  in
    MF (Nigeria), all the necessary scope for real  hard  cases,  of  which
    this is not one.
