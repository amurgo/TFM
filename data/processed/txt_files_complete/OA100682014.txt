For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    The Sponsor


                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 30 September 2015 to allow the  appeal  of
       Faith Kiconco Serunjogi a citizen of Uganda born  11  November  1987,
       against the refusal of entry clearance dated 5 August 2014.


    2. The application was to join her husband in the United Kingdom, and it
       was  refused  because  the  aggregate  earnings  relied   upon   were
       insufficient: his employed earnings with the Epsom and St Helier  NHS
       Trust did not themselves reach the threshold of �18,600 and the self-
       employed earnings he relied on to supplement them were considered not
       to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.


    3. The First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal having heard oral evidence
       from the Sponsor Henry Serunjogi, which it accepted as credible, that
       his earnings exceeded �19,000 annually.  The Judge noted that further
       documents had been brought to court  by  way  of  HMRC  documents,  a
       document issued  by  his  accountant  confirming  his  work  for  the
       company, Makiki Ltd, of which  he  is  the  sole  director,  and  the
       figures required by the HMRC demanding tax.


    4. Grounds of appeal argued that the  findings  of  fact  were  of  such
       brevity that it could not be seen how the appeal  succeeded  applying
       the financial requirements by reference  to  the  relevant  specified
       documents set out in Appendix FM-SE.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on  15  February
       2016 because there was an arguable error  in  the  findings  of  fact
       relating to the evidence before the Judge.


Findings and reasons

    6. The relevant Immigration Rules are these, within Appendix FM-SE:


           "2. In respect of salaried employment in the  UK  (except  where
           paragraph 9 applies), all of  the  following  evidence  must  be
           provided: (a) Payslips covering: (i) a period of 6 months  prior
           to the date of application if the person has  been  employed  by
           their  current  employer  for  at  least  6  months  (and  where
           paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not apply); or
           (ii) any period of salaried  employment  in  the  period  of  12
           months prior to the date of application if the person  has  been
           employed by their current employer for less than 6 months (or at
           least 6 months but the person does not rely on  paragraph  13(a)
           of this Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by  a
           self-employed person.
           (b) A letter from the employer(s) who  issued  the  payslips  at
           paragraph 2(a) confirming:
           (i) the person's employment and gross annual salary;
           (ii) the length of their employment;
           (iii) the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
           level of salary relied upon in the application; and
           (iv) the type of employment (permanent, fixed-term  contract  or
           agency).
           (c) Personal bank statements corresponding to the same period(s)
           as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the  salary  has
           been paid into an account in the name of the person  or  in  the
           name of the person and their partner jointly.
           (d) Where the person is a director of a limited company based in
           the UK, evidence that the company is not of a type specified  in
           paragraph 9(a). This can include the latest Annual Return  filed
           at Companies House.
           (e) Where a person appointed as a non-executive  director  of  a
           limited company based in the UK, which is not a company  of  the
           type specified in paragraph 9(a), is paid a  fee  instead  of  a
           salary, this income may be treated and evidenced  as  though  it
           were income received for employment in that capacity.
           ...
           7. In respect of self-employment in the UK as a  partner,  as  a
           sole trader or in a franchise  all  of  the  following  must  be
           provided:
           (a) Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid and  unpaid  for
           the last full financial year.
           (b) The following documents for the last full financial year, or
           for the last two such years  (where  those  documents  show  the
           necessary level of gross income  as  an  average  of  those  two
           years):
           (i) annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC (a copy or  print-
           out); and
           (ii) Statement of Account (SA300 or SA302).
           (c)  Proof  of  registration  with  HMRC  as  self-employed   if
           available.
           (d) Each partner's Unique Tax Reference Number (UTR) and/or  the
           UTR of the partnership or business.
           (e) Where the person holds or  held  a  separate  business  bank
           account(s), bank statements for the same 12-month period as  the
           tax return(s).
           (f) personal bank statements for the same 12-month period as the
           tax return(s) showing that the income from  self-employment  has
           been paid into an account in the name of the person  or  in  the
           name of the person and their partner jointly.
           (g) Evidence of  ongoing  self-employment  through  evidence  of
           payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions,  or  (where
           the person has reached state pension  age)  through  alternative
           evidence (which may include, but is not confined to, evidence of
           ongoing payment of business  rates,  business-related  insurance
           premiums, employer National Insurance contributions or franchise
           payments to the parent company).
           (h) One of the following documents must also be  submitted:  (i)
           (aa) If the business  is  required  to  produce  annual  audited
           accounts, such accounts for the last full financial year; or
           (bb) If the business is not required to produce  annual  audited
           accounts, unaudited accounts for the last  full  financial  year
           and  an  accountant's  certificate  of  confirmation,  from   an
           accountant who is a member of a UK Recognised  Supervisory  Body
           (as defined in the Companies Act 2006);
           (ii) A certificate of VAT registration and the  VAT  return  for
           the last full financial year (a copy  or  print-out)  confirming
           the VAT registration number, if turnover is in excess of �79,000
           or was in excess of the threshold which applied during the  last
           full financial year;
           (iii) Evidence to show appropriate planning permission or  local
           planning authority consent is held to operate the type/class  of
           business at the trading address (where this is a local authority
           requirement); or
           (iv) A franchise agreement signed by both parties.
           (i) The document referred  to  in  paragraph  7(h)(iv)  must  be
           provided if the organisation is a franchise."


    7. It will  be  seen  that  these  complex  provisions  contain  various
       requirements  which  go  far  beyond  the  mere  calculation  of  net
       earnings.


    8. The authorities recognise that reasons must be  given  for  both  the
       determination of the appeal and the material findings  of  fact  upon
       which that decision is based and they must be provided in  sufficient
       detail to "enable the reader to know  what  conclusion  the  decision
       maker has reached on the principal controversial issues":   see  Lord
       Bridge in Save Britain's Heritage v No 1 Poultry  Ltd  [1991]  1  WLR
       153.


    9.  It  is  very  unfortunate  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  not
       identified the particular Rules which were in issue before it and the
       evidence upon which it was confident that those Rules were satisfied.
       This is particularly important given that the relevant period is that
       leading up  to  the  date  of  application,  whereas  the  First-tier
       Tribunal refers to further documents brought to the Tribunal  hearing
       without clarifying whether these demonstrated the relevant  financial
       requirements in the period leading up to the application  or  at  the
       date of the appeal hearing. As was stated by the Court of  Appeal  in
       Pankina [2010] EWCA Civ 7 at [39]:


           "the question  whether  at  the  date  of  the  application  the
           specified funds had been in the  applicant's  bank  account  for
           three continuous  months  cannot  intelligibly  be  answered  by
           evidence that they had not, albeit they now have been."


   10. It is  accordingly  essential  that  the  income  for  employment  be
       demonstrated for six months prior to the application date  (presuming
       the job has been held for more than six months at that time) and that
       self-employed income be shown  over  the  last  full  financial  year
       before that date. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  does  not
       explain how it is that it was  satisfied  of  these  matters  to  the
       minimum standard required for its ruling to stand.


   11. Before me  Mr  Serunjogi  expressed  dissatisfaction  with  the  Home
       Office's refusal to recognise that  he  had  in  fact  satisfied  the
       relevant Rules and their pursuit of  an  appeal  that  he  considered
       unmeritorious,  but  unfortunately  the  mass  of  documents  on  the
       Tribunal's file did not  appear  to  have  any  explanatory  note  or
       accompanying schedule that  demonstrated  how  the  various  criteria
       above were satisfied at the date of application. He should take steps
       to present the relevant information as efficiently as possible before
       the next hearing - it would doubtless assist the First-tier  Tribunal
       greatly if any bundle provided  was  indexed  and  paginated  with  a
       schedule cross-referencing how it is that every  requirement  of  the
       Rules above are met.






          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of
    law and the appeal is remitted for hearing to the First-tier Tribunal.







Signed:                                            Date: 27 April 2016
