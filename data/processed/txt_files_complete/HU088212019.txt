                            DECISION AND REASONS



Representation (by way of written submissions)

For the appellant:     Synergy Solicitors

For the respondent:    Mr S Kotas, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer






    Background

      1. This appeal comes before me following the grant  of  permission  to
         appeal by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill on 21 February 2020 against the
         determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge T Jones, promulgated  on
         16 September 2019 following a hearing at Bradford  on  9  September
         2019.

      2. The appellant is a Pakistani national born on 16 October  1976  who
         entered the UK as a fiancï¿½  in  April  2002.  Although  an  Islamic
         marriage was said to have taken place, the civil ceremony  did  not
         take place. It is said that this was because the appellant  is  gay
         although there is some conflict in the evidence as to how the bride
         came to know this and whether the decision not to marry was hers or
         the appellant's. In any event, she sought a divorce in 2004.  There
         is no evidence before the Tribunal that it was granted.

      3. The appellant did not embark and the day after his leave expired he
         made an application for indefinite  leave  to  remain  outside  the
         rules which was refused in December 2002. Two weeks later he  filed
         an appeal and this was dismissed on 30 July 2004 and  he  exhausted
         his appeal rights by 17 August 2004. The appellant  still  did  not
         embark  and  eventually  on  17  January  2011  he   made   another
         application for leave outside the rules which was refused  with  no
         right of appeal on 5 February  2011.  It  was  reconsidered  on  12
         November 2011 but the decision was maintained. It  may  be  that  a
         right of appeal was given because the records shows that an  appeal
         was lodged on 30 November 2011 but this was dismissed on  10  April
         2012. He was then served with  notification  of  his  liability  to
         removal. On 10 July 2012 he made a long residency application which
         was refused with no right of appeal on 6 August 2013. He challenged
         the decision by way of a judicial review on  4  December  2014  but
         this was refused on 3 July 2015. Permission to appeal that decision
         was refused on 12 August 2017 and again, following oral renewal, on
         22 September 2017. Meanwhile,  on  10  October  2016,  he  made  an
         application for leave to remain on family and private life  grounds
         which was refused on 5 October 2017. The current decision is  dated
         4 May 2019 and is in response to  another  application  made  on  5
         August 2018. As the appellant raised a fear of return  to  Pakistan
         on account of his sexuality  in  his  application,  the  respondent
         invited him to make an asylum application. This has not been  done.
         None of the previous determinations have been adduced.

      4. The appeal came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  T  Jones  who
         dismissed the appeal.

      5. The appellant sought permission to appeal on  the  basis  that  his
         claim had not been considered on  humanitarian  protection  grounds
         and that his private life  had  not  been  fully  assessed.  It  is
         maintained that the judge did not consider his long  residence  and
         his inability to return to Pakistan. His application was refused by
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Welsh on 13 January 2020. She found  that
         no humanitarian protection  claim  had  been  relied  on  and  that
         although  his  homosexuality  had  been  raised  in   his   witness
         statement, his representative had specifically asked the judge  not
         to make findings on that as confirmed  by  the  judge's  Record  of
         Proceedings.

      6. The appellant renewed his application to the Upper Tribunal and the
         application was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill on 21 February
         2020 who found that it was arguable that the  sexuality  aspect  of
         the claim had not been  withdrawn  and  that  the  judge  had  thus
         arguably failed to make findings on that.

    Covid-19 crisis

      7. Ordinarily, the appeal would have been listed for hearing following
         the grant of permission to appeal but due to the Covid-19  pandemic
         and need to take precautions  against  its  spread,  this  did  not
         happen and directions were sent to the parties on  16  April  2020.
         The parties were asked to present  any  objections  to  the  matter
         being dealt with on the papers and to make any further  submissions
         on the error of law issue within certain time limits.

      8. The respondent replied on 23 May 2020.

      9. Although the appellant appeared to be no longer represented by  his
         solicitors at that stage, a response  was,  indeed,  received  from
         them and from Counsel who had represented him at the hearing.  That
         appears to have been overlooked and on 15 June 2020 another set  of
         directions  was  sent  to  his  representatives  along   with   the
         submissions received from the respondent. They replied with  copies
         of the documents they had sent earlier. On the same date  a  letter
         was also sent direct to the appellant at his home address.

     10. I now proceed to consider the matter. In doing so I have regard  to
         the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (the UT  Rules),
         the judgment of Osborn v The  Parole  Board  [2013]  UKSC  61,  the
         Presidential Guidance Note No 1 2020: Arrangements during the Covid-
         19  pandemic  (PGN)  and  the  Senior  President's  Pilot  Practice
         Direction (PPD). I have regard to the overriding objective which is
         defined in rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules
         2008 as being "to enable the Upper  Tribunal  to  deal  with  cases
         fairly and justly". To this end I have considered that dealing with
         a case fairly and justly includes: dealing with it in ways that are
         proportionate to the importance of the case, the complexity of  the
         issues, etc; avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility
         in the proceedings; ensuring,  so  far  as  practicable,  that  the
         parties are able to participate fully in the proceedings; using any
         special expertise of the Upper Tribunal effectively;  and  avoiding
         delay, so far as compatible with proper consideration of the issues
         (Rule 2(2) UT rules and PGN:5).

     11. I take into account that a full account of the facts are set out in
         the papers, that the arguments for and against the  appellant  have
         been clearly set out and that the parties have been given more than
         one opportunity to make any submissions they wished to and to raise
         any objections to the matter being dealt with on the papers.  I  am
         satisfied that the appellant has been able to  participate  in  the
         process through his representatives and  indeed  that  he  has  put
         forward further representations and documents in  response  to  the
         directions issued. I note that he has not raised any  objection  to
         the matter being dealt with on the papers. I  have  regard  to  the
         importance of the matter to the appellant, to the length of time he
         has been here without leave making various applications to stay and
         consider that a speedy determination of this matter is in his  best
         interests. I am satisfied that I am able to fairly and justly  deal
         with this matter on the papers before me and I now  proceed  to  do
         so.

    Submissions

     12. The respondent's submissions were prepared on 23  May  2020  by  Mr
         Kotas  and   were   made   without   sight   of   the   appellant's
         representative's reply.

     13. Mr Kotas includes a note from the Presenting Officer  who  attended
         the hearing which confirms  that  Counsel  specifically  asked  the
         judge not to make any findings on the  appellant's  sexuality  when
         assessing paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) as the appellant needed  to  seek
         asylum and that this advice was repeated to him by  the  judge.  He
         submits that this is dispositive of the appeal. He points out  that
         the appellant does not allege in his grounds that his counsel  made
         submissions or a concession against his instructions and  that  his
         complaint now that the judge failed to make findings  on  an  issue
         that he, through his representative, expressly told  the  judge  he
         did not want him to make, was wholly  untenable.  It  is  submitted
         that if the Tribunal was not minded to accept this submission, then
         given the fact that the respondent was not in possession of all the
         papers and as the appellant appeared to be unrepresented, a hearing
         would be appropriate. The submissions point out that there may have
         been tactical reasons why the appellant did not wish the  judge  to
         make findings  on  his  sexuality  because  given  the  absence  of
         supporting evidence before the Tribunal this may have  resulted  in
         an adverse finding, including a rejection of his claim to  be  gay,
         which would have been a starting  point  for  any  future  decision
         maker in protection claim.

     14. The appellant's representatives have responded to directions with a
         bundle of documents which include a note from Counsel dated 14  May
         2020, what is said to be the appellant's further submissions  dated
         14 May 2020 and a letter from his GP dated 9 March 2020. Counsel in
         his note maintains that he has no record of the case on his  laptop
         because of a technical error with his hard drive which resulted  in
         a loss of data. From memory, he maintains that he would have argued
         that there would be very  significant  obstacles  to  reintegration
         impacting on his private life on return. He states there is  little
         more that he can add in the circumstances.

     15. The appellant's statement is essentially a shorter version  of  the
         statement submitted in support of his appeal to  the  Tribunal.  He
         confirms that he was pressured into  marriage  by  his  family  who
         believed that he would no longer be gay once he was  married.  When
         he told his future wife that he was unable to marry her she did not
         support him and this brought shame upon his  family.  He  maintains
         that he has built a private life here  and  has  many  friends.  It
         would be unreasonable for him to return to Pakistan as he no longer
         has contact with his family. He suffers  from  depression  and  the
         thought of returning to a life where he would have to suppress  his
         sexuality causes him anxiety.

     16. The note from his GP is almost identical to the earlier note before
         the judge. It confirms that the appellant has  been  registered  at
         his practice since 2006, that he is depressed and on medication for
         his depression and that he depends on friends as he  is  unable  to
         work here.

    The legal framework

     17. The judge properly took into account the rules and the tests to  be
         applied at paragraphs 8 and 28 of his determination.

    Discussion and Conclusions

     18. I have considered all the evidence, the determination of the First-
         tier Tribunal Judge, the grounds for permission and the submissions
         of the parties.

     19. This is a case which essentially rests  on  whether  the  appellant
         through his Counsel asked the judge not to  make  findings  on  his
         sexuality. If it is shown that he did so, then his  complaint  that
         the matter was not assessed is untenable. If he did not,  then  the
         judge has erred in not making findings on the matter.

     20. It is unhelpful that there is no contemporaneous note from Counsel.
         His recollection that he  would  have  argued  the  issue  of  very
         significant obstacles on return does not  advance  the  appellant's
         case as the judge did indeed take that  issue  into  account.  What
         would have been helpful would have been Counsel's  recollection  on
         whether the issue of sexuality was specifically exempted  from  the
         judge's consideration on the appellant's instructions.

     21. In the absence of Counsel's notes of proceeding, I have the judge's
         record and the record of the Presenting Officer. The latter  agrees
         with the judge's contention  that  a  finding  on  the  appellant's
         sexuality was specifically not sought.   There would be  no  reason
         for the PO to make such a note if such a request had not been  made
         by Counsel. I note that when  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Gill  granted
         permission, she did not have this confirmation before her.

     22. The judge's determination was prepared on  the  same  date  as  the
         hearing (although promulgated a few days  later).  It  is  safe  to
         assume that his recollection of the events  of  the  hearing  were,
         therefore,  fresh in his mind and that the contents  of  paragraphs
         23-24 are a correct record of what transpired at the  hearing.  The
         Record of Proceedings also confirm that only private life was to be
         relied on and that in his submissions Counsel did not rely  on  the
         appellant's sexuality as a matter for assessment. I am,  therefore,
         satisfied having taken all the evidence of the hearing into account
         that it was Counsel's clear position that the sexuality  aspect  of
         the case had to be considered as part of a protection  claim  which
         the appellant would have to make and that the  private  life  claim
         consisted of his length of residence, friendships,  and  reasonable
         command of English even though he  had  used  an  interpreter.   No
         submission was made that the  appellant's  sexuality  would  impact
         upon his ability to reintegrate on return. As  pointed  out  by  Mr
         Kotas, there  was  a  dearth  of  supporting  evidence  as  to  the
         appellant's sexuality (indeed an absence of any  evidence  relating
         to the appellant's private life) and the appellant  may  have  been
         tactically  avoiding  a  finding  which  would  place  him   at   a
         disadvantage when his protection claim was considered.

     23. There was no humanitarian protection claim argued  or  indeed  made
         and so the judge did not err in failing to assess it.

     24. The evidence before the judge on private life consisted essentially
         of the very brief oral evidence of the appellant  and  a  statement
         from a friend who said the appellant had made a life for himself in
         the UK. There was no other evidence as to the nature of that  life,
         his activities or how he had integrated into  the  community  here.
         His doctor's note confirmed he was on medication for depression but
         there was no  evidence  before  the  judge  to  suggest  that  such
         medication would not be available in Pakistan. The judge considered
         that the appellant's residence had always been  precarious/unlawful
         and that he could have no expectation of being permitted to stay on
         that basis. He had lived 25 years in Pakistan and remained familiar
         with  the  culture  and  language  (as  shown  by  his  use  of  an
         interpreter and his involvement with Pakistani friends). Given  the
         restrictions  placed  on  the  judge  by  the  appellant  and   his
         representative and the lack  of  supporting  evidence  adduced,  no
         other outcome was possible.

     25. Accordingly, it was open to the judge to dismiss the appeal and his
         determination contains no errors of law.

     26. It remains open to the appellant to make a claim for protection  as
         he was advised to both by his Counsel and the judge. His  claim  of
         being gay and any fear he may have of return on that basis can then
         be properly assessed.




         Decision

     27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error
         of law and it is upheld. The appeal is dismissed.

         Anonymity

     28. The First-tier Tribunal judge did not make an anonymity  order  but
         to protect the identity of the appellant in any  future  protection
         claim, and pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
         Tribunal) Rules 2008 I make an anonymity order.

     29. Unless the Upper Tribunal or a court directs otherwise, no  reports
         of these proceedings of  any  form  of  publication  thereof  shall
         directly or  indirectly  identify  the  appellant.  This  direction
         applies to, amongst others, the appellant and the  respondent.  Any
         failure to comply with this direction could give rise  to  contempt
         of court proceedings.
