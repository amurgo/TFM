For the Appellant:     Mr M Chowdhury, Legal Representative
                  instructed by Kalam Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh and was born  on  29  December
    1986.

 2. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Blum who, in a determination dated  15  February  2013,  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal for further leave to remain  as  a  student  and  on
    Article 8 grounds.

 3. This appeal concerns the correct date for assessing  maintenance  where
    an outstanding variation for leave  to  remain  is  varied  before  the
    respondent makes a decision.

 4. The background to this case is as follows. The  appellant  entered  the
    United Kingdom (UK) on 13 August 2008 as a student and remained here in
    that capacity with lawful leave until 29 February 2012.  He  then  made
    an in time application  for  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Migrant on 29 February 2012. His application was made on  the
    basis that he would continue his studies at Lincolns  College,  London.
    On 23 May 2012 the respondent revoked the licence of this college.  The
    respondent informed the appellant of this in  a  letter  dated  6  June
    2012.  The letter invited Mr Habib either to withdraw  his  application
    and make a new one or to vary the existing application.  Mr Habib chose
    to vary the existing Tier 4 application, submitting a  new  Certificate
    of Acceptance of Studies (CAS) on 4 August 2012.  On 17 August 2012  he
    provided further financial evidence. On 23 October 2012 the  respondent
    refused his application for further leave to remain.

 5. The respondent refused the application under HC  395  (the  Immigration
    Rules) only  on  the  grounds  of  maintenance.  The  parties  were  in
    agreement that the appellant was required to show funds of �1,600 for a
    consecutive 28 day period. The question here was, which 28 period? That
    prior to 29 February 2012, the date of the initial application or  that
    prior to 4 August 2012, the date of the variation application?

 6. The parties both referred to paragraph 1A (h)  of  Appendix  C  of  the
    Immigration Rules which says as follows about the 28  day  period  that
    must be evidenced in order to meet the maintenance requirements:

         "... the end date of the 90-day and  28-day  periods  ...  will  be
         taken as the date of the closing balance on the most recent of  the
         specific documents, and must be no earlier than 31 days before  the
         date of application."

 7. The respondent's position was that this meant that the appellant had to
    show that for a continuous 28 day period during the 31  days  before  4
    August 2012, the appellant had to show funds of �1,600.  The  appellant
    does not dispute that he  cannot  show  that  he  met  the  maintenance
    requirement for such a period (or any other period except that prior to
    the initial application made on 29 February 2012).

 8. The appellant's case is that "the date of application" in paragraph  1A
    (h) is 29 February 2012, the date of his initial application  and  that
    the respondent was wrong to consider 4  August  2012  as  the  relevant
    date.

 9.  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge  Blum,  in  essence,  agreed   with   the
    respondent's position. So, for a number of reasons, do I.

10. For the appellant, Mr Chowdhury  relied  on  the  respondent's  Tier  4
    Policy Guidance, the relevant extracts of which were contained at pages
    5 and 6 of the appellant's bundle. Mr  Chowdhury  maintained  that  the
    Policy Guidance does not state  that  further  financial  evidence  was
    required to support a variation application. It indicated only  that  a
    new CAS was needed. Where the Policy Guidance did not ask for financial
    evidence when making a variation application, the respondent could  not
    be correct in taking the "the date of application" in paragraph 1A  (h)
    of Appendix C as the date of the variation. Therefore, according to  Mr
    Chowdhury, paragraph 1A (h) of Appendix C must refer  to  the  need  to
    meet the maintenance requirements at date of the  initial  application,
    not at the date of the variation.

11. What the Policy Guidance says, however, as relevant to  the  appellant,
    is:

         "If your permission to stay has expired whilst you were awaiting  a
         decision on your application we will  delay  the  refusal  of  your
         application for 60 days to allow you to obtain a  new  CAS  from  a
         different sponsor and vary your application or leave the UK."

12. I did not accept that this could read, as Mr Chowdhury  would  have  me
    do, as a clear statement that only a  new  CAS  would  be  required  in
    support  of  the  variation  application  and  the  financial  evidence
    submitted with the initial application would be sufficient. It  appears
    to me that the Policy Guidance sets out two stages, obtaining  the  CAS
    and using this to go on to make the variation application.  It  is  not
    stating that merely obtaining a new CAS and submitting it can amount to
    a variation application. The Policy Guidance does not  purport  to  set
    out everything that is needed in support of the variation  application.
    In addition, it is guidance and clearly not  intended  to  replace  the
    maintenance requirements set out in paragraph 1A (h) of Appendix C.  It
    cannot be used to interpret Appendix C in the manner  suggested  by  Mr
    Chowdhury.

13. Further, the reported case of Qureshi (Tier 4 - effective  variation  -
    App C) Pakistan ]2011] UKUT 00412 (IAC) also considered  the  situation
    of a Tier 4 Student application where  the  appellant  had  varied  the
    application whilst awaiting a decision from the  respondent.   At  [38]
    the Upper Tribunal found as follows:

         "As to the date the respondent is required to take into account for
         the purposes of determining the points to be awarded under Appendix
         C, where there has been a variation substituting a new college,  it
         is the date of the  most  recent  variation  for  the  purposes  of
         paragraph 1A(c) [of Section 3C(5) of the 1971 Act] (my emphasis)."

14. The Upper Tribunal in  Qureshi  went  on  to  find  at  [39]  that  the
    "effective date of application for the purposes of calculation  of  the
    funding requirements" was the date that the appellant in that case  had
    varied her application, note the date of her initial application.

15. In addition, if more were needed, the respondent's  letter  of  6  June
    2012 clearly informed the appellant that he  was  expected  to  provide
    further financial evidence showing that as of the time of his variation
    application he had sufficient finances. This information  was  in  bold
    and headed with the words "Important - please note". That  appeared  to
    me to amount to sufficient notice to the appellant that  he  needed  to
    provide further financial evidence if he was going to make a  variation
    application. There was nothing confusing about this. It is not  in  any
    way inconsistent with the Policy Guidance or the wording  of  paragraph
    1A (h) of Appendix C.

16. It was therefore my view that Judge Blum did not err  in  refusing  the
    appellant's appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  as  the  maintenance
    requirements were not  met.  The  relevant  date  for  considering  the
    maintenance requirements was 4 August 2012, the date of  the  variation
    application. As above, the appellant has conceded  that  he  could  not
    show that he had the required funds for a continuous 28 day  period  in
    the 31 day period prior to 4 August 2012.  It was not suggested  before
    me that the ratio of  Khatel  &  Others  (s85A:  effect  of  continuing
    application) Nepal [2013] UKUT 44 (IAC) on the period that can be taken
    to amount to being part of an application had  any  materiality  in  Mr
    Habib's appeal. The appeal under the Immigration Rules could  not  have
    succeeded before Judge Blum and no error of law arises.

17. I also do not accept that Judge Blum erred in his consideration of  the
    appellant's Article 8 claim.  He sets out the correct legal approach at
    [24] and relevant case law at [25].  At [26] he takes into account  the
    appellant's evidence as to the difficulties he experienced in providing
    further financial evidence  for  the  variation  application.   He  was
    clearly entitled not to take the appellant's evidence in that regard at
    its highest.  At [27] the judge considered correctly the  case  of  CDS
    (PBS "available" Article 8) Brazil) [2010] UKUT 305.  It  was  open  to
    him to find that the appellant had not built up a private life  of  any
    substance or that, even if he had a private life  in  the  UK,  it  was
    "ordinarily  by  its  very  nature  of  a  type  which  can  be  formed
    elsewhere".  This was not a case where the Article 8 claim  could  have
    succeeded where it did not under the Immigration Rules.

18. I should  add  that  the  respondent's  decision  of  23  October  2012
    contained an order under Section 47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.  It has been  found  by  the  Upper  Tribunal  in
    Adamally and Jaferi (section 47 removal decisions: Tribunal Procedures)
    [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC) that such an order made in these  circumstances
    is not in accordance with the law but that the  unlawfulness  does  not
    infect the decision to refuse to vary leave to remain. I found that the
    First-tier Tribunal made an error on a point of law in failing to  find
    the Section 47 removal decision to be not in accordance with the law. I
    also set aside that part of the decision and re-make  it,  finding,  in
    line with Adamally and Jaferi, that the removal  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the  law.  If  the  respondent  wishes  to  remove  the
    appellant, she will have to re-make that decision.

Decision

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal on the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and Article 8 of the ECHR does not disclose an  error
    on a point of law and shall stand.

20. The First-tier Tribunal made an error on a point of law as regards  the
    Section 47 order, failing to address its illegality.  I set aside  only
    that limited part of the decision.   I  remake  it,  finding  that  the
    Section 47 order was not in accordance with the law.

21. No anonymity order is made.
