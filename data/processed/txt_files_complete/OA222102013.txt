               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr C Harris of Counsel
For the respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department and the
    respondent is a national of Pakistan born on  3  March  1989.  I  shall
    however for the sake of convenience, refer to the Secretary of State as
    the appellant and Mr Ali as the appellant which  are  the  designations
    that the parties had in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal against  the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge Ince dated 28  January  2015  allowing
    the appellant's appeal pursuant to paragraph ECP 1.1 (d) of Appendix FM
    of the Immigration Rules. (E -ECP 2.6 and 2.10)

 3. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-Tier  Judge  M  Robinson
    dated 11 March 2015 stating that it was arguable that the Judge  failed
    to give adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the  appellant  met  the
    specified document requirements of Appendix FM at paragraph 7 (a) (i).

    First-tier Tribunal's findings

 4.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  made  the   following   findings   in   his
    determination which I summarise.

      i. Paragraph 30 "I was satisfied that the sponsor told me the truth
         when she appeared before me. She gave her evidence in a
         straightforward manner, was not evasive or inventive, being quite
         prepared to admit to not knowing an answer to a particular
         question. Her evidence was consistent with what the appellant had
         stated and backed up by unchallenged documentation. She was not
         shaken in cross-examination and appeared to be totally at ease with
         her testimony. In addition, she volunteered potentially damaging
         information, such as conforming that accountant had not seen or
         read her books which I doubt she would have done if she was trying
         to hide something".

     ii. Paragraph 32 "I will be allowing the appeal on the basis that I
         consider that is nothing other than the genuine marriage, that the
         marriage is subsisting and that each of the couple has the
         intention to live permanently with each other. I therefore allow
         the appeal under paragraph EC-P. 1.1 (d) with reference to
         paragraph E ECP. 2.6 and 2.10"

    iii. Paragraph 41 "in relation to the financial aspect of the matter, I
         accept that the sponsor is self-employed as she states, that she
         earns the money she says she earns and that such is more than
         sufficient to maintain a couple and their daughter in accordance
         with the rules. I see no reason not to accept that, as she runs an
         exclusively cash business, she does not bank all her takings but
         keeps some cash for business and personal expenditure. This would
         make sense and it is not out of the ordinary for cash businesses.
         It therefore follows that there is a reasonable explanation for the
         bank statements not tallying with the stated takings. I take
         account of Mr Sobowale's submissions but agree with Mr Hotes's
         submissions about relying upon the figures disclosed to HMRC-I
         doubt that many people would deliberately overstate their income to
         achieve the advantage that Mr Sobowale suggests, especially as
         nobody likes paying more tax than they should. I see no reason,
         therefore, not to place reliance upon the tax returns as an
         accurate quantification of her income. I allow the appeal under
         paragraph E ECP. 3. 3".

    The grounds of appeal

 5. The grounds of appeal state the following which I summarise. The  Judge
    has assumed the role of primary  decision  maker  in  relation  to  the
    income threshold point. He states that  all  specified  documents  have
    been submitted however this is far from clear  from  the  determination
    because it is unclear whether the sponsor is self-employed, or  whether
    she operates a business as a company. The sponsor's business  or  self-
    employment commenced on 1 August 2012,  which  was  only  three  months
    prior to the date of decision. Therefore the required full tax year  of
    evidence could not be assessed, this evidence is required  by  appendix
    FM 7(a)(i). Furthermore the appellant asserts that the sponsor tax year
    ends on 31 July each year. If this is the case she must  be  running  a
    company, rather than being self-employed. In which case her CT 600 form
    (company tax return) should have been submitted. The  end  of  the  tax
    year for those who are self-employed is 5  April.  The  Judge  has  not
    adequately resolve this issue and has not given  adequate  reasons  for
    his findings.

 6. At the hearing it was accepted by the Senior  Presenting  Officer  that
    the respondent does not wish to pursue her appeal in  relation  to  the
    fraud aspect of the case. I will therefore not set out the  grounds  of
    appeal in relation to this ground.

    The hearing

 7. The Senior Presenting Officer stated that he relies on his  grounds  of
    appeal other than that  of  fraud  and  said  that  only  three  months
    finances were available and there is no evidential flexibility in  such
    an appeal.

 8. Mr Harris submitted that at page 57 of the bundle  of  the  appellant's
    documents, contains all the evidence that the Judge took  into  account
    in reaching his decision.  These  are  the  HMRC  documents  where  the
    sponsors stated income is �23,668+ �16,446 for two years and  therefore
    averages to �20,057 which is over the income threshold. The appellant's
    child is a British citizen and  therefore  the  relevant  threshold  is
    �18,000 as British citizen children do not have to  be  considered  for
    financial requirements.

    Decision on the error of law

 9. The respondent withdrew the grounds of appeal in respect of  fraud  and
    therefore I will not  consider  this  ground  of  appeal.  I  like  the
    permission Judge do not find that the Judge misdirected himself  as  to
    the law and facts for the reasons he set out  at  paragraph  33-36.  He
    also set out the reasons why he accepted the evidence for  reasons  set
    out in paragraph 37-40 of the determination.

10. The only issue in  the  appeal  therefore  is  whether  the  First-Tier
    Tribunal Judge materially erred when he found that  the  appellant  had
    satisfied the requirements of s7 of Appendix FM- SE for entry clearance
    to the United Kingdom as the spouse of a British citizen.

11. The Judge in a very careful determination  analysed  the  evidence  and
    found that the appellant does meet the requirement. He referred to  the
    sponsor's cogent evidence to demonstrate  that  she  has  the  relevant
    level of earnings to sponsor the appellant.

12. The appellant sponsor stated that she  has  been  self  employed  as  a
    tailor since 1 August 2012. The appellant made her  application  on  23
    August 2013 which is more than one year after she started her tailoring
    business. The respondent's refusal letter states that the decision  was
    made on 22 November 2012. Senior presenting officer accepted that there
    was a typographical error in the ECO's letter and refusal  was  on  "23
    April 2013." Therefore there is obviously a mistake when the respondent
    states in her grounds of appeal that "the sponsor's business  or  self-
    employment commenced on 1 August 2012,  which  was  only  three  months
    prior to the date of decision on 22 November 2012." It  is  clear  from
    the evidence that the appellant made an application more than one  year
    after she started her business. At the hearing Mr Harris explained that
    the appellant waited for a full year after  she  started  her  business
    before she made her application to enable her to meet the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.

13. The evidence of earnings before the Judge was  from  1  August  2012-23
    August 2013. The relevant tax year taken  into  account  therefore  was
    April 2013 /2014. In that event that would only leave five  months  and
    this is covered by the previous tax year and taking the average of  the
    two years income was taken into account  by  the  Judge.  I  accept  Mr
    Harris's submissions that Appendix FM 13  (e)  states  that  for  self-
    employment the total gross of income should be taken as the average  of
    the last two years. He took into account the sponsors bank  statements,
    tax return, tax due and the Inland Revenue  reference  number  together
    with the sponsor's accountant's letter and interim accounts.

14. The sponsor's accounts dated 24 December 2013 included her accounts for
    the period 1 August 2012 to 31 March 2013 showed her  net  earnings  of
    �16,446. The Judge considered that the accounts for the  full  year  of
    trading from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013  showed  taxable  income  of
    �24,516 which was evidenced by a 2013 tax return  document.  The  Judge
    further took into account further documents such  as,  a  statement  of
    account of tax due and paid dated 24 September 2014, a letter dated  11
    August 2014 from the sponsor's former accountants, a  letter  dated  22
    September 2014 from her current accountants which confirm that the  net
    income for the period 1 April 2013 to 31 March 2014 was �23 668.

15. The Judge found that the appellant is required to demonstrate that  the
    sponsor earns �22,400 such as to include �3800 for the first  child  on
    top of the �18,600 and that both the first full trading  year  produced
    earnings of �24,516 and the full tax year  figure  of  �23,668  exceeds
    this amount although I accept Mr Harris's submissions �3800 should  not
    have been taken into account because the child is  a  British  citizen.
    This would  place  the  appellant  sponsor's  income  well  above  that
    required.

16. It is clear from the  determination  that  the  Judge  found  that  the
    appellant started her business on 1 August 2012. He found that she  has
    earned in the last two tax years, from her business more  than  �18,600
    as required for the maintenance requirement of the  Immigration  Rules.
    These are sustainable findings on the evidence.

17. The Judge placed reliance on the figures disclosed by  the  sponsor  to
    the HMRC and stated that nobody likes paying more tax than they  should
    and therefore  the  figures  stated  are  true.  The  Judge  found  the
    appellant credible and therefore placed reliance upon the sponsor's tax
    returns as an accurate quantification of the appellant sponsor's income
    which he found to  be  proved.  He  did  not  accept  the  Home  Office
    presenting Officer's speculation  that  the  sponsor  has  deliberately
    inflated her income and was prepared to pay the extra  income  tax,  to
    gain the advantage of sponsoring her husband. The Judge was so entitled
    to so find.

18. The Judge at paragraph 41 found that the sponsor runs a  cash  business
    and does not bank all her takings but keeps up cash  for  business  and
    personal expenditure. He found this to be  reasonable  explanation  for
    why the statements do not tally with the stated takings and this cannot
    be considered as a perverse conclusion on the evidence.

19. I find that a material error of law has not  been  established  in  the
    determination. In the circumstances the respondent's appeal must fail.
