          Notice of withdrawal of case pursuant to paragraph 17 of
       The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended)

1. The appellant appealed against a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
   which dismissed the appeal on asylum and human rights grounds.

2. Subsequent to a hearing before UTJ  Dawson  on  6th  November  2014,  the
   appellant  (who  has  an  application  pending  before  the   respondent)
   requested permission to withdraw  the  instant  appeal.  There  being  no
   objection from the respondent, I consent to the withdrawal  of  the  case
   before the Upper Tribunal.

     Anonymity

   The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of  the
   Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

   I continue that order (pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
   (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

   Date:      24 April 2015                  Signed
