                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction


 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First Tier Tribunal ("FTT")
    Judge R Sullivan, sent out on 24 July 2019, dismissing the appellants'
    appeals against the Secretary of States' refusal to grant indefinite
    leave to remain.






    The Background


 2. The appellants are married. The first appellant was born in Pakistan on
    17 July 1982 and first entered the United Kingdom as a student on 4
    September 2006.  He was granted leave to remain until 31 March 2010. On
    5 March 2010 he applied for further leave to remain as a tier 1 post
    study work migrant and leave was granted to 20 March 2012. On 2 April
    2011 he applied for further leave to remain as a tier 1 general
    migrant. On 21 May 2013 he applied for further leave which was granted
    until 3 July 2016.


 3. The second appellant was born in Pakistan on 17 April 1988 and first
    entered the United Kingdom on 4 March 2016 as the first appellant's
    spouse. She was granted leave to enter until 3 July 2016.


 4. On 22 April 2017 the first appellant made an application for indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of 10 years' lawful residence. The second
    appellant applied for indefinite leave to remain on 22 April 2017
    relying in her husband's application.


 5. The first appellant's application was refused on 20 December 2018 and
    the second appellants was refused on 28 January 2019. The first
    appellant's refusal was based on earnings declarations made in respect
    of the tax years 2010/2011 and 2012/2013. There was a discrepancy
    between the earnings declared to the Home office for those periods in
    respect of his immigration applications and the earnings declared to
    HMRC for tax purposes. The Secretary of State refused the application
    relying on paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules, on the ground
    that the it was undesirable to permit the first appellant to remain in
    the United Kingdom. The second appellant's application was in effect
    tied to that of her husband. The parties proceed on the basis that the
    outcome of her appeal is parasitic upon her husband's appeal (see
    paragraph 9 of the FTT decision).






    Discrepancy Details


 6. In his tax return for the year 2010/11 the first appellant declared
    PAYE income of �18,462 and no income from self-employed earnings. A
    neighbour prepared the tax return for him. On or about 2 April 2011 the
    first appellant declared his earnings to the Secretary for the 2010/11
    tax year as including �12,985 of self-employed earnings. On 11 November
    2015 the first appellant informed HMRC that he had in fact earned a
    profit of �12,985 from self-employed in the tax year 2010/11. On 4 May
    2016 the first appellant was assessed on the basis of the new
    declaration to pay further tax in the sum of �3,179.40 plus interest
    bringing the total to �3,585.86.


 7. In the immigration application made on 21 May 2013 the first appellant
    claimed to have income from self-employment in the tax year 2012/13 of
    �7,260. In his tax return for the same year, which he completed on-
    line, he declared no income from self-employment. On 27 February 2014,
    a matter of weeks after filing the return, he made a voluntary
    declaration to HMRC of a profit from self-employed income of �6,650.






    The Appeal


 8. Although no right of appeal lies against a refusal to refuse indefinite
    leave to remain, it is here accepted that the appellant's Art.8 rights
    are engaged. A right of appeal therefore lies.


 9. Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules specifically gives rise to a
    presumption the leave will be refused as a result of:

         "the undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
         the United Kingdom in the light of his conduct (including
         convictions which do not fall within paragraph 322(1C)), character
         or associations or the fact that he represents a threat to national
         security."

10. The FTT Judge found that the first appellant had been dishonest in
    respect of income declared to HMRC in the tax years 2010 to 2011 and
    2012 to 2013. We will refer in more detail to her careful decision
    below.


11. The grounds of appeal are detailed and lengthy, but can fairly be
    summarised in the main as asserting that the FTT Judge made material
    errors of law by failing to address the correct test when determining
    dishonesty. We deal with the grounds of appeal at paragraphs 33 and
    onwards below.






    The correct approach to dishonesty


12. The correct approach to be taken by the Tribunal when dealing with
    questions of dishonesty in earnings discrepancy cases under para.322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules is set out in the Court of Appeal decision in
    R (Balajigari) v SSHD [2019] 1 WLR 4647.


13. We will consider the correct approach in some detail and then go on to
    ask ourselves of the FTT has failed to follow that correct approach.


14. In order to put the issue of dishonesty in context, it is necessary to
    look at paragraphs 34 to 40 of Balajigari. Briefly, in considering the
    "undesirability" of permitting a person to remain in the United
    Kingdom, the Secretary of State should have: "...reliable evidence of
    ....sufficiently reprehensible conduct" and then undertake "an
    assessment, taking proper account of all relevant circumstances known
    about the applicant at the date of the decision, of whether his
    presence on the UK is undesirable (this should include positive
    features of their character)" (see para.34 of Baljigari). This
    assessment is referred to as the balancing exercise (see para.38 and
    130).


15. Once the question of undesirability is dealt with, a discretion arises
    (see Baljigari para.39). This appeal is not concerned with the exercise
    of the discretion and we need say no more about it.


16. In an earnings discrepancy case, the provision by the applicant of
    inaccurate earnings figures to HMRC or to the Secretary of State is
    capable of constituting "reliable evidence of sufficiently
    reprehensible conduct", but only if there is a finding that the
    inaccurate figures were provided "dishonestly" (at para.37(2) the Court
    of Appeal noted that "in the context of an earnings discrepancy case it
    is very hard to see how the deliberate and dishonest submission of
    false earnings figures whether to HMRC or to the Home Office [would not
    be "sufficiently reprehensible" and so not reach the necessary level of
    dishonesty]".


17. If satisfied that inaccurate figures were provided dishonestly, the
    next step would be to assess, taking proper account of all relevant
    circumstances known about the applicant at the date of the decision,
    whether his continued presence in the UK is undesirable. That exercise
    is clearly important and should be carried out in a balanced way. It
    should include positive features of the applicant's character
    (Balajigari para.35) but will also (given that it is undertaken after,
    and in the light of, a finding about dishonesty) be taken against the
    background of the finding of dishonesty.


18. A significant difference between the income declared to the Secretary
    of State and income declared to HMRC is therefore, of itself, not
    enough to justify a conclusion (even a rebuttal conclusion) of
    dishonesty. There must be more. A significant difference in declared
    earnings is sufficient to raise a suspicion of dishonesty. In order
    fairly to deal with the suspicion, the applicant should be given an
    opportunity to provide any innocent (or at least, non-dishonest)
    explanation. If the applicant is asked for an explanation and provides
    none, or provides an explanation the Secretary of State finds to be
    unconvincing, it may be appropriate for the Secretary of State to
    "infer" dishonesty (see Balijigari at para.42). To put it another way,
    the Secretary of State must decide, considering the discrepancy in the
    light of any explanation (or the lack of an explanation) if the
    discrepancy is dishonest.


19. As to the "inference" of dishonesty, we remind ourselves, as Lord
    Neuberger explains at paragraph 126 of Stack v Dowden [2007] 2 AC 432,
    that "an inferred intention is one which is objectively deduced to be
    the subjective actual intention of the parties, in the light of their
    actions and statements".


20. In stating the position in this way, the Court of Appeal emphasised
    that there should be no inference of dishonesty until all of the
    disagreed with the view expressed by Martin Spencer J in Shahbaz Khan
    [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) that a significant difference between declared
    incomes, entitled the Secretary of State to draw an inference that the
    applicant had been deceitful or dishonest and that once that inference
    had been drawn the applicant would have an opportunity to present
    evidence to displace it and the Secretary of State would then need to
    "carefully consider any case advanced that the discrepancy is the
    result of carelessness rather than dishonesty".


21. Dealing with the question of standard of proof the Court of Appeal
    agreed with Martin Spencer J's approach in Khan that the Secretary of
    State must be satisfied that dishonesty has occurred, the standard of
    proof being the balance of probabilities but bearing in mind the
    serious nature of the allegation and the serious consequences which
    follow from such a finding of dishonesty. This is because what is being
    asserted by the Secretary of State is that an applicant for ILR has
    been dishonest. That is a serious allegation, carrying with it serious
    consequences (see para.43 of Baljigari).


22. The guidance in Balijigari (see para.37) on the exercise of determining
    dishonesty is succinct and focussed. The Court of Appeal refer to
    para.74 of Ivey v Genting Casinos [2018] AC 391 at para.37(1) of the
    judgment. Para.74 provides (insofar as relevant as follows):

         "When dishonesty is in question the fact-finding tribunal must
         first ascertain (subjectively) the actual state of the individual's
         knowledge or belief as to the facts. The reasonableness or
         otherwise of his belief is a matter of evidence (often in practice
         determinative) going to whether he held the belief, but it is not
         an additional requirement that his belief must be reasonable; the
         question is whether it is genuinely held. When once his actual
         state of mind as to knowledge or belief as to facts is established,
         the question whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is to be
         determined by the fact-finder by applying the (objective) standards
         of ordinary decent people. There is no requirement that the
         defendant must appreciate that what he has done is, by those
         standards, dishonest."

23. However, the Court of Appeal go on to note (para.37(1)) that, in
    practice, a Tribunal is unlikely to need to make any reference to these
    principles. It seems to us that the guidance set out in Balijigari at
    para.42 allows the fact finder to approach the question without
    reference to the detail of Genting. The decision maker must consider
    the discrepancy in the light of the explanation given and may then come
    to the conclusion that the applicant has been dishonest. In so doing
    the decision maker is bound to apply "the (objective) standards of
    ordinary decent people".


24. To summarise the correct approach set out by the Court of Appeal in
    Balajigari, assuming there is a significant difference in declared
    incomes, the Secretary of State should seek an explanation for the
    difference. She should then consider, in light of the explanation
    whether the applicant was acting dishonestly in declaring significantly
    different incomes. If she concludes that there is no dishonesty that is
    an end of the matter. If, on the other hand, she decides that there was
    dishonesty, then she must go on to conduct a balancing exercise, taking
    account of all relevant factors and decide if the applicant's continued
    presence in the United Kingdom is undesirable. If she concludes it is
    not, that is an end of the matter. If she concludes it is, the
    discretion then arises.






    The Decision


25. At paragraphs 10 to 13 of the FTT decision, the Judge sets out the law.
    The Judge rightly identifies at paragraph 11 that guidance as to the
    burden and standard of proof in respect of dishonesty in cases such as
    this is to be found in Khan and Balajigari. Those cases clearly
    establish that the burden is on the Secretary of State to establish
    dishonesty and that the standard of proof is the balance of
    probabilities (bearing in mind the serious nature of the allegation and
    the serious consequences which follow from such a finding of
    dishonesty) see para.43 of Balajigari.


26. The FTT Judge had before her evidence from the appellants in the form
    of witness statements. She heard oral evidence form the first
    appellant. The second appellant's witness statement was agreed. She had
    a witness statement from the first appellant's neighbour. He was not
    called to give evidence and his statement was not agreed. The FTT
    therefore had before it a good deal of evidence of the first
    appellant's explanation for the discrepancy between both tax returns
    and declarations made to the Home Office.


27. At paragraph 19 of the decision the FTT judge sets out the factors that
    apply to both returns (both discrepancies). One such factor is specific
    to the first appellant (he is an IT expert and holds a Masters Degree
    in Accounting and Information Systems) the remaining 2 are generic. The
    FTT Judge took account of the fact that the online tax return system
    works by posing a number of initial questions the answers to which
    determine the next step. For example, the system will ask if the
    taxpayer has any income from self-employment. If the answer is "yes"
    then the taxpayer will be prompted to provide details of that income.
    If the answer is no, no further questions on self-employed income will
    be put. The FTT judge also refers to the fact that a summary sheet is
    provided for the taxpayer to check through.


28. At paragraph 20 the Judge made findings as to the 2010/11 tax return
    and at paragraph 21 makes findings in respect of the first appellant's
    explanation for the discrepancy. At paragraph 22 the Judge makes
    findings in respect of dishonesty. In doing so the Judge takes account
    of the fact that the first appellant made a voluntary declaration in
    respect of additional income to HMRC and takes into account his
    explanation for the initial under-declaration and the evidence of his
    neighbour who is said to have completed the tax return for him.


29. At paragraph 23 the FTT Judge makes findings about the 2012/13 tax
    return. At paragraph 24 the Judge deals with the first appellant's
    explanation for the under-declaration and at paragraph 25 the Judge
    makes her findings in respect of dishonesty. By way of introduction the
    Judge expressly gives credit for the fact that there was a voluntary
    declaration swiftly made to deal with the under-declaration.


30. Having dealt with dishonesty the Judge moves on at paragraph 26 to list
    specific factors including his established life in the United Kingdom
    which are to his credit. At paragraph 27 the Judge lists those factors,
    including the dishonesty she has found, which weigh against him. In our
    view the FTT Judge was here conducting the required balancing exercise.




31. At paragraph 28 the Judge turned to the Baljigari guidance. She makes 3
    points. First there is reliable evidence of his conduct, secondly his
    conduct was (as she has found) deliberate and dishonest and thirdly his
    presence on the United Kingdom is undesirable. It seems to us that the
    first 2 points cover the need to show "reliable evidence of ...
    sufficiently reprehensible conduct" in accordance with the Balijigari
    guidance. The third point is the outcome of the assessment or balancing
    exercise required. The factors taken into account are those set out at
    paragraphs 26 and 27.


32. At paragraphs 29 to 33 the Judge deals with procedural fairness and at
    paragraph 34 with proportionality asking herself if there are
    compelling reasons why leave should be granted.






    The grounds of appeal


33. The appellants rely on six grounds of appeal. In summary:

      a. Insufficient reasons are provided for the finding of dishonesty and
         the finding is irrational in that it takes no account of
         "motivation"
      b. The FTT Judge misunderstand Khan and failed to take account of the
         fact that the decision had in fact been overruled or disapproved of
         and failed to apply the correct burden and standard of proof
      c. The FTT Judge erred in her approach to the witness evidence of the
         appellant's neighbour
      d. The FTT Judge failed to consider "carelessness"
      e. The Judge failed to take account of the fact that HMRC had not
         issued a penalty and failed to take proper account of the
         appellant's accountant's evidence
      f. The FTT Judge failed to conduct the requisite balancing exercise.

34. We will deal with the grounds in the same order:

      a. The FTT Judge dealt carefully with the evidence before her. It is
         plain that she had in mind the swift correction of the 2012/13
         return. Bearing in mind the approach set out in Balajigari it seems
         to us that the FTT Judge explained her conclusions with appropriate
         care and there is no basis on which can be said that the conclusion
         was not open to her. The Court of Appeal in Balajigari were at
         pains to point out (para.37(1)) that there would generally be no
         need for the FTT to refer to the detail set out in Genting. In our
         view the FTT did not need to give specific consideration to
         motivation. The FTT correctly applied the relevant test and the
         approach to finding dishonesty as a matter of law cannot be
         faulted.
      b. It seems to us that the decision in Khan was largely approved by
         the Court of Appeal in Balajigari. Insofar as Khan addressed the
         standard of proof the Court of Appeal expressly endorsed the
         decision (see para.43). In our view it is plain that the FTT Judge
         properly applied the law and did not start from the assumption that
         a material discrepancy in earnings declarations gave rise to an
         assumption of dishonesty. Rather the FTT Judge carefully deals with
         the explanation for the discrepancy and makes findings of fact
         before going on to consider the question of dishonesty. There is no
         basis on which it can be said that that the FTT Judge (having
         referred to the decisions which deal with the burden of proof at
         para.11) then failed to approach the issue correctly. Again in our
         view the structure of the judgment makes it clear that the FTT
         Judge approached the matter correctly.
      c. There is nothing in this ground. The FTT Judge considered a witness
         statement prepared by the appellant's neighbour and was fully
         entitled (and indeed right) to accord the statement less weight
         than would have been the case if the witness had been tendered for
         cross-examination.
      d. There is nothing in this ground. The FTT Judge dealt with the
         evidence and clearly considered whether the appellant had made a
         "genuine mistake" in respect of each return (see para.22(c) and
         para.25(a)).
      e. The FTT Judge had evidence that no penalties were charged (see the
         appellant's witness statement at paragraph 9(c)(ii)) and at
         paragraph 16 of the decision makes it plain that she had taken the
         appellant's bundle (which included his witness statement) into
         account. The decision makes express reference to the absence of
         penalties at paragraph 18 where the FTT Judge notes the appellant's
         submission that this means HMRC accepted there had been a simple
         mistake. In our view the Judge clearly took the absence of a
         penalty into account. Further the FTT Judge referred to evidence
         from the appellant's accountant at paragraph 24(d) and (e). In the
         latter sub-paragraph the FTT Judge noted the accountant's
         explanation fell short of the "full and particularised explanation"
         generally required (see Balajigari para.106). The accountant's
         letter was in the appellant's bundle which the Judge confirmed she
         had taken into account.
      f. It is important to understand how the balancing exercise should be
         conducted. It is clear from Balajigari that the assessment follows
         on from any finding of dishonesty. In our view, the FTT Judge
         conducts the exercise at paragraphs 26 and 27 expressing her
         conclusion at paragraph 28(c). At paragraph 27 the Judge refers to
         her findings of dishonesty and refers to the exercise of "weighing"
         evidence against the background of those findings.

35. We therefore find that none of the grounds of appeal is made out. In
    granting permission to appeal, FTT Judge Osborne described the FTT
    Judge's decision as "careful". He carved out rom that description the
    potential failure to address carelessness. We have concluded (see
    appeal ground (d)) that the decision makes it plain that the FTT Judge
    considered the possibility of a genuine mistake. We do however agree
    that the FTT Judge's was careful and in our view carefully reasoned.


36. In our view the FTT Judge considered all of the evidence before her,
    including the oral evidence of the first appellant after cross
    examination. It seems to us that the FTT Judge's conclusions on
    dishonesty were essentially factual. The Judge applied the law
    correctly and was entitled to reach the factual findings she reached.
    For those reasons we dismiss the appeal.
