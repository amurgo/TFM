                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This determination refers to parties as they were in the  First-tier
       Tribunal.


    2. The SSHD appeals against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Quigley, allowing the appellant's appeal  against  refusal  of
       his application for leave to remain as the spouse of a UK citizen.

    3. Regarding the "partner 5 year route", the judge found at �32-34 that
       the appellant met the financial requirements of  the  rules  (having
       produced evidence  lacking  in  his  application)  and  the  English
       language requirements (having wrongly relied in his  application  on
       being a national of a majority English-speaking country,  but  being
       able to succeed on  this  point  by  his  academic  qualifications).
       Those findings overcame the respondent's points of refusal, and were
       not now challenged.  The appeal was rightly allowed under the rules.

    4. The judge made findings on insurmountable obstacles and  exceptional
       circumstances, and appears to have purported  to  allow  the  appeal
       also "outside" the rules under article 8.   Only  those  conclusions
       are attacked in the SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT.  While  they
       might all properly be contested, Mr Mullen fairly pointed  out  that
       they are also all beside the point.

    5. Mr Rea agreed that there was no need to consider these  matters,  as
       the appellant had all he could wish for in  the  successful  outcome
       under the rules, based on the findings at �32-34.


    6. There is no practical need to vary the decision  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, and it shall stand.
