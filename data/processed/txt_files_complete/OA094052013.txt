                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Raymond promulgated on 18 December 2013,  dismissing  the  Appellant's
      appeal against the Respondent's decision dated 15 March 2013 to refuse
      entry clearance as a spouse.

Background

   2. The Appellant is a national of India born on  6  August  1965.  On  18
      December 2012 the Appellant made an application for entry clearance to
      settle in the UK as the spouse of  a  British  citizen,  Mr  Jagminder
      Singh ('the sponsor'). The application was refused for reasons set out
      in a Notice of Immigration Decision dated 15 March 2013 with reference
      to paragraphs EC-P.1.1(d) and E-ECP.2.6, 2.10 and 3.1 of  Appendix  FM
      of the Immigration Rules.


   3. The Appellant appealed to  the  IAC.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  for  reasons  set  out   in   his
      determination.


   4. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Raymond on 18 December 2013.


Consideration

   5.  The  Respondent  had  not  been  satisfied   that   the   Appellant's
      relationship with the sponsor was a  genuine  and  subsisting  marital
      relationship or that they intended to live together permanently in the
      UK. This issue had been the subject of  a  previous  judicial  finding
      favourable to the Appellant in an earlier  appeal  promulgated  on  15
      August 2011, which Judge Raymond adopted following  the  reasoning  in
      Devasseelan [2002] UKIAT 00702: see determination at paragraphs 6-9.


   6. The outstanding issue under  the  Rules  was  therefore  that  of  the
      financial requirements.


   7. It seems to me manifest that there was no error under the Rules -  and
      indeed I do not understand the Appellant to pursue such an argument  -
      although criticism is made of the drafting of the Rules as  containing
      a 'lacuna' for those whose sponsors are paid in cash.  In  support  of
      the application reliance had been placed on the sponsor's income  from
      employment as a packer  with  Phoenix  Natural  that  fell  below  the
      �18,600 threshold under the Rules. Additional reliance was  placed  on
      income from a second employment with Quality Foods, but the  requisite
      supporting evidence was not supplied and so the Rules did  not  permit
      account to be taken of this claimed income.


   8. The challenge is in respect of Article 8 of the ECHR, with  particular
      reference to the decision in MM [2013] EWHC 1900  (Admin).  (The  High
      Court decision in MM has now been overturned by the Court  of  Appeal:
      see further below.)


   9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dealt only very briefly with  Article  8
      in a single sentence at the  conclusion  of  the  determination  -  "I
      further find that the Article 8 is not engaged as there is no obstacle
      to the couple residing in the UK if the maintenance threshold is  met,
      and in the interim continuing their family contact in India"- and  did
      not  consider  the  submissions  that  I  accept  were  made  on   the
      Appellant's behalf with reference to MM.


  10. The failure to engage with pertinent submissions and the case law that
      was applicable at the time amounts to an error of law.


  11. In considering the interconnected issues of setting aside and remaking
      the decision I note the following matters.

(i) The High Court decision  in  MM  might  have  potentially  assisted  the
      Appellant in two ways: the suggestion of a minimum income  requirement
      of �13,500 would be  met  from  the  sponsor's  principal  employment;
      "stringent new  modes  of  proof"  (paragraph  107(viii))  potentially
      constituted an intrusive interference.  I  note,  however,  that  this
      latter point was  not  carried  forward  into  the  five  features  at
      paragraph 124 of MM.

(ii) The Appellant's principal case was not that her sponsor  did  not  earn
      sufficient to meet the  requirements  of  the  Rules.  This  was  not,
      therefore, strictly an MM type case. The issue,  rather,  was  whether
      the income was indeed as claimed, and had been shown to be so.

(iii) Although the First-tier Tribunal Judge did  not  precisely  articulate
      the matter in this way, it seems to me clear that the thrust  of  what
      is said at paragraph 19 of the determination is  in  effect,  that  in
      circumstances where considerable doubts were engendered by the history
      of applications and the findings in earlier appeals, it was  necessary
      to produce independent evidence of actual payment of salary  from  the
      employment with Quality Foods - "such as would  be  provided  by  bank
      statements"- beyond printed wage slips and notification to HMRC of the
      claimed income. This is the more so in circumstances where there is  a
      further complication arising from an apparent confusion  over  use  of
      the sponsor's National Insurance number: see, for example, wage  slips
      for Phoenix Natural at page 23 et seq of the Appellant's bundle before
      the First-tier Tribunal, and the P60 for the year to 5 April 2012  for
      Quality Foods (page 54). There is no evidence or  suggestion  that  it
      would present the sponsor with any difficulty if he were to  pay  into
      his bank account any wages received in cash, and similarly there is no
      evidence that it would present his employer  -  who  was  prepared  to
      attend an earlier appeal to  give  evidence  in  support  -  with  any
      difficulty to pay the sponsor's wages directly into his account.

(iv) In all of the circumstances in my judgement it is clear that the First-
      tier Tribunal Judge was not satisfied in respect of the claimed income
      from employment at Quality Foods, notwithstanding that the Judge  took
      into account a wider range of evidence than  was  submitted  with  the
      application,  and  undertook  an   assessment   of   facts   seemingly
      unconstrained by the particular requirements of the Rules.  In  short,
      the Judge did not confine his assessment to the "stringent  new  modes
      of proof", but was still not  satisfied  in  respect  of  the  claimed
      income. To this extent  I  find  nothing  in  paragraph  107(viii)  or
      elsewhere in MM avails the Appellant under Article  8  in  respect  of
      claimed income from his second job.

(v) As regards reliance upon paragraph 124 in MM, it is to be noted that  in
      paragraph 123 the High Court considered that a  "combination  of  more
      than one" of the five features in paragraph 124 was required  for  the
      Rules to be "so  onerous  in  effect  as  to  be  an  unjustified  and
      disproportionate interference with a  genuine  spousal  relationship".
      Whilst the first of the five features  -  the  actual  minimum  income
      level - applies in the instant case with reference to the  Appellant's
      accepted income from his primary job, no reliance has been  placed  in
      respect of any of the other four features.  In  such  circumstances  I
      find that this aspect of MM could not have availed the  Appellant  had
      it been considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

(vi)  No other arguments were raised in respect of  Article  8,  other  than
      those engendered in the decision in MM.


  12. I have considered the High Court decision in MM above because  at  the
      time of the hearing before me the judgement in the Court of Appeal had
      not been made. The effect of that judgement is  now  to  overturn  the
      decision of the  High  Court  in  MM.  Necessarily  this  defeats  the
      Appellant's continuing reliance upon the High Court decision. Further,
      there is no point in reconvening the hearing to  hear  submissions  in
      light of the Court of Appeal decision because it is binding  upon  the
      Tribunal. In any  event,  for  the  reasons  outlined  above,  I  have
      concluded that I would not  have  reached  a  finding  in  the  appeal
      favourable to the Appellant if I  were  remaking  the  decision,  even
      applying the guidance and principles of the High Court decision in MM.


  13. In all such circumstances it seems to  me  that,  notwithstanding  the
      First-tier Tribunal Judge's failure to  engage  with  the  Appellant's
      submissions in respect of MM, this did not then, and cannot now,  make
      any material difference to the outcome, and accordingly I do  not  set
      aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. Both the decision under
      the Rules, and in respect of Article  8  -  essentially  that  it  was
      entirely proportionate to expect the Appellant and sponsor to  provide
      the prescribed evidence to demonstrate the maintenance  threshold  was
      met - stand.


Decision

  14. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge contained  an  error  of
      law, but is not set aside.


  15. The appeal is dismissed.
