Representation:

For the appellants:    Mr G Davison, instructed by YY
For the respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants'  appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Moore  promulgated  21.4.15,  dismissing  their  linked
    appeals against the decision of  the  respondent,  DATED  20.11.13,  to
    refuse entry clearance  to  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  partner  and
    dependent child pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 13.4.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth refused permission to appeal  on
    4.11.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce granted permission  to  appeal  on
    10.1.16

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 1.3.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out below, I found such error of law in the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require  the  decision
    of Judge Moore to be set aside and remade on the basis of the  existing
    evidence and unchallenged factual findings of the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. The appellants applied for entry clearance as respectively  spouse  and
    child of their sponsoring husband in  the  UK.  The  applications  were
    refused by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  because  of  alleged  false
    representation as to the  sponsor's  claimed  employment  with  Skyways
    Shopfitters Ltd, following checks with HMRC, and secondly, because  the
    Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that the first appellant  and
    the sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting relationship.

 6. After considering the evidence  Judge  Moore  was  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor had been and continued to be employed as claimed and  that  the
    wage slips provided were genuine and reliable. However, Judge Moore was
    not satisfied that the relationship between  the  first  appellant  and
    sponsor was genuine and subsisting, for the reasons set out between �21
    and �24 of the decision. In essence, the judge relied on the absence of
    evidence of telephone calls between 2001 and 2010. The sponsor made  no
    visit to India  following  marriage  in  1998  until  2010.  The  judge
    concluded that there was no meaningful or genuine contact between them.



 7. In summary the grounds of application for permission to  appeal  assert
    in general terms that the First-tier Tribunal erred in its approach  to
    the evidence of the claimed relationship  between  first  appellant  in
    India and sponsor in the UK.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Bruce found arguable  error  in
    the judge's approach to the issue of telephone  contact,  referring  to
    Goudey (subsisting marriage - evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041  (IAC),
    and noting that the judge found  there  had  been  no  attempt  by  the
    appellants to deceive, one of  the  reasons  relied  on  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer in doubting the genuineness of the relationship.

 9. I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal erred in  its  approach  to
    the evidence and in particular that the judge lost sight  of  the  fact
    that the genuineness of the relationship was to be assessed as  at  the
    date of the refusal decision in November 2013. At �23 of  the  decision
    Judge Moore stated that it would be fair to point out that since  2010,
    "and more recently  in  the  last  couple  of  years  the  contact  and
    communications between the appellant and sponsor have increased.  I  am
    however  satisfied  that  such  an  increase  in  contact  between  the
    appellant and sponsor cannot be viewed in isolation, and must be put in
    context, that is to say  that  the  appellant  and  sponsor  have  been
    married for sixteen years, and that up until 2010 there was  little  or
    no contact such as to reflect a subsisting relationship."

10. The judge went on at �24 to accept that since 2010 there  have  been  a
    number of money transfer payments by the sponsor to the appellants  and
    that he has made two visits to stay with his wife and family  in  India
    for periods of two and three months  respectively.  As  they  were  not
    produced  in  evidence,  the  judge  was  unable  to  take  a  view  of
    photographs relied on by the Entry  Clearance  Officer  as  having  the
    appearance of being staged.

11. I find that the judge was overly influenced by the absence of  evidence
    of contact between the appellants and the sponsor in the period between
    marriage and 2010, so as to discount what can only be considered to  be
    substantial  evidence  of  a  subsisting  relationship  post  2009  and
    continuing to the present day, including telephone contact,  visits  to
    India and money transfers. It is important  to  note  that  absence  of
    evidence of contact up to 2009 does not mean that  there  was  no  such
    contact. The sponsor explained that he did not return to his  wife  and
    family because he did not  obtain  indefinite  leave  to  remain  until
    31.12.09. Thereafter, as the judge accepted at �22,  he  made  a  visit
    within months in 2010 and a further visit in 2011.

12. Whilst the judge was entitled to consider the evidence in the round  as
    a whole and reach conclusions as to the nature of the  relationship,  I
    find that the judge lost sight of the fact that at  the  relevant  date
    there was good evidence that  the  relationship  was  still  alive  and
    genuine. In reality, the  period  between  2001  and  2009/10  was  not
    determinative  to  the  issue  as  to  whether  the  relationship   was
    subsisting in 2013. I further find that there  is  insufficient  reason
    demonstrated in the decision to discount  or  ignore  the  more  recent
    evidence. All the judge says about that is  it  has  to  be  placed  in
    context of the absence of  evidence  during  the  earlier  period.  The
    reverse should also be true, but that does not appear to have been  the
    judge's  approach.  Further,  it  does  not  follow  that  because  the
    relationship was perhaps dormant before 2010, it cannot be genuine  and
    subsisting now or in 2013. The  decision  is  therefore  an  unbalanced
    assessment of the evidence and thus amounts to an error of law and must
    be set aside and remade.

13. In remaking the decision I preserve  the  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in relation to employment of the sponsor. On the  evidence  as
    was available to the  First-tier  Tribunal  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellants  have  discharged  the  burden  of  proof,  the  balance  of
    probabilities, that the relationship between the  first  appellant  and
    the sponsor is genuine and subsisting as at the  date  of  the  refusal
    decision in 2013. There is ample  evidence  of  contact  including  two
    visits to them in India, telephone contact, and  money  transfers.  The
    sponsor has produced further evidence of further visits to  his  family
    in India and further evidence of contact. Whilst  it  is  post-decision
    evidence, it is arguable that  it  is  admissible  to  demonstrate  the
    nature of the relationship as at the date of refusal in  2013.  Whether
    with  or  without  this  further  evidence  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    appellants have discharged the requirements of Appendix FM and thus the
    appeal should be allowed, for the reasons set out above.

Conclusions:

14. I find that the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did
    involve the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision
    should be set aside and remade by allowing the appeals.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeals  by  allowing  the
                    appeal of each appellant.

Consequential Directions

15. Forthwith on receipt of this decision the respondent shall issue  entry
    clearance   [provided  the  respondent  is  satisfied  there   are   no
    circumstances arising after  the  date  of  this  determination  /  the
    decision under appeal which make it necessary to refuse to do so].

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make a whole fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been allowed.
