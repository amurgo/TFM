Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Westmaas, instructed by Singhania & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants are nationals of  India,  wife  and  husband  and  their
    daughter  respectively.   They  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against decisions of the respondent on 10 September 2013 refusing  them
    further leave and deciding to make removal directions under  s.  47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 (as amended).    Judge
    Mathews dismissed their appeals.  The appellants applied to the  First-
    tier Tribunal for permission  to  appeal  against  that  decision,  and
    permission was granted by Judge Osborne.  Amongst the reasons given  by
    Judge Osborne for her  decision  were  that  the  Judge  erred  in  not
    applying a "high standard of proof" in the circumstances  of  the  case
    before him.  Before us it was accepted that the  reference  to  such  a
    standard was a mistake of law by Judge Osborne.  Nevertheless, in  view
    of the grant of permission, and particularly because  it  raised  other
    issues, the matter comes before us.

 2. The first appellant (whom we shall call "the appellant")  came  to  the
    United Kingdom in 2007 as a working  holiday-maker.   She  was  granted
    further leave as a highly skilled migrant, expiring on 25  March  2010.
    She had further leave as a highly skilled migrant until 25 March  2013.
    The application resulting in the present decision was made on 12  March
    2013, that is to say whilst the appellant had leave.  The  reasons  for
    the refusal of the  application  refer  to  the  circumstances  of  the
    appellant's previous application, as follows:

         "On 12 February 2010 Migration Gurus applied  on  your  behalf  for
         leave to remain as a Tier  1  (General)  Migrant.   They  submitted
         documents to corroborate your previous claimed earnings  from  your
         (self-employment) with Prit Services Ltd  and  BMP  Consultant  Ltd
         providing accountants' letters and bank statements  from  01  April
         2009 until 01 January 2010.  The Secretary of  State  is  satisfied
         that the documents submitted in relation to these employments  were
         counterfeit as  made  clear  in  the  witness  statements  made  by
         Detective Constable Laura Curry and Sonal Rajshakha.

         It is considered that the Secretary of State is satisfied that  you
         have submitted false representations within your visa  applications
         including gaining extensions of  leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom.  As false representation have been  made  in  relation  to
         your previous application your application for indefinite leave  to
         remain  has  been  refused  under  Paragraph   322(1A)   of   HC395
         immigration rules which comes under General Grounds for Refusal. "

 3. The judge had before him the reports to which reference is made in that
    decision, to which we shall refer in more  detail  shortly.   He  noted
    that the previous application did indeed rely on employment  with  Prit
    Services Ltd and BMP Consultants, or at any rate an income  from  those
    firms.  The evidence produced by the Secretary  of  State  appeared  to
    show that Prit Services Ltd and BMP Consultants were amongst  at  least
    fifteen sham companies operated by Migration Gurus with the purpose  of
    creating paperwork that could be used to provide evidence of employment
    and work that did not really exist.  He noted also that the appellant's
    position was that she had not engaged in any deception:

         "18. I note that the appellant  does  not  deny  that  she  was  in
         contact with [Migration Gurus].  She  maintains  however  that  her
         employment by Prit Services Limited and BMP Consultants was genuine
         and represented online data entry.  In her oral  evidence  she  was
         able to give little significant  detail  of  the  data  entered  or
         computer program used.  She could produce no record of her  own  of
         such employment.  No  emails  from  her  claimed  online  employer,
         despite that being her method of communication with them."

 4. Looking at the evidence as  a  whole,  the  judge  concluded  that  the
    appellant had not worked in the manner she claimed; the  jobs  had  not
    existed, and that was the reason that she was unable to give details of
    them.  He found also as a fact that when her previous  application  for
    leave to remain was made,  she  was  aware  that  the  documents  being
    submitted, relating to her employment, contained  falsehoods  and  that
    she "knowingly made a fraudulent application in that it relied on false
    employment details".

 5. The judge went on to deal with the argument made on her behalf that she
    relied  on  different  employment   (and   indeed,   apparently,   real
    employment) for the later application.  His conclusion was as follows:

         "21. ... Paragraph 322 (1A), relied upon by the respondent allows a
         refusal where, amongst other features, false information  has  been
         submitted, or material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed.   In  my
         judgement the fact that the first appellant knew that her  previous
         immigration status had been obtained by fraudulent assertions as to
         her employment, employment that had not occurred and therefore  she
         knew to have  been  false,  was  and  remains  a  highly  pertinent
         material fact that she elected not to disclose.  Indeed  she  chose
         not to address that employment in her present witness statement,  a
         matter that I also found to be indicative of her knowledge of  that
         purported employment was fraudulent.

         22. I find that the appellant was fundamentally  dishonest  in  her
         previous application and  failed  to  disclose  that  fact  in  the
         present application.  In my judgement paragraph  322  is  correctly
         and properly invoked and relied  upon  by  the  respondent  in  the
         present case. "

 6. The judge went on to deal with issues of article 8 and the interests of
    Chelsi, and concluded that there was no reason why the appellants, as a
    family, should not be removed to India.

 7. The grounds of appeal are  rather  curiously  arranged.   Ignoring  the
    issue about the burden of proof, they may be stated as follows.  First,
    the appellant met the requirements of the  rules  in  relation  to  her
    current application.  Secondly, so far as the allegation  of  falsehood
    is concerned, both the Secretary of State and  the  judge  applied  the
    wrong provision of the rules:  paragraph 322(1A) relates to the current
    application; if there is an issue about  a  previous  application,  the
    appropriate rule is in paragraph 322(2).   Thirdly,  the  Secretary  of
    State did not adduce in evidence any  document  alleged  to  be  false.
    Fourthly, the appellant has always abided by the law.  The focus of  Mr
    Westmaas' submissions before us  was  on  the  evidence  going  to  the
    appellant's alleged misconduct.

 8. The principal  evidence  upon  which  the  Secretary  of  State  relied
    consisted of the reports to which  we  have  referred.   Those  reports
    relate to the enterprise that operated under  the  name  of  "Migration
    Gurus".  Sonal Rajshakha is a financial investigator, whose  report  is
    dated 1 November 2011.  He had examined the records of Migration  Gurus
    and fifteen associated companies, amongst which  were  BMP  Consultants
    and Prit Services Ltd.  He concluded that none of the  businesses  were
    genuine operating businesses, but instead were instruments set  up  for
    the sole purpose of providing the impression of a salary for clients of
    Migration Gurus.  The client would pay a sum of money into one  of  the
    companies, it would be transferred to and  from  various  company  bank
    accounts, and it would then be paid by one  of  the  companies  to  the
    client, purportedly as a salary.  The money could then be used again in
    the same way.  As the expert reported, "none of the  fifteen  companies
    appear to engage in any actual business  activity  of  any  kind.   The
    usual payments one would expect  to  see  for  a  legitimate  operating
    business, such as payments for  utilities  bills,  taxation,  invoices,
    office supplies, transport, expenses, overheads, running  costs,  stock
    and lease/rental/mortgage payments  for  commercial  premises  are  not
    apparent within the fifteen companies' bank accounts".   He  also  said
    that:

         "The fifteen companies do not appear to operate as fifteen separate
         companies.  In practice, they  appear  to  operate  as  one  single
         company,  balancing  and  reconciling   one   another's   financial
         accounts.  The credits and debits for the majority of  the  fifteen
         companies' bank accounts almost  do  or,  indeed  do,  balance  one
         another out.  There is no apparent generation  of  profit  nor  the
         sustenance of loss, as one would expect to see from  time  to  time
         within a legitimate business account.  The purpose of a network  of
         companies as opposed to a single company in this case,  appears  to
         be an attempt to obscure the patterns of financial  activity  under
         which the scheme operates to disguise its source(s) of cash,  which
         is/are MG clients paying  themselves  their  own  fake  'salaries'.
         Moreover, every single one of the fifteen companies' bank  accounts
         is  held  with  HSBC  Bank  plc.   This  is  either  a   remarkable
         coincidence or more likely  -  deliberate,  for  ease  of  transfer
         between the fifteen companies' bank accounts. ...

         A figure of  only  �232,620.10  has  been  circulating  around  the
         fifteen companies' bank accounts for a period of greater  than  two
         years between 31 March 2008 and 15  August  2010.   This  does  not
         appear to be a particularly high figure for fifteen  companies  and
         amounts to less than �7,000 per annum per company."

 9. The statement, and DC Laura  Curry's  statement,  also  deal  with  the
    investigation into the activities of Vijay Sorthia and  his  wife,  who
    operated Migration Gurus together; over �332,000 was found in  cash  in
    their bedroom.  It is also not quite right  to  say,  as  was  said  on
    behalf of the appellant, that there is no evidence of  any  convictions
    arising out of these investigations; as  the  statements  record,  nine
    directors of the companies and  six  beneficiaries  of  the  Migrations
    Gurus scheme had already pleaded guilty to offences of obtaining  leave
    by deception and/or money laundering.

10. As Mr Westmaas pointed out in his submissions to  us,  the  appellant's
    name does not appear  in  the  documentation;  the  financial  expert's
    conclusions were based on an assessment of about 84% of the  companies'
    financial transactions, not 100%, and there  was  up-to-date  evidence.
    It seems to us that that is beside the point.  The evidence before  the
    judge was amply sufficient to enable him to reach the  conclusion  that
    the companies for which the appellant had  claimed  to  work  were  not
    genuine companies at all and had no work  to  do.   The  appellant  was
    given an opportunity to describe her work, in her oral evidence  before
    the judge, and gave an explanation which was so lacking in detail  that
    he did not accept it as a description of how  her  working  hours  were
    spent.

11. The judge's conclusion was that the appellant had  not  undertaken  the
    work that she had claimed to  have  undertaken.   That  conclusion  was
    based firmly on the evidence and, in our judgment, shows  no  error  of
    law.  The claim of paid employment upon  which  she  had  obtained  her
    previous grant of leave was false.

12. Mr Westmaas was right in drawing the distinction between sub-paras (1A)
    and (2) of Paragraph 322.  But the judge did not make  the  error  upon
    which Mr Westmaas relies.  As we have indicated, the judge very clearly
    found that the failure in  the  present  application  to  disclose  the
    previous leave was obtained by a  falsehood  was  non-disclosure  of  a
    material fact within the meaning of sub-para (1A).  Mr Westmaas did not
    in his oral submissions make any suggestion  that  the  judge  was  not
    entitled to reason in that manner.  In the circumstances,  refusal  was
    mandatory.   The  applicant's  previous  (alleged)  good  conduct   was
    irrelevant.  No arguments were raised before  us  in  relation  to  the
    judge's conclusions on article 8 or s.55, with which in  any  event  we
    agree entirely.  The applications and appeals of the second  and  third
    appellant depend entirely on those of the  appellant.   We  affirm  the
    dismissal of all three appeals.
