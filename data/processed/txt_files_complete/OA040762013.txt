Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Sarwar instructed by Lexton Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, who is a citizen of Pakistan,  appeals  with  permission
    against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Graham  to
    dismiss his appeal against refusal of entry clearance as the husband of
    the Sponsor, Saqba Shafiq, who is a British citizen.  The  judge  found
    in her determination that the Appellant had not established that he was
    in a subsisting  marriage  in  which  both  parties  intended  to  live
    together permanently as spouses nor that it had  been  shown  that  the
    Appellant could be adequately maintained.  The  date  of  the  original
    decision under appeal made by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  14th
    December 2012 but the application was made prior to the changes to  the
    Immigration Rules introduced on 9th July 2012.

 2. At the hearing Mr Sarwar relied on the grounds of application.  He said
    that the  judge  had  erred  in  her  approach  to  assessment  of  the
    subsistence of the relationship.  She had noted that  the  Sponsor  had
    travelled to Pakistan on 30th January 2012, the couple had  married  on
    4th February and the Sponsor had returned on 7th February,  only  three
    days after the ceremony. However he submitted that the judge had failed
    to take account of the Sponsor's evidence that  her  early  return  had
    been due to illness and the invoice for the air ticket showed that  the
    intended date of  return  had  been  11th February.   There  was  also
    evidence before the judge that the Sponsor had  visited  again  between
    5th and 18th October 2013, almost two weeks, but the judge  had  failed
    to attach weight to that visit.  The couple were  clearly  married  and
    the Sponsor had visited again a year later.  They had been in touch  by
    telephone and he referred to  communication  by  telephone  by  prepaid
    cards as well as by Lycamobile and iCard Mobile.  Although  some  calls
    were short, some were more substantial and he pointed  to  calls  which
    had lasted several minutes and in some cases more.  The fact that  some
    calls might be short did not necessarily mean  that  was  the  intended
    duration and they might have been discontinued through no fault of  the
    parties.  The telephone calls were not insignificant and many were over
    five minutes.  He said it was clearly apparent that the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor kept in contact whilst apart.  The judge had not  given  proper
    weight to these calls and had concentrated only on the short calls.

 3. He continued that also in the Respondent's bundle were copies of an Eid
    card and a New Year card.  The originals were with the ECO and yet  the
    judge had ignored the impact of  these.   There  was  evidence  of  the
    Sponsor staying after the marriage.   He  said  this  was  evidence  of
    cohabitation and of further cohabitation  when  she  returned  in  2013
    (evidenced by entries in her passport) and there were  two  photographs
    of the Appellant and Sponsor together.   The  judge  appeared  to  have
    expected many photographs to have been produced but there were cultural
    issues.  The Sponsor was from a conservative family, her  father  being
    an imam, and they could not have stood so close together had  they  not
    been married.  It was apparent  from  the  application  form  that  the
    Appellant was proposing to live at the Sponsor's address.  He said  the
    totality of the evidence showed that there was a genuine  relationship.
    He  relied  upon  the  reported  determinations  of  GA   ("subsisting"
    marriage) Ghana* [2006] UKAIT 00046 and Goudey (subsisting  marriage  -
    evidence) Sudan [2012] UKUT 00041 (IAC).

 4. With regard to employment, the judge had not accepted that the  Sponsor
    was employed as claimed because she did not find that the Sponsor could
    have obtained her degree without attending tutorials but he said all of
    the course material was available on line.  She had attended university
    and obtained a first class degree but to attend full-time did not  mean
    9am till 5pm five days per week; it could be  anything  between  eleven
    and twenty hours a week.  It did not imply that the Sponsor  could  not
    do part-time work.  He said that the judge failed to  take  account  of
    the fact that the work was 27 hours per week.  If she was also studying
    at university for fifteen hours that would still only be 42  hours  per
    week in total, including her work, and it was  plausible  and  possible
    that she would do so.  He  continued  that  the  judge  had  not  taken
    account of the best material evidence which  was  the  letter  from  HM
    Revenue & Customs.  The Sponsor had produced copy wage  slips  and  her
    bank account which showed payments corresponding to the wage slips  and
    there had also been produced a P60 for the year 2012/2013 and a  letter
    from the employer's accountant.  Taking the totality of  that  evidence
    he submitted that the judge's findings were irrational and perverse.

 5. Finally he said that the judge had  not  considered  Article  8  rights
    although he accepted that if the judge had made a  finding  that  there
    was no live relationship then Article 8 would not be relevant.

 6. In response Mr Mills said that the judge had not ignored the  evidence.
    She was conscious of the two periods of cohabitation but they were very
    brief.  The Sponsor had returned to this country three days  after  the
    wedding and had waited twenty months before going  to  Pakistan  again,
    when she had only stayed another thirteen days.  They  had  spent  less
    than three weeks together, that was three weeks in a two year  marriage
    and there had been no real explanation why they had not spent more time
    together.

 7. With regard to the telephone records he said that the judge  was  quite
    right; the majority of those calls were very short.   There  were  some
    longer ones but there were only a dozen or so.  She had been correct in
    her assessment.  The Appellant's representative today had  referred  to
    various calls but there had been no bundle before the First-tier  Judge
    with a schedule of relevant calls.  The judge had been entitled to take
    the view she did of the evidence.  The judge had noted that  there  was
    no evidence for instance by way of email or text  and  there  had  only
    been two cards.  The judge had taken account of the evidence and  found
    that that it did not demonstrate a subsisting relationship.   The  case
    of Goudey only established that phone cards were capable  of  affording
    weight but the judge found countervailing  factors,  notably  that  the
    Sponsor had left three days after the wedding and had only  stayed  for
    less than two weeks on the next occasion.  He said that  the  challenge
    now mounted was simply a disagreement with the  findings.  The  judge's
    findings were not irrational and were reasoned.

 8. With regard  to  maintenance,  that  would  only  be  material  if  the
    relationship finding was  set  aside.   The  judge  did  not  find  the
    evidence submitted reliable.  The burden was upon the  Appellant.   She
    gave reasons for doubting that evidence.  The Sponsor was studying  for
    a first class university degree  and  yet  it  was  said  she  had  not
    attended lectures or tutorials.  There was no supporting evidence  from
    the university.  It was very hard to believe that she could  have  been
    such a successful student if she was not attending university and  that
    if she were doing that that she could have held down what was in effect
    a full-time job.  The letter from HMRC was reliant  on  documents  from
    the employer and that letter gave no details of pay or  tax.   The  P60
    form submitted showed a total income of ï¿½7,294 which was below the  tax
    threshold.  The employment was by an interested relative.  He said that
    the findings were well reasoned and not irrational.

 9. Finally Mr Sarwar said  that  the  Appellant  lived  in  a  village  in
    Pakistan and emails were probably not a practical possibility  but  the
    evidence showed cohabitation.  With regard to employment, all employers
    self-declared and the Sponsor had only been working for  27  hours  for
    each week.  The judge had reached an unjustified conclusion.  The  wage
    slips were consistent with the money going into the Sponsor's account.

10. I have to decide not whether I would have decided this  appeal  in  the
    same way as the judge but whether she has made a material error of law.
     The Sponsor gave oral evidence before the judge.  At the relevant time
    she was studying law at the University of Wolverhampton and was awarded
    a first class degree in that subject  following  that  study,  in  July
    2013, shortly after the application was submitted.  She claimed to have
    been working at the time for 27 hours per  week  with  Tividale  Foods,
    which was owned by a relative of her father, and  although  she  always
    worked the same hours she worked them at flexible times.

11. The judge's findings in this regard are set out at paragraphs 20 to  23
    of the determination.  The judge did not  find  it  credible  that  the
    Sponsor would  be  able  to  graduate  from  a  degree  course  without
    attending lectures or tutorials in the final two years of  the  course.
    The Sponsor  had  agreed  that  it  was  the  policy  of  Wolverhampton
    University to keep a record of  student  attendance  and  that  such  a
    record was kept but did not pursue students with  poor  attendance  but
    only in the final year.  The judge did not find it plausible or  likely
    that  given  the  university's  policy  to  keep  records  of   student
    attendance and the fact that a register of students attending  lectures
    was kept that the university would then take no action in  relation  to
    persistent non-attendance.  The records were likely to be important for
    health and safety amongst other reasons.  The Sponsor had said that  in
    the second and third year of the degree course she  had  only  attended
    the first lecture of each topic and then had studied at  home  and  had
    not attended tutorials for the last two years of  her  course  yet  she
    obtained a first class degree.  The judge found it  extremely  unlikely
    that she would have been able to gain  a  first  class  honours  degree
    without attending the lectures or tutorials and  the  Sponsor  had  not
    explained how she would have been able  to  know  when  to  attend  the
    lectures which she did go to.  The judge came to  the  conclusion  that
    she was satisfied that the Appellant must have been a regular  attender
    at the university and that led her to doubt her account  that  she  was
    able to work  for  Tividale  Foods  for  the  time  claimed.   She  had
    considered the reliability of the documents submitted in support of the
    employment but looking at the matter in the round and bearing  in  mind
    these factors and that the employers were relatives of her  father  and
    therefore relations of the Appellant as well and  might  well  wish  to
    assist in entry clearance, she did not find the evidence reliable.

12. The judge was  clearly  aware  of  the  documentation  which  had  been
    submitted, in the nature of her payslips with corresponding entries  in
    the bank account and the letters from HMRC and  from  the  accountants.
    These were contained in the two bundles of papers before her which  she
    set out at paragraph 6 of the determination that  she  had  considered.
    The judge gave sufficient reasons for her finding in that the Appellant
    is able to ascertain why she found against him in this respect and  she
    also explained how she had reached those  conclusions.   Another  judge
    might have reached a different conclusion but the reasons that she gave
    were adequate and  were  open  to  her.   They  were  not  perverse  or
    irrational.  No material error is disclosed.

13.  With  regard  to  the  relationship,  the  judge  was  faced  with   a
    considerable list of telephone calls by various  means  and  copies  of
    telephone call cards.  There does not appear to have  been  a  schedule
    provided of  what  were  said  to  be  the  relevant  telephone  calls.
    Nonetheless she was  factually  correct  in  stating,  as  she  did  at
    paragraph 13 of her determination, that the log showed a  large  number
    of calls  being  made  from  the  Sponsor's  telephone  number  to  the
    Appellant's telephone number of short duration.  She was aware that  it
    was an arranged marriage and that the couple were first  cousins.   She
    noted that the Sponsor had left Pakistan three days after  the  wedding
    ceremony although the return flight had been booked for a little later.
     The Sponsor had said that she had become ill but  there  had  been  no
    medical evidence produced and the judge found it surprising that if the
    Sponsor was ill as claimed that she would have been able  to  undertake
    the long flight from Pakistan to the United Kingdom.  There was  little
    by way of correspondence.  The judge  referred  to  the  Eid  card  and
    another card and she said that there were partial  photocopies  in  the
    bundle.  She did  not  decline  to  attach  evidential  weight  to  the
    documents because the originals were not produced but because  she  had
    no information as to when the documents had been sent.   She  commented
    on the lack of communication by means other than  telephone  and  again
    that the majority of the calls were of extremely short  duration.   She
    noted the visit twenty months after the marriage  but  noted  that  the
    Sponsor had not explained why she  did  not  accompany  her  father  to
    Pakistan in July 2013 when he visited.  Taking all the factors together
    she was not satisfied that it had been established  that  the  marriage
    was subsisting.

14. As was pointed out at  the  hearing,  Goudey  merely  establishes  that
    telephone calls may constitute evidence of contact.  Judge Graham  gave
    other reasons for  doubting  the  relationship  and  the  existence  of
    telephone records was  far  from  being  conclusive.   Once  again  her
    findings allowed the Appellant to know why he had not succeeded in this
    respect and were reasoned.  The judge had  heard  oral  evidence.   She
    stated that she had considered the evidence in the round.  In  VW  (Sri
    Lanka) v SSHD Lord Justice McCombe (at paragraph 9  of  that  judgment)
    endorsed the comments of Lord Hoffmann in  Biogen  Inc.  v  Medeva  Ltd
    that:

         "The need for appellate caution  in  reversing  the  trial  judge's
         evaluation of the facts is based upon much more solid grounds  than
         professional courtesy.  It is because specific  findings  of  fact,
         even by the most meticulous judge,  are  inherently  an  incomplete
         statement of the impression which was made upon him by the  primary
         evidence.  His  expressed  findings  are  always  surrounded  by  a
         penumbra of imprecision as  to  emphasis,  relative  weight,  minor
         qualification and nuance ... of which  time  and  language  do  not
         permit exact expression, but which may play an  important  part  in
         the judge's overall evaluation."

15. It is trite law that matters of weight are for the judge  as  has  been
    made clear on numerous occasions, in particular by the Court of  Appeal
    in SS (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 155.

16. Having considered the determination, the application  and  grounds  and
    the submissions made I have come to the conclusion  that  the  findings
    made were open to Judge Graham and that no material error on a point of
    law has been made out.  Given the judge's findings, Article 8 was not a
    relevant factor.

Decision

The original determination did not contain a material error on  a  point  of
law and the decision that the appeal be dismissed therefore stands.
