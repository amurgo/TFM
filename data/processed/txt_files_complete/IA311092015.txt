                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a  decision  of
        First-tier Tribunal Judge Thomas ('the Judge')  promulgated  on  30
        March 2016 in which the Judge allowed the  appeal  to  the  limited
        extent that  the  Secretary  State  should  consider  a  policy  of
        fairness in line with the Judge's findings at [7] of the decision.
     2. This matter was originally listed for hearing before  Deputy  Upper
        Tribunal Judge Dr Storey on 21 February 2017 but could not  proceed
        as the applicant claimed he was unable to attend  as  he  had  been
        involved in an accident. The matter  was  therefore  re-listed  for
        hearing today. The appellant's case was called on by  the  Tribunal
        Clerk at the beginning of the day but  there  was  no  response  or
        attendance. The matter was therefore put back with a further  check
        being made at the end of the  morning  list,  12:45,  with,  again,
        there being no attendance by the appellant. The case was listed for
        hearing at 10 AM. The decision was reserved.
     3. The Upper Tribunal received a fax at 13:22 containing  a  Statement
        of Fitness for Work issued for the purposes of Statutory Sick  Pay,
        dated 10 May 2017, and a copy of a prescription issued on the  same
        date for two prescribed medications,  Naproxen  which  is  used  to
        treat  pain  or  inflammation  and  Lansoprazole,  a   prescriptive
        antacid.
     4. Other than informing the Tribunal that on 10 May 2017 the applicant
        was fit enough to travel to his doctors to obtain  a  Statement  of
        Fitness for Work indicating he is not fit for  work,  there  is  no
        indication why the Tribunal has been provided with these documents.
        They do not, for example,  explain  why  the  appellant  failed  to
        attend his hearing especially as it appears he was able  to  travel
        the 1 � miles from his home address to his GP surgery which is only
        slightly shorter than the 2 � miles between  the  appellant's  home
        address and the  Hearing  Centre.  Or  why  what  is  described  as
        'Muskeletol pain' prevented him attending to give evidence.
     5. Notwithstanding the indication of  the  appellant  suffering  pain,
        there is no indication that he was unable to  attend  the  hearing.
        There is no medical evidence to support such a conclusion.
     6. The decision had been reserved prior to the receipt of the  medical
        documents  and  their  subsequent  receipt  does  not  alter   this
        position.  The  question  is  whether  these  documents  provide  a
        satisfactory explanation for the  appellant's  failure  to  attend,
        which they do  not,  and  whether  fairness  requires  a  different
        decision being made and the matter being relisted to a future date,
        which it does not. Both parties received  a  fair  hearing  of  the
        application notwithstanding the appellant's failure to attend.
     7. The appellant was aware  of  the  date,  time,  and  place  of  the
        hearing, and for the reasons set out below  the  dismissal  of  the
        claim, if legal error is  found,  is  the  only  available  outcome
        irrespective of whether the appellant attends or not.



Background


     8. Mr Qaisir is a citizen of Pakistan born on 8 February 1989.  On  13
        October 2014, he made an application for leave to remain as a  Tier
        4 (General) Student Migrant which was refused on 2  September  2015
        and  a  direction  for  his  removal,  pursuant   to   section   47
        Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006, was made.
     9. Mr Qaisir elected for the merits of the appeal to be decided on the
        papers without an oral hearing. The Secretary of State refused  the
        application by reference to paragraph  322(2)  of  the  Immigration
        Rules, on the basis that evidence provided  by  ETS  satisfied  the
        decision-maker that the  appellant's  English-language  certificate
        had been obtained fraudulently by the use of a proxy.  Accordingly,
        Mr Qaisir was not found  to  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
        245ZX(a) of the Rules. Further, Mr Qaisir did not provide  a  valid
        CAS which is a mandatory document required for leave as  a  Tier  4
        Migrant.
    10. The Judge sets out her findings at paragraphs [6 - 8] which are  in
        the following terms:


        "6.  The Respondent has refused  the  application  under  paragraph
             322(2) of HC 395 and  bears  the  burden  of  proof  that  her
             decision is reasonable and in accordance  with  the  law.  The
             refusal was  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  produced  a
             fraudulent TOEIC certificate. The Respondent has not  however,
             provided  the  certificate  or  any  evidence  from   ETS   to
             substantiate  her  decision.  In  the  absence  of  any   such
             evidence, I find that the Respondent has  not  discharged  the
             burden of proof in respect of her decision under 322 (2) of HC
             395.


        7.   The Applicant has  provided  a  CAS  dated  15  May  2013  for
             Birmingham Informatics College  Ltd,  Sponsor  licence  number
             VH0RB28R4. The Appellant's case is that the college has in the
             past year, had its licence revoked. Applying the principles in
             the cases of Patel (revocation of sponsors licence  -fairness)
             [2011] UKUT 211 (IAC) and Kaur  (Patel  fairness:  respondents
             policy) [2013] UKUT 344 (IAC), I find, in this instance  where
             the  Respondent  has  not  substantiated  her  decision  under
             section 322 (2) and where the Appellant's application had  not
             been decided for almost a year, during which time it  appears,
             the Sponsorship licence  was  revoked,  that  the  Respondents
             should  have  considered  whether  or  not  the  Appellant  is
             entitled to a 60 letter under her policy of general fairness.


        8.   Given the above findings, the Respondent's decision is not  in
             accordance with the law. I allow the appeal,  limited  to  the
             extent,  that  the  Respondent  should  consider  her   policy
             fairness in line with my findings in paragraph 7 above."



Grounds



    11. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the basis the
        Judge failed to give adequate reasons for a finding on  a  material
        matter.  It  is  said  the  Secretary  of  State  provided  witness
        statements in the form of the generic material (familiar  to  those
        dealing with ETS cases  in  this  jurisdiction)  together  with  an
        extract  from  the  ETS  spreadsheet  to  assist  her  case.   That
        spreadsheet records details of the test centre, nationality, family
        name, given name, certificate number, and specifically whether  the
        results are stated to be 'invalid' or 'questionable'.  In  relation
        to Mr Qaisir the results are stated to be invalid.
    12. The grounds also challenge the Judges findings in relation  to  the
        CAS claiming no fairness issue arises.
    13. Permission to appeal was granted by another judge of the First-Tier
        Tribunal, the operative part of which is in the following terms:


        "... it is notable that the respondent had not provided  the  TOEIC
        certificate which was alleged to  be  fraudulent.  However,  it  is
        arguable that the  Judge  fell  into  error  in  finding  that  the
        respondent had not provided any evidence from ETS  to  substantiate
        the decision. Within the respondent's  bundle  there  was  material
        including a spreadsheet from ETS. It is  arguable  that  the  Judge
        fell into error in failing to appreciate this evidence  was  before
        the Tribunal and failing to give it any consideration. The  grounds
        of appeal are, therefore, arguable. Permission is  granted  on  all
        grounds pleaded."







Discussion



    14. There have been several decided authorities relating to  ETS  cases
        which have established that where  an  allegation  of  the  use  of
        deception in taking  an  English  language  test  is  made  by  the
        Secretary of State, she  bears  an  initial  evidential  burden  of
        establishing such deception. It has  been  held  that  the  generic
        evidence together  with  information  from  the  ETS  lookup  tool,
        contained in  the  spreadsheet,  is  sufficient  to  discharge  the
        evidential burden that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr  Qaisir
        employed deception.
    15. It is important to  note  the  specific  terminology  used  in  the
        spreadsheet  that   the   results   are   'invalid'   rather   than
        'questionable'. This is strongly suggestive that as a result of the
        voice analysis undertaken  by  ETS,  both  computer-based  and  the
        further verification employees of that company,  the  voice  on  Mr
        Qaisir's  voice  recording  has  been  identified  as  that  of  an
        individual who has been recorded as having sat other English  tests
        on behalf of him or herself and other individuals.
    16. The Judge fails to make any reference to either the  statements  or
        the spreadsheet in the determination or to make specific  reference
        to decided authorities of both the  Upper  Tribunal  and  Court  of
        Appeal.
    17. The finding the Judge's conclusions in relation to the  failure  of
        the Secretary of State to provide any evidence to substantiate  the
        decision is clearly a finding infected by arguable legal error  and
        a possible misdirection in relation to relevant legal principles.
    18. Mr Qaisir was required to  prove  he  had  a  valid  CAS  with  his
        application. This is a mandatory document which will  result  in  a
        refusal of the application if not provided. The CAS referred to  by
        the Judge was used in the application granted on 12 June 2013  when
        Mr Qaisir was granted further leave to remain in the United Kingdom
        as a Tier 4 Migrant until 13 October 2014. A CAS can only  be  used
        once and it appears therefore that Mr Qaisir had no valid  CAS  for
        the application refused on 2 September 2015 which is the subject of
        the appeal.
    19. The refusal specifically states "for applications made on or  after
        22 February 2010 it became mandatory that applications as a Tier  4
        (General) Student Migrant are  accompanied  by  a  Confirmation  of
        Acceptance for Studies (CAS). You  have  provided  no  evidence  to
        establish that you have been assigned a CAS and no  valid  CAS  has
        been found. It has therefore been decided that you have not met the
        requirements and no points have been awarded for your CAS."
    20. This is not a case of an individual having been granted a valid CAS
        which was later declared  invalid  as  a  result  of  a  sponsoring
        college losing its licence, of which the applicant had  no  notice.
        Page 2 of the refusal letter specifically states "In  view  of  the
        fact that you have claimed  30  points  under  Appendix  A  of  the
        Immigration Rules  for  a  valid  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
        Studies (CAS) but no CAS reference number has been  submitted  with
        your application, the Secretary of State is not satisfied that  you
        have a valid CAS. The Secretary of State is therefore not satisfied
        that you have met the requirements to be awarded  30  points  under
        Appendix A of the Immigration Rules."
    21. As no CAS number was provided no  fairness  issue  arguably  arises
        within the remit of Patel or Kaur.
    22. The decision of the Judge is set aside.
    23. In going  on  to  remake  the  decision  the  Secretary  State  has
        discharged evidential burden to prove the  use  of  deception.  The
        evidence provided by Mr Qaisir to rebut the Secretary  States  case
        is extremely limited as noted by the Judge in [4] of  the  decision
        under challenge. This  does  not  discharge  the  burden  upon  the
        appellant and it is accordingly find the  Secretary  of  State  has
        discharged the burden upon her to the required  standard  to  prove
        the use of deception and submission of false documents in  relation
        to a previous  application.  The  appellant's  appeal  against  the
        refusal pursuant to paragraph 322 (2) of the Rules is dismissed.
    24. In any event, the appeal must fail as it has not been made out that
        Mr Qaisir had a valid CAS at the time of his application. This is a
        mandated requirement the omission of which means the appeal must be
        dismissed in any event.


Decision

    25. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    26. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
