For the Respondent:    Mr A Chonan of Immigration Advice Service


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Devittie)  allowing  an  appeal  by   the
    applicant on human rights grounds  against  the  respondent's  decision
    made on 25 June 2014 refusing to grant  her  asylum.   The  appeal  was
    dismissed on asylum and immigration grounds.  In this decision  I  will
    refer to the parties as they were before the First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    applicant  as  the  appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as   the
    respondent.

Background

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Malawi born on [ ] 1996.  She arrived  in
    the UK on 25 September 2010 on a domestic worker visa  valid  until  17
    September 2011.  She was arrested on 3 May 2013,  detained  and  served
    with notice of removal as an overstayer.  On 22 May  2013  she  claimed
    asylum on the basis that she was a victim of trafficking.  She attended
    the screening interview on 29 May 2013 and  her  full  interview  on  3
    October 2013.  In the light of her claim that she had  been  trafficked
    she was referred to the competent authority and on 24 October  2013  it
    was held that there were reasonable grounds to believe  that  this  was
    the case and she was granted a period of discretionary leave.   In  the
    respondent's decision letter of 25 June 2014  it  was  noted  that  the
    appellant had  been  receiving  support  from  the  Poppy  Project  and
    accepted that she was a victim of trafficking as claimed.

3.   However, the respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  was
    entitled to asylum as she was not a member of a particular social group
    within the Refugee Convention, and she had failed to  demonstrate  that
    the authorities in Malawi would be unable or  unwilling  to  offer  her
    protection or that it would be unreasonable to expect her  to  relocate
    in Somalia.  The respondent found the appellant would not  qualify  for
    humanitarian protection or fall within articles 2 or  3  of  the  Human
    Rights Convention.  She went on to consider article 8  but  found  that
    the appellant could not meet the requirements of  the  Rules  and  that
    there  were   no  exceptional   circumstances   which   might   warrant
    consideration outside the Rules.

The Hearing Before the First-tier Tribunal

4.   At the hearing  of  the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    appellant submitted further evidence about the  change  in  her  family
    circumstances since arriving  in  the  UK.   She  met  her  partner  in
    February 2013, a citizen of Malawi, who came to the UK  in  2002  as  a
    student.  He was subsequently granted indefinite leave in 2014.  He  is
    in full-time employment.  They started living together in June 2014 and
    their child, a son, was born on [ ] 2015.

5.   The judge accepted the appellant's evidence that  this  was  a  genuine
    relationship.   The  child's  birth  certificate  was  produced   which
    confirmed that her partner was the father of the  child.   He  attended
    the  hearing  and  presented  a  witness   statement   confirming   the
    relationship and saying that he had  adequate  means  to  maintain  and
    accommodate the appellant and their child.  He has obtained a degree in
    the UK and is employed as a  software  engineer.   However,  the  judge
    found that he had not advanced any credible evidence to  show  that  he
    would not be able to obtain employment in Malawi were he  to  accompany
    the appellant and their child upon their return.  He found that even if
    her partner was minded not to abandon his life in the UK  to  join  the
    appellant in Malawi, he would be able to provide  effective  assistance
    for them whether financial assistance or in  facilitating  her  contact
    with the members of his family network there.  Both the  appellant  and
    her partner would have been well aware that her immigration status  had
    yet to be resolved and there could be no certainty that they  would  be
    able to continue family life in the UK.  For the  reasons  set  out  at
    [14], the judge found  that  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant's child to leave the UK.

6.   The judge then went on to consider article 8.   He  accepted  that  the
    interests of the child were best served by both parents  continuing  to
    live as a family unit and he repeated that there were no  obstacles  to
    the appellant's partner returning to Malawi with his wife and child and
    that if his evidence that he held a degree in software engineering  was
    true this would stand him in good stead in the employment market there.
     He accepted that the appellant's partner had  completed  his  tertiary
    education in the UK and was in full-time employment and that his  clear
    inclination would therefore be not to abandon the life he had built  up
    in the UK in order to join his partner and  child  but,  on  the  other
    hand, his parental instinct would dictate that he follow them to Malawi
    [17].

7.   The judge said that  he  did  not  consider  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control was a compelling factor weighing  in  the
    public interest because the appellant had been found to  be  a  genuine
    victim of trafficking.   Further  the  relationship  between  them  had
    developed in part at  a  time  when  the  appellant  had  been  granted
    discretionary leave outside the Rules.

8.   It was argued on the appellant's behalf that her mental health and  the
    implications of this were she compelled to return were  factors  to  be
    taken into account in the assessment of proportionality.  The appellant
    had been referred by her GP for psychological services to  address  her
    fear of returning to Malawi and the statements she had  made  that  she
    would kill herself on return.  It was further argued that consideration
    should therefore be given to the impact on her son in the event of them
    returning together which might result in the appellant being unable  to
    care for him or have a detrimental impact on her ability to do so given
    that she had repeatedly set out she had  no  family  and  it  had  been
    accepted by the competent authority that she had been trafficked [19].

9.   The judge commented that the appellant's partner had not  produced  any
    documentary evidence to support his contention that his income was well
    above the threshold of ï¿½22,000 per annum and that, consequently he  was
    able to provide maintenance and accommodation for his  wife  and  child
    without the need for recourse to public funds.  He  was  not  therefore
    satisfied that the financial requirements of the Rules  could  be  met.
    The judge said that in the light of the lack of evidence to demonstrate
    the financial means of her partner the economic wellbeing of the UK was
    a factor that weighed heavily against the appellant in  the  assessment
    of proportionality.

10.  He found that the appellant was a genuine  victim  of  trafficking  and
    that he was bound using the lower standard  of  proof  to  accord  some
    weight to the medical report which raised the risk of the appellant not
    being able properly to care for her son because of her mental  frailty.
    It did not seem to the judge that the fact  that  she  would  have  the
    financial support of her partner would mitigate the risk and  it  might
    be that her mental state would be more stable if her  partner  were  to
    return with her, noting that this was an agonising  decision  which  as
    parents  they  had  to  make.   The  judge  said  that  it   was   this
    consideration touching on the best interests  of  the  child  that  was
    decisive  in  reaching  his  conclusion   that,   notwithstanding   the
    considerable weight he attached the economic wellbeing of the  UK,  the
    potentially serious consequences to the child must outweigh the  public
    interest in the economic wellbeing of the UK.  For  these  reasons  the
    appeal was allowed under article 8.

The Grounds and Submissions

11.  In the grounds it is argued that the judge materially erred in  law  by
    allowing the appeal outside the Immigration Rules while dismissing  the
    appeal on the same issue within the Rules.  The grounds  refer  to  the
    decision in AM (s117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260.   They  argue  that  the
    issues in para  EX1  are  mirrored  in  s117B(6)  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and that the  judge  has  answered  the
    same question with contradictory answers.  In [14] of the decision  the
    judge had found that it would be reasonable to expect  the  appellant's
    child to leave the UK but in [21] that it  would  be  unreasonable  and
    contrary to the best interests of their  child  to  accompany  them  to
    Malawi.

12.  Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "The grounds complain that having found that it was  reasonable  to
         expect a child to relocate in Malawi in respect of the  Immigration
         Rules 276ADE(1)(iv) no different result  should  have  obtained  re
         s117(B)(6) of the 2002 Act, so that the reasoning of  the  decision
         lacks coherence."


13.  Mr Tufan adopted these grounds arguing that the judge had erred in  law
    by making contradictory findings on whether it was reasonable  for  the
    child to return to Malawi.  He had considered  article  8  outside  the
    Rules  without  considering   whether   there   were   any   compelling
    circumstances justifying such consideration when he had found that  the
    appellant had been unable to meet the requirements of  the  Rules.   Mr
    Chonan accepted that he was in some difficulties in trying  to  support
    the  decision.   It  was,  however,  his  submission  that  there  were
    compelling circumstances which would justify the judge's  decision  and
    that if the First-tier Tribunal was set aside, it  should  be  remitted
    for a fresh hearing before that Tribunal.

Consideration of whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in Law

14.  I am satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal did err in  law  such  that
    its decision should be set aside.  When considering para EX1 the  judge
    found for the reasons set out in [14] that it would  be  reasonable  to
    expect the appellant's child to  leave  the  UK  but  when  considering
    article 8 outside the Rules found that there were  potentially  serious
    consequences to  the  child  leaving  the  UK  outweighing  the  public
    interest  in  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the  UK.   These   findings
    contradict  each  other.   If  there  were  such  potentially   serious
    consequences in the appellant returning to Malawi, it is  hard  to  see
    how it could be reasonable to expect the child to return with her.  The
    judge has therefore failed to give adequate reasons making it clear why
    he reached his decision.

15.  Further, in the light of  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in
    Secretary of State v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 the judge erred  by
    carrying  out  a  freestanding  article  8  exercise  without  properly
    considering whether there was a reasonably arguable case which had  not
    been sufficiently dealt with under the substantive  provisions  of  the
    Rules.  In this context when considering the position outside the Rules
    the judge clearly failed to take into account his finding that it would
    be reasonable to expect the appellant's child to leave the UK.

16.  For these reasons the judge erred in law and the decision must  be  set
    aside.  Both Mr Tufan and Mr Chonan agreed that the decision should  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  full  re-hearing.   At  the
    hearing Mr Tufan raised the issue of whether in fact there had  been  a
    right to appeal on human rights grounds in the light of the  fact  that
    the  appellant  had  been  granted  discretionary  leave.   Mr   Chonan
    indicated there was further evidence that he would wish  to  adduce  in
    support of the appeal.  I am satisfied the remittal of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is the proper course to take.  It will be for that Tribunal to
    consider what directions need to be issued.  Any issues of jurisdiction
    can be raised before the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

17.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and its  decision  is  set  aside.
    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  reconsideration,
    by way of and a full re-hearing.  No application has been made to  vary
    or discharge the anonymity order made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    that order therefore remains in force.
