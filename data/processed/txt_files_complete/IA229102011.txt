Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss J Bond instructed by S J Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The  appellant,  a  citizen   of   Nigeria,   appealed   against   the
    determination by First-tier Tribunal Judge Walters sent on 21 September
    2011 dismissing her appeal against a decision made by the respondent on
    20 July 2011 to remove her as an illegal entrant.  This was in response
    to the appellant's application made in May 2010 seeking to  be  allowed
    to stay on the basis of her  long  residence,  fears  about  return  to
    Nigeria and disruption of her established private life ties in the  UK.
    She had made an  earlier  application  in  September  2005,  which  was
    refused in September 2008.  On 11  April  2012  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Garratt set aside Judge Walters's determination  specifying  that
    the re-making of the determination was confined to human rights  issues
    only.

2.   In the reasons given by the respondent  for  refusing  the  appellant's
    application,  it  was  stated  that  the  appellant   had   failed   to
    substantiate her claimed period of residence (19 years  6  months)  and
    that "it is highly likely that deception has been employed in order  to
    gain leave ..." "albeit with or without her knowledge".  The  appellant
    claimed that she had arrived in the UK in 1992 with a woman she  called
    her aunt who press ganged her into domestic cleaning work.  In 1998 she
    left her aunt and with the help of a woman who befriended her at a  bus
    stop found work and enrolled on a course to qualify as a nurse.   After
    seeking help in  2005  from  solicitors  (Total  Legal  Services)  with
    legalising her position in the UK, she discovered they were  submitting
    fraudulent documents on her behalf.  In January 2009 her new solicitors
    produced a sworn affidavit declaring that she  had  never  given  Total
    Legal  Services  any  British  Gas  bills,  Thames  Water  bills,  bank
    statements or  wage  slips  and  documents  which  the  respondent  had
    examined and found to be bogus.

3.   At the hearing  before  Judge  Walters  the  appellant  reiterated  her
    earlier account, confirming that the  only  documents  she  gave  Total
    Legal Services were documents from Newham College relating to residency
    between September 2004 - July 2005, five certificates  from  Heart  Aid
    which gave  no  indication  of  her  address  and  her  City  &  Guilds
    certificate which also did not contain any reference  to  her  address.
    She  produced  at  the  hearing  documentary  evidence  that  she   was
    registered with the NHS between 2002-2005, a photograph of her  with  a
    small child on her back on  the  back  of  which  was  written  "2002."
    Another photograph, he said,  was  taken  in  2003.   There  were  also
    witness statements from two friends, Mr Williams, who said he first met
    her in 2001 and Mr Faseha who had first met her in 2004 when they  were
    both studying at Newham College.  He said the appellant had become part
    of his family and was especially close to his children aged 2 and 4.

4.   Whilst the determination of Judge Williams has  been  set  aside,  both
    parties were in agreement that certain of his findings of fact were not
    in dispute in particular that Mr Williams had met the appellant in 2001
    and that "the Appellant has established a private life in the UK  since
    2001."

5.   At the hearing before me Miss Bond clarified that whilst she was  aware
    that the appellant's residence in the UK since 2001 was  no  longer  in
    dispute, the appellant continued to maintain that she  had  arrived  in
    the UK in 1992 and she and her witnesses wished to give evidence  about
    that, as well as about a very recent development in the nature  of  the
    relationship between her and Mr Williams.

6.    The  appellant  gave  evidence,  speaking  first  about   the   recent
    development in her  relationship  with  Mr  Williams.   They  had  been
    friends since 2001 but  over  the  past  year  had  grown  closer.   In
    December 2012 they had decided she should move in with him and she  did
    this in March 2013.  She confirmed she had arrived in the UK  in  1992,
    brought here aged 13 by a lady whom she knew as her aunt although  they
    were not related.  She could not remember any significant  events  over
    that time.  Her aunt had made her do cleaning work in  the  Walthamstow
    area, but she did not go out on her own  and  did  not  use  trains  or
    buses, had not visited a doctor and did not watch TV.  She  thought  it
    odd that children her own age she saw in houses where she went to clean
    went to school whereas she did not.  She did not have anyone  to  speak
    to about it.  Her aunt told her if she tried to run away she  would  be
    taken away.  She stayed with her aunt six years.  When she  decided  to
    leave, she met a lady at a bus stop who helped her  and  took  her  in.
    She stayed with her one year; she got work.  She had  tried  to  locate
    this lady to be a witness in her appeal but could not find her.

7.   In cross-examination the appellant said she had never had any bills  or
    bank account or letters to show where she had lived prior to 2001.  She
    was asked how it was her relationship with  Mr  Williams  had  recently
    changed given that she had said in her earlier witness  statement  that
    she had told him earlier she wanted them to be just friends.  She  said
    he had tested her and they had grown closer and now they were a  couple
    living together.  When  she  was  with  her  aunt  she  had  been  very
    isolated, there were no other children in the house.  She  stayed  with
    her aunt until she was 19.

8.   Asked why she had a strong Nigerian accent,  the  appellant  said  that
    was because she had lived there a long time and did not  speak  English
    when with her aunt.  In Nigeria she had gone to primary school but left
    before getting a primary school certificate.  She had obtained City and
    Guilds certificate and was training to be a nurse.  She had learnt sign
    language.

9.   Asked if she knew that Total Legal  Services  were  applying  for  long
    residency on her behalf, she said she  had  told  them  she  wanted  to
    become a nurse here and they had asked for  her  college  certificates.
    She had given them the documents they asked for and left  it  to  them.
    She never  knew  they  had  applied  for  long  residency  using  false
    certificates.  When she got the Home Office refusal letter in 2008  she
    had tried to find out from the solicitors what had happened,  but  they
    said the person dealing with their case was ill.  She did not know  why
    they had gone to the trouble of manufacturing documents.

10.  Regarding the friendship with Mr Faseha and his family,  she  said  she
    had described her as an aunt to his children because  she  had  got  to
    know him and his family very well.

11.  Asked by me whether the aunt from whom she had escaped still  lived  in
    the same area, she said she was ever worried  about  bumping  into  her
    aunt she said she had not spent much time out and about.  Asked  by  me
    whether Total Legal Solutions had asked her for documents  about  where
    she lived, she said she had given them the college  documents  and  did
    not know about any others.

12.  The next witness was Mr Williams.   Originally  a  signing  interpreter
    had been booked to assist him, but was not available at the time  fixed
    for the hearing.  Miss Bond said she had discussed the matter  with  Mr
    Williams and established that he was not fully deaf and felt  he  could
    manage without a signing interpreter by a  combination  of  lip-reading
    and partial hearing.

13.  Both representatives moved very near the  witness  to  help  ensure  he
    could see and hear them.  Miss Bond also undertook to repeat everything
    I said to the witness.  I explained to Mr Williams that if he  had  any
    difficulties he should put his hand up and we would take stock.  In the
    event he was able to hear satisfactorily everything said  and  his  own
    answers to questions were very clear.

14.  Mr Williams confirmed he had been born in the UK.  He  had  a  brother,
    sister and other relatives here.  He had been deaf since  aged  4.   He
    had met the appellant in 2004.  She had told him she had arrived in the
    UK in 1992 and had been forced to do cleaning work by a lady  known  to
    her as an aunt.  She had told him that this lady  had  taken  away  her
    passport and treated her like a slave.   When  she  ran  away  she  had
    received help and a room over her head from a lady who had helped  her.
    She had said to him that she had stayed with this lady some  time.   He
    was now in a relationship with the  appellant.  They  had  been  living
    together since February.

15.  In cross-examination Mr Williams said he could not say  why  there  was
    no updated statement from him about the development in his relationship
    with the appellant.  He agreed he had said  in  his  witness  statement
    that it was best if  they  were  just  friends,  but  things  had  just
    developed.  He knew her mother tongue was Yoruba.  If the appellant had
    to go back to Nigeria, he would support her in applying to come back to
    be with him.

16.  Asked by me whether the appellant had specifically  mentioned  1992  as
    the date she arrived, he said she had.  He was in work.   He  currently
    kept all bills in his name.

17.  Mr Faseha also gave evidence as  he  had  done  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He apologised for having no witness statement.  He  had  met
    the appellant in 2004 at  Newham  College  and  she  soon  became  good
    friends with him and his wife and children.  He remembered  her  saying
    she had come to the UK in 1991.  He saw her twice a week.  She came  to
    his family home and sometimes his wife invited her to  stay.   She  had
    told him recently that she was now in a relationship with  Mr  Williams
    and that they were living together.

18.  In cross-examination he said he had found  out  the  appellant  and  Mr
    Williams were living together in March, she said she had  moved  in  in
    February.  He (Mr Faseha) had been abroad for a month.  When  they  met
    it was he who encouraged her to study to become a nurse and he believed
    she had great zeal.  She came to his house at least once a  week.   His
    wife is Hungarian; he came to the UK in 1996 and married in 2007.

19.  In submissions Mr Tufan asked me to dismiss the appellant's  Article  8
    appeal.  He submitted that the respondent had been  right  to  conclude
    she must have been complicit in the submission by Total Legal Solutions
    of fraudulent documents.  That was a relevant factor in the  Article  8
    assessment.

20.  As regards the length of the appellant's residence  in  the  UK,  there
    was no documentary evidence of her presence before 2002  and  no  basis
    for departing from the First-tier Tribunal finding that  she  had  only
    been resident here since 2001.  The appellant's evidence about the 1992-
    2001 period was vague and unconvincing and reliance on what she told Mr
    Williams and Mr Faseha was not enough.

21.  Mr Tufan said he was prepared to accept that  the  appellant  had  been
    friends with Mr Williams since 2001, but the claim at the door  of  the
    court that they were now cohabiting was difficult to  square  with  his
    previous witness statement that she had to him said they should just be
    friends.  It was also difficult to follow how Mr Faseha  (who  said  he
    saw the appellant at least once a week) did not know until  March  2013
    they had decided to live together, when the couple's evidence was  they
    had decided to live together before moving in a month or  so  later  in
    December.  If the couple are accepted as now being in  a  relationship,
    she could go back to Nigeria and apply there as a fianc�e or  unmarried
    partner.

22.  Even if it was accepted the appellant saw Mr Faseha's children  once  a
    week, that was not enough to have created family life ties between  her
    and them.  Whilst the fact that the appellant had learnt sign  language
    and was using this to help people  in  the  community  was  a  relevant
    factor but was not one which should carry  significant  weight  in  the
    Article 8 balancing exercise.  The  Court  of  Appeal  decision  in  UE
    (Nigeria) [2010] EWCA Civ 975 did not assist the appellant's case.

23.  Miss Bond began by apologising for  not  having  alerted  the  Tribunal
    before today to the fact that the appellant and Mr  Williams  had  been
    cohabiting since March; she had only learnt of it  today.   However  it
    was a fact before the Tribunal.  She urged that I  find  the  appellant
    generally credible.  There had been every opportunity on  the  part  of
    the police and/or immigration authorities to prosecute her for fraud in
    relation to the false documents submitted by Total Legal  Solutions  on
    her behalf, but they had not done anything.  The appellant did not even
    sign the application form submitted by Total Legal Solutions.   It  had
    to be borne in mind that the appellant had been trafficked  to  the  UK
    when only 13 years old and was clearly extremely dependent on help from
    others and she was not the only one who had been duped by  Total  Legal
    Solution.

24.  Whether the Tribunal considered the appellant had been in the UK  since
    1992 or 2001 she  had  been  here  a  very  considerable  period  at  a
    formative stage of her life.  Clearly there had been a close friendship
    between the appellant and Mr Williams since 2001 and whether classified
    as private life or family life, it  should  carry  considerable  weight
    especially as she was clearly providing strong support to  Mr  Williams
    in coping with his deafness and was also putting her signing skills  to
    use in the community, which  represented  a  valuable  and  much-needed
    skill.  The UE case did assist the appellant.

My Assessment

25.  As both parties agreed,  the  only  issue  before  me  is  whether  the
    decision made against the appellant was contrary to her  human  rights.
    Before the First-tier Tribunal Judge  the  appellant  claimed  she  had
    specific fears about returning to Nigeria.    These  she  rejected  and
    although her decision has been set aside the appellant has  not  sought
    to pursue this aspect of her claim before me.  Whilst the  decision  of
    the First Tribunal Judge has been set aside it is  common  ground  that
    his findings establish that the appellant has been in the  UK  from  at
    least 2001.

26.  The appellant has sought to maintain her claim that  she  had  in  fact
    been in the UK since 1992 spending the first six years here in  virtual
    slavery.  I regret to say I do  not  find  this  aspect  of  her  claim
    credible.  I accept Miss Bond's point that if her account is true  then
    she would have had limited ability to  document  her  life  in  the  UK
    between 1992-2001.  Mr Tufan queried whether if she had been in the  UK
    since 1992 she would still have a strong "Nigerian accent," but if  her
    account was correct, she had not spoken English hardly at  all  between
    1992-2001, so I discard this as a  significant  matter.   At  the  same
    time, she has now had the assistance of two sets  of  solicitors  since
    2009.  It is well-documented that Total Legal Solicitors were shut down
    and several working there  convicted  of  criminal  offences,  but  her
    subsequent solicitors have clearly taken efforts to advance  her  case,
    yet there is nothing to suggest that  she  or  they  made  any  serious
    attempt to identify the aunt to the police or to  take  action  against
    her for the tort of slavery.  The appellant was only able  to  say  she
    had looked for her aunt once without  success.   There  is  nothing  to
    suggest either that the appellant  or  her  solicitors  had  sought  to
    locate the woman who had taken her in for about a year or the person or
    persons who had given her work.  The appellant was  not  even  able  to
    identify, the address of the house of the woman  who  had  helped  her.
    The appellant said she could not produce any official  letters  because
    she had not had contact with them and had not  gone  to  a  doctor.   I
    consider that it is unlikely she would not  have  had  contact  with  a
    doctor or other government or local authority services soon  after  she
    begun to live with the woman who helped her.  I  also  consider  it  is
    unlikely that having and on her account had no schooling since she  was
    6 the appellant was able to obtain the qualification she did so quickly
    especially as on her own account when she was with  her  aunt  she  was
    living an isolated life and did not mention doing anything but cleaning
    work.

27.  I acknowledge that the appellant's two witnesses  have  given  evidence
    that she told them she had been  in  the  UK  since  1991/1992  in  the
    circumstances she also set out in her own evidence.  However,  both  Mr
    Williams and Mr Faseha are personal friends  and  lack  the  status  of
    independent witnesses.  Weighing factors for and against, I regret I do
    not accept their evidence on this score.

28.  I turn to consider the nature and extent  of  the  appellant's  private
    and family life ties since 2001.  Whilst I am prepared to  accept  that
    she has known Mr Fahesa and his family since 2004, I do not accept that
    the relationship has been as regular as claimed.  In my judgment if the
    appellant had been to his house at least once a week  (except  for  one
    month when he was away), then it is most unlikely she  would  not  have
    told him and his wife straightaway her news about Mr Williams and their
    decision made in December 2012 to live together.  Mr Faseha's  evidence
    was that he did not learn about this until March 2013.  Despite his and
    the appellant's claims that she was like an aunt to his  two  children,
    no photos have been produced of them together.  Even if it was accepted
    that she had a bond with the children, she did not live with  them  and
    saw them at best once or twice  a  week.   There  was  no  evidence  to
    suggest that Mr Faseha and his wife were not full-time  primary  carers
    of their two children.   This  is  not  to  say  that  the  appellant's
    relationship with Mr Faseha and his family has not  been  an  important
    one but it is not one which establishes strong ties here.

29.  As regards the appellant's relationship with Mr Williams, it  is  clear
    that (like her relationship with Mr Faseha) this too has  been  a  very
    important relationship for both of them and it is one that is  over  10
    years old.  For all but the last  six  months,  however,  it  has  been
    limited to one of personal friendship and neither has sought to suggest
    that up until very recently Mr Williams was economically or emotionally
    dependent on the appellant or vice versa.

30.  The evidence of both the appellant and Mr Williams is that  the  nature
    of their relationship has changed and they  are  now  living  together.
    Having heard from both of them and  observed  their  interaction  I  am
    prepared to accept that they are presently in a close relationship  and
    that they now live together.  I do  not  accept,  however,  that  their
    relationship changed as long ago as December 2012 or  that  they  began
    living together  since  March.   When  setting  the  case  down  for  a
    continuation hearing the Upper Tribunal made clear that  the  appellant
    should  produce  any  further  relevant  evidence  and  she  has   been
    represented by competent solicitors.  If  the  couple  had  decided  in
    December to live together or to have begun  living  together  in  March
    then the appellant would surely have known the importance of  informing
    her solicitors and/or the Tribunal about this.  Yet Miss Bond  said  it
    had not been mentioned to her legal representatives until  the  day  of
    the hearing.  Nor, apart from the same witness Mr Fahesa has there been
    any evidence submitted from friends or neighbours of Mr  Williams.   As
    already noted, I also consider that if the appellant and Mr Faseha  had
    been truthful in their account of being in weekly  contact,  Mr  Faseha
    would have known about the  change  in  the  couple's  relationship  in
    December/January.  Yet he said the first he knew about it was in  March
    2013.  My conclusion is that the close relationship between Mr Williams
    and the appellant is a very recent development and  that  this  reduces
    the weight I can attach to it.  Their relationship is  a  private  life
    tie established over ten years which has very recently intensified, but
    it is to be contrasted with an  established  relationship  based  on  a
    significant period of cohabitation.

31.  It is clear that  it  represents  a  potential  interference  with  the
    appellant's right to respect for private life.  It is  not  in  dispute
    that the refusal decision pursues a legitimate aim.

32.  Turning to assessment of the proportionality of the decision,  I  count
    in favour of the appellant that she has been in the UK since 2001, that
    during that time she has developed private life ties of friendship with
    the family of Mr Faseha and also with Mr Williams, that she has  sought
    to better herself through  obtaining  qualifications  with  a  view  to
    training as a nurse, that she has learnt sign language which is a skill
    she has put to good use already and could continue  to  do  so  in  the
    future.  In respect of her ties with Mr Faseha and his family, however,
    I do not consider these amounted either to family  life  ties  or  very
    close private life ties.  In respect of Mr  Williams,  I  have  already
    observed that although  I  accept  this  has  been  a  strong  personal
    friendship over a decade long it has not until very recently  been  one
    of cohabitation nor one that has involved  any  specific  financial  or
    emotional dependency.

33.  I count against the appellant that she has been in  the  UK  unlawfully
    throughout her time in the UK.  I do not accept that the  circumstances
    of her arrival and subsequent stay involved coercion or  duress  and  I
    specifically reject her claim to have arrived in 1992 and being  forced
    into domestic servitude.  As regards her involvement in the  fraudulent
    application made on her behalf in 2005 by Total Legal Solutions, I have
    serious reservations about her claim to have played no part in it and I
    find it implausible that the legal advisers at this firm would not have
    discussed with her the need for her to obtain documents  to  prove  her
    residence and addresses in the UK since her arrival.   On  her  account
    they only ever asked her for  documents  relating  to  her  educational
    qualification.  Yet the application they made was  for  long  residence
    and if they saw fit to ask her for  educational  documents,  why  would
    they not also have asked for  documents  showing  residence.  The  most
    likely answer, in my judgment, is that they did ask and she  told  them
    she could not provide them because in fact she was not here until 2001.
    But it is unnecessary for me to rule whether she was a knowing party to
    the fraud, since at the very least she was clearly negligent in relying
    on those advisers to pursue an application of a kind she said she never
    knew about.

34.  I count against the appellant that the development in the  relationship
    with Mr Williams beyond that of friendship was clearly commenced by her
    in full knowledge of her previous immigration status.

35.  As observed earlier, the appellant has not  proved  earlier  claims  to
    fear for her safety and wellbeing on return to Nigeria and  I  consider
    both the respondent and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  gave  cogent
    reasons why such fears have no objective  basis.   On  the  evidence  I
    consider that the appellant has spent all of her life  as  a  child  in
    Nigeria and did not come to the UK until 19.  The fact that  whilst  in
    the  UK  she  has  obtained  some  employment  experience  and  college
    qualifications will undoubtedly stand her in good stead in  readjusting
    to life in Nigeria upon return.

36.  Miss Bond has sought to argue that I  should  consider  that  Chikwamba
    [2008] UKHL 40 principles as clarified in  subsequent  case  law  point
    towards a decision that I allow her appeal so that she can now  develop
    her relationship with  Mr  Williams  either  as  a  fianc�e,  unmarried
    partner or spouse, without the need for her to  return  to  Nigeria  to
    apply for entry clearance. I have had careful regard to  Chikwamba  and
    subsequent authorities seeking  to  refine  its  principles,  including
    Kussin, R (on the application of) v SSHD [2009] EWHC  358  (Admin)  (22
    January  2009).   Given  my  finding  that  the  development   of   the
    appellant's and Mr Williams' relationship into one of  cohabitation  is
    very recent, I do not consider that would be a justified step to  take,
    particularly given that  the  development  has  taken  place  when  the
    appellant has had a pending Article 8 appeal.  In my judgement there is
    no proper basis for considering that any  possible  future  application
    for the appellant to be admitted as an unmarried  partner,  fianc�e  or
    spouse of Mr Williams would be straightforward.  The couple have yet to
    demonstrate their relationship is not just short-term and that she  can
    fulfil all the requirements of the relevant Immigration Rules.

37.  For the above reasons:

38.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge  (which  is  annexed)  be
    set aside.

39.   The  decision  I  re-make  is  to  dismiss  the  appellant's   appeal.

Upper Tribunal Judge Storey


REASONS FOR FINDING THAT THE TRIBUNAL MADE AN ERROR OF LAW, SUCH THAT ITS
DECISION FALLS TO BE SET ASIDE



 1. On 6th October 2011 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal J M Holmes refused
    permission to the appellant to  appeal  against  the  determination  of
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Walters who dismissed  the  appeal  on
    human rights grounds against the decision of the respondent  to  remove
    the appellant under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum  Act  1999
    following the refusal  of  her  human  rights  claim.   However,  in  a
    decision dated 10th November 2011 Judge of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Keki?
    sitting in the Upper Tribunal granted permission.

 2. In the grounds of application to  the  Upper  Tribunal  representatives
    took issue with the judge's  credibility  findings  concerning  a  long
    residence claim which had been supported  by  false  documentation  but
    through representatives claimed to have acted dishonestly.  It is  also
    argued that the judge should not have raised the issue  of  application
    of paragraph 322(1A) of the Immigration Rules when this was not  raised
    by the respondent in the refusal decision.  It is further  argued  that
    the  judge  did  not  take  into  account  the  "numerous  photographs"
    produced.  As to the Article 8 claim representatives  submit  that  the
    judge's approach to the issue of  the  existence  of  family  life  was
    flawed and the requirement set out in Kugathas [2003] INLR 170 had  not
    been considered nor had the respondent's obligations under  Section  55
    of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009  presumably  in
    relation to  Mr  Faseha's  daughters.   Further  the  judge  failed  to
    consider the respondent's exercise of jurisdiction under paragraph 395C
    of the Immigration Rules.

 3. When granting permission Judge of the Upper Tribunal Keki? though  that
    the criticism of the judge's approach to Article 8 and  his  conclusion
    suggested that arguable errors of law had been made and,  particularly,
    consideration of proportionality at paragraph 52 of  the  determination
    was inadequate.  She also thought it arguable that the judge was  wrong
    to raise  paragraph  322(1A)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  of  his  own
    volition.  She also thought that the  reason  for  Counsel  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  not  seeking  to  argue  the  appeal  under   the
    Immigration Rules needed to be clarified.

 4. In relation to the latter matter  it  is  evident,  from  the  decision
    appealed against that the appellant had applied for the  respondent  to
    consider her claim to remain on human rights grounds only following the
    failure of the application to remain on the  basis  of  long  residence
    which had been refused by the respondent on 5th September 2008  because
    of the submission of documents which could not be relied  upon.   Thus,
    human rights issues only arise in this appeal.

 5. In submissions Ms Bond confirmed  that  the  appellant  relied  on  the
    grounds put to the Upper Tribunal.  She further conceded  that  it  was
    irrelevant for the judge to apply the provisions of  paragraph  322(1A)
    of the Immigration Rules as it  was  irrelevant  to  the  human  rights
    application made.  However, the judge  had  fixed  the  appellant  with
    knowledge of the former representatives' claimed dishonesty.  The  firm
    involved, Total Legal Services, was  now  the  subject  of  a  criminal
    investigation although she was unable to put any information before  me
    to confirm that  position.   The  judge  had  failed  to  consider  the
    appellant's involvement in  claimed  dishonesty  under  the  principles
    established in  AA  (Nigeria)  in  circumstances  where  the  appellant
    claimed to know nothing about the dishonesty of representatives.  There
    had been no Presenting Officer at the First-tier hearing and so it  was
    important that the allegation of fraud, the  burden  of  proving  which
    rested upon the respondent, had to be properly considered.  The judge's
    conclusion also affected the findings in  relation  to  Article  8  and
    consideration of proportionality was inadequate.

 6. Mr Saunders also agreed that Article 8 issues only were relevant.   The
    appellant could not have succeeded on  the  claim  of  long  residence.
    Whilst he agreed that consideration of proportionality could have  been
    more thorough he pointed out that  the  judge  had  accepted  that  the
    appellant had been in the United Kingdom since  2001  although  without
    leave to remain.  It was also not in dispute  that  the  appellant  had
    gained a qualification in lip-reading whilst in  the  country  even  if
    without leave.  My attention was drawn to the appellant's statement  in
    the bundle before the First-tier Tribunal at page 14 which, he thought,
    made no mention of the establishment of family life.  On this basis  he
    thought that the judge's findings on family life were sound.  As to the
    omission of reference to all of the  photographs  produced  he  thought
    this was not relevant in  view  of  the  judge's  acceptance  that  the
    appellant had been in the country from 2001.

 7. Ms Bond argued that the judge had not  paid  proper  attention  to  the
    evidence of Mr Faseha at the hearing or  that  of  Mr  Williams  before
    reaching conclusions about the Article 8 claim.

 8. At the end of the hearing I announced that I  was  satisfied  that  the
    determination showed errors on points of law such that  it  should  re-
    made.  My reasons for reaching that conclusion follow.

 9. The judge was wrong to consider that paragraph 322(1A) could be applied
    to the circumstances of the  appeal  because  the  appellant  had  been
    involved in the submission of false representations or false documents.
     The application which forms the subject of this appeal  covered  human
    rights issues  only.   Issues  relating  to  the  submission  of  false
    documents arose at the time of the  refusal  of  the  appellant's  long
    residence claim in September 2008 but even then, the respondent did not
    apply any of the provisions of Part 9 of the Immigration Rules  to  the
    refusal.  Refusals under that part are made at the  discretion  of  the
    respondent and should not be applied by the Tribunal at the time of the
    hearing.

10. Although, on the face of  it,  the  judge's  application  of  paragraph
    322(1A) to his decision appears irrelevant, it is clear that the  judge
    placed weight upon the  credibility  of  the  appellant's  claims  when
    dealing with the Article 8 claim.  As paragraph 53 of the determination
    states, the appellant was found to be generally not credible and so the
    claim that the appellant had no family in Nigeria to return to was  not
    believed because of general incredibility.  The judge's approach to the
    appellant's credibility with  reference  to  the  submission  of  false
    documents is also flawed because the judge did not  show  that  he  was
    aware that the burden of proof rested upon the respondent as  indicated
    in [blank] and an intention to deceive by the appellant had to be shown
    (AA (Nigeria)) by relying upon the appellant's perceived dishonesty  in
    the past the judge was therefore  in  error  in  his  approach  to  the
    Article 8 claim and the facts which supported it.  On  this  basis  the
    determination should be re-made.

11. I should pointed out that I  was  unable  to  proceed  to  re-make  the
    determination because the appellant's Article  8  witness,  Mr  M  A  E
    Williams required an English sign language interpreter but one had  not
    been booked.
