                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Caskie, Advocate, instructed by Latta & Co,
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision by
       Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mc Manus.  The First-tier Tribunal
       allowed an appeal by Mahabad [M] (hereinafter referred to as "the
       claimant"), who is a national of Iraq.

    2. The grant of permission to appeal states that the First-tier Tribunal
       found the claimant credible as to her history and fear of harm but
       there was no real risk of persecution on return.  The appeal was
       allowed under Articles 2 and 3 based upon the claimant's lack of a
       CSID card and her inability to obtain one on return.  Nevertheless at
       paragraph 46 of the decision the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       stated that the appellant was entitled to refugee status.  This was
       arguably an error of law as on the facts found the claimant would be
       entitled to humanitarian protection.

    3. At the hearing before me Mr Caskie informed me that an amended
       decision had been issued on 12th November 2018 by the Judge of the
       First-tier Tribunal correcting the error identified in the grant of
       permission to appeal.  Copies of the amended decision were produced.
       The amended decision made it clear that the claimant was entitled to
       humanitarian protection.

    4. I am satisfied that the arguable error described in the grant of
       permission to appeal has been rectified by the issuing of the amended
       decision under rule 31 of the Procedure Rules.  Accordingly there is
       no error of law in the amended decision of 12th November 2018 of the
       First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions

    5. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
       the making of an error on a point of law.

    6. The decision allowing the appeal shall stand.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal made a direction for anonymity.  I have not been
asked to continue this direction and I see no reason of substance for doing
so.
