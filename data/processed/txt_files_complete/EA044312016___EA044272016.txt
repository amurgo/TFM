               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr J Gajjar (counsel for M-R Solicitors)
For the Respondent:     Mr S Kotas (Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. These proceedings challenge the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
       of 19 September 2017 to partially allow  the  appeal  of  Daljit  [S]
       (albeit dismissing the appeal of his daughter [SK], born [  ]  2014),
       the appeals below having originally been brought against the  refusal
       of residence cards by a decision of the  Secretary  of  State  of  30
       March 2016.


    2. Daljit [S] arrived in the UK in October 2004 and claimed asylum on  2
       February 2011. He met [SD], a Lithuanian national, and  they  married
       on 6 October 2011. He was granted a  residence  card  as  her  family
       member. Their relationship deteriorated and they divorced.


    3. Daljit [S] claimed to have retained the right of residence under  the
       EEA Regulations given he had been married to [SD] from  October  2011
       until their divorce on 16 June  2015.  The  application  was  refused
       because he had not  demonstrated  that  his  Sponsor  was  exercising
       Treaty Rights up to that date, having provided evidence only up to  5
       May 2015, and he had not shown that he himself had  been  working  as
       claimed, having failed to provide evidence of his work from June 2015
       onwards.


    4. Furthermore, when invited for interview, a number of  inconsistencies
       and concerns were identified in his evidence, leading to the marriage
       being treated as one of convenience.  Accordingly the application was
       refused, and the logic of that reasoning was extended to revoking the
       original residence card he had  been  issued  on  the  basis  of  the
       marriage having previously been treated as genuine.


    5. The First-tier Tribunal heard evidence from Daljit [S], and  accepted
       the argument put on his behalf that the interview transcript was  not
       reliable given it comprised only a summary  rather  than  a  verbatim
       record of the underlying questions and answers. Daljit [S]  contended
       it was not a true or complete reflection of the answers he had given,
       and given that the Presenting Officer who appeared below  was  unable
       to provide a full copy of the original record, and  acknowledged  the
       difficulty in which this placed her, the  First-tier  Tribunal  found
       the Secretary of State had not discharged the burden of proof on  her
       to establish that the relationship was a marriage of convenience.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal  found  that  [SK]  did  not  qualify  for  a
       residence card given the Regulations made no provision  for  a  minor
       daughter of a former spouse to retain their right  of  residence.  It
       accordingly allowed Daljit [S]'s appeal to the extent that  it  found
       the Secretary of State had been  wrong  to  revoke  the  issue  of  a
       residence  card;  however  it  made  no  ruling  as  to  whether  his
       application for a new residence card, on retained rights of residence
       grounds, should have succeeded.


    7. Daljit [S] lodged grounds of appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  against
       that decision, on the  basis  that  it  represented  only  a  partial
       adjudication of the relevant issues:  in  fact  the  refusal  of  the
       residence card acknowledging his retained right of residence had been
       challenged in the original grounds lodged to the First-tier  Tribunal
       against the EEA decision.



Findings and reasons


    8. Before me the parties were agreed that there was a material error  of
       law in the decision below. Having heard  their  submissions,  I  find
       myself in agreement with their position.


    9. The EEA decisions against which a right of appeal lies are identified
       as including the revocation and the refusal of a residence card  (Reg
       2 of The Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016).  The
       appeal form in this particular case plainly raised  an  objection  to
       both those features of the Home Office decision, as both  aspects  of
       the decision are clearly challenged by the grounds of appeal.


   10. Each issue was therefore before the First-tier Tribunal and it should
       not have treated the matter of the application's  refusal  as  beyond
       its jurisdiction. The basis on which it allowed Daljit  [S]'s  appeal
       against revocation inevitably carried over to the appeal against  his
       application's refusal.


   11. No  issue  was  raised  as  to  the  correctness  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal's treatment of his daughter's EEA claim, and so  her  appeal
       stands as dismissed.


   12. I accordingly find that there was a material  error  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  For the decision of the  First-
       tier Tribunal allowing Daljit [S]'s appeal against the revocation  of
       a residence card, I substitute a decision


   a) Allowing Daljit [S]'s appeal against the  revocation  of  a  residence
      card and


   b) Allowing Daljit [S]'s appeal against the refusal  of  his  application
      for a residence card,  and  thus  recognising  that  he  is  owed  the
      extended right of residence (via the retained right of residence).

   13. The decision to dismiss [SK]'s appeal remains undisturbed.

      Decision:

    The appeal of Daljit [S] is allowed. That of [SK] remains dismissed.



Signed:                                            Date: 3 January 2018
