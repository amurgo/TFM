                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Deopartment
                                                                  Respondent
                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant obtained  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 8  December
    2016, which related not only to the instant appellant but  also  to  her
    parents and sibling.

 2. By way of  a  letter  of  the  24  July  2017,  the  appellant  requests
    permission  to  withdraw  her  case  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  as  a
    consequence of her registration as a British citizen on 13 July 2017.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party  to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as  a  whole,
    and observing the terms of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,  I  give
    such consent to the appellant to withdraw.

 4. Accordingly, with my consent and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, the appellant's case  is  treated
    as "withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". If  necessary,  I
    formally dismiss the instant appellant's  appeal.  The  appeals  of  her
    family members (IA/10461/2015, A/10464/2015  and  IA/10481/2015)  remain
    extant before the Upper Tribunal.
