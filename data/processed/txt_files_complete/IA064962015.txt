Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Mangion, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    in person


                            DECISION AND REASONS

        1. The Respondent is a citizen of Pakistan. On 26  August  2013  he
           was granted entry  clearance  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
           expiring on 30 September 2014 in order that he  might  pursue  a
           course of study at the University of Sunderland.
        2. On 27 August 2014 the Respondent applied for a variation of  his
           leave so that he could pursue a further  course  of  study  from
           October 2014 to November 2015, leading to the award of  an  MBM.
           He supplied a valid CAS issued  to  him  by  the  University  in
           support of that application.
        3. That  application  was  refused  on  21  October  2014,  and  in
           consequence a decision was made by reference to s47 of the  2006
           Act to remove him from the UK. Two reasons  were  given  by  the
           Appellant for these decisions. The first referred  to  paragraph
           245ZX(d) and concerned the content of the CAS submitted  by  the
           Respondent in support of his application. It stated that he  had
           outstanding course fees of �1515, which meant that he needed  to
           demonstrate not only that he had the requisite  monies  for  the
           "maintenance" of himself and his dependent spouse, but also that
           sum. The bank statements supplied did not do so,  although  they
           did  demonstrate  sufficient  funds  for  the  "maintenance"  of
           himself  and  his  spouse.  The  second  referred  to  paragraph
           245ZX(ha) and asserted that  the  Respondent  had  already  been
           granted leave to study in the UK at degree level for ten  years,
           and thus the application he had made would result in his  having
           spent more than five years studying at degree level in the UK.
        4. A second refusal of the application and a further decision  made
           by reference to s47 of the 2006 Act to remove him  from  the  UK
           was made on 22 October 2014. Only one reason were given  by  the
           Appellant for these decisions, which repeated the  reference  to
           paragraph 245ZX(d).
        5. The Respondent's appeal referred to  the  immigration  decisions
           made on 22 October 2014. It was heard on 5 May 2015, and allowed
           under the Immigration Rules in a decision promulgated on 13  May
           2015 by First Tier Tribunal Judge Conrath.
        6. By a decision of First Tier Tribunal Judge Grant-Hutchison dated
           29 July 2015 the  First  Tier  Tribunal  granted  the  Appellant
           permission to appeal on the basis it was arguable the Judge  had
           erred in his approach, which had turned upon evidence  that  had
           not  been  supplied  by  the  Respondent  in  support   of   his
           application. Thus the matter comes before me.


      The decision under appeal
        7. I drew to the attention of the parties the  existence  upon  the
           Tribunal file of two refusal decisions dated 21 October 2014 and
           22 October 2014, since there is no reference to  the  former  in
           the Judge's decision. Mr Mangion was unaware of the former,  and
           after checking the Notice of Appeal did refer to the decision of
           22 October 2014 suggested that I should treat the decision of 21
           October 2014 as withdrawn. He accepted that  the  Appellant  was
           unable to substantiate the  second  ground  of  refusal  in  the
           decision of 21 October 2014.
        8. In the circumstances I treat the decision of 21 October 2014  as
           having  been  withdrawn  by  the  Appellant.   The   immigration
           decisions under appeal are those of 22 October 2014.






      The CAS


        9. It was not in dispute before the Judge that the CAS submitted in
           support of the application stated that  there  were  outstanding
           fees of �1515, and that the CAS made no  reference  to  the  two
           scholarships of �1500 and �750  that  the  Respondent  had  been
           awarded by the University.
       10. Mr Mangion accepted that there was no issue over the  fact  that
           the Respondent had been awarded the scholarships he relied  upon
           before the Judge. He noted that the Respondent had accepted that
           at the date of his application he had not been issued  with  any
           document to confirm the award of those scholarships, although he
           had been told that they would be awarded to him.
       11. Mr Mangion accepted that the Judge had correctly identified that
           taken in isolation the CAS had not  stated  the  true  financial
           position between the Respondent and the University that  existed
           at the date of decision.
       12. Mr Mangion also accepted that if the CAS  had  referred  to  the
           scholarship  then  the  application  would  have  been  granted,
           because the funds reflected in the Respondent's bank  statements
           were sufficient, and held for the requisite period, to cover the
           other elements of the "maintenance" requirement.
       13. Nevertheless Mr Mangion argued  that  the  Judge  had  not  been
           entitled to allow the appeal,  because  in  order  to  make  the
           findings of fact that he had made, he had admitted  inadmissible
           evidence into his consideration, and  had  failed  to  make  any
           reference to the provisions of s85A of the  2002  Act.  For  the
           Respondent to establish his argument, he had been forced to rely
           upon  documents  that  he  had  not  submitted  with   his   PBS
           application. There was nothing in the application itself, or  in
           the documents that supported it  that  could  have  alerted  the
           Appellant  to  the  existence  of  the  scholarships.  The  only
           question in  the  application  form  that  might  possibly  have
           alerted the decision maker to the existence of the  scholarships
           [p6 of 12] had  been  answered  in  the  negative,  although  he
           realistically conceded that this question did not directly raise
           the issue of  whether  a  scholarship  had  been  awarded  by  a
           student's prospective college.


      Paragraph 245AA


       14. Mr Mangion argued that the  terms  of  paragraph  245AA  of  the
           Immigration Rules were not engaged by the  application,  and  so
           the case worker was not required to contact the  Respondent  and
           invite him to  supplement  the  "specified  documents"  that  he
           had submitted in support of his application.
       15. Mr Mangion accepted that without the benefit of the  scholarship
           monies the evidence submitted by the Respondent  in  support  of
           the application was only deficient in the sense that it did  not
           demonstrate the requisite sums for one day within the  requisite
           28 day period. The relevant period is 31 July to 27 August 2014,
           and the calculation has been performed using the credit balances
           on the bank statements for the  three  different  bank  accounts
           that were supplied in support of the  application.  Nevertheless
           he argued, correctly, there was no "near  miss"  principle  that
           the Respondent could rely upon.


      The Respondent's submissions


       16. The Respondent argued out that he was the innocent victim  of  a
           failure by the University to set out in the CAS the scholarships
           that were awarded to him, and that  he  had  now  completed  the
           course for which he had  sought  leave  to  study,  because  the
           University had allowed him to do so whilst  the  appeal  process
           was ongoing. He had been informed that he  had  been  awarded  a
           distinction  in  his  dissertation,  and  that  if  he  were  in
           possession of leave to remain he would be able to  graduate  and
           attend the graduation ceremony in the UK. He  accepted  that  he
           could return to Pakistan in safety, and that he  could  graduate
           in his absence.
       17. The Respondent expressed the concern that if he sought to  study
           further outside Pakistan the refusal would affect him. Whilst he
           could return to Pakistan and apply for entry clearance to do  so
           he would now always have on his immigration record  the  refusal
           of a visa, and a removal decision,  which  he  considered  would
           unfairly blight his future prospects, since he found himself  in
           a position that was not of his own making.

      Error of Law?


       18. I am satisfied that the Judge did make an error of  law  in  his
           approach to the evidence that he  was  entitled  to  admit  when
           considering whether in the context of a PBS appeal, the claimant
           had demonstrated that he met the requirements of the Immigration
           Rules. He was not entitled to admit evidence that had  not  been
           supplied with the application, and thus he was not  entitled  to
           use documentary evidence of the award of the scholarships  which
           did not exist at the date of the application, and which were not
           supplied with it. In the circumstances I set aside the decision.


      The decision remade


       19. The evidence submitted in support of  the  application  did  not
           demonstrate  that  the  Respondent  met  the   requirements   of
           paragraph 245ZX(d) of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  period  in
           relation to the shortfall was extremely short, only one day, but
           there is no "near miss" principle that could save it.
       20. Nor was there anything about the documents submitted in  support
           of the  application  which  engaged  paragraph  245AA  and  thus
           obliged the case worker to contact the  Respondent  and  request
           further documents in the anticipation that  with  their  benefit
           the application would succeed.
       21. Nor did the rather  more  generous  2011  "process  instruction"
           survive the introduction of  paragraph  245AA;  Mandalia  [2015]
           UKSC 59 @ 28.
       22. In the circumstances I am not satisfied that the Respondent  has
           established that the case worker failed to follow any applicable
           policy when considering his application.
       23. The  Respondent  accepts  that  his  wife's  application  for  a
           variation of her own leave was also refused, and  that  her  own
           appeal  to  the  First  Tier  Tribunal  was  dismissed.  In  the
           circumstances, even if Article  8  is  engaged  by  the  removal
           decision under appeal I am satisfied that his ability  to  enjoy
           his "family life" with his wife is not affected by that decision
           - neither of them has any immigration status in the UK, and both
           of them are  able  to  return  together  to  Pakistan  to  their
           families in safety. Once in Pakistan the Respondent will be able
           to graduate in his absence from the University, and receive  the
           qualification  for  which  he  has  studied  and  satisfied  his
           examiners. He is not presently engaged in any  course  of  study
           and accepts that he has not yet decided what to do next with his
           career. He has identified no new course of study,  and  has  not
           been accepted onto any further course of study.
       24. I note the guidance to be found upon the proper  approach  to  a
           "private life" case in the decisions of Patel  [2013]  UKSC  72,
           and Nasim [2014] UKUT 25. The Respondent has  only  ever  had  a
           grant of temporary leave for purposes that are now complete. The
           following passage in Nasim sets out the relevant principles;
          14. Whilst the concept of a "family life"  is  generally  speaking
              readily identifiable, the concept of a "private life" for the
              purposes of Article 8 is inherently less clear. At one end of
              the "continuum" stands the  concept  of  moral  and  physical
              integrity  or  "physical  and  psychological  integrity"  (as
              categorised by the ECtHR in eg Pretty v United Kingdom (2002)
              35 EHRR 1) as  to  which,  in  extreme  instances,  even  the
              state's interest in  removing  foreign  criminals  might  not
              constitute a proportionate response. However,  as  one  moves
              down the continuum, one encounters aspects  of  private  life
              which, even if engaging Article 8(1) (if not alone,  then  in
              combination with other factors) are so far removed  from  the
              "core" of Article 8 as to  be  readily  defeasible  by  state
              interests, such as the importance of maintaining  a  credible
              and coherent system of immigration control.
           15. At this point on the continuum the essential elements of the
              private life relied upon will normally  be  transposable,  in
              the sense of being capable of replication in their  essential
              respects, following a person's return to their home  country.
              Thus, in headnote 3 of MM (Tier 1 PSW; Art 8;  private  life)
              Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 0037 we find that:-
               "3. When determining the issue  of  proportionality  ...  it
               will always be important  to  evaluate  the  extent  of  the
               individual's  social  ties  and  relationships  in  the  UK.
               However,  a  student  here  on  a  temporary  basis  has  no
               expectation of a right to remain in order to  further  these
               ties and relationships if the criteria of  the  points-based
               system are not met. Also, the character of  an  individual's
               "private life" relied upon is ordinarily by its very  nature
               of a type which can  be  formed  elsewhere,  albeit  through
               different social ties, after the individual is removed  from
               the UK."
           16.  As  was  stated  in  the  earlier  case  of  MG  (assessing
              interference with private life) Serbia and Montenegro  [2005]
              UKAIT 00113:-
               "A person's job and precise  programme  of  studies  may  be
               different in the country to which he is to be  returned  and
               his network of friendships and other acquaintances is likely
               to be different too, but his private life will  continue  in
               respect of all its essential elements."
           17. The difference between these types of "private life" case and
              a case founded on family life is instructive. As was noted in
              MM, the relationships involved in  a  family  life  are  more
              likely  to  be  unique,  so  as  to  be  incapable  of  being
              replicated once an  individual  leaves  the  United  Kingdom,
              leaving behind, for example,  his  or  her  spouse  or  minor
              child.
           18. In R (on the application of the Countryside Alliance)  v  AG
              and others [2007] UKHL 52, Lord Bingham, having described the
              concept of private life in Article 8 as "elusive", said that:
               "... the purpose of the article is in my view clear.  It  is
               to protect the individual against intrusion by agents of the
               state, unless for  good  reason,  into  the  private  sphere
               within which individuals expect to be left alone to  conduct
               their personal affairs and live their personal lives as they
               choose" [10].
           19. It is important to bear in  mind  that  the  "good  reason",
              which the state must invoke is not a fixity. British citizens
              may enjoy friendships, employment and studies that are in all
              essential respects the same as those enjoyed by persons  here
              who  are  subject  to  such  controls.  The  fact  that   the
              government  cannot  arbitrarily  interfere  with  a   British
              citizen's enjoyment of those things, replicable  though  they
              may be, and that, in practice, interference is likely  to  be
              justified only by strong reasons, such as imprisonment for  a
              criminal offence, cannot be used to restrict the government's
              ability to rely on the enforcement of immigration controls as
              a reason for interfering  with  friendships,  employment  and
              studies enjoyed by a person who  is  subject  to  immigration
              controls.
          20. We therefore agree with Mr  Jarvis  that  [57]  of  Patel  and
              Others is a significant exhortation from the Supreme Court to
              re-focus attention on the nature and  purpose  of  Article  8
              and, in particular, to recognise its limited  utility  to  an
              individual where one has moved along the continuum, from that
              Article's core  area  of  operation  towards  what  might  be
              described as its fuzzy penumbra. The limitation arises,  both
              from what will at  that  point  normally  be  the  tangential
              effect on the individual of  the  proposed  interference  and
              from the fact that, unless there are  particular  reasons  to
              reduce the public interest of enforcing immigration controls,
              that interest  will  consequently  prevail  in  striking  the
              proportionality  balance  (even  assuming   that   stage   is
              reached).
           21. In conclusion on this first general matter, we find that the
              nature of the right asserted by each of the appellants, based
              on their desire, as former students, to undertake a period of
              post-study work in the United  Kingdom,  lies  at  the  outer
              reaches of cases  requiring  an  affirmative  answer  to  the
              second of the five "Razgar" questions and that, even if  such
              an affirmative  answer  needs  to  be  given,  the  issue  of
              proportionality is to be resolved decisively in favour of the
              respondent, by reference to her functions as the guardian  of
              the system of  immigration  controls,  entrusted  to  her  by
              Parliament.
       25. To the extent that the Respondent relies upon his undoubted good
           character the following passage in Nasim is applicable;
          25. A further seam running through the appellant's submissions was
              that, during their time in the United Kingdom, they had  been
              law-abiding,  had  not  relied  on  public  funds   and   had
              contributed to the United Kingdom  economy  by  paying  their
              students' fees. Their aim  was  now  to  contribute  to  that
              economy by working.
           26. We do not consider that this set of  submissions  takes  the
              appellants' cases anywhere. It cannot rationally be contended
              that their Article 8 rights have been  made  stronger  merely
              because, during their time in this  country,  they  have  not
              sought public funds, have refrained from committing  criminal
              offences  and  have  paid  the  fees  required  in  order  to
              undertake their courses. Similarly,  a  desire  to  undertake
              paid employment in the United Kingdom  is  not,  as  such,  a
              matter that can enhance a person's right to  remain  here  in
              reliance on Article 8.
           27. The only significance of not having criminal convictions and
              not  having  relied  on  public  funds  is  to  preclude  the
              respondent from pointing to any public interest in respect of
              the appellants' removal, over and above the basic  importance
              of maintaining a firm  and  coherent  system  of  immigration
              control. However, for reasons we have already enunciated,  as
              a general matter that  public  interest  factor  is,  in  the
              circumstances of these cases, more than  adequate  to  render
              removal proportionate.
       26. To sum up then, the Respondent's appeal did not  rely  upon  the
           core concepts of moral and physical integrity. In  my  judgement
           the evidence placed before the  Judge  did  not  establish  that
           there were any compelling compassionate circumstances that meant
           the refusal to grant him leave, and the  consequential  decision
           to remove him, led to an unjustifiably  harsh  outcome.  In  the
           light of the provisions of s117A-D, and the guidance to be found
           in AM (s117A-D) Malawi [2015] UKUT 260 I am satisfied  that  the
           removal decision is a proportionate response  given  the  public
           interest in the maintenance of immigration controls.
       27. In the circumstances I remake the decision so as to dismiss  the
           appeal.


   DECISION


      The Determination of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated  on
      13 May 2015 did involve the making of an error of  law  that  requires
      that decision to be set aside and remade.


      I  remake  the  decision  so  as  to  dismiss  the  appeal  under  the
      Immigration Rules, and on Article 8 grounds.
