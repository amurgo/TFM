Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Chelvan instructed by South West Law
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. The appellant is a citizen of  the  Philippines  who  was  born  on  20
    October 1972.  On 8 December 1995,  the  appellant  married  a  British
    citizen,  Kevin  Draper,  at  the  Register  Office  in  Bristol.   The
    appellant and Mr Draper have a  daughter,  Rhian  who  was  born  on  3
    September 2000 in the UK.  She is also a British citizen.

 2. The appellant and Mr Draper lived  in  the  UK  between  May  1995  and
    October 1996.  In November 1996, they moved to Dubai  where  Mr  Draper
    went to work.  They lived  there  together  until  November  2011.   It
    appears that the appellant and Mr Draper returned to the  UK  regularly
    living on  his  narrow  boat  or  with  his  mother.   Of  course,  the
    appellant's daughter, Rhian was born in the UK on 3 September 2000.  In
    March 2011, Mr Draper and Rhian  returned  to  live  in  the  UK.   The
    appellant remained in Dubai until November 2011 when  she  returned  to
    the Philippines to look after her father who was ill.  The  appellant's
    mother had died in July 2011.

 3. It appears that the appellant visited the UK on  a  visit  visa.   Most
    recently on 31 January 2013, the appellant was granted entry  clearance
    as a visitor valid until 31 July 2013.  She arrived in  the  UK  on  28
    February 2013 using  that  entry  clearance.   On  23  July  2013,  the
    appellant applied for a variation of her leave on the  basis  that  she
    was the spouse of a British citizen in the UK.  On 11  September  2013,
    the Secretary of State refused  her  application  as  a  partner  of  a
    British citizen under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and  on  the
    basis of her private life under para 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules.
    In addition, the Secretary  of  State  concluded  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances to justify a grant of leave outside the Rules
    under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal

 4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In  her  notice  of
    appeal, the appellant requested that the appeal be  determined  on  the
    "papers".  As a consequence,  the  appellant's  appeal  was  determined
    without a hearing.  In a determination dated 24  February  2014,  Judge
    Sangha dismissed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules and
    Art 8 of the ECHR.  The appellant sought permission to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Permission was initially  refused  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Cruthers) on 19 March 2014  but,  following  a  renewed
    application to the Upper Tribunal, that Tribunal  (UTJ  Eshun)  granted
    the appellant permission to appeal on 30 April 2014.  The basis for the
    grant of permission was that:

         "It is arguable that the judge failed to carry  out  an  Article  8
         assessment having found that  the  appellant  did  not  qualify  to
         remain in the UK under the Article 8 provisions of the  Immigration
         Rules."

 5. The appeal before the Upper Tribunal was originally listed on  16  July
    2014 when the appellant did not appear and was  not  represented.   The
    Upper Tribunal (UTJ  Poole)  dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  in  a
    determination dated 23 July 2014.  Thereafter,  the  appellant's  (now)
    solicitors made an  application  to  set  aside  the  Upper  Tribunal's
    determination under rule 43 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) on the basis that  the  notice  of
    the hearing had not been received by  the  appellant.   On  14  January
    2015, UTJ Southern granted the appellant's application  and  set  aside
    the decision of the Upper Tribunal under rule 43.

 6. The appeal was relisted for hearing before me on 11 March 2015.

The Submissions

 7. At the hearing, I had the benefit of the grounds  of  appeal  from  the
    appellant, a rule 24 response dated 16 May 2014 from the respondent and
    a rule 25 reply from the appellant dated 9 March 2015.  In addition,  I
    heard detailed and careful submissions from Mr Chelvan, who represented
    the appellant and Mr Richards who represented the respondent.

 8. Mr Chelvan made two principal submissions.  First,  he  submitted  that
    the judge had failed properly to consider Art 8 outside the Immigration
    Rules.  He submitted that the judge had put the "cart before the horse"
    by considering Art 8 (if at all) at paras 19 - 22 of his  determination
    prior to considering an application of the Rules at paras 23 - 24.   Mr
    Chelvan submitted that was a material error of law  as  the  judge  was
    required to first consider whether the appellant met  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules  and  then,  if  the  appellant  did  not,  to
    consider whether  outside  the  Rules  a  breach  of  Art  8  had  been
    established.  Mr Chelvan relied upon the Court of Appeal  decisions  in
    MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Singh and  Khalid  v  SSHD
    [2015] EWCA Civ 74.

 9. Secondly, Mr Chelvan submitted that the judge had approached the  issue
    of whether the appellant could be expected to return to the Philippines
    to obtain entry clearance on a mistaken basis of  fact.   He  submitted
    that in para 20 when the judge had  considered  whether  the  appellant
    would be able to meet the financial requirements of the  Rules  he  had
    wrongly concluded on the basis of the application that Mr  Draper  (the
    sponsor) earned in excess of the required �18,600 gross per annum.   Mr
    Chelvan accepted that the mistake was that  of  the  sponsor,  who  had
    assisted the appellant in  completing  the  application  form,  but  he
    nevertheless submitted that this was a mistake of fact which flawed the
    judge's finding that the appellant could be expected to return  to  the
    Philippines to obtain entry clearance.   Mr  Chelvan  relied  upon  the
    Court of Appeal's decision in E & R v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ 49.

10. In addition, Mr Chelvan made reference to the fact that the  judge  did
    not appear to have fully  considered  the  "best  interests"  of  Rhian
    although, in response to a question from me, he  indicated  that  there
    was little material before the judge on this issue.

11. Mr Chelvan also drew my attention to a bundle  of  documents  which  he
    indicated  he  sought  permission  to  admit  in  the  Upper   Tribunal
    proceedings  under  rule  15(2A).   He  indicated  that  there  was   a
    considerable amount of fresh material relevant to the Art 8 issue which
    had not been submitted by the appellant in person to the judge.

12. On behalf of the respondent, Mr Richards submitted that the  judge  had
    properly considered Art 8.  The appellant could not succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules and had regard to all the salient facts at paras 19 -
    22.  He submitted  that  the  judge  was  entitled  to  find  that  the
    appellant could be expected to return to the Philippines to seek  entry
    clearance.  Mr Richards submitted that there was  no  mistake  of  fact
    amounting to an error of law.  The judge was entitled  to  believe  the
    evidence put forward by the appellant, and presented  to  him,  in  her
    application.

Discussion

13. I have considerable  misgivings  about  the  judge's  approach  to  the
    appellant's claim under Art 8.

14. Looking first at Mr Chelvan's first principal  submission,  it  is  not
    suggested  that  the  appellant  could  currently  succeed  under   the
    Immigration Rules as she is unable to "switch" from her  visitor  leave
    under Appendix FM to leave as a partner.  There was, therefore, no real
    issue for the judge as to whether the appellant met the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules.  At paras 23  -  27  he  made  that  finding  as
    follows:

         "23. In considering this case I have take into account the case  of
             Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).  The guidance in  Gulshan  is
             that the Rules are the starting  point  for  consideration  of
             Article 8 of the ECHR.  I  have  taken  full  account  of  the
             Respondent's view of the State's obligations under  Article  8
             of the ECHR set out in the Rules and in particular Appendix FM
             and Paragraph ADE of the Rules.

         24.  In my  assessment  of  the  evidence  it  is  clear  that  the
             Appellant does not meet the requirement  of  Appendix  FM  and
             Paragraph 276ADE of the Rules.  Whilst  the  Appellant  has  a
             genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner and a child
             in the UK, both of whom are British  citizens,  the  Appellant
             does not meet the eligibility requirements of the Rules and as
             held in Sabir (Appendix FM - EX.1  not  free-standing)  [2014]
             UKUT 00063 (IAC) paragraph EX.1 in Appendix FM is not a  free-
             standing "magic bullet"  for  determining  Article  8  claims.
             EX.1 is  not  a  free-standing  provision  and  therefore  the
             Appellant cannot benefit from  it.   Nor  does  the  Appellant
             benefit from the provisions of Paragraph 276ADE of the  Rules.
             There is nothing, in my assessment, to prevent  the  Appellant
             from returning to the Philippines in order to apply for  entry
             clearance to join her husband and daughter in the  UK  in  the
             normal proper manner."

    Mr Chelvan's argument was that these two concluding paragraphs  of  the
    judge's determination should have preceded any consideration of  Art  8
    rather than, as appears to have been the  case,  to  have  been  placed
    subsequent to that consideration in paras 19 - 22.

15. Before dealing with that submission,  I  should  set  out  the  judge's
    reasoning at paras 19 - 22 where he said this:

         "19. In my assessment of the evidence it seems that  the  Appellant
             has blatantly ignored the Immigration Rules.  Despite the fact
             that when the Appellant  applied  for  entry  clearance  as  a
             visitor and was asked why she was not applying for  settlement
             and having stated that she had a 78-year old  father  to  look
             after who suffered with depression and that she would only  be
             visiting the UK for 2 months to visit her daughter, she  then,
             in blatant disregard of the Immigration  Rules,  submitted  an
             application in July 2013 for Leave to Remain here.

         20.  In my assessment of the evidence there is nothing to stop  the
             Appellant from returning to the Philippines and  applying  for
             entry clearance to join her husband  and  her  daughter,  both
             British  citizens,  in  the  UK  for  settlement.   From   the
             information  provided  it  would  seem  that  the  Appellant's
             husband  would  satisfy  the  financial  requirements  of  the
             Immigration Rules as he earns more than �18,600 per annum  and
             indeed he is in  business  and  that  his  income  from  self-
             employment is over �50,000 per  annum  as  he  is  a  Managing
             Director  of  Christian  Grant  Ltd,  a  property  development
             company.   It  would  appear  that  the  Appellant  also   has
             considerable cash savings and therefore there is no reason why
             if the Appellant were to return to the Philippines  she  could
             not apply for entry clearance to join her husband and daughter
             in the UK.

         21.  If she chooses to do that she would only  suffer  a  temporary
             separation from her  husband  and  child  from  whom  she  was
             separated in any  event  between  2011  and  2013.   There  is
             nothing to stop her from maintaining contact with her  husband
             and child through modern channels of communication whilst  she
             returns to  the  Philippines  in  order  to  apply  for  entry
             clearance in the proper manner, just like  many  thousands  of
             other Immigrants choose to do in order to  join  their  spouse
             and family in the UK.  In my assessment there is  no  evidence
             before me to show that there are any insurmountable  obstacles
             for the Appellant herself  returning  to  the  Philippines  in
             order to apply for entry clearance.  Whilst I  note  that  the
             Appellant's husband's mother  is  91  years  of  age  and  the
             Appellant's husband is her registered carer that can continue.
              There is no question of the Appellant's  daughter  having  to
             leave the UK and she can continue at school and  carry  on  at
             the Bristol Adventure Sea Cadets as she is doing now.

         22.  In the circumstances I come to the conclusion that it would be
             appropriate  in  the  circumstances  of  this  case  for   the
             Appellant to return to the Philippines in order to  apply  for
             entry clearance to rejoin her husband and child in the UK.   I
             have come to the conclusion  that  there  are  no  exceptional
             circumstances in this particular case why the Appellant cannot
             return  to  the  Philippines  in  order  to  apply  for  entry
             clearance in the normal manner.  There does not appear  to  be
             any unjustifiably harsh consequences for either the Appellant,
             her husband or the child  of  the  family  why  the  Appellant
             cannot return to the Philippines in order to apply  for  entry
             clearance in the normal  manner  and  nor  that  it  would  be
             disproportionate  to  do  so  in  the  circumstances  of  this
             particular case.  I say this particularly in view of the  fact
             that the Appellant when she  was  interviewed  for  her  entry
             clearance visa as a visitor said that she was only coming here
             for a period of 2 months."

16. The structure of decision making under Art 8 as a result  of  the  "new
    Rules" and the new Part 5A of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 is that: (1) a judge should first decide whether an individual
    meets the requirements of any of the relevant Immigration Rules.  If he
    does, then the individual succeeds under the  Rules;  and  (2)  if  the
    individual does not succeed, the judge should go on to consider whether
    the individual succeeds outside the Immigration Rules on the  basis  of
    Art 8.  That structure of decision making is sanctioned by the Court of
    Appeal in MF (Nigeria) and in Singh  and  Khalid.   Engaging  in,  what
    might he called, that second stage, there is no "threshold" requirement
    of arguability (see MM (Lebanon) v SSHD [2004] EWCA Civ  985  at  [128]
    and R (Aliyu and Aliyu) v SSHD [2014] EWHC  3919  (Admin)).   In  every
    case there must be a consideration of the individual claim outside  the
    Rules although the  extent  of  that  consideration  will  depend  upon
    particular circumstances, for example the extent to which  the  factors
    relied upon by an individual have already  been  considered  under  the
    Rules (see, for example Aliyu and Aliyu at [59]).

17. Consequently, in carrying out the assessment at  the  second  stage,  a
    judge must already have completed the first stage and  determined  that
    the individual does not meet the requirements of the Rules.

18. Although Judge Sangha's consideration of Art 8 in fact  occurs  in  the
    four preceding paragraphs (19 - 22) to his  explicit  consideration  of
    the Rules at paras 23 - 24, that in itself is not fatal to  his  Art  8
    assessment providing that in determining the  proportionality  question
    he had in mind that the appellant did not meet the requirements of  the
    Rules.  If - and I emphasise the word "if" -  Judge  Sangha  had  fully
    considered the issue of  proportionality  in  paras  19  -  22  of  his
    determination, I would not be persuaded that  the  mere  fact  that  he
    turned to his finding on  the  Rules  at  paras  23  -  24  (which  was
    inevitably on  the  facts)  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the  Rules,  meant  that  on  a  fair  reading  of  his
    determination he did not have that finding in mind  when  reaching  his
    adverse conclusion on proportionality.

19. The difficulty with Judge Sangha's determination is, in my  view,  that
    paras 19 - 22 are not  a  full  and  proper  consideration  of  Art  8.
    Although Mr Chelvan's principal oral argument was that  the  judge  had
    put "the cart before the horse", both the grounds and his oral argument
    touched upon, and raised, the more general  legal  point  (albeit  with
    less specificity) that the judge had  not  properly  considered  Art  8
    outside the Rules.  That general point, as I have already noted  above,
    was indeed the basis upon which UTJ Eshun granted permission.

20. The reason why, in my view, Judge Sangha's Art 8 assessment at paras 19
    to 22 is inadequate in law is that the judge  nowhere  decides  whether
    the appellant's removal to live in the Philippines would breach Art  8.
    The only issue which the  judge  determined  was  that  her  "temporary
    separation" from her husband and child in order to gain entry clearance
    would not breach Art 8.

21. That issue only arose, in my judgment,  if  it  would  otherwise  be  a
    breach of Art 8 to remove the appellant to  live  in  the  Philippines.
    That question would  involve,  for  example,  whether  the  appellant's
    British citizen husband and child could reasonably be expected to  live
    there with her or, if they could not, whether the necessary  separation
    was a sufficiently serious interference with her family life to  breach
    Art 8.  I cannot detect any findings in the  judge's  determination  on
    that issue.

22. If, however, that would breach Art 8  the  subsidiary  question  arises
    whether to require the appellant to "temporarily"  return  to  her  own
    country to obtain entry clearance - potentially a  lesser  interference
    with her family life - would be proportionate and, therefore, no breach
    of Art 8 established.  That latter issue, (sometimes referred to as the
    Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 point), was the sole issue considered  by  the
    judge in paras 19 - 22.

23. It is clear that it will be a  disproportionate  interference  with  an
    individual's private and family life simply to return them to their own
    country to obtain  entry  clearance  unless  there  is  some  "sensible
    reason" for doing so (see SSHD v Treebhowan; and Hayat  v  SSHD  [2012]
    EWCA Civ 1054 at [30]).  It will,  therefore,  generally  be  wrong  to
    dismiss or refuse an Art 8 claim simply on  the  procedural  ground  of
    requiring an individual to seek entry clearance.  In this case,  it  is
    far from clear to me that the judge approached the Chikwamba issue on a
    proper basis.  At para 22 he appears to conflate the issue  of  whether
    there were any "exceptional circumstances" or whether  there  would  be
    "any unjustifiably harsh consequences" - tests relevant to the ultimate
    issue of whether Art 8 is breached - with the question of  whether  the
    appellant could be required to return to the Philippines to seek  entry
    clearance.  What the judge should have considered was, instead, whether
    there was any "sensible reason" for doing so.  It is true that at  para
    19, the judge refers to the appellant as having "blatantly ignored" the
    Immigration Rules and having come to the UK as a  visitor  "in  blatant
    disregard of  the  Immigration  Rules",  submitted  an  application  to
    remain.  It is entirely unclear to me upon what basis that  finding  is
    made and what evidence there was to support it.  At one  point  in  his
    submissions, Mr Richards referred to the judge as having found that the
    appellant had practised a "deception".  He did not  pursue  that  point
    and was, in my judgment, right not to do so.  The only evidence  before
    the judge was that the appellant had come to the UK to visit her family
    and then, having been here for  two  months,  made  an  application  to
    remain under Appendix FM.  In doing so she  neither  blatantly  ignored
    the Immigration Rules (as she sought to  change  the  lawful  basis  on
    which she is in the  UK)  nor  was  it  in  blatant  disregard  of  the
    Immigration Rules since nothing prevented her from seeking to vary  her
    leave albeit without any prospect  of  success  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  It cannot, in my judgment, be properly regarded  as  a  blatant
    disregard or ignorance of the Immigration Rules to seek to remain under
    Art 8 in these circumstances.  Nothing in  the  evidence  entitled  the
    judge to infer that the appellant had deliberately come to the UK as  a
    visitor while secretly intending to seek to remain  or  settle  as  the
    partner of her spouse.  That is tantamount to an  allegation  of  fraud
    and would require cogent evidence which I  am  wholly  unpersuaded  was
    before the judge.

24. Consequently, in my view,  the  judge  has  erred  in  law  by  failing
    properly to consider Art 8 both in  reaching  a  view  on  whether  the
    appellant's removal to the Philippines would, in itself, breach  Art  8
    and, if it would, whether it would  nevertheless  be  proportionate  to
    expect the appellant to seek entry clearance.

25. That is sufficient to legally flaw the Judge's decision under Art 8.

26. Mr Chelvan also relied upon the mistaken basis upon which the judge had
    concluded that the separation would only  be  "temporary"  because  the
    appellant would succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules,  in  particular
    because she would meet the financial requirements  of  the  Rules.   Mr
    Chelvan submitted that that was in fact not the case  and  the  mistake
    arose because of the way  in  which  the  sponsor  had  unintentionally
    completed  the  application   form   misunderstanding   the   financial
    requirements of Appendix FM based on his business  income  and  assets.
    Whilst I accept that a mistake of fact is capable of being an error  of
    law, I am far from satisfied that the mistake in this  case  qualifies.
    In E & R the Court of Appeal set out the requirement at [66].  Carnwath
    LJ said this:

         "First, there must have been a mistake  as  to  an  existing  fact,
         including a mistake  as  to  the  availability  of  evidence  on  a
         particular issue.  Secondly, the fact or evidence  must  have  been
         'established',  in  the  sense  that  it  was   uncontentious   and
         objectively verifiable.  Thirdly, the appellant (or  his  advisors)
         must not have been responsible  for  the  mistake.   Fourthly,  the
         mistake must have played a material (not necessarily decisive) part
         in the Tribunal's reasoning."

27. It seems to me that the third requirement that the mistake must not  be
    the responsibility of the appellant cannot be satisfied  in  this  case
    despite Mr Chelvan's spirited submission that the appellant and sponsor
    were legally unrepresented and did not understand what was required  of
    them in the application form.  Whilst the Court of  Appeal  in  E  &  R
    recognised  that  a  certain  degree  of  flexibility  is  required  in
    international protection cases, in my view, a judge is entitled to rely
    upon evidence put forward by an appellant (particularly  in  a  "paper"
    appeal where there is no possibility of further enquiry by the judge of
    the appellant) and the risk lies with the appellant  if  inaccurate  or
    mistaken information is provided.  In my judgment, nothing  in  E  &  R
    requires that I take a different view.

28. In any event, since for the reasons I have already  given  the  judge's
    decision under Art 8 cannot stand, there will be opportunity to correct
    the mistake when the appeal is reheard.

Decision and Disposal

29. For these reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal under Art 8 involved the making of an  error  of
    law.  That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

30. Given the extent and nature of the fact-finding required in relation to
    Art 8, and having regard to para 7.2 of the Practice Statements of  the
    Senior President, it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-
    tier  Tribunal,  as  I  understand  it,  was  also  the  view  of  both
    representatives if the appellant's appeal in  the  Upper  Tribunal  was
    successful.  None of the findings will be preserved.

31. Accordingly, the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  an
    oral hearing de novo by a judge other than Judge Sangha.

                                                                     A Grubb
