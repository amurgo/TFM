For the Respondent:    Ms S. Zorah of Unican Law Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   For the sake of continuity I will refer to the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

2.   The appellant appealed  against  the  respondent's  decision  dated  03
    November 2014 to refuse leave to enter by way  of  cancelling  existing
    leave to enter. First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer allowed the appeal  in
    a decision promulgated on 28 April 2015. The Upper Tribunal  set  aside
    the decision and remitted it to the First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing in a decision promulgated on 26 October 2015.

3.   First-tier Tribunal Judge Somal ("the judge") allowed the appeal  in  a
    decision promulgated on 12 April 2016. The respondent sought to  appeal
    the decision on the following grounds:

      i) The First-tier Tribunal made no reference to the  ETS  spreadsheet,
         which taken together  with  the  other  evidence  produced  by  the
         respondent was sufficient to show that  the  ETS  English  language
         certificate was obtained by deception.

     ii) The judge failed to follow the approach outlined in SSHD V  Shehzad
         & Another [2016] EWCA Civ 615: see also SM & Qadir  v  SSHD  [2016]
         UKUT 00229.

4.   Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara granted permission to appeal in a  decision
    dated 28 September 2016 in the following terms:

         "It is unclear  whether  the  original  grounds  are  relied  upon.
         However, the renewed grounds argue that the judge made no reference
         to the ETS spreadsheet which showed that  the  appellant's  English
         language test had been invalidated. This is  indeed  the  case  and
         this, arguably, amounts to a material error of law by itself. It is
         further arguable that owing to her lack  of  consideration  of  the
         said spreadsheet, the judge did not appreciate that the  burden  of
         proof shifted to the appellant to raise an innocent explanation: SM
         & Qadir v SSHD (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 00229
         (IAC)."

Decision and reasons

5.   After having considered the grounds of  appeal  and  oral  arguments  I
    satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision  did  not  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

6.   It is clear from paragraphs 7-13 of the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision
    that the judge considered all of the material evidence relied  upon  by
    both parties. She confirmed that the appellant relied upon his  witness
    statement and gave evidence without the assistance  of  an  interpreter
    [7]. She summarised the reasons given for cancelling  leave  to  enter,
    which included (i) the fact that ETS cancelled the test  results;  (ii)
    the appellant's apparent reluctance  to  produce  and  explain  certain
    documents he brought with him to an investigatory interview; and  (iii)
    the fact that Nottingham Trent University withdrew  sponsorship  on  26
    September  2014  [8].  The  judge  went  on  to  consider  the  witness
    statements of Peter Millington  and  Rebecca  Collings  but  noted  the
    generic nature  of  those  statements,  which  did  not  refer  to  the
    appellant or the specific testing centre [9-10].  She  also  summarised
    the main contents of the Home Office report "Project Faï¿½ade -  criminal
    inquiry into abuse of the  TOEIC:  Premier  Language  Training  Centre,
    Barking" [11].

7.   The judge also  took  into  account  evidence  she  referred  to  as  a
    "printout" [10]:

         "A printout that appears to be a printout of an  ETS  search  gives
         the Appellants name and date of birth, the test centre  as  Premier
         Language and Training Centre and test date as 19 September 2012. It
         records invalid next to his name."

8.   At the hearing the parties agreed that  the  only  document  that  this
    could refer to was the document variously referred to as  a  "printout"
    or "spreadsheet". The document itself is headed "ETS SEARCH"  and  then
    states "ETS SELT SOURCE DATA". This is  a  common  source  of  evidence
    produced in similar cases, which was referred to by the Court of Appeal
    in Shehzad as "the ETS Lookup Tool" [25].

9.   Having outlined the evidence produced by the respondent the judge  went
    on to consider  the  evidence  put  forward  by  the  appellant,  which
    included previous English  test  results,  evidence  to  show  that  he
    studied at Nottingham Trent International College as well  as  evidence
    to show that Notting Trent University decided to reinstate his  student
    sponsorship on 04 November  2014  "following  further  discussion  with
    UKVI" [12]. The judge took into account the appellant's explanation for
    the information he took with him to  interview  regarding  ETS  testing
    [13].

10.  It seems clear from this summary of the evidence that, contrary to  the
    grounds of appeal and the grant of permission, the judge  did  consider
    the  "ETS  spreadsheet"  which  confirmed  invalidation  of  the   test
    certificate. It was  taken  into  account  along  with  other  evidence
    produced by the respondent. In her final  conclusions  the  judge  said
    that she found the appellant to be a credible witness. She  found  that
    he had given a credible explanation for the documents in his possession
    at the interview following advice from his lawyer. She did not consider
    his possession of those documents to be "of any concern" regarding  his
    overall credibility [14-15].

11.  The judge directed herself to the correct law relating to the  relevant
    burden and standard of proof regarding deception [16].  Having  already
    noted that the generic witness statements produced  by  the  respondent
    did not name the appellant she concluded:

         "17. The witness statements submitted by the Home Office  are  only
         evidence of the possibility that he was a  person  who  might  have
         used a proxy test taker but I find the documents do  not  establish
         that it was more likely than not that he was such a person. I  find
         the documents do not in any way establish this Appellant  has  used
         deception in his English language test. I find there is no credible
         evidence before me to indicate this Appellant was  not  the  person
         who took the test. I  find  the  respondents  allegation  that  the
         Appellant  has  submitted  false  information  in  the  form  of  a
         fraudulent  English  language  certificate  and  therefore  he  has
         attempted to obtain leave by deception has not been established. He
         has been adamant he sat the test; he  had  already  passed  English
         tests, studied in English before he sat the test and spoke  English
         before me.

         18.  He has made no false representations. He had no reason to  use
         deception as he already spoke English having passed an English test
         in 2010, studied in English before taking his TOEIC 2  years  later
         after his English had  further  improved.  It  is  clear  from  the
         letters from Nottingham Trent University, his Tier 4 sponsor having
         initially withdrawn his place whilst  the  UKVI  investigation  was
         pending, since then the university had on-going talks with UKVI  as
         a result of which they reinstated his sponsorship. He does not  fit
         the profile of a person whose English language skills were such  as
         to require him to use a proxy because there was  evidence  that  he
         already had necessary English language [skills] and  had  completed
         studies in the UK. The mere fact  that  the  Home  Office  provides
         evidence that ETS has invalidated a certificate is  not  enough  to
         show fraud.  It  is  obvious  that  a  test  certificate  might  be
         invalidated for reasons unrelated to a person using  a  proxy  test
         taker. I find there has not been such  a  change  in  circumstances
         since leave was given that it should be cancelled."

12.  The nature and extent of fraud undertaken in certain ETS  test  centres
    is still the subject of ongoing  investigation.  Since  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made the decision in April 2016 the decisions in  SM  &  Qadir
    and Shehzad outlined further developments. Neither  case  purported  to
    put forward any binding formula for the assessment of individual cases.
    The most recent decision in  MA  (ETS  -  TOEIC  testing)  [2016]  UKUT
    00450(IAC) emphasised the intrinsically fact sensitive  nature  of  the
    assessment of whether a person produced a fraudulently obtained English
    language certificate.

13.  The Tribunal in SM & Qadir found a number of weaknesses in the  generic
    evidence put  forward  by  Collings  and  Millington  but  nevertheless
    concluded that it was likely to be sufficient to discharge the  initial
    evidential burden of proof. The evidential burden then  shifts  to  the
    appellant to  provide  an  innocent  explanation  in  response  to  the
    allegation.

14.  I am satisfied that the judge took the correct approach in  this  case.
    She considered the material evidence put forward by the respondent  and
    was entitled to take into account the  fact  that  it  was  generic  in
    nature. She clearly took into account the "ETS Lookup tool" spreadsheet
    and the fact that ETS  had  invalidated  the  test  result.  Given  the
    criticisms of some of the generic evidence I find that it was  open  to
    the judge to conclude that the evidence  only  raised  the  possibility
    that the appellant was a person who might have used a proxy test taker.
    As a matter of fact, she then went on to consider whether the appellant
    had provided an innocent explanation in response to the allegation.  It
    was open to her to take into account the  matters  that  she  did.  She
    heard  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  was  able  to  assess   his
    credibility in light of the other evidence he produced in  response  to
    the allegation.

15.  After having taken into account the evidence as a whole, the judge  was
    satisfied  that  the  respondent's  evidence  was  not  sufficient   to
    discharge the overall legal burden of proof. Those findings  were  open
    to the judge to make on the evidence. The respondent disagrees with the
    decision but the judge's findings were within  a  range  of  reasonable
    responses to the evidence.

16.  The First-tier Tribunal decision did  not  involve  the  making  of  an
    error on a point of law. The decision shall stand.
