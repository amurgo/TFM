                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr K Ahmed
For the Respondent:    Ms Z Kiss


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


         1. The appellant's appeal against the First-tier Tribunal decision
            that it did not  have  jurisdiction  to  determine  his  appeal
            against a decision of the respondent dated 18th  February  2017
            refusing him a family permit must fail.


         2. Although there were errors in the decision of  the  respondent,
            the respondent cannot grant a statutory right of  appeal  where
            one does not exist.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  and  the  Upper
            Tribunal are  creatures  of  statute  and  cannot  determine  a
            statutory appeal where one does not exist.

         3.  In  this  case,  the  decision  to  refuse   the   appellant's
            application for a family permit was taken under the Immigration
            (European Economic Are) Regulations 2016; there is no right  of
            appeal against such decisions.


         4. There is no material error of law in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
            decision.



 Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.


     I do not set  aside  the  decision;  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal stands.

                                    Date 5th October 2018
