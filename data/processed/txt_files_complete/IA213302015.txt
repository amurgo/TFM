Representation:
For the Appellant:           Mr V Sharkey (MediVisas UK LLP)
For the Respondent:        Ms J Isherwood (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
       of 17 November 2016 dismissing his appeal  against  the  decision  to
       refuse his application on human rights grounds of 21 May 2015.


    2. The immigration history given for the Appellant is  that  he  entered
       the UK as a visitor and was granted extensions of leave as a  student
       or student nurse until 30 November 2003. He then overstayed his leave
       and next came to light when he made an application  as  an  unmarried
       partner based on a same sex relationship;  that  was  refused  on  17
       December 2008, and he was served notice of being present  unlawfully.
       He left the country and returned on 1 July 2009 with entry  clearance
       until 13 October 2011. A further application was refused outside  the
       Rules, but on 13 December 2011 he was granted Discretionary Leave  to
       Remain based on his relationship with his partner.


    3. The application from which this  appeal  springs  was  based  on  the
       Appellant's gender preference as a gay man and his HIV status,  which
       he relied upon as relevant to his  claim  that  he  would  face  very
       significant  obstacles   to   integration   in   Jamaica   and/or   a
       disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights. At the  time
       of the application he made no claim based on any relationship with  a
       "significant other".


    4. The refusal letter found that the Appellant faced no very significant
       obstacles to integration in Jamaica given he had resided there for 27
       years before entering the UK; he had the advantage  of  speaking  the
       language. There were no exceptional  circumstances  present,  as  the
       drugs he relied on for his HIV treatment were reportedly available in
       Jamaica and a person would not be at risk there for reasons of  their
       sexuality alone.


    5. On 3 June 2015 the Appellant lodged a notice of appeal,  noting  that
       he had lived in the UK for 13 years, and in  Jamaica  for  19  rather
       than 27 years of his life.  As shown by the Respondent's own guidance
       and the decision in JR Jamaica, a homosexual living openly would face
       inhuman and degrading treatment in Jamaica; his health represented  a
       barrier to his return.


    6. Before the First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant put forward  a  witness
       statement, now raising the issue of his cohabitation with his  fiancï¿½
       Dean Holliday with who he had been  in  a  relationship  since  April
       2015.  Mr  Holliday  provided  a  detailed  statement  regarding  the
       development and depth of their relationship.


    7. In a very short  decision,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the
       Appellant's appeal. As to his relationship with Mr Holliday, it found
       that this was a "new matter" unheralded hitherto in  the  Appellant's
       application, grounds of  appeal  or  via  any  one-stop  notice,  and
       accordingly  it  could  proceed  only  with   permission   from   the
       Respondent, which had not been forthcoming,  or  via  an  application
       direct to the Home Office. As to the Appellant's concerns about risks
       arising to him in Jamaica, that could be advanced only via the making
       of a protection claim. As to his case on  integration  otherwise,  "I
       find the Appellant may experience difficulties but I do not find they
       amount to very significant obstacles."


    8. Grounds of appeal argued that there  had  been  inadequate  reasoning
       given on the question of very significant obstacles  to  integration,
       and  that  there  was  no  procedural  inhibition  to   the   partner
       relationship being considered on the appeal within the scope of  Rule
       276ADE. Homosexuality was  only  one  dimension  of  the  Appellant's
       private life claim and its relevance to his future  life  in  Jamaica
       should have been evaluated within the ambit of the present appeal.


    9. In a Rule 23  notice  the  Secretary  of  State  contended  that  the
       decision was lawful and the judge had been quite right to  raise  the
       absent of consent to a new issue proceeding on appeal.


   10. Ms Isherwood provided me  with  a  helpful  attendance  note  of  the
       hearing from Mr Henry of counsel who had represented the Secretary of
       State below, in which he summarised the submissions  of  the  parties
       and the oral evidence, and any documents submitted  at  the  hearing.
       There is no indication there that the First-tier Tribunal or Mr Henry
       raised the issue of consent for a new matter  to  be  raised  at  the
       hearing.


   11.  For  the  Appellant  Ms  Sharkey  submitted  that  the   Appellant's
       relationship fell within the ambit of the grounds of appeal as it was
       apt for consideration under Rule 276ADE(vi) and thus consent was  not
       required.


   12. Ms Isherwood replied that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  reasoning  on
       integration was lawful if rather concise, and that consent to raising
       a new issue would not have been given if  it  had  been  sought.  She
       acknowledged that the Home Office guidance on the giving  of  consent
       warranted consideration when the question of consent to raise  a  new
       issue arose in the First-tier Tribunal.  She  accepted  that  it  was
       difficult to resist the conclusion that something had  miscarried  in
       the appeal  so  far,  given  that  very  little  of  the  Appellant's
       substantive case had actually been considered below.


Findings and reasons

   13. The relevant Immigration Rules are those in Rule 276ADE. I cite  only
       the relevant passages given that no questions arise of suitability.


         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life
         276ADE. The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
         date of application, the applicant: ...
         (vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK
         for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         there would be very significant obstacles to the applicant's
         integration into the country to which he would have to go if
         required to leave the UK."


   14. As stated by Sales LJ in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813, the  concept  of
       integration


         "is not confined to the mere ability to find a job  or  to  sustain
         life while living in the other country. It is  not  appropriate  to
         treat the statutory language as subject to some gloss and  it  will
         usually be sufficient for a court  or  tribunal  simply  to  direct
         itself in the terms that Parliament has chosen to use. The idea  of
         "integration" calls for a broad evaluative judgment to be  made  as
         to whether the individual will be enough of an insider in terms  of
         understanding how life in the society  in  that  other  country  is
         carried on and a capacity to participate in it, so  as  to  have  a
         reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to  operate
         on a day-to-day basis in that society and  to  build  up  within  a
         reasonable time a variety of human relationships to give  substance
         to the individual's private or family life."


   15. The Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 sets out:


         "82 Right of appeal to the Tribunal
         (1) A person ("P") may appeal to the Tribunal where- ...
         (b) the Secretary of State has decided to  refuse  a  human  rights
         claim made by P, ...
         84 Grounds of appeal
         ...
         (2) An appeal under  section  82(1)(b)  (refusal  of  human  rights
         claim) must be brought on the ground that the decision is  unlawful
         under section 6  of the Human Rights Act 1998.
         85 Matters to be considered
         (1) An appeal under section  82(1)  against  a  decision  shall  be
         treated by  [the  Tribunal  as  including  an  appeal  against  any
         decision in respect of which the appellant has a  right  of  appeal
         under section 82(1).
         (2) If an appellant under section 82(1)  makes  a  statement  under
         section 120 , the Tribunal  shall consider any matter raised in the
         statement which constitutes a ground of appeal of a kind listed  in
         section 84 against the decision appealed against.
         (3) Subsection (2) applies to a statement made  under  section  120
         whether the statement was made  before  or  after  the  appeal  was
         commenced.
         (4) On an  appeal  under  section  82(1)  against  a  decision  the
         Tribunal may consider any matter which it thinks  relevant  to  the
         substance of the decision, including a  matter  arising  after  the
         date of the decision.
         (5) But the Tribunal must not consider  a  new  matter  unless  the
         Secretary of State has given the Tribunal consent to do so.
         (6) A matter is a "new matter" if-
         (a) it constitutes a ground of appeal of a kind listed  in  section
         84, and
         (b) the Secretary of State has not previously considered the matter
         in the context of-
         (i) the decision mentioned in section 82(1), or
         (ii) a statement made by the appellant under section 120."


   16. As set out above, the Appellant made a human rights claim  predicated
       on his difficulties in integrating on a return to Jamaica because  of
       his gender preference  and  health  problems.  By  the  time  of  the
       hearing, he wished to add another dimension to his arguments based on
       private and family life grounds,  namely  his  relationship  with  Mr
       Holliday.


   17. Ms Isherwood contends this was a "new  matter",  essentially  on  the
       basis that the Appellant's wish to raise a family  life  rather  than
       private life argument represents a Human Rights Convention matter and
       is thus "a  ground  of  appeal  listed  in  section  84"  which  "the
       Secretary of State has not previously  considered"  in  any  context.
       Accordingly it could proceed only with the consent of the  Respondent
       to the appeal. The question of consent was not raised and, having not
       been considered, could not be said to have been given.


   18. On the other hand, Ms Sharkey argues that this was not a new  matter:
       a section 84 ground of appeal had been raised, viz that the  decision
       was unlawful when measured against section 6 of the Human Rights  Act
       1998 which demands compliance with the protections found  within  the
       European Convention on Human Rights, and that personal  relationships
       were apt for consideration within the ambit of an appeal arising from
       a refusal of an application made under Rule 276ADE(vi).


   19. I do not think it is necessary  to  resolve  the  relatively  complex
       issues raised by those competing submissions, because the decision of
       the First-tier Tribunal is  clearly  flawed  for  other  reasons.  In
       short,  insufficient  reasons  have  been  given  for   the   Judge's
       conclusion as to the Appellant's ability to  integrate  back  in  his
       country of origin.


   20. When one bears in mind the length of time that the Appellant has been
       out of Jamaica throughout his life, the limited  connections  he  can
       realistically be assumed to have  there,  and  his  sexual  identity,
       there was clearly a substantial case to be considered as  to  whether
       he would be able to negotiate life in Jamaica in the sense  of  being
       an "insider", to use the parlance of Sales LJ in Kamara.


   21. In the proceedings that culminated in the decision of  the  Court  of
       Appeal in JR Jamaica [2014] EWCA Civ  477,  the  Secretary  of  State
       conceded before the First-tier Tribunal that a homosexual who  wished
       to live openly as such would be at  risk  of  inhuman  and  degrading
       treatment  upon  return  to  Jamaica.  That   concession   does   not
       necessarily bind her in other cases, but it plainly demonstrates that
       a gay man will not necessarily find it possible to  integrate  there.
       It is no answer to such a claim to baldly state that it  can  proceed
       only via the making of  a  protection  claim.  That  route  might  be
       appropriate for a person who maintains that  their  fears  reach  the
       persecution threshold in Jamaica, but  risks  of  physical  harm  and
       discrimination  must  also  be  relevant  to   the   possibility   of
       integration and to the  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of  the
       interference with a removee's private life.


   22. The authorities recognise that reasons must be  given  for  both  the
       determination of the appeal and the material findings  of  fact  upon
       which that decision is based and they must be provided in  sufficient
       detail to "enable the reader to know  what  conclusion  the  decision
       maker has reached on the principal controversial issues":   see  Lord
       Bridge in Save Britain's Heritage v No 1 Poultry  Ltd  [1991]  1  WLR
       153. The brief rejection of the Appellant's case in this  respect  in
       the Tribunal below does not meet this standard.


   23. Accordingly the appeal should be reheard.


   24. As to the question of the Appellant's relationship with Mr  Holliday,
       doubtless his representatives will take  advantage  of  the  learning
       process that this appeal has enabled in order to ensure that this  is
       properly raised as an issue that the  Tribunal  should  consider.  An
       Appellant who fails to give adequate notice of a critical  new  issue
       clearly courts the possibility of their appeal miscarrying given  the
       strictures of section 85  of  the  NIAA  2002.  It  is  open  to  the
       Appellant to raise this relationship via  a  section  120  "one  stop
       notice" at which point the Secretary of State will have  to  consider
       whether or not to consent to the matter being raised.


   25. The Secretary of  State's  guidance  Rights  of  appeal  Version  3.0
       addressing this issue (attached) makes it  clear  that  a  Presenting
       Officer  faced  with  a  post-decision  development   that   arguably
       constitutes a "new matter" should make "every effort" to ensure  that
       the matter  receives  consideration  before  a  hearing,  seeking  an
       adjournment if necessary:

           "If a 'new matter' is raised before an appeal hearing, for
           example in the grounds of appeal, the SSHD should try to
           consider the matter before the appeal hearing. Every effort
           should be made to consider and decide the new matter before the
           appeal hearing so that consent can be given and the tribunal can
           consider all matters relating to that appellant in a single
           appeal.
           ...
           In order to make best use of tribunal resources, an adjournment
           should be sought for the SSHD to consider the new matter. Where
           possible, a single appeal should consider all matters that have
           been raised by the appellant."


   26. Guidance of this nature should be brought to  the  attention  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal by the Secretary of State,  see  Lord  Wilson  in
       Mandalia [2015] UKSC 59 at 19:


           "irrespective of whether the specialist judge might reasonably
           be expected himself to have been aware of it, the Home Office
           Presenting Officer clearly failed to discharge his duty to draw
           it to the tribunal's attention as policy of the agency which was
           at least arguably relevant ...."


   27. This is not an appeal where there are meaningful findings upon  which
       the Upper Tribunal can build, and thus it is allowed  to  the  extent
       that it is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.


          Decision:

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contain material errors of law.
    The appeal is remitted for hearing afresh.


 Signed:                                           Date: 7 July 2017
