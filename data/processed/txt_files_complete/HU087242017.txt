                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

 1. The appellant is a Pakistani national who was born on 7  January  1982.
    He appeals, with leave granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan,
    against a decision which was issued by First-tier Tribunal Judge Khawar
    on29 October 2019.   By  that  decision,  Judge  Khawar  ("the  judge")
    dismissed the appellant's human rights appeal against the  respondent's
    refusal of his application for Indefinite Leave to Remain on grounds of
    Long Residence.

Background

 2. The appellant entered the United Kingdom on 26 July 2006, holding entry
    clearance as a student.  He was granted subsequent periods of leave  up
    to 9 May 2016.  Before that date,  he  applied  for  further  leave  to
    remain and, on accruing ten years' continuous residence, he varied that
    application to one for ILR, under paragraph  276B  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 3. There was a single ground of refusal, which was that the respondent had
    concluded that it was undesirable to permit the appellant to remain  in
    the United Kingdom as a result of his conduct, under  paragraph  322(5)
    of the Immigration Rules.  She had reached that conclusion  because  of
    discrepancies between the earnings claimed by the appellant in previous
    applications for leave to remain and those disclosed to  Her  Majesty's
    Revenue and Customs ("HMRC") for the same periods.  The  appellant  had
    made applications for leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant  in
    2011 and 2013 and  the  earnings  claimed  in  those  applications  was
    significantly higher than  the  earnings  disclosed  to  HMRC  for  tax
    purposes.  The respondent concluded that the appellant  had  sought  to
    deceive the Home Office or the Revenue and that this was conduct  which
    rendered his continued presence in the UK undesirable.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 4. The appellant appealed, and his appeal came  before  the  judge  on  12
    August  2019.   He  was  represented  by  experienced   counsel.    The
    respondent was unrepresented.  There was a volume of rather  disordered
    paperwork submitted by the appellant's  (former)  representatives.   In
    addition to the main bundle  of  181  pages,  there  was  an  unindexed
    supplementary bundle of 89 pages,  a  second  supplementary  bundle  of
    eight pages, a further supplementary bundle of 16 pages, and some loose
    documents from his accountants.  Counsel provided the judge with copies
    of the decisions (not the reports) in R (Khan)  v  SSHD  (JR/3097/2017)
    and Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673.  On any view, this was a  difficult
    case, with a mass of material which was presented in the most unhelpful
    fashion.

 5. The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant, although he  was  not
    cross-examined due to the absence of a Presenting  Officer.   He  heard
    submissions from counsel, who took him through the  detailed  financial
    material presented by the appellant and submitted,  in  basic  outline,
    that the appellant's  accountants  had  erred  in  completing  his  tax
    returns and that there had  been  no  deception  on  the  part  of  the
    appellant.

 6. The judge did not accept the appellant's account.  At [22],  he  stated
    that it was 'impossible to see how the Appellant's tax return [for  the
    tax year 2010-2011] can be seen as being even vaguely  consistent  with
    the Appellant's claimed self-employment'.  The discrepancy  upon  which
    he focused in  that  paragraph  was  between  the  self-employment  sum
    disclosed to the respondent in that period (just under  �31k)  and  the
    self-employment profit disclosed to HMRC in that tax year  (just  under
    �17k).  The judge did not accept that this discrepancy was the fault of
    the appellant's advisers, and he relied on the fact that the  appellant
    was a business consultant who would have known the  difference  between
    turnover and net income: [23].  He also noted that  there  had  been  a
    'considerable leap' in the appellant's earnings from the  previous  tax
    year.  The judge considered there to be no adequate explanation of  why
    the appellant would claim self-employment income in his  dealings  with
    the respondent which substantially exceeded  his  turnover  from  self-
    employment for the same year: [24].  The judge  did  not  consider  the
    evidence from Tax Direct Ltd to explain this difficulty: [25]-[26].

 7. At [28], the judge concluded that the ground of refusal under paragraph
    322(5) was 'entirely justified', not least because  the  appellant  had
    been unable to explain himself in interview and due to the lack of  any
    evidence from an accountant to support the appellant's account.

 8. The judge then reached similar conclusions in relation  to  the  second
    tax year in contemplation (2012/2013), at [29]-[36].  At [34], he noted
    that correspondence from the appellant's accountants did not adequately
    explain the difference between the self-employment  income  claimed  in
    the Tier 1 application (just over �36k) and the self-employment  profit
    figure provided to HMRC for the same year (just over �11k).  At the end
    of this section of his decision, the judge stated that he was satisfied
    that the respondent's decision was 'entirely  in  accordance  with  the
    evidence and the law': [36].

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 9. The appellant instructed different representatives for  his  appeal  to
    the Upper Tribunal.  Grounds of appeal were settled by Mr  Hodgetts  of
    counsel on 11 November 2019.  There are no fewer than  six  grounds  of
    appeal, which may be summarised as follows:

      i) The judge misdirected himself in law regarding the burden of proof.

     ii) The judge failed to consider whether the respondent had  discharged
         the legal burden upon her.

    iii) The judge failed to consider whether the appellant had the mens rea
         of  dishonesty,  or  had  provided  insufficient  reasons  for   so
         concluding.

     iv) The judge failed to take evidence into account  which  corroborated
         the appellant's version of events in respect of the  2010/2011  tax
         year.

      v) The judge similarly erred in respect of the 2012/2013 tax year.

     vi) The judge failed to consider the discretionary element of paragraph
         322(5).

10. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Chohan on  all  grounds.   He
    noted that it was correct to state that the judge had placed the burden
    of proof on the appellant, as contended  in  ground  one.   He  queried
    whether any such error was material to the outcome, however, and stated
    that this question needed  to  be  explored  further.   Judge  Chohan's
    decision was sent to the parties by email on 26 May 2020.

11. On 10 July 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam  issued  directions  to
    the parties.  She had reached the  provisional  view  that  the  appeal
    might properly be considered on the papers.  She sought the submissions
    of the parties on that course of  action  and  on  the  merits  of  the
    appeal.

12. On 22 July 2020, submissions in amplification of the grounds of  appeal
    were filed and served by the appellant's solicitors.  On 29 July  2020,
    a response was provided by Mr  Avery  of  the  respondent's  Specialist
    Appeals Team.  The response is materially as follows:

         On  consideration  of  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the   further
         submission made on behalf of the appellant the  respondent  accepts
         that the judge at the first tier erred in law.   She  accepts  that
         the FTT failed to consider if the Secretary of State had discharged
         the evidential burden.

         In the circumstances  the  respondent  considers  that  a  de  novo
         hearing in the First Tier would be appropriate.

13. Understandably, the appellant's solicitors  filed  no  reply  to  these
    submissions.

Discussion

14. This is plainly a case in which it is  in  accordance  with  the  over-
    riding objective to determine the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  without
    a hearing.  As I have recorded above, the parties are in agreement that
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and that it  should  accordingly  be  set  aside.   I
    require no oral submissions to determine the appeal fairly  and  justly
    to both sides and it is in the interests of the  parties  to  determine
    the appeal without further delay.

15. Like the respondent, I consider it to  be  absolutely  clear  that  the
    judge erred in law as contended in ground one.  The judge was  provided
    with copies of relevant authorities.  Whether  he  considered  Khan  or
    Balajigari (neither of which he mentioned in his  decision),  it  would
    have been clear to him that the legal burden  of  proof  was  upon  the
    respondent in relation to the allegation under paragraph  322(5).   The
    direction he gave himself at [5]  ("The  burden  of  proof  is  on  the
    appellant to establish all material facts/issues and  the  standard  of
    proof is the civil standard, that of a balance of probabilities.")  was
    clearly wrong in a case of this nature.

16. The only issue in this case was the allegation  under  322(5)  and  the
    respondent bore the burden of proving  that  allegation  to  the  civil
    standard.  As is  clear  from  the  authorities,  however,  the  proper
    approach  is  further  refined,  in  that  it  requires  a  three-stage
    assessment.  The judge should have  considered,  firstly,  whether  the
    respondent had discharged  the  evidential  burden  of  establishing  a
    reasonable suspicion of dishonesty on the part of  the  appellant.   It
    was then for the appellant to adduce a reasonable explanation  for  the
    matters of concern.  Finally, it was for the judge to consider  whether
    the respondent had discharged the legal burden, taking into account all
    of the evidence before him.  His reasoning was not only premised  on  a
    misunderstanding of the burden, therefore; it represented an elision of
    these three stages.

17. Judge Chohan sagely observed that it might be said  by  the  respondent
    that any such error was not  material  and  that  that  issue  required
    further consideration.   I  note  that  despite  that  invitation,  the
    respondent has not sought to  make  any  such  submission.   Given  the
    respondent's stance, I do not propose to proceed down that route of  my
    own volition.  I am content to  accept  the  submission  made  by  both
    parties, that the error was a  clear  and  serious  one  and  that  the
    decision should be set aside on that basis alone.

18. In the circumstances, I propose to say very little about the  remaining
    grounds of appeal. The second and third  grounds  add  nothing  to  the
    first, with respect to their author.

19. The fourth and fifth grounds do,  in  my  judgment,  establish  further
    error on the part of the judge.  There was  material  which  tended  to
    offer some  support  for  the  appellant's  account  which  was  indeed
    overlooked by the judge.  In respect of the first  period  (2010/2011),
    the judge overlooked the material listed at  [2.4.2]  of  Mr  Hodgetts'
    grounds, comprising invoices from sub-contractors who were said to have
    undertaken work for him during  this  tax  year.   In  respect  of  the
    application made in 2013, the judge failed to engage lawfully with  the
    accountant's evidence that they had erroneously failed to  account  for
    sub-contracting work as expenses, as contended in ground five.

20.  Ground  six  criticises  the  judge  for  failing  to   consider   the
    discretionary element of paragraph 322(5)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The merit in this ground was underlined, three months after the grounds
    of appeal were settled, in Yaseen [2020] EWCA Civ  157;  [2020]  1  WLR
    1359.  At [46] of his judgment in that case, Rupert  Jackson  LJ  (with
    whom Simler LJ and Sir Jack Beatson agreed), emphasised the  importance
    "in all but the most extreme cases" of conducting a balancing  exercise
    under paragraph 322(5), considering  the  matters  militating  for  and
    against the exercise  of  discretion.   The  judge  undertook  no  such
    balancing exercise in this case, seemingly concluding that his  primary
    findings of fact justified refusal under paragraph 322(5) without more.



Postcript

21. I add this.  The appeal will be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for
    consideration afresh.  The management of the appeal will  obviously  be
    for that Tribunal. For my part, however, I would firmly expect that the
    evidence upon which the appellant seeks to  rely  should  be  within  a
    single, consolidated bundle which is fully paginated  and  indexed.   I
    have been critical of the judge of the First-tier Tribunal but I do not
    doubt that his task was rendered exponentially more difficult  than  it
    should have been by  the  appalling  way  in  which  the  evidence  was
    presented, and by the absence of a skeleton  argument.   The  financial
    information in this case was reasonably complicated  and  the  law  has
    developed at pace over the  last  two  years  or  so.   The  judge  was
    entitled to assistance in both respects but I doubt  that  he  received
    it.  The next judge will legitimately expect it.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT involved the making of  errors  on  points  of  law.
That decision is set aside and the appeal is remitted  to  the  FtT,  to  be
heard de novo by a judge other than Judge Khawar.

No anonymity direction is made.
