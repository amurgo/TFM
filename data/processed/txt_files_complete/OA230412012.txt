                                   Between

                            Mrs shakeela Mahmood
                       (anonymity direction not made)

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms J Russell, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Ms C Johnston, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State is, technically, the  appellant  in  this  Upper
    Tribunal appeal but for the sake of consistency the Secretary of  State
    is referred to in  this  determination  as  "the  respondent"  and  the
    original appellant, Mrs Mahmood, continues to be referred  to  as  "the
    appellant".

2.   The appellant is a 23 year old citizen of  Pakistan  whose  application
    for entry clearance to enter the UK as the wife of her British born and
    settled husband Mr Qasim Mahmood was refused  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer on 17 October 2012.  Her application was  refused  because  her
    sponsor was unable to meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM of
    the Immigration Rules in that his income fell far short of the  minimum
    earnings requirement of ï¿½18,600 per  annum.   In  addition,  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer was not satisfied as to the proposed accommodation.

3.   The appellant appealed against that  decision.   In  her  determination
    promulgated on 20 December 2013 First-tier Tribunal Judge Mensah  noted
    that the appellant  accepted  that  she  did  not  meet  the  financial
    threshold of the Rules  and  therefore  could  not  succeed  under  the
    Immigration Rules  as  such.   The  judge,  however,  referred  to  the
    decision of Blake J in the case of MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin)  who
    criticised the financial requirements of the Rules and, relying on  MM,
    the judge allowed the appeal under Article 8.

4.   The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal,  arguing  that  MM
    was no more than persuasive authority but, particularly,  arguing  that
    in light of the decision in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC) the refusal
    of entry clearance could not be considered to  be  unjustifiably  harsh
    nor  were  there  any  exceptional  circumstances;  the  appeal  should
    therefore not have been  allowed  under  Article  8.   Based  on  those
    submissions permission to appeal was granted on 26 March 2014.

5.   On the issue of material error of law I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives.  The Presenting Officer relied on  the  grounds.   The
    relevant date is the Entry Clearance Officer's decision of  17  October
    2012 and it was accepted that the appellant cannot meet the maintenance
    requirements.  Nor was there any finding whatever by the judge  on  the
    question of accommodation.  It was submitted that the correct  approach
    by the appellant is to  make  a  new  application  when  she  (and  the
    sponsor) can meet the required minimum maintenance level.

6.   Ms Russell, in reply, acknowledged that the judge's  determination  was
    exceptionally short and that the High Court decision  in  Nagre  [2013]
    EWHC 720  (Admin)  now  requires  the  appellant  to  show  exceptional
    circumstances namely ones where refusal would lead to an  unjustifiably
    harsh outcome.  In this case, she  submitted,  the  refusal  means  the
    separation of the family.  There are two young children now aged nearly
    4 and nearly 3 who remain with their mother in Pakistan.  They are both
    British citizens and are entitled to come to the  UK  but  the  sponsor
    does not wish to bring them here without their mother.

7.   Following  completion  of  the  submissions  I  indicated  that  I  was
    satisfied that there was a material error of law in  the  determination
    such that the decision in relation to Article 8 could not  stand.   The
    error of law is the fact that the judge gave no  adequate  reasons  for
    her findings.  The determination is extraordinarily  short  and,  apart
    from referring very briefly to the  case  of  MM,  the  judge  gave  no
    reasons why this case was exceptional and  why  the  Immigration  Rules
    should not be followed.

8.   It was then agreed by both representatives  that  no  further  evidence
    was required and that I should proceed to remake the Article 8 decision
    based on the evidence that was already before the Tribunal.  I  now  do
    so.

9.   It is common ground that the appellant and her sponsor do not meet  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules.  Nor has any  adequate
    evidence been provided as  to  the  proposed  accommodation.   In  that
    respect all that has been provided is a single page  tenancy  agreement
    in the names of the sponsor and, according to the  appellant's  bundle,
    that of his late grandmother.  There is also a letter from the landlord
    agreeing that the appellant and her children may live there  with  him.
    Although the landlord's letter states that the house is a three bedroom
    house there is no evidence of the size of the accommodation or  whether
    anyone else lives at the property with him.

10.  Be that as it may the only issue before me now is that  of  Article  8.
    I note that the appellant and her sponsor was married in Pakistan on 22
    December 2006 and that they now have two young children who  were  born
    in and remain in Pakistan.  The marriage was arranged by the  sponsor's
    family and he first went to Pakistan to meet  her  in  April  2005;  he
    stayed there until the marriage.  Subsequently the sponsor went back to
    Pakistan to be with his wife on 29 September 2008  and  remained  there
    with her for nearly three years until 26 July 2011.  It was during that
    time that their two children were born.  I take all those factors  into
    account in reaching my decision.

11.  I must, however,  take  notice  of  and  follow  the  Court  of  Appeal
    decision in Haleemudeen [2014] EWCA Civ 558.  At paragraphs 42  and  43
    of that decision Beatson LJ said this:
         "42. The authorities make it clear that the focus of any assessment
             of whether an interference with private life pursuant  to  the
             requirements of immigration control is proportionate should be
             whether the Secretary of State's  decision  is  in  accordance
             with those provisions.  See in particular the decisions of the
             Immigration and Asylum Chamber of the Upper Tribunal, presided
             over by its then President, Blake J, in Secretary of State for
             the Home Department v Izuazu [2013] UKUT 45 at [40] and  [42]-
             [43], of Sales J in  Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) at [26] and
             [29]-[31], and of this court in MF (Nigeria) [2013]  EWCA  Civ
             1192.
           43.    In Nagre's case Sales J stated (at [26] and [29]) that  it
             is necessary to find 'particular factors in  individual  cases
             ... of especially compelling force in favour  of  a  grant  of
             leave to remain' even  though  those  factors  are  not  fully
             reflected in and dealt with in the new Rules and 'to  consider
             whether there are compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently
             recognised under the new Rules to require the  grant  of  such
             leave'. In MF (Nigeria), albeit in the context of  deportation
             and Article 8, this court stated (at [44]) that the Rules  are
             'a complete code', and that the provision in paragraph  398(c)
             that  where  the  exceptions  to  mandatory   deportation   in
             paragraphs 399 and 399A do not apply,  'it  will  only  be  in
             exceptional  circumstances  that  the   public   interest   in
             deportation will be outweighed by other factors' involves  the
             application of a  proportionality  test  as  required  by  the
             Strasbourg jurisprudence."
12.   In  this  case  I  am  satisfied  that  there   are   no   exceptional
    circumstances which require me to consider the Strasbourg jurisprudence
    outside the Immigration Rules.  As I have already said,  it  is  common
    ground that the appellant and her sponsor do not meet  the  Immigration
    Rules; they did not do so at the date of the decision and I was told at
    the  hearing  before  me  that  they  still  could   not   meet   those
    requirements.  I am mindful of the decision in Mahmood that  a  married
    couple, for Article 8 purposes, does not have the right  to  choose  in
    which country they should live.  There is no  absolute  right  for  the
    appellant to come to the UK simply because she is married to a  British
    citizen.  Indeed, it is apparent, that since the date of  the  marriage
    the sponsor has spent several years living with his wife  and  children
    in Pakistan and he is undoubtedly free, if he wishes to do so, to  live
    there again with his wife and children.  Against all that,  I  have  to
    weigh in the balance the undoubted rights of the Secretary of State  in
    relation to immigration control and, although I do not need to apply  a
    proportionality test under the Strasbourg  jurisprudence  for  all  the
    reasons I have mentioned above, the Secretary of State's rights in this
    matter are likely to outweigh in the balance the personal wishes of the
    appellant and her sponsor.

13.  For all these reasons the appellant cannot succeed under Article 8  and
    her claim must be dismissed.

Decision

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained a material  error  of
law in relation to its findings  under  Article  8  and  that  part  of  the
determination  is  accordingly  set  aside.   I  remake  the   decision   by
dismissing the appellant's claims under Article 8.

No anonymity direction has been requested and none is made.
