                                                                  Respondent

 Representation:

 For the Appellant:  Mr P Lingajorthy, legal representative, Linga & Co
 Solicitors
 For the Respondent: Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. This is an appeal against the decision, promulgated on 15 April 2015,
       of First-tier Tribunal Judge SD Lloyd (hereinafter referred to as the
       FTTJ).









                          ï¿½ CROWN COPYRIGHT 2015
    Background

    2. The appellants, who are husband and wife,  both  entered  the  United
       Kingdom as Tier 4 migrants during 2010  and  married  in  the  United
       Kingdom on 23 November 2012. On 31 March 2014 they  sought  residence
       cards as confirmation of a right to reside in the United  Kingdom  as
       the extended family members of Mrs Kunaniji Athithan, who is a French
       national  to  whom  the  appellants  are  unrelated.   Mrs   Athithan
       (hereinafter referred to as the sponsor)  is  married  to  the  first
       appellant's cousin Mr Athithan Kanesu. In refusing  the  applications
       on 9 May 2014, the Secretary of State commented  that  there  was  no
       evidence that the appellants were dependent  upon  or  residing  with
       their sponsor prior to entering the United Kingdom  and  insufficient
       evidence that since entering the United Kingdom they  have  continued
       to be dependent upon or residing with the sponsor.


    3. In the grounds of appeal, the  appellants  asserted  that  they  were
       related as claimed to the sponsor; that they were previously residing
       with and dependent upon the sponsor and that  they  continued  to  be
       dependent on the sponsor and reside with her in the  United  Kingdom.
       Reference was also made to the first appellant's private life,  which
       he had established in the United Kingdom.


    4. At the hearing before the FTTJ, an  attempt  was  made  to  serve  an
       appellant's bundle, which contained the  witness  statements  of  six
       witnesses. The FTTJ excluded that item but, after discussion with the
       parties, agreed to hear evidence from four of the six witnesses.  The
       FTTJ  heard  from  both  appellants,  the  sponsor  and   the   first
       appellant's cousin. The FTTJ noted that there was no challenge to the
       relationship between the parties. It was not accepted that the  first
       appellant was previously dependent upon his cousin or the sponsor  or
       that he was previously part of his cousin's  household.  Nor  was  it
       accepted that the appellants were dependent on the sponsor. The  FTTJ
       referred to evidence indicating that the appellants had  been  living
       with the sponsor  from  approximately  4  months  prior  to  the  EEA
       application having been made and accepted that they  formed  part  of
       the sponsor's household. The appellants' Article  8  claim  was  also
       dismissed, outside the Rules.

    5. The grounds of application argue, in the main, that the FTTJ  made  a
       procedural error in excluding part of the appellants'  evidence  from
       his consideration. Criticism  was  also  made  regarding  the  FTTJ's
       conclusion that the appellants were not extended family  members  and
       the decision on Article 8.

    6. FTTJ Levin granted permission solely  on  the  basis  that  the  FTTJ
       arguably erred in refusing the application to admit late evidence  or
       adjourning the hearing.


    6. The Secretary of State lodged a Rule 24 response on 6 July  2015.  In
       opposing the appeal,  the  respondent  noted  that  the  evidence  in
       question was available for  5  months  prior  to  the  hearing  date;
       referred to [7] of the decision where reference was made to the  FTTJ
       hearing evidence from both appellants and their sponsors in order  to
       ensure fairness and it was noted that the FTTJ  considered  both  the
       position of dependency and household but did not accept the evidence.
       It was said that the FTTJ directed himself appropriately.












    Error of law


    7. At the hearing before me, Mr Lingajorthy told  me  that  he  was  the
       representative at the hearing before the FTTJ. He proceeded  to  give
       evidence regarding  that  hearing,  despite  not  having  produced  a
       witness statement, which set out his account of matters. I noted that
       there was no attempt by Mr Lingajorthy to engage with the decision in
       BW(Witness statements by advocates) Afghanistan  [2014]  00568  (IAC)
       however I considered that the decision of the FTTJ spoke  for  itself
       regarding the alleged procedural impropriety and therefore decided to
       proceed with the hearing.


    8. Mr Lingajorthy confirmed that he was relying only on the basis of the
       grant of permission, in that that there was evidential unfairness  in
       the FTTJ refusing to accept the additional evidence. He  argued  that
       the appellants had been severely handicapped  because  the  FTTJ  had
       found that there  was  nothing  to  show  that  the  appellants  were
       dependent  upon  the  sponsor.  Mr  Lingajorthy  told  me  that   the
       additional 2 witnesses, namely Mr Sivakumar  and  Mr  Kunaseelan  had
       attended the hearing and indeed were present at  the  hearing  before
       me. He argued that the decision could  not  be  cured  and  that  the
       matter would have to be re-litigated. I  invited  submissions  as  to
       whether any potential error of  law  was  material  in  view  of  the
       judgment in Soares [2013] EWCA Civ 575 at [4(ii)];


       "Regulation 8(2)(a) and  (c)  do  not  extend  to  dependence  on  or
       household membership of a spouse or partner of the EEA national."

    9. Mr Lingajorthy, who expressed his unfamiliarity with the Soares,  had
       nothing to say regarding that judgment.


   10. Mr Duffy submitted that there was no  evidence  that  the  additional
       bundle was submitted in advance of the hearing; it  was  not  on  the
       case file and the Secretary of State had not  had  sight  of  it.  He
       argued that it was open to the  FTTJ  to  exclude  it  and  that  any
       prejudice to the appellants was limited as they  could  make  another
       application.

   11. In response, Mr Lingajorthy agreed that the appellants could  make  a
       further application but argued that they had not been given a  proper
       opportunity to state their case.

   12. The appellants' appeal before the FTTJ was  initially  listed  for  a
       hearing on 13 October 2014, as shown by the notice of hearing  posted
       to the parties on 12 June 2014. Included  on  the  said  notice  were
       directions in which the parties were directed to send a bundle of all
       documents upon which they wished to rely within three  weeks  of  the
       date of that notice. On 1 July 2014 Linga & Co Solicitors sent a 110-
       page bundle of documents, which  consisted  of  documentary  evidence
       relating to the appellants and sponsors, but no statements  from  any
       witnesses.

   13. Linga & Co Solicitors prepared witness statements  for  Mr  Sivakumar
       and Mr Kunaseelan, as well as the other four  witnesses,  which  were
       signed on 8 October 2014. It was common ground  that  they  were  not
       sent to the tribunal or the respondent in line with directions.

   14. The hearing of the appeal at the First-tier did  not  proceed  on  13
       October 2014. On 10  October  2014,  notification  was  sent  to  the
       parties advising them that a new hearing date would  be  forthcoming.
       On 13 October 2014, the parties were sent a notice of hearing  giving
       a new date for the appeal of 2  March  2015.   On  that  notice,  the
       parties were directed to provide "witness statements of the  evidence
       to be called at the hearing" as well as all other documents relied on
       no later than 5 days before the date of hearing.


   15. As indicated above, Mr Lingajorthy handed the FTTJ a 48-page  bundle,
       which  included  the  witness  statements  of  Mr  Sivakumar  and  Mr
       Kunaseelan. Also included were signed witness  statements  from  both
       appellants and the two sponsors also dated 8 October 2014

   16. The same bundle had been sent by facsimile to the Tribunal at 8pm  on
       the last working day before the 2 March 2015 and did  not  reach  the
       file in time. The Secretary of State  was  never  served  with  these
       documents and accordingly did not have the opportunity to  carry  out
       checks against Mr Sivakumar and Mr Kunaseelan or  to  prepare  cross-
       examination in relation to any of the six witnesses.

   17. After some discussions, at [7] the FTTJ agreed to hear from  four  of
       the witnesses, that is the appellants and sponsors.

   18. The FTTJ had regard to the overriding objective in the 2014 Procedure
       Rules, referring in particular to his case management powers and also
       his duty to deal with the case fairly and justly. I consider it would
       have been unfair to  the  respondent  for  the  FTTJ  to  admit  this
       evidence at such a late stage. At  the  same  time  the  FTTJ  showed
       awareness of the importance of avoiding delay at [6] where  he  noted
       the earlier vacated hearing and the delay in Linga  &  Co  submitting
       evidence, which had been in their possession for 5 months. These were
       decisions the FTTJ was entitled to make.

   19. I find that had the FTTJ considered the statements and oral  evidence
       of Mr Sivakumar and Mr Kunaseelan, it would have made  no  difference
       to the outcome of the appeal. The evidence  of  these  gentlemen  was
       that they carried cash to India on behalf of  the  sponsors  for  the
       first appellant's benefit. The reason why the  FTTJ  did  not  accept
       that the appellants had been dependent previously on the sponsors, is
       found at [29], as follows;

     "Despite what is claimed to be a significant and regular remittance  of
       funds to the First Appellant, both to his father and to pay  for  his
       degree education in India, there is no documentary evidence  of  this
       whatsoever. Whilst I take account of the Appellant's contention  that
       at the time they did not know receipts would need to be  produced,  I
       find it highly unlikely that there would be no  evidence  at  all  of
       this substantial financial commitment. Particularly as it would  seem
       that since 2007 the Sponsor was involved in those payments and it  is
       stated that, at least now, that was  being  funded  from  a  business
       account."


   20. There was no reasoned challenge to those findings in the  appellants'
       application for permission to appeal or the submissions made on their
       behalf. Therefore  even  had  the  FTTJ  heard  the  evidence  of  Mr
       Sivakumar and Mr Kunaseelan, the position with regard to the complete
       absence of documentary evidence of the remittance of funds  would  be
       unchanged.


   21. There is also the matter of the judgment in Soares to which the  FTTJ
       was not referred but which concludes that Regulation 8 does not apply
       to those claiming to be dependent upon the spouse of an EEA national,
       as in this case.


   22. There is no material error of law in the FTTJ's decision.

   23. There is no justification for making an anonymity direction  in  this
       matter.







 Conclusions

    1) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve
       the making of an error on a point of law.

    2) I uphold the decision of the FTTJ.
