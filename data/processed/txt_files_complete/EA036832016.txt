For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the  appeal  of  Mr  Hird  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision, refusing him a residence card as an extended family member of
    an EEA national.  The refusal is dated 9 March 2016.
2.   The judge in the light of the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Sala
    concluded that the appeal fell to be dismissed on jurisdiction  issues,
    but really as he noted more accurately at paragraph 20, it is that  the
    Tribunal on the basis of the law at that time did not have jurisdiction
    to hear the appeal and therefore  that  as  far  as  the  Tribunal  was
    concerned there was an end of the matter, but permission to appeal  was
    granted subsequently by a Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Events
    have moved on of course since then, it has been decided by the Court of
    Appeal that Sala was wrongly decided.  There is  jurisdiction  in  this
    case, there is a right of appeal in the  case  of  an  extended  family
    member of an EEA national and accordingly the judge's decision  is  set
    aside and the matter is remitted for a full rehearing in the First-tier
    Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
