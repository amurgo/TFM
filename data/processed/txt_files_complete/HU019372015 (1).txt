Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nepal who applied for entry clearance to
    join his parents in the UK, his father having settled in the UK being a
    former  Gurkha  soldier.  The  application  having  been  refused   the
    Appellant appealed. The appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Phillips at Taylor House on the 8th of February 2017 and dismissed in a
    decision promulgated on the 24th of February 2017.

 2. In the decision it was noted that it was accepted that annexe K did not
    apply as the Sponsor had not been granted  settlement  under  the  2009
    discretionary  arrangements.  The  Judge's  findings  are  set  out  at
    paragraphs 20 to 43 of the decision. In doing so the  Judge  considered
    the provisions of paragraph 19 of  Annexe  K  and  the  time  that  the
    Appellant had spent living  in  Nepal  and  the  requirement  that  the
    Appellant and Sponsor had not lived apart for more than  2  years.  The
    Judge found that it had not been shown that Annexe applied, a  previous
    appeal under the Immigration Rules had been dismissed,  the  Judge  was
    not satisfied that the  family  unit  had  been  maintained  since  the
    Sponsor and his wife had left Nepal  in  August/September  2006.  Since
    refusal the Appellant's parents  had  maintained  their  residence  and
    family unit in the UK.

 3. In paragraph 29 the Judge referred to the case of AA and found that the
    Appellant could not be said to be residing in a family with the Sponsor
    as part of a family unit because his parents settled in the UK in 2006.
    The Judge went on to  find  that  the  personal  circumstances  of  the
    Sponsor did not justify a grant of leave.  The  Judge  found  that  the
    exclusion of the Appellant would not place the  UK  in  breach  of  the
    obligations under article 8.

 4. The grounds argue that the Judge did not  consider  the  issue  of  the
    Appellant's family life adequately in the light of the evidence of  the
    time that the Sponsor and the Appellant's mother  had  spent  in  Nepal
    following their grant of ILR. It was submitted that  article  8(1)  was
    engaged and that the appeal should have been allowed having  regard  to
    the historic injustice.

 5. In submissions it was observed that  the  evidence  showed  that  since
    being granted ILR the  Appellant's  mother  spent  5ï¿½  years  in  Nepal
    compared to 3 years in the UK. There was evidence of financial  support
    and communication. There was no adverse immigration  history.  for  the
    Home Office it  was  submitted  that  the  reasons  and  findings  were
    adequate and the Judge was entitled to find that there  was  no  family
    life. At the date of the application the  Appellant  was  over  27  and
    there was no evidence to show he could not care  for  himself.  Matters
    relevant to the historic injustice had been  considered.  The  decision
    was reserved.

 6. Given the amount of time that the Appellant's mother has spent in Nepal
    it could be questioned whether she is  settled  in  the  UK  for  these
    purposes, there is no evidence to show that she would  stop  travelling
    back and forth as she has done up to now.

 7. What does concern me about the decision is that there is no analysis of
    the time that the Sponsor and his wife have spent in Nepal in the years
    since ILR was granted. As indicated above it could be argued  that  the
    Sponsor and/or his wife have not settled in  the  UK  but  equally  the
    times spent there and in the UK have not been analysed to  see  if  the
    Appellant remained part of the family unit as such and if so  for  what
    periods. If he did is there any relevance to Annexe K by analogy?

 8. In the circumstances, and with some hesitation, I find that  the  Judge
    erred in the analysis undertaken by the Judge with  regard  to  whether
    there is family life within the meaning of article 8(1) of the ECHR. In
    the circumstances it seems to me preferable that the appeal  should  be
    remitted for all relevant evidence to be collated and assessed with  no
    findings preserved.

CONCLUSIONS

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

The decision is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor  House  to  be
heard de novo, not to be heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge C M Phillips.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  make  no
order.

Fee Award

I make no fee award which remains a matter for the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
the conclusion of the decision of the remitted appeal.
