For the Appellants:          Mr R. O'Ryan of Counsel instructed by
Greenhall Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C. Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellants are all nationals of Pakistan.   They are respectively a
    father, mother and their three minor children, born in 2004,  2007  and
    2011. They all seek leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  on  human
    rights grounds.




    Anonymity Order


 2. There is no reason why the identity of the adult Appellants  should  be
    protected. The case does however turn on the  presence  in  the  United
    Kingdom of the minor Appellants. I have had regard to Rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008  and  the  Presidential
    Guidance Note No 1 of 2013:  Anonymity  Orders.  I  am  concerned  that
    identification of the adult Appellants could lead to identification  of
    children involved and I therefore consider it appropriate  to  make  an
    order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




       Background and Matters in Issue


 3. The chronology of this matter, insofar as is relevant to  my  decision,
    is as follows:


    4.10.08      Father of family enters the United Kingdom with  leave  to
                  enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant


    28.01.09     Mother enters the United Kingdom with two eldest  children
                  A and F. All given leave as dependents of father


    2.1.11 Youngest child Z born


    5.12.14      Family made in-time application for  leave  to  remain  on
                  human rights grounds


    20.2.15      Respondent refuses to vary leave so as to grant  leave  on
                  human rights grounds


 4. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Lebasci)  it
    was accepted that none of the Appellants could meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules. Since neither parent was settled they could  not
    rely upon each other as 'partners' under  Appendix  FM;  nor  did  they
    pursue a case on the grounds that they met the requirements  under  the
    relevant 'private life' provision, paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi). Counsel for
    the family further agreed  that  the  children  could  not  succeed  on
    'private life' grounds since at the date of  the  application  none  of
    them had been living in this country  for  a  continuous  period  of  7
    years: paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) refers.  The case was therefore  pursued
    on Article 8 grounds 'outside of the rules'.


 5.  The  First-tier  Tribunal,  it  is  agreed,  directed  itself  to  the
    appropriate legal framework. It first considered,  and  rejected,  each
    case under the Rules. It then considered the position 'outside  of  the
    rules', having set out, earlier  in  the  determination,  the  relevant
    'public  interest'  factors  listed  in  s117B  of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.  The  Tribunal  made  two  important
    findings in the Appellants' favour. At  �37  it  found  that  the  best
    interests of the children would be primarily served by maintaining  the
    family unit, and that the best interests of the children, in respect of
    their education and long-term prospects, would be served by  permitting
    them to remain in the United Kingdom. The Tribunal  nevertheless  found
    the refusal to grant leave proportionate for the following reasons  [at
    �40-41]:

        . The maintenance of immigration control is in the public interest


        . The family are not financially independent

        . The private life of the Appellants has  been  established  whilst
          their status was precarious and so attracts only a little weight

        . The best interests of the children can  be  overridden  by  other
          factors

        . The children would be able to go to school in Pakistan,  continue
          their passions (such as karate); their parents would be  able  to
          support them by working and there are other family members  there
          who would be able to offer assistance

        . All of the Appellants speak the language (Urdu)

 6. The appeals were thereby dismissed.


 7. Permission was sought, and granted (by Upper Tribunal Judge  Grubb)  on
    the grounds that the First-tier Tribunal has erred in failing to direct
    itself to the terms of s117B(6) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002. The test in respect of the  children  was  not  simply
    'proportionality  outside  of  the  rules':  it  was  whether  it   was
    reasonable to expect these children to leave the United Kingdom.  It is
    submitted  that  this  term  had  to  be  interpreted  and  applied  in
    accordance with the Respondent's own policy  and  the  guidance  in  MA
    (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705: there had to be 'powerful  reasons'  to
    refuse these children leave, and since the Tribunal had failed to  find
    any, the appeal should be allowed.



    Discussion and Findings

 8. It is not in dispute that at the date of the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    two elder children in this family had lived in the United Kingdom for a
    continuous period of over 7 years.  They  were  therefore  'qualifying'
    children under Part V of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 (as amended by the Immigration Act 2014): see section 117D.


 9. The parties are in agreement that the legal  framework  the  First-tier
    Tribunal should have applied was a  Razgar  Article  8  proportionality
    enquiry, informed by the public interest factors set out  in  s117B  of
    the 2002 Act, and the Respondent's published  policy  relevant  to  the
    interpretation of s117B(6).

10. The Tribunal was satisfied that each member of  the  family  enjoyed  a
    private life in the UK to the extent that the relatively low  threshold
    for engaging Article 8 was met. It appeared to  be  accepted  that  the
    decision  to  refuse  the  family  leave  could  interfere  with  their
    enjoyment of that right, given that the expected consequence of such  a
    decision would be the family's eventual removal from the UK.

11. The Appellants in turn  accepted  that  the  third  and  fourth  Razgar
    questions were answered in the  affirmative,  since  the  Secretary  of
    State clearly had, as a matter  of  law,  the  authority  to  make  the
    decision and the decision itself was driven  by  the  rational  Article
    8(2) purpose of protection of the economy.


12. The only matter in issue was whether the decision to remove this family
    was, in all the circumstances, proportionate. The  starting  point  for
    conducting that balancing exercise is s117B of the  2002  Act.  I  have
    emphasised the final sub-paragraph, as particularly pertinent  to  this
    appeal:
         Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases:

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

           (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

           (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

           (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

           (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

           (a) a private life, or

           (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

            (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
           relationship with a qualifying child, and

           (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
           United Kingdom.



13. At the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing (and the  date  of  this
    appeal, although further guidance is expected shortly from the  Supreme
    Court) the authoritative guidance on how this final sub-section  is  to
    be applied is to be found in MA (Pakistan):
      1. The paragraphs in section 117B achieve  different  objectives.  The
         structure of subsections (4) and (5) differs from  subsections  (1)
         to (3).  The  latter  identify  factors  bearing  upon  the  public
         interest which a court or tribunal is under a duty to consider  but
         it is for the decision maker to decide upon the weight to  give  to
         these  factors  in  making  the  determination,  subject  only   to
         compliance with public law  principles.  Subsections  (4)  and  (5)
         implicitly accept that the matters  identified  therein  should  be
         taken into account, but there is a direction as to the weight -  or
         more accurately, the relative lack of it - which should be given to
         these considerations. Parliament has here sought to  identify  both
         relevance and weight.
      1. Subsection (6) falls into a different category again. It  does  not
         simply  identify  factors  which  bear  upon  the  public  interest
         question. It resolves that question in the  context  of  article  8
         applications which satisfy the conditions  in  paragraphs  (a)  and
         (b). It does so by  stipulating  that  once  those  conditions  are
         satisfied, the public interest will  not  require  the  applicant's
         removal. Since the interference with the right to private or family
         life under article 8(1) can only be  justified  where  there  is  a
         sufficiently strong countervailing public interest  falling  within
         article 8(2), if the public  interest  does  not  require  removal,
         there is no other basis on which removal  could  be  justified.  It
         follows, in my judgment, that there can be no  doubt  that  section
         117B(6) must be read as a self-contained  provision  in  the  sense
         that Parliament has stipulated that where the conditions  specified
         in the sub-section are satisfied,  the  public  interest  will  not
         justify removal. It is not legitimate  to  have  regard  to  public
         interest considerations unless that is permitted, either explicitly
         or implicitly, by the subsection itself.
      1. Ms Giovannetti QC, counsel  for  the  Secretary  of  State,  argued
         otherwise. She contended that there may be circumstances where even
         though the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) are  satisfied  and
         the applicant is not liable for deportation, the Secretary of State
         may nonetheless refuse leave to remain  on  wider  public  interest
         grounds. But as she had to accept, that  analysis  requires  adding
         words to subsection (6) to the effect that where the conditions are
         satisfied, the public interest will not normally  require  removal,
         because on her approach, sometimes it will. I see  no  warrant  for
         distorting the unambiguous language of the section in that way.
      1. In my judgment, therefore, the  only  questions  which  courts  and
         tribunals need  to  ask  when  applying  section  117B(6)  are  the
         following:
         (1) Is the applicant liable to deportation? If so, section 117B  is
         inapplicable and instead the relevant code will usually be found in
         section 117C.
         (2) Does the applicant  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with the child?
         (3) Is the child a qualifying child as defined in section 117D?
         (4) Is it unreasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom?
      1. If the answer to the first question is no, and to the  other  three
         questions is  yes,  the  conclusion  must  be  that  article  8  is
         infringed.
14. To that extent the Court agreed with Mr Justice McCloskey in Treebhowan
    [2015] UKUT 00674 about the structure of s117B.  Sub-section (6) was of
    a markedly different nature to the preceding five  matters.  A  finding
    that it would not be reasonable to expect a qualifying child  to  leave
    is,   in  effect,   determinative  of  the  proportionality   balancing
    exercise.


15. The question then arises:  when will it be  unreasonable  to  expect  a
    child to leave the  United  Kingdom?   Having  adopted  the  Treebhowan
    structural analysis of s117B the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MA  go  on  to
    disagree with McCloskey J about what  matters  were  relevant  to  that
    enquiry.  McCloskey J  had  suggested  that  the  question  was  to  be
    answered solely with reference to  the  child,  and  his  or  her  best
    interests. The Court, with some  reluctance,  rejected  that  analysis.
    Drawing an analogy with the approach taken in  deportation  appeals  to
    the test of "undue harshness", the Court of Appeal was  persuaded  that
    the Secretary of State was correct in her contention that the  test  in
    fact required the public interest to be weighed into the  balance  when
    considering 'reasonableness'.  This would  include  all  the  pertinent
    matters set out at s117B(1)-(5), as well  as  any  other  'suitability'
    issues that might arise.  The Court was however clear that  the  public
    interest in s117B cases was materially  different  from  that  weighing
    against persons subject to deportation, where s117C would  be  applied.
    For the  latter,  the  statute  created  a  presumption  in  favour  of
    deportation. For the former, the statute read  in  line  with  existing
    jurisprudence, did just the opposite. At paragraph  46  Elias  LJ  says
    this:

         "Even on the approach of the Secretary of State, the  fact  that  a
         child has been here for  seven  years  must  be  given  significant
         weight when carrying out the proportionality exercise. Indeed,  the
         Secretary of State published guidance in August 2015 in the form of
         Immigration Directorate Instructions entitled "Family  Life  (as  a
         partner or parent) and Private Life: 10 Year Routes" in which it is
         expressly stated that once the seven years'  residence  requirement
         is satisfied, there need to be "strong reasons" for refusing  leave
         (para. 11.2.4). These instructions were not in force when the cases
         now subject to appeal were determined, but in my view  they  merely
         confirm what is implicit in adopting a policy of this nature. After
         such a period of time the  child  will  have  put  down  roots  and
         developed social, cultural and educational links  in  the  UK  such
         that it is likely to be highly disruptive if the child is  required
         to leave the UK. That may be less so when  the  children  are  very
         young because the focus of their lives will be on  their  families,
         but  the  disruption  becomes  more  serious  as  they  get  older.
         Moreover, in these cases there must be a  very  strong  expectation
         that the child's best interests will be to remain in  the  UK  with
         his parents as part of a family unit,  and  that  must  rank  as  a
         primary consideration in the proportionality assessment".

16. The Court goes on at paragraph 49 to conclude:


         "the fact that the child has been in the UK for seven  years  would
         need to be given significant weight in the proportionality exercise
         for two  related  reasons:  first,  because  of  its  relevance  to
         determining the nature and strength of the child's best  interests;
         and second, because it establishes as a starting point  that  leave
         should  be  granted  unless  there  are  powerful  reasons  to  the
         contrary".

17. Before me Mr Bates very properly conceded that the Tribunal had  failed
    to  follow  this  framework.  The  decision  nowhere  identifies   what
    'powerful reasons' might exist in this case such that would justify  an
    interference with the established private lives of these  children.   I
    am satisfied that for this reason, the decision must be set aside.   Mr
    Bates invited me to remake the decision on the basis of  the  facts  as
    found by the First-tier Tribunal, and  with  reference  to  the  public
    interest factors in s117B.


18. I begin by reminding myself that the public interest requires that  the
    immigration rules are maintained in a fair and consistent  manner.    I
    note that whilst none of the Appellants before me currently  had  leave
    expressly conferred by the Rules,  they  do  have  leave  conferred  by
    section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971. They each arrived in the United
    Kingdom with leave to enter, extended that leave when  appropriate  and
    made the applications underpinning  these  appeals  before  that  final
    grant of leave expired.

19. All of the Respondents speak fluent  English,  but  as  the  First-tier
    Tribunal note that is a neutral factor.   The  Tribunal  recorded  that
    "clearly the Appellants are not financially independent and owe much of
    their survival and progress  in  the  United  Kingdom  to  reliance  on
    publicly funded services". It is not immediately clear to me  what  the
    Tribunal here refers to  (the  First  Appellant  was  at  all  times  a
    privately funded student whose efforts to enlist in the Royal Navy were
    stymied by delays at the Home Office; there is no  evidence  before  me
    that the family have ever claimed public funds) but for the purpose  of
    the appeal I am prepared to proceed on the facts as found by the First-
    tier Tribunal. I note, and give weight to, the fact that it is  in  the
    public interest that persons who seek to settle in the  United  Kingdom
    are financially independent. In each case only a little weight  can  be
    attached  to  the  Appellant's  private  life  because  it   has   been
    established when the individual's status here was precarious,  although
    I note that in respect of the children this is  somewhat  mitigated  by
    the terms of 276ADE(1)(iv) and their young age: see Miah (section  117B
    NIAA 2002 - children) [2016] UKUT 31.  It is accepted that  each  adult
    Appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  each
    child.    The question remains: would it be reasonable  to  expect  the
    (qualifying) children to leave the United Kingdom?


20. The First-tier Tribunal found that it would be in the  children's  best
    interests to remain in the United Kingdom.   It accepted that the elder
    was at an important stage in his education (he was then about to choose
    his GCSE  options)  and  that  both  have  established  private  lives,
    enjoying friendships and activities outside of the home.  This  accords
    with the Respondent's view, as expressed in the policy, to  the  effect
    that children who have lived here for seven years will have effectively
    'put down roots'.   Against these matters I must weigh in  the  balance
    any countervailing factors capable of rendering the refusal of leave to
    the children 'reasonable'. I remind myself that reasons for so  finding
    must be "strong" or "powerful".  Mr Bates realistically  conceded  that
    he was unable to identify any such reasons in this case.  Both  parents
    are law abiding and have at all time complied with the requirements  of
    immigration  control.   He  accepted  that  in  light  of  the   recent
    Presidential decision in MT and ET (child's best interests; ex  tempore
    pilot) Nigeria [2018] UKUT 00088 (IAC) it could not be  said  that  the
    parents in this case had acted in a way that would be incompatible with
    granting leave. In that appeal the panel (Mr  Justice  Lane  and  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Lindsley) considered the case of an  applicant  who  had
    overstayed, had made a false asylum claim,  had  received  a  community
    order for using a false document to work illegally and who had  pursued
    various legal means of remaining in the United Kingdom. The panel found
    that even considered cumulatively  those  matters  did  not  amount  to
    powerful reasons why it would be reasonable to expect  the  applicant's
    qualifying child to leave the UK [at �34].

    Article 8.
