For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Albania and her date of birth is  5  July
    1987.  She applied for entry clearance as a partner to join her  spouse
    in the UK under Appendix FM.  The application was refused by the  Entry
    Clearance Officer as the appellant could not  satisfy  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Rules and had failed to provide certain evidence as
    required.

2.   The appellant appealed against the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer and her  appeal  was  dismissed  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Kimnell in a decision that was promulgated on  17  March  2014
    following a hearing on 2 March 2014.  Permission to appeal was  granted
    by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Simpson on 28 April 2014.  Thus the
    matter came before me.

3.   At the hearing before me the appellant did not  attend.   There  was  a
    letter from Malik & Malik Solicitors representing the  appellant  which
    was faxed to the Upper Tribunal on 17 June 2014 indicating  that  their
    client wishes  to  withdraw  her  appeal  in  order  to  submit  a  new
    application for entry clearance.  There was no objection to the  matter
    being withdrawn by the Presenting Officer, Ms A Holmes.

4.   I was satisfied that the appellant had given notice  of  withdrawal  in
    accordance with Rule 17(1)(a) and I consented to the withdrawal of  the
    appellant's case pursuant to Rule 17 of the 2008 Procedure Rules.






Signed        Joanna McWilliam                        Date 25 June 2014
