Representation:
For the Appellant:     Miss Mair, Counsel, instructed by Greater Manchester
                    Immigration Unit
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Albania. She claimed to have entered  the
    United Kingdom on October 16, 2013 and claimed asylum  on  October  18,
    2013. The respondent refused her application  on  May  14,  2014  under
    paragraph 336 HC 395 and on May 16, 2014 a decision was taken to remove
    her as an illegal entrant from the United Kingdom by way of  directions
    under paragraphs 8-10 of schedule 3 to the Immigration Act 1971.

 2. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal under  Section  82(1)
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (hereinafter  called  the
    2002 Act), as amended. The matter came before Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Fox (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") on October 8, 2014 and  he
    refused her appeal in a determination promulgated on November 5, 2014.

 3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on November 18, 2014. Permission
    to appeal was  granted  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Deans  on
    December 4, 2014.

 4. The matter came before me on the date set out above. The appellant  was
    in attendance and represented by his counsel.

PRELIMINARY ISSUE

 5. I asked Mr McVeety for his views on  the  two  grounds  raised  in  the
    grounds of appeal. He accepted the FtTJ's credibility findings had been
    made without any apparent reference to the medical and expert  evidence
    that had been adduced on the appellant's behalf and  he  also  conceded
    that findings had been made on matters that had not  been  put  to  the
    appellant. He accepted there was an error in law.

 6. Miss Mair invited me  to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh  hearing,  as  full  findings  of  fact  would  be
    required. Mr McVeety did not disagree with this approach.

 7. I considered Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement.

 8. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

        "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and  Enforcement
        Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
        Tribunal finds that the making of the  decision  concerned  involved
        the making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set
        aside the decision and, if it does so, must either remit the case to
        the First-tier Tribunal under section  12(2)(b)(i)  or  proceed  (in
        accordance  with  relevant  Practice  Directions)  to  re-make   the
        decision under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


        The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to re-
        make the decision, instead of remitting the case to  the  First-tier
        Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


        a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party  before  the
           First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other  opportunity  for
           that party's case to be put to and considered by the  First-tier
           Tribunal; or


        b) the nature or extent of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
           necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be  re-made
           is such that, having regard to the overriding objective in  rule
           2, it is  appropriate  to  remit  the  case  to  the  First-tier
           Tribunal.


        Remaking rather than  remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
        normal approach to determining appeals where  an  error  of  law  is
        found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


 9. In light of the Practice Direction I agreed the case should be remitted
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a full hearing on the appellant's asylum
    claim. The issue would be whether the appellant's account was credible.
     Mr McVeety indicated, as had his predecessor, that if her account  was
    credible then her claim would succeed.

10. I directed that the appellant's representatives serve by June  2,  2015
    any additional evidence in a paginated index and  where  appropriate  a
    key passage index for any country evidence should be enclosed.

11. The parties should ensure compliance  with  any  directions  issued  in
    light  of  the  fact  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier   Tribunal)
    (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014 will apply to  this  appeal
    from hereon.

Decision

12. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. I have set aside the decision.

13. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    appeal  hearing  under  Section  12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
    Enforcement Act 2007.

14. Under Rule 14(1) The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as
    amended) the  appellant  can  be  granted  anonymity  throughout  these
    proceedings, unless and until a tribunal or court directs otherwise. In
    light of the fact this is a trafficking case I direct that an order  be
    made.




                                                        Date: March 26, 2015
