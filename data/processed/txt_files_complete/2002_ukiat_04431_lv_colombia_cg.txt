                             DECISION ON APPEAL

Mr N Jayawardhena (solicitor, Nimal Jay & Co) for the appellant
Mr S Ouseley for the respondent

  This is an appeal from a decision of an  adjudicator  (Mr  LV  Waumsley),
  sitting at Bromley on 27 March, dismissing an  asylum  and  human  rights
  appeal by a citizen of Colombia, from removal directions  as  an  illegal
  entrant on 16 March 2001. In the grant of leave, the point was taken that
  no destination had been specified in the removal directions.  While  that
  was regrettable, it seemed to us  that  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
  Appeal, sitting as a Divisional Court, in Hwez  (CO-2090-01)  meant  that
  there was nevertheless an appealable decision, which had to be considered
  on the merits of the appellant's claim for asylum  (or  protection  under
  the Human Rights Convention): there has never been any  question  of  her
  being removed to anywhere other than Colombia. Leave  was  given  on  the
  basis of a UNHCR letter about internal flight in Colombia, dated as  long
  ago as 22 December 1997.


2. These were the adjudicator's relevant findings of fact:

19. I am prepared to accept that if the appellant  were  to  return  to  her
   home town of Caloto, and if her  presence  there  were  to  come  to  the
   attention of the members of the paramilitary  group  who  threatened  her
   previously because of her suspected links with FARC, there would then  be
   a real risk that she might be killed or harmed in some other way by those
   paramilitaries. However, there is of course no obligation on the part  of
   the appellant to return to her home area  where  she  is  known.  On  the
   contrary, she has the whole of the rest of Colombia in  which  she  could
   relocate. In particular, she could consider moving to one of  the  larger
   cities, such as the capital, Bogota.
20. On the evidence before me, it is clear that if  the  appellant  were  to
   relocate to some other part of Colombia well away from her  hometown,  it
   is extremely unlikely (to put it  at  its  highest)  that  she  would  be
   recognised by anyone who knew her previously before  her  departure  from
   Colombia some 2% years ago. She is not a well-known political  or  public
   figure. On the contrary, she is just an ordinary individual from a  small
   town who has never been involved in  any  form  of  political  or  public
   activity. She would therefore just be another anonymous individual if she
   were to relocate to some other part of the country.
21. No suggestion has been made on the appellant's behalf that it  would  be
   unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect her to relocate to some other part
   of Colombia if she is unwilling, for understandable reasons, to return to
   her own home town. She is still a  relatively  young,  able-bodied  woman
   with no family commitments. I am therefore satisfied that it would not be
   unreasonable or unduly harsh to expect her to relocate to some other part
   of Colombia where she would be safe from the members of the  paramilitary
   group who threatened her previously in her home town.

3. The evidence on which these conclusions were based  was  as  follows:  we
  should perhaps say to help adjudicators that they need not employ  oratio
  obliqua ["she states"] where that can be understood from the context.

7. The appellant states that prior to  her  departure  from  Colombia,  she
   lived in a small town called Caloto. In 1997, she rented out two of  the
   rooms in her home to a man called Luis Carlos Arango.
8. About two years later, a military patrol was attacked near  Caloto,  and
   some of the soldiers were injured. Shortly afterwards, on 2 August 1999,
   the police started raiding all the houses in Caloto  on  suspicion  that
   local people had informed the guerrillas who had attacked  the  military
   patrol. When the police searched the room in the appellant's home  where
   Luis Carlos Arango slept, they found some documentation which they  said
   was evidence that he was a member of FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of
   Colombia), one of the major guerrilla groups in Colombia. The  appellant
   was  then  arrested,  and  was  taken  to   the   police   station   for
   interrogation. She states that she was threatened, had cold water thrown
   over her, and was hit with a stick when she started falling asleep.  The
   police wanted to know about her contacts with the guerrillas.
9. The appellant states that some of her neighbours vouched on  her  behalf
   to the police, and that she was then released without charge after being
   detained for about three to five days.  However,  she  was  required  to
   report to the police on a daily basis, and duly did so.
10. The appellant states that about two or three weeks later, on  23  August
   1999, a notice was put up in the main street of Caloto by members  of  a
   paramilitary group naming about ten to twelve individuals who were to be
   killed because they had assisted the guerrillas.  The  appellant's  name
   was amongst those who were on the death list.
11. The appellant states that the local priest in Caloto told  her  that  he
   was making arrangements for the safe departure of those individuals  who
   were named on the death list. He offered to take the appellant with him.
   She accepted immediately, and went to Santander two  days  later  on  25
   August 1999. She remained there for two days before moving on  to  Cali,
   which is about one hour from Caloto by bus.
12. The appellant states that she remained  in  Cali  for  about  one  month
   before leaving Colombia with the assistance of a paid agent. She kept  a
   low profile during that period. She left Colombia on  10  October  1999,
   and entered the United Kingdom clandestinely two days later. She  states
   that she fears that if she were now to return  to  Colombia,  she  would
   still be at risk from  the  members  of  the  paramilitary  group  which
   threatened  her  previously  because  they  believed  wrongly  that  she
   supported or otherwise assisted the FARC guerrilla group.


4. The  UNHCR  letter  on  which  leave  was  given  is  from  their  deputy
   representative in this country to someone at the  Refugee  Council.   The
   view  is  expressed  that  "there  is  no  realistic   'internal   flight
   alternative' in Colombia for Colombians  with  a  well  founded  fear  of
   persecution.   UNHCR  knows  of  no  safe  havens  in   Colombia."    The
   adjudicator's decision was not of course based on the  existence  of  any
   specific "safe havens", as can be  seen  from  the  passage  quoted.   Mr
   Jayawardhena also relied on a UNHCR position paper of February 1999;  but
   that does not deal specifically with Colombia at all.  It does  not  take
   account of the decision of the Court of Appeal in Robinson [1997] Imm  AR
   568, which is the  leading  expression  of  this  country's  law  on  the
   subject, and we do not find it of any particular help.

5. Mr Jayawardhena went on to suggest that it was for  the  Home  Office  to
   show that there was somewhere in Colombia to where it would not be unduly
   harsh to expect the appellant to return. We see no warrant  for  that  in
   Robinson, which leaves it to the adjudicator to make an overall  judgment
   of the reasonableness of return. What needs to be shown in any individual
   case will be a matter of evidence, relating to  its  relevant  individual
   circumstances. Returning to those in the present one, they  can  be  seen
   from the adjudicator's � 10, set out at � 3 above.

6. We put it to Mr  Jayawardhena  that,  if  the  para-militaries  chose  to
   advertize their intentions by publishing this appellant's  name,  amongst
   others, on a list in a public place, then those intentions must have been
   directed towards frightening her into leaving the neighbourhood: if  they
   had been planning direct action, no purpose would  have  been  served  by
   issuing a warning.  If  what  the  para-militaries  wanted  was  for  the
   appellant to leave the area where they thought  she  had  given  aid  and
   comfort to the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de  Colombia),  then
   the corollary must surely be that, if she did leave the area, then  their
   interest in her would cease? This interpretation of  events  is  to  some
   extent supported by the priest's actions in arranging internal flight for
   those concerned.

7. Mr Jayawardhena  relied  on  a  decision  of  this  Tribunal  in  Asevedo
   [01/TH/01397]. They took the view that, because of the system of identity
   card registration in force, an appellant who had been a relatively  high-
   profile human rights and trade union activist in his home town could  not
   reasonably be expected to seek internal flight: even if he would  not  be
   sought out and persecuted elsewhere, he would have "a  long-standing  and
   genuine subjective fear of what would happen  if  the  police  and  para-
   militaries found  them  [him  and  his  paramour]  and  discovered  [his]
   history". Leaving aside the correctness or otherwise of basing a Robinson
   decision on a subjective, rather than a reasonably based "objective" view
   of the situation, that is a long way  from  this  case.  The  only  other
   published material on which Mr Jayawardhena relied is to be found in  the
   CIPU report at A67, where reports of collaboration between the police and
   para-militaries are discussed; and at C49, where  there  is  evidence  of
   general lawlessness by government forces and para-militaries.

8.  There  is  however  a  letter  from   UNHCR   (the   well-known   deputy
   Representative in this country) dated 17  July  2001,  addressed  to  the
   Tribunal dealing with Asevedo (which it  may  suggest  should  have  been
   spelt Acevedo). Since the letter had been considered by the  Tribunal  in
   that case, we agreed to look at it, even though it had not been filed and
   served in accordance with the standard directions. There is a great  deal
   of discussion of the general law on the subject: we  have  to  say  again
   that this is not a useful purpose for such communications. If UNHCR have,
   as they sometimes do, something serious to say about the  law,  then  the
   Rules allow them to apply to intervene and  be  represented  by  counsel,
   whose professional judgment should keep his submissions confined to  what
   is relevant to the case in hand.

9. The interesting part of a letter  of  this  kind,  given  that  UNHCR  is
   represented in Colombia by a number  of  field  offices  (as  Mr  Ouseley
   pointed out from the map he produced), would have been some attempt at an
   up-to-date assessment of the position on the ground there.  There  is  no
   sign of that at all: instead the writer contents himself with reiterating
   the position previously taken, last put before us in the form of the 1997
   letter. This is distinctly jejune: we have quoted the entire substance of
   it at � 4; and  the  general  effect  of  UNHCR's  contributions  is  not
   helpful, because it does not bear on the issues in this case.

10. Conclusions  This appellant, unlike Acevedo, had no public r�le at  all:
   her whole case is based on a mistaken assumption by  the  para-militaries
   that she was a supporter of FARC. While  that,  as  the  adjudicator  was
   prepared  to  accept,  might  have  given  her  a  well-founded  fear  of
   persecution or breach of human rights if she had stayed in her home town,
   Colombia is a rugged country of considerable  size  and  population.  The
   conduct of the para-militaries themselves in putting her name on a public
   notice, following the termination of police action against her, does  not
   to us suggest that they can have had anything more in mind  than  driving
   her out of town. Having succeeded in that aim, there is nothing  to  show
   that they would have been interested in tracking her down  anywhere  else
   in Colombia, whether or not they could have got the help of the police in
   doing so; though that in itself appears unlikely, after her release.  The
   appellant herself does not suggest that anything happened  to  alarm  her
   during her month in the city of Cali: if she kept  a  low  profile  there
   (see the adjudicator's � 11, set out at � 3 above), that appears to  have
   been no more than she was used to doing in any event. In  our  view,  the
   adjudicator was fully justified in not regarding it as  unduly  harsh  to
   expect this appellant to return to some other part of Colombia  than  her
   home town.
