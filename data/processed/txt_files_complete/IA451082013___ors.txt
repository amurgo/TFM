          Notice of withdrawal of case pursuant to paragraph 17 of
       The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (as amended)

1. The appellants were granted permission to appeal  a  decision  dismissing
   their appeal against decisions of the Secretary of State refusing to vary
   their leave to remain.

2. A hearing on 2nd June 2014 was adjourned  to  enable  the  respondent  to
   take further instructions. By letter dated 16th July 2014 the appellants'
   legal representatives sought withdrawal of their appeals on  the  grounds
   that the principal applicant had been granted leave to remain in  the  UK
   as a Tier 2 Skilled worker and the  dependants  are  in  the  process  of
   applying for leave in line.

3. The Tribunal consents to the withdrawal of  the  case  before  the  Upper
   Tribunal under Rule 17 of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure)
   Rules 2005 (as amended).
