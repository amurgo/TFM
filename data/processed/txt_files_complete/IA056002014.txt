Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr J Siri, Counsel, instructed by Montas Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. On 5 September 2014 the First-tier Tribunal determined an appeal by  Ms
    Yetunde Smith against the  Secretary  of  State,  in  which  the  judge
    dismissed an appeal under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006 as amended ("the EEA  Regulations")  but  allowed  the
    appeal on human rights grounds pursuant to Article 8 of the ECHR.  That
    decision was the subject of an appeal to Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  I
    A Lewis and on 9 January 2014 the decision was set aside for a material
    error of law. We now have to remake the decision.

 2. Ms Smith was born on 12 October 1970 and is a citizen of  Nigeria.  Her
    evidence to the First-tier Tribunal was that she  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2004 on her honeymoon with her husband on a visit  visa  but
    the relationship subsequently broke down.  She returned to Nigeria  and
    came back in 2007 with the intention of seeking employment in order  to
    support her two children in Nigeria.  She  was  arrested  in  2007  and
    convicted of working here without permission. That resulted in a prison
    sentence of some five months.

 3. She remained  in  the  United  Kingdom  on  her  release  and  began  a
    relationship with a man who is now the father of her 2� year  old  son,
    Emmanuel. That relationship, she said, did not last  and  in  fact  the
    father left her before Emmanuel was even born, saying  that  he  wanted
    nothing to do with her or the child. Despite that, he was registered as
    the father in due course and assisted with the registration. They  also
    completed together a British  passport  application  for  Emmanuel.  Ms
    Smith's evidence to the First-tier Tribunal was that was the last  time
    she saw the father, that she no longer had his phone number and she had
    no idea where he was.

 4. The First-tier Judge did not accept that  evidence.  He  considered  it
    significant  that  the  father,  Mr  Adeyamo,  had  assisted  with  the
    registration of the birth over five months after it took  place,  which
    indicated some continuing contact.  He  considered  that  the  fact  of
    registration indicated at least that the father was  prepared  to  have
    something to do with Ms Smith and their son. It was the doubt as to the
    extent of any such contact which led the First-tier Judge to refuse the
    appeal under Regulation 15A(4A)(a)-(c) of the EEA Regulations. He  said
    that he was not satisfied to the necessary standard that, if  Ms  Smith
    had to leave, Emmanuel would be unable to reside in the United  Kingdom
    or in another EEA country.

 5. However, he found and the Secretary of State has accepted today that Ms
    Smith is the primary carer of Emmanuel who is  a  British  citizen.  He
    said that Ms Smith "is  the  person  with  primary  responsibility  for
    Emmanuel's care on the basis that she appears to take him to school, to
    the doctor and to church and that she deals  with  Lewisham  Children's
    Social Care". He found also that Emmanuel, then aged 2� and  a  British
    citizen born here, had spent his whole life here  and  had  never  been
    separated from his mother who took care of him. He attended  pre-school
    and his mother wanted him to be brought up in the United Kingdom  where
    he would have better opportunities than in Nigeria, whereas if he  went
    to Nigeria he might well lose touch with his connection to this country
    of which he is a citizen.

 6. On that basis the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  concluded,  despite  his
    decision under the EEA Regulations, that it was uncertain what  contact
    there was with Emmanuel's British father. He was  unable  to  say  that
    there was no contact but he did not make any finding as to  the  extent
    of any contact. He concluded on balance that it would be in  Emmanuel's
    best interests to remain in the United Kingdom with his mother.

 7.  In  the  light  of  that  finding  he  considered  the   question   of
    proportionality under Article 8 and the position of Ms  Smith,  setting
    out the various factors which he had  to  weigh.  Having  done  so,  he
    concluded that the Secretary of State's decision was not  proportionate
    when  balanced  against  Emmanuel's  interests  which  were  a  primary
    consideration.  On that basis he found that the appeal succeeded  under
    Article 8.

 8. There has been no challenge to the determination that the  requirements
    of  Regulation  15A(4A)  were  not  satisfied.  This  appeal  has  been
    concerned only with the position under Article 8. It is apparent and is
    realistically accepted by Mr Walker on behalf of the Secretary of State
    for whose assistance we are  grateful,  that  in  practical  terms  the
    choice is between sending both mother and child to Nigeria or  allowing
    both to remain here. In circumstances where there are no findings as to
    contact with the father, it would not be realistic in our  judgment  to
    expect for the purpose of weighing up the position under Article 8 that
    it would be realistic or  desirable  for  Emmanuel  to  live  with  his
    father.

 9. In those circumstances Mr Walker accepted that Ms Smith is the  primary
    carer for this young child; that as a British citizen he could  not  be
    removed  from  the  United  Kingdom;  that  pursuant  to  the  Zambrano
    principle it would not be reasonable to require the child, as a citizen
    of the European Union to relocate outside the EU to  Nigeria  with  his
    mother (Sanade and others (British children - Zambrano - Dereci) [2012]
    UKUT 00048 (IAC)); that any consideration of removal of  the  Appellant
    would therefore require to be premised on separation of mother and son;
    and that given those circumstances it is  difficult  to  say  that  the
    judge reached the wrong conclusion under Article 8. That,  as  we  have
    said, was realistic in the circumstances  and  on  the  findings  made.
    Although  there  was  some  tension  between  the  finding  under   the
    Regulation and the finding under Article 8 which gave rise to a lack of
    clarity (and  hence  an  error  of  law)  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision, it is clear looking at the case overall in terms of Article 8
    that the conclusion reached by  the  First-tier  Judge  was  the  right
    conclusion. That is so despite Ms Smith's poor immigration history  and
    the public interest considerations identified in (the new) section 117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration & Asylum Act 2002.

10. Accordingly we remake the decision so as to  allow  Ms  Smith's  appeal
    under Article 8.

11. We understand that a new application has been made for a residence card
    under the Regulations which the Secretary of State has acknowledged  by
    letter dated 23 February 2015.  If  Ms  Smith  wishes  to  pursue  that
    application, it will have to take its course. That matter is not before
    us.


NOTICE OF DECISION

The appeal of Ms Smith is allowed on human rights grounds.

The appeal under the EEA Regulations remains dismissed.

No anonymity direction is sought or made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As we have allowed the appeal and because a  fee  has  been  paid,  we  have
considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award.  This
is because the basis upon which the appeal has been allowed formed  no  part
of the Appellant's original application.



Signed        Date 19 March 2015
