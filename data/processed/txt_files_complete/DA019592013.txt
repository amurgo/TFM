Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Wilding a Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Lee of Counsel Lawrence & Co Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home  Department  ("the
    Secretary of State"). The respondent is a citizen of Colombia  who  was
    born on 27 May 1968 ("the claimant)". On 23 July 2008 the Secretary  of
    State decided that the deportation of the claimant would  be  conducive
    to the public good pursuant to section  3(5)  of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971. On 26 July 1999 she pleaded guilty at Middlesex  Crown  Court  to
    the supply of 1 kg  of  cocaine  and  she  was  sentenced  to  8  years
    imprisonment. She was released from prison in 2003.

 2. The claimant appealed the Secretary of State's decision and her  appeal
    was heard and allowed on Article 8 human rights grounds by a  panel  of
    the First Tier Tribunal comprising First-Tier Tribunal Judge Widdup and
    Sir Jeffrey James KBE CMG (non-legal member) ("the FTTJ").

 3. The Secretary of State appealed that decision arguing that there was  a
    material error of law. Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was
    granted. I heard the appeal sitting with Lord Boyd. We found that there
    was a material error of law. We allowed the Secretary of State's appeal
    and set aside the decision. Our decision and reasons is set out in  the
    Appendix to this determination.

 4. The appeal now comes back before me for the decision to be re-made.  Mr
    Lee informed me that no new evidence would be  submitted  and  no  oral
    evidence called. Both representatives agreed that the hearing would  be
    limited to submissions. The claimant  attended  the  hearing  with  her
    partner and members of her family and friends.

 5. Mr Lee submitted a skeleton argument  and  Mr  Wilding  relied  on  the
    skeleton argument submitted by the Presenting Officer at  the  previous
    hearing before us entitled "remaking the decision". I was provided with
    the judgement in YM (Uganda) v SSHD [2014] EWCA 1292.

 6. Mr Lee relied on his skeleton argument. Both he and Mr Wilding accepted
    that both the Immigration Rules and the Immigration Act 2014 which came
    into effect on 28 July 2014 must be applied in determining this appeal.
    In relation to section 117B the claimant speaks fluent English. She  is
    financially independent and has at all times been in  the  UK  legally.
    For most of that time her status has not been precarious. She  has  had
    indefinite leave to remain and the sentencing  judge  did  not  make  a
    recommendation for deportation. I note that the last statement does not
    appear to be correct. The transcript of the sentencing remarks records,
    in relation to  the  claimant;  "I  also  recommend  your  deportation,
    because your continued presence in this country  is  not  desirable  in
    view of your involvement in drugs in this matter." Section 117B(6) does
    not apply. It is accepted that sections 117C(1) (2) and  (3)  apply  so
    that it is necessary to consider whether Exceptions 1 and 2  apply.  If
    they do not then the claimant  needs  to  show  that  there  are  "very
    compelling circumstances". He submitted that she had done so. He relied
    on our findings as to the delay by the Secretary of State.  During  the
    periods of delay the claimant had been able to build up her private and
    family life  and  also  a  longer  period  during  which  she  had  not
    reoffended.

 7. Mr Lee submitted that, when weighing up the public interest as  against
    the claimant's circumstances,  there  had  been  a  significant  period
    following her release from detention exacerbated and  extended  by  the
    inaction and delay on the part of the Secretary of State. The Secretary
    of State could have signed a deportation order but for no clear  reason
    had never done so. During this period the  claimant  got  on  with  her
    life. The Secretary of State had not done anything which  entitled  her
    to say that the claimant should have left the country because she still
    had indefinite leave to remain. The total delay  by  the  Secretary  of
    State in this case was more than nine years. This began in 2003 on  the
    claimant's  release  from  prison  and  continued  notwithstanding  the
    decision in July 2008. The claimant's appeal rights were not  exhausted
    in May 2009 and the delay did not come to an end until the new decision
    of 12 September 2013. All this, Mr Lee submitted,  had  a  considerable
    effect on the public interest. The claimant came here in 1977  or  1978
    when she was nine years old. It was clear that she was settled here.  I
    was referred to JO at page 143 of the claimant's bundle and the extract
    from Maslov.  Mr  Lee  argued  that  the  new  Rules  reflected  Maslov
    principles, but only partially. "Very compelling circumstances"  needed
    to be circumscribed by what was said in Maslov. All  this,  he  argued,
    made  the  claimant's  case  a  special  one   with   very   compelling
    circumstances. Since her release from prison she had made a substantial
    contribution to society. I was taken to  the  passages  in  her  bundle
    which supported this contention. I was asked to allow the appeal.

 8. Mr Wilding relied on the skeleton put before us at  the  last  hearing.
    There was no obligation on the Secretary of State to sign a deportation
    order. If this had been done she would then have needed to consider and
    probably  refuse  any  application  by  the  claimant  to  revoke   the
    deportation order. Had she followed this  course  it  could  have  been
    argued that she had not  properly  considered  the  additional  factors
    submitted by the claimant which amounted to a fresh claim. They were in
    effect updating factors relevant to the notice of intention to  deport.
    If she had wished to prevent an in country right of  appeal  she  would
    have needed to certify her decision.

 9. Mr Wilding submitted that the reasons for refusal  letter  did  address
    the question of whether the Secretary of State  should  have  signed  a
    deportation order, from paragraph 19 to the end. The Secretary of State
    had followed correct and lawful procedures. The claimant needed to show
    very compelling circumstances under the provisions of the 2014 Act  and
    the Immigration Rules. This was a very significant  hurdle.  Whilst  he
    agreed with Mr Lee's assessment of most of the  provisions  of  section
    117B he did not  agree  that  the  claimant's  position  had  not  been
    precarious.

10. In relation to delay, Mr Wilding accepted that there had been delay. He
    accepted that this had strengthened the claimant's social and  personal
    ties in the UK from 2003. It did not assist to try and compartmentalise
    these periods. He accepted what we said in paragraphs 20 to 22  of  our
    earlier  decision  and  reasons.  Delay  was  not  a  very   compelling
    circumstance on its own, although it was a factor. It was easy to  fall
    into the trap of double counting. This was not a case like Maslov where
    the  offending  took  place  when  the  appellant  was  under  18.  The
    claimant's offence took place when she was 30 years of age. The  Maslov
    principles needed to read in the light of Balogun v. The United Kingdom
    - 60286/09 [2012] ECHR 614. In reply to my question as to whether there
    was a material difference between  "very  serious  reasons"  and  "very
    compelling circumstances" Mr Wilding said that  one  was  for  and  the
    other was against an individual but the differences were only a  matter
    of emphasis. Most of  the  Maslov  factors  were  in  Exception  1.  He
    submitted that in this case  the  claimant  had  not  established  very
    compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those  set  out   in   the
    Exceptions. I was asked to dismiss the appeal.

11. In his reply Mr Lee submitted the Maslow principles did apply and  that
    very serious reasons were required to justify deporting the  appellant.
    Some of the Maslow criteria were reflected  in  section  117C.  "Lawful
    residency" was a purely mathematical test the elements of which  needed
    to be assessed. He rejected the submission that there was  any  element
    of double counting.

12. I reserved my determination.

13. Mr Lee said that the claimant wished to address me. I  agreed  to  hear
    what she wanted to say. She accepted that she had committed a crime the
    circumstances of which would be clear to me. However, since her release
    from custody she had been productive in society  and  made  a  positive
    contribution. The long-running process had exacerbated  her  ill-health
    and she had attempted to take her  own  life.  She  had  mental  health
    problems and found it difficult to function. She deeply regretted  what
    she had done and at that time she had been oblivious to the effects  on
    society. Because of the work she now did she had become well  aware  of
    this. She no longer had any family or connections in South America  and
    would be unemployable. All her family were here and her life would fall
    apart without them. She spoke English better than Spanish.

14. In paragraphs 15 of YM Uganda Aikens LJ helpfully set out  the  current
    and former provisions of the Immigration Rules;
         "The 2012 Rules were modified by Statement of Changes to the
         Immigration Rules of 10 July 2014 (HC 532) which were laid before
         Parliament on 10 July 2014. I will call these the 2014 Rules. I
         have set out below the relevant 2012 Rules, as amended by the 2014
         Rules. I have put the new 2014 provisions in square brackets and I
         have crossed through the provisions of the 2012 Rules which are
         deleted by the 2014 Rules, in the hope that both the 2012 Rules and
         the 2014 Rules modifications can be plainly seen:
         A362. Where Article 8 is raised in the context of deportation under
         Part 13 of these Rules, the claim under Article 8 will only succeed
         where the requirements of these rules as at [28 July 2014] are met,
         regardless of when the notice of intention to deport or the
         deportation order, as appropriate, was served.'

         ...

         397. A deportation order will not be made if the person's removal
         pursuant to the order would be contrary to the UK's obligations
         under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights Convention. Where
         deportation would not be contrary to these obligations, it will
         only be in exceptional circumstances that the public interest in
         deportation is outweighed.

         [A.398. These rules apply where:

         (a) a foreign criminal liable to deportation claims that his
         deportation would be contrary to the United Kingdom's obligations
         under Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention;

         (b) a foreign criminal applies for a deportation order made against
         him to be revoked.]

         398. Where a person claims that their deportation would be contrary
         to the UK's obligations under Article 8 of the Human Rights
         Convention, and (a) the deportation of the person from the UK is
         conducive to the public good [and in the public interest] because
         they have been convicted of an offence for which they have been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at least four years; (b)
         the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to the
         public good [and in the public interest] because they have been
         convicted of an offence for which they have been sentenced to a
         period of imprisonment of less than 4 years but at least 12 months;
         or (c) the deportation of the person from the UK is conducive to
         the public good [and in the public interest] because, in the view
         of the Secretary of State, their offending has caused serious harm
         or they are a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard
         for the law, the Secretary of State in assessing that claim will
         consider whether paragraph 399 or 399A applies and, if it does
         not, it will only be in exceptional circumstances that the public
         interest in deportation will be outweighed by other factors [the
         public interest in deportation will only be outweighed by other
         factors where there are very compelling circumstances over and
         above those described in paragraphs 399 and 399A.]

         399. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies
         if - (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with a child under the age of 18 years who is in the
         UK and (i) the child is a British citizen; or (ii) the child has
         lived in the UK continuously for at least the seven years
         immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision; and in
         either case (a) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
         leave the UK [it would be unduly harsh for the child to live in the
         country to which the person is to be deported]; and (b) there is no
         other family member who is able to care for the child in the UK [it
         would be unduly harsh for the child to remain in the UK without the
         person who is to be deported]; or (b) the person has a genuine and
         subsisting relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a
         British citizen, [or] settled in the UK, or in the UK with refugee
         leave or humanitarian protection, and (i) the person has lived in
         the UK with valid leave continuously for at least the 15 years
         immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision
         (discounting any period of imprisonment) and (ii) there are
         insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK [(i) the relationship was formed at a
         time when the person (deportee) was in the UK lawfully and their
         immigration status was not precarious; and (ii) it would be unduly
         harsh for that partner to live in the country to which the person
         is to be deported because of compelling circumstances over and
         above those described in paragraph EX.2 of Appendix FM; and (iii)
         it would be unduly harsh for that partner to remain in the UK
         without the person who is to be deported].

         399A. This paragraph applies where paragraph 398(b) or (c) applies
         if - (a) the person has lived continuously in the UK for at least
         20 years immediately preceding the date of the immigration decision
         (discounting any period of imprisonment) and he has no ties
         (including social, cultural or family ) with the country to which
         he would have to go if required to leave the UK; or (b) the person
         is aged under 25 years, he has spent at least half of his life
         living continuously in the UK immediately preceding the date of the
         immigration decision (discounting any period of imprisonment) and
         he has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the
         country to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.

         [(a) the person has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of
         his life; and (b) he is socially and culturally integrated in the
         UK; and (c) there would be very significant obstacles to his
         integration into the country to which it is proposed he is
         deported].

         399B. Where paragraph 399 or 399A applies limited leave may be
         granted for periods not exceeding 30 months. Such leave shall be
         given subject to such conditions as the Secretary of State deems
         appropriate. Where a person who has previously been granted a
         period of leave under paragraph 399B would not fall for refusal
         under paragraph 322(1C), indefinite leave to remain may be granted.

         [where an Article 8 claim from a foreign criminal is successful:

         (a) in the case of a person who is in the UK unlawfully or whose
         leave to enter or remain has been cancelled by a deportation order,
         limited leave may be granted for periods not exceeding 30 months
         and subject to such conditions as the Secretary of state considers
         appropriate;

         .......]

         [399C. Where a foreign criminal who has previously been granted a
         period of limited leave under this Part applies for further limited
         leave or indefinite leave to remain his deportation remains
         conducive to the public good and in the public interest
         notwithstanding the previous grant of leave.]

         [339D. Where a foreign criminal has been deported and enters the
         United Kingdom in breach of a deportation order enforcement of the
         deportation order is in the public interest and will be implemented
         unless there are very exceptional circumstances]."

15. The provisions of the Immigration Act 2014 set  out  where  the  public
    interest lies in paragraphs 117A, 117B, 117C and 117D as follows;

         "117A Application of this Part

         (1) This Part applies where a court  or  tribunal  is  required  to
         determine whether a decision made under the Immigration Acts-

         (a) breaches a person's right to respect  for  private  and  family
         life under Article 8, and

         (b) as a result would be unlawful under  section  6  of  the  Human
         Rights Act 1998.

         (2) In considering the  public  interest  question,  the  court  or
         tribunal must (in particular) have regard-

         (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in section 117B, and

         (b) in cases concerning the deportation of  foreign  criminals,  to
         the considerations listed in section 117C.

         (3) In subsection (2), "the public  interest  question"  means  the
         question of whether  an  interference  with  a  person's  right  to
         respect for private and family  life  is  justified  under  Article
         8(2).

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in  the
         public interest.

         (2) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

         (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3) It is  in  the  public  interest,  and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

         (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

         (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

         (a) a private life, or

         (b) a relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,  that  is
         established by a person at a time when the person is in the  United
         Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established  by
         a person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status  is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the

         United Kingdom.

         117C  Article  8:  additional  considerations  in  cases  involving
         foreign criminals

         (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.

         (2) The more serious the offence committed by a  foreign  criminal,
         the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.

         (3) In the case of a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
         sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years  or  more,  the
         public interest requires C's  deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
         Exception 2 applies.

         (4) Exception 1 applies where-

         (a) C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom for most  of
         C's life,

         (b) C is socially and culturally integrated in the United  Kingdom,
         and

         (c) there would be very significant obstacles  to  C's  integration
         into the country to which C is proposed to be deported.

         (5) Exception 2 applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
         relationship with a qualifying partner, or a genuine and subsisting
         parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the  effect  of
         C's deportation on the partner or child would be unduly harsh.

         (6) In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to  a
         period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public  interest
         requires   deportation   unless   there   are    very    compelling
         circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
         2.

         (7) The considerations in subsections (1) to (6) are  to  be  taken
         into account where a court or tribunal is considering a decision to
         deport a foreign criminal only to the extent that  the  reason  for
         the decision was the offence or offences for which the criminal has
         been convicted.

         117D Interpretation of this Part

         (1) In this Part-

         "Article 8" means Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
         Rights;

         "qualifying child" means a person who is under the age  of  18  and
         who-

         (a) is a British citizen, or

         (b) has lived in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous  period  of
         seven years or more;

         "qualifying partner" means a partner who-

         (a) is a British citizen, or

         (b) who is settled in the United Kingdom (within the meaning of the
         Immigration Act 1971 - see section 33(2A) of that Act).

         (2) In this Part, "foreign criminal" means a person-

         (a) who is not a British citizen,

         (b) who has been convicted in the United Kingdom of an offence, and

         (c) who-

         (i) has been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of at  least  12
         months,

         (ii) has been convicted of an offence that has caused serious harm,
         or

         (iii) is a persistent offender.

         (3) For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), a person subject  to  an
         order under-

         (a) section  5  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  (Insanity)  Act  1964
         (insanity etc),

         (b) section 57  of  the  Criminal  Procedure  (Scotland)  Act  1995

         (c) Article 50A of the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order  1986
         (insanity etc),

         has not been convicted of an offence.

         a period of imprisonment of a certain length of time-

         (a) do not include a person who has received a  suspended  sentence
         (unless a court subsequently orders that the sentence or  any  part
         of it (of whatever length) is to take effect);

         (b) do not include a person who has been sentenced to a  period  of
         imprisonment of that  length  of  time  only  by  virtue  of  being
         sentenced to consecutive sentences amounting in aggregate  to  that
         length of time;

         (c) include a person who is sentenced to detention, or  ordered  or
         directed to be detained, in an  institution  other  than  a  prison
         (including, in particular, a hospital or an institution  for  young
         offenders) for that length of time; and

         (d) include a person who is sentenced to imprisonment or detention,
         or ordered or directed to be detained, for an indeterminate period,
         provided that it may last for at least that length of time.

         (5) If any question arises for the purposes  of  this  Part  as  to
         whether a person is  a  British  citizen,  it  is  for  the  person
         asserting that fact to prove it."

16. I will adopt the description of the two sets of Rules in YM Uganda  and
    refer to them as the 2012 Rules and the 2014 Rules. The FTTJ heard  the
    appeal on 24 July  2014  and  correctly  applied  the  2012  Rules.  In
    paragraph 25 the FTTJ recorded, again correctly, that the provisions of
    the Immigration Act 2014 and the 2014 Rules  had  not  then  come  into
    effect. However, they are now in  force  and  as  both  representatives
    accept I must apply them in remaking the decision in this appeal

17. The FTTJ made clear and detailed findings of fact in paragraphs  23  to
    42 of the determination. These have not been disputed and I adopt them.
    There has been no material change in the situation since the hearing in
    July 2014 apart from the further passage of time.

18. The provisions of the 2014 Rules and paragraphs 117A,  117B,  117C  and
    117D of the Immigration Act 2014  mirror  each  other.  Paragraph  117A
    applies because I am required to determine whether  the  decision  made
    under the Immigration Acts breaches the claimant's right to respect for
    private and family life under Article 8 and would therefore be unlawful
    under section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998. I must have regard to the
    considerations in paragraphs 117B and 117C.

19.  Under  paragraph  117B  I  find  that  the  maintenance  of  effective
    immigration controls is in the public interest. The economic well-being
    of the UK is served because the claimant speaks  good  English  and  is
    financially independent. She came to the UK in 1977 when she  was  nine
    years old and has lived here ever since, a total of 38 years.  She  was
    granted indefinite leave to remain in September 1980.  That  leave  has
    never been revoked. It would only have been revoked if the Secretary of
    State had signed a deportation order, which has not been done. She  has
    built up her private life in this country over that lengthy  period.  I
    find that she would have been aware that  her  immigration  status  had
    become precarious at the time of the Secretary of State's  decision  in
    June 2008 although the delays by the  Secretary  of  State  since  then
    would  have  given  her  increasing  cause  to  rebuild  a  feeling  of
    permanence. Her relationship with Mr Sanchez is such that he is  not  a
    qualifying partner although I  agree  with  the  FTTJ  that  it  is  an
    important and developing part  of  her  private  life.  The  claimant's
    children are grown up and she  is  not  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child. The claimant  does  have
    an important relationship with her mother who suffers from dementia and
    familial relationships with her sister,  son  and  daughter-in-law  and
    grandchildren.

20. By reason of paragraph 117C I find that the deportation of the claimant
    is in the public interest. She committed a very serious offence and was
    sentenced to more than four years imprisonment. As a result the  public
    interest requires her deportation  unless  there  are  very  compelling
    circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

21. I find that Exception 1 applies because the claimant has been  lawfully
    resident in the UK for most of her life. She is socially and culturally
    integrated in the UK. There would be very significant obstacles to  her
    integration into Colombia. She has not lived there for  38  years.  All
    her family and friends are here except for her father who has remarried
    and with whom she has  very  limited  contact.  She  has  no  remaining
    contacts in that country and would find it  very  difficult  to  obtain
    accommodation and employment.

22. Exception 2 does not apply because the claimant is not in a genuine and
    subsisting relationship with a qualifying  partner  or  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child

23. In line with MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and YM (Uganda) I find that the  2014  Rules  and
    paragraphs 117A, 117B, 117C and 117D of the Immigration Act 2014 are  a
    complete  code  for  dealing  with   a   person   in   the   claimant's
    circumstances. However, by analogy with what is said in paragraph 43 of
    YM (Uganda) I find that these cannot cover all the very many  different
    possible circumstances that might arise. In considering  whether  there
    are very compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
    Exceptions  1  and  2  I  must  take  into  account  all  the  material
    circumstances of the claimant's case. Apart from the fact that  one  is
    for and the other is against an individual  I  am  not  persuaded  that
    there is a material difference between  a  conclusion  that  there  are
    "very serious reasons" for deporting an individual and "very compelling
    circumstances" entitling him to remain so  long  as  all  the  material
    circumstances are taken into account including Maslov criteria which go
    beyond what is contained in Exceptions 1 and 2.

24. I adopt what we said in paragraphs 15 to 23 of our decision and reasons
    as to the extent and effect of the delay on the part of  the  Secretary
    of State. It is not clear why the Secretary of State decided, if indeed
    there was a conscious decision, not to sign the deportation order. Some
    explanations have been provided as to the possible  reasons  but  these
    are likely to be speculative and with the advantage of hindsight. There
    is insufficient evidence for me to reach any  clear  conclusion  as  to
    whether  the  Secretary  of  State  could  or  should  have  signed   a
    deportation order at any particular stage. What  is  clear  is  because
    this was not done the claimant has always been in this country  legally
    since she was granted indefinite leave to remain in 1980  and  probably
    before that.

25. It is clear that the claimant committed a very serious criminal offence
    resulting in eight years imprisonment. She had pleaded guilty.  As  the
    judge's sentencing remarks in August 1999 make clear she played a major
    role in the importation of 1 kg of  good  quality  cocaine  then  worth
    �25,000 at wholesale value and she must have been near to the source of
    these drugs in this country. He recommended that she  be  deported.  In
    these circumstances the public interest requires her deportation unless
    she can  show  very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2. She was released from prison  in  2003
    and has never reoffended.  After  that  length  of  time  the  risk  of
    reoffending must be very low. The Secretary of State did not start  any
    action in relation to possible deportation until June 2008. There  have
    been further delays since then. The claimant has built  up  a  stronger
    private life and family life ties over a total period of  approximately
    nine years between her release in 2003 and the decision under appeal in
    2013.

26. I find that, to the standard  of  the  balance  of  probabilities,  the
    claimant  has  established  that  the  low  risk  of  reoffending,  her
    rehabilitation and the extent to which her private and family life have
    grown over the period since her release and in  particular  during  the
    lengthy delays by the Secretary of  State  amount  to  very  compelling
    circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.

27. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction  and  can  see  no
    good reason to do so.

28. Having set aside the decision of the FTTJ I remake  that  decision  and
    allow the claimant's appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds.

    Upper Tribunal Judge Moulden

                                  Appendix

Introduction

1.    The appellant is the Secretary of State for the Home Department.  She
    appeals against a determination of the First Tier Tribunal comprising
    FTT Judge Widdup and Sir Jeffrey James KBE CMG (non-legal member)
    promulgated on 6 August 2014 allowing the appeal of Miss Nunez-Trejos.
    At issue was the Secretary of State's desire to deport Miss Nunez-
    Trejos.  The circumstances are set out more fully in the FTT's
    determination from paragraph 1 to 11 and we do not intend to repeat
    them here.  However, in essence, although the Secretary of State has
    taken the decision to deport Miss Nunez-Trejos a deportation order has
    not been signed and Miss Nunez-Trejos still enjoys indefinite leave to
    remain (ILR).

2.    The operative decision against which the appeal was considered
    followed on an application for leave to remain made by solicitors
    acting for Miss Nunez-Trejos on 13 June 2012.  That was refused by the
    Secretary of State in a decision letter dated 12 September 2013.  The
    First Tier Tribunal having initially questioned the position with
    regard to the deportation order accepted that Miss Nunez-Trejos had a
    right of appeal against that decision on human right grounds.  No issue
    was taken before us on competency and both parties were content to
    proceed on the basis accepted by the FTT.

3.    We will refer to the appellant in this case as the Secretary of State
    and Miss Nunez-Trejos as the appellant as she was before the FTT.

4.    The appellant is a citizen of Colombia, who was born on 27 May 1968.
    She entered the UK in 1977 when she was aged 9.  She was accompanied by
    her mother and sister.  On 25 September 1980 she was granted ILR.  On
    26 July 1999, she pleaded guilty at Middlesex Crown Court to the supply
    of 1kg of cocaine.  She was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment.  The
    sentencing judge made a recommendation for deportation.  The appellant
    was released from prison in 2003.

5.    On 16 June 2008 the Secretary of State issued a notice of intention
    to deport.  That was withdrawn following an appeal and reissued on 23
    July 2008.  An appeal was dismissed on 4 March 2009.  An application
    for a High Court review was refused on 22 May 2009 and the appellant
    became appeal rights exhausted on the same day.

6.    On 13 June 2012, the appellant applied for further leave to remain.
    In doing so her solicitors said that if a deportation order had not
    been signed, such an application was unnecessary.  On 12 September 2013
    the Secretary of State accepted that the application amounted to a
    fresh human rights claim and refused the application.

The Appellant's Circumstances

7.    The FTT have found that the appellant has a long established private
    life in the UK which includes her work and her friendships.  She has a
    relationship with a Mr Sanchez which the FTT found may in time lead to
    their marriage.  They found that it was an important and developing
    part of her life.  She also plays an important role in the life of her
    mother who suffers from Dementia as well as in the lives of her sister,
    her son and daughter-in-law and her grandchildren.  The FTT found that
    those relationships form part of her family life and part of the
    extended family of her close relatives.  They found that Article 8 was
    engaged.

8.    The FTT further found that the appellant was now rehabilitated and
    she was of low risk of re-offending.  She undertakes work of a
    charitable nature and the FTT referred to various statements which they
    considered were supportive of her.

The FTT's Determination

9.    In reaching their determination the FTT considered that Immigration
    Rules 396-399A applied.  At paragraph 26 the FTT noted, correctly, that
    398(a) applied as the sentence imposed was one of more than 4 years.
    It noted, correctly, that it "will only be in exceptional circumstances
    that the public interest in deportation will be outweighed by other
    factors" but then incorrectly states that to be the position unless
    399(b) applies.  IR 399(b) only applies where the sentence is less than
    4 years.  However the FTT go on in paragraphs 27 and 28 to say why on
    the facts 399(b) does not apply in this case.  As Mr Lee put it, having
    got themselves into a cul-de-sac, the FTT managed to get themselves
    out.

10.   The FTT also noted that it was inevitable that such social and
    cultural ties such as the appellant has with Colombia have weakened
    over the years and would have weakened further in the 5� years since
    the 2009 decision.  The appellant's immediate family are in the UK save
    for her father who has remarried.  The FTT accepted that she has little
    contact with him now.  The appellant has not been to Colombia for 15
    years.

11.   The FTT also noted evidence about the aggravation to the appellant's
    health said to have been caused by those proceedings.  They conclude
    that her clinical symptoms have not deteriorated since 2009 (paragraph
    38).  We note that the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in 2009
    concluded that there was no evidence that the appellant could not
    receive mental health support in Colombia.  The FTT did not comment on
    this matter.

12.   The FTT then turned to the issue of delay.  They rejected the
    Secretary of State's assertion that the appellant could not be traced;
    they found that she has lived at the same address for 15 years.  The
    FTT found that there was no explanation, reasonable or otherwise, for
    the delays in this case.  They had considered the case of EB Kosovo v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department 2008 UK HL 41.  They
    considered that the delay firmly impacted on the proportionality of the
    decision.  They then said after paragraphs 43 and 44 the following:

          "If the public interest fell firmly in favour of deportation in
         2009 making the decision then proportionate the absence of any
         action by the respondent to protect the public by deporting the
         appellant and thereby deterring others, makes deportation now far
         less proportionate.  Nothing we have said in this determination
         should be read as meaning that we have overlooked the seriousness
         of this offence or the public interest in the deportation of
         serious offenders.  However there must come a time when that public
         interest is outweighed by particular and individual circumstances
         relating to an appellant.  We are driven to the conclusion that in
         this case those circumstances, namely her strengthened private and
         family life and her apparent rehabilitation, combined with the
         inordinate and inexcusable delay makes this decision clearly
         disproportionate and that this is therefore an exceptional case
         which should succeed on human rights grounds."

Submissions for Secretary of State

13.   The Secretary of State submitted lengthy grounds of appeal.  Mr
    Jarvis relied on those together with supplementary written submissions.
     Part of these submissions related to the FTT's approach to the
    Immigration Rules to which we have already referred.  The Secretary of
    State submitted that the FTT had been in error in its approach to
    exceptional circumstances.  There was nothing in her private life or
    employment history that amounted to exceptional circumstances.  There
    was no evidence of insurmountable difficulties in the appellant
    carrying on her relationship in Colombia.  Family ties in the UK could
    be maintained by modern means of communication.  The FTT had not placed
    sufficient weight on the public interest in deporting those convicted
    of offences of more than 4 years.  The FTT had not properly addressed
    the effects of delay.  While it was accepted that the delay allowed the
    appellant to form deeper ties with the UK, she was always aware that
    her outstanding claim had not been assessed and that her immigration
    status was precarious.

Submissions for Appellant

14.   Mr Lee submitted that there was no material error in law.  The FTT
    had directed themselves to the seriousness of the offence and the
    public interest in deportation.  They had directed their minds to what
    were exceptional circumstances; the Secretary of State's ground of
    appeal left out the fact that the appellant had been in the UK since
    1977.  The FTT was correct to say that the public interest in
    deterrence could be outweighed and one of the factors was where the
    Secretary of State had taken no action to deport the appellant.  The
    issue was one of proportionality.  The appellant had enjoyed ILR to
    remain in the UK throughout.  The Secretary of State had indicated an
    intention to deport and then done nothing about it.

Decision

15.   We accept that the FTT was in error to consider that paragraph 399(b)
    of the Immigration Rules could apply.  However, as we have already
    indicated, nothing turns on this as, having considered the facts, the
    FTT found that it did not apply in this case.  It then went on to
    consider the issue of exceptional circumstances.  While the FTT do not
    say in terms what are exceptional circumstances, it is clear that they
    rely on a combination of three factors;  the strengthened private life
    (since the 2009 decision), the appellant's apparent rehabilitation and
    what the FTT describes as the inordinate and inexcusable delay.

16.   In EB Kosovo Lord Bingham of Cornhill in his speech pointed out that
    there was no specified time within which an immigration decision must
    be made.  There were three ways in which delay may have an effect on
    the decision.  First, the applicant may during the period of delay,
    develop closer, personal and social ties and establish deeper roots in
    the community.  Secondly, while relationships may have formed during
    this time, they may at first have been tentative because of being
    entered into under the shadow of severance by administrative order.  It
    may have a sense of impermanence.  However, as time passed without a
    decision being taken, that sense of impermanence would fade and give
    way to an expectation that if the authorities intended to remove the
    applicant, they would have done so earlier.  Thirdly, if the delay is
    shown to be the result of a dysfunctional system that yields
    unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair outcomes, then that would be
    relevant in reducing the weight to be accorded to the requirements of a
    firm and fair immigration control.

17.   The FTT concluded that during the further 5� years since the 2009
    decision, the appellant's personal and social ties to the UK had
    strengthened.  They were entitled to reach that conclusion on the
    evidence.  They were also entitled to have regard to what they saw as
    the appellant's rehabilitation.

18.   The third factor which forms part of the FTT's finding of exceptional
    circumstances is another aspect of delay; what they describe as an
    inordinate and inexcusable delay.  It is this combined with the two
    other factors which the FTT find to form exceptional circumstances.
    There is no doubt that there was a very substantial period of delay
    between the appellant's release from prison in 2003 and the serving of
    the notice of intention to deport in 2008.  If, however, that is a
    factor, it would have been taken into account in the 2009
    determination.  The FTT reject, as they were entitled to do, the
    suggestion that during the period of 5� years between the 2009 decision
    and the application for leave to remain she could not be found.
    Accordingly they were entitled to reach the view that the delay between
    those two events was inexcusable.  They were also entitled to come to
    the view that the delay was inordinate particularly as, during this
    time, the appellant continued to have ILR.

19.   The issue is whether or not they were entitled to come to the view
    that it was properly a factor to be taken into account.  It should be
    observed that the FTT had already found that one of the three factors
    was a strengthened private and family life which came about as a result
    of the delay.  Accordingly the FTT clearly took the view that the
    inordinate and inexcusable delay was a factor in itself which in
    combination with the other factors could be set against the public
    interest in deportation.

20.   We consider that the FTT was in error in stating that the absence of
    action by the Secretary of State to protect the public by deporting the
    appellant and thereby deterring others makes deportation now far less
    proportionate.  While delay as a result of what Lord Bingham described
    as a dysfunctional system can be a factor, it is only where such delays
    may throw up results which are unpredictable, inconsistent and unfair.
    In EB Kosovo the appellant's cousin, who had entered the UK at the same
    time as the appellant had some time previously been granted ILR on the
    same facts and circumstances and within a reasonable period.  It was
    that comparative unfairness which was struck at.

21.   The public interest in deportation is not the same as the State's
    interest.  While the State may articulate and enforce that interest,
    the public interest does not wither merely because the bureaucracy of
    the State fails to take timeous decisions.  The interest goes beyond
    the protection of the public but also marks public abhorrence at such
    offending and the needs to maintain public confidence in the system of
    immigration control.  The appellant in this case was convicted of a
    very serious drugs offence for which she was sentenced to 8 years
    imprisonment.

22.   We do not consider that the decision here can be said to be
    unpredictable or inconsistent or unfair.  The only issue is a delay in
    taking it.  The FTT have already made an allowance for delay in finding
    that the appellant's persona and family ties have strengthened during
    this period.  They were not entitled in this case to make a further
    allowance for the delay because they disapproved of the Secretary of
    State's handling of the case.

23.   We consider that this error was material.  We note that it was the
    strengthening of the appellant's private life and her apparent
    rehabilitation combined with the inordinate and inexcusable delay that
    formed the basis of the FTT's determination.  We cannot say what their
    view might have been had they confined the consideration to the two
    other factors and set these against the public interest.  Accordingly
    we will allow the appeal.

Future Progress

24.   Mr Lee informed us that he would wish to consider calling further
    evidence.  He was neutral as to whether it would be better to keep it
    in the UT or remit back to the FTT.  Mr Jarvis considered that it would
    better to retain it within the UT.  We agree and we will set it down
    for a further hearing to remake the decision before the UT.
