Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr M Symes, instructed by Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 3rd August  1982.  His
    appeal against the refusal to vary leave as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    Migrant was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen on 12th  October
    2015.

2.   The Respondent appealed. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Heynes on the basis that it was arguable that the  judge
    had failed to give  adequate  reasons  and  made  no  findings  on  the
    Appellant's failure to meet the requirements of paragraph 41-SD(e)(iii)
    and (iv) of Appendix A.

3.   The appeal came before Upper Tribunal Judge Storey on  25th  May  2016.
    He found that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in  that,
    although the judge specifically identified  the  Secretary  of  State's
    concerns regarding paragraph 46-SD at paragraph 3 of his decision,  the
    judge failed to give any reasons why he disagreed save  in  respect  of
    the omission of the Appellant's name from  the  audited  accounts.  The
    consequence of this failure was that it was  impossible  to  understand
    why the judge had allowed the  appeal.  Accordingly,  having  found  an
    error of law, the decision was set aside and the matter came before  me
    for rehearing.

4.   At the outset of the hearing Ms Fijiwala indicated  that  there  was  a
    preliminary issue.  She accepted that paragraph 41-SD did not apply  in
    this case and the  only  issue  was  whether  the  Appellant  satisfied
    paragraph 46-SD(b).  Accordingly, the points made in the refusal letter
    at page 3 were not relevant in this appeal. Mr Symes submitted that  no
    oral evidence was necessary and that the matter could be dealt with  by
    submissions only.

5.   The Appellant's application was refused for the reasons given  at  page
    2 of the refusal letter:

         "The unaudited account for London School of Commerce and IT for the
         period 31st March 2014 and 1st August 2014 state yourself  and  Gul
         Meher as directors of your business.  They  show  called  up  share
         capital  of  �110,100.  However,  the  accounts  do  not  show  the
         investment in money made directly by you or the value of the shares
         held in your name.
         In addition, the accountant's letter that you  have  provided  from
         ABM Ashabul Hossain, ACPA, states that you acquired  37,800  shares
         in the company in exchange for �50,047.20 (1.234 [sic] for every �1
         share in the company).  However, this does not corroborate with the
         share certificate that you have provided which shows that you  hold
         37,800 shares at �1 each.
         We have therefore discounted the  amount  of  �50,047.20  from  our
         assessment of the funds that you claim to have access to.
         As a result we have calculated that  you  have  access  to  �37,800
         which is less than the �50,000 required for you to be  awarded  the
         points."


6.   Paragraph 46-SD(b) states:


         "Audited or unaudited accounts must show the  investment  in  money
         made directly by the applicant, in his own name or  on  his  behalf
         (and showing his name).  If he had invested by way of share capital
         the business accounts must show the shareholders,  the  amount  and
         value of the shares (on the date of purchase)  in  the  applicant's
         name as it appears  on  his  application.   If  the  value  of  the
         applicant's share capital is not shown in the accounts  then  share
         certificates  must  be  submitted  as  documentary  evidence.   The
         accounts must clearly show the name of the accountant, the date the
         accounts were produced and how much the applicant has  invested  in
         the business. The accounts must  be  prepared  and  signed  off  in
         accordance with statutory requirements."


7.   Ms  Fijiwala  submitted  that  the  Appellant  had  conceded  that  the
    accounts did not show investments made by him  in  his  name  and  that
    therefore if the value of the shares was not shown in the  account  the
    share  certificates  should  be  submitted.  The   share   certificates
    submitted show that there were 37,800 shares  registered  at  �1  each.
    This showed an investment of  37,800  and  not  the  �50,000  required.
    Further the accountant's letter provided, stating that the �1 share was
    a nominal value, was inadmissible under Section 85A. The Respondent was
    entitled to conclude that the Appellant had not  invested  �50,000  and
    that paragraph 46-SD(b) was not met. The evidential flexibility  policy
    did not apply since there was no document in existence showing that the
    Appellant had invested �50,000 and this evidence was not available from
    other documentation. Any  amended  documents  which  were  subsequently
    submitted would be inadmissible under Section 85A. This was not a  case
    where there was a missing document and therefore  paragraph  245AA  did
    not assist the Appellant.


8.   Mr Symes submitted that, although the unaudited accounts did  not  show
    the Appellant's name, the  documents  showed  that  the  Appellant  had
    invested �50,000.  The letter at page  29  of  the  bundle  showed  the
    amount of the share values. This letter was before  the  decision-maker
    and had either not been taken into account or was misunderstood.   This
    letter showed that the Appellant paid �1.324 for every �1 share and  it
    was evident that the Appellant had invested �50,047.20 in  the  company
    and therefore he met the required threshold of �50,000.


9.   Accordingly, having satisfied the amount of investment the  only  issue
    was that the unaudited accounts did not show the Appellant's  name.  It
    was therefore a situation where the application of 245AA was  relevant.
    Paragraph 245AA(d) states:


         "If the applicant has submitted a specified document:
         (i)  in the wrong format; or
         (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or
         (iii)    which does not contain all the specified information,  but
             the missing information is verifiable from:
             (1)  other documents submitted with the application,
             (2)   the  website  of  the  organisation  which  issued   the
                  document, or
             (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body;
         the application may be granted exceptionally, providing  the  Entry
         Clearance Officer, Immigration Officer or the Secretary of State is
         satisfied  that  the  specified  documents  are  genuine  and   the
         applicant meets all other requirements."


10.   Paragraph  245AA(d)  applied  to  the  Appellant's  case  because  the
    document submitted failed to contain  specified  information,  but  the
    missing information was verifiable from the letter from the  accountant
    which was before the Respondent (page 29). The  letter  is  dated  11th
    August 2014 and the decision is dated 13th  February  2015.   This  was
    clearly a document which was available at the  time  and  which  should
    have been taken into account by the Respondent in  her  application  of
    the evidential flexibility policy.

11.  Mr Symes submitted that where the  policy  was  applicable  the  normal
    course would be for the decision to go back  before  the  Secretary  of
    State to be re-made and allow her to exercise her discretion.  However,
    in a case such as this where there was no space for the  decision-maker
    to come to any other conclusion, then it was open to  the  Tribunal  to
    make the decision for itself.


Discussion and Conclusion

12.  Given that the Respondent has accepted that  paragraph  41-SD  was  not
    applicable in this case, the  only  issue  was  whether  the  Appellant
    satisfied paragraph 46-SD(b).  The matters referred to at page 3 of the
    refusal letter were accordingly irrelevant and I  am  solely  concerned
    with whether the Appellant's name  was  on  the  audited  accounts  and
    whether he had invested �50,000 in the business.


13.  Since the  audited  accounts  failed  to  demonstrate  the  Appellant's
    investment it was necessary for the Respondent to look elsewhere.   She
    did so and considered the share certificates which indicated the  value
    of the shares was �1. However, there was evidence before the Respondent
    from the accountant that the shares were purchased for �1.324 and  that
    is the letter dated 11th August 2014 (page 29). It states:


         "We write to confirm that we act as accountant and tax advisor  for
         London School of Commerce and  IT,  (Companies  House  registration
         number 06545902) which was incorporated in England and Wales  as  a
         limited company on 27th  March  2008.   We  also  confirm  that  MD
         Metahul Islam Chowdhury has acquired 37,800 shares in  the  company
         in exchange for �50,047.20,  �1.324  for  every  �1  share  in  the
         company."


14.  This evidence was before the Respondent  and  is  referred  to  in  the
    refusal letter.  Accordingly, the Respondent has  either  misunderstood
    the information or failed to  properly  take  it  into  account.  I  am
    satisfied that the Respondent erred in this respect and that there  was
    evidence before her that the Appellant had invested the required  level
    of funds in the business, namely  �50,047.20.  The  Appellant  met  the
    financial  threshold  and  was  entitled  to  the  points  awarded  for
    attributes in accordance with paragraph 45 of Appendix A.


15.  The difficulty that remains is  that  the  Appellant's  name  does  not
    appear in the audited accounts. However, this information was available
    from other evidence. I find that paragraph 245AA(d) of the  Immigration
    Rules applies. The accounts did not contain the Appellant's  name,  but
    his name was verifiable from  other  information  and  other  documents
    submitted with the application, namely the share certificate at page 35
    and the letter at page 29 explaining the value of shares on  the  share
    certificate. Accordingly, it was appropriate for the Secretary of State
    to exercise her discretion and apply paragraph 245AA.


16.  I am also satisfied that, in accordance with  AG  Kosovo  [2007]  UKAIT
    00082, this is a case where the Secretary of State  in  exercising  her
    discretion under paragraph 245AA could come to no other conclusion than
    that the Appellant satisfied the requirements of the Immigration Rules.
     I allow the Appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140 because there was evidence before the Respondent which  showed
that the Appellant satisfied the Immigration  Rules,  which  she  failed  to
take into account or misunderstood.
