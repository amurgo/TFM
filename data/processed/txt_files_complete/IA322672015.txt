                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born in May 1982. She arrived in
       the UK on 30th March 2003 as a  visitor.  On  7th  August  2006  the
       appellant married a Portuguese citizen [MR],  and  on  16th  October
       2009 she was granted an EEA residence card by the  respondent  as  a
       result of this marriage, as was her husband.  On 3rd March 2015  the
       couple were divorced.

    2. The appellant has two children the first of whom, born in  September
       2012, she says is the child of her husband. The second  child,  born
       in August 2014, she says is from another relationship. The appellant
       says her husband was violent to her, and it is notable that he has a
       criminal record of offences between 2011 and 2014, which resulted in
       him being deported to Portugal in December 2014.

    3. The appellant applied for a permanent right of residence  under  the
       EEA Regulations on the basis of this marriage, and it is the refusal
       of this application that gives  rise  to  this  appeal.  Her  appeal
       against the decision was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Raymond in a determination promulgated on the 31st March 2017.

    4. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Andrew on 31st May 2017 on the basis that it was arguable  that  the
       First-tier judge had erred in law as it is arguable that  he  failed
       to consider whether the appellant met the requirements of Regulation
       15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations, and instead erroneously  considered
       Regulation 10 of those Regulations.

    5. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    6. The appellant notes that the decision was not written by the  First-
       tier Tribunal Judge for over two months and  argues  that  this  may
       have contributed to the errors made in the decision.

    7. It is argued by the appellant that the First-tier Tribunal  did  not
       consider properly the argument of the appellant that she had  become
       permanently resident in the UK on 7th August 2011  under  Regulation
       15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations. The  appellant  accepted  that  she
       could not benefit from Regulation 10 of the EEA Regulations.  It  is
       argued that the appellant began to accrue residency via her marriage
       and her husband's exercise of Treaty rights from 7th August 2006 and
       thus had five years residence by 7th August 2011. The starting point
       for residency was not  therefore  October  2009  as  the  First-tier
       Tribunal assumes. Although the HMRC evidence does not  go  back  for
       more than five years, and so does not pre-date 2011, there was other
       evidence in the  appellant's  bundle  that  shows  her  husband  was
       working from 2008 as well as the oral  evidence  of  the  appellant,
       whom the First-tier Tribunal found to be  a  credible  witness.  The
       respondent had  accepted  the  appellant's  husband  was  exercising
       Treaty rights in 2008 (date of the evidence  provided  to  her)  and
       2009 when  she  issued  the  appellant  and  her  husband  residence
       permits. It was further not open to the First-tier Tribunal Judge to
       go behind  this  decision  of  the  respondent  without  giving  the
       appellant notice of his intention to do so.

    8. There is no Rule 24 notice from  the  respondent.  Mr  Bramble  said
       firstly in submissions that he was disadvantaged as he did not  have
       the presenting officer from the First-tier Tribunal hearing's notes.
       I was able to read him what was written on the record of proceedings
       at the beginning after recording the names  of  the  representatives
       which is as follows: "not issue of retained  rights  -  but  whether
       appellant  has  permanent  residency".  On  this  basis  Mr  Bramble
       accepted  that  there  had  been  a  legal  error  not  to  consider
       Regulation 15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA  Regulations  but  said  that  the
       respondent did not accept that this error was a material one.

    9. I then asked that the parties make submissions on  the  two  closely
       related issues as to whether there had been a material error of  law
       and whether the appellant was  entitled  or  not  to  succeed  under
       Regulation 15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA  Regulations,  and  thus  to  make
       submissions simultaneously  on  the  issues  of  error  of  law  and
       remaking. As it was not clear whether the appellant had  been  found
       to be credible generally I asked that she be called to give evidence
       so I could hear submissions on this issue. I did not set  aside  the
       findings of Judge Raymond in his decision on Regulation  10  of  the
       EEA Regulations as these were not contested to be wrong.  At the end
       of the hearing I reserved my determination.

Evidence and Submissions on Issue of Material Error of Law and  Remaking  it
there was such an Error

   10. Mr Abdar called the appellant to give evidence. She  confirmed  that
       her statement was true and correct to the best of her knowledge  and
       belief. In this statement, in summary, she says as follows. She  met
       her husband in November 2005, and they  started  dating  in  January
       2006. At this point she was very unhappy and was  living  unlawfully
       in the UK. She found her husband very sweet and caring, although she
       was aware he also had problems of his own  and  when  he  was  drunk
       would talk about issues with his father.

   11. On 7th August 2006 the appellant and her husband were  married,  and
       started cohabiting and living on her husband's earnings. Due to  his
       level of earnings they struggled to  pay  rent  in  London,  and  in
       February 2008 they moved together to Hemel Hempstead. The  appellant
       says they were very happy at this time.  Her  husband  worked  as  a
       cleaner at Chelsea stadium at Stamford Bridge,  which  she  believed
       was a job he had done since they met and before this. He worked as a
       security guard from 2008, and throughout the time of their  marriage
       had also been self-employed as a  barber  working  from  a  friend's
       barber's shop in  Camberwell,  London.  In  2008  they  applied  for
       residence cards, which  were  given  in  2009.  The  appellant  then
       started to work for the NHS as a nursing assistant, a job which  she
       has done ever since that time.

   12. The appellant's relationship with her husband began  to  deteriorate
       as when drunk he became physically and sexually abusive. Towards the
       end of 2011 she became pregnant but he did not want her to keep  the
       baby, and she discovered he was having an affair with someone  else.
       When she confronted him he punched her and she left the family home,
       and afterwards did not put his name on her son's birth  certificate.
       She then had a relationship with another man, and her  daughter  was
       born in 2014, however that relationship ended during  the  pregnancy
       as she discovered that man had a partner and other children  he  had
       not told her about. She realised that she would not be getting  back
       together with her husband in September 2014 and  so  applied  for  a
       divorce which was granted in March 2015.

   13. The appellant wishes to remain  in  the  UK  to  bring  up  her  two
       children and continue to work for the NHS.

   14. In oral evidence she added the following. That  her  husband  earned
       between �600 and �800 from his cleaning job at Stamford Bridge.  She
       could not remember the name of the cleaning company he  worked  for.
       He also did part-time barbering and painting and decorating, but she
       did not know how much he earned from this as he would not tell  her.
       The painting was at weekends in people's homes.  The  barbering  was
       when he was not working as a cleaner as sometimes that job was full-
       time and sometimes part-time. She did not have documentary  evidence
       about the cleaning job. He did these types of  work  for  the  whole
       period they cohabited from 2006 to 2011.  He  was  not  an  educated
       person.  She has worked in Whipps Cross Hospital  in  the  emergency
       surgery theatre since 2009. The problems in  the  relationship  came
       when her husband drank alcohol and became violent. She had moved out
       in November 2011 due to the physical and sexual abuse  he  subjected
       her too.

   15. The appellant said that she had first heard that he had  spent  time
       in prison when she called his brother in 2012. His brother  said  he
       had been in prison but at that time she did not want to believe this
       was true. She had called her husband's brother as her husband  would
       not allow her to contact him directly. She only knew for certain  he
       had been in  prison  when  she  received  the  respondent's  refusal
       letter. She had never personally had information about his  criminal
       convictions.

   16. Mr Bramble submitted that the appellant had to show that her husband
       had been in the UK exercising Treaty rights for a continuous  period
       of 5 years whilst they were married, and that  that  period  had  to
       finish by 13th September 2011 when he was convicted and sentenced to
       a term of imprisonment. He said that he accepted that the  appellant
       had shown that her husband had been exercising  Treaty  rights  from
       March 2008 to September 2011, but not  the  period  August  2006  to
       March 2008 as there  was  no  documentary  evidence  supporting  the
       contention that he worked and was self-employed during this  earlier
       period.  He submitted that the appellant should not  be  seen  as  a
       credible witness on this issue as she had  said  that  she  was  not
       aware of her husband's imprisonment until his brother raised  it  in
       2012, and even then did not believe it, and she  also  claimed  that
       she was living with him until November  2011.  If  her  husband  was
       imprisoned in September 2011 she would surely have noticed his going
       to court and being sent to prison. There was therefore  no  material
       error of law  in  not  examining  Regulation  15(1)(b)  of  the  EEA
       Regulations as  the  appellant  was  not  entitled  to  a  permanent
       residence permit.

   17. Mr Abdar submitted that it should be  accepted  that  the  appellant
       lived with her husband for five years  whilst  he  exercised  Treaty
       rights and was entitled to a  permanent  residence  permit.  It  was
       accepted by the respondent that her husband exercised Treaty  rights
       from March 2008 to September 2011. The period in dispute was  August
       2006 to March 2008. It has been said that there  is  no  documentary
       evidence of his work but this is  not  strictly  true.  There  is  a
       letter from HMRC dated 3rd February 2009 which indicates  that  HMRC
       had evidence that her husband had exercised self-employment  in  the
       past and should be making tax returns. This indicated that  for  the
       tax year April 2007 to April 2008 he must have  provided  them  with
       some evidence which triggered the sending of this letter.

   18. In addition the oral and  written  evidence  of  the  appellant  was
       credible. The appellant had a trusted job in  an  emergency  surgery
       room, and gave simple believable evidence about a young  couple  who
       lived together with the husband working to support them. It was also
       the case that the First-tier Tribunal had made  a  specific  finding
       that she was credible with respect of her account that  her  husband
       was  violent,  as  this  tallied  with  his  history   of   criminal
       convictions, when making findings under Regulation  10  of  the  EEA
       Regulations.

   19. Mr Abdar  also  submitted  that  it  was  not  incredible  that  the
       appellant would not know  if  her  husband,  who  was  already  away
       drinking and having an affair on a regular basis, had been to  court
       and been convicted of a criminal offence  on  13th  September  2011.
       Further, the sentence he received would appear to  have  been  a  10
       week suspended sentence at  that  point.  The  refusal  letter  then
       appears to state that during the period of this  suspended  sentence
       he reoffended and was given an 8 week sentence which he served. This
       could therefore have been at any point between  13th  September  and
       approximately the end of November 2011, and  thus  it  would  during
       that period he would have spent 4 weeks in prison. This is therefore
       consistent with the appellant being unaware of her husband  spending
       time in prison as it could have been that it took  place  after  the
       separation in November 2011, with the possibility that  it  was  not
       such a long period at one time as part could have  been  on  remand,
       followed by time on bail and then being taken back into  custody  to
       serve the rest of the sentence.

  Conclusions - Error of law and Remaking

   20. In the  case  of  Onuekwere  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
       Department (C -378/12) [2014] Imm AR 551 the Court of Justice of the
       European Union found that periods of imprisonment by a third country
       national cannot be taken into account for the  purpose  of  accruing
       five years lawful  residence  under  Article  16  of  the  Citizens'
       Directive and further that any periods of residence before and after
       a prison sentence cannot be aggregated. As a result it is clear that
       the clock stopped for the appellant's husband in terms of  acquiring
       permanent residence when he served his first prison sentence.

   21. The material about the first appellant's first period in  prison  in
       the refusal letter most easily reads that on the 13th September 2011
       he was given two sentences of imprisonment: one of 10 week  and  one
       of 8 weeks. It does  not  say  whether  these  ran  concurrently  or
       consecutively. As a result, the appellant's husband would have  been
       imprisoned for between 5 and 9 weeks at this point. Although  it  is
       possible, as Mr Abdar submits, that this was not all in one block as
       it could be that he was arrested and remanded, and then released  on
       bail for a period of time, and then served the  period  of  sentence
       less the time on bail. It is in any case clear that  any  period  of
       Treaty rights which results in the appellant  being  able  to  claim
       permanent residence must end on 13th September 2011.

   22. I find that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law at paragraph 14  of
       the decision by stating that the appellant  and  her  husband  could
       only have obtained permanent residence  by  living  in  the  UK  and
       exercising Treaty rights after October 2009 when they obtained their
       EEA residence permits. Clearly they could have obtained  this  right
       based on the exercise of Treaty rights prior  to  this  so  long  as
       there was a five year period in which there was sufficient  evidence
       that the appellant's husband exercised such rights. I also find that
       there was an unlawful  insufficiency  of  reasoning  given  for  the
       decision that the appellant was not entitled to permanent  residence
       under Regulation 15 at paragraph 22 of the decision, and for finding
       that there was no evidence at all of her  husband  having  exercised
       Treaty rights prior to the HMRC records as is recorded at paragraphs
       6 and 19 of the decision.

   23. I now go on to  assess  whether  these  errors  were  material,  and
       whether the appellant has shown that she can meet  the  requirements
       of Regulation 15(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations.

   24. As is clear from the above submissions Mr Bramble accepted  for  the
       respondent that the appellant had shown that that her husband was in
       employment between March 2008 and September 2011. The key period  in
       dispute is that from August 2006, when the appellant and her husband
       married and started to cohabit, until March 2008.

   25. I agree with Mr Abdar that the letter from HMRC to  the  appellant's
       husband dated 3rd February 2009 strongly implies that they  believed
       that he had done self-employed work in the tax year  April  2007  to
       April 2008, and possibly prior to this.

   26. I also find that the appellant should be seen as a credible witness.
       Judge Raymond had found her credible with  respect  to  the  violent
       history and breakdown of her relationship with her  husband.  Before
       me she answered all questions put to her carefully, indicating  when
       she did not understand them and being precise in  her  answers,  for
       instance in saying she had never personally  had  knowledge  of  her
       husband's  criminal  record  and  explaining  the  sources  of   her
       knowledge and how and when they came to her. She was  obviously,  if
       quietly, emotionally when she talked about his violence towards her.
        I find that given the state of her relationship by September  2011,
       which involved her husband drinking, being abusive to her and having
       an affair, and his having three jobs which included weekends and her
       full-time work as a care assistant at Whipps Cross Hospital, that it
       is credible that he could have attended court  and  been  imprisoned
       for a number of weeks prior to November 2011 without her  knowledge.
       It is also perhaps supportive of the appellant's evidence  that  she
       did not  notice  his  absence  at  this  time  that  his  period  of
       imprisonment was not such that he lost his job  with  Cleanevent  UK
       Limited, as this continued according to  the  HMRC  letter  of  15th
       August 2016 from 20th February 2009 to 6th August 2012.

   27. I find that the appellant's testimony that her husband worked on  an
       employed basis from  August  2006  to  March  2008  for  a  cleaning
       company, with his work being based at Stamford Bridge,  as  well  as
       doing part-time self-employed barbering and painting and  decorating
       to be credible and true. I find this as I find the appellant to be a
       generally credible witness as I have indicated above, and further  I
       find that this evidence is enhanced in its credibility  as  at  that
       point she had no right to work as a  Ghanaian  overstayer,  and  the
       pattern of work she says her husband took in this period is  clearly
       consistent with that which is evidenced by the documents  from  HMRC
       from 2009 onwards, which in turn indicate he did low skilled and low
       paid employed and self-employed work.

   28. I therefore  find  that  the  appellant  has  acquired  a  right  of
       permanent residence under Regulation  15(1)(b)  of  the  Immigration
       (EEA) Regulations 2016 as she was present in the UK with her husband
       who was exercising Treaty rights as an  employed  and  self-employed
       person for a continuous period between  6th  August  2006  and  13th
       September 2011 in the UK.



          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set the decision of the First-tier Tribunal aside.

   3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by  allowing  it  under  the  EEA
      Regulations as set out above.

    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    original appellant. This direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  all
    parties. Any failure to comply with this direction could give  rise  to
    contempt of court proceedings. I do so in order to avoid  a  likelihood
    of serious harm arising to the  appellant  or  her  children  from  the
    contents of this claim due to her husband's  history  of  violence  and
    criminal deportation.

Fee Award        Note: this is not part of the determination.

    In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by
    allowing it, I have considered whether to make a fee award. I have  had
    regard  to  the  Joint  Presidential  Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards   in
    Immigration Appeals. I have decided to make no fee award because it was
    clearly necessary to have the appeal hearing to  understand  the  legal
    basis of  the  appellant's  case  and  the  evidence  to  support  that
    argument.
