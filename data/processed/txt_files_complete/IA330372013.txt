                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1) The appellant is a citizen of Nepal, born on  2  March  1984.    She  had
   leave as a student, valid until 25 May 2012.  On 4 May  2012  she  sought
   further leave to remain outwith the provisions of the  Immigration  Rules
   on the basis that she was 38 weeks pregnant and unable  to  travel.   Her
   husband, also a citizen of Nepal, born on 29 March 1976, applied  as  her
   dependant.  By notices dated 22 July 2013  the  respondent  refused  both
   applications, because they did not meet requirements of  Appendix  FM  of
   the Immigration Rules, and although the appellant had  provided  evidence
   that at the time of her application she was unable to  fly,  she  was  no
   longer pregnant and was free to return to her country of origin, hence no
   exceptional circumstances.  The appellant and her husband (case reference
   IA/33095/2013) appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.

2) Judge Kempton dismissed the appeals by determinations promulgated  on  20
   January 2014.  (It is not clear why separate determinations were  thought
   desirable, and it would have been more convenient for these to have  been
   combined in one document.)  The judge plainly had some sympathy with  the
   appellant, who aimed to continue to degree level  study,  expressing  the
   hope that the respondent would look favourably on a further  application,
   "given the unfortunate circumstances."

3) The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  saying
   in her grounds that due to pregnancy she had been unable to continue  her
   studies; that the respondent took nearly 15 months to make the  decision;
   and that discretion should have been exercised in her favour, so that she
   would not require to return to Nepal to obtain further entry clearance.

4) On 17 February 2014  Designated  Judge  Campbell  granted  permission  to
   appeal, on the view that although the grounds were poorly drafted, it was
   arguable that the judge  erred  in  law  by  failing  to  deal  with  the
   lawfulness of the removal decisions.

5) In a Rule 24 response dated 26  February  2014  the  respondent  observes
   that any failure of the judge to consider the lawfulness of  the  removal
   decisions was immaterial.

6) By letter dated 10  April  2014  the  appellants'  legal  representatives
   advised the Upper Tribunal that they were no longer instructed.

7) By letter dated 22 April 2014 the appellant's husband asked  to  withdraw
   his  appeal.   The  Upper  Tribunal  consented,  and  notice  was  issued
   accordingly on that date.

8) There was no appearance by or on behalf of  the  appellant  on  23  April
   2014.  The hearing proceeded under Rule  38  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
   (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

9) As Mr Mullen submitted, there  is  nothing  unlawful  about  the  removal
   decisions.   The  determination  concerns  itself  with  some  irrelevant
   issues, but there is no apparent error of law in the outcome.  There  was
   no basis in evidence or in legal argument for any other result.

10)  The  appellant's  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed.  The
   determination of the First-tier Tribunal, dismissing  her  appeal,  shall
   stand.
