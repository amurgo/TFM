                             NOTICE OF DECISION


 1. Both subparagraphs of rule  40(3)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) apply to this decision.
 2. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Hone)  sent  out  on  4
    March 2020 is erroneous in law.  It cannot stand and I set it aside.
 3. The appeal is remitted to be determined by the First-tier  Tribunal  de
    novo at an oral hearing before a judge other than Judge Hone.

                               Signed
