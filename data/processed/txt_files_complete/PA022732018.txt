                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant made a claim for protection on 11 October 2017. His wife
      and their 3 children are included as his dependents. He indicated they
      are Kurdish Iraqi nationals from Sulaymaniyah. He said his wife and
      children left 1st and then he followed, meeting up in Germany in
      September 2017.

   2. His claim was that his cousin had been murdered by a man who owed him
      money. The appellant's father was approached on behalf of this man and
      asked to mediate so that he could be released. When his father refused
      the family were threatened. It is claimed matters have now developed
      into a blood feud with a political dimension because of the parties
      backgrounds.

   3. The respondent did not accept the claim was true.

   4. The appeal was heard at Glasgow on 23 May 2018 before First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Clough. In a decision promulgated on 21 September 2018
      the appeal was dismissed. The appellant attended and gave evidence.
      The appellant's wife also attended and adopted her statement, setting
      out events in their home country.

   5. At paragraph 31 of the decision the judge sets out the findings made.
      The judge recites concerns about a death certificate submitted in
      support of the claim. The judge includes that this could not be relied
      upon. The judge then went on to state she did not find the claim
      credible. After this there is reference to his failure to claim in
      safe countries. Reference is also made to an expert report about the
      security situation in his home area and the existence of blood feuds.
      However, this is not seen as material as the underlying claim is not
      believed.

   6. Significantly, the judge does not make any findings in respect of the
      evidence of the appellant's wife.

   The Upper Tribunal

   7. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis the judge failed to make
      such findings and take into account the evidence of the appellant's
      wife in support of his claim. This in turn was relevant to the
      credibility assessment.

   8. At hearing, Mr Winters accepted there was merit in the application,
      particularly in relation to the assessment of the evidence from the
      appellant's wife.

   9. I am in agreement with the concession by Mr Winters. Whilst the judge
      recited details of the evidence of the appellant's wife there is no
      reference to it under the finding section. Given the claim was said to
      engage a wider family this was a significant omission.

  10. As the error relates to the assessment of credibility which requires
      consideration of all of the evidence in the round it is necessary for
      the matter to be re-heard in the First-tier Tribunal. The necessary
      fact-finding exercise can be carried out there in a de novo hearing.

 Decision.

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Clough materially errs in law and
is set aside. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a de
novo hearing.


Signed   Date: 10 May 2019

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly.
