                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE GLEESON


                                   Between

                             SAMUEL KOFI ASABRE
                       (anonymity direction not made)
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                       DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                        PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF
             THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 13 December 2015, to refuse him  admission  to  the  United  Kingdom
    pursuant to Regulation 20(2)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006 on the basis that his residence  card  had  been
    revoked on 3 July 2014 because his alleged marriage  was  bigamous  and
    did not entitle him under the Regulations to be treated as  the  spouse
    of his claimed partner, and to remove him to Ghana under Regulation  23
    of the 2006 Regulations.

 2. On 27 March 2017, applying Sala v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2016] UKUT 00411, the First-tier Tribunal found that  there
    was no valid appeal.  In  Khan  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the Court of Appeal  found  that  Sala
    had been wrongly decided.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted on 27 November 2017 on  the  basis  of
    the Sala error.  The respondent was  invited  to  write  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal confirming  whether  he  agreed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision being set aside and the appeal remitted for rehearing  afresh.



 4. By a Rule 24 Reply dated 31 January  2019,  the  respondent  indicated,
    significantly out of time, that he does not oppose the application  for
    permission to appeal and invited the Upper Tribunal  to  determine  the
    appeal by setting aside the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    remitting the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for hearing afresh.   I
    extend time for the Rule 24 Reply and admit it,  in  the  interests  of
    justice.

 5. Pursuant to rule 40(3) of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
    2008 (as amended), the  Upper  Tribunal  is  not  required  to  provide
    written reasons for its decision under paragraph 40(2)(a) of the Rules,
    where the decision is made  with  the  consent  of  the  parties  (rule
    40(3)(a)).

 6. I am satisfied that the requirements of sub-paragraphs 40(3)(a) are met
    and that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal can  properly  be  set
    aside without a reasoned decision notice.

Decision

 7. I therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, with  no
    findings of fact or credibility preserved.  The decision in this appeal
    will be remade in the First-tier Tribunal on a date to be fixed.
