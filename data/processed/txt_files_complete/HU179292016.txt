Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C. Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S. Saifolahi, Counsel instructed by Sterling &
Law Associates


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. For the sake of consistency, I shall refer to Mr Uturashvili as the
         appellant as he was in the First-tier Tribunal.

      2. Ms Saifolahi conceded in her skeleton argument and before  me  that
         the First-tier Tribunal Judge had made an error in law in  deciding
         that the period between 1 February 2011 and 10 March 2011 (a period
         of 36 days) 'fell squarely' within the 28-day period the  Secretary
         of  State  disregards  when  considering  whether  there  has  been
         continuous leave.

      3. In deciding that the appellant's claim succeeded under  the  Rules,
         the judge approached the remaining issues  on  a  flawed  approach,
         rendering his subsequent reasoning in need of re-making.

      4. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and remit
         the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for re-making afresh.


                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 DEPUTY UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE
                                                            20 December 2018
