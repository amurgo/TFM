Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mrs H Gore, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of  Pakistan,  born  on  6  July  2002,  22
    August 2005 and 29 December 2003 respectively.  They are  siblings  who
    claim to be the  children  of  their  sponsor/mother  who  was  granted
    humanitarian protection in the UK and has indefinite leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom as a refugee.  They appealed against  the  decisions
    of the respondent refusing to grant entry clearance  under  the  family
    reunion provisions, pursuant  to  paragraph  352D  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

2.   Their appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Chana)  ("FtT")
    and dismissed in a decision and reasons promulgated on  26  June  2017.
    The central issue before the FtT was whether or not the appellants were
    related to their mother,  the  sponsor.   There  was  some  documentary
    evidence such as photocopies of  birth  certificates  and  photographs.
    The FtT considered the evidence including the sponsor's  oral  evidence
    but found that they were not related as claimed.

3.   The FtT placed considerable weight on the sponsor's failure  to  obtain
    a DNA report and was criticised her decision concluding that it was not
    reasonable to have failed to obtain such a report because of the  costs
    involved.

Grounds of Appeal

4.   The appellants argued that the  FtT  erred  by  failing  to  take  into
    account further evidence that was material to the family relationships,
    namely the First-tier Tribunal decision allowing the  sponsor's  asylum
    claim and the record of her screening interview.  It  was  argued  that
    the FtT had agreed that these documents could  be  produced  after  the
    hearing and directed that they were to be served within ten days.

5.   The FtT decision and reasons was dated 20 June 2016 and the time  limit
    for  producing  the  further  documentation  was  22  June  2016.   The
    appellants had produced and served the documents by that date.  It  was
    clear from the decision that the FtT not only referred failed to  refer
    to the direction allowing for further evidence to be produced but  also
    did not take it into account in determining the appeal.

Permission to Appeal

6.   Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  P  J  M
    Hollingworth on 24 January 2018.

7.    At the hearing before me the representatives made submissions which  I
    have taken into account  and  which  are  set  out  in  the  Record  of
    Proceedings.

Decision

8.   It is clear to me having consulted the original Record  of  Proceedings
    for the hearing before the FtT, that the FtT made a direction  allowing
    for the further material to be produced within  a  time  limit  of  ten
    days.  The FtT erred by determining the decision and reasons  prior  to
    the expiry of that time limit and thus failing to take into account the
    further  material  that  was  produced.   I  am  satisfied   that   the
    appellants' solicitors served the relevant  documentation  by  22  June
    2016 and which was evidence that ought to have been considered  by  the
    FtT in reaching its decision.

9.   It was particularly significant given that the  material  included  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision allowing the sponsor's asylum claim and in
    which she was found not only to be a  vulnerable  person  but  entirely
    credible as to her claim and as to the circumstances of having left her
    family.  Furthermore there was reference  made  in  that  decision  and
    reasons to her family members consisting of her three daughters born in
    2002, 2004, 2006 and to them living with  her  estranged  husband.   In
    addition, the screening interview at paragraph 6.4 names the appellants
    and also made reference to the fact of the  sponsor  having  last  seen
    them in March 2011.

10.  I take the view that the FtT ought to  have  taken  into  account  this
    further evidence which was material and that the failure to do  so  was
    unfair, and having regard to Devaseelan where it was held that a  first
    decision is the starting point for any further determination.

Error of law decision

11.  I have decided that there was an error  of  law  in  the  decision  and
    reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana.  I set aside  the  decision
    made.

Re making the decision

12.   I then heard submissions having decided that the decision could be re-
    made before me in the Upper Tribunal.   To  that  end,  the  appellants
    produced a further bundle dated  23  August  2018  which  included  the
    further evidence, namely the First-tier Tribunal determination dated 20
    November 2013 and the sponsor's screening interview dated 8 April 2013.
     In addition, the  appellants  had  provided  three  DNA  test  reports
    confirming that the sponsor was the parent of each of the appellants.

13.  Mr Avery raised some concerns as to the lack of background  information
    that would normally be produced within the body the DNA reports.

14.  I considered all of the evidence before me and  having  regard  to  the
    standard of proof as the balance of probabilities, concluded  that  the
    appellants have made out their case.  The bulk of  the  evidence  which
    now includes the DNA reports establishes that the children are  related
    to the sponsor as claimed and that they  were  members  of  her  family
    prior to her fleeing from Pakistan.  The requirements  under  Paragraph
    352D are met.

15.   I re-make the decision to allow the appeals on human  rights  grounds.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the  appellants  are
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify them or any member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellants and to the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
