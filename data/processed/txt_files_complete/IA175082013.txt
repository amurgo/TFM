                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The parties are as described above, but are referred to in the  rest
       of this determination as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. The SSHD appeals, on grounds of failure to  give  adequate  reasons,
       against  a  determination  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   Clough,
       allowing  the  appellant's  appeal  against  refusal  of  his   long
       residence application.  The determination gives these reasons:

           8. I find the appellant's evidence and the evidence produced  on
           his behalf credible because of the  detail  in  the  documentary
           evidence and because I found the appellant a credible witness.


           9. I accept the appellant arrived in the UK in January 1994.

    3. The finding at ï¿½9 was on the crucial issue.  (A  shorter  period  of
       proved residence might have been enough, but that  does  not  matter
       for present purposes.)  Mr Young said that there was no  explanation
       of why the appellant and the person using the false  identity  under
       which he claimed to have lived for many years are found  to  be  one
       and the same.


    4. Mr Devlin has cited most of the case law on sufficiency  of  reasons
       in his list of authorities.  There is also Khan [1983]  QB  790,  on
       which the SSHD's grounds rely.  Representatives were not at odds  on
       the relevant principles, but on whether this  determination  is,  in
       light of those principles, adequate.

    5. Mr Devlin's argument (summarised, and omitting citations)  was  that
       reasons need to be adequate for the informed reader;  the  SSHD  had
       the appellant's detailed skeleton argument in the FtT, which clearly
       sets out his case by reference to  his  documentary  evidence,  also
       before the SSHD;  a judgment should not be upset unless a party with
       knowledge of the evidence and submissions is  unable  to  understand
       why the decision is  adverse;  where  there  is  no  competing  oral
       evidence, and no discrepancies to resolve, little more need be  said
       than that a witness is found reliable; it  was  not  ideal  for  the
       determination to leave the reader to cross-refer to other sources to
       find its sense, or simply to adopt one side's position, and  it  was
       at  "the  outer  edge"  for  adequacy  of  reasoning,   but  it  was
       sufficient.

    6. I preferred the submission  for  the  appellant.   It  is  not  good
       practice to adopt the case of  one  side  wholesale,  or  simply  by
       reference.  It is a virtue to be succinct,  but  there  should  have
       been a few sentences explaining the  coherence  of  the  appellant's
       well-presented evidence, oral and  documentary.   However,  even  by
       reference  to   the   respondent's   selected   case,   Khan,   this
       determination contains the necessary minimum: consideration  of  the
       point at issue, and an indication  of  the  evidence  on  which  the
       conclusion is based.  There is a degree of disingenuousness  in  the
       grounds.  The respondent  knows  the  appellant's  case,  and  could
       properly say why it might not have been capable of  success.   There
       was a large body of evidence to show that the appellant has been  in
       the UK in his assumed identity since 1994.  The respondent does  not
       say that there were any deadly points made in the original  decision
       or in submissions at the hearing with  which  the  judge  failed  to
       deal.  The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
