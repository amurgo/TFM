Representation:

For the Appellant: Miss A Hashmi, Ashwood Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr C Dewison, Senior Home Office Presenting Office


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan who was born on  the  21  April
      1986, and who arrived in the United Kingdom on the 12 September  2010,
      with entry clearance conferring leave to  enter  valid  until  the  30
      November 2012, as a Tier 4 student.  On the 11 January  2012,  he  was
      granted leave to remain until the 11 January 2014, as a  Tier  1  Post
      Study Migrant.  On the 10 January 2014, he applied for leave to remain
      in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur,  but  his  application
      was refused by the Respondent on the 27 February 2014.   At  the  same
      time the Secretary of State made the decision to remove the  Appellant
      from the United Kingdom by way of directions under Section 47  of  the
      Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 as amended.

   2. The Appellant, dissatisfied with that decision, appealed to the First-
      tier Tribunal and his appeal was heard at North Shields on the 14  May
      2014, by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fisher.  The judge noted  that  the
      Appellant had claimed 75 points under Appendix A  for  Attributes  and
      had produced two bank statements, one from  BankIslami  and  one  from
      Lloyds PLC in support of his application.  No points were  awarded  to
      him under Appendix A, because the  Respondent  asserted  that  on  the
      evidence provided there was no one day in common between the two  bank
      statements when the balances in aggregate  amounted  to  the  required
      �50,000.

   3. The judge noted that in a bundle provided for the hearing there was  a
      further BankIslami bank statement for some point at the  beginning  of
      December 2013 (the date is not clear on the copy) expiring  on  the  1
      January 2014, that showed that the balance in that account as  at  the
      31 December 2013 exceeded the balance in the account that  was  before
      the Respondent, and that, taken with the �10,000 balance which was  in
      the Lloyds PLC bank account as  at  the  31  December  2013,  met  the
      requirements of the rules.  As the judge pointed out, he is  not  able
      to take account of the BankIslami statement in the bundle, because the
      statement was not submitted with the application.  The judge concluded
      that the Appellant had failed to submit evidence with his  application
      which showed that there was a single point in time when the  aggregate
      balance in the two bank accounts amounted to the required �50,000.  He
      repeated the assertion that it was not possible for  him  to  consider
      page 14 of the bundle since this  was  post-application  evidence  and
      none of the exceptions to Section 85A were shown to apply.

   4. It was submitted on behalf of the  Appellant  at  the  appeal  hearing
      before Judge Fisher, that the Secretary of State should have exercised
      her flexibility policy in respect of evidence.   The  judge  dismissed
      that assertion and pointed out that Paragraph  245AA  did  not  apply,
      because this was not a case where a sequence  of  documents  had  been
      submitted and one or more was missing.  He pointed out that the  Court
      of Appeal in Rodriguez (Flexibility Policy) [2013]  UKUT  00042  (IAC)
      held that there was no requirement on the Respondent in every case  to
      make enquiries or to enquire whether further funds are available.

   5. The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal are lengthy,  but  contain
      only one challenge and assert that the judge ignored the principle  of
      evidential flexibility.  At paragraph 5 of  the  grounds  there  is  a
      claim that the precise procedure to be followed by caseworkers is very
      detailed and it applies where:

            "1.   There is missing evidence,

            2.    The application would not fail to be refused even  if  the
                 missing evidence were to be provided,

            3.    It is established that the evidence  exists  or  there  is
                 sufficient reason to believe that the evidence exists,

            4.    The caseworker must contact the  applicant/rep/sponsor  by
                 telephone for the evidence.  No more than two  attempts  to
                 contact by telephone.  If there  is  a  rep  they  must  be
                 contacted.  Email contact should follow the telephone call.
                  If the telephone call cannot be made a  letter  should  be
                 sent,

            5.    A time frame of seven days is given for  the  response  to
                 the request in cases to be left open for seven days."

   6. I  asked  Ms  Hashmi  if  she  could  tell  me  where  those  specific
      instructions come from.  She agreed that  they  did  not  reflect  the
      Secretary of State for the Home  Department's  Evidential  Flexibility
      Policy.  Addressing me on the grounds, she told me that the judge  had
      failed to take account of the Evidential Flexibility  Policy,  because
      the Appellant did  send  evidence  to  show  that  there  was  �50,000
      available in two separate  accounts.   She  agreed  that  one  account
      period had expired before  the  other  account  period  started.   She
      referred me to page 14 of her bundle, but accepted that this was post-
      decision evidence and could not be taken into account.

   7. For the Respondent, Mr Dewison submitted that there was  no  merit  in
      the ground and that the judge had properly considered all the evidence
      and looked at the requirements of the  rules.   His  analysis  of  the
      evidence shows no error and this was not a situation  covered  by  the
      Evidential Flexibility Policy.  The judge demonstrates at paragraph 14
      that he considered this and also Paragraph 245AA,  he  submitted  that
      there was no error and that the appeal should be upheld.

   8. I have concluded that the determination of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Fisher does not contain any error on a point of  law.   The  Appellant
      was required to show that on a common date there was available the sum
      of at least �50,000 in his bank or  bank  accounts.   What  transpired
      here is that two statements were submitted covering different  periods
      so that it was not possible to know how much money the  Appellant  had
      in aggregate on the dates in the gap between the two bank  statements.
      The Appellant simply failed to satisfy the requirements  of  the  rule
      and for that reason I uphold the determination of Judge  Fisher  which
      shall stand.
