                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, Magalie Bamu, date of birth 21st  February  1983,  is  a
    citizen of France.   This  an  appeal  by  the  Appellant  against  the
    decision of Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Woodcraft  promulgated
    on 23rd February 2015  whereby  the  judge  dismissed  the  Appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Respondent  to  make  a  deportation
    order against the Appellant under  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2006.

 2. This case was listed on a previous occasion and was directed  to  await
    the outcome of the decision of the Court of  Justice  of  the  European
    Union in the case of E v Subdelegaci�n del Gobierno  en  �lava  as  the
    case raised the same point with regard to  the  interpretation  of  the
    treaty, directives and regulations.  By a decision issued  on  13  July
    2017 the CJEU had issued a decision on the points raised in the Grounds
    of Appeal.

 3. Firstly, we deal with  the  circumstances  of  making  the  deportation
    order.  The Appellant and her partner Eric  Bikubi  were  convicted  of
    murder of the 15 year old brother of the Appellant and of two counts of
    assault occasioning actual bodily harm against the Appellant's sisters,
    one aged 20 at the time of the assault, and the other a child  aged  11
    at the time of the assault.  It appears all the three victims had  been
    staying as guests with the Appellant and her partner over the Christmas
    period.  The Appellant and her partner concluded that the three victims
    were witches and determined to exorcise the  victims.   They  subjected
    the victims to sustained beatings extended over a period of  two  days,
    forcing the victims to confess that they  were  witches.   The  victims
    were beaten with various  objects.   The  victims  confessed  to  being
    witches in the hope that the beatings would stop but to no avail.   The
    Appellant joined in the assault both verbally  and  by  encouraging  Mr
    Bikubi to carry out the attacks.  There is in the decision  an  extract
    from the judge's sentencing remarks describing the  injuries  that  the
    Appellant's brother had suffered.  It is evident that it is  merely  an
    extract and does not recount  the  full  extent  of  the  beatings  and
    injuries.  The extract reads as follows:

         "The beatings inflicted on Kristy grew worse.   His  ear  was  torn
         with a pair of pliers.  ... Two of Kristy's teeth  were  broken  by
         Bikubi using a hammer and forcing the iron weightlifting  bar  into
         his mouth.  There is some evidence that [the Appellant] forced that
         iron bar into his  mouth.   One  broken  tooth  was  found  on  the
         bathroom floor the other was found in the throat of the victim, the
         post mortem found a metal screw in the intestines.  ... On your own
         admission Magalie Bamu you used a  curtain  pole  as  a  weapon  to
         strike Kristy and it was used with enough  whether  by  you  or  by
         Bikubi to cause it to be bent.  Several telephone calls  were  made
         by both of you to your parents Magalie Bamu  in  Paris.   You  told
         them that Kristy, Kelly and P were witches and had  confessed  that
         they were.  Your astonished parents asked to speak to the  children
         who in fear agreed that they were  witches  and  tried  by  talking
         nonsense to convey all was not  well.   On  Christmas  morning  the
         final assaults took place.  Bikubi smashed a  sack  full  of  heavy
         marbles on Kristy's head using both hands to do  so.   The  assault
         must have taken some time and was severe enough to  cause  swelling
         and injury to Kristy's brain.  Kristy was taken into  the  bathroom
         and made to get into the bath.  At some point in his weakened state
         Kristy sank beneath the water and drowned.  When the Appellant  did
         call the ambulance she said that Kristy had drowned himself.   When
         the police and ambulance arrived Bikubi told a pack of  lies.   The
         Appellant heard those lies and  did  not  attempt  in  any  way  to
         contradict them.  Her brother and sisters who did not speak English
         were unable to  explain  until  a  French  speaking  paramedic  and
         interpreter were found."

 4. The judge was in no doubt that the murder involved a  sadistic  element
    and  that  the  Appellant  and  her  co-defendant  had  brutalised  and
    physically abused Kristy until eventually he died  after  a  course  of
    prolonged torture over a  period  of  two  days.   There  were  certain
    aggravating features within the incident as well.  Two of  the  victims
    were of vulnerable ages and there was an abuse of a position of  trust.



 5. Designated Judge  Woodcraft  dismissed  the  Appellant's  appeal  being
    satisfied that the Appellant constituted a genuine and  present  threat
    to the fundamental interests of the society and was  satisfied  on  all
    the evidence that the decision was proportionate in terms  of  the  EEA
    Treaty and Regulations and also that it did not breach any rights under
    the European Convention on  Human  Rights  specifically  Article  3  or
    Article 8.

 6. The first point taken with the Grounds of Appeal is whether or not  the
    Appellant constituted a present threat as required by the provisions of
    the EU Directives and the Immigration Regulations 2006.   The  relevant
    provision of the Directives is the second subparagraph of Article 27 of
    Directive 2004/38/EC.  The relevant Article of the Directive provides:

        "27(1)     Subject to the provisions of this Chapter, Member States
               may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of  Union
               citizens  and  their   family   members,   irrespective   of
               nationality, on grounds of public policy, public security or
               public health. These grounds shall not be invoked  to  serve
               economic ends.

           (2)    Measures taken on grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
               security shall comply with the principle of  proportionality
               and shall be based exclusively on the  personal  conduct  of
               the  individual  concerned.  Previous  criminal  convictions
               shall not in themselves constitute grounds for  taking  such
               measures.

         The personal conduct of the individual concerned must  represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
         the fundamental interests  of  society.   Justifications  that  are
         isolated  from  the  particulars  of  the  case  or  that  rely  on
         considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted."

    In passing we would note that Article 33(1) and (2) of  the  Directives
    also provides:

         "33(1)   Expulsion orders may not be  issued  by  the  host  Member
                State as a penalty  or  legal  consequence  of  a  custodial
                penalty, unless they conform to the requirements of Articles
                27, 28 and 29.

           (2)    If an expulsion order, as provided for in paragraph 1, is
               enforced more than two years after it was issued, the Member
               State shall check that the individual concerned is currently
               and genuinely a threat to public policy or  public  security
               and shall assess whether there has been any material  change
               in the circumstances since the expulsion order was issued."

    The provisions within the Directive are reflected  in  the  Regulations
    themselves, which is Regulation 21, sets out factors which have  to  be
    taken  into  account  in  assessing   public   policy   considerations.
    Regulation 21 provides:

         "21. (1) In this regulation a  "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
                  decision taken on the grounds of  public  policy,  public
                  security or public health.

              (2) A relevant decision may not be  taken  to  serve  economic
                   ends.

              (3) A relevant decision may not  be  taken  in  respect  of  a
                  person  with  a  permanent  right  of   residence   under
                  regulation 15 except on serious grounds of public  policy
                  or public security.

             (4)   A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
                  grounds of public security in respect of an EEA  national
                  who-

                  (a) has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                       period of at least ten years prior  to  the  relevant
                       decision; or

                  (b) is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                       is necessary in his best interests, as  provided  for
                       in the Convention on the Rights of the Child  adopted
                       by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20th
                       November 1989(11).

             (5)   Where a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public
                  policy or  public  security  it  shall,  in  addition  to
                  complying  with  the   preceding   paragraphs   of   this
                  regulation, be taken in  accordance  with  the  following
                  principles-

                  (a) the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                       proportionality;

                  (b)  the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                       personal conduct of the person concerned;

                  (c)t     the personal conduct  of  the  person  concerned
                       must represent a genuine,  present  and  sufficiently
                       serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
                       interests of society;

                  (d) matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                       which relate to considerations of general  prevention
                       do not justify the decision;

                  (e) a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                       themselves justify the decision.

             (6)   Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
                  public policy or public security in relation to a  person
                  who is resident in the United Kingdom the decision  maker
                  must take account of  considerations  such  as  the  age,
                  state of health, family and  economic  situation  of  the
                  person, the person's length of residence  in  the  United
                  Kingdom, the person's  social  and  cultural  integration
                  into the United Kingdom and the extent  of  the  person's
                  links with his country of origin."

 7. The point under consideration in the present appeal is whether  or  not
    the Appellant being in custody she constituted a present  threat  to  a
    fundamental interest of the United Kingdom.  As identified in the  case
    of E in the Court of Justice the point is being  considered.   In  that
    case E had been convicted after a series of trials of abusing  children
    and had been sentenced  to  six  years'  imprisonment.   While  he  was
    considered to be a genuine  threat  to  the  fundamental  interests  of
    society given the nature of the convictions the issue was  whether  has
    was  a  present  threat  given  that  he  was  serving  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment.  At paragraph 12  of  the  decision  the  question  under
    consideration was framed  in  terms  that  it  was  doubted  whether  E
    represents a genuine and present threat to the extent  that  he  is  in
    prison and still has a long sentence to serve.  In the judgment however
    at paragraphs 23 and 24 it is made plain that the issue was that  there
    must be in existence in the individual concerned a propensity to act in
    the same way in the future.  The fact that the person was imprisoned at
    the time of the expulsion  decision  being  made  without  that  person
    having the prospect of being released for several years  could  not  be
    regarded as relating to the personal conduct of the  person  concerned.
    Ultimately in paragraph 27 it was determined that the provision must be
    interpreted as meaning that the fact that a person is in prison at  the
    time of the expulsion decision being adopted  are  made  including  the
    prospect of the person not being released in the near  future  did  not
    exclude that his conduct represented a present and genuine threat to  a
    fundamental interest in the society.  That seems to determine the first
    point raised within the Grounds of Appeal.

 8. Accordingly for the reasons set out we are  satisfied  that  the  judge
    properly approached the issue  as  to  whether  or  not  the  Appellant
    constituted a genuine, present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  and
    there is no material error of law in the way that the judge  approached
    that issue.

 9. The second point taken in the Grounds of Appeal is that the  judge  has
    wrongly rejected the conclusion of the NOMS Report in  the  absence  of
    contrary evidence.  The judge had  at  paragraph  44  of  the  decision
    specifically considered the  NOMS  Report  and  pointed  out  that  the
    document was in some  sense  curious  and  contradictory.   The  report
    concluded that there was a low risk of reoffending.  The  judge  within
    the conclusions has pointed out that the offence of which the Appellant
    had been  convicted  was  a  specifically  horrific  offence  involving
    torture and beatings over a period of two days.  The judge pointed  out
    that two of the victims were children  and  all  of  the  victims  were
    related to the Appellant.  Yet rather than provide protection according
    to the verdict of the jury the Appellant had willingly participated  in
    mistreating the victims in the most severe manner.  The judge had noted
    also that the Appellant's belief that the family members were possessed
    of witchcraft had not been accepted.  It was a delusion that could  not
    be sustained.  Having regard to the remarks of the Criminal  Judge  the
    Designated Judge  found  that  this  was  a  dangerous  and  irrational
    delusion on the part of the Appellant.  That coupled with the fact that
    the Appellant had continued to deny her guilt was a  serious  cause  of
    concern as far as the Designated Judge was concerned with dealing  with
    the Appellant.  With regard to working with the Appellant to reduce the
    risk of reoccurrence until such time as the Appellant accepted what she
    had done and faced the truth of it any concept  of  rehabilitation  was
    difficult and it was difficult for meaningful  rehabilitation  work  to
    begin.  The judge noted at no stage had  the  Appellant  expressed  any
    remorse or genuine  remorse  for  what  she  had  done.   Nor  had  the
    Appellant displayed any insight into the effect of her behaviour on the
    two victims.  It was in the light of those factors that the judge  made
    the assessment with regard to the NOMS Report and whether  or  not  the
    Appellant continued to present a danger.

10. The fact that little rehabilitative  work  has  been  carried  out  was
    understandable in the  circumstance  but  the  judge  was  entitled  to
    conclude that there will be no  interference  with  any  rehabilitation
    work of the Appellant.  In  those  circumstances  also  the  judge  was
    entitled to approach the recommendations and  the  conclusions  of  the
    NOMS Report in  a  critical  manner.   Given  the  very  fact  that  no
    rehabilitation work had commenced, there had been no acknowledgement of
    the seriousness of the offence and no attempt at  remorse.   The  judge
    has given ample reasons why there are factors in the  case  which  lead
    one to conclude that despite the conclusions within the NOMS Report the
    Appellant represented a clear and present danger and continue to do  so
    to a fundamental interest of society.  There was sufficient  evidential
    basis therefore for the judge to make the findings  that  he  did.   In
    that event we find that there is no material error of law  in  the  way
    that the judge treated  the  NOMS  Report.   The  appeal  is  therefore
    dismissed.
