For the Respondent:    Mr M Muirhead, (Obaseki Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer but I  will  refer  to
    the original appellant who is a citizen of Jamaica born on  7  November
    1964 as the appellant herein.  He was refused an entry clearance  on  5
    December 2013 as the husband of Veda Margh, a British citizen  whom  he
    married on 6 April 2013.

2.   The refusal was on the basis that the Entry Clearance Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the parties' relationship was genuine or  subsisting  or
    that they intended to live together permanently in the United  Kingdom.
    In the premises the Entry Clearance Officer did  not  consider  whether
    the appellant met the financial requirements of Appendix FM.

3.   The appellant appealed and his appeal came before  a  First-tier  Judge
    on  20  February  2015.   The  judge  resolved  the  question  of   the
    relationship between the parties in their favour and concluded that the
    marriage was genuine and subsisting and that  each  party  intended  to
    live together permanently with the other.  There has been no  challenge
    to that aspect of the decision.

4.   The judge  noted  that  there  was  no  issue  over  accommodation  and
    concluded her determination as follows:

         "27. There is evidence of the sponsor's pension benefits at E20  of
             the respondent's bundle.  This equates  to  �1000  a  calendar
             month.  There is evidence that she has a tenant  and  receives
             rent however she confirms this  is  undeclared  and  her  bank
             statement does not show the amount she claims  is  paid.   The
             sponsor also receives a single person discount on her  Council
             Tax to which she is not entitled if there is another occupant.
              While accepting it likely the claim is true, the evidence  is
             not in the format required and  so  I  do  not  take  it  into
             account.  This means the appellant must show savings  to  make
             up the shortfall from the sum of �18,600 gross per  annum  set
             out in the rules.

         28.  The pension credit was �253.73 a week.  This totals �13193.96.
              The shortfall  is  therefore  �5406.04.   The  appellant  has
             produced a JNBS bank statements for  the  sponsor  that  shows
             savings at the time of the application of �44289.  This  is  a
             joint with the sponsor's son however most withdrawals  are  in
             sponsor's  name.   A  copy  bank  statement  at  E46  of   the
             respondents bundle shows a cheque withdrawal corresponds  from
             the sponsors UK account with credit in  the  JNBS  account  at
             E45.  I am satisfied that the funds are under the  control  of
             the sponsor.

         29.  I have regard to the requirements at E-CP.3.2 of the rules.

             When  determining  whether  the   financial   requirement   in
             paragraph EECP.

             3.1  is met only the following  sources  will  be  taken  into
             account -

             (a)  income of the partner from specified employment or  self-
                  employment;

             (b)  specified pension income of the applicant and partner;

             (c)  any specified maternity allowance or bereavement  benefit
                  received by the partner in the UK or any specified payment
                  relating to service in HM Forces received by the applicant
                  or partner;

             (d)  other specified income of the applicant and partner; and

             (e)  specified savings of the applicant and partner.

             E-ECP.3.3.  The requirements to be met  under  this  paragraph
             are -

             (a)  the applicant's partner must be receiving one or more  of
                  the following -

             (i)  disability  living  allowance;  (ii)  severe  disablement
                  allowance; (iii) industrial  injury  disablement  benefit;
                  (iv) attendance allowance;  (v)  carer's  allowance;  (vi)
                  personal  independence   payment;   (vii)   Armed   Forces
                  Independence Payment or Guaranteed  Income  Payment  under
                  the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme; or  (viii)  Constant
                  Attendance   Allowance,   Mobility   Supplement   or   War
                  Disablement Pension under the War Pensions Scheme.

         30.  It is not clear whether state pension credit  is  included  as
             income.  Section 21 of Appendix FM-SE  setting  out  specified
             evidence at paragraph 21 references income not counted.   This
             does not include state pension  credit.   There  is  also  the
             rent.  It is evidence there is, more  than  sufficient  income
             and savings to avoid the appellant having recourse  to  public
             funds.  Consequently I find that the appellant has  discharged
             the burden of proof as regards the financial requirements."

5.   The Entry Clearance Officer applied for  permission  to  appeal  noting
    that the sponsor relied on cash savings in order to make the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM but that these savings were held jointly by
    her son.  A point was also  taken  on  the  fact  that  the  judge  had
    referred to paragraph 281 of the Immigration Rules in the course of her
    determination.  The grounds (including  emphasis  added  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer) continue as follows:

         "Appendix FM-SE1(a)(iii) lays out the requirements in  relation  to
         Bank statements:

         1.   In  relation  to  evidencing  the  financial  requirements  in
             Appendix FM the following general provisions shall apply:

             (a)  Bank statements must:

             (i)   be  from  a  financial  institution  regulated  by   the
                  appropriate regulatory body for the country in which  that
                  institution is operating; (ii) not  be  from  a  financial
                  institution  on  the  list  of  excluded  institutions  in
                  Appendix P of these rules: (iii) in relation  to  personal
                  bank statements be only in the name of:

             (1)   the  applicant's  partner,  the  appellant  or  both  as
                  appropriate; or (2)  if  the  applicant  is  a  child  the
                  applicant's parent's partner, the  applicant's  parent  or
                  both as appropriate; or (3) if the applicant is  an  adult
                  dependent  relative,  the  applicant's  sponsor   or   the
                  applicant, unless otherwise stated.

                  3.   The sponsor's savings  of  �44,000  are  held  in  an
                      account held jointly with her son.  It  is  therefore
                      submitted that the Judge errs in finding  that  these
                      savings may be accepted, in a partner application the
                      only joint funds which may be accepted are those held
                      by an Appellant and their Sponsor, that  is  not  the
                      case here.

                  4.   Furthermore the requirement of Appendix FM-SE  11  in
                      respect of savings is not met.

         11.  In respect of cash savings the following must be provided:

             (a)  personal bank statements showing that at least the  level
                  of cash savings relied upon in the  application  has  been
                  held in an account(s) in the name of the person and  their
                  partner jointly throughout the period of 6 months prior to
                  the date of application.

                  5.   It is unclear why the Judge refers to  paragraph  281
                      of the Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended)  at  [16]
                      when the application was made on  24  September  2013
                      and therefore Appendix FM applies  and  the  relevant
                      findings on eligibility should have been made under E-
                      ECP.2.6 and E-ECP.2.7."

6.   Permission to appeal was granted by the First-tier Tribunal on  19  May
    2015 and the parties were notified of this on 28 May 2015.

7.   Ms Brocklesby-Weller lodged  copies  of  the  Rules  in  force  at  the
    relevant date.  She confirmed there was no  challenge  to  the  judge's
    findings on the relationship.  The challenge was limited to  the  issue
    of the financial requirements.  The judge had  misdirected  herself  by
    referring to paragraph 281 of the Immigration  Rules  in  paragraph  16
    where she had referred to subparagraph (v) of paragraph 281 which reads
    as follows: "the parties will be able to maintain  themselves  and  any
    dependants adequately without recourse to public funds...".   This  was
    apparent from what she had said in paragraph 30: "it is evidence  there
    is, more than sufficient income and  savings  to  avoid  the  appellant
    having recourse to public funds [sic]".

8.   The judge had identified three sources of income  -  the  pension,  the
    bank account and income from a tenant.  The latter  had  been  rejected
    for the reasons given in paragraph 27.  However the judge had  referred
    to the savings of �44,289 and had erred in  taking  them  into  account
    given that they were in joint names.  It was only permitted  under  the
    Rules that the account be in the name of the applicant or the applicant
    and his or her partner.  If a third party was named  that  party  could
    legally withdraw money and the purpose of the Rules was to limit risks.



9.   Mr Muirhead submitted  that  the  Rules  were  unclear.   Normally  the
    spouse and the sponsor would be named jointly and  he  submitted  there
    were special circumstances in this case.  The sponsor's son had made it
    clear that he had no financial interest  in  the  account  although  it
    appeared that he had made two withdrawals from  it  amounting  to  some
    �200 in 2010.  The  money  in  the  account  was  the  sponsor's  money
    resulting from a property sale.  The sponsor was an  elderly  lady  and
    her son carried out transactions on her behalf.  The sponsor was out of
    the country and it would be preferable if an adjournment  was  granted.
    I pointed out that the appellant would have been aware that  permission
    to appeal had been granted in May and there  had  been  no  attempt  to
    lodge further  evidence  or  support  the  judge's  decision  on  other
    grounds.

10.  Ms Brocklesby-Weller referred to SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ  387  where
    the court had made clear at paragraph 51 that where the Rules were  not
    complied with compelling circumstances would have to apply to justify a
    grant of leave to enter.  In paragraph 52 of the decision the court had
    stated that the evidence rules had the same general  objective  as  the
    substantive rules:

         "Namely to limit the risk that someone is admitted into the  United
         Kingdom and then becomes a burden  on  public  resources,  and  the
         Secretary of State has the same primary  function  in  relation  to
         them, to assess the risk and put in place measures which are judged
         suitable to contain it within acceptable  bounds.   Similar  weight
         should be given to her  assessment  of  what  the  public  interest
         requires in both context."

    There was no reason she submitted  for  preferential  treatment  to  be
    given to the parties in this case, referring  to  paragraph  53  of  SS
    (Congo).  The judge had furthermore taken into account rules that  were
    irrelevant which had affected her conclusions at paragraph 30.

11.  Mr Muirhead submitted that the judge  had  found  that  the  money  was
    under the control of the sponsor in paragraph 28 of the decision.

12.  At the conclusion of the hearing I  reserved  my  decision.   I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was flawed  in
    law.

13.  There is a single issue in this case which  relates  to  the  financial
    requirements and in particular the fact that the sponsor's account  was
    not in her sole name or in the name of her  and  her  partner  jointly.
    The account was in the joint name of the partner and her son.

14.  There appears to be no ambiguity in the Rules whatsoever.   In  respect
    of adults the monies must be held and be held only in the name of  "the
    applicant's partner, the applicant or both as appropriate...".

15.  It is clear that the son has full authority to  draw  on  the  account.
    He has done so in the past although only for small amounts.   The  fact
    is he has authority to sign cheques on the account and  the  rules  are
    quite clear about this.  In the circumstances of this case the  account
    has to be in the sponsor's sole name or in the name of the sponsor  and
    her husband.  It is not at all clear on the evidence why steps were not
    taken to put the savings into her sole name.  As  I  have  pointed  out
    there was no updating statement from the sponsor and no attempt to file
    a respondent's notice despite many  months  having  passed.   It  would
    appear that very simple steps need to be taken to make the  application
    rule compliant and such steps have not been taken.

16.  I am conscious that  the  First-tier  Judge  was  labouring  under  the
    difficulty that the Entry Clearance Officer  had  not  dealt  with  the
    financial issues  but  nevertheless  the  determination  is  materially
    flawed in law and I have no alternative but to dismiss this  appeal  on
    the evidence.  It may be that the parties can put their finances  on  a
    proper footing and that a further application to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer will meet with more success  in  the  light  of  the  otherwise
    favourable findings made by the First-tier  Judge.   However,  for  the
    reasons given by Ms  Brocklesby-Weller  and  as  mentioned  above  this
    appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer is  allowed  and  I  reverse  the
    decision of the First-tier Judge allowing the appeal.

Notice of Decision

17.  The appeal is dismissed.

18.  There was no anonymity direction in this case and I make none.  In  the
    particular circumstances of this case I do not interfere with  the  fee
    award made by the judge.
