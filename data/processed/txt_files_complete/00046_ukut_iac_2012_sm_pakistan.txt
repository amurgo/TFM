For the Respondent:      In person


So long as account is taken of the following basic principles, there  is  at
present no need for further citation of authority  on  the  public  interest
side of the balancing exercise. (See paragraph 11  for  version  with  foot-
notes referring to authorities; but such references will  not  be  necessary
for judges deciding individual cases).

     The following basic principles can be derived from the present case law
  concerning the issue of the public interest in relation to the deportation
                                                       of foreign criminals:

 a) In a case of automatic deportation, full account must be taken  of  the
    strong public interest  in  removing  foreign  citizens   convicted  of
    serious offences, which lies not only  in  the  prevention  of  further
    offences on the part of the  individual  concerned,  but  in  deterring
    others from committing them in the first place.

 b) Deportation of foreign criminals expresses  society's  condemnation  of
    serious  criminal  activity  and  promotes  public  confidence  in  the
    treatment of foreign citizens who have committed them.

 c) The starting-point for assessing the facts of the offence of  which  an
    individual has been convicted, and their effect on others, and  on  the
    public as a whole, must be the view taken by the sentencing judge.

 d) The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of the  situation  at  the
    date of the hearing.

 e) Full account should also be taken of any  developments  since  sentence
    was passed, for example the result of any disciplinary adjudications in
    prison or detention, or any OASys or licence report.

 f) In considering the relevant facts on 'private and  family  life'  under
    article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, "for a  settled  migrant  who
    has lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and
    youth in [this] country, very serious reasons are required  to  justify
    expulsion".

 g) Such serious reasons are needed "all  the  more  so  where  the  person
    concerned committed the relevant offences as a juvenile"  ;  but  "very
    serious violent offences  can  justify  expulsion  even  if  they  were
    committed by a minor". Other very serious offending may also have  this
    consequence.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal, by the Secretary of State who was the respondent  to
    the original appeal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge TJ Cary and a lay member), sitting at Taylor House  on  24  June
    2010, to allow a deportation appeal by a citizen of Pakistan, following
    his conviction for serious criminal offences. Permission was  given  on
    all three grounds of appeal: in short, on the basis that  it  could  be
    argued that:


               i) the panel had not paid enough attention to the assessment
                  of risk of re offending in the pre-sentence report [PSR];


              ii) they had made an obvious mistake of fact when  they  said
                  the appellant had not been convicted of  any  offence  of
                  dishonesty such as  theft  or  fraud  (when  one  of  the
                  offences for which he had last been  sentenced  had  been
                  burglary); and
             iii)  they  had  given  no  reasons  for  finding   that   the
                  appellant's  most  recent  convictions   had   not   "...
                  represented   an   irreversible   downward   spiral    of
                  offending".


 2. The appellant was born on 5 February 1988, so is now nearly 24, and had
    come to this country with his family as visitors on 30 May  1998,  when
    he was only 10; but they claimed asylum as  members  of  the  Christian
    minority in Pakistan shortly afterwards,. The Home  Office  reached  no
    decision at all on that claim, till on 6 January  2004  they  were  all
    given indefinite leave  to  remain,  apparently  under  the  concession
    relating to families in that position.

 3. It was not long after that decision, when the appellant  was  only  16,
    that he began his criminal career. The Home Office appeal  bundle  does
    not contain, as should  be  standard  practice,  a  full  list  of  the
    appellant's antecedents; so we shall adopt the summary of  them  by  HH
    Judge Devaux, who at Ipswich Crown Court on 2 July 2009  sentenced  him
    to a total of 50 months' imprisonment, 32 for possession of  class  'A'
    drugs with intent to supply, and 18 for burglary and aggravated vehicle-
    taking, all committed with others. The judge noted 18 offences  on  the
    appellant's  record,  none  resulting  in  a  custodial  sentence,  but
    including a robbery when he was 16, and five convictions for possession
    of drugs; no previous conviction for burglary, but one  for  aggravated
    vehicle-taking: the appellant had never had a job.

 4. On the offences for which  he  was  dealing  with  the  appellant,  the
    sentencing judge noted that he had pled  guilty  to  sample  counts  of
    supplying class 'A' drugs to one named individual; but that person  had
    been using them at the rate of �50 - 60 worth a day,  and  most  likely
    resorting to crime to get the money. The judge said the  appellant  did
    not plead guilty to the burglary, though he had admitted the aggravated
    vehicle-taking. We have a certificate from Basildon Crown  Court,  from
    where this indictment had been  transferred  for  sentence,  suggesting
    that he had been dealt with "on his  own  confession";  but  that  must
    relate only to the aggravated vehicle-taking.

 5. This is what the judge said about the Basildon indictment:


       The  [burglary]  offence  was  committed  with  accomplices.  It  was
       planned. The occupants were present in the  building  and  very  much
       disturbed by you. ... [The aggravated  vehicle-taking  to  which  the
       burglary had led] involved a high value car, �50.000, driven at  high
       speed and dangerously. It was crashed  and  written  off.  It  caused
       damage to a number of other vehicles.


    He made it clear that only the 'totality  principle'  had  led  him  to
    sentence the appellant to no more than 18 months' imprisonment on  this
    indictment.


 6. The judge did not find it necessary to refer to the PSR, which  was  in
    short form, though clearly written by an experienced probation officer,
    who was well aware of the seriousness of the appellant's offences.  She
    noted the appellant's history of abuse of class 'A' drugs since he  was
    15, and his assurance that he was "willing  to  address"  it,  inspired
    particularly by his baby-mother and their young son (to whom  we  shall
    of course return). Simply on the  basis  of  the  appellant's  previous
    convictions, at a time when he was still  only  21,  the  report-writer
    assessed his likelihood of reconviction as 'high', with a 'medium' risk
    of harm to the public, since he had sold drugs outside his own circle.

 7. The panel noted, as we have done, the appellant's criminal  record  and
    the sentencing judge's remarks. They also noted that, though  he  would
    not be subject to automatic deportation if  his  removal  would  (under
    article 8 of the Human Rights Convention) be  disproportionate  to  the
    legitimate purposes of immigration control  and  prevention  of  crime,
    account still had to be taken of the guidelines  in  N  (Kenya)  [2004]
    EWCA Civ 1094 and OH (Serbia) [2008] EWCA Civ  694.  They  cited  these
    authorities, and others on the same lines, at some length, and there is
    no need for us to repeat what they said: it has all recently  been  re-
    emphasized in AP (Trinidad and Tobago) [2011] EWCA Civ 551,  which  the
    panel noted, and in RU (Bangladesh) [2011] EWCA Civ 651, not  published
    in time for them to take account of.

 8. The panel also referred to JO (Uganda) [2010] EWCA Civ 10,  though  not
    on its main point of interest for us, which is in the Court of Appeal's
    summary at paragraph 21 of the well-known decision in Maslov v  Austria
    1638/03 [2008] ECHR 546:


        "Where the person to be deported is a young adult who has  not  yet
        founded a family life of his own, the subset of criteria identified
        in para 71 of the  Maslov  judgment  will  be  the  relevant  ones.
        Further, paras 72-75 of that judgment underline the  importance  of
        age in the analysis, including  the  age  at  which  the  offending
        occurred and the age at which the person came to the host  country.
        This is pulled together in para 75: for a settled migrant  who  has
        lawfully spent all or the major part of his or  her  childhood  and
        youth in the host country, very serious  reasons  are  required  to
        justify expulsion; and this is all the more  so  where  the  person
        concerned committed the relevant offences as a juvenile."


 9. In all, Mr Hopkin was certainly not wrong, in his very fair  and  well-
    balanced  submissions,  to  describe  the  panel's  decision  as   both
    thoughtful and scholarly. They could not possibly be faulted  on  their
    review of the authorities, and they may understandably have  considered
    themselves bound to make it as extensive as they did in  the  interests
    of the appellant, unrepresented before them, as now,  as  well  as  the
    public interest in this class of case.

10. It should not be necessary however for panels dealing with  such  cases
    to carry out the review of the authorities over six pages  out  of  the
    panel's 18-page decision. What is needed, where as usual in a  case  of
    this kind there is no dispute about the requirements of the law, is  to
    show that the basic principles have been understood, and applied to the
    individual facts of the case in hand.

11. In our view those basic principles, on the public interest side of  the
    balancing exercise, are as follows; we have set out the authorities  on
    which they are based in foot-notes, to make it clear that there  is  no
    need for further reference to them by panels:

     a) In a case of automatic deportation[1], full account must  be  taken
        of  the  strong  public  interest  in  removing  foreign   citizens
        convicted  of  serious  offences,  which  lies  not  only  in   the
        prevention of further  offences  on  the  part  of  the  individual
        concerned, but in deterring others  from  committing  them  in  the
        first place[2];
     b) Deportation of foreign criminals expresses  society's  condemnation
        of serious criminal activity and promotes public confidence in  the
        treatment of foreign citizens who have committed them[3];
     c) The starting-point for assessing the facts of the offence of  which
        an individual has been committed, and their effect on  others,  and
        on the public as a whole, must be the view taken by the  sentencing
        judge[4];
     d) The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis of  the  situation  at
        the date of the hearing;
     e) Full account  should  also  be  taken  of  any  developments  since
        sentence was passed, for example the  result  of  any  disciplinary
        adjudications in prison or  detention,  or  any  OASys  or  licence
        report;
     f) In considering the relevant facts  on  'private  and  family  life'
        under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, "for  a
        settled migrant[5] who has lawfully spent all or the major part  of
        his or her childhood and youth  in  [this]  country,  very  serious
        reasons are required to justify expulsion"[6];
     g) Such serious reasons are needed "all the more so where  the  person
        concerned committed the relevant offences as a juvenile"  [7];  but
        "very serious violent offences can justify expulsion even  if  they
        were committed by a minor"[8] . Other very  serious  offending  may
        also have this consequence.


12. Returning to the facts of the individual case in hand, the  panel  were
    certainly wrong, as will already be clear from what we have said  about
    ground 2, to take the view that the appellant had not been convicted of
    any offence of dishonesty such as theft or  fraud.  However,  they  had
    clearly not overlooked  the  burglary,  since  they  had  set  out  the
    sentencing judge's remarks on it in  full  at  paragraph  50,  and,  at
    paragraph 18, the appellant's own frank admission that it had been done
    to order, to get hold of the cars involved in the  aggravated  vehicle-
    taking.

13. The most that can be said is that the panel  may  have  over-emphasized
    the relative importance of the drugs offence, for which  the  appellant
    had to receive a sentence in line with others dealt with  at  the  same
    time; and of the burglary and aggravated vehicle-taking, on  which  his
    sentence could and had to be reduced on the totality principle. It  was
    a bad domestic burglary, planned with  others,  and  involving  serious
    disturbance of people in the house, and taking two cars, the object  of
    the burglary, no doubt with keys found inside the house,  and  crashing
    one of them.

14. Going back to grounds 1 and 3, the panel set out in full, at  paragraph
    76, the risk assessment in the PSR. However, they went on to say this:


       There is no evidence before us to indicate  whether  that  assessment
       which is almost 2 years old is still valid. If all the  bulk  of  the
       Appellant's problems in the past have been attributable to  his  drug
       use it may well be that if he continues to  remain  drug  free  there
       will be a corresponding reduction in his risk of reoffending.

15. Mr Hopkin noted that the panel had expressed doubts, at  paragraph  20,
    about the appellant's claim that he had  funded  his  drug  habit  from
    money given to him by his brother; at paragraph 23, they had noted that
    it had continued at a time when he was already with Jade Millard.  Here
    we need to go further into the background. The appellant had since 2008
    had a relationship with Jade, a British citizen born on 17 April  1990,
    as a result of which she had conceived (just before he was arrested for
    the burglary) their son Tymari, born on 6  March  2009;  but  they  had
    never lived together till after  the  panel's  decision,  when  another
    first-tier judge released the appellant on bail,  pending  the  present
    appeal by the Home Office.

16. Mr Hopkin went on to make the point that the panel  had  not  expressed
    any concluded view, in the passage cited  at  13,  as  to  whether  the
    appellant's crimes had been the result of drug abuse or  not.  However,
    it seems to us that, when they posed the condition "if he continues  to
    remain drug free", they were  implicitly,  but  clearly  accepting  his
    evidence (supported by Jade, as far as  she  could,  on  the  basis  of
    regular visits to him in prison) that he was now off  drugs  -  not  an
    inevitable result of imprisonment, as everyone these days  knows.  They
    were entitled to do that (and, as it will turn out, were right  on  the
    facts to do so): the rest of what  they  said  in  this  passage  is  a
    question of risk assessment, on  which  they  were  fully  entitled  to
    express themselves in terms of probabilities.

17. There is also the consideration, whose  importance  was  underlined  in
    Maslov, that this appellant, was only 20 at the  time  of  any  of  the
    offences for which he was sentenced to imprisonment. Despite  his  long
    list of previous offences this was his first experience of a  custodial
    sentence. The impact of  such  a  sentence  on  him  was  an  important
    consideration.

18. Clearly  the  offences  for  which  the  appellant  was  sentenced  did
    represent a marked aggravation of his offending behaviour; but a  first
    sentence of imprisonment, especially if it is as long as this one  was,
    may have a rehabilitative effect on a  young  offender  whose  problems
    seemed to be linked with his abuse of drugs.  The panel had evidence of
    his progress in prison as do we.  The Secretary of State has  helpfully
    obtained the appellant's  prison  medical  records  before  making  the
    decision in this case. They revealed that he had regularly tested  drug
    free during his imprisonment. They were also entitled to  take  account
    of his own assurances of reformation in the light of his  sentence  and
    his new responsibilities as a father , as they were supported  by  oral
    evidence from Jade, based on her regular visits to him in  prison  with
    their child Tymari.

19. We are far from saying that we should have reached the same  result  as
    the panel on the evidence before them at the date of the hearing;  but,
    that is not the test we apply to this appeal. This was  a  meticulously
    reasoned decision addressing very carefully the issue of likelihood  of
    re-offending on which the decision maker placed reliance  in  the  well
    reasoned decision letter to which we  should  also  pay  tribute.   The
    panel did not fall into the error of treating this as the only relevant
    consideration but it was a very important one in the case  of  a  young
    offender who has been resident here for half his life.

20. The panel made no error of law in  their  self  directions.   The  slip
    about no offence of dishonesty was clearly just that and the panel  had
    well before them the true nature of the offending. Their conclusions on
    proportionality and the overall balance of the competing considerations
    were ones they were entitled to reach on the evidence.

21.  The appellant understandably did  not  appreciate  the  issue  of  law
    involved; but we heard what he had to say for himself, and  he  did  so
    most effectively, not only by assuring us that he had put crime and the
    drugs that had led him to it behind him, but by producing a very recent
    (7 December) letter from his probation officer, making it  quite  clear
    that he had tested negative for illicit drugs ever since  his  release,
    and co-operated well with that service so far in their efforts to  help
    him and set him on the road to finding work. This information  supports
    the information before the panel. It would have been of much importance
    if we had decided to remake the decision for ourselves; but, from  what
    we have already said, there is  no  basis  to  set  aside  the  panel's
    decision and it will remain undisturbed.

22. We hope that this will be  some  encouragement  for  the  appellant  to
    remain drug free, avoid criminal conduct and to do  his  best  to  find
    work and provide for himself and his family. We repeat what we told him
    at the conclusion of the hearing.  He should be well aware that, if  he
    committed any further significant offence,  whether  punishable  by  12
    months' imprisonment or not,  then  it  would  be  fully  open  to  the
    Secretary of State to take fresh proceedings to deport him.  Since  the
    appellant in such an eventuality would not have the  benefit  of  youth
    and a first experience of a custodial penalty, and would have  betrayed
    the opportunity for rehabilitation  offered  him  by  society  and  the
    trust placed in him by  his  own  family,  an  appeal  against  such  a
    decision on human rights grounds would be unlikely to succeed. We trust
    that a record will made of these comments by the Secretary of State.

Secretary of State's appeal dismissed.
