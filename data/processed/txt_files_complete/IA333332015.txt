Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms G Peterson, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Turkey, has  permission  to  challenge  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal (FtJ) Judge I Ross sent on 24  November
    2016 (following a hearing on 27 October  2016)  dismissing  his  appeal
    against a decision made by the respondent on 7 October 2016 refusing to
    vary leave to remain.

2.   The appellant's first ground takes issue with  the  fact  that,  having
    announced at the end of the hearing that he will allow the appeal,  the
    FtT judge dismissed it.  This was said to be contrary to  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber)  Rules
    2014 which govern procedure when the Tribunal gives a  decision  orally
    at a hearing, rules 29, 31 and 32.  Rule 29 provides:

         "29 - (1)     The Tribunal may give a decision orally at a hearing.

             (2)  Subject to rule 13(2) (withholding information likely  to
                  cause serious harm), the Tribunal  must  provide  to  each
                  party as soon as reasonably  practicable  after  making  a
                  decision (other  than  a  decision  under  Part  4)  which
                  disposes of the proceedings -

                  (a)  a notice of decision stating the Tribunal's decision;
                      and

                  (b)  notification of  any  right  of  appeal  against  the
                      decision and the time within which, and the manner in
                      which, such right of appeal may be exercised.

             (3)  Where the decision of the Tribunal relates to -

                  (a)  an asylum claim or a humanitarian  protection  claim,
                      the  Tribunal  must  provide,  with  the  notice   of
                      decision in paragraph (2)(a), written reasons for its
                      decision;

                  (b)  any other matter, the Tribunal  may  provide  written
                      reasons for its decision but, if it does not  do  so,
                      must notify the parties of the right to apply  for  a
                      written statement of reasons.

             (4)  Unless  the  Tribunal  has  already  provided  a  written
                  statement  of  reasons,  a  party  may  make   a   written
                  application to the Tribunal for such statement following a
                  decision which disposes of the proceedings.

             (5)  An application  under  paragraph  (4)  must  be  received
                  within 28 days of the date on which the Tribunal  sent  or
                  otherwise provided to  the  party  a  notice  of  decision
                  relating  to  the   decision   which   disposes   of   the
                  proceedings.

             (6)  If a  party  makes  an  application  in  accordance  with
                  paragraphs (4) and (5) the Tribunal must, subject to  rule
                  13(2) (withholding a document  or  information  likely  to
                  cause serious harm), send a written statement  of  reasons
                  to each party as soon as reasonably practicable.

3.   The Procedure Rules  do  allow  at  rule  31  for  correcting  clerical
    mistakes, accidental slips or  omissions  but  do  not  allow  for  the
    complete reversal of a decision.

         "Clerical mistakes and accidental slips or omissions

         31.  The Tribunal may at any time correct any clerical  mistake  or
             other accidental slip or omission in a decision, direction  or
             any document produced by it, by -

             (a)   providing  notification  of  the  amended  decision   or
                  direction, or a copy  of  the  amended  document,  to  all
                  parties; and

             (b)   making  any  necessary  amendment  to  any   information
                  published  in  relation  to  the  decision,  direction  or
                  document."

4.   The same  Rules  also  provide  for  setting  aside  a  decision  which
    disposes  of  proceedings.  This  power  is  subject  to  a  number  of
    conditions which are set out at rule 32(2).

5.   The grounds submit that as none of the  conditions  listed  at  r.32(2)
    exist in this case, the notice of decision should have  reflected  that
    given at the hearing.

6.    In  advance  of  the  hearing  the  Upper  Tribunal  issued  a  notice
    confirming that the FtT judge's record of proceedings states  that  the
    judge "will allow the appeal".

7.   I heard submissions from both parties on the correct interpretation  of
    rules  29,  31  and  32.   I  readily  concede  that  the   matter   of
    interpretation  that  arises  in  this  case  is  not  free  of  doubt,
    particularly bearing in mind [51] of Patel & Ors v SSHD (Rev 1)  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 1175. The Rules at some  points  do  appear  to  differentiate
    between 'decision' and 'reasons for a decision: see e.g. rule 29(3)(a).
    However, I am persuaded that Mr Wilding is right to say that  the  term
    'decision' in rule 29(1)  can  only  mean  a  decision  accompanied  by
    reasons and cannot simply mean a mere statement of  outcome.   That  is
    essentially for two reasons.  One is that by virtue of rule  29(2)  the
    decision must be one that "disposes of the proceedings" and a  decision
    without reasons cannot achieve that.  The other (and my primary reason)
    is that the terms of r.29(3), which require "written  reasons  for  its
    decision" (mandatory in an asylum claim or  a  humanitarian  protection
    claim; optional on any other matter) presuppose, in my view, that  some
    reasons have been given orally.  In my view, r.29 does not address  the
    situation, such as arose in the appellant's case, of a FtT judge merely
    announcing without giving reasons that he  will  allow  a  decision  on
    appeal.  If it did it would have the effect of preventing a judge  from
    changing his or her mind, a possibility which  cannot  legitimately  be
    removed by procedural rules (see cases cited at  [49]-[50]  of  Patel),
    since the effective date of decision can only be when  a  tribunal  has
    given reasons for that decision.

8.   However, it does not  follow  from  my  rejection  of  the  appellant's
    reliance on r.29 (and 32) that the appellant's first ground must  fail.
    The first ground had an implied additional limb:  procedural  fairness.
    As Mr Wilding conceded, any decision made by a tribunal must be subject
    to the rules of procedural fairness.  As already observed, it  is  open
    to a judge who has announced at a hearing that he or she will allow  or
    dismiss an appeal, to change his or her  mind  subsequently.   However,
    what he must do, if he or she  is  minded  to  change  the  result,  is
    explain to the parties why he or she has done this and afford  them  an
    opportunity to comment.

9.   Mr Wilding accepts that there is a  rule  or  principle  of  procedural
    fairness as I have just described but submits that on its own  it  will
    not establish a material error of law if it was incapable of  affecting
    the outcome of the decision.  I would agree but this does not  help  Mr
    Wilding's efforts to resist the first ground of  appeal  in  this  case
    because on the given evidence the appellant's case was not one that was
    bound to fail under the relevant Immigration Rules.

10.  The relevant Immigration Rules in the appellant's case were  those  set
    out as long ago as 1972 in para 210 of  HC  510  which  so  far  as  is
    relevant provides:

         "People admitted as visitors may  apply  for  the  consent  of  the
         Secretary of State to their establishing themselves  here  for  the
         purpose of setting up in business, whether on their own account  or
         as partners in a new or existing business.  Any such application is
         to be considered on merits.  Permission will depend on a number  of
         factors, including evidence that the  applicant  will  be  devoting
         assets of his own to the business, proportional to his interest  in
         it, that he will be able to bear his share of any  liabilities  his
         business may incur, and that his  share  of  its  profits  will  be
         sufficient to support him and any dependants.  The applicant's part
         in the business must not amount to  disguised  employment,  and  it
         must be clear that he will not  have  to  supplement  his  business
         activities by employment for which a work permit is required...".

     This provision has been preserved by operation of the Ankara  Agreement
    and guidance on how to apply it has been  given,  inter  alia,  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in EK (Ankara Agreement -  1972  Rules  -  construction)
    Turkey [2016] UKUT 425 (IAC).

11.  On the evidence before the FtT judge there  was  a  live  issue  as  to
    whether the appellant could meet the requirement  "that  the  applicant
    will be devoting assets of his  own  to  the  business".   It  was  the
    appellant's evidence that he  met  this  requirement  in  that  he  had
    �2,000, an amount in excess of the �1,560.90 amount  specified  in  his
    business plan.  The appellant claimed that he had this amount of  money
    (he produced the sum in cash at the hearing) and that it was  an  asset
    of his own although he accepted his girlfriend was the source  of  that
    money.  For the judge  the  fact  that  he  girlfriend  had  given  the
    appellant the money was fatal to his claim that it was his  own  money.
    He states at paras 13 and 14 as follows:

         "13. I am satisfied that the appellant enthusiastically  wishes  to
             set up a computer  repair  business,  as  he  did  in  Mexico.
             However, I have to look  at  the  merits  of  his  application
             including the factors set out paragraph 21 of HC 510, set  out
             above.  The business plan identifies the start-up  costs  will
             be �1,560.90.  It is clear that the  appellant  himself,  does
             not possess that amount of money, otherwise there  would  have
             been no necessity to obtain that money from his girlfriend.

         14.  The appellant has to show, that he will be  devoting  his  own
             assets to the business.  Whilst there is the appellant's  oral
             evidence and  his  girlfriend's  letter,  that  she  gave  him
             �2,000, there is no formal deed  of  gift  showing  that  this
             money  is  not  repayable.   Further,  whilst  appellant  gave
             evidence that he could not open a bank account,  there  is  no
             evidence of the absence of any  overseas  bank  account,  into
             which  he  could  have  transferred  the   �2,000   from   his
             girlfriend.  I find it incredible that the appellant, who  has
             Mexican citizenship and was a businessman in Mexico, does  not
             have any bank account."

12.  Ms Peterson submits that the judge clearly erred  in  paragraph  14  in
    that the Rules do not require assets received by way of a  gift  to  be
    evidenced by way of a formal deed of gift.  I consider that  submission
    to be arguable.  Indeed, the judge's subsequent statement (that he took
    into account the failure of the appellant's girlfriend  to  attend  the
    hearing which had the result that "the assertion that the money was  an
    unconditional  gift  being  totally  untested  or  confirmed  in   oral
    evidence") appears to indicate that (contrary  to  what  he  stated  at
    paragraph 13) it may have been possible for the appellant to  establish
    the money was unconditionally his by non-formal means.

13.  On the matter of the absence of the appellant's girlfriend (it is  said
    the couple are no longer in a relationship), I am troubled by the  fact
    that  the  judge  gave  no  consideration  to  whether  there   was   a
    satisfactory explanation for her absence.   The  appellant  had  stated
    (see paragraph 8) that "[s]he was unable to attend the hearing  as  she
    works as a Health Care Assistant in an  acute  stroke  unit".   It  was
    incumbent on the judge to state why that explanation was  not  accepted
    or why the witness's evidence would not have been capable of  affecting
    assessment of the appellant's assets.  In contrast to some employments,
    required attendance at an acute  stoke  unit  (if  proven)  could  have
    severe consequences for people's lives.

14.  It was suggested by Mr Wilding that even leaving to one side the  issue
    of the �2,000, the appellant could not have  succeeded  anyway  because
    the judge stated at paragraph 16 that:

         "16. Further, in the absence of any assets other than the  start-up
             money, I find that the appellant has not shown that  he  could
             bear the burden of any liabilities which may  be  incurred  by
             the  business.   It  is  unclear  to  me  on  what  basis  the
             anticipated profits have been calculated in the business plan,
             given that the nature  of  the  business  depends  on  one-off
             repairs, rather than repeat business."

15.  However (i) it is not clear whether  in  paragraph  16  the  judge  has
    applied requirements that only become part of the Immigration Rules  in
    versions subsequent  to  the  1972  one;  (ii)  as  the  judge  himself
    correctly observed at paragraph 17, the requirements  of  paragraph  21
    "must not be applied too rigidly and that a failure to comply with  one
    of  the  listed  factors  should  not  necessarily  be  fatal  to   the
    application"; (iii)  hence,  at  the  very  least,  the  judge,  having
    announced at the hearing that he will allow the appeal, was obliged  to
    explain why he decided in his written  decision  that  the  appellant's
    inability to show he could "bear the burden of any liabilities" was  in
    his view decisive; and (iv) as noted in the appellant's ground  2,  the
    basis of the anticipated profit was not an issue raised in the  refusal
    letter nor put to the appellant at the hearing and  the  business  plan
    took account of ongoing maintenance.

16.  In short, the appellant's case under paragraph 210 was  not  one  which
    lacked a realistic prospect of success or was bound to fail.

17.  In such circumstances, I have no  hesitation  in  concluding  that  the
    judge's  decision  must  be  set  aside  for  material  error  of   law
    necessitating that there be a further hearing.

Direction

1.   I direct that at the next hearing the appellant's  (former)  girlfriend
    is afforded a further opportunity  to  attend  and  give  evidence.   I
    further direct that she produces a letter from her employer  confirming
    that on 27 October 2016 she was required to attend her employment at an
    acute stroke unit.  If the (former) girlfriend considers that  the  new
    date fixed for hearing conflicts with her employment duties,  she  will
    be required (a) to submit a letter from her employers confirming  this;
    and (b) to submit dates within the 28 days  immediately  following  the
    date fixed for hearing when  she  would  be  able  to  attend  to  give
    evidence.

2.   I consider that this case is to be remitted to the FtT to be  heard  by
    a judge other than Judge I Ross.


Notice of Decision

The decision of FtT Judge Ross is set aside for material error of  law.  The
case is remitted to the FtT before a judge other than Judge Ross.

No anonymity direction is made.
