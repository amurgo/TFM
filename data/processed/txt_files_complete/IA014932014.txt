    For the Respondent:     Mr Aslam, Counsel, instructed by Bedfords
    Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India. On January 27, 2009 the  appellant
    was granted leave to enter the United Kingdom as a student until August
    31, 2010. On December 24, 2010 he was leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post
    Study Work) migrant until December 24,  2012.  On  March  31,  2011  he
    applied to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until March  31,  2013.
    On March 18, 2013 he applied to remain  here  as  a  Tier  1  (General)
    Migrant but the respondent refused this  application  under  paragraphs
    39B(c), 322(1A) and (2) HC 395.

 3. The appellant appealed that decision on December 24, 2013 under section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The  matter
    came  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Pears  (hereinafter
    referred to as the "FtTJ") on  January  29,  2015  and  in  a  decision
    promulgated on February 10,  2015  he  allowed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules and in the alternative he found the decision was  not
    in accordance with the law.

 4. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on February 13, 2015 submitting
    the FtTJ had erred by failing to give adequate reasons for the  finding
    the respondent had  failed  to  demonstrate  the  appellant  had  acted
    dishonestly and secondly by making the  alternative  findings  he  did.
    Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Murray found there  was  an
    arguable error in law for the reasons raised.

 5. The matter came before me on  the  above  date  and  the  parties  were
    represented as set out above.

 6. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 and I see no reason to alter that order

SUBMISSIONS ON ERROR IN LAW

 7. Mr Avery adopted his grounds of appeal and argued the FtTJ erred in his
    whole  approach  to  the  issue  of  whether  the  appellant  had  been
    dishonest:

      a. His approach to the issue of whether  there  was  a  deception  was
         baffling because on the one hand the respondent was criticised  for
         the way in which she made enquiries but she was then criticised for
         making those enquiries.

      b. The appellant accepted the figures given to the  HMRC  on  his  tax
         returns were significantly lower than the  income  claimed  by  the
         appellant. In  those  circumstances  the  respondent  examined  his
         income from his self-employment in more detail and  the  respondent
         took steps to contact the appellant's clients  but  was  unable  to
         verify  the  information.  The  respondent  demonstrated  that  the
         appellant had been dishonest in declaring his income and  the  FtTJ
         erred by failing to find that the appellant was dishonest.

      c. The appellant may have provided his explanation  but  how  credible
         was it the appellant would believe he did not need  to  declare  an
         income that led to him having to pay an additional ï¿½17,242 in  tax?
         Mr  Avery  submitted  it  lacked  credibility  that  this   was   a
         misunderstanding and the FtTJ erred by accepting his explanation.

      d. The FtTJ had accepted  in  paragraph  [34]  that  the  respondent's
         conclusions were appropriate but then found the  respondent  failed
         to show reasonable cause to doubt the genuineness  of  the  dispute
         invoices or that she had  taken  reasonable  steps  to  verify  the
         documents. These findings conflict.

      e. The FtTJ failed to examine the seven invoices and only  had  regard
         to  one  of  them  and  he  then  accepted,   without   any   other
         consideration,  the  appellant's  explanation.  His   findings   in
         paragraph [36] of his determination are unsustainable and the  FtTJ
         failed to give any explanation for his findings.

      f. The FtTJ further erred in making an alternative  finding  that  the
         decision was not in accordance with the law in  circumstances  when
         the  FtTJ  himself  accepted  the  respondent's  conclusions   were
         appropriate.

 8. Mr Aslam submitted the arguments advanced today went far and beyond the
    grounds of appeal. The only ground of appeal  was  that  the  FtTJ  had
    failed to give adequate reasons for  finding  the  respondent  had  not
    demonstrated  the  appellant  had  acted  dishonestly.  The  FtTJ   had
    addressed this issue in his determination in  paragraph  [34]  when  he
    accepted the appellant proffered an innocent explanation. The FtTJ gave
    his reasons and in the circumstances there was no merit to  the  ground
    of appeal pleaded. He submitted  that  Mr  Avery  was  now  seeking  to
    challenge the FtTJ's approach to the whole issue when the  respondent's
    challenge had been to the FtTJ's finding the respondent had  failed  to
    demonstrate the  appellant  was  dishonest.  As  regards  the  disputed
    invoices the FtTJ considered the evidence and  found  discrepancies  in
    the respondent's paperwork. The appellant had  produced  evidence  that
    demonstrated his figures were accurate and he preferred the appellant's
    evidence.

 9. I reserved my decision.

CONSIDERATION AND FINDING ON MATERIAL ERROR OF LAW

10. In considering whether there has been an error I remind myself  of  the
    grounds of appeal and the reason permission was given.

11. Paragraph [2] and [3] of the grounds read-

         "2. The S of S checked the income details with HMRC and found  them
         to be at variance with HMRC records-see paragraphs 7 and 18 of  the
         determination.

         3. The Immigration Judge has made a finding at paragraph [34]  that
         the appellant has not been dishonest and the S of S has  failed  to
         meet  the  burden  on  her  to  show  that  the   appellant   acted
         dishonestly. It is submitted that entirely inadequate reasons  have
         been given for this  finding.  Such  a  failure  to  give  adequate
         reasons is a material error in law"

12. In giving permission to  appeal  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Murray found there had  been  an  arguable  error  because  by
    "under-declaring" his income  to  save  tax  the  appellant  had  acted
    dishonestly and this amounted to an error.

13. Mr Aslam took issue with the permission on  two  grounds.  Firstly  the
    judge  referred  to  the  wrong  paragraph  and  secondly,   and   more
    importantly, he submitted the appellant had never accepted he had under-
    declared his income to save tax.

14. There appears no dispute that the figures provided to the respondent on
    income were considerably higher than the figures provided to HMRC.  The
    respondent refused the application under paragraph 39B(c) HC 395.  This
    states-

         "If  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  or  Secretary  of  State   has
         reasonable cause to doubt the genuineness of any document submitted
         by an applicant which is, or which  purports  to  be,  a  specified
         document under these Rules, and having taken  reasonable  steps  to
         verify the document is unable to verify that  it  is  genuine,  the
         document will be discounted for the purposes of this application."

15. The respondent then went onto refuse the application  under  paragraphs
    322(1A) because-

         "... false representations have been made  or  false  documents  or
         information have been submitted (whether or  not  material  to  the
         application, and whether or not to the applicant's  knowledge),  or
         material  facts  have  not  been  disclosed,  in  relation  to  the
         application, or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary  of
         State or a third party required in support of the application.

16. The respondent refused it under the discretionary ground  contained  in
    paragraph 322(2) which  states  leave  to  remain  should  normally  be
    refused where

         "The making of false representations or the failure to disclose any
         material fact for the purpose of obtaining  leave  to  enter  or  a
         previous variation of leave, or in order to obtain  documents  from
         the Secretary of State or a third party required in support of  the
         application for leave to enter or a previous variation of leave."

17. Although the FtTJ was provided with additional material on the  day  of
    the hearing the decision he had to  make  centred  on  the  appellant's
    actions and his decision to provide the respondent and  the  HMRC  with
    different figures. He had to decide whether  the  appellant  had  acted
    dishonestly.

18. He correctly reminded himself that the respondent bore  the  burden  to
    show the appellant had acted dishonestly and she had to  show  this  on
    the balance of probabilities.

19. The starting point for the FtTJ had to be the  application  form  dated
    February 4, 2011. The appellant completed this form and stated at  [K4]
    his source of income for self-employment purposes  between  October  4,
    2010 and February 4, 2011 was ï¿½36,481. In support he produced his  bank
    statements, accountant's letter and business invoices.

20.  However,  when  the  respondent  checked  his  income  with  HMRC  she
    discovered for tax year 2010/2011 he disclosed ï¿½4,634  from  his  self-
    employment at the Surgery and ï¿½1,731.42 from other employment. For  tax
    year 2011/2012 he disclosed  ï¿½6,114  from  his  elf-employment  at  the
    surgery and ï¿½1,071 for other employment. These figures cast doubt  over
    his declared earnings in his 2011 application form  and  of  course  it
    followed that if the HMRC figures were the correct figures he would not
    have scored the points claimed in [K7] on his 2011 application form.

21. The respondent considered  the  appellant's  income  and  accepted  the
    salary of ï¿½7,661.57 from the Surgery was accurate but  she  took  issue
    with the ï¿½29,607.45 he claimed to have earned from his  self-employment
    activity and gave her reasons why  she  only  accepted  his  income  as
    ï¿½19,017.45. In short, she had  been  unable  to  confirm  some  of  the
    invoices and consequently she discounted them. The  respondent  ignored
    the disputed seven invoices under paragraph 39B HC 395 and  the  result
    was a reduced net profit of ï¿½17,793.  This  figure  together  with  the
    salary of ï¿½7,661.57 gave a total of ï¿½25,454.57 and  only  entitled  the
    appellant to 5 points.

22. The FtTJ recorded at paragraph  [18]  of  his  determination  that  the
    appellant did not dispute  the  respondent's  claim  he  had  submitted
    figures to the HMRC that were significantly lower. The FtTJ accepted in
    paragraph [34] that based on her enquiries with  HMRC  her  conclusions
    were appropriate.

23. The  respondent  refused  the  application  because  she  believed  the
    appellant had submitted a false document.

24. However, in assessing whether there had been any  dishonesty  the  FtTJ
    had to consider what the  appellant  submitted  to  the  respondent  as
    distinct from what had been submitted to HMRC.

25. On the evidence the FtTJ was satisfied the figure  on  the  application
    form was correct. He explained his reasoning in his determination.

26. If the FtTJ had  concluded  the  evidence  submitted  on  or  with  the
    application form had been false then he would no doubt have  reached  a
    different conclusion.

27. The penalty for understating his income to HMRC was a financial penalty
    but as this was not something submitted to the  respondent  to  support
    his application this is not a document the FtTJ had to concern  himself
    with.

28. The FtTJ preferred the  evidence  of  the  appellant  to  that  of  the
    respondent as to the appellant's income. That was a conclusion  he  was
    entitled to reach. His finding is not perverse. He importantly accepted
    the appellant's income was as claimed on the  application  form.  There
    was nothing in the papers submitted to the respondent  that  indicated,
    based on the FtTJ's findings, the appellant acted dishonestly.

29. I accept the respondent quite properly refused the application when  it
    was submitted because there were issues between the form  submitted  to
    her and that submitted to HMRC. The whole point of an appeal process is
    to deal with matters such as those raised in the  refusal  letter.  The
    appellant addressed the concerns to  the  FtTJ's  satisfaction  and  in
    doing so the FtTJ was entitled to reject the  respondent's  submissions
    that the application should be refused.

DECISION

30. There was no material error. I uphold the FtTJ's decision.
