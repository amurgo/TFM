Representation
For the appellant:     Ms S Jegarajah, Counsel instructed  by  Duncan
Lewis & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr K Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This appeal comes before the Upper Tribunal as a result of  a  consent
    order made on 28 February 2013 by the Court of Appeal directing a fresh
    hearing. The members of this panel have shared the preparation of  this
    determination.


2.    The appellant is a citizen of C�te d'Ivoire born on 14 July  1986.  He
    arrived in the UK on 24 August 1992, aged six, and was admitted for six
    months. His mother had arrived here  in  November  1990  and  she  then
    applied to include him as a dependant of her asylum claim. On 19 August
    1999 the appellant and his mother  were  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain outside the rules under a  backlog  clearance  exercise.  On  25
    February 2009, as a result of criminal offending and  convictions,  the
    Secretary  of  State  notified  the  appellant  of  his  liability   to
    deportation and on 22 April 2009 a deportation  order  was  signed  and
    served upon him  along  with  a  letter  giving  reasons  for  same.  A
    subsequent decision under section 32 (5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 was
    made on 4 March 2011. An appeal against that decision has led to  these
    proceedings.

3.    The appellant's history  of  convictions,  adjudications  against  him
    whilst in prison/detention, aliases he has used, attempted removals and
    failures to report is as follows;

      Offending history:

      The remarks of the sentencing judges in 2008 and 2009:

      12 September 2008:

      "Stand up please Mr Gnayoro. Mr Gnayoro, I sentence you on Count 6  of
    this indictment, the Crown having accepted your pleas of not guilty  on
    the remaining counts. On the facts as presented to this  court  it  was
    indeed a  sustained  attack  on  a  woman,  sustained  as  demonstrated
    objectively by the extent of her injuries. Mr Evans, I think, is  right
    in saying that they were not life threatening but they  were  extensive
    and to various parts of her body quite clearly  indicative  of  a  good
    kicking. She would of course at the time have been in very real fear of
    you; she was at the time  defenceless.  The  siting  of  the  injuries,
    including those to her face, tell me that. You come before the court as
    a  man  with  an  indifferent  record;  apparently  you   are   already
    demonstrating indifference to the hurt to others  and  a  (in)different
    response to community orders as and when they would be imposed. I  take
    into account your plea; it was late, it was at the door of  the  court.
    It was always open to you, Mr Gnayoro, to say that what  you  had  told
    the police in respect of the assault was not right and that  your  were
    prepared to plead to  that  single  count.  I  take  into  account  the
    guidelines to which I have been directed; they are of course guidelines
    only...the sentence of the court is one of 50 weeks custody".

      15 January 2009:

      "Alex Gnayoro,  you  have  pleaded  guilty,  I  accept  at  the  first
    opportunity, to an offence contrary  to  Section  20  of  the  Offences
    Against the Person Act 1861, unlawful  wounding,  or  causing  grievous
    bodily harm. On 11 October, within a short time of being released  from
    prison on 12 September - that was last year - you become involved again
    in a violent incident, as you know. I accept what  Miss  Scrivener  has
    said on your behalf - that there  was  an  element  of  provocation;  I
    accept that you did not invite the eventual injury, or the assault,  on
    Mr Passmore, but he sustained serious injuries in the incident in which
    you have pleaded guilty; he sustained wounds to his  cheek  and  thumb,
    and required stitches for those injuries; and you, and you  alone,  are
    responsible for those injuries, as you know.

      I accept that this was not a premeditated assault, as  Miss  Scrivener
    has submitted; I also accept what she  says  on  your  behalf  that  in
    relation to your last conviction you in fact ended up  serving  some  3
    months or so longer as a sentence than the court eventually  considered
    was required. I do, as I say, give you  the  maximum  credit  for  your
    plea. You know of course that this offence easily  passes  the  custody
    threshold, and you know the risks  you  run  by  becoming  involved  in
    violent incidents. You need, when you are  faced  with  this  situation
    again, to walk away immediately before it develops into a situation  in
    which you become involved.

      In all the circumstances I accept Miss Scrivener's  submission  to  me
    and the sentence of the court will be one of 18 months' imprisonment".

4.    The appellant is known to have used 10 aliases:
      Ashley Douglas
      Ellis Johns
      Alex Gnaoro
      Alex Thibault
      Alixe Gnayoio
      Alrx Tiboult Gnayono
      Alex Gnayoro
      Alex Thbault Gnayoro
      Alex Thibault Gnayoro
      Alex Thiboult Gnayoro

      And two different dates of birth:
      24 March 1984
      17 July 1986.

5.     Whilst  in  prison  and  immigration  detention   there   have   been
    adjudications against the appellant. Those  which  follow,  between  31
    March 2010 and 25 January 2012 are taken from the bail summary  in  the
    appellant's bundle  2  (green  folder)  submitted  by  the  appellant's
    representatives;

      31 March 2010 "having a fight and using an unauthorised drug".

      18 May 2010 "having an unauthorised item in his possession".

      6 June 2010 "being in a place where he shouldn't be".

      18 June 2010 "being in a place where he shouldn't be".

      30 June 2010 "using an unauthorised drug and fighting".

      3 June 2011 "possession of an unauthorised item".

      4 July 2011 "assault on a prison officer".

      17 November 2011 "possession of cannabis  and  fighting  with  another
    prisoner".

      25 January 2012 "fighting with another prisoner

      The bail summary ends on 30 January 2012. We have  not  been  provided
    with any official  list  of  adjudications  since  then.  However,  the
    appellant has provided  information  about  adjudications  against  him
    since that date. We take the following from his witness statement;

      27 July 2012 he pleaded guilty to having  a  controlled  drug  in  his
    urine (cannabis). It is not clear what his  sentence  was  but  it  was
    suspended for three months.

      2 August 2012 he pleaded guilty to assault and  was  sentenced  to  14
    days solitary confinement.

      17 January  2013  he  pleaded  guilty  to  having  a  controlled  drug
    (cannabis) in his urine.

      20 February and 22 March 2013 the appellant was  accused  but  cleared
    of having a controlled drug (cannabis) in his urine. He says  that  his
    explanation that his drinks had been spiked was accepted.

      26 March 2013  the  appellant  pleaded  guilty  to  assaulting  prison
    officers and was sentenced to 28 days solitary confinement.

      15 April 2013 the appellant pleaded guilty to assault and  destruction
    of property. It was said that he had spat  in  the  face  of  a  prison
    officer and ripped a notice board off the wall.

      10 June 2013 the appellant was accused of disobeying a  lawful  order.
    He says that the hearing has been adjourned.

6.    Removal directions set and cancelled:

      27 July 2010: disruptive behaviour
      11 August 2010: disruptive behaviour
    7 October 2010: disruptive behaviour
      14 October 2010: dirty protest
      30 November 2010: disruptive behaviour
      3 December 2010: asylum application received
      16 January 2012: appeal resurrected after signing of disclaimer

7.    There have also been several failures to  report  to  the  Immigration
    Service whilst on bail and/or temporary release:

      5 November 2009
      6 November 2009
      14 December 2009
      21 December 2009

8.    According to the bail summary and the appellant's oral  testimony,  he
    entered  immigration  detention  on  9  April  2010.  There   is   some
    contradiction in his evidence over whether he has remained incarcerated
    ever since. His witness statement of 15  May  2011  (at  paragraph  11)
    records that he was released on  bail  from  immigration  detention  in
    October 2010 but recalled on 23 December 2010 for two violations of his
    bail but the contents of the bail summary indicate  that  these  events
    occurred in 2009 and not 2010.

9.    Litigation history:

      The appeal against the deportation order made on 22 April  2009  under
    the provisions of section 32 of the 2007 Act was  dismissed  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne  on  23  June  2009.  Reconsideration  was
    ordered but the appeal was dismissed  again  by  Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Manuell  on  29  April  2010  and  an  application  for
    permission to appeal was refused by the Upper Tribunal on 17 June 2010.
    Grounds for a judicial review were  lodged  on  27  July  2010  however
    permission was refused on 10 September 2010.

10.   Removal directions were set for 7 October 2010, 14  October  2010  and
    30 November 2010 however due to the appellant's disruptive behaviour on
    each occasion; the removals had to be cancelled.


11.   On 2 December 2010 the appellant claimed asylum on the basis  that  he
    would be at  risk  on  account  of  his  religion  (Islam),  his  tribe
    (unspecified) and the political activities of his father.  A  screening
    interview  was  conducted  on  8  December  2010,  the  appellant   was
    interviewed on 22 December 2010 and the application was  refused  on  4
    March 2011. In refusing the application, the respondent noted that  the
    deportation order of 2009 remained valid, that the appellant would  not
    be at risk of serious harm if returned to the C�te  d'Ivoire  and  that
    despite his long residence here, removal would not be  disproportionate
    under Article 8. He was also refused humanitarian protection.

12.   The appeal against that decision was  heard  at  Richmond  Magistrates
    Court on 15 August 2011 by a panel chaired by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Lingard and dismissed by way  of  a  determination  promulgated  on  30
    August 2011. Permission to appeal was refused by Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    McGeachy on 19 September 2011 but  was  granted  on  renewal  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Warr on 14 October 2011, it being  found  arguable  that
    the panel needed to engage more specifically  with  the  principles  in
    Maslov v Austria (1638/03) [2008]  ECHR  546  and  ?ner  v  Netherlands
    [2006] ECHR 873 bearing in mind the appellant's length of residence.

13.   The matter then came before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kebede  at  Field
    House on 18 April 2012; she dismissed the appeal on 23 April  2012.  An
    application for leave to appeal against that decision was refused on 24
    May 2012 but, undeterred, the appellant applied for a second appeal  to
    the Court of Appeal. The matter came before the  Right  Honourable  Sir
    Stephen Sedley who, on 2 August 2012, adjourned the application pending
    compliance with certain directions for missing evidence. Thereafter, on
    5 December 2012, permission to  appeal  was  granted.  A  statement  of
    reasons was agreed between the parties and  on  28  February  2013  the
    court ordered that the case be  remitted  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for
    reconsideration upon Maslov  grounds  and  without  any  consideration,
    directly or indirectly, of the statements  of  Constables  Pounder  and
    Back which had been put before the Tribunal on previous occasions.

14.   At subsequent hearings before  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Freeman  on  29
    April and 16 May 2013, documents relating to the  intelligence  reports
    were removed from the Tribunal file altogether and the  respondent  was
    directed to redact certain parts of the OASys report which referred  to
    them.  The matter then came before us on 11 July 2013.

The hearing

15.   Upon the commencement of the hearing,  efforts  were  made  to  ensure
    that all the documents relied upon by the parties had been received  by
    the Tribunal. Both sides submitted additional documents.

16.   We heard  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant  and  his  mother.  The
    appellant adopted his witness statement in Appellant's Bundle  1  (AB1)
    and confirmed he was happy to rely on its contents. He also adopted the
    statement in Appellant's Bundle 2 (AB2) which  he  explained  had  been
    prepared for one of his bail hearings. He stated that  the  police  had
    attended three bail hearings and at one of those  hearings  an  officer
    had given evidence for some seven minutes about matters not related  to
    his convictions.

17.   The appellant stated that he had never indulged  in  any  drugs  other
    than cannabis. He had been on prescribed medication which included  co-
    codemol, diazepam, fluoxetine and antibiotics. He explained that he had
    smoked cannabis in prison due to depression and  peer  pressure.  As  a
    result of the adjudications he had received  in  prison,  he  had  lost
    privileges. He stated that if allowed to remain in the UK, he would not
    smoke cannabis or commit further crimes. He attributed taking drugs  to
    depression and anxiety over his mother's health. He explained  that  he
    had been prescribed fluoxetine some 2  �  years  ago  but  had  stopped
    taking it for about a year because he had to wake up early in order  to
    receive it. He resumed taking it after his transfer to  HMP  Thamesmead
    where he "got into trouble" again. The appellant confirmed that he  had
    been in four different institutions during his  immigration  detention;
    two were immigration detention centres and two  were  prisons.  He  was
    currently in prison. He did  not  have  the  same  mental  health  team
    looking after him but his history was known to the new team  each  time
    he moved. He did, however, think that little attention had been paid to
    him whilst at the immigration detention  centres.  He  stated  that  he
    thought he had been on suicide watch about three times. He had  seen  a
    psychiatrist once.

18.    With  respect  to  his  criminal  offences  and  adjudications,   the
    appellant stated that he had been  young  when  he  had  committed  his
    crimes and had made many mistakes. He stated his mother was ill and the
    only thing that would make her happy would be if he went to college. He
    had thought of following  a  plumbing  course  or  becoming  a  fitness
    instructor. He stated he was haunted by his last offence. He served  12
    months in prison for it and was then on licence with a curfew between 7
    PM and 7 AM and a requirement to see his probation officer once a week.
    He stated that he had been in immigration  detention  since  completing
    his sentence. That completed the examination in chief. There was no re-
    examination.

19.   In response to questions from the bench, the appellant stated that  he
    had raised mitigating circumstances for the adjudications in prison. He
    said he had been in prison for four years and had spent a lot  of  time
    thinking about his life. He had seen the stress and pain his mother had
    gone through. He wanted to make her happy. He stated that he had always
    lived with her. When he was  reminded  that  he  had  stated  in  other
    evidence (at his hearing before Judge Manuell)  that he had been living
    with his girlfriend in Exeter, he said he only spent three days a  week
    with her and the rest of the time lived at  home  and  attended  church
    every Sunday. He was asked to clarify why he had claimed to be a Muslim
    when he claimed asylum. He stated that he had converted to Islam whilst
    in detention in 2009 or 2010 but had reverted  to  Christianity  since.
    The appellant stated that he was his mother's only  child.  His  father
    had two additional sons, Yves and Gregory. When asked if he  knew  Diwo
    Aboubakar Seni (said by his mother in her statement to be her son), the
    appellant agreed that he was his stepbrother but  maintained  they  did
    not get on. His father had passed  away  in  2011.  He  had  previously
    claimed that his father had died because his  mother  had  always  said
    that he was dead. The appellant stated that he had been back  to  visit
    the Cote d'Ivoire twice. His mother had  also  been  twice,  with  him.
    There were no questions arising from either representative.

20.   We then heard evidence in French from  the  appellant's  mother,  Dede
    Jacqueline Lipke. She confirmed her address and  stated  that  she  was
    generally in poor health. She had arrived in the UK  in  1990  and  had
    been working ever since as a cleaner.  She  had  finished  her  morning
    shift before the hearing, having worked from 6:30 AM until  9  AM.  She
    spent her money  on  rent,  taxes  and  her  family,  specifically  the
    appellant.  Prior  to  obtaining  legal  aid,  she  had  paid  for  the
    appellant's representation.

21.   The witness was asked about her ability to influence the appellant  in
    respect of his criminal behaviour. She stated that  she  had  tried  to
    talk to him as a mother and whilst he was in  prison  she  had  visited
    regularly and they had spoken a lot. She thought that  she  would  have
    influence over him. She stated that  her  visit  had  also  helped  the
    appellant as he knew that she was there to  support  him.  His  removal
    would impact upon her. He had no other family. She  had  two  children,
    the appellant and Seni. That completed the examination in chief.  There
    was no re-examination.

22.   In response to questions from the bench, the witness stated that  Seni
    was with  his  father  (not  the  appellant's  father)  in  Ghana.  She
    confirmed that was the reason for her visit to Ghana. She  stated  that
    she had travelled to the C�te d'Ivoire on two  occasions  since  losing
    her mother and to Ghana once. She travelled alone. She had  funded  her
    journeys herself.

23.   In response to questions from Mr. Norton, the witness stated that  she
    had travelled when her mother died; that was the last occasion. She had
    been twice with the appellant when his  father  was  still  alive.  The
    purpose of the visit had been to meet up with him. She  clarified  that
    in total she had been back on two occasions. That  completed  the  oral
    evidence.

24.   Ms Jegarajah's submissions were lengthy. In her skeleton argument  she
    raised three issues which had not formed part  of  the  consent  order.
    These were that, in accordance with UKBA policy, the respondent and the
    Tribunal  should  not  have  any  regard  to  the   appellant's   spent
    convictions, that the respondent had acted unlawfully and prejudicially
    by introducing intelligence from the police relating to the appellant's
    non-convictions and thirdly, that  the  respondent  had  pressured  the
    appellant into signing a disclaimer to withdraw his asylum appeal after
    permission to appeal had been granted. As Mr. Norton did not object  to
    any of these arguments being introduced, counsel  was  given  leave  to
    argue them.

25.   We sought clarification from the parties  as  to  the  nature  of  the
    present appeal, there being no fresh deportation order,  no  indication
    that the 2009 order  had  been  withdrawn  and  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant had sought a revocation of that order. After some discussion,
    Counsel conceded that the present appeal was  a  pure  Article  8  case
    which had to be assessed in the light of the extant deportation  order.
    We have, therefore, proceeded on that basis.

26.   In view of the new issues raised, Ms Jegarajah  led  the  submissions.
    She reminded us that following guidance in Maslov, very serious reasons
    were required to justify expulsion. The Tribunal should  recognise  not
    just that the appellant entered as a minor and committed offences as  a
    minor, but also that he had spent a very long time  living  in  the  UK
    which meant that great weight should be attached to his  private  life.
    It was submitted that the appellant's mother was seriously  unwell  and
    evidence of this was contained in the bundle. There was a genuine close
    relationship between them.

27.   Ms Jegarajah then took us  through  the  appellant's  convictions  and
    maintained that all those prior  to  16  March  2007  were  spent.  She
    withdrew her earlier submission, and accepted that  the  appellant  had
    been a minor only when the first offence in 2002 had been committed. It
    was accepted thereafter he  had  reached  his  majority.  Reliance  was
    placed upon section 4 of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act  1974  and
    it was argued that the appellant should be treated as someone  who  had
    never been convicted with regard to the spent convictions. Ms Jegarajah
    submitted that in accordance with section 7 (3), it was a  question  of
    discretion as to whether  those  convictions  were  considered  by  the
    Tribunal. She submitted that items 1, 2 (i), and 2 (ii) on the PNC list
    were  spent  although  upon  further  examination  of  the   dates   of
    conviction, the appellant's date of birth and the date the  deportation
    order was signed, she accepted that they had not been  spent  when  the
    respondent signed the order. She argued that because the appellant  had
    been  in  immigration  detention  since  the  completion  of  his  last
    sentence, he had not had any opportunity to  show  his  rehabilitation.
    She stated he would  be  permanently  ostracised  if  he  had  to  keep
    referring to spent convictions. It was  not  the  case  here  that  the
    appellant had a history of serious convictions which had  escalated  in
    violence or seriousness. There was a public interest in  rehabilitating
    foreign deportees. The OASys report was  the  only  evaluation  of  the
    appellant's conduct and re-offending. She submitted there were concerns
    about the report because the conclusions had  been  reached  with  non-
    admissible information in mind. As such, little weight should be  given
    to it. She submitted  that  with  respect  to  the  last  offence,  the
    sentencing judge had accepted that alcohol had been involved  and  that
    the injured party was not the intended victim.


28.   It was submitted  that  there  had  been  a  long  litigation  history
    because material not relevant to the appellant's convictions  had  been
    put forward. The Secretary of State had attempted in this way to submit
    incriminating material  and  had  acted  in  a  way  that  damaged  the
    appellant's case. She questioned why this had been done.  She  reminded
    us that a police officer had attended the bail hearing and  given  oral
    testimony  about  non-convictions.  She  submitted   that   prejudicial
    information had adversely  affected  the  appellant.  He  had  been  in
    immigration detention since 2010. He had been on  suicide  watch  as  a
    result of his lengthy detention. She referred us to the  medical  notes
    which she submitted painted a different picture of the  appellant  then
    that depicted by the respondent. He was trying to rehabilitate himself.
    In  conclusion  she  submitted  that  the  appellant's  expulsion   was
    disproportionate given the length of his residence and the guidance  in
    cases such as Maslov and ?ner.

29.   We then  heard  submissions  from  Mr.  Norton.  He  took  us  to  the
    determination of Designated First-tier Tribunal judge Manuell which, he
    reminded us, had not been set aside. He pointed out that Judge  Manuell
    specifically  attached  no  weight  to  what  had  been  described   as
    prejudicial evidence. He further  submitted  that  this  had  not  been
    relied on by Judge Lingard either. He submitted  that  the  reason  the
    respondent had agreed to a consent order was because the  reasoning  of
    Judge Lingard on Maslov principles was not clear. He submitted that the
    respondent had not sought to rely on the police reports following Judge
    Manuell's determination and this had been specifically clarified in the
    submissions made by the Presenting Officer  before  Judge  Lingard.  He
    argued that the details set out in the bail summaries had nothing to do
    with the police reports. In any event, he rejected the submission  that
    evidence  of  non-convictions  was  unlawful  or  inadmissible  and  he
    referred us to the cases of Bah (EO-  Turkey  -  liability  to  deport)
    [2012] UKUT 00196 (IAC) and Farquharson (removal -  proof  of  conduct)
    [2013] UKUT 00146 (IAC) both of which  dealt  with  such  evidence.  He
    submitted that the relevance of such information had to be assessed and
    that it was then a matter of weight. He accepted that it  was  open  to
    the Tribunal to attach less or no  weight  to  conduct  which  did  not
    result in a conviction but this did not mean that such evidence  should
    be disregarded. He also referred us to the judgment in  V  [2009]  EWHC
    1902 (Admin) in the respondent's bundle (at paragraph 48).

30.   With respect to the issue of spent convictions, Mr. Norton  relied  on
    AA (spent convictions) Pakistan [2008] UKAIT 0027. He  also  argued  an
    analogy with AG (Kosovo) [2007] UKAIT 00082 and maintained that where a
    conviction was unspent at the date of the decision (in  this  case  the
    deportation order on 22 April 2009), an appellant  should  not  benefit
    from it being spent at a later date simply due to the protracted appeal
    procedure. He submitted that only  the  2002  conviction  of  receiving
    stolen goods was irrelevant to  the  Tribunal's  consideration  as  the
    appellant had been 16 at the time that offence had been committed.

31.   As regards the  allegation  that  the  respondent  had  pressured  the
    appellant  into  signing  a   disclaimer,   he   submitted   that   the
    circumstances in which the disclaimer was signed were set out  in  AB2.
    Contrary to what was argued, it was the Secretary  of  State  who  made
    concerted efforts to have the appeal reinstated.

32.   Mr. Norton submitted  that  the  appellant  had  a  serious  offending
    history and had been found to be of high risk of harm to the public and
    of reconviction. He accepted that  time  had  passed  since  the  OASys
    report had been prepared but he drew our attention to  the  appellant's
    behaviour in custody and the number of  adjudications  against  him  as
    relevant evidence of his conduct. He pointed to the  findings  of  fact
    made in the determination of Judge Manuell and submitted  that  nothing
    had changed in relation to those facts. In conclusion, he relied on the
    reasons for refusal letter of April 2011 which, he submitted, dealt  in
    depth with the Article 8 claim. He asked that the appeal be dismissed.

33.   Ms Jegarajah made a brief reply. She asked that we look  carefully  at
    the grant of permission by the Court of Appeal  which  raised  concerns
    about the continuing validity of the judgment in V.  She  also  pointed
    out that Bah related to old style deportation appeals.

34.   Submissions having been completed, we reserved our determination.

Appellant's case

35.   The appellant's claim is contained  in  his  oral  evidence  (detailed
    above) and in the three witness statements prepared during  the  course
    of this lengthy litigation. Essentially the  appellant  relies  on  his
    relationship with his mother who is said to be his only close relative.
    His relationship with his girlfriend in Exeter, which was  relied  upon
    in an earlier appeal hearing, ended a few years ago whilst  he  was  in
    prison. Although he received an  education  at  primary  and  secondary
    schools in London, he obtained very few or no qualifications (it is not
    clear which). His maternal aunt and her family also live in the UK. The
    appellant maintains that he feels himself to be an Englishman and  that
    he has no family or connections with  the  Cote  d'Ivoire.  He  has  no
    employment history other than brief intermittent work in a  restaurant.
    He expresses great remorse for his criminal offending and  assures  the
    Tribunal that he will not re-offend.

36.   The appellant also sets out mitigating circumstances for some  of  the
    adjudications listed above and for his crimes.

37.   There are a number of contradictions in his evidence with  respect  to
    his father, his and his mother's visits to the Cote  d'Ivoire  and  the
    number and whereabouts of his siblings. He has repeatedly  stated  that
    he is his mother's only child whereas her evidence is that she has  two
    sons. When this was put to him at the hearing, he  conceded  he  had  a
    half brother on his mother's side. He also has two half-brothers on his
    father's side. The OASys report records that the appellant said he  had
    a brother living in France working as an engineer for  a  large  mobile
    phone  company  and  another  aged  24  (now  28)   studying   computer
    engineering in London. His father is said to have nine children  living
    in the C�te d'Ivoire (six boys and three girls).

38.   In his oral evidence and his witness statement of 19  September  2012,
    the appellant maintains that he has visited the Cote  d'Ivoire  on  two
    occasions in 1999 and 2005. He states on both occasions he visited  his
    father and other relatives. According to endorsements in this passport,
    however, he visited in 2001, 2002  and  twice  in  2004.  Although  his
    mother maintained in her evidence that she had only visited twice,  the
    written evidence indicates that she visited on the  same  occasions  as
    the appellant and additionally in 2010.

39.   He states that he only speaks broken French however at  his  interview
    he gave French as one of the two languages that he spoke and it is  the
    case that his mother with whom he claims to have a  close  relationship
    speaks very little English.

40.   He attributed his criminality to the use of  cannabis,  alcohol,  peer
    pressure, school problems and depression on account of his mother's ill
    health.

41.   His father has been said at different times  to  be  living  in  Togo,
    France or to have been killed prior to November 1990 or at  some  point
    thereafter, or to have died of cancer in 2011.

42.   The appellant maintains that his mother is  very  ill  and  needs  his
    help. He claimed both that he always lived with her  and  that  he  had
    moved to Exeter to live with a girlfriend.

Discussion, findings and conclusions

Spent Convictions

43. Although  not  referred  to  in  her  skeleton  argument  Ms  Jegarajah
    submitted that some of the appellant's convictions were spent under the
    provisions of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974, should not have
    been relied on by the respondent and could not be taken into account by
    the Tribunal. She said that the point had  been  mentioned  at  earlier
    hearings. Whilst Mr Norton might have argued that  the  respondent  had
    not had notice of the point he did not object  and  said  that  he  was
    prepared  to  deal  with   it.   We   heard   submissions   from   both
    representatives. Ms Jegarajah provided us  with  an  extract  from  the
    respondent's Immigration Directorate Instructions  (IDIs).  During  the
    course of the hearing we accumulated copies of  the  Rehabilitation  of
    Offenders Act 1974, AA (spent convictions) Pakistan [2008]  UKAIT  0027
    and R on the application of V [2009] EWHC 1902 (Admin).  We  have  also
    drawn assistance from Ogundimu (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria  [2013]
    UKUT 60 (IAC).

44.   Section 7(3) of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974  provides  as
    follows:

      "If at any stage in any proceedings before a  judicial  authority  in
         Great Britain ... the authority is satisfied, in the light  of  any
         considerations which appear to it to  be  relevant  (including  any
         evidence which has been or may thereafter be put before  it),  that
         justice cannot be done in the case except by admitting or requiring
         evidence  relating  to  a  person's   spent   convictions   or   to
         circumstances ancillary thereto, that authority may  admit  or,  as
         the case may be, require the evidence in  question  notwithstanding
         the provisions of subsection  (1)  of  section  4  above,  and  may
         determine any issue to which the evidence relates in disregard,  so
         far as necessary, of those provisions"

45.   We find that the  summary  of  AA,  prepared  by  the  author  of  the
    determination, correctly summarises the law.  It  states;  "Convictions
    that are 'spent' for the purposes of the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders
    Act 1974 should not normally be the subject  of  reference  in  appeals
    before the Tribunal. The exception is in  s  7(3)  of  the  Act,  which
    allows spent convictions to be  proved  if  the  interests  of  justice
    require it: it is for the Respondent to prove that they do."

46.   Paragraphs 40 and 41 of Ogundimu state;

      "40. In a case of this sort, where the Secretary of State relies on a
         persistent course of conduct rather than a single  serious  offence
         to justify  deportation,  it  is  of  importance  to  look  at  the
         appellant's offending behaviour as a whole. It is the Secretary  of
         State's case that the appellant's offending behaviour escalated and
         would  continue  to  do  so.  It  would  be  artificial   in   such
         circumstances to consider only the most  very  recent  convictions.
         We therefore  directed  that  we  would  admit  the  whole  of  the
         appellant's criminal record when we re-made the decision, in  order
         to obtain a complete picture. The weight to be  attached  to  spent
         convictions is a very different matter, but their relevance is  the
         information they throw on the strength of the  public  interest  in
         deporting the appellant for his most recent offending.

      41. We also observe that where persistent criminal conduct is  relied
         on, it is important for the judge to have the full Criminal  Record
         Office printout  rather  than  just  a  summary  of  the  dates  of
         convictions. The full list assists discovery of when the  offending
         occurred, whether it was in breach of a  Community  Order,  whether
         the appellant was on bail at the time of the offending,  and  other
         data about the sequence of the offending. We  pointed  out  at  the
         hearing that any suggestion that the Data Protection Act restricted
         disclosure of such information to a court is misconceived."

47.   The question also arose as to the date  at  which  the  assessment  of
    whether a conviction was spent should be made. Ms  Jegarajah  submitted
    that it should be the date of the hearing before us. Mr  Norton  argued
    that it should be the date of the respondent's decision.  Neither  gave
    as any authority for  their  proposition.  We  find  that  if  such  an
    assessment has to be made  it  should  be  made  at  the  date  of  the
    respondent's  relevant  decision.  As  long  as  the  correct  date  is
    identified it is then a fixed point which does not  change  during  the
    course  of  protracted  proceedings  such  as  these.  Ms   Jegarajah's
    submission would result in a moving target with the result that for the
    same appellant in the same proceedings convictions properly  considered
    at one point would become spent over time and potentially fall  out  of
    consideration. We conclude that this would not be the correct  approach
    and find that the point of decision, throughout the proceedings, is the
    date of the respondent's decision. Normally that is  not  difficult  to
    ascertain. In this case there are two possible dates. We find that  the
    correct date is the earlier date  on  which  the  respondent  made  the
    deportation decision, namely 22 April 2009.

48.   If we assess the question of what convictions  were  spent  as  at  22
    April 2009 there were two; his caution for assault on 1 July  1998  and
    his conviction for handling  stolen  goods  (receiving)  at  Camberwell
    Green Youth Court on 26 January 2002 where the outcome was  a  referral
    order for four months. Coincidently these were the two  offences  which
    preceded his 18th birthday.


49.   The application of Maslov principles (Maslov  v.  Austria  -  1638/03
    [2008] ECHR 546 (23 June 2008) where one of the  essential  factors  is
    the nature and gravity of the offences committed by the appellant means
    that in our judgement we need to look at  the  whole  history  and  any
    pattern  of  offending,  the  seriousness  of  the  offences  and   the
    appellant's ages when offending started and finished. If  one  or  more
    offences are excluded because they are spent it could give a misleading
    picture.  In  this  case  the  offences  which  would   fall   out   of
    consideration if treated as spent would be those committed  before  the
    appellant became an adult. In 1998 the appellant was 11 or 12 years  of
    age. In 2002 he was 15 or 16. Whilst the  offence  of  handling  stolen
    goods in 2002 does not  fit  the  overall  pattern  of  offending,  the
    assault in 1998 is relevant to the offences of violence which followed.
    We find that the respondent has proved that the  interests  of  justice
    require all of  the  appellant's  criminal  record  to  be  taken  into
    account.

The prejudice point

50.   In paragraph 11 of  her  skeleton  Ms  Jegarajah  submits  that;  "The
    weight to be attached to the public interest in  preventing  crime  and
    disorder must be greatly reduced in this appeal because of the  way  in
    which the SSHD has acted towards the A(ppellant).  She  has  sought  to
    prejudice the appellant's case by (1) attempting to make  him  withdraw
    his appeal after PTA (permission  to  appeal)  had  been  granted,  (2)
    attempting to subvert the rule of law by introducing materials that are
    now accepted were included unlawfully and (3) by seeking to detain  the
    appellant by introducing evidence that would not be  admitted  in  this
    appeal. For those reasons the weight to be attached to  the  deployment
    of the public interest  in  this  particular  case  should  be  greatly
    reduced". We have added numbers to this passage to make  it  easier  to
    identify the three elements it contains.

51.   In reply to our question, Ms Jegarajah accepted that the points  which
    we have numbered 1 and 3 had not been raised  before  the  Tribunal  or
    notified to the respondent  prior  to  the  delivery  of  her  skeleton
    argument on the morning of the hearing. She said that  point  2  was  a
    natural consequence of the matters raised before the Court  of  Appeal.
    However, Mr Norton did not object and indicated that he  was  ready  to
    deal with these points.

52.   The accusation  that  the  respondent  has  sought  to  prejudice  the
    appellant's case is a serious one and it is for the appellant to  prove
    this, to the standard of the balance of probabilities. In  relation  to
    the first point, that the respondent attempted to  make  the  appellant
    withdraw his appeal after permission to appeal  had  been  granted,  Ms
    Jegarajah's submissions shed no light on this. We have  not  been  told
    how it arises, who is alleged to have done what and whether  there  are
    any relevant documents. The point is not made out.

53.   In her submissions Ms Jegarajah accepted that  the  second  and  third
    points are interrelated. They  relate  to  the  same  or  very  similar
    evidence. Paragraph 2 of the judgement of Hughes LJ in  this  case  (28
    February 2013) refers to the question of whether any Tribunal judge  or
    panel dealing with this appeal  erred  by  taking  into  account;  "Two
    statements of police officers which recounted intelligence  information
    received by the police suggesting unlawful  (principally  drug  supply)
    activity by the appellant and association with firearms. The sources of
    that information was stated generally, although  not  entirely,  to  be
    informants unidentified, but with the kind  of  assessment  of  general
    reliability which such reports are generally given". The order  of  the
    Court of Appeal dated 28 February 2013  stated,  in  paragraph  3,  "On
    remission there be no direct  or  indirect  reference  to  the  witness
    statements of PC Pounder and  DC  Back  or  the  information  contained
    therein". We have not seen these statements  and  documents  before  us
    have been redacted to remove reference to them.

54.   It is alleged that the respondent introduced "materials that  are  now
    accepted were included unlawfully". It is recorded in paragraph  14  of
    the Statement of Reasons annexed to the order of the  Court  of  Appeal
    that the  respondent  no  longer  relied  on  the  police  intelligence
    reports. The Court of Appeal declined to adjudicate on  the  point.  We
    have not been shown any evidence which either states  or  implies  that
    the respondent accepted that this material was included unlawfully.  No
    such inference can be drawn from the fact that it was no longer  relied
    on by the respondent. We find that there  has  been  no  acceptance  or
    finding that materials were included unlawfully. The evidence before us
    does not established that it was included unlawfully.

55.   In relation to point 3 Ms Jegarajah submitted that  a  police  officer
    attended bail hearings before the First-Tier Tribunal and gave evidence
    in relation to what were described as "non-convictions" which,  we  are
    given to understand, is similar material to that complained of  in  the
    proceedings before the Court of Appeal. She  accepted  that  there  was
    nothing in principle which would make it  inappropriate  for  a  police
    officer to attend and give evidence at a bail  hearing.  She  drew  our
    attention to a report from the  representative  who  appeared  for  the
    appellant at the bail hearing 21 January 2013  (page  31A  of  the  new
    bundle), which includes the passage; "There was evidence  given  by  DC
    Burrows, at the invitation of the IJ. He repeated the opinion  that  he
    gave on page 8 of the remand application, to the effect that Mr G posed
    a significant threat to the public  if  released.  However,  in  cross-
    examination he accepted that this opinion was based in part on the non-
    convictions disposals and that the actual convictions provided  a  much
    lower degree of support."

56.   Page 29A of  the  same  bundle  containing  the  judge's  reasons  for
    refusing bail which includes  the  passage;  "Today  I  heard  from  DC
    Burrows. I find that his evidence is persuasive  and  I  give  it  some
    weight. I do not pay any regard to the "non-convictions".  Even  though
    the appellant has been in detention for a long time and even though  he
    is not imminently removable I  find  that  his  attitude  to  bail  and
    restrictions in the past taken together with the risk which he poses to
    the public make him unsuitable as a candidate for bail."


57.   In  his  evidence  in  chief  before  us  the  appellant  adopted  and
    confirmed the accuracy of his witness statement dated 19 September 2012
    which appears between pages 20 and 24 of the same new  bundle.  We  are
    surprised that he should have been asked to do so or that once  he  had
    done so we were not asked to  exclude  some  or  all  of  it  from  our
    consideration. A large part of the statement is taken up by  explaining
    why had not been involved  in  an  attempted  rape  (falsely  accused),
    possession of a firearm with intent in an  incident  where  shots  were
    fired at  the  police  (not  involved),  robbery  (arrested  but  never
    charged, actual bodily harm (for  which  he  was  convicted),  grievous
    bodily harm (for which he was convicted) and non-compliance  with  bail
    conditions (explained as a minor infraction).

58.   We have studied the voluminous material contained in  the  appellant's
    new bundle submitted on the day  of  the  hearing.  Whilst  they  share
    common factors we prefer the judge's reasons for refusing bail  to  the
    note prepared by the appellant's representative. The  appellant  had  a
    long history of failure to comply with the  reporting  requirements  of
    the criminal courts, several failures  to  report  to  the  immigration
    authorities, had used a number of  aliases  and  the  two  most  recent
    offences before he was sent to prison  involved  serious  violence.  We
    find that the appellant has not established that impermissible evidence
    was submitted which  caused  or  contributed  to  the  appellant  being
    refused bail. For the reasons we have already given the  appellant  has
    not established that material was included unlawfully in the appeal (as
    opposed to the bail) proceedings so that there is no  conclusion  which
    can be carried over for the benefit of his arguments in relation to the
    bail proceedings. We also find that the appellant has  not  established
    that the respondent has prejudiced or attempted to prejudice  his  case
    or subvert the rule of law. She has not relied on  material  which  was
    unlawful.

Razgar and Maslov assessments

59.   As can be seen from the summary of the appellant's evidence there  are
    a number of contradictions in the  appellant's  accounts  as  given  at
    various stages of  the  proceedings.  The  most  serious  discrepancies
    relate to the appellant's father. He is given different first names  in
    the evidence and at various points has been said to have  been  killed.
    In July 2009 the appellant gave  instructions  to  his  representatives
    that his father was in the government and had been murdered  (T13).  He
    further claimed that he could only vaguely remember his  father  as  he
    had not seen him since the age of six. Thereafter  in  April  2009  his
    instructions to his representatives as set out in the grounds of appeal
    and statement of additional grounds (K-12) were  that  his  father  had
    been killed in conflict by rebels prior to his mother's flight from the
    Cote d'Ivoire in 1990 (at paragraph 5). Those grounds  also  maintained
    that the appellant was working hard to tackle his  offending  behaviour
    and had not been in trouble since arriving in prison (at paragraph  7).
    In the grounds for judicial review prepared in September 2010  then  it
    was again maintained that the appellant's  father  had  died  when  the
    appellant was very young (at paragraph 3).  At  his  asylum  interview,
    however, he stated that his father  was  alive  and  travelled  between
    France and Togo. The medical notes record that he told various  medical
    personnel whilst in custody that his  father  had  died  of  cancer  in
    France in 2011 and that his body was being flown to the  Cote  d'Ivoire
    for burial. When asked to explain at the hearing why he had  maintained
    several times that he had lost his father as  a  child,  the  appellant
    said he was only repeating what his mother had told him.  However,  his
    recent witness statement and indeed his  mother's  oral  evidence  both
    indicate that the appellant met up with his father on  all  his  visits
    back to the Cote d'Ivoire, most recently in  2004  or  2005.  No  death
    certificate has been provided in respect of his father.  This  conflict
    in the appellant's evidence is unexplained  and  raises  doubts  as  to
    whether his father has passed away.

60.   We also find the appellant's evidence as regards his  siblings  to  be
    unreliable. There is no reason he would have lied to the author of  the
    OASys report about the number and whereabouts of brothers and  sisters.
    Indeed, the visits made by the appellant and his  mother  to  the  C�te
    d'Ivoire, despite a modest income on her part and the appellant's  lack
    of employment, support a finding that there are relatives still  living
    there.   The return of the appellant's father's body to  C�te  d'Ivoire
    for burial (if his death is to be accepted) also suggests ties with the
    country of origin.

61.   In his medical notes he is recorded as having told  the  doctors  that
    he was left in the care of his mother's friend after she  left  him  in
    the Cote d'Ivoire and that he was abused by this person  (p.  59).  His
    mother's evidence and indeed the evidence in  the  appellant's  witness
    statement is that he was left in the care of his maternal grandmother.

62.   The appellant states that he has always lived with his  mother,  other
    than when in custody, but a number of his offences  were  committed  in
    the south-west of England, as shown by his convictions  at  Exeter  and
    Bournemouth Crown Court. His place of residence and previous  residence
    as shown on the PNC  (respondent's  bundle  p.35)  and  on  his  prison
    medical notes (AB at page 36) respectively were  not  London  addresses
    and when giving evidence before the Tribunal in April  2010  he  stated
    that he had been living in  Exeter  for  some  years.  In  his  adopted
    statement of September 2012 he confirms that he had moved to Exeter  to
    live with his former partner at some point prior to September 2008  (at
    paragraph 18). His mother's witness statement of 9  May  2011  confirms
    the appellant's account that he was living in Exeter (at paragraph 10).

63.   The appellant maintains his mother is very ill and needs his help  but
    her evidence to the Tribunal in 2011 was that  she  was  well  and  had
    recovered from the brain haemorrhage she had in 1998. The brief medical
    evidence  submitted  indicates  that  she  suffers  from  hypertension,
    insomnia and low moods.  She has also acted strangely in  the  past  in
    that some years ago she ran naked down the street. However despite  her
    conditions, her evidence was that she has worked ever since her arrival
    in 1990 and continues to do so. There is no medical evidence  that  she
    suffers from a life threatening condition as the appellant maintains in
    his statement (at paragraph 20). Moreover it is not the case  that  she
    just has church members to turn to (paragraph 22). Her sister lives  in
    London and as can be seen from the medical  evidence,  assists  her  as
    well.

64.   There are no  statements  from  the  appellant's  maternal  aunt,  her
    husband or their children. There is no evidence that the appellant  has
    undertaken any courses to rehabilitate himself whilst in prison.

65.   In addressing the penalties he received for adjudications when  giving
    oral evidence, the appellant failed to mention the occasion when he was
    put into solitary confinement for 28 days for  his  conduct  (paragraph
    12; statement of 27 June 2013). Although he expresses regret for  drugs
    use and his violent behaviour in that  statement,  his  poor  behaviour
    continued as the repeated  adjudications  show.  For  eg.,  despite  an
    adjudication for having a controlled drug in his urine on 27 July  2012
    and expression of regret and remorse (paragraph 5), it can be seen that
    an adjudication for the  same  offence  occurred  on  17  January  2013
    (paragraph 9).

66.   The appellant has not founded a family of his own.  His  relationships
    with girlfriends have not lasted. He is not now in a  relationship  and
    he does not claim to have any children. His case needs to  be  assessed
    in line with the principles set out in Maslov.

The nature and seriousness of the offence committed by the applicant;

67.   We find that the respondent has proved that the interests  of  justice
    require all of  the  appellant's  criminal  record  to  be  taken  into
    account. These are set out earlier in this  determination.  We  do  not
    take into account any suggestions  that  the  appellant  has  committed
    criminal offences other than those for which he has been  convicted  or
    had adjudications against him.

68.   We have set out the appellant's convictions and adjudications  earlier
    in this determination.

69.   Most of the appellant's offences have been committed as an adult.  The
    OASYS report is dated 8 June 2009. The appellant was assessed as having
    a high risk of reconviction and, in the community, posing a low risk to
    children, medium risk to known adults and staff and a high risk to  the
    public. Ms Jegarajah asked us to place  little  or  no  weight  on  it,
    arguing that it was flawed  because  of  the  impermissible  input  and
    opinions from police officers. We have not seen what that was,  because
    the passages are redacted. However, not a great deal has been  redacted
    and the lengthy and detailed assessment which remains  provides  strong
    support for these conclusions. This is the only risk assessment  before
    us. There is nothing in the  appellant's  behaviour  since  then  which
    persuades  us  that  circumstances  have  changed  or  that  the   risk
    assessment  should  be  at  a  lower  level.  His  behaviour  indicates
    otherwise.

The length of the applicant's stay in the country from which he  or  she  is
    to be expelled;

70.   The appellant's mother came to the UK in November 1990. She  left  the
    appellant with his grandmother in C�te d'Ivoire. He joined her here  in
    August 1992 when he was six years of age. He has lived here ever since,
    nearly 21 years. We agree with the finding of the  Tribunal  in  August
    2011 that he has made visits to C�te d'Ivoire in 2001, 2002  and  2004.
    His mother accompanied him and also went there in 2010.  We  note  that
    their evidence as to the number of occasions has been inconsistent.  In
    August 1999 the appellant and his mother were granted indefinite  leave
    to remain exceptionally outside the  Immigration  Rules  under  special
    measures introduced to clear an asylum backlog.  The  appellant  gained
    indefinite leave in line with her. Since April 2009 the  appellant  has
    been trying to remove the appellant from the country. We have concluded
    that  the  appellant  has  not  established  that  the  respondent  has
    prejudiced or attempted to prejudice his case or subvert  the  rule  of
    law. She has taken legitimate steps to attempt to remove  him.  On  the
    other hand, the appellant has gone to great lengths to prolong his stay
    in this country not only through legitimate appeal processes but  other
    tactics such as failures  to  report  under  his  bail  conditions  and
    preventing removal by disruptive behaviour and dirty protest.

The time elapsed  since  the  offence  was  committed  and  the  applicant's
conduct during that period

71.   The last criminal offence  committed  before  the  appellant  went  to
    prison was in January 2009. He has not had the opportunity to show that
    he can stay out of trouble outside prison since  then  because  he  has
    been  in  prison,  either  serving  his  sentence  or  in   immigration
    detention. He has committed further offences  in  prison  both  against
    prison regulations and offences which would be criminal  if  they  were
    committed outside prison. The  most  recent  was  in  April  2013.  The
    appellant  has  provided  detailed  explanations  for  each  of   these
    adjudications. He attributes the need to use cannabis in prison to  the
    failure to provide him with proper medical treatment and medication. He
    needed this because of his  fear  of  being  deported,  depression  and
    concern about his mother. Further explanations as to  circumstances  of
    each offence minimise his involvement, place a  large  element  of  the
    blame on others and emphasise his remorse. There are five letters  from
    officers at the appellant's current prison either dated  or  apparently
    written in June 2013. They say that his behaviour has improved and that
    he is compliant with the regime, polite and respectful to staff. It  is
    acknowledged that he has not behaved  well  in  the  past.  He  is  now
    helping other prisoners and staff and forming  positive  relationships.
    We accept that these statements accurately reflect the current position
    over a short period. During this period the  appellant  has  been  well
    aware that his appeal hearing before  the  Tribunal  would  take  place
    soon. In view of his past history and repeated assertions that he is  a
    changed man we find that so short a period  of  improvement  is  not  a
    reliable indication that he is a reformed character.

The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the host  country  and
with the country of destination

72.   The appellant's first language is French acquired  in  C�te  d'Ivoire.
    He also speaks and gave evidence in  English.  His  mother's  preferred
    language is French and she gave  evidence  through  a  French  speaking
    interpreter. We find  that  the  appellant  probably  speaks  competent
    French learned in the country to which he would return  and  maintained
    in frequent conversations with his mother. He  had  some  schooling  in
    C�te d'Ivoire but was not happy in school. He has been educated in this
    country but truanted frequently and left  school  with  no  or  minimal
    qualifications (it is not clear which). He was not happy  at  secondary
    school in this country attributing much of this  to  racial  harassment
    and a violent environment. He had his face slashed in a  knife  attack.
    He has worked for a  few  months  in  this  country  and  has  received
    benefits for the rest of the time whilst not  in  prison.  His  father,
    from whom his mother was separated, was influential and  well  off.  In
    view of the conflicting evidence to which we have referred  we  do  not
    accept that he is no longer alive and no  longer  willing  or  able  to
    assist the appellant.  For  most  of  his  time  in  this  country  the
    appellant has lived with his mother. She has a number of family members
    here including  a  sister  who  attended  the  hearing  with  her.  The
    appellant has had a number of girlfriends but  the  relationships  have
    not proved durable and he is not currently in a relationship. It is the
    appellant's own evidence that he has few  friends.  He  attributed  his
    criminality to the use of cannabis, alcohol,  peer  pressure  from  bad
    company and problems including bullying at school.

73.    The  appellant's  mother  has  shown  him  unstinting  affection  and
    loyalty. She is on low earnings as a  cleaner  and  has  spent  a  high
    proportion of them on visiting and giving money to the  appellant.  She
    has suffered physical and mental ill-health. She has worked for all  or
    most of the time and was working on the morning of the hearing. She  is
    reluctant to agree to the medical treatment  which  she  needs  fearing
    that it may prevent her from visiting and helping  the  appellant.  She
    has family members including a sister in  this  country.  She  has  two
    children, the appellant and an elder half brother who may be living  in
    Ghana. History shows that she has not been able to  exercise  effective
    control over the appellant's behaviour. We find that the appellant  has
    only integrated into society in this country to a very limited  extent.
    He has a close relationship with his mother, closer on her side than on
    his. He is prepared to accept a substantial proportion of her earnings.

Conclusions

74.   The decision making and appeal history in this case  is  not  entirely
    clear.  However,  it   is   now   common   ground,   agreed   by   both
    representatives,  that  the  appellant's  appeal  rights  against   the
    deportation order dated 22 April 2009 have been exhausted so  that  the
    decision stands. The subsequent decision of 4 March 2011 to refuse  the
    appellant asylum is the decision against which this appeal was  brought
    albeit that it is now pursued only on Article 8 private  life  grounds.
    If his  appeal  succeeds  he  cannot  be  deported.  If  it  fails  the
    deportation order stands. Ms Jegarajah  confirmed  that  the  appellant
    relied on Article 8 private life in this country,  not  on  any  family
    life.

75.   We find that the first three of the Razgar questions are  answered  in
    the affirmative (Razgar, R (on the  Application  of)  v.  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27). This appeal turns on the
    fourth and fifth of the tests; "(4) Is such interference necessary in a
    democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety
    or the economic well-being  of  the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
    disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or  for  the
    protection of the rights and freedoms of others?" and (5)  "If  so,  is
    such interference proportionate to the legitimate public end sought  to
    be achieved?"

76.   Following the guidance  in  Maslov,  we  find  that  the  interference
    serves a legitimate aim, namely the "prevention of disorder or  crime".
    The main  issue  to  be  determined  is  whether  the  interference  is
    "necessary in  a  democratic  society".  It  will  not  be  unless  the
    respondent can show that there are  very  serious  reasons  to  justify
    expulsion. The relevant criteria are those which we have set out  under
    the above headings. In paragraph 75 of Maslov it is stated; "In  short,
    the Court considers that for a settled migrant who has  lawfully  spent
    all or the major part of his or her childhood and  youth  in  the  host
    country very serious reasons are required to justify expulsion. This is
    all the more so where  the  person  concerned  committed  the  offences
    underlying the expulsion measure as a juvenile." Here the appellant has
    spent the major part of his childhood and youth in the  UK  but  almost
    all of the offences we have taken into account were committed after  he
    became an adult. Looking at all  the  evidence  including  the  factors
    which we have set out in the round we conclude that the respondent  has
    shown that there are very serious reasons to justify the  expulsion  of
    the appellant.

77.   In these  circumstances  we  consider  whether  such  interference  is
    proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to  be  achieved?  We
    have found that, in relation to the legitimate public end sought to  be
    achieved, there are very serious reasons to justify  the  expulsion  of
    the appellant. The strongest elements of the appellant's  private  life
    in this country are his life with his mother and the length of time  he
    has  been  here.  He  has  few  friends,  no   other   close   personal
    relationship, has found it difficult to assimilate and has only  worked
    for a very short period. He has not acquired significant job skills. We
    do not believe that he lacks  relatives  in  C�te  d'Ivoire  who  could
    assist him and we find that even if his original French is rusty it was
    his first language and sufficient to live there whilst full fluency  is
    re-established. We conclude that the appellant has established that the
    removal  of  the  appellant  from  the  UK  would  be  a  proportionate
    interference with his Article 8 human rights.

78.   We dismiss the appellant's appeal on the only  grounds  which  he  has
    pursued that is the Article 8 human rights grounds.

        Dated      18 July 2013
