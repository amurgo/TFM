               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

For the Respondent:    Mr Tom Wilding, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                       DECISION OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
             PURSUANT TO RULE 40(3)(a) OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE
                         (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

 1. The appellant appeals with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the  respondent's  decision
    on 7 February 2018 to refuse to revoke a  decision  to  deport  him  to
    Somalia, of which he is a citizen, and to refuse him leave to remain on
    human rights grounds.  The appellant's home area is Somaliland.

 2. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  to  both  the  appellant  and  the
    respondent.

 3. At the hearing today, it was common ground that the First-tier Tribunal
    did materially err in law,  inter  alia  by  conflating  the  test  for
    'foreign  criminal'  at  section  117D(c)(ii)  with  that  at   section
    117D(c)(iii), leading to  a  finding  that  the  appellant  was  not  a
    persistent offender.  Mr Burrett accepted that if those provisions  are
    disjunctive and no seriousness test applies when  assessing  whether  a
    person is a persistent  offender,  then  on  the  appellant's  criminal
    history, he is a persistent offender.

 4. The parties agree that this is a case where the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal must be set  aside,  and  that  no  written  reasons  are
    required.  Pursuant to rule 40(3)  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008, no reasons (or further reasons) are required, the
    decision being made with the consent of the  parties  and  the  parties
    having given their consent to the Upper  Tribunal  not  giving  written
    reasons.

 5. We therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, with no
    findings of fact or credibility preserved. The appeal will now  proceed
    to the stage in which the First-tier Tribunal will  remake  afresh  the
    decision to allow or dismiss the appeal on the basis described  in  the
    grants of permission.
