                                   Between

               THE Secretary of State FOR THE Home Department
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                 SEBINA [S]

                                    [M R]
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                 Respondents


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Walker, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr I Khan, Counsel instructed by Raiyad Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Sweet who allowed the appellant's appeal and that of her  two  children
    on human rights grounds following their refusal  to  be  granted  entry
    clearance for leave to remain in the UK under the Immigration Rules,  a
    decision made on 22nd February 2016.  The  claimants  were  refused  on
    financial grounds.

 2. The judge wrote as follows:

         "At the time of the application her husband was employed  by  Total
         Food but his earnings were limited to  �9,315.   This  was  on  the
         basis that he was working part-time, but I am  now  satisfied  that
         his annual income is �21,133 for the tax year 2016/2017  and  these
         revised full-time earnings were indeed notified to  the  respondent
         on 25th August 2016, albeit before the end of that  tax  year.   In
         addition, the appellant's husband has undertaken part-time earnings
         with Wormley Takeaway and his earnings for the year 2016/2017  were
         �8,985.

         I accept that these enhanced earnings postdate the decision of  the
         respondent of 22nd February 2016, but  the  occupation  with  Total
         Food is the same as at the time of the application, but is now full-
         time and therefore at enhanced earnings.  It seems to me  therefore
         that the appellant can meet the requirements of Appendix FM of  the
         Immigration Rules  in  respect  of  the  required  earnings,  being
         �18,600 for the first appellant, �3,800 for the  first  child,  and
         �2,400 for the second child.  The required  earnings  were  �24,800
         and his earnings are now approximately �30,000.  For these reasons,
         I would allow the appeals.

         In the alternative, if I had not allowed the appeals under Appendix
         FM, taking into account that the appellant's husband is  a  British
         citizen and their third child, [I], was born in the UK on 23rd  May
         2016 and would therefore be granted British  citizenship,  I  would
         have allowed the appeals outside the Immigration Rules  because  in
         my view it would be disproportionate for the appellants to  make  a
         fresh application, taking into account  the  time  and  expense  of
         doing so".

 3. On that basis he allowed the appeal.

 4. The Secretary of State sought permission to  appeal  on  the  following
    grounds:

         "At [17] of the determination  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         finds that the financial requirements of Appendix FM and  FMSE  are
         satisfied on the basis of the sponsor's current earnings.

         However, the Rules require that the  evidence  relied  on  must  be
         evidence from the six months prior to the date of application.

         It is submitted that the judge  has  misdirected  himself  on  that
         basis.

         It is accepted that the third child,  born  in  2016  is  likely  a
         British citizen and that the appellant will be  successful  outside
         the Rules on that basis".

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Hollingworth on 24th  January
    2018.

Findings and conclusions

 6. At the hearing Mr Khan accepted that at the date of the application the
    sponsor did not earn sufficient money to reach the  required  financial
    threshold.  He made the rather novel argument that since he had in fact
    provided pay slips covering the period of six months prior to the  date
    of application, even though those pay slips would have  shown  that  he
    could  not  meet  the  threshold,  that  was  sufficient  to  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM/SE.

 7. Mr Walker asked me to find that the judge had erred in law  in  respect
    of the Immigration Rules but accepted that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    position was that the appellant would succeed outside  the  Immigration
    Rules on Article 8 grounds and acknowledged that there was no challenge
    within the grounds to his finding in that respect.

 8. The judge erred in law  in  respect  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    determination is somewhat unclear but it is  accepted  by  the  sponsor
    that he could not meet the required financial threshold at the relevant
    date and did not provide pay slips showing that  he  earned  sufficient
    money for the period of six months prior to the  date  of  application.
    However, since it is not argued by the Secretary of State that there is
    no  error  of  law  in  the  judge  allowing  the  appeal  outside  the
    Immigration Rules on the basis that this is a  British   citizen  child
    whose father now can meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules,
    the decision on Article 8 grounds will stand.

Notice of Decision

The original judge erred in law.  His decision is set aside.  It is  re-made
as follows.  The  appellant's  appeal  is  dismissed  with  respect  to  the
Immigration Rules.  The appellant's appeal is allowed on Article 8  grounds.
 Given the very lengthy delays in this case  being  resolved,  a  period  of
over three years since they made the application, it is  to  be  hoped  that
entry clearance can be issued as soon as practicable.

No anonymity direction is made.
