                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant, a citizen of Bangladesh born on 13 July  1989,  appeals,
    with permission, against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
    A R Williams who in a determination promulgated on 3 May 2013 dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary  of  State
    made on 24 September to refuse to grant leave to remain  on  the  basis
    that the appellant's rights under the ECHR would be  infringed  by  his
    removal.

2.   The appellant had arrived in Britain with a work  visa  valid  until  9
    February 2005.  He overstayed and in July 2007 submitted an application
    for leave to remain outside the Immigration  Rules.   That  application
    was  refused  in  December  2007.   In  October  2010  the  Appellant's
    solicitors wrote to the Secretary of State stating that  they  had  not
    received any information as to the outcome of the application  made  in
    July 2007.  After further correspondence an  application  for  judicial
    review was lodged on behalf of the appellant.   In  February  2012  the
    application for judicial review was refused by the High Court as having
    no merit.

3.   The application for judicial review was renewed.  On 19th June 2012  it
    was withdrawn by consent on the Secretary of State agreeing to consider
    the Appellant's further  submissions  under  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.
    Having considered the representations made the application was  refused
    on 24th September 2012.

4.   The appellant had alleged in the application that he was  in  a  stable
    relationship with a Ms Monwara Yasmin Uddin who had  two  children  and
    that the relationship had endured since 2007.

5.   The application was refused by the Secretary of  State  with  reference
    to Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules which came  into  effect  on  9
    July 2012.  It  was  stated  that  there  was  no  credible,  objective
    evidence to show a genuine relationship.  It was not accepted that  the
    relationship was genuine and subsisting and that it had been subsisting
    since 2007.  It was stated that the ages of the children had  not  been
    provided and there was no evidence that the appellant had any  parental
    relationship with them.  The appellant's claimed partner had lived  her
    formative years in Bangladesh and there was no evidence that she  would
    suffer any hardship by having to return there.  It was stated that  the
    appellant did not qualify for leave to  remain  on  the  basis  of  his
    private life here because he had not lived in Britain for twenty years.

6.   The judge heard evidence from  the  appellant  who  said  that  he  was
    living with his cousin, Rohim Ahmed, and did not have to pay  and  rent
    and was provided with food.  He accepted that he  had  remained  as  an
    overstayer but said that he had met his fianc�e in November 2007.   She
    was divorced although she had no divorce  papers  because  her  Islamic
    marriage was not registered in the United Kingdom.  He has  stated  his
    fianc�e's mother had accepted him as well as her two sons,  the  eldest
    of whom was 20 and a university student.  The younger son was  aged  13
    and still missed his father  and  found  it  difficult  to  accept  the
    absence of his father in his life.

7.   The appellant stated that he wanted to avoid involving his  fianc�e  in
    his immigration troubles as that would lead to her family  finding  out
    about the relationship.  She had commitments in the United Kingdom.  He
    said that he had lived with her for three months at the end of 2011 and
    the beginning of 2012 while her father was in Bangladesh.

8.   The appellant said that he had worked in restaurants and grocery  shops
    and was an Indian curry chef and  a  skilled  butcher  because  he  had
    worked in a butcher's shop as well.  He said that he could not  provide
    a lot of photographs  because  he  was  not  in  the  habit  of  taking
    photographs at every opportunity.  He claimed that he saw  his  fianc�e
    every day and that she stayed over at weekends.  It was only her father
    that did not accept the relationship.

9.   The appellant's partner gave evidence, saying  that  she  had  met  the
    appellant in 2007 and there had come a time when she had wanted him  to
    be a permanent part of her life.  She said that she had taken  time  to
    make up  her  mind  about  the  appellant  as  she  was  weary  of  any
    relationship because of her past experiences.  She  said  that  in  the
    cultural and religious environment in which she  lived  and  socialised
    there were difficulties that a single mother would face  in  having  an
    affair with a man.  She knew nothing about Bangladesh.

10.  She stated that the appellant had told her that he had been "on a  list
    for asylum when first met him and not legal in the  country"  and  said
    that he had said that he had not heard about the asylum application.

11.  The judge noted the evidence of the appellant's cousin Rohim Ahmed  and
    letters of support claiming that the appellant was a law-abiding member
    of the community.

12.  He further noted submissions made and photocopies of photographs  which
    had been produced.

13.  He found that the appellant could not qualify under the Rules  relating
    to his rights under Article 8 of the ECHR.   However,  he  went  on  to
    consider the appellant's appeal under the Convention in the appropriate
    structured way.  He found that the appellant  had  a  private  life  in
    Britain  in  which  his  removal  to  Bangladesh  would  constitute  an
    interference, but found that that would be a proportionate interference
    with his rights.

14.  He set out the relevant  factors  in  paragraphs  30  onwards,  placing
    weight on Section 55 of the UK Border Act 2009.  In paragraph 36 of the
    determination he stated that it would always be open for the  appellant
    to apply for entry clearance at a later date provided he could  satisfy
    the relevant Immigration Rules.  He went on to say,  however,  that  he
    had considered the case of  Chikwamba  [2008]  UKHL  40  but  that  the
    appellant came no where near satisfying any  Immigration  Rule  and  he
    considered that any Article 8 argument was  extremely  weak.   He  made
    reference to having considered the judgment of the House  of  Lords  in
    Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39.

15.  The appellant appealed.  The grounds of appeal argued  that  the  judge
    had not followed the judgment in Beoku-Betts and considered the  rights
    of the other members of the appellant's  family  and  argued  that  the
    judge had failed to treat "the partner of the appellant as a  'victim'"
    [para 43] Beoku Betts.  It was stated that  the  judge  had  failed  to
    address the test for the appellant's partner.

16.  Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Sommerville  granted  permission  to
    appeal, stating that the  First-tier  Judge  had  failed  to  make  any
    adequate  findings  to  the  nature  and  extent  of  the   appellant's
    relationship with his fianc�e and failed to assess the impact on her of
    his removal.

17.  At the hearing of the appeal before me  Mr  Syed-Ali  referred  to  the
    grounds of appeal and to a detailed  skeleton  argument  which  he  had
    submitted.  The skeleton argument contained submissions  regarding  the
    changes to the Immigration Rules and  also  to  an  argument  that  the
    appellant might have been entitled to  leave  to  remain  under  legacy
    provisions.  Mr Syed-Ali confirmed that he was not arguing  that  there
    was any error of law in relation to either of these matters.   He  also
    confirmed that he would make no submissions that  the  requirements  of
    Section 55 of the UK Borders Act 2009 had been ignored.

18.   Mr  Syed-Ali  emphasised,  however,  that  he  would  argue  that  the
    Immigration Judge had erred in his consideration of the proportionality
    of the removal of the appellant.  He  pointed  to  the  fact  that  the
    Immigration Judge had referred, in paragraph 28, that the  interference
    with the appellant's rights to private and family life would have grave
    consequences if he  were  removed.   He  stated  that  the  appellant's
    partner had give live  evidence  and  referred  to  the  fact  that  in
    paragraph 31 of the determination the Immigration Judge had referred to
    the issue of "insurmountable obstacles being in the  way  of  a  family
    living in the country of origin".

19.   He  submitted  that  the  assessment  of  the  Immigration  Judge  was
    insufficient and that he had not at all  considered  all  the  effected
    family members which was a duty placed upon him by the judgment of  the
    House of Lords in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39.

20.  Mr Nath argued that the Immigration Judge had properly  considered  all
    relevant matters and reached conclusions which were fully open  to  him
    on the evidence.

21.  I have considered the determination in some  detail.   The  reality  is
    that the Immigration Judge dealt with the issue of the  rights  of  the
    appellant under Article 8 of the ECHR both with reference  to  Appendix
    FM of the Rules - it is not contended that  the  appellant  could  have
    succeeded under the "new Rules" - but also under the Convention.  In so
    doing he applied the  relevant  structured  approach  set  out  in  the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  He had noted
    in some detail the evidence given to him by both the appellant  and  Ms
    Monwara Yasmin Uddin, the appellant's partner.

22.  In paragraphs 11  onwards  he  referred  to  the  appellant's  evidence
    regarding his relationship with Ms Uddin, which included the fact  that
    she  had  no  divorce  paper  because  her  Islamic  marriage  was  not
    registered, that her eldest son was aged 20 and  a  university  student
    who kept his opinions to himself, and that there was a younger  son  of
    13 who missed his father and found it difficult to accept  the  absence
    of his father in his life.

23.  The appellant had stated that he  had  wanted  to  avoid  involving  Ms
    Uddin in his immigration troubles and that he had lived  with  her  for
    three months at the end of 2011 and the  beginning  of  2012  when  her
    father was in Bangladesh.

24.  He noted the evidence from Ms Uddin which I have set out above, and  in
    particular that although she  saw  the  appellant  every  day,  at  the
    weekends she had told her parents that she was with a friend.

25.  In paragraphs 24 onwards the judge assessed the  evidence  before  him,
    noting that the appellant did not live with Ms Uddin  because  of  "the
    distain relating to the  relationship  with  Ms  Uddin's  father".   He
    concluded that there seemed to be no immediate prospect, if  any,  that
    Ms Uddin and the appellant would live together as husband and wife.  He
    did, however, accept that family life existed.

26.  He pointed out that the mere existence of  a  family  relationship  was
    not sufficient for the applicability of Article 8, but  did  go  on  to
    conclude that the interference with the appellant's private and  family
    life would have grave consequences if he were removed.

27.  It was in those  circumstances  that  he  moved  on  to  the  issue  of
    proportionality.

28.  He properly analysed the relevant  factors,  including  the  length  of
    time the appellant had been in Britain, but pointed out that  that  had
    been largely on an unlawful basis.  He correctly directed himself  that
    he must strike a fair balance between the competing  interests  of  the
    individual and the community as a  whole  and  that  there  was  not  a
    general obligation for any state to respect an  immigrant's  choice  of
    country of residence.  He stated that factors to be taken into  account
    were the extent to which family  life  was  effectively  ruptured,  the
    extent of the  ties  in  the  contracting  state,  whether  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles in the way of family living in the country  of
    origin, and whether there were factors of immigration control  such  as
    history of breaches of immigration control or considerations of  public
    policy weighing in favour of exclusion.

29.  At this stage I would point out that  although  the  Immigration  Judge
    referred to the issue of "insurmountable obstacles",  the  reality  was
    that he was only stating that that was one factor that should be  taken
    into consideration when considering whether or not  the  rights  of  an
    appellant under Article 8 would be infringed by removal.

30.  He went on to state that an important consideration  would  be  whether
    family life had been created at the time when the persons involved were
    aware that the immigration status of one of  them  was  such  that  the
    present of that family life without the home state would be precarious.

31.  In paragraph 33 he stated that he had to bear  in  mind  the  appellant
    came nowhere near satisfying the Immigration Rules, and that the  Rules
    were a relevant consideration.  I  consider  that  he  was  correct  to
    consider that that was a relevant factor.

32.  He went on to say that even if family life were accepted there  was  no
    evidence of finance before the Tribunal and it  was  obvious  that  the
    appellant  came  nowhere   near   satisfying   the   English   language
    requirement, and it was relevant that the appellant had been in  breach
    of immigration law and control.  He pointed out the appellant had  ties
    with his home country.

33.  He referred  to  the  issue  of  the  appellant's  fianc�e's  children,
    pointing out that one was  aged  20.   He  stated  that  it  was  quite
    obvious, looking at all the facts of the case, that it could  never  be
    said that it would be disproportionate for the appellant to be  removed
    to his home country.

34.  He did go on to say that it would be open to  the  appellant  to  apply
    for entry clearance at a  later  date  if  he  satisfied  the  relevant
    Immigration Rules.

35.  He concluded by saying that "any Article 8  argument  is,  so  I  find,
    extremely weak".

36.  It is of note that  the  judge  did  not  in  his  conclusions  to  the
    determination refer to the appellant's relationship with Ms  Uddin  but
    the reality is that when he reached his conclusion he must  have  taken
    into account the conclusions which he reached in paragraphs 25  and  26
    of the determination where he had found that the appellant did not live
    with Ms Uddin and that it was said that they could  not  live  together
    because of the disdain relating to the  relationship  from  Ms  Uddin's
    father, and that there appeared to be no immediate prospect  that  they
    would live together as husband and wife.

37.  These are clearly relevant factors.  I note of course  that  the  judge
    in  paragraph  25  stated  that  it  was  "for  the  purposes  of  this
    determination" that he was willing to accept that family life  existed.
    The reality is that it was relevant for him to consider in some  detail
    all aspects of the appellant's family and private life and he would  be
    aware that relevant case law means that the threshold for finding  that
    Article 8 is engaged is low, and that in most circumstances  where  the
    issue of Article 8 is argued it is appropriate to note that there is  a
    low threshold for the engagement of that Article and to go  on  to  the
    other Razgar  questions  and  deal  properly  with  the  issue  of  the
    proportionality of removal.

38.  In this case the Immigration Judge had found that the appellant and  Ms
    Uddin were not living as husband and wife and there was no prospect  of
    their doing so - Ms Uddin's father was not aware of  the  relationship.
    He also found that there was no evidence to suggest that the  appellant
    had any relationship with the children of Ms Uddin.

39.  Taking these factors into consideration I  consider  that  although  it
    might have been preferable for the Immigration Judge to have reiterated
    his conclusions regarding the appellant's relationship with Ms Uddin at
    the end of the determination just before his conclusions, there was  no
    material error of law in his not doing so,  and  that  his  conclusions
    were fully open to him.  He clearly did take into account the effect of
    the separation on Ms Uddin when he stated  at  paragraph  28  that  the
    interference would have grave consequences, but he was correct to place
    weight on other factors such as the appellant's immigration history and
    the fact that there was no prospect  of  Ms  Uddin  and  the  appellant
    living together as husband and wife before reaching his conclusions and
    indeed it is relevant that he refers to the case of Beoku-Betts  before
    dismissing the appeal.

40.  I therefore find that  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
    determination of the Immigration Judge and that his decision dismissing
    this appeal both under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights
    grounds shall stand.
