Representation:
For the claimant:            Not represented, except by sponsor Mr Abdollah
Daeisadeghi
For the respondent:       Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chambers  promulgated  28.10.14,  allowing
    the claimant's appeal against the decision  of  the  respondent,  dated
    21.1.14, to refuse the appellant entry clearance to the United  Kingdom
    for settlement as the spouse of the sponsor pursuant to paragraph  352A
    of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 15.10.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 2.3.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Chambers should be set aside.

 5. The sponsor has refugee status in  the  UK.  The  application  made  on
    10.9.13 was for family reunion of the claimant as a  pre-flight  family
    member of a refugee, pursuant to  paragraph  352A  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. This requires the applicant to  be  married  to  a  person  with
    current refugee granted status in the UK and the marriage must not have
    taken place after the refugee left the country of his  former  habitual
    residence in order to seek asylum.

 6. The sponsor was granted leave to remain as a refugee on 23.1.13.  It is
    claimed that he entered into a Sigheh, or temporary marriage, with  the
    claimant on 1.5.10. On  22.8.13  the  claimant  and  the  sponsor  were
    married by proxy in Iran,  over  the  telephone.  The  application  was
    refused because the claimant married the sponsor after he  was  granted
    his refugee status.

 7. In essence, the grounds of  appeal  assert  that  the  judge  erred  in
    finding that the temporary marriage of the  claimant  and  the  sponsor
    could be regarded as a valid marriage.

 8. It is also submitted that as by the time of  the  second  marriage  the
    sponsor was settled and domiciled in the UK, he had no  legal  capacity
    to enter into a proxy marriage, an issue not considered by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge, except at �16 and �17 when considering whether the
    second marriage was valid, finding that although the sponsor is  living
    in the UK he was entitled to enter into a proxy marriage and  that  his
    residence in the UK did  not  affect  his  capacity  to  enter  into  a
    marriage. However, �17 contains an error of law, as  contrary  to  that
    stated by the judge, neither a British citizen nor a person settled  in
    the UK may enter into a proxy marriage,  as  proxy  marriages  are  not
    recognised as a valid form of marriage in the UK.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Fisher found an arguable  error
    of law in the failure of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to  make  any
    finding on the sponsor's domicile at the point of the second  marriage.
    However, it was the first, temporary, marriage which  the  judge  found
    met the requirements of the Rules. As the judge explained at  �18,  the
    second marriage does not assist the claimant, as it  was  entered  into
    after the sponsor left Iran in order to claim asylum.

10. I find that the judge  was  in  error  to  find  the  first,  temporary
    marriage, valid for the purpose of  352A.  The  judge  referred  to  LS
    (Mut'a or Sighe) Iran  [2007] UK AIT  00072,  in  which  the   headnote
    states that: "the Islamic institution of  mut'a  or  sigh?  is  in  its
    essence neither permanent nor exclusive.  It is not marriage within the
    meaning of the Immigration Rules, and its existence does  not  imply  a
    relationship  continuing   or   intended   to   continue   beyond   its
    termination."

11. Judge Chambers correctly pointed out at �19 that the Tribunal  did  not
    hold as the headnote suggests, as the Tribunal was not asked to  decide
    that issue. However, it did state as follows:

         18.                  "A further question raised  on  the  facts  of
         this case is whether a mut'a is capable  of  being  regarded  as  a
         marriage for the purposes of the Immigration Rules.  This issue was
         not conceded by the respondent, who conceded merely that  temporary
         marriage was legal  in  Iran.   As  we  have  said,  mut'a  is  not
         recognised  by  the   vast   majority   of   Islamic   schools   of
         jurisprudence.   It  has   two   features   that   distinguish   it
         particularly  from  marriage  as  understood  in   most   cultures,
         including both those of Western  Europe  and  those  of  the  Sunni
         division of Islam.   One  is  that  it  is  by  nature  essentially
         temporary: it is not of the nature of  mut'a  to  be  dissolved  by
         death  (although  death  during  the   term   does   dissolve   the
         relationship); the characteristic of mut'a is that it is terminated
         by mere effluxion of time.  Secondly, the relationship between  the
         man and the woman in mut'a is, so far as the man is concerned,  not
         exclusive.  His being a party to mut'a has no effect on his ability
         to contract another similar arrangement with another woman,  or  to
         become a party to a nikah or regular marriage.  As is  well  known,
         the classic Islamic rules restrict a man to four wives.   There  is
         no doubt that women with whom he has the contract of mut'a  do  not
         count towards the four.

         19. Notions of marriage naturally vary between cultures, but we  do
         not  think  that  it  would  be  wrong  to  regard  permanence  and
         exclusivity as essential features of the institution.  Both may  be
         subject to  variable  understanding  or  even  undermining.   Rules
         allowing restricted polygamy, and  rules  permitting  divorce,  are
         found in many societies.  But it  does  not  seem  to  us  that  an
         institution which by its nature is neither permanent  or  exclusive
         can properly be regarded as marriage.  If we had had to decide  the
         issue, therefore, we should have further held  that  mut'a  is  not
         marriage for the purposes of the Immigration Rules."

12. Finally, at �21 the Upper Tribunal very firmly stated: "In  any  event,
    however, there was no basis upon which  he  could  have  found  in  the
    appellant's favour that the second contract was validly entered into by
    telephone  from  Turkey,  and,  further,  in  our  view  mut'a  is  not
    "marriage" for the purpose of the Immigration Rules in any event."

13. In attempting to distinguish LS the First-tier Tribunal Judge  referred
    to the fact that the situation in LS was of  two  successive  temporary
    marriages, but that distinction does  not  get  round  the  very  clear
    statement of the Upper Tribunal  panel  in  LS  that  mut'a  is  not  a
    marriage for the purpose of the Immigration Rules,  as  it  is  neither
    permanent nor exclusive and thus  cannot  properly  be  regarded  as  a
    marriage.  Further, the Upper Tribunal also pointed out at �12 of  that
    decision that no evidence had been adduced as  to  the  validity  of  a
    temporary marriage. I also note that  in  his  interview,  the  sponsor
    described the claimant as his fianc�e and has also described his status
    as single in both the  screening  and  substantive  asylum  interviews.
    There was, therefore, no basis in evidence or  law  for  the  judge  to
    reach the conclusion that the temporary  marriage  was  valid  for  the
    purposes of paragraph 352A.

14. In the circumstances, the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  doomed
    to failure; it could not and  should  not  have  succeeded.  The  first
    marriage was not a marriage for the purpose of  the  Immigration  Rules
    Whether or not the second marriage was valid in UK law, which  is  most
    doubtful, was irrelevant as it was entered into after the sponsor  fled
    Iran.

15. On the basis that the claimant and the sponsor are not married and  not
    in a relationship akin to marriage there is no family life between them
    capable of engaging article 8 either under  the  Immigration  Rules  or
    outside the Rules on the basis of article  8  ECHR.  The  claimant  was
    given  two  opportunities  to  apply  under  the  correct   immigration
    category, but declined to do so. There is a route for entry  under  the
    Immigration Rules, which the claimant has not pursued.

16. The sponsor told me that it is sad for him not to be able  to  see  his
    'wife.' He also pointed out that they lived together for a   period  of
    time in the same household as his parents. He has only been able to see
    the claimant by visiting her in Turkey. He insisted that both marriages
    were valid.

17. In the circumstances of this case, even if their circumstances  engaged
    article 8, it would be difficult to  conclude  that  the  decision  was
    disproportionate. They are free to continue such relationship  as  they
    have with each other in the circumstances in which the relationship was
    founded by the proxy marriage, visit each other in third countries,  or
    to make an application that meets the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules. There is therefore no prospect whatsoever that the appeal  could
    be allowed on the basis of human rights.

Conclusion & Decision:

18. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                                          I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee  Award                              Note:  this  is  not   part   of the
determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of the claimant has been dismissed and  thus  there  can
be no fee award.
