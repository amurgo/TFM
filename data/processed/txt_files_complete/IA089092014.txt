Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms S Shaikh, instructed by SH & Co Solicitors
For the respondent:    Ms C Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Hazret Kose, date of birth  20.6.87,  is  a  citizen  of
    Turkey.

 2. This is his appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Graham, who dismissed his appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent, dated 20.1.14 to refuse his application under  the  Turkey-
    European Community Association Agreement 1973 (the  Agreement)  and  to
    remove him from the UK by way of directions under  section  47  of  the
    Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The Judge heard the appeal
    on 25.4.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Page refused permission to appeal on  6.6.14,
    but when renewed to the  Upper  Tribunal,  permission  was  granted  on
    29.7.14

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 24.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Graham should be set aside.

The Agreement

 6. In granting permission to appeal the Upper Tribunal Judge (who did  not
    provide a name, only a  squiggle)  stated  that  there  was  little  to
    criticise in relation to the Agreement but as article 8 was raised as a
    ground of appeal and in the light of the  pending  removal,  it  should
    have been dealt with by the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 7. It appears to me that the grant of permission is limited to  article  8
    ECHR only. However,  I  permitted  Ms  Shaikh  to  address  me  on  the
    Agreement issues.

 8. I find that the judge  properly  considered  the  correct  approach  to
    paragraph 21 of the 1972 Immigration Rules, following the  guidance  in
    Akinci (paragraph 21 UC 510 - correct approach) [2012] UKUT 266, and in
    particular that the appellant's part in the business must not amount to
    disguised employment.

 9. The judge did not rely on the Secretary of State's concerns about a  UK
    driving licence or the  lack  of  a  vehicle.  Neither  did  the  judge
    consider it necessary for the appellant to demonstrate understanding of
    business software.

10. However, between  �12  and  �14  the  judge  analysed  the  appellant's
    business plan and his evidence. The judge pointed out that at the  rate
    he proposed and the number of deliveries he would have to make  a  day,
    working 6-7 hours, the gross return of �40 a  day  was  less  than  the
    minimum wage. Once the overheads were taken into account the judge  was
    not satisfied that the income would be sufficient to support him in the
    UK.

11. The judge  also  found  the  working  arrangements  not  credible,  the
    appellant being unable to explain how,  if  he  only  worked  for  each
    business customer one day a week, they would arrange for food  delivery
    on the other days when he was not working. At �14 the judge said, "..it
    made no sense for a takeaway to employ the appellant at this rate  when
    they could employ someone and pay the same employee  roughly  the  same
    rate to work every day of the week." Hence, the judge  arrived  at  the
    conclusion in  �15  that  the  business  plan  was  in  fact  disguised
    employment. In the preceding paragraphs as well as  in  �15  the  judge
    indicated what he had taken into account and his reasons  for  reaching
    that conclusion.

12. Whilst I accept that  there  is  no  requirement  in  paragraph  21  to
    demonstrate that  an  applicant  must  earn  above  minimum  wage,  the
    considerations made by the First-tier  Tribunal  in  relation  to  this
    issue are certainly highly relevant  as  to  whether  this  is  genuine
    business or in fact disguised employment.  It  is  submitted  that  the
    business plan shows a net profit of �1,048 per month. That may  be  so,
    but the judge is entitled to place reliance  on  the  appellant's  oral
    evidence as to how  the  business  would  work  and  how  he  would  be
    remunerated. It is also submitted that  as  the  appellant  is  single,
    lives with his parents, and has no major living expenses, his  business
    will be sufficient to support him. Again,  the  judge  is  entitled  to
    consider the evidence as a whole, which the judge indicated he had done
    before reaching his findings and conclusions.

13. The Rule 24 response is to the  effect  that  the  Secretary  of  State
    considers that the Judge has properly  dealt  with  the  issue  of  the
    appellant's employment and the findings are clearly sustainable on  the
    evidence. I agree. The grounds of appeal on this  issue  amount  to  no
    more than a disagreement with  the  judge's  findings  and  conclusions
    there from, which the judge was entitled to reach and for which  cogent
    reasons have been given. The judge  reached  the  conclusion  that  the
    business plan was in  fact  disguised  employment.  The  appellant  had
    proposed in a rather non-credible way a business providing  a  takeaway
    delivery service for customers at �1.50 a time, regardless of  distance
    or time of delivery. I agree with Judge Page that it  would  have  been
    surprising if the judge had reached  any  other  conclusion  given  the
    evidence relied on by the appellant.

14. It is not incumbent on the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  to  recite  or
    summarise all the evidence. He has stated that he  has  taken  it  into
    account and there is, in my view, nothing to suggest that had  he  made
    specified reference to the alleged omitted evidence the outcome of this
    aspect of the appeal would be any different.

15. In the circumstances, and for the reasons stated, I find no error or no
    material error of law in  the  judge's  findings  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's business plan and the Agreement.

Article 8

16. In relation to article 8 when granting permission to appeal  the  Upper
    Tribunal Judge stated, "... the grounds of appeal  on  this  topic  are
    confined to one paragraph. Indeed the skeleton  argument  makes  but  a
    passing reference to this aspect. There is a paucity of evidence on the
    aspect of private or family life despite the invitation made under  the
    one stop warning notice in the  decision  of  19.12.13  to  submit  all
    evidence that was relied upon. It was said in  the  grounds  of  appeal
    submitted that there would be  elaboration  with  documentary  evidence
    before the appeal hearing.  In  the  event,  there  was  a  paucity  of
    evidence submitted.

17. "With some reluctance I grant permission because it  is  arguable  that
    had the Judge in fact considered the evidence there was little to go on
    and thus his  error  was  not  material.  The  burden  rests  upon  the
    appellant and his representatives to adduce all  relevant  evidence  to
    deal with the issues under Article 8 and paragraph 276ADE. Whether such
    evidence should be regarded as post decision evidence will also  be  an
    issue to be addressed at the hearing."

18. In respect of  article  8,  the  Rule  24  response  stated,  "...  the
    Secretary  of  State  notes  that  there  is  no  indication   in   the
    determination that this was pursued before the Judge and she would draw
    the attention of the Tribunal to the comments of  Lord  Justice  Moore-
    Bick in Para 20 of Sarkar v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2014] EWCA Civ 195:

         "Finally, I think it is important to bear in mind that  this  court
         will allow an appeal against a decision of the Upper Tribunal  only
         if it is satisfied that it involved a material error  of  law.  The
         most that can be said of the decision in the present case  is  that
         the Tribunal failed to  consider  the  merits  of  the  appellants'
         article 8 claim. However, there was no evidence before the Tribunal
         capable of support the findings of fact necessary to  enable  their
         argument to succeed. I find it difficult to see, therefore, how  it
         can be said that any such error was material since, if the Tribunal
         had considered that ground of appeal, it would have been  bound  to
         reject it."

19. The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in the present  appeal
    stated only that the appellant had his immediate family members who are
    all settled in the UK. "It is  submitted  that  our  client  should  be
    allowed to remain in the UK under the  current  immigration  Rules  and
    also Article  8.  It  is  submitted  that  the  above  points  will  be
    elaborated  with  documentary  evidence  before  our  client's   appeal
    hearing." Apparently there  was  no  such  elaboration  by  documentary
    evidence.

20. The grounds of application for permission to appeal  contend  that  the
    judge failed to make any findings in relation to an article 8 claim  to
    remain in the UK on the basis of article 8 ECHR and  paragraph  276ADE,
    despite being raised  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and in the skeleton argument. The grounds, both to the  First-
    tier Tribunal and to the Upper Tribunal, did no  more  than  raise  the
    issue and made no substantive submissions. The issue  appears  only  at
    �16 of the skeleton argument, at the very end. There  it  is  suggested
    that the appellant meets the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE,  but
    given that he has not lived in the UK for a period of 20  years  it  is
    difficult to see  how  he  could  demonstrate  that  he  has  no  ties,
    including social, cultural and family with Turkey. He had only lived in
    the UK for 2 years and 8 months at  the  date  of  his  application  in
    August 2013. He lives with his parents, who are settled in the  UK  and
    his brother is a  British  citizen.  It  was  submitted  that  all  his
    immediate family members live in  the  UK,  but  I  note  that  in  his
    application at Q7.12 he stated that he had siblings living  in  Turkey.
    In any event, the fact that other family members have indefinite  leave
    to remain is not a qualification of entitlement to this appellant being
    able to reside in the UK indefinitely.

21. In the circumstances, on the limited evidence available, I  cannot  see
    how the appellant qualifies under paragraph 276ADE of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Thus there can be no error of law in  failing  to  address  that
    provision in the determination.

22. Although it is briefly raised at the very end of the skeleton argument,
    I have seen no evidence that article 8 was  addressed  at  all  by  the
    appellant's representative at the First-tier Tribunal  appeal  hearing.
    Before me, Ms Shaikh seeks to  rely  on  alleged  emotional  dependency
    between the appellant and his family members in the UK,  including  his
    parents with whom he lives. As far as I  can  tell  this  is  an  issue
    raised for the first time before the Upper Tribunal and not  raised  at
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing.  I  also  note   that   the
    appellant's witness statement makes no reference to any such  emotional
    dependency, neither does that of his father. In  fact  the  appellant's
    witness statement raises no article 8 private or family life  issue  at
    all. Having considered the whole of the  appellant's  bundle  there  is
    nothing in there at all that in any way addresses article 8 private and
    family life. It is clear that the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal
    was placed entirely on the basis of  the  Agreement  and  his  business
    plan.

23. In the circumstances, I find that the Secretary of State is correct  to
    point to Sarkar. Whilst the issue  of  article  8  was  raised  in  the
    briefest of vague terms, there was no evidence placed before the First-
    tier Tribunal capable of supporting any  finding  that  there  was  any
    family life between the appellant and his parents or any  adult  family
    members other than the normal emotional  ties  that  one  would  expect
    between such adult relatives. There is no evidence of any emotional  or
    other significant dependency  such  as  to  support  an  argument  that
    article 8 is engaged. I find that  the  appellant's  representative  is
    now, at this late  stage,  trying  to  create  such  an  argument,  not
    previously advanced and trying to take tactical advantage of  the  fact
    that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  address  article  8  in  the
    determination.

24. Having  heard  and  carefully  considered  all  the  evidence  and  the
    submissions of the parties, I am satisfied that even  if  it  had  been
    expressly considered, it is undoubtedly the case  that  any  article  8
    claim of the appellant could not have succeeded. If it had been raised,
    which I do not accept it was, the Tribunal would  have  been  bound  to
    reject the claim and additionally  dismiss  the  appeal  on  article  8
    private and family life grounds. He came here as a student with limited
    leave to remain until 28.8.13. He  had  no  legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to remain except in accordance with the  Immigration  Rules.
    No evidence has been provided as to whether he actually  undertook  any
    studies in the UK. Even now, there is absolutely nothing upon which  to
    found  a  claim  that  the  removal  decision  could  be  regarded   as
    unjustifiably harsh or disproportionate.

Conclusion & Decision

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
