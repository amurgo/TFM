For the Appellants: Mr Adewole (Solicitor)
For the Respondent: Mr Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Appellants' appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Afako promulgated on the 8th October 2015, in which she
      dismissed  the  Appellants'  appeals  under  the   Immigration   (EEA)
      Regulations 2006.

   2. The Appellants have sought to appeal against  that  decision  for  the
      reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  This  is  a  matter  of
      record and is set out in detail there, and therefore is  not  repeated
      in full here.

   3. Permission to appeal has been granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Hollingworth on the 1st April 2016, in which  he  found  that  it  was
      arguable that in light of  the  extent  of  the  documentary  evidence
      available and the evidence presented at the hearing in relation to the
      standard and burden of proof, that the Judge had  referred  to  unduly
      high expectations as  to  the  extent  of  the  evidence  required  to
      discharge the burden of proof according to the requisite  standard  in
      the circumstances of the case.  He further found that  the  Judge  had
      not dealt with the question of  the  weight  to  be  attached  to  the
      payment of tax by the Appellant's former husband in  relation  to  the
      method of self-assessment with particular reference  to  the  earnings
      going beyond the date of  the  dissolution  of  the  marriage  in  the
      circumstances of the case.  He further stated that at paragraph 14  of
      the decision the Judge had accepted that in respect of whether or  not
      the Appellant had been economically active since  the  dissolution  of
      the marriage that there was material from  HMRC  issued  in  September
      2015 which showed that the Appellant had made tax returns and payments
      of National Insurance over a number of years, but the Judge had stated
      this was not in itself sufficient  to  establish  that  she  had  been
      economically active  as  declared  and  that  the  Judge  went  on  at
      paragraph 14 to state  that  the  information  did  not  describe  the
      economic activity "and since in the most case no tax was paid, and  no
      accountant seems to  have  been  employed,  there  is  no  independent
      verification  that  the  Appellant  was  in  fact  working.".    Judge
      Hollingworth concluded that it was arguable that the Judge had imposed
      too high  a  threshold  in  relation  to  the  standard  of  proof  in
      considering the  documentary  evidence  which  had  been  provided  in
      conjunction with the oral evidence which had been furnished.

   4. Mr Adewole on behalf  of  the  Appellants  relied  upon  his  Skeleton
      Argument.  He did however concede the argument that  had  been  raised
      within the Grounds of Appeal that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  was
      wrong in failing to consider the Appellants' Article  8  Human  Rights
      claim, in light  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  the  case  of
      Amirteymour and others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]  UKUT  466.
      However he argued that the  Judge  had  put  too  high  an  evidential
      threshold on the Appellants and that HM Revenue and  Customs  evidence
      had been presented, both in respect of the EEA Sponsor  and  also  the
      Appellant which had not been disputed by the  Respondent.   He  argued
      that the Judge was  only  considering  the  case  on  the  balance  of
      probabilities and that there was documentary evidence to confirm  that
      the marriage had been dissolved.  He argued that the wife and children
      would have been granted a previous residence card and had  retained  a
      right of residence  under  Regulation  10  of  the  Immigration  (EEA)
      Regulations 2006.  He argued  that  the  tax  documentation  had  been
      accepted as genuine.  He further argued that since the dissolution  of
      the marriage the Appellant Mrs Otubanjo  had  been  exercising  treaty
      rights  and  was  registered  as  self-employed  and  was  paying  tax
      regularly.  He argued that she had been registered as a  child  minder
      and that the tax returns and National Insurance contributions had  not
      been disputed and that the  Judge  was  wrong  to  conclude  that  the
      Appellant Mrs Otubanjo did not meet  the  requirements  of  Regulation
      10(6) of the Regulations.

   5. In his submissions on behalf of the Respondent Mr  Tufan  argued  that
      the Judge had considered the documents  relating  to  the  Sponsor  Mr
      Mykolaitis' tax records from HMRC to show that the former  spouse  had
      been self-employed but had not earned enough to pay tax and that  this
      did include a tax return for  the  year  ending  April  2014  and  tax
      returns between 2009/2010 and 2014/2015.  He argued that the final tax
      return did show that zero tax was  paid,  but  conceded  that  it  did
      declare earnings of �7,650.  Mr Tufan  conceded  that  simply  because
      someone was earning below the threshold to pay tax did not  mean  that
      they were not in  fact  working,  taking  into  account  the  personal
      allowance.  However, he conceded that there was an  error  of  law  in
      respect of the Judge's findings at paragraph [10] of the Judgement, in
      that the Judge had failed to adequately explain why it  was  that  the
      Appellant's evidence regarding her former spouse working at a car wash
      and having provided copies  of  his  tax  returns  from  2009  onwards
      including up to and beyond the date of the dissolution of the marriage
      was insufficient to show that he was in fact exercising treaty rights.
       The Judge at [10] had indicated that the  Appellant  stated  that  Mr
      Mykolaitis worked at a car wash, but it was unclear  where  that  was,
      but that there was no explanation given as to why the precise location
      of the car wash would need  to  be  provided,  if  evidence  had  been
      produced that he was  exercising  treaty  rights  as  a  self-employed
      person.  Further the Judge indicated that  "There  has  not  been  any
      evidence from mutual friends to attest that  they  knew  him  and  his
      economic activities".  Again, it was conceded that it was unclear from
      the Judge's reasonings as to why there would need to be evidence  from
      mutual friends in respect of a Sponsor's activities within the UK.

   6. However, he initially argued that any error in  that  regard  was  not
      material, given that the Judge had concerns regarding whether  or  not
      the Appellant herself was economically active since the dissolution of
      the marriage and raised concerns regarding the fact  that  within  her
      bank statement there are payments to and from ABBS Catering which  was
      said to be "pay" whereas the Appellant  said  that  she  was  a  child
      minder.  He said that this was a finding open to the  Judge,  but  did
      concede that there did appear to be a contradiction in respect of  the
      Judge's findings at [14] wherein she accepted that the  material  from
      HMRC was issued in September 2015 and showed the Appellants  had  made
      tax returns and payments of National Insurance over a number of  years
      but then found that this was not sufficient to establish that she  had
      been economically active as declared.  He then conceded that this  had
      not been adequately explained  and  that  the  explanation  that  "the
      information does not describe the economic activity and since  in  the
      most case no tax was paid,  and  no  accountant  seems  to  have  been
      employed, there is no independent verification that the Appellant  was
      in fact working", was somewhat unclear.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

   7. In respect of the first issue as to whether or not Mr Mykolaitis,  the
      EEA Sponsor was economically active in the UK, up to the date  of  the
      dissolution of the marriage on the  13th  June  2014,  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge clearly had before her evidence from HMRC in  terms  of
      tax returns for the period between 2009 and up to and including  April
      2015, with the final tax return showing  that  he  had  earned  �7,650
      between April 2014 and April 2015.  She noted that the Respondent  had
      received some of Mr Mykolaitis' tax records and had  not  demonstrated
      these to be unreliable and the Respondent would have issued him with a
      residence card at some point before  treating  the  Appellant  as  his
      spouse, but found that  this  was  not  evidence  that  Mr  Mykolaitis
      continued to exercise treaty  rights.   However,  at  [10]  the  Judge
      stated that missing from the appeal is:

       "additional evidence beyond the self-reported information that is  in
      the hands of the tax authorities.  It would appear that the  Appellant
      managed to obtain the latest returns for Mr Mykolaitis, but there  has
      been no other evidence, or explanation for  its  absence,  as  to  his
      actual economic activities.  The Appellant stated that  Mr  Mykolaitis
      worked at a car wash, but it was not clear where this was.  There  had
      not been any evidence from mutual friends to attest that they knew him
      and his economic activities.  All she said in evidence  was  that  she
      had spoken to him and he had asked her not to call him again.  If  the
      Appellant could secure a copy of his tax  returns,  it  is  surprising
      that she could not obtain further information about his  circumstances
      in  order  to  establish  his  status  in  the  country.   Given   the
      opportunity she had to adduce cogent corroboration, I am not  prepared
      to accept the Appellant's  bare  assertions  that  Mr  Mykolaitis  was
      indeed self-employed and thus exercising treaty rights at the time  of
      the dissolution of the marriage.".

   8. In my judgement, the First-tier Tribunal Judge, has however failed  to
      explain why the oral evidence of the Appellant in respect of  her  ex-
      husband working at a car wash, linked with the tax returns, which  had
      been submitted, were in themselves insufficient to establish that  her
      husband was economically active.  In this regard, the  fact  that  the
      husband may not have earned enough to pay tax, does not mean  that  he
      had not declared his earnings to HMRC, and there is no minimum  income
      requirement set out for this  purpose  within  the  Immigration  (EEA)
      Regulations  2006.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  seems  to  have
      required corroborative evidence in the form of  evidence  from  mutual
      friends to  attest  to  the  EEA  Sponsor's  economic  activities,  in
      addition to clear evidence as to exactly where this car wash was.   By
      seeming to indicate that evidence from mutual friends to  attest  that
      they knew the  Sponsor  and  his  economic  activities  was  important
      evidence that was missing, in my judgement First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Afako has imposed too high of an evidential burden on  the  Appellant.
      It is also clear that the Judge's comments at the end of [10] that  "I
      am not prepared to accept the  Appellant's  bare  assertions  that  Mr
      Mykolaitis was indeed self-employed and thus exercising treaty  rights
      at the time of the dissolution of the marriage", is wrong, given  that
      it was not simply a  bare  assertion  that  Mr  Mykolaitis  was  self-
      employed, the tax  returns  had  also  been  submitted.   The  Judge's
      reasoning as to why this  evidence  was  insufficient,  has  not  been
      clearly explained and is inadequate.

   9. In respect of the second question as to whether or not  the  Appellant
      herself was economically  active  following  the  dissolution  of  her
      marriage, although the First-tier Tribunal Judge noted the payments to
      and from ABBS Catering which on  occasions  was  stated  to  be  "pay"
      within the Appellant's bank statements, the Appellant Mrs Otubanjo had
      not herself sought to argue that that was the source  of  her  income,
      indeed her evidence was that she was a registered  child  minder.   In
      this regard she had  again  produced  evidence  from  HMRC  issued  in
      September 2015 which showed Mrs Otubanjo had completed  a  tax  return
      and payments of National Insurance over a  number  of  years,  but  as
      properly conceded by Mr Tufan on behalf of the Respondent,  the  Judge
      at [14] went on to state that "this of itself  is  not  sufficient  to
      establish she has indeed been economically  active  as  declared"  and
      that in that regard  that  statement  appears  to  be  somewhat  self-
      contradictory and in my judgment has not  been  adequately  explained.
      The Judge went on to state "The  information  does  not  describe  the
      economic activity and seems in the most case no tax was paid,  and  no
      accountant seems to  have  been  employed,  there  is  no  independent
      verification that the Appellant was in fact working." Most tax returns
      would not necessarily  describe  the  economic  activity  in  specific
      detail, and the Judge in  that  regard  did  have  evidence  from  the
      Appellant herself that she was a child minder.  Further, the fact that
      in most cases no tax was paid, does not mean that  the  Appellant  was
      not earning, if she was in fact declaring income  below  the  personal
      allowance threshold.  There was no requirement that the Appellant  Mrs
      Otubanjo was in fact  earning  income  over  and  above  the  personal
      allowance threshold.  Further, the Judge appears to  have  taken  into
      consideration the fact that no accountant seems to have been employed.
       However, again, there is no  requirement  for  an  accountant  to  be
      employed to check a self-employed person's account, and although  this
      may have been helpful evidence, it was not  a  necessity.   The  Judge
      appears to have required independent verification that  the  Appellant
      was in fact working, and has not  adequately  explained  why  her  own
      evidence and the evidence from HMRC was insufficient.

  10. I therefore do find that the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Afako does contain material errors of law, in terms  of  the  lack  of
      adequate reasoning regarding why the Appellant Mrs Otubanjo's evidence
      regarding her ex-husband and her own employment, when  accompanied  by
      HMRC tax returns was insufficient to make out her case that  both  her
      husband and herself had been economically active as claimed.

  11. Given that the ultimate findings in this case may well turn  upon  the
      credibility of the Appellant, when giving evidence, as regards to  her
      ex-husband's self-employment and also  her  own  earnings  and  income
      since the dissolution of the marriage, and  that  in  my  judgement  a
      reassessment of the case in its  entirety  is  required,  including  a
      reassessment of the  Appellant's  own  credibility  in  light  of  the
      evidence that was submitted, it  is  necessary  for  the  case  to  be
      remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing de  novo,  with
      no preserved findings of fact, before a differently constituted First-
      tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Afako  does  contain  material
errors of law and is set aside, with no preserved findings of fact;

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  re-hearing  before
any First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge Afako.
