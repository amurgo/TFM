For the appellant:     Ms J Fisher, instructed by M & K Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Shopon Ali, date of  birth  1.10.81,  is  a  citizen  of
    Bangladesh.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    James promulgated 7.3.16, dismissing his appeal against the decision of
    the Secretary of State, dated 23.6.15, to refuse  his  application  for
    leave to remain on human  rights  (private  and  family  life)  grounds
    outside the Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 18.2.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    8.8.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 12.9.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons summarised below, I found no error of law in the making
    of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge James to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant first came to the UK in 2008 as a family visitor.  He  failed
    to leave, his application for further leave to remain was refused  with
    no right of appeal, and he became an illegal overstayer. A human rights
    application in August 2009 was rejected as no fee was  received  and  a
    further human rights claim made in September 2009 was refused  with  no
    right of appeal in January 2011. He  sought  reconsideration,  and  was
    given a statement of additional grounds, and the refusal maintained  in
    the decision of 23.6.15.

 7. In essence, since arrival in the UK the appellant has  lived  with  his
    parents, who suffer from a number of physical and mental  ailments,  as
    described in the medical evidence. The appellant has  provided  day  to
    day support and personal care for his parents. The Local Authority  had
    a care package in place but it was cancelled as the appellant was happy
    to continue to provide care for his parents; effectively community care
    from the authorities was declined, as the judge found at �46 to �48  of
    the decision. The appellant has sisters settled in  the  UK,  but  they
    claim that they are busy with their own family commitments and children
    and are unable to provide care to their parents.  At  �50  Judge  James
    concluded that it was no more than a convenience for the  siblings  and
    the parents to allow the appellant to continue to provide care for  the
    parents. At �51 the judge concluded  that  it  was  only  the  family's
    reluctance to accept local authority care that prevents a care  package
    being in place.

 8. The appellant conceded that he could not meet the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for leave to remain. Considering the  matter  outside
    the Rules, the judge concluded that there was family life under article
    8 and  that  the  appellant's  removal  would  be  a  sufficient  grave
    interference to engage article 8. The  judge  also  accepted  that  the
    particular situation described above, with settled parents dependent on
    a child seeking leave to remain in the UK, is outside the provision  of
    the Immigration Rules. However, the judge did not accept that this  was
    an omission in the duty of the Secretary of  State  to  strike  a  fair
    balance when making the Rules.

 9. Ultimately, Judge James concluded that if the appellant were unable  to
    provide the  support  currently  enjoyed  by  his  parents,  the  local
    authority could and would provide the necessary care. The dependency is
    one of choice and not necessity, a matter of convenience to the family.
    The judge also took into account section 117B  of  the  2002  Act  when
    considering  the  public  interest  in  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise and dismissed the appeal.

10. In essence, the grounds seeking permission to appeal  assert  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge misdirected himself on the article 8(2)  ECHR
    burden of proof, that he erred in the application of the law  following
    SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387, that his  finding  that  the  appellant
    would become a burden on the public purse was irrational, that that  he
    failed to give adequate reasons for findings  as  to  alternative  care
    provisions, and that he failed to  consider  all  the  consequences  of
    removal.

11. The fact that there is no category in the Rules to cover this situation
    is an indication that the Secretary of State's view is that striking  a
    fair balance between the public interest and article 8 rights, does not
    require facilitating a claim of parents to depend  on  an  adult  child
    seeking leave to remain. Given that there is a comprehensive healthcare
    service in the UK which is capable of meeting the needs  of  residents,
    it would make no sense at all  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to  make
    provision for an adult child to remain in the UK to provide such  care.
    In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any 'gap' in the
    Rules, so that in my view it was not in any  event  necessary  for  the
    First-tier Tribunal to go on to consider article  8  ECHR  outside  the
    Rules, following SS (Congo), on the basis  that  these  are  compelling
    circumstances inadequately recognised by the Rules so as to render  the
    removal decision unjustifiably harsh.

12. In the circumstances, I reject the claim  that  the  judge  misdirected
    himself in consideration of SS (Congo). I am satisfied and courts  have
    generally found and upheld the conclusion that the Secretary  of  State
    has sought to strike the appropriate balance between article  8  rights
    and the public interest, in what was described  in  SS  (Congo)  as  "a
    focused assessment  of  considerations  of  the  public  interest."  It
    follows that  where  there  are  no  immigration  rules  to  cover  the
    circumstances  relied  on,  the  appellant  has  to  show  that   those
    circumstances are compelling and insufficiently recognised before a gap
    can be identified. I find no such gap.

13. If one takes the care needs out of the equation, on the basis,  as  the
    judge found, that they can be met otherwise than by the appellant,  the
    appellant's case amounts to little more than an  adult  child  with  an
    emotional bond with his elderly, infirm parents, with whom he has lived
    for several years whilst illegally present in the UK,  his  immigration
    status at best precarious and ultimately unlawful, with no right or any
    legitimate expectation that he would be able to remain. If that  is  to
    be considered outside the Rules, in which consideration the  fact  that
    he cannot meet any of the rules, including Appendix  FM  and  paragraph
    276ADE, is highly relevant, there are inevitably strong  countervailing
    public interest considerations, which  the  judge  has  comprehensively
    assessed in a fair and reasoned judgement.

14. In granting  permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Fisher  considered  it  an
    arguable error of law that at �10 of the decision  Judge  James  stated
    that the appellant bore the burden of proof and failed to refer to  the
    burden under article 8 on the Secretary  of  State  to  show  that  the
    removal was proportionate. Whilst the judge did mistate this burden,  I
    find that it is clear from a reading of the  decision  that  the  judge
    made a fair and detailed  assessment  of  proportionality,  taking  all
    relevant evidence into consideration, and that there is no  materiality
    in the misstatement of the burden.  On  the  factual  findings  of  the
    Tribunal, and the absence of provision under  Appendix  FM  for  family
    life covering these circumstances, the application of section 117B,  it
    was inevitable that on the  facts  of  this  case  the  proportionality
    assessment  would  fall  against  the  appellant.  The  proportionality
    assessment  was  properly  made  and  I  can  see  no  defect  in  that
    assessment. In effect, the error is not material to the outcome of  the
    appeal and I reject the submission that it did or could  have  infected
    the proportionality assessment.  The ground is no more than a technical
    objection.

15. Judge Fisher also suggested that there was a  'tension'  and  potential
    error of law between the findings that  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and his parents was not one which would engage article 8, and
    the conclusion at �52 that there was family life between them. However,
    �52 was the conclusion reached after the considerations between �43 and
    �51, in which the judge gave anxious scrutiny  to  the  nature  of  the
    relationship between the appellant and  his  parents,  considering  the
    evidence presented. Whilst the way in which it is set out could perhaps
    have been clearer, the statement in  �56,  that  the  circumstances  in
    which  the  appellant  finds  himself  are  not  those  to  which   the
    jurisprudence finds that there will be a family life in accordance with
    article 8 absent something more than normal emotional ties,  is  not  a
    finding that there is no family life to engage article 8, and thus  not
    an inconsistency that could be described as an error of law. Read  with
    �55, �56 makes perfect  sense.  The  judge  was  clearly  referring  to
    whether there was a gap between the Rules  and  the  particular  family
    life rights relied on under article 8. It is not entirely clear why the
    judge considered it appropriate to go on to consider article 8  outside
    the Rules, but that he did do so, was not to the appellant's prejudice.



16. Judge Fisher also suggested an arguable error of law in  a  failure  to
    give any or any adequate reasons for finding that the  appellant  would
    become a burden on the taxpayer if allowed to remain. As is  now  clear
    from the case law, under section 117B no credit can  be  gained  by  an
    appellant for being financially independent. However, that  he  is  not
    financially independent is an undeniable fact. Under section 117B it is
    in the public interest that persons seeking to remain  are  financially
    independent, which this appellant is not. As  made  clear  in  Rhuppiah
    [2016]  EWCA  Civ  803,  financially  independent  means  dependant  on
    himself, not someone else. Whether or not he would  in  fact  become  a
    burden on the taxpayer, it remains the case that he is not  financially
    independent, which Parliament has provided by statute a person  seeking
    to remain should be.  There is no material error of law on this ground.



17. Judge Fisher found it an arguable error of law  that  the  judge  found
    that the remainder of the family and the local authority could  provide
    adequate care, stating, "There does not appear to be any  consideration
    in the decision  of  the  emotional  consequences  of  the  appellant's
    separation from his parents." In reality, this ground is no more than a
    disagreement with the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge that it
    was a matter of convenience that  the  appellant  should  provide  care
    rather than a necessity. The judge was entitled  to  reject  the  claim
    that other family members settled in  the  UK  would  not  be  able  to
    provide at least some care and thus emotional support. It  is  not  the
    case that the parents would be left  without  such  emotional  support.
    Further, it is clear from any reading of the decision  that  the  judge
    made a careful assessment of the documentary evidence.  It  is  obvious
    that whatever care the siblings settled in the UK  could  not  provide,
    the local authority would have the duty to provide  for  the  necessary
    care for the parents. There was no evidence that  the  local  authority
    would not or could not provide sufficient care. The burden on this  lay
    with the appellant. State-provided care may not be to the standard  the
    family might like, and they would obviously  prefer  the  appellant  to
    remain to be able to provide this care, but the judge clearly  set  out
    the evidence on which this conclusion was arrived  at.  It  is  neither
    irrational nor perverse. As the Rule 24 response submits, the issue  of
    any emotional impact on the parents must be considered in  the  context
    of the findings that other members  of  the  family  could  assist  the
    parents, as they had done in the past. This is not  a  case  where  the
    parents would be left with no family support,  or  no  care  to  manage
    their illness and/or infirmity. Furthermore, it has to be borne in mind
    that the relationship, close though it may now  be,  is  one  that  was
    established whilst the  appellant's  immigration  status  was  entirely
    precarious. Thus the alleged closer  emotional  relationship  was  also
    precarious and the family had no legitimate expectation that  it  could
    continue. Those were  all  factors  the  judge  properly  brought  into
    account in the proportionality assessment.

18. In all the circumstances, for the reasons set out above,  there  is  no
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

Conclusions:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee  award.
I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
