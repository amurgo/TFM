Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms A. Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr T Hodson, Counsel instructed by Immigration Legal
Services


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is  a  citizen  of  Nigeria
    born on 2 January 1952. This appeal arises from  the  decision  of  the
    appellant  (hereinafter  "the  Secretary  of  State")  to  refuse   her
    application for leave to remain in the UK under the  Immigration  Rules
    and Article 8 of the ECHR.

    Background

 2. The claimant has spent a considerable amount of time in  the  UK.   The
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT") indicate that  she  was  in
    the UK between 1988 and 1993 during which time her son was  born.  From
    1993 until 2006 she spent most of her time  in  the  UK,  returning  to
    Nigeria regularly to renew visit visas. On 13 February 2006 she entered
    the UK and has remained in the UK continuously ever since.

 3. On 1 August 2006 she  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain.  Her
    application was refused and her subsequent appeal dismissed. Her  right
    of appeal became exhausted on 13 December 2006.

 4. She claims to have made a further application in  2007  which  was  not
    dealt with by the Secretary of State. In June 2012 she was served  with
    an IS.151A as an overstayer.

 5. In January 2011 the claimant met her partner, a British  Citizen,  with
    whom she started living in July 2014. In this decision I have  referred
    to the man with whom the claimant  is  living  as  her  "partner"  even
    though, as explained below, the FtT found that he  does  not  meet  the
    definition of partner in the relevant Rules. The term partner  in  this
    decision, unless it is stated to the contrary, is used in  its  general
    sense and does not imply the above mentioned definition is satisfied.

 6. On 13 August 2012 the  claimant  applied  for  leave  to  remain  under
    Article 8. On 10 December 2014  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  her
    application. It did not accept she was able to satisfy the  Immigration
    Rules or that there were exceptional circumstances such that she should
    be granted leave to remain outside the Rules.

 7. The claimant appealed and her appeal was heard by FtT Judge Cameron. In
    a decision promulgated on 31 July 2014, the FtT allowed the  claimant's
    appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

    Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The FtT  heard  evidence  from  the  claimant,  her  partner,  and  her
    partner's daughter, son  and  mother.  It  found  the  evidence  to  be
    credible and truthful.

 9. The FtT's factual findings, which have not been challenged, include the
    following:
 i. The claimant met her partner in January 2011 and has been  living  with
    him since July 2014. Before living  together  they  spent  considerable
    time together. The reason they did not start living together sooner was
    that her partner's daughter and grandson lived  with  the  partner  and
    there would not be sufficient space. In addition, there was  a  concern
    about how the neighbours would react to the relationship. At  paragraph
    83 the FtT stated that it was "satisfied that  [the claimant] is  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship with [her partner] and  that  there
    are genuine intentions to marry once [the claimant] is able to do so."
ii. The claimant last entered the UK in 2006 as a visitor and has never had
    leave in any other capacity.
iii. The claimant is financially dependent on her partner, receiving �100  a
    month from him in addition to him covering the cost of rent.
iv. The claimant's partner receives an income of �1,900  a  month  from  an
    insurance policy due to an accident at  work  and  has  done  for  many
    years. The income would cease should he leave the UK permanently.
 v. The partner  has  a  daughter  who  suffers  from  depression  and  the
    claimant's partner provides assistance to her.
vi. The claimant made an application in 2007 (after her leave to remain had
    expired) which she has followed up on but has not been  dealt  with  by
    the Secretary of State. There was a further delay  of  over  two  years
    before the Secretary of State responded to the  application  that  gave
    rise to the present appeal.
vii. The claimant's son was deported to Nigeria on 25 November 2014.

10. Having made the aforementioned factual findings,  the  FtT  determined,
    firstly, that the claimant was unable to satisfy the Immigration Rules.
    It found that Appendix FM could not be satisfied because  the  claimant
    did not meet the definition of a partner under GEN 1.2, which specifies
    that partners must have been living together for at least two years. As
    the claimant and her partner only began living together  in  July  2014
    they were unable  to  avail  themselves  of  the  partner  route  under
    Appendix FM.

11. The FtT then considered the appeal outside the  Immigration  Rules.  It
    acknowledged that the claimant's immigration  status  has  always  been
    precarious and that she and her partner would have been aware  of  this
    when they formed their relationship but  that,  pursuant  to  paragraph
    117B(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the  2002
    Act"), although little weight should be given to the relationship  that
    did not mean it should be given no weight.

12. It found that notwithstanding  the  precariousness  of  the  claimant's
    status, the balancing exercise under Article 8  favoured  the  claimant
    because particular  circumstances  weighed  in  her  favour.   Foremost
    amongst these were the difficulties the claimant's partner  would  face
    if, in order to continue family life  with  the  claimant,  he  had  to
    relocate to Nigeria. The FtT's findings were that  he  would  lose  his
    regular income and be unable to continue supporting  his  daughter  who
    suffers from depression. At paragraph [93] the FtT stated that it would
    be unduly harsh and unreasonable to expect him to relocate to Nigeria.

13. The FtT also took into account the delays by  the  Secretary  of  State
    which had firstly enabled the claimant to develop a  private  life  and
    then to form and stabilise the relationship with her partner.  It  also
    stated that in making its decision it had taken into consideration  the
    principles in Chikwamba [2008]  UKHL  40,  finding  that,  although  in
    normal circumstances it would be in the public interest for someone who
    has remained in the UK without leave to not benefit from the breach, in
    the specific circumstances of this appeal it would not be proportionate
    to  require  the  claimant  to  leave  the  UK  simply  to  re-make  an
    application.

    Grounds of appeal and submissions

14. The Secretary of State's first ground of appeal is that the  FtT  erred
    by  carrying  out  a  "freestanding  Article  8"   assessment   without
    explaining why the case fell for consideration outside the  Immigration
    Rules given that the claimant's circumstances fell within the ambit  of
    the Rules, and that the FtT failed  to  establish  factors  that  would
    engaged, and a breach, of Article 8 outside the Rules.

15. The second ground is that the FtT treated the delay in considering  the
    application as determinative rather than a relevant factor to  consider
    as part of a holistic assessment.   Further,  there  was  an  error  in
    failing to explain why the claimant could not return to Nigeria to make
    a fresh application without her partner accompanying her.

16. The third ground of appeal is  that  the  FtT's  consideration  of  the
    public interest was only superficial and there has been failure to take
    into account the factors under Section 117B of the 2002 Act.

17. Before me, Ms Fijiwala argued that the FtT had failed to  identify,  in
    accordance  with  SS  (Congo)   [2015]   EWCA   Civ   387,   compelling
    circumstances  as  to  why  an  assessment  outside   the   Rules   was
    appropriate. She submitted that there were no  such  circumstances  and
    the assessment outwith the Rules  was  essentially  the  same  as  that
    within the Rules. She submitted that the FtT had failed to engage  with
    the public interest in the claimant's removal.

18. Ms Fijiawla also argued that the FtT erred  by  giving  weight  to  the
    delay  following  the  claimant's  2007  application.  The   claimant's
    relationship with her  partner  was  only  entered  into  in  2011  and
    therefore the delay in 2007 was immaterial to the development  of  that
    relationship which underpinned the Article 8 claim. With regard to  the
    delay following the 2012 application, this was only for two  years  and
    it was an error of law for the FtT to treat this as determinative.

19. Ms Fijiwala also argued that the FtT erred by relying on the principles
    in Chikwamba. The FtT had failed to take into account that the claimant
    could travel herself to  Nigeria  to  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance in accordance with the Rules  as  a  fianc�.  There  were  no
    findings to show why she could not travel alone. Further,  it  was  her
    contention that the FtT erred in assuming the claimant would be able to
    satisfy the Rules if she made an application from abroad when there was
    no evidence to support this.

20. Mr Hodson's  submissions  were  that  the  FtT  undertook  the  correct
    approach in first determining whether the claimant could succeed  under
    the Rules and then, because she could not, proceeding to  consider  the
    appeal outside the Rules. He argued that it is clear from the  decision
    why there are compelling reasons to allow the appeal outside the Rules.

21. Mr Hodson did not accept that the FtT  had  made  the  issue  of  delay
    determinative. He also argued that  even  temporary  interference  with
    family life, which would be the consequence of the claimant  travelling
    alone to Nigeria to apply for leave to enter, was disproportionate.  He
    also argued that the FtT had properly directed itself to the  issue  of
    public interest and had taken into account  the  claimant's  precarious
    immigration status.

    Consideration

22. The FtT gave only brief consideration to the Immigration  Rules  before
    turning to consider Article 8 generally.

23. Paragraph 276ADE of the Rules was dealt  with  in  only  one  line.  At
    paragraph [81]  of  the  decision  the  FtT  stated  that  it  was  not
    applicable as the claimant last entered the UK in 2006.  It  is  plain,
    from the factual findings, that Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  could  not  be
    satisfied. It is also clear from the decision that the claimant did not
    advance any argument in respect of 276ADE(1)(vi) and that it was not at
    issue before the FtT. In these circumstances, although  it  would  have
    been preferable had the FtT given an explanation as  to  why  Paragraph
    276ADE was not satisfied, there was no error of law in it not doing so.



24. The focus of the  appeal  before  the  FtT,  quite  properly,  was  the
    relationship between the claimant and her partner and the relevant part
    of the Rules was paragraph EX.1(b) of Appendix FM.

25. In order to satisfy EX.1(b) and be  entitled  to  leave  to  remain  in
    consequence thereof the claimant was required to show:
 i. that she has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a  partner  who
    is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK or in  the  UK
    with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
ii. that there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  that
    partner continuing outside the UK.

26. At paragraphs [79-80] the FtT made a finding that  the  claimant  could
    not satisfy  EX.1(b)  because  although  she  was  in  a  "genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with a British Citizen", that  British  Citizen
    was not her "partner" as defined in Appendix  FM.  Under  GEN  1.2  she
    would have to have been living with him for at least two  years  to  be
    his "partner" but she had only been living together with him since July
    2014. At paragraph [82] the FtT stated that this position  appeared  to
    have been conceded by the claimant.

27. Having determined (and taken into account the  apparent  concession  of
    the claimant) that Appendix FM  could  not  be  satisfied  because  the
    definition of partner was not met, the FtT did not proceed to  consider
    whether the second part of EX.1(b)  was  satisfied;  that  is,  whether
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family life between the claimant
    and her partner continuing outside the UK. Instead, the  FtT  proceeded
    to consider the claim outside the Rules.

28. There was no error in this approach. As is now well established in  the
    case law - see for example the headnote to R  (on  the  application  of
    Esther Ebun Oludoyi & Ors) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    (Article 8 - MM (Lebanon) and Nagre) IJR [2014] UKUT 539 (IAC)  -  once
    the FtT decided the appeal could not be decided  under  the  Rules  (in
    this case, because the definition of "partner" was not  satisfied)  the
    proper course was to look at the evidence to see if there was  anything
    which had not already been adequately considered in the context of  the
    Immigration Rules and which could lead to a successful Article 8 claim.
    I am satisfied that the FtT followed this approach and  therefore  that
    it did not make an error of law in proceeding to  consider  the  appeal
    outside the Rules.

29. Ms Fijiwala's argument before me, however, was not only that the appeal
    should not have been considered outside the Rules, but  also  that  the
    freestanding Article 8 assessment by the  FtT  was  flawed  because  it
    failed to show there were compelling circumstances.

30. I agree  with  Ms  Fijiwala  that  the  claimant  would  need  to  show
    compelling circumstances to support  her  claim  for  leave  to  remain
    outside the Rules. The claimant's relationship  with  her  partner  was
    formed at a time when her immigration status was precarious and as made
    clear in Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) at [48]
         "... in the majority of precarious family life cases where  removal
         is in question, where the Secretary of State's  officials  conclude
         that the family member who is applying for leave to  remain  cannot
         satisfy the test in  Section  EX.1(b)  in  the  new  rules,  it  is
         unlikely that there will be a good arguable case (let alone a  case
         that is ultimately found to be established) that  Article  8  would
         require that leave to remain should be granted outside the Rules."

31. The FtT did not make an explicit finding that  there  were  "compelling
    circumstances" in favour of the claimant. Nor did  it  state  in  clear
    terms why this case falls into the small minority  of  precarious  life
    cases where  removal  of  the  non  national  family  member  would  be
    disproportionate. However, that, in substance, is what in fact the  FtT
    found.

32. The FtT's factual findings, which were not disputed, include  that  (1)
    the claimant's partner provides  vital  support  to  his  daughter  who
    suffers from depression; (2) he has  a  disability  that  prevents  him
    working and is in receipt of a significantly monthly income that  would
    terminate if he moved  permanently  abroad;  and  (3)  he  assists  his
    daughter financially which would not be able to continue if he lost his
    income in consequence of moving abroad.  Having made these findings the
    Judge determined, at paragraph [93], that it would be unduly harsh  and
    unreasonable to expect the claimant's partner to  relocate  permanently
    to Nigeria to maintain family life with the claimant.

33. Moreover, the FtT found the claimant and her partner to be in a genuine
    and subsisting relationship where they intended to marry and where they
    had spent considerable time together, as a couple, before cohabiting.

34. These factual findings, taken together and considered in the round, can
    properly be described as "compelling circumstances".  The FtT  did  not
    use this phrase, or an analogous one, but that does not  amount  to  an
    error of law. It was made clear in Haleemudeen v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 558 at [47] that a judge  does  not
    need to use the words "exceptional" or  "compelling"  to  describe  the
    circumstances under consideration, and it will suffice if that  can  be
    said to be the substance of the tribunal's decision.  For  the  reasons
    set out above, I am satisfied that the substance of the decision  shows
    that the FtT found there to be  circumstances  which  can  properly  be
    described as compelling or exceptional.

35. The grounds argue that the  FtT  improperly  treated  the  delay  as  a
    determinative factor. I do  not  accept  this  is  the  case.  The  FtT
    identified a range of  factors  which  it  weighed  in  favour  of  the
    claimant, including in particular the unduly harsh consequences for her
    partner arising from his particular financial and family circumstances.
    Delay was only one element which was taken into account.

36. Nor do I accept the Secretary of State's argument that the  FtT  failed
    to address the  public  interest  in  the  claimant's  removal.  It  is
    apparent from the decision that the FtT took into account  the  factors
    set out in Section 117B  of  the  2002  Act  including  the  claimant's
    precarious immigration status and  financial  circumstances  but  found
    them to be outweighed by factors weighing in favour of the claimant.

37. For the reasons I have explained, the FtT was entitled,  based  on  the
    evidence before it, to find that, even  though  the  claimant's  family
    life was established in the knowledge that she had no right  to  be  in
    the UK, there were compelling circumstances to support  her  claim  for
    leave  to  remain,  with  those  reasons  arising  primarily  from  the
    obstacles her partner would face in continuing  family  life  with  her
    outside the UK. In finding that removing the claimant from the UK would
    be a disproportionate interference with her rights under Article 8, the
    FtT made a decision that was open to it on the  evidence.  Accordingly,
    it did not make a material error of law.

    Decision
      a. The appeal is dismissed.
      b. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making
         of a material error of law and shall stand.
      c. No anonymity direction is made.
