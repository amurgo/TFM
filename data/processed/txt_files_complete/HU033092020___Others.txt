                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

Introduction

      1. The appellant ('the SSHD') has appealed against a decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal ('FTT') Judge Scott Baker, sent on 18  February
         2021, allowing the respondents' appeals on Article 8, ECHR grounds.

      2. I gave an ex-tempore judgment  on  30  June  2021,  dismissing  the
         respondent's appeal.  Regrettably due to  a  technical  fault,  the
         recording equipment did not record  this  judgment  at  an  audible
         level.  Both representatives were therefore  invited  to  file  and
         serve their notes of the ex-tempore judgment, which I now summarise
         in this decision.  I am grateful to both representatives for  their
         assistance in this regard.

Background

      3. The first respondent is the  spouse  of  a  British  citizen  ('the
         sponsor').  The second and third respondents are their children.

      4. As noted by the FTT, there was no credibility issue raised  in  the
         appeals and the undisputed background facts are recorded by the FTT
         at [12-23].  I therefore need only summarise the  background  facts
         here.  The sponsor came to the UK in 2000.  He  married  the  first
         respondent in India in 2002, and the second and  third  respondents
         were born in 2002 and 2004 respectively.    The  respondents  lived
         with the first respondent's brother until 2015, when they  came  to
         UK in order to settle with the  sponsor,  in  accordance  with  the
         Immigration Rules, having been granted limited leave to  enter  the
         UK.

      5. In May 2017 the sponsor suffered a heart-attack.  The  respondents'
         application to extend  their  leave  was  refused,  which  was  the
         subject  of  an  unsuccessful  appeal  -  see  the  FTT's  decision
         promulgated on 19 July 2019.  Their further application was refused
         in a decision dated 20 February 2020.   Although  the  sponsor  was
         working at the time, he  could  not  meet  financial  threshold  of
         �24,800pa, because for health-related reasons he  could  only  work
         limited hours and  was  earning  approximately  �22,000pa  for  the
         relevant period.  In addition, the first respondent was  unable  to
         establish that she had passed English at level A2, albeit  she  had
         previously passed at level A1.

FTT decision

      6. The FTT noted that the SSHD was of the  view  that  there  were  no
         insurmountable obstacles to family life in India  and  referred  to
         this reasoning at [3].   The FTT went on  to  record  that  it  was
         undisputed that the respondents could not meet the requirements  of
         the Rules in two respects: the  first  respondent  had  not  passed
         level A2 English, and; the minimum income requirement was not  met.
         The FTT noted that the family was intent on settling in the UK  and
         did so lawfully, but that the sponsor's heart  condition  meant  he
         could not work the required hours he had done previously - see [24]
         to [26].

      7. The FTT acknowledged that the respondents were unable to  meet  the
         requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  but  concluded  that  the
         refusal of leave would result in unjustifiably harsh  consequences,
         such that the appeal was allowed on Article  8  grounds.   Although
         the FTT did not regard this to be "the strongest  of  cases  to  be
         allowed under Article 8" (see [38]), it concluded that the  factors
         on  the  respondents'   side   outweighed   the   public   interest
         requirements in the proportionality assessment.

Appeal to the Upper Tribunal ('UT')

      8. The SSHD  applied  for  permission  to  appeal  against  the  FTT's
         decision in three succinct grounds of appeal.

          i) When conducting the balancing exercise, the FTT failed to take
             into account that it is the mere wish of the family to  remain
             in the UK and they could exercise the choice to  enjoy  family
             life in India, and failed  to  give  adequate  weight  to  the
             public interest.




         ii) The FTT used Article 8 as "a general dispensing power" without
             properly addressing the fact that  the  first  respondent  was
             unable to provide the requisite English  language  certificate
             and the requisite financial threshold could not be met.




        iii) The FTT  failed  to  pay  regard  to  the  2019  FTT  decision
             dismissing the respondents' appeals (albeit the SSHD  accepted
             that the decision was not before the FTT).

      9. FTT Judge Froom granted permission to appeal in a decision dated 17
         March 2021.

     10. At the beginning of  the  hearing  before  me  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe
         agreed with my summary of the grounds  of  appeal  above  and  made
         brief oral submissions in support of  these.   After  hearing  from
         both representatives, I gave an ex-tempore decision,  which  I  now
         summarise here.

Discussion

Ground 1 - choice / public interest

     11. When the decision is read as a whole, the FTT accepted the
         respondent's submission that the family were unable to establish
         that there would be insurmountable obstacles to establishing family
         life in India - see in particular [3] and [21] to [25] of the FTT
         decision.  It is regrettable that the FTT did not state this
         expressly but the decision has been structured on the basis that
         the Rules, including EX.1 of Appendix EU could not be met, and the
         real issue in dispute was whether notwithstanding this, the
         decision breached Article 8.

     12. The FTT was entitled to make the finding at [28] that it  would  be
         unreasonable to expect the sponsor to return to India in the  light
         of a combination of factors: his residence in the UK  for  over  20
         years, his heart condition and employment in the UK.  When the  FTT
         referred to it not being reasonable to expect the sponsor to return
         to India, it did so when considering the Razgar questions 1 and 2.

     13. When read as a whole, I am not satisfied that the FTT has  replaced
         the test of insurmountable obstacles with  one  of  reasonableness.
         It is  clear  that  the  FTT  was  mindful  of  the  insurmountable
         obstacles test in  EX.1  of  the  Rules.   The  FTT  drew  specific
         attention to [48] of R (Agyarko)  v  SSHD  [2017]  UKSC  11,  which
         explains the position as follows:

             "... If the applicant or his or her partner  would  face  very
             significant  difficulties  in  continuing  their  family  life
             together outside the UK, which could not be overcome or  would
             entail  very  serious  hardship,  then   the   "insurmountable
             obstacles" test will be met, and leave will be  granted  under
             the Rules. If that test is not met, but  the  refusal  of  the
             application would result in unjustifiably harsh  consequences,
             such that refusal would not be proportionate, then leave  will
             be granted outside the Rules  on  the  basis  that  there  are
             "exceptional circumstances"..."

     14.  Whilst  the  FTT  did  not  expressly  state  that  the  test   of
         insurmountable obstacles within the Rules  could  not  be  met,  it
         cannot be said that the FTT was not mindful of it.  It was  not  an
         issue in dispute. It appears to have been accepted on behalf of the
         respondents  that   the   elevated   threshold   of   demonstrating
         insurmountable obstacles for the purposes of the Rules,  could  not
         be met.   The  FTT  was  therefore  well  aware  that  although  it
         considered  that  the  sponsor's  relocation  to  India  would   be
         unreasonable, there were  no  insurmountable  obstacles  preventing
         this.  As highlighted in GM (Sri Lanka) v SSHD [2019] EWCA Civ 1630
         at [48] for the purposes of Article 8, insurmountable obstacles  is
         a relevant factor (which this FTT was mindful of) and not the test.



     15. In reality the FTT could not lawfully proceed upon  the  assumption
         that the sponsor would choose to leave the UK.  He remained in  the
         UK for many years prior to the respondents' arrival in 2015.  Since
         then, the FTT found there were  additional  reasons  rendering  his
         choice to  remain  in  the  UK  reasonable.  The  position  of  the
         respondents  and  especially  the  children  therefore  had  to  be
         analysed in the context of an acceptance  that  the  sponsor  would
         stay and, this being so, the family would be ruptured and fractured
         and the children would suffer from  separation  from  their  father
         when it was common ground that he was  the  bread  winner  and  the
         children benefited from having two parents - see similar  arguments
         accepted by the Court of Appeal in GM at [44] and [45].

     16. I do not accept that the FTT did not give adequate consideration to
         the public interest or attach significant  weight  to  it.   It  is
         sufficiently clear from [32-35] that the FTT was fully  aware  that
         the  requirements  of  the  Rules  could  not  be  met   and   that
         considerable weight must be attached to  the  public  interest,  as
         represented  in  the  Rules.   The  FTT  clearly   understood   the
         significance of the Rules not being  met  upon  the  weight  to  be
         attached to the public interest having expressly directed itself to
         this and the relevant authorities in  support  of  that  well-known
         proposition - see by way of example the FTT's reference to [46] and
         [47] of Agyarko at [32] and the further reference to  the  approach
         in Agyarko at [35] and [39].  It is at this juncture that  the  FTT
         also considered the public interest considerations pursuant  to  s.
         117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The
         grounds do not criticise the FTT's approach to the public  interest
         considerations.

Ground 2 - general dispensing power

     17. When the decision is read as a whole, the  FTT  applied  the  well-
         known principles in the authorities  and  did  not  simply  utilise
         Article 8 as a general dispensing power. The FTT expressly directed
         itself to the considerable weight to  be  attached  to  the  public
         interest and the need to identify unjustifiably harsh consequences.
          Ground 2 appears to criticise the FTT for not fully  dealing  with
         relevant matters, in particular the first respondent's  failure  to
         explain why she did not seek the return of her passport or make  up
         the short fall in the income of the family. Although evidence could
         have been adduced on these matters, it is unclear whether the first
         respondent was asked about this.  In any event, this would not have
         advanced the SSHD's position because the appeal was  determined  on
         the basis that the respondents did not meet these  aspects  of  the
         Rules.

     18. I do not regard the grounds as amounting to  a  reasons  challenge,
         but, if I am wrong about this, I am  satisfied  that  the  FTT  has
         given tolerably clear reasons for the conclusion that  the  refusal
         of leave  would  lead  unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  for  the
         purposes of the Article 8  proportionality  assessment.    The  FTT
         identified the material aspects of the claim demonstrating  why  it
         was unjustifiably harsh to refuse.  Whilst these  might  have  been
         expressed more clearly, the decision needs to be read as  a  whole.
         When it is, the FTT may have reached a generous  decision,  but  it
         cannot be said to be perverse (which in any event was not argued in
         the grounds of appeal).  The FTT was entitled to take the following
         matters into account:

               a) The family has at all times  sought  to  comply  with  the
                  requirements of the Rules and the respondents were on 'the
                  pathway to settled status'.  This puts them in a  stronger
                  position than those not on such a pathway and  this  needs
                  to be taken into account as  one  of  the  'pros'  in  the
                  proportionality assessment - see GM at [34].




               b) The respondents were unable to meet  the  requirements  of
                  the Rules  for  two  main  reasons,  each  of  which  have
                  mitigating features.  First, the health  of  the  sponsor,
                  which was outside of his control and  clear  efforts  were
                  made to get as close to the minimum income requirements as
                  possible.  Second, although the first respondent  did  not
                  attain level A2 English, she was still  able  to  evidence
                  basic English language skills.  As the FTT  observed,  the
                  issue was not that she was unable  to  speak  English  but
                  that the SSHD retained the passport she  required  to  sit
                  the further requisite English test.


               c) Although the FTT did not regard the best interests of  the
                  children to be determinative (see [27]), it  was  entitled
                  to factor these in: they came to the UK lawfully  at  ages
                  13 and 11 in 2015 and spent formative  years  in  the  UK,
                  with every expectation that they  would  be  permitted  to
                  settle  but  for  the  unexpected  deterioration  in   the
                  sponsor's health.


               d) Although the insurmountable obstacles test  could  not  be
                  met, the FTT regarded the sponsor's return to India to  be
                  unreasonable.

     19. The FTT expressly applied considered the s.  117B  public  interest
         considerations and balanced the weighty public interest against the
         'pros' considered cumulatively, before reaching the conclusion that
         the  refusal  of  leave   would   lead   to   unjustifiably   harsh
         consequences.    Whilst  this  might  be  considered   a   generous
         conclusion, it is not infected by an error of law.

Ground 3 - 2018 FTT decision

     20. It is clear from [17] of the FTT's decision, that the SSHD, who was
         represented at the hearing before the FTT, did  not  seek  to  rely
         upon the earlier refusal or the 2019 FTT decision.

     21. The 2019 FTT decision was belatedly provided to the UT pursuant  to
         a rule 15(2A) application on 29 June 2021 (the day  before  the  UT
         hearing).  No explanation was provided as to why it was provided so
         late.  The grounds of appeal  make  no  attempt  to  explain  which
         previous findings should have informed this FTT's 'starting point'.
          This is significant because the FTT made it  clear  at  [11]  that
         there is no issue of credibility in the appeals.  There has been no
         appeal against that finding.  The grounds do not  submit  that  the
         FTT made a material mistake of fact causing unfairness.   The  2019
         FTT decision could and should have been before the FTT, if  it  was
         being relied upon.  It was not relied upon either in  the  decision
         under appeal or at the hearing.  It is important that  all  parties
         respect finality of litigation.  In the absence of any  explanation
         as to the reasons for the late submission of the 2019 FTT  decision
         or in what manner it is said it  would  have  led  to  a  different
         result, I decline to admit the 2019 FTT decision.

     22. If I am wrong about that and the decision  should  be  admitted,  I
         have not been given a single submission explaining the relevance of
         the 2019 FTT decision in identifying an error of law in  the  FTT's
         decision other than the vague reference to it forming  a  'starting
         point'.   This has not been particularised or reconciled  with  the
         FTT's apparently uncontroversial indication  that  credibility  was
         not in issue.  Although I note the findings on suitability  in  the
         2019 FTT decision, these findings are not relied upon in the SSHD's
         decision under appeal dated 20 February 2020, which take  no  issue
         with suitability.  The FTT did not make an error of law in  failing
         to consider a document that was not before it,  in  the  particular
         circumstances of this case.



Notice of decision

23. The FTT decision does not contain an error of law and I do not  set  it
    aside.
