                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    This is an appeal by the  claimant  from  the  determination  of  Miss
      Sawetz sitting as an Adjudicator on 15 April 2001.

2.    The claimant is a citizen of Turkey who is  an  Alevi  Kurd  from  the
      South East of that country.

3.    The Adjudicator found that he would not be at real risk on  return  to
      Turkey despite the  fact  that  she  found  his  evidence  about  past
      mistreatment to be credible.   The grounds of appeal  state  that  the
      Adjudicator, in coming  to  that  finding,  did  not  give  sufficient
      weight, or gave insufficient detail for one to be sure  that  she  had
      given sufficient weight, to the relevance to risk  on  return  of  the
      experiences that the claimant had actually had.

4.    Having heard submissions on  this  point  and  having  considered  the
      grounds of appeal, which are necessarily lengthy in this case, we have
      come this conclusion that there is substance in those  criticisms  and
      that it is difficult  to  tell  from  the  determination  whether  the
      Adjudicator did give the weight that was appropriate to the claimant's
      account.

5.    The Adjudicator is not to be criticised for  making  her  findings  in
      the way that she did.   This determination was arrived at a long  time
      ago, and there have been many cases before  the  Tribunal  since  then
      which have dealt with the vexed issue of the risks  facing  Turks  who
      are being returned to Turkey and  who  have  been  mistreated  by  the
      authorities in the past.

6.     The  claimant  was  born  on  21  April  1978.    His  father  was  a
      sympathiser with the PKK and sheltered members of the PKK who used  to
      visit his home  in the vicinity of Diyarbakir in  South  East  Turkey.
      His father was detained and tortured by the authorities as a result of
      his activities.

7.    The claimant himself has never been a member of any  political  party,
      although before 1996 he used to attend HADEP meetings, cleaning up and
      making tea.

8.    During that year he  was  detained  twice  because  of  his  political
      sympathies.   His first detention led to  him  undergoing  7  days  of
      torture whilst in the hands of  the  authorities.    He  was  released
      entirely because he had a maternal uncle who was the mayor of  a  town
      called Narli and  was able to help him. His  fingerprints  were  taken
      before his release.

9.    After his release the local gendarmes, who obviously knew who he  was,
      used to abuse him verbally when they saw him, and it is  obvious  that
      he was a person who remained under suspicion, at least in their eyes.

10.   His second detention led to him again being  beaten  and  tortured  in
      order to extract a confession of political involvement.  This time  he
      was tortured for about 8 days before he was released.  He  appears  to
      have been released because  the  authorities  accepted  there  was  no
      evidence against him that was going to be capable of  leading  to  any
      criminal charges.

11.   After his release he went to Istanbul in order to try and  escape  the
      pressure that he felt under at home and no doubt to make a new  start.
      He got a job working in a textile company where he remained for 4 or 5
      months.   He was then unemployed  for  a  while  but  was  given  work
      through a friend in a coffee house.   He remained  working  there  for
      some time and obviously felt sufficiently secure to make a short visit
      home.  It does  not  appear  that  anything  untoward  happened  until
      October 1998.

12.   On that occasion there was a police sweep through the  caf�  in  which
      he was working.   ID cards were produced and it was discovered by  the
      authorities that he was evading the draft.   He was taken back to  his
      home area and was detained for 45 days before being sent off  for  his
      military service.    During the time of  his  detention  it  was  made
      plain to him that the authorities were of the view that  he  had  been
      helping the PKK.    He did not know what records had been kept on him,
      but  it  appeared  that  some  records  must  have  been   for   these
      accusations to be made against him.

13.   He was released from military service in May 2000 and returned to  his
      home village; but the position there soon became  intolerable  as  the
      gendarmes continued to harass and ask other villagers  about  his  and
      his father's whereabouts.    He went into hiding at his  uncle's  home
      in another village, but only for a short period, before  returning  to
      Istanbul.

14.   In September 2000, when he was back working at the same caf�,  he  was
      arrested again and, although he was only detained for a day, what  the
      authorities said to him made it clear that  they  were  aware  of  his
      previous detentions.   He said to them that that was all in  the  past
      and he was not involved in anything political any more and just wanted
      to carry on working.   He was released within a  day  and  during  his
      detention there is no suggestion that he was tortured.    A  few  days
      later he telephoned home and  was  advised  by  his  father  that  the
      gendarmes were maintaining an interest in him.   He  decided  that  he
      would not go back home because he was afraid  of  being  detained  and
      tortured again, went into hiding, and then left Turkey about 2� months
      later.    He arrived in the United Kingdom  on  1  December  2000  and
      claimed asylum.

15.   He says that with this  past  he  would  be  at  real  risk  of  being
      detained by the authorities if he were to be returned to Turkey.   The
      authorities seem to know who he  is  on  a  nationwide  basis  because
      otherwise they could not have known  in  September  2000  in  Istanbul
      about his previous detentions in the south,  or  about  any  suspicion
      that he was connected with the PKK.   He says that he fulfils some  of
      the criteria which would show him to be a person at heightened risk of
      being detained by the authorities  set out in the well known  case  of
      Acdog.   These are that he has family members who  have  fallen  under
      suspicion, he has been detained himself twice for protracted  periods,
      he is a Kurd and he is an Alevi.

16.   As against that it has been submitted that there is no real risk  that
      he will be picked out on return to Istanbul, and if he is  not  picked
      out there, there is no real risk that he will be  detained  thereafter
      within Turkey by the authorities unless, perhaps, he  returns  to  his
      home area.   We are concerned principally in  this  appeal  with  what
      risk he is going  to  run  when  he  passes  through  the  airport  at
      Istanbul, because after he has done  that  he  can  mix  in  with  the
      remainder of the population of Turkey, unless there is some particular
      reason to suppose that he will,  because  of  his  characteristics  or
      past, be likely to  be  at  real  risk  of  being  picked  up  by  the
      authorities wherever he goes.

16.   The detail of what happens on return to Istanbul airport has been  the
      subject of a number of authorities before the  Tribunal.    Until  the
      recent case of O [2004] UKIAT 00038  the  Tribunal  had  not  had  the
      opportunity of considering detailed information  about  what  actually
      appears on the Turkish computer system that is said to be used at  the
      airport and which is described as the GBTS.     That  information  was
      only made available in about September 2003.  It was not available  to
      the Tribunal who considered Acdog.

17.   In the case of  O  the  Tribunal  had  before  it  a  letter  dated  3
      September 2003 from the Department for  Anti-Smuggling  and  Organised
      Crimes in Turkey which set out precisely what it was that was said was
      registered on the GBTS.

18.   Because the matter is fully set out in O and was  fully  discussed  in
      the argument before us it is not necessary to set out in  detail  what
      was contained within that letter.  It was common ground that  if  what
      was on the GBTS was what was said in the letter of 3 September 2003 to
      be on the GBTS then the claimant would not be on it, because, put very
      shortly, unless someone has been through a  procedure  which  requires
      some sort of judicial oversight  the  formalities  that  are  required
      before a record is made on  that computer will not have been  complied
      with and he will not be there.   There are exceptions  to  that  broad
      statement but they are not material to the facts of this case.

19.   That being so, the argument before us centred  mainly  on   whether  O
      was correct in  saying  that  the  GBTS  contained  what  the  Turkish
      officials said it did, and  whether there was a real  likelihood  that
      some other means of checking up on persons  returning  to  Turkey  was
      deployed at the airport as well.   If it was then  the  importance  of
      knowing what is on the GBTS is of course substantially diminished.

20.   We have been much assisted by  some  recent  material  that  has  been
      placed before us by the claimant.    This material consists  of  three
      reports. They are dated 6 February  2004  from  Mr  Kanat,  a  Turkish
      lawyer; 16 March 2004 from Sheri Laizer; and a report of 19 March 2004
      from David McDowall.

21.   We deal first with the report of Mr Kanat.     He  is  an  experienced
      defence lawyer in  Turkey  who  has  defended  what  he  described  as
      political cases in the state security courts.  He also has a  practice
      in the non-criminal field.  In  our  judgment  his  views  must  carry
      considerable weight.  His report on the GBTS reads as follows:

      "Information and details of those individuals  who  have  been  issued
      with arrest and search warrants by the approved legal departments  are
      recorded on this system.  These records are not erased from the system
      until the individual  is  captured,  arrested  detained.   Should  the
      individual be captured then the  records  from  this  system  will  be
      erased.

      Arrest, Detention and Search Warrants are only issued by the  judicial
      departments such as the Public Prosecutors Office  or  by  the  Judges
      Offices.  In principle, the arresting parties  such  as  the  security
      forces must inform the judicial departments no  later  than  24  hours
      after the warrant has been executed.  After notification,  the  matter
      will be passed on to the judiciary for  procedure  to  follow.   If  a
      citizen is formally arrested but not charged,  he  too  may  have  his
      details recorded on this system.  For instance, this may  be  where  a
      warrant has been issued but the  individual  has  not  been  detained.
      (For example, a person  detained  on  remand  will  have  his  details
      recorded on the GBT).

      If an individual is taken into custody by the Anti-Terror  Branch,  or
      alternatively, the Security Forces, the individuals details  will  not
      be recorded on to the GBT system.  If he has a  record  then  this  is
      erased as the individual has been detained.

      However, in some cases we are aware, depending on the  nature  of  the
      offence/crime, even if details are erased from the system the security
      forces will have separate records/files.  In daily  language  this  is
      known as "a tab record".  "Fis Kaydi" (Informal records  kept  by  the
      Security Forces and Anti-Terror Branch).  These records do not cause a
      problem for the individual as such, however should the  individual  be
      taken into custody for another offence, the security forces will refer
      to this record and prepare a file in respect of previous incidents  to
      file with the judiciary.

      There is no compulsory legal  system  whereby  decisions  of  arrests,
      detentions and searches are  provided  to  the  municipal/registration
      offices.

      However, in practice,  this  is  not  the  case:  the  decision-making
      bodies are known to advise the Nufus registration departments, whereby
      notes are attached to the individuals' files.  If, thus, a person  who
      is  wanted  applies  for  a  copy  of  his  Nufus  registration,   the
      registration  office  will  immediately  contact  the  decision-making
      bodies.  If an individual's GBT record is erased, then the  record  is
      also erased from the Nufus registration record.

      The computer system at the airport does contain the GBT records  -  at
      times, not all of these GBT records are contained.  But, it should  be
      noted that the records contained in their computers  are  the  records
      contained in the GBT."

22.   It seem to us to be clear from this report  that  the  computers  that
      are at the airports are the GBTS computers and  the  information  they
      contain is what is on the GBTS records.  It is also plain  that  there
      are other less formal records that are maintained but that these  will
      not be looked at unless somebody is placed into custody.   There is no
      suggestion that people are being picked up at the airport  because  of
      these information files.

23.   We turn now to the report of  Sheri  Laizer.  We  have  considered  in
      particular Part 3 which deals with  political returnees to Turkey.  We
      cannot see anything that suggests that the authorities use any  system
      other than the GBTS as a filter  when  dealing  with  returned  failed
      asylum seekers to Turkey.    She makes the point  that  police  checks
      into a persons records may reveal other aspects  of  their  past  than
      that held on the GBTS, and mentions that if detained a returnee  could
      be removed from the airport to the anti-terror branch.    This  is  no
      doubt correct, but begs the question of what it is that is  likely  to
      cause such removal. If someone does not feature on the GBTS, which  is
      the means of checking that is used, according to O and Mr. Kanat,   it
      seems to us  that,  unless  there  is  something  else  to  alert  the
      authorities, there no real likelihood that that will happen.

24.   Finally, we have been referred to the  report  of  Mr  McDowall.    He
      states frankly that he does not know what happens to  returned  asylum
      seekers at page 3 of his report.

      "The consequence is that we are  guessing  including  the  governments
      cited as sources in the TCA,  as to the true number who are mistreated
      either on re-entry or later."

25.   He goes on to make a point, however, that  in  his  opinion  the  GBTS
      cannot be the filter which supplied by  the  authorities  because  its
      mesh is not fine enough.   One can see the sense  of  that  statement,
      but it does seem to us that the evidence  points  to  the  fact  that,
      whether adequate or not, the GBTS is what the authorities at  Istanbul
      airport actually use.  At page 6 of his report he deals with the  GBTS
      system and says that  the  Kurdish  Human  Rights  Project,  who  have
      analysed the GBTS say that in fact its ambit is wider than the  letter
      of 3 September 2003  would have one believe.  He sets out  the  KHRP's
      statement on this matter at length and with  one  exception  which  is
      relevant to the matter before us it seems to us,  with  respect,  that
      the KHRP have come to very much the same conclusion as to what  is  on
      the GBTS as did the Tribunal in  O  and  Mr  Kanat.    That  exception
      appears at the top of page 8 of the report of McDowall which reads:

      "Where the person detained is alleged to have been politically  active
      or is otherwise perceived as an opponent of the state, it is  practice
      for their detentions to be recorded on the GBT".

26.   We cannot see what support there is  in  any  of  the  other  material
      before us for that assertion.   It is contradicted by  what  Mr  Kanat
      has to say and is contradicted by the  letter  of  3  September  2003.
      Moreover, it has been stated on a number of occasions including by  Mr
      McDowall, that the vast majority of detentions of political  detainees
      go completely unrecorded by anybody.

27.   We feel that we are driven to the conclusion by all the material  that
      we have heard some of which comes from  sources  entirely  unconnected
      with the authorities in Turkey, that on arrival  in  Turkey  a  person
      will be screened by being  checked  on  the  GBTS.   We  have  neither
      information, nor any reason  to  suppose,  that  any  other  means  of
      checking up is used.

28.   That deals with the case of a person who is returning  to  Turkey  who
      does not stand out as somebody with  whom  the  authorities  would  be
      likely to be interested.    However, asylum  seekers  will  frequently
      not be travelling on orthodox Turkish papers when they return  and  it
      is has been suggested to us that in the case  of  such  a  person  the
      Turkish authorities will detain them and will make checks from sources
      other than GBTS.   We consider that that is a point that may well have
      considerable force but its ambit must  be  looked  at  carefully.   We
      consider that the CIPU report is helpful as a starting  point  and  we
      will turn first to the  October  2003  report.    We  will  quote  the
      passages which appear to us to be relevant:

      "6.101      The German immigration authorities reported in  July  1999
           that in general rejected asylum seekers returning to  Turkey  do
           not  risk  persecution.   A  rejected  asylum  seeker  returning
           voluntarily can pass through entry control unhindered,  provided
           that he/she is in possession of a valid Turkish travel document.
              The fact that the returnee is a failed asylum seeker does not
           lead to different treatment.  The Turkish authorities  are  well
           aware of the fact that many Turkish nationals apply  for  asylum
           only for the  purpose  of  getting  temporary  authorisation  to
           remain in Germany.

      6.102 A Senior Official at the Visa Dept, Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
           told the IND fact-Finding mission to Turkey in March  2001  that
           for the past five to ten years Turkey had not  denied  passports
           to undocumented would-be returnees, although it had denied  them
           in  the  1980s.   He  said  that  the  Turkish  government   now
           recognised that the overwhelming majority of  Turkish  nationals
           who had applied for asylum  overseas  had  done  so  purely  for
           economic reasons.  They were  of  no  interest  to  the  Turkish
           government, and would not be imprisoned on return.   The airport
           police might question them about,  for  example,  the  loss  and
           destruction of their passports, but this would  be  a  low-level
           investigation.  The subjects would quickly be  released,  almost
           certainly without charge, and allowed to go  about  their  daily
           life without hindrance."

      6.103 Turkey does not at present accept the removal to Turkey of Turks
           using EU letters  (which  are  standard  formal  travel/identity
           documents adopted by the General Secretariat of the  Council  of
           the EU in its recommendation of 30 November 1994) and Turks  who
           are  without  passports  are  therefore  returned  on  one   way
           emergency travel documents which issued by  the  Turkish  Consul
           General in London.


      6.104 A returnee without a valid Turkish travel document is likely  to
           be given an in-depth questioning by the Turkish  border  police,
           and this is to be distinguished from the routine identity  check
           on arrival.   The German authorities stated in July  1999  that,
           as a rule, the questions refer to personal  data,  date  of  and
           reasons  for  departing  Turkey,  possible  criminal  record  in
           Germany and contacts with  illegal  Turkish  organisations.   In
           some cases further inquiries will  be  made  via  other  offices
           (e.g. prosecutor's  officer,  registrar's  office  at  the  last
           Turkish residence of the returnee) in order to find out  if  the
           returnees is liable  to  prosecution  for  a  criminal  offence.
           These enquiries can take from several  hours  to  several  days,
           during which time the returnee will be kept in custody....  Ill-
           treatment could not be ruled out in cases  where  returnees  are
           suspected separatists.


      6.105 Amnesty International in Germany stated  in  February  1999,  in
           relation to returns from Germany, that the  Turkish  authorities
           are more likely  to  be  suspicious  in  cases  where  a  person
           returning to Turkey is not carrying any valid personal documents
           in  accordance  with  regulations  or  is   carrying   documents
           indicating asylum proceedings abroad."


29.   We do not see how the claimant can bring himself in this  case  within
      paragraph 6.104 because he will be returning to Turkey if  he  returns
      at all at least on a one-way emergency travel document issued  by  the
      Turkish Consul General in London.   He will  therefore  have  a  valid
      Turkish travel document and would not be likely to be  given  the  in-
      depth questioning.

30.   It may be submitted that paragraph 6.105 rather water  this  statement
      down because he would be  carrying  documents  that  indicated  asylum
      proceedings abroad if on the one-way travel document.  It seems to  us
      that there is an answer to that and it is in the claimant's own hands.
         He may go to the Turkish  embassy  and  may  ask  for  a  passport.
      Turkey gives passports to  undocumented  would  be  returnees.     The
      claimant is undoubtedly Turkish and would be  able  to  establish  all
      relevant particulars  to the satisfaction of the  Turkish  authorities
      here.    If he were in possession of a passport we can see  no  reason
      why the authorities should look at him in  any  way  askance  when  he
      returns to Turkey.    A Turkish passport issued in the United  Kingdom
      is no indication whatever that he has sought asylum here; there  could
      be any number of reasons for it, including the expiry of his  previous
      passport, or loss of his previous passport.

31.   We do not find 6.105 easy to reconcile  with  6.101  but  if  being  a
      failed asylum  seeker  does  not  lead  to  different  treatment  then
      presumably suspicions are not enhanced by the fact  that  somebody  is
      travelling on documents that indicate asylum proceedings abroad.   The
      statement of Amnesty International is now quite an old  statement,  it
      dates from February 1999 and  we  consider  that  the  information  in
      paragraph 6.102 and 6.101 which reflects the conclusions of the  Fact-
      Finding mission to Turkey  more likely to represent the true state  of
      affairs. Since  the  hearing  we  have  received,  without  objection,
      further material which backs up this view. The report  of  the  German
      immigration authority of July 1999 shows clearly, in  our  view,  that
      para 6.104 is referring only to the situation of a returnee who has no
      travel documents  that  the  authorities  would  consider  valid.  The
      relevant passage, from which 6.104 is taken, is headed:


              "  Undocumented (i.e. travelling on an EU letter  or  similar)
      "

           The report clearly distinguishes such a person  from  a  returnee
      travelling on a valid Turkish  travel  document  who  will  pass  into
      Turkey as set out in para. 6.101 and 6.102.

32.   Further, the April 2004 CIPU report, in reliance  on  the  Netherlands
      Ministry of  Foreign  Affairs  report,  states  at  para  6.241,  that
      returnees on a valid travel document  will  be  checked.  As  we  have
      already found, this check will be on the GBTS. If they are on it  they
      will be detained and questioned. The claimant in this case is  not  at
      all likely to be on it.  Thus, we have concluded that in this case the
      claimant would not be likely to be at any  real  risk  of  persecution
      because of anything that happens to him at Istanbul airport.

33.   Having passed through the airport he would then become a part  of  the
      general population of Turkey.   Of course, he has  had  troubles  with
      the police in the past and it  would  appear,  if  he  were  detained,
      whatever is recorded against him would or might come to the  attention
      of the authorities.    It did when he was last arrested  in  September
      2000, but it is noteworthy that the authorities  seemed  not  to  have
      expressed any particular adverse interest in him on that occasion  and
      that he was released in a day with no charges and having not  suffered
      any maltreatment.

34.   Nearly 4 years  have  elapsed  since  then  and  we  cannot  see  that
      whatever is recorded against his name in Turkey is likely  any  longer
      to lead to him being of  real  risk  of  persecution  were  he  to  be
      unfortunate enough to be  arrested  again.   But  we  would  make  the
      further point that there is no reason to suppose that he  is  at  real
      risk of being detained or arrested again.   Unless there is  something
      about him that alerts the authorities'  attention  to  him  he  is  as
      unlikely to be arrested  or  to  be  detained  as  any  other  Turkish
      citizen.  Certainly, we consider  that  this  would  be  the  position
      outside his home area where he is not generally known as an individual
      with a past.

35.   For all the above reasons we have come to  the  conclusion  that  this
      appeal must be dismissed and that the claimant would not  be  at  real
      risk of persecution were he to be returned to Turkey.
