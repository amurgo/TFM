Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr T Ahmed, of Universal Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Emily Martin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh.  She appealed to the  First-
    tier Tribunal against the decision of the respondent  on  21  May  2012
    refusing her entry clearance to the United Kingdom  as  the  spouse  of
    Mohamed Shamsul Hoque, a British citizen.  The Entry Clearance  Officer
    had refused the application because  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    parties to the  marriage  intended  to  live  together  permanently  as
    husband and wife, or that adequate maintenance or  accommodation  would
    be available.  In the First-tier Tribunal the matter came before  Judge
    Malins.  She heard oral evidence from the  sponsor,  and  examined  the
    documentary evidence.  She also took the view that  the  appellant  had
    failed to establish that  her  relationship  with  the  sponsor  was  a
    genuine  one,  or  that  she  would  be  adequately  accommodated   and
    maintained without recourse to public funds.

 2. The appellant sought permission to appeal to this Tribunal.  Permission
    was granted on the basis that  it  was  arguable  the  judge  had  made
    speculations and had misunderstood the evidence.  In particular, it was
    suggested that the judge ought  not  to  have  considered  whether  the
    marriage was "loving", but  only  whether  it  was  genuine;  and  that
    conclusion reached by the judge about one of  the  documents  going  to
    maintenance  was  one  which,  in  fairness,  the  appellant   or   her
    representatives ought to have the  chance  to  comment  on.   Thus  the
    matter came before us.

 3. We have to say that the judge's determination  causes  us  considerable
    concerns.  She based her findings on a  conclusion  that  the  evidence
    before her was not worthy of credit, giving the following reasons:

        "8.  My Findings: Credibility


                  I did not find the appellant to  be  a  credible  witness
             because there are key sections in all the evidence here,  which
             I am unable to accept.  These I set out below:
             (a)   The Nature of the Marriage
                  I am unable to accept that this marriage subsists in  the
                  way which has been judicially defined because:
                  (i) the sponsor not once told me in oral evidence that he
                       misses his wife     or indeed has  any  feelings  for
                       her.  There is a bare assertion on page 2 of his four
                       page witness  statement  that  "we  are  in  a  close
                       marital relationship as any ordinary couple ..."  yet
                       - the sponsor has not felt moved to  visit  his  wife
                       since the parties married one month after  meeting  -
                       now two years and three months since;
                   (ii)    the sponsor's witness statement also contains the
                       sharp observation "clearly if  our  marriage  is  not
                       subsisting I would have no reason  to  part  with  my
                       hard earned money on a regular  basis",  having  said
                       that he sends remittances to the appellant.  This  is
                       inconsistent with a loving relationship;
                   (iii)    more  crucially,  the  appellant's   immigration
                       history  reflects  adversely   upon   him   in   this
                       particular  appeal  sponsoring  a  spouse  settlement
                       visa;
                         . the Home Office granted  the  sponsor  indefinite
                           leave to remain in 2010 (VAF 8.2.12) which was in
                           fact six years after he lost the very basis  upon
                           which he had entered and then remained in the UK.
                            The sponsor must therefore have made a dishonest
                           application to the Home Office;
                . leave was granted on 14th February 2010;
                         . less than one month later, on 10th May 2010,  the
                           appellant's passport was issued, no doubt  having
                           been applied for immediately;
                         .  around  four  months  after  this,  the  sponsor
                           travelled  to  Bangladesh  to  meet   his   newly
                           arranged second bride.  I note that this marriage
                           was not arranged until after the UK passport  was
                           obtained  rather  than  -  as  might  have   been
                           expected - rather sooner after  his  divorce  six
                           years previously.
                  Looking  at  the  overall  picture  set   out   in   this
                  subparagraph in the round, I am not able to find it  more
                  probable than not, that this marriage  was  unrelated  to
                  the matter of the UK visa and  that  accordingly,  it  is
                  more probable than not, that the marriage is not now (and
                  never was) "subsisting" in the necessary sense.
             (b)   The appellant's  employer  is  claimed  to  be  Rosehurry
                  Limited in the application.  However -
                   (i) I am unable to accept the veracity of  the  purported
                       "notice of coding" from HMRC in evidence as,  amongst
                       a number of textual infelicities,  the  body  of  the
                       Notice  contains  seven   references   to   ROSEHURRY
                       LIMITED.  Notices of coding do not refer to employers
                       in the way presented;
                   (ii)    the notice of coding is not signed in  the  space
                       provided;
                   (iii)   the notice of coding fails to give a  fax  number
                       and gives the claimed telephone number  opposite  the
                       word "Phone" - not  "Telephone"  or  the  more  usual
                       abbreviation in such communications "Tel";
                   (iv)    the tax code given in the  notice  of  coding  is
                       entirely different from that given in the P45 put  in
                       evidence which is dated only six months later;
                   (v) the appellant has put in evidence  nineteen  separate
                       pay slips.  Each one shows a gross income of  �182.40
                       and a net income of �169.59 to the same penny in both
                       cases.  Each of the nineteen  pay  slips  records  30
                       hours exactly as having been worked.
                        Such  uniformity  is  not  plausible.    Pay   slips
                       frequently  vary.   Most  employees  work   disparate
                       numbers of hours a week - hence the  point  of  being
                       paid an hourly rate in each of the nineteen weeks.  I
                       reject  the  evidence  that  the   appellant   worked
                       precisely 30 hours in each of nineteen weeks;
                   (vi)    if the appellant is stated to be paid by BACS  by
                       definition, this will show in  the  appellant's  bank
                       statements.  No such credits are shown  in  the  bank
                       statements in evidence.
                  For the above reasons and in the above  circumstances,  I
                  reject the appellant's evidence to have been employed  as
                  claimed.


             (c)   Accommodation
                   (i) the property register at the Land  Registry  and  the
                       copy tenancy agreement both show the  owners  of  the
                       property as Shilpi Begum and Rubia Begum;  however
                   (ii)    the copy accommodation letter  sent  to  the  ECO
                       stating that the appellant can be accommodated at the
                       given address, purports to come from Bilal Ahmed  and
                       Shilpi Begum as occupiers of the property;
                   (iii)   the surveyors' letter  to  the  ECO  in  evidence
                       failed to note the names of the owners  or  occupiers
                       of the premises.   It  does  however  state  that  in
                       January  2012,  the  property  was  occupied  by  the
                       sponsor, two other  adults  and  three  children  and
                       comprised  three  double  bedrooms,  a   kitchen,   a
                       bathroom and toilet, and one living room.


                  The evidence here is unsatisfactory and in any event, the
                  appellant and sponsor would have to share a bathroom  and
                  kitchen with another  family.   In  those  circumstances,
                  they would probably be entitled to  seek  rehousing  from
                  the council.


             (d)   The Sponsor's Previous Marriage
                  The fact that the sponsor was unable to state one word as
                  to why his marriage to  his  first  wife  in  respect  of
                  which, he himself had  emigrated,  had  failed,  detracts
                  from his overall credibility.


        9.   Conclusions


              The very detailed reasons which I have set out  in  making  my
             credibility finding, have in fact taken  my  determination  one
             step further, as they themselves, must be determinative of  the
             result of the appeal.
              By a wide margin, I am  unable  to  find  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities, that the marriage between the  sponsor  and  the
             appellant is subsisting.  I am also unable to be satisfied upon
             the issues of maintenance and accommodation,  although  in  the
             case of the latter, mindful of the low threshold, the matter is
             more finely balanced.
              I find that the ECO was  entirely  correct  in  this  decision
             under the law and the Immigration Rules and  that  furthermore,
             he gave the application full consideration  in  every  respect.
             Like him, I am unable to be satisfied under paragraph 281(iii),
             (iv) and (v) of the Immigration Rules.
              As I have found there to be no subsisting marriage, Article  8
             can have no application.  Both the  limbs  of  the  appellant's
             appeal must fail.


        10.  Rider
              I should mention here in the interests of justice that  it  is
             to be hoped that the UK Border Agency will  closely  look  into
             the basis upon which the sponsor obtained his UK citizenship in
             2010: whether or not it was properly based upon his having been
             granted indefinite leave to  remain  at  a  time  when  he  was
             married".

 4. There are demonstrable errors under each of the first three heads.   So
    far as concerns the nature of the marriage,  the  judge  made  a  clear
    error of fact of  paragraph  8.   As  the  documents  before  her  made
    perfectly clear, the sponsor was not granted indefinite leave to remain
    in 2010: he was granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain  in  2002.   The
    conclusions as to the Sponsor's conduct that she drew from her  mistake
    were falsely damaging to him and clearly  influential  in  her  overall
    conclusions as well as the (unmentioned) "Rider".

 5. So far as concerns the evidence  of  maintenance,  sub-paragraphs  (i)-
    (iii) appear to depend on her own expertise in relation to a notice  of
    coding.  We do not know why she drew the conclusion she did: the notice
    of coding does not look different from notices of coding with which  we
    as taxpayers are familiar; and we  think  there  is  a  great  deal  of
    justice in  the  suggestion  that,  given  that  an  issue  as  to  the
    genuineness of the document had arisen in her mind, she should not have
    reached the conclusion she  did  without  allowing  the  matter  to  be
    properly investigated.  If she did have expertise in notices of coding,
    it is surprising that she drew conclusion (iv): the reason why the  tax
    code given in the notice of coding  is  entirely  different  from  that
    given in the P45 dated only six months later is that the P45 refers  to
    a different tax year.

 6. So far as concerns accommodation, the final sentiment  in  the  judge's
    observations appears to be an assumption she makes about the law.   Her
    apparent doubts about the owners and occupiers of  the  property  could
    have been resolved by a study of a letter from  the  owners,  dated  24
    January 2013, which was before her.  We should say, incidentally,  that
    we have no  idea  what  the  judge  meant  by  referring  to  the  "low
    threshold" in relation to accommodation.  The standard  of  proof  that
    she should have been applying was that of the balance of probabilities.



 7. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that  permission  to  appeal
    was sought and granted.  The  determination  is  riddled  with  errors.
    They are errors of law because they  demonstrate  that  the  judge  was
    failing to do her job properly.

 8. We have considered the evidence again.  There  was  no  application  to
    adduce further evidence before us.  As we indicated at the hearing, our
    view is that the evidence in relation to maintenance and  accommodation
    was of a nature that would have caused the appeal to  be  dismissed  in
    any event.

 9. In relation to maintenance, there was  a  clear  conflict  of  evidence
    between the sponsor's account of his alleged wages, and  the  documents
    supporting it.  The Entry Clearance Officer's reasons for refusal read,
    in part, as follows:

           "Your sponsor claims to  work  for  Rosehurry  Ltd  earning  net
           income of �169.59 per  week.   You  have  shown  wage  slips  as
           evidence of your sponsor's employment.   I  note  that  the  pay
           slips show it paid by BACS however the bank statements you  have
           submitted show no deposits from Rosehurry by the BACS method.  I
           also note that your sponsor makes regular deposits  of  �182.00.
           These  deposits  are  more  than  your  sponsor  is  paid.    No
           explanation has been given to demonstrate the  origin  of  these
           funds".

10. Those concerns remain unanswered.  Without wanting to  open  again  the
    question of the reliability of the sponsor's tax documents, it  is,  to
    say the least, very surprising to see that a sponsor who claims  to  be
    paid just over �182.00 gross per week, amounting to  �169.59  net,  and
    whose employer records that he is paid by the BACS, should not be  able
    to provide other evidence of any payments of �169.59, but instead gives
    evidence of manual deposits of almost exactly the gross amount  of  his
    income.  The Entry Clearance Officer's doubts about the credibility  of
    this evidence were entirely justified, and were clearly expressed.   As
    the judge's determination makes clear, those doubts remained by the end
    of the hearing, and they remain still.  There is simply no good  reason
    why the evidence of the appellant and the sponsor on this point  should
    be regarded as credible: it certainly cannot all be true.

11.  The  same  comment  appears  to  us  to  be  merited  in  relation  to
    accommodation.  The evidence adduced with the purpose  of  showing  the
    genuineness of the sponsor's access to accommodation proves  too  much:
    it is a lease by which he is granted a tenancy of the  entire  property
    at which he lives.  That is wholly inconsistent with the evidence  that
    he has one room there.  Again, they cannot both be true.  The  document
    that has legal effect (the lease) appears to show that the evidence  of
    the sponsor and his alleged landlord's is not correct.

12. This appeal cannot succeed on the evidence before the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, the First-tier Tribunal or us, and we set  aside  the  judge's
    determination, including her findings on the nature  of  the  marriage,
    and her "Rider", and substitute a determination dismissing  the  appeal
    because the appellant cannot meet  the  maintenance  and  accommodation
    requirements of  the  rules.   In  that  context,  and  because  a  new
    application may well be made, we reach no conclusion on the  nature  of
    the  marriage  or  the  intention  of  the  parties  to  live  together
    permanently as husband and wife.  The First-tier Tribunal's conclusions
    on that issue have been set aside, and whatever view we  reached  would
    not affect the outcome of the appeal.

13. For the reasons we have given, the appellant's appeal is dismissed.
