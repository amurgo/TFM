                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Not represented
For the appellant:     Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Said  Safi,  date  of  birth  1.1.93,  is  a  citizen  of
    Afghanistan.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Somal promulgated 28.8.15, allowing, on human
    rights grounds, the claimant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 15.12.14, to refuse his asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    17.8.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Kimnell  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.9.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 3.11.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. There was no appeal or cross appeal against the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal to dismiss the appeal on  both  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection grounds and thus those decisions must stand as made.

 6. For the reasons set out below I found such error of law in  the  making
    of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the  decision  of
    Judge Somal to allow the appeal on human rights grounds should  be  set
    aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be remade.

 7. First, having dismissed the asylum and humanitarian protection  claims,
    Judge Somal proceeded to consider article 8 ECHR on  the  Razgar  five-
    stage test, without any reference to the Immigration Rules in  relation
    to private and family life under Appendix FM and paragraph  276ADE.  It
    is now trite law that any consideration of private and/or  family  life
    outside the Rules under article 8 ECHR should  be  viewed  through  the
    lens of the Rules, which form the Secretary  of  State's  proportionate
    response to such claims. The judge has identified no compelling reasons
    to  consider  human  rights  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  and  not
    considered whether there are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  continuing
    family life outside the UK. For these reasons  alone  the  decision  is
    flawed and cannot stand.

 8. The reasoning of the First-tier Tribunal  in  allowing  the  appeal  on
    human rights decision is difficult to understand. Judge  Somal  appears
    to have focused on the claim that Mr Safi was in a relationship with  a
    Czech citizen. At �28 it is stated that she entered the UK at age 15 as
    a dependant of her parents and that her  father  is  exercising  Treaty
    rights in the UK as a worker, and that all her immediate family are  in
    the UK. At �31 Judge Somal stated that the claimant's partner is an EEA
    national who has a strong bond with her own parents who are  exercising
    Treaty rights in the UK. For reasons unclear  in  the  decision,  Judge
    Somal considered it was not a viable option  for  the  family  unit  to
    relocate to  the  Czech  Republic.  At  �32  the  judge  stated,  "This
    appellant and his partner are a young couple with two children with  no
    obvious ties or reasons to live in Czech Republic." At  �33  the  judge
    further stated, "His partner is an EEA national who has  lived  outside
    Czech Republic for many years and  would  be  unable  to  exercise  her
    rights as an EEA national in the UK where she lives  with  her  support
    network of immediate family nearby." I fail  to  understand  this  last
    sentence; it makes no sense at all.

 9. Judge Somal appears to have confused and  conflated  the  human  rights
    claim with the Treaty rights of an EEA national. The fact is  that  the
    claimant's partner, although a Czech national, is not exercising Treaty
    rights in the UK and thus has no entitlement to remain  in  the  UK  at
    all. Neither the claimant nor his partner  have  any  legal  status  or
    right to reside in the UK. No cogent reasons have been identified as to
    why the family could not  continue  their  family  life  in  the  Czech
    Republic, where the claimant's partner is  entitled  to  reside.  Judge
    Somal appears to have used article 8 ECHR as a dispensing provision  to
    find the claimant should have leave to remain  without  any  basis  for
    doing so. This is not the case of a partner seeking to remain in the UK
    with a British citizen or person with settled status in  the  UK.  Just
    because his partner is an EEA national does not confer  any  rights  to
    either of them or their children to remain in the UK. As  I  understand
    it, the claimant was  originally  granted  discretionary  leave  as  an
    unaccompanied minor to remain in the UK for a period of  6  months.  He
    has now been here illegally for some 8 years. It is difficult to see on
    what  basis  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge   found   it   would   be
    disproportionate to require the claimant to  leave  or  the  family  to
    continue their family life in the Czech Republic.

10. It follows that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  flawed  for
    manifest error of law and cannot stand.

11. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the  Upper  Tribunal.  The  errors  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions
    from those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of
    the issues in the appeal.

12. In all the circumstances, I remit the  human  rights  decision  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal on the basis  that  this  is  a  case  which  falls
    squarely within the Senior President's Practice Statement at  paragraph
    7.2. The effect of the error has been to deprive the parties of a  fair
    hearing and that the nature or extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding
    which is necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal  with
    cases fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find
    that it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal
    to determine afresh the appeal in  relation  to  human  rights  grounds
    only.

Conclusions:

13. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision allowing the appeal on human rights
    grounds should be set aside. The unappealed  decision  to  dismiss  the
    appeal on asylum and humanitarian grounds must stand.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal  to  be  remade,  preserving   the   unappealed
                    decisions  to  dismiss  the   appeal   on   asylum   and
                    humanitarian protection grounds.

Consequential Directions

14. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal sitting at  Stoke  on
    Trent;

15. The decision to dismiss the appeal  on  both  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection grounds is preserved. The  sole  issue  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal will be private and family life on human rights grounds;

16. The estimated length of hearing is 3 hours;

17. Interpreters will be required in Pashto and Czech;



Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
