Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Harding, Counsel, instructed by J McCarthy
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in this case is a citizen  of  Nigeria  who  appeals  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, promulgated on 2  March  2017,  to
    dismiss the appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal  on  22
    October 2015 to grant further leave to remain on human rights  grounds.



 2. The appellant appeals with permission on the following grounds:

      1) that the judge erred on the Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] 1 WLR 1402;

      2) that the judge erred in his approach to insurmountable obstacles.

Error of Law Discussion

 3. Mr Harding in his submissions helpfully summarised  the  existing  case
    law in relation to Chikwamba and submitted that  the  judge  failed  to
    adequately address this at [38] and [48] of the decision  and  reasons,
    including in finding at [48] that he was not persuaded by the Chikwamba
    point as there are "no children of the marriage and the  appellant  has
    broken the immigration law quite egregiously".   Mr  Harding  submitted
    that the Chikwamba  point  only  arose  when  someone  was  in  the  UK
    illegally and Chikwamba therefore  was  predicated  on  the  law  being
    broken.

 4. At paragraphs 25 and 26 of Chikwamba the House of  Lords  set  out  the
    approach and at  paragraph  44  Lord  Brown  found  that  it  would  be
    comparatively rare, certainly in family cases involving children,  that
    it would be proportionate for the appellant to apply from  abroad.   It
    was on this basis that he submitted  that  the  judge  had  misdirected
    himself.  However I am not satisfied that there is any error  disclosed
    in the judge taking into consideration that this was a  case  that  did
    not involve children as a relevant factor as to why Chikwamba would not
    apply.

 5. Mr Harding relied on the case of Treebhowan; Hayat v SSHD  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ  1054  which  concluded  at  paragraph  30(a)  that  the   relevant
    principles in applying Chikwamba included as follows:

         "Where an applicant  who  does  not  have  lawful  entry  clearance
         pursues an Article 8 claim, a dismissal of a  claim  on  procedural
         ground that the policy requires that the applicant should have made
         the application from his home state may (but not necessarily  will)
         constitute a disruption of family and private  life  sufficient  to
         engage  Article  8,  particularly  where  children  are   adversely
         affected.

         Again, I am of the view that this highlights that the judge made no
         error in taking into consideration that there were no  children  in
         this case.

 6. At 30(b) of Hayat:

         "Where  Article  8  is  engaged  it  will  be  a   disproportionate
         interference with family and private life to enforce such a  policy
         unless, to use the language of Sullivan LJ,  there  is  a  sensible
         reason for doing so."

    30(c) goes on to find that:

         "whether it is sensible to enforce that policy will necessarily  be
         fact sensitive; Lord Brown identified certain potentially  relevant
         factors in Chikwamba.  They will include the prospective length and
         degree of disruption of family life and where other members of  the
         family are settled in the UK.

    30 (d):

         "Where Article 8  is  engaged  there  is  no  sensible  reason  for
         enforcing the  policy  the  decision  maker  should  determine  the
         Article 8 claim on its substantive merits,  having  regard  to  all
         material factors notwithstanding the applicant has no lawful  entry
         clearance".

 7. Mr Harding further relied on Agyarko v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department [2017]  UKSC  11.  Paragraph  51  of  Agyarko  endorsed  the
    Chikwamba approach as follows:

         "If on the other hand an applicant - even if  residing  in  the  UK
         unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted leave to enter, at
         least if an application were made from outside the UK,  then  there
         might be no public interest in his or her removal.   The  point  is
         illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba v Secretary of  State  for
         the Home Department".

 8. Mr Harding submitted that  the  question  of  certainty  has  not  been
    adequately resolved.  He submitted that if  we  assumed  certain  means
    every real prospect of success it was his submission that this is  what
    the Supreme Court had in mind.

 9. In the case of Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2016]
    UKSC 60 at paragraph 34 again the approach in Chikwamba was endorsed as
    follows:

         "For example where a person was residing in the  UK  unlawfully  at
         the time when the relationship  was  formed  but  would  have  been
         permitted to reside here lawfully if an application was  made  from
         outside the UK, the latter point  should  be  taken  into  account.
         That  example  illustrates  how  the  distinction  between  settled
         migrants and aliens residing in the host country unlawfully may be,
         in some situations, of limited practical importance when translated
         into the context  of  the  UK  immigration  law:  see  for  example
         Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] 1 WLR 1402".

10. Mr Harding also relied  on  the  Upper  Tribunal  case  of  R  (on  the
    application of Chen) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    (Appendix FM Chikwamba- temporary  separation  -  proportionality)  IJR
    [2015] UKUT 189 (IAC) which concluded (as summarised in the head  note)
    as follows:

         "...

         There may be cases where there are no insurmountable  obstacles  to
         family life being enjoyed outside the  UK  but  where  a  temporary
         separation to enable an individual to make an application for entry
         clearance may be disproportionate.  In all cases it will be for the
         individual to place before the Secretary  of  State  evidence  that
         such temporary separation will  interfere  disproportionately  with
         protected rights.  It will not be enough to rely  solely  upon  the
         case law concerning Chikwamba v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2008] UKHL 40".

11. Mr Harding relied in particular on paragraph 29, where it was  accepted
    that the Court of Appeal did not suggest at paragraph  30(a)  of  Hyatt
    that Chikwamba was an exceptional case on  its  facts,  as  opposed  to
    being an example  of  one  of  those  very  rare  cases  where  it  was
    appropriate for the Court of  Appeal  to  make  substantive  Article  8
    decision itself instead of remitting the case back to the Tribunal

12. Mr Harding submitted that  Chen  was  somewhat  opaque  as  to  whether
    Chikwamba applies if it is not certain that  entry  clearance  will  be
    granted and it was his submission that this was a case where it  would;
    the appellant's wife was earning �38,000 at the time of the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision and was earning more now and it was accepted that the
    relationship was genuine  and  subsisting.   Looking  at  [48]  of  the
    decision and reasons it was submitted that the  judge  had  misdirected
    himself in relation to the lack of children  of  the  relationship  and
    took into account that the appellant had breached the  law  whereas  it
    was submitted he did not properly apply the Chen approach.

13. It was also submitted it was  incorrect  of  the  permission  judge  to
    conclude that the Chikwamba point was irrelevant as it  was  not  shown
    that there were insurmountable obstacles to family life, as  the  Upper
    Tribunal specifically found in Chen, that  there  may  be  cases  where
    there are no insurmountable obstacles where a temporary separation  may
    still be disproportionate.

14. It was also submitted that when considering very serious hardship  that
    the judge ought to have considered how far the appellant's family would
    fall in that this was a family where the appellant's partner owned  her
    own home and was earning �38,000  plus  bonuses  at  the  time  of  the
    decision and her career was improving and indeed it  was  now  �50,000.
    She would not be able to pay her mortgage and would lose her  home  and
    on an objective analysis it was submitted would establish that this was
    disproportionate.  Mr Harding also submitted that the judge should have
    considered a balance  sheet  approach  including  in  relation  to  the
    appellant's health whereas at [37] the judge only  looked  at  a  small
    part of the evidence when  considering  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles.  It was submitted the judge did not take  into  account  all
    the factors including the appellant's partner losing her  job  and  her
    house.

Error of Law Decision

15. I am not satisfied that any error of law has been disclosed.  Although,
    as summarised above, Mr Harding submitted in some considerable,  detail
    that there was an error in the manner in which  the  judge  dealt  with
    Chikwamba including in taking into account the  appellant's  illegality
    and that they did not have children as I have already  indicated  there
    was no error in taking into account the issue of children.

16. Even if the judge erred in relying on the appellant's poor  immigration
    history and not citing all the factors including the potential delay in
    entry clearance, such is not material.   I am not satisfied that it has
    been shown that this is a case where there was any degree of  certainty
    that entry clearance would be granted, were the appellant to return  to
    Nigeria and apply for entry clearance.  Although Mr  Harding  submitted
    that Chen was opaque on this point, at paragraph 39 the Upper  Tribunal
    found that:

         "... if it is shown by an individual (the burden being upon him  or
         her) that an application for entry clearance from abroad  would  be
         granted and that  there  would  be  significant  interference  with
         family life by temporary removal, the weight to be accorded to  the
         formal requirement of obtaining entry clearance is reduced".

17. Although Mr Harding referred to  level  of  the  sponsor's  salary,  it
    cannot be said that it was shown before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (or
    indeed before  me)  that  an  entry  clearance  application  'would  be
    granted'.  I am also of the view that the additional test 'there  would
    be significant interference with family life by temporary removal'  was
    further  not  satisfied.   Whilst  Chen  confirms   that   there   were
    circumstances  where  a  return  to  seek  entry   clearance   may   be
    disproportionate, even if there are no insurmountable obstacles, it was
    not shown that this was such a case.  There was  no  error  in  finding
    that Chikwamba did not assist this appellant.  It must be  implicit  in
    that finding, given the earlier conclusions of the Tribunal,  that  the
    lack of insurmountable obstacles was a relevant factor.

18. There is therefore no material error in the judge's  consideration  and
    the conclusion that was  ultimately  reached.   The  lack  of  anything
    approaching certainty, albeit that the appellant's partner earns  above
    the income threshold; that is not the only factor to be considered,  in
    relation to any prospective entry clearance is fatal to  the  Chikwamba
    point.  Similarly the lack of adequate evidence before  the  First-tier
    tribunal that a temporary separation  would  result  in  a  significant
    interference with family life supports the conclusion that any error of
    approach by the First-tier Tribunal could not be said to be material.

19. In relation to insurmountable obstacles, although  the  judge  did  not
    specifically cite each  and  every  element  that  he  had  taken  into
    consideration, neither was he required to do so.  A fair reading of the
    decision indicates that  the  judge  had  in  mind  all  the  evidence,
    including the circumstances of the appellant's partner and that she had
    never been to Nigeria.  The judge carefully noted the appellant's  case
    and set out the  evidence  of  both  parties  including  their  witness
    statements and oral evidence.

20. The judge specifically noted, at [37], that the appellant's wife "has a
    degree as a marketing expert and that is a very portable skill.  It  is
    very well paid".  It is evident therefore that the judge was  aware  of
    the salary that the appellant's wife was earning and there was no error
    in finding that there would not be insurmountable  obstacles  including
    in  taking  into  consideration  that  both  parties  would   have   an
    opportunity to obtain work including that the  appellant  could  obtain
    legal work in Nigeria whereas he could not  in  the  UK.   It  was  the
    judge's findings that this could give them a higher standard of  living
    than they currently enjoy in the UK.

21. The judge provided adequate reasons for the conclusions reached and  it
    cannot be said that there was any irrationality in those reasons.   The
    fact  that  the  judge  erroneously  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules as  well  as  on  Human  Rights  grounds,  where  the
    appellant only had a right of appeal on Human Rights grounds is  not  a
    material error and such was not pursued before me. I am  not  satisfied
    that any error has been disclosed.

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not disclose  an  error  of
    law such that it should be set aside and shall stand.


No anonymity direction was sought or is made.
