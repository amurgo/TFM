Representation:
For the Secretary of State (Appellant in the Upper Tribunal): Ms Brocklesby-
Weller
For the Claimant: Miss Fisher (Counsel)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge James promulgated on the 19th July 2015, following
      a hearing on the 29th May 2015, in which he allowed the appeal against
      a refusal to extend the Appellant's discretionary leave, on Article  3
      and Article 8 grounds.


   2. Permission to appeal has been granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Grant-Hutchinson on the 14th July 2015, in which she  noted  that  the
      Secretary of State  was  only  seeking  to  challenge  the  Article  8
      findings, but that it was arguable the  Judge  had  erred  in  law  by
      failing to consider the requirements of Appendix FM and had failed  to
      properly consider the public  interest  in  conducting  the  balancing
      exercise by virtue of Article 1F (a) and (c) and by  failing  to  give
      little weight to the Appellant's private life in terms of Section  117
      B (5).



   3. Within the Grounds of Appeal it is argued by the  Secretary  of  State
      that the Appellant is excluded from the refugee Convention  by  virtue
      of Article 1F (a) and that  the  Appellant's  appeal  was  allowed  on
      Article 8 grounds, but that the Secretary  of  State  only  sought  to
      challenge the findings in respect of Article 8. It is  further  argued
      that the Judge had failed to consider the requirements of Appendix  FM
      and further that the Judge's assessment  of  Article  8  is  therefore
      flawed as no consideration has been given or weight  attached  to  the
      fact that the Appellant failed to meet the suitability requirements of
      Appendix FM by virtue of his exclusion from the Refugee Convention. It
      was further argued that  the  Judge  has  incorrectly  considered  the
      public interest grounds of Section 117B of Part 5 of the  Nationality,
      Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in that he  failed  to  attach  little
      weight to the Appellant's private  life  established  with  precarious
      status and that the Judge had failed to take into account the fact the
      Appellant was excluded from the Refugee  Convention  when  determining
      whether  or  not  the  Appellant's  removal  from  the  UK  would   be
      disproportionate and had overlooked the public  interest  in  removing
      those excluded from the Refugee Convention under Article 1F (a).


   4. Within the Rule 24 Reply, which was filed and served on the 29th  July
      2015, but which was not contained within  the  file,  to  which  I  am
      grateful to Miss Fisher for providing me  with  another  copy  of  the
      same, it is argued that Section 117 B (5) did not mean that the  Judge
      should attach little weight to the Claimant's  family  life  with  his
      partner and that the subsection  only  applies  to  private  life  not
      family life. It is further argued that even if Section 117B  militated
      against the Claimant in the assessment of proportionality,  the  Judge
      was entitled to balance such matters against the lengthy delay of 7  ï¿½
      years on the part of the Appellant  considering  the  application  for
      further leave. It is further argued that in respect  of  the  argument
      that the Judge failed to attach  weight  to  the  public  interest  in
      removing those who have been excluded from the Refugee Convention,  no
      authority had been submitted in support thereof, but that the decision
      in  respect  thereof  could  not  alter  the  outcome  of  the  lawful
      proportionality exercise in circumstances  where  in  respect  of  the
      Claimant whose claim  that  if  returned  he  would  be  subjected  to
      treatment contrary to Article 3 ECHR upon return had been accepted.


   5. It is further argued within the Rule 24 reply that the Judge failed to
      consider the Claimant's entitlement to protection  under  the  Refugee
      Convention and that although the Judge directed himself  that  he  was
      not pursuing an appeal against refusal to grant  asylum,  he  had  not
      considered the submissions about exclusion which are recorded  at  [51
      to 53] of the determination and that the very  first  Tribunal  Judge,
      Immigration Judge Hawden-Beal who had considered the Claimant's  first
      appeal in 2006 had erred in finding that the Claimant had committed  a
      crime against peace and so fell for exclusion under Article 1F (a)  of
      the Convention.  It  was  argued  that  although  Judge  Hawden-Beal's
      determination of the facts was the starting point for the  assessment,
      the Tribunal was not stopped per rem judicatam  from  considering  the
      1951 Convention following the case of Mubu [2000] UKUT  398  and  that
      the Judge should had properly  considered  the  Claimant's  appeal  on
      asylum grounds.



   6. Although after having taken instructions, this Ms  Brocklesby-Weller's
      primary position on behalf of the Secretary of State was that the Rule
      24 notice should not be used as a means of conducting  a  cross-appeal
      and reliance was placed upon the Upper Tribunal decision  of  e.g.  EG
      and NG (UT Rule 17;withdrawal; Rule  24:scope  Ethiopia)  [2013]  UKUT
      00143 she argued that the  Upper  Tribunal  in  that  case  had  found
      specifically that "a party that seeks to persuade the  Upper  Tribunal
      to replace a decision of the First-tier Tribunal with a decision  that
      would  make  a  material  difference  to  one  of  the  parties  needs
      permission  to  appeal.  The  Upper  Tribunal  cannot   entertain   an
      application purporting to be under Rule 24 for  permission  to  appeal
      unless  the  First-tier  Tribunal  has  been  asked  in  writing   for
      permission to appeal and has either refused it or  declined  to  admit
      the application". In reply, Miss Fisher sought to initially argue that
      the point made in respect of Article 1F was a Robinson obvious  point,
      such that it could be argued before the Upper Tribunal.



   7. However, upon reflection,  Miss  Fisher  on  behalf  of  the  Claimant
      conceded that the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  James  did
      contain a material error of law in terms of his  failure  to  consider
      the effect, if any, of Article 1F in  the  Article  8  proportionality
      assessment. It was agreed between  the  parties  that  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge's  findings  in  respect  of  the  genuineness  of  the
      Claimant and his partner's relationship and the nature and  extent  of
      their relationship should be preserved, as also should the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge's findings in respect of Article 3, but that it was  in
      the interests of justice for the matter to be  remitted  back  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal for a rehearing of the proportionality  issue,  in
      light of the issue in respect of Article 1F.



   8. It was further agreed between the parties that as First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge James had not actually made any findings in respect  of  Article
      1F, that the First-tier Tribunal upon  considering  the  case  at  the
      remitted hearing, would have to deal with  the  Appellant's  arguments
      that the Claimant was not in fact excluded from being  able  to  claim
      asylum under the Refugee Convention by the virtue of  Article  1F  and
      that the questions as to the extent to which the  First-tier  Tribunal
      should accept the findings of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Hawden-Beal
      from 2006 and as to the  extent  to  which  Article  1F  actually  was
      engaged, would have to be considered. It was also agreed  between  the
      parties that if the First-tier Tribunal found that Article 1F was  not
      engaged having considered the Appellant's submissions in this  regard,
      then in affect the Claimant's asylum appeal should also be dealt  with
      at that First-tier Tribunal rehearing.



   9. However, it was further agreed between the parties that this would not
      affect the Claimant's entitlement under Article 3, or the findings  in
      respect of the extent and nature of his relationship with his  partner
      for the purpose of Article 8. It  was,  however,  agreed  between  the
      parties that the Article 1F consideration should be dealt with by  the
      First-tier Tribunal upon the rehearing, and this could make a material
      outcome to the decision, given that if the Claimant is  excluded  from
      claiming under the Convention as a result of Article 1F, he would only
      ever be given 6 months leave at any one time.



Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge James, as has been agreed  between
the parties, does contain a material error of law and  is  set  aside,  save
that the First-tier Tribunal Judge's findings and  decision  on  Article  3,
and  his  findings  in  respect  of  the  genuineness  and  nature  of   the
relationship between the Claimant and his partner are preserved;
The matter is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for rehearing  before
any First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge James.
