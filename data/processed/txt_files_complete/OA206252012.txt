                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a determination
        of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Sommerville  promulgated  on   5th
        February 2014 in which he allowed the appeal against the refusal of
        entry clearance for the purposes of settlement by  Miss  Kaur  with
        her father in the United Kingdom.


     2. Miss Kaur is a citizen of India born on 24th January 1995. The date
        of decision is  27th  September  2012.  The  sponsor  attended  the
        hearing and gave evidence. Judge Sommerville sets out his  findings
        from paragraphs 12 of the determination. He found the sponsor to be
        a truthful witness. It was found Miss Kaur lives  with  her  mother
        and was at the date of the application an 18-year-old  young  woman
        whose mother would have been involved in  certain  aspects  of  her
        life and that following TD an exceptional case  would  have  to  be
        shown  [15].   The  Judge  then  made  the  following  findings  in
        paragraphs 16 and 17 of the determination:


     16.  However, I propose not to follow  TD  because  I  note  that  that
     decision is now almost 8 years old and in the  intervening  period  the
     world has changed.  In those 8 years  there  has  been  an  exponential
     growth in communication  technology.  The  appellant  and  the  sponsor
   have been able to  take  advantage  of  mobile  phone  technology  to  an
   extent which was not so when TD was decided.


     17.  I believe that the time has come for this  Tribunal  to  recognise
   that by             means of mobile phones and Skype a parent  and  child
   who are                 separated by continents  can  in  effect  have  a
   relationship which is            almost as strong and influential  as  if
   they were living together. This           is particularly  so,  as  here,
   where  the  "absent"  parent  has  retained               strong   family
   connections and there is a culture of  strong  family              values
   which  are  upheld  by  the  head  of  the  family  (usually  but  by  no
   means   always,   the   father).     By    these    modern    means    of
   communication  the  sponsor  has  maintained  his  position  as  head  of
   the family and as such  I  find  that  he  has  in  fact  exercised  sole
     responsibility for the appellant.


     3. In relation to the maintenance issue Judge Sommerville records that
        the Presenting Officer accepted that the sponsor earned  �20,000  a
        year, that the minimum level required to meet the 'Social Security'
        benefit levels  is  �124.32  per  week  and  accordingly  that  the
        sponsor's income exceeded the required  minimum  level  of  funding
        [18].



Error of law finding


     4. I find Judge Sommerville has made legal errors in the determination
        material to his decision to  allow  the  appeal  and  now  give  my
        reasons.


     5. The Entry Clearance Officer was not  satisfied  that  the  UK-based
        sponsor has sole responsibility for  Miss  Kaur's  upbringing  (297
        (ie)) or that  the  sponsor  was  in  receipt  of  the  income  and
        employment claimed, leading to it being said that Miss Kaur had not
        proved that she could be  maintained  without  recourse  to  public
        funds (297 (v).


     6. Judge Sommerville correctly identified that the relevant case  when
        assessing sole responsibility is  TD  (Paragraph  297(i)(e):  "sole
        responsibility") Yemen  [2006]  UKAIT  00049.   In  this  case  the
        Tribunal said that "Sole responsibility" is a factual matter to  be
        decided upon all the evidence.  Where one parent is not involved in
        the child's  upbringing  because  he  (or  she)  had  abandoned  or
        abdicated responsibility, the issue may arise between the remaining
        parent and others who have day-to-day care  of  the  child  abroad.
        The test is whether the parent has continuing control and direction
        over the child's upbringing, including  making  all  the  important
        decisions in the child's life.  However,  where  both  parents  are
        involved in a child's upbringing, it will be exceptional  that  one
        of them will have "sole responsibility".


     7. It must have been accepted by Judge  Sommerville  on  the  evidence
        that the sponsor did not have sole responsibility for in  paragraph
        15 he refers to the need for  an  exceptional  case  to  be  shown,
        notwithstanding his later contradictory finding  that  the  sponsor
        had sole responsibility [17].


     8. The Judge then appears to attempt to circumvent this requirement by
        justifying not following TD which is a  reported  determination  of
        the  tribunal.  It  is  not  a  determination  based  upon  country
        conditions that may have changed significantly after  a  period  of
        eight years but a case that sets out guidance on the approach to be
        taken when  assessing  whether  the  facts  of  a  particular  case
        establish that the necessary test  has  been  met.  The  fact  that
        technology has moved on and there are now more  advanced  means  of
        communication than may have been  available  at  the  date  TD  was
        decided, although it has not been shown that Skype and  other  such
        means of communication were not available in 2006, did not  entitle
        the Judge to depart from such guidance. Whether  responsibility  is
        shared  or  exercised  by  one  parent   or   whether   exceptional
        circumstances exist, is a question of fact. The existence of modern
        means of communication may prove the ability  to  maintain  contact
        between the absent parent and the child but the important  question
        the Judge  should  have  asked  is  whether  the  nature  of  those
        communications and other events that are  relevant  to  this  child
        proved the sponsor had sole responsibility or satisfied the test of
        exceptionality.  I find that the Judge has erred in departing  from
        the guidance in TD without justification for doing so  and  without
        giving  adequate  reasons  for  this  course  of  action   in   the
        determination.


     9. I also find the Judge materially erred in concluding  in  paragraph
        18 that a concession was made where there is  no  evidence  of  any
        such concession. The income support figure provided by the Judge is
        incorrect  as  the  correct  figure  is  �210.03  per  week.    The
        Presenting Officers note of the hearing  indicates  that  she  only
        accepted that the sponsor has an income of �12,000 per annum  which
        is less than the �14,000 required  to  satisfy  the  minimum  level
        required.


    10. I also note the finding by the Judge that Miss Kaur was an 18  year
        old living with her mother at the date of the application which  is
        also factually incorrect as she was 17. Had she been 18  she  would
        have not been able to apply by this route in any event.


    11. I set the determination aside although the findings  regarding  the
        nature  of  the  relationship,  the  means  of  communication,  and
        sponsors immigration history shall be preserved findings.

Discussion



    12. In proceeding to remake the decision oral evidence was  heard  from
        the sponsor Mr Singh and all available  documents  considered.   He
        submitted a number of additional  documents  regarding  his  income
        which is derived from his work as a  preacher  and  rental  income,
        although  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  the   evidence   does   not
        substantiate his claim to receive an income of a  sufficient  level
        to enable Miss Kaur to succeed under the Rules.


    13. Mr Smart also raised the question of adequacy of  accommodation  as
        the sponsor's evidence  was  that  the  property  he  lives  in  is
        occupied by others who pay rent with there being no available rooms
        for Miss Kaur unless one of those  tenants  vacates  the  property.
        This does not appear to have been evidence that was shared with the
        First-tier Tribunal or the Entry  Clearance  Officer.  Although  Mr
        Singh claimed that those in occupation would vacate to  allow  Miss
        Kaur to live at his house this was not supported  by  any  evidence
        from the tenants.


    14. I also find Miss Kaur has not discharged the burden of  proof  upon
        her to show there is  sufficient  evidence  to  avoid  reliance  on
        public funds. Mr Singh has provided documentary evidence  including
        tax returns but the only complete tax return is for  the  tax  year
        ending 2012 which reflects his April 2011 income and which shows  a
        gross income of no more than �7400.  Insufficient evidence has been
        adduced to substantiate the claim there was an income in excess  of
        �12,000 per annum available which is the sum required to  meet  the
        minimum income support payment at the date of  decision.  There  is
        also the issue that part of Mr Singh's income is  made  up  of  the
        rental income and if the tenants have to vacate to allow Miss  Kaur
        to occupy his property with him, that income will be lost  reducing
        the available income further. I found  Mr  Singh  somewhat  evasive
        when discussing this element of the case. The  documents  show  the
        tax he has paid and bank statements show some receipts but not  his
        complete financial situation. The HSBC statement  he  produced  for
        2014 is post decision evidence.


    15. Although Mr Singh submitted that he has sole responsibility for his
        daughter this has not  been  established  on  the  evidence.  Judge
        Sommerville was correct  to  find  that  responsibility  is  shared
        between Mr Singh and Miss  Kaur's  mother  and  that  the  test  is
        therefore whether  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  such  as
        warrant a grant of leave.  Such exceptionality has not been  proved
        on the facts.  I accept that Mr Singh and his daughter  maintain  a
        close relationship and that he gives her advice when  required  but
        it is clear that her mother is in fact her primary carer and it has
        not been established that Miss Kaur's position in India gives  rise
        to any cause for concern in relation to her well-being at this time
        or that in refusing the application such consequences would arise.


    16. I therefore find Miss Kaur has failed to discharge  the  burden  of
        proof upon her to the required standard to show that at the date of
        decision she was able to meet  the  relevant  requirements  of  the
        Immigration Rules.  On this basis the appeal must fail.


Decision

    17. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
        follows. This appeal is dismissed.


   Anonymity.


    18. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005. I make no such
          order pursuant  to  rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
   Tribunal) Rules         2008.


   Fee Award.


   Note: this is not part of the determination.


    19. In the light of my decision to re-make the decision in  the  appeal
        by dismissing it, I have considered whether to  make  a  fee  award
        (rule  23A  (costs)  of  the  Asylum   and   Immigration   Tribunal
        (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  section  12(4)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,
        Courts and Enforcement Act 2007). I have had regard  to  the  Joint
        Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in  Immigration  Appeals
        (December 2011).


          I make no fee award as the appeal is without merit  and  has  been
   dismissed.
