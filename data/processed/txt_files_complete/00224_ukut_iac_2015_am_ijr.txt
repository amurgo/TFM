        i) The common law principles of procedural fairness  apply  to  the
           decision making processes of Entry Clearance Officers ("ECOs").

       ii) ECO interviews serve  the  basic  twofold  purpose  of  enabling
           applications to be probed and investigated and,  simultaneously,
           giving  the  applicant  a  fair  opportunity   to   respond   to
           potentially adverse matters. The  ensuing  decison  must  accord
           with the principles of procedural fairness.

      iii) A breach of the "Case Worker Guidance" may render  the  decision
           of an ECO unlawful.  As a general rule, a challenge advanced  on
           this basis will succeed only where Wednesbury irrationality or a
           material procedural irregularity is established.








                                  Judgment

                         Delivered on 21 March 2015

            Introduction

           [1]   The Applicant, a  national  of  Pakistan  aged  26  years,
                 challenges a decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  of
                 Islamabad (hereinafter the "ECO"),  dated  11  April  2014,
                 whereby the Applicant's application for a  visa  permitting
                 him to enter the United Kingdom for the  purpose  of  study
                 was refused.  By order of His Honour Judge Stephen  Davies,
                 sitting  as  a  Judge  of  the  Upper  Tribunal,  dated  22
                 September 2014, the Applicant's application for  permission
                 to apply for judicial review was  refused.   The  Applicant
                 renewed his application  and,  following  an  inter  partes
                 hearing,  by  order  dated  09  January  2015   I   granted
                 permission on two  grounds,  namely  whether  the  impugned
                 decision was compliant  with  the  operative  guidance  and
                 whether it was harmonious with the principles of procedural
                 fairness.  As appears from what follows,  I  consider  that
                 the public law  misdemeanour  of  Wednesbury  irrationality
                 also features.


           The Impugned Decision


           [2]   The Applicant applied for entry clearance  to  the  United
                 Kingdom under the Tier 4 (General) Student  regime  of  the
                 Points Based System. He had successfully applied  to  study
                 an accountancy course at  an  approved  London  educational
                 establishment.  The  ECO,  in  refusing  his   application,
                 purported to  apply  paragraph  245ZV  of  the  Immigration
                 Rules.  This is one of the self-contained regimes  arranged
                 in Part 6A. The final provision of the  moderately  lengthy
                 paragraph 245ZV is subparagraph (k) which provides:


                      "The Entry Clearance Officer must be  satisfied  that
                      the applicant is a genuine student."


                 Those who seek entry clearance under this route must secure
                 a minimum of 30 points under Appendix A and 10 points under
                 Appendix C, which  relate  to  attributes  and  maintenance
                 respectively.


           [3]   The Applicant was awarded the requisite number of  points,
                 40, by the ECO and, further, none of  the  general  grounds
                 for refusal was applied aversely to him.  However, the  ECO
                 decided that the Applicant was not a  genuine  student  and
                 refused the application accordingly.  This  assessment  was
                 based on the answers which the Applicant  made  to  certain
                 questions during interview by the ECO


           [4]     It is necessary to reproduce the relevant questions  and
                 answers. I shall divide these into appropriate groups.








                                  "Why do you want  to  go  to  the  UK  to
                 study?


                       There is a better  education  there.   This  attracts
                       most of the students.  Because teachers  there  teach
                       you well and when you have a degree from  there,  you
                       get a good job in Pakistan.


                       What will you do when you return to Pakistan?


                       I have a cousin, he has done ACCA.  He intends to
                       establish an ACCT [viz accountancy] firm.  And my
                       mother and my brother wish me to start this firm with
                       him.


                       How will this qualification help establish [the]
           firm?

                       ACCA holders are ext [viz external]  accountants  and
                       CIMA holders are internal  accounts.  When  they  get
                       together they complete firm."

                 For completeness, during this phase of the interview,  the
                 Applicant was asked one further question:


                       "Why CIMA and not ACCA?

                       He has done ACCA and he said I should do CIMA - it is
                       a   good   course.   It   accounts   for/related   to
                       production."

                 In his decision, the ECO adverted to this discrete group of
                 questions and answers, with the following commentary:


                       "It is evident from these answers that  you  have  no
                       idea how your qualification in  isolation  will  help
                       you to achieve your aim.   In addition I do not  find
                       it credible that a prospective student would have  no
                       specific personal reason why they want to  travel  to
                       and  study  in  the  UK  given  the  commitment   and
                       financial costs associated with studying in the UK."

           [5]   During the next section of the  interview,  the  Applicant
                 was questioned about his choice of college and course.

                       "How many  colleges/universities  did  you  research?
                       Which ....

                       I  looked  at  three.   London  School  of   Advanced
                       Studies, European International College, LSBF.


                       Why did you choose this one [ie LSBF]?


                       Their teachers are well qualified and awarded.   LSBF
                       is renowned in field of accounts.


                       Tell me about the facilities available?


                       They will teach us  15  hours  per  week.   And  they
                       showed me that if unfortunately I fail  in  a  paper,
                       they will let me take it again without any additional
                       fee.  I haven't spoken to  them  about  that  yet  in
                       detail.


                       Please  explain  [difference]  between  external  and
                       internal?


                       Internal accounts are for managers,  accountants  and
                       you have to show these ACCTS [sic] to  your  CEO  and
                       these are not meant for client.  It includes the cost
                       of labour, how much time is being spent and how  much
                       profit will be per day. [External] accounts  are  the
                       ones that you can show to others like, what you  show
                       to Government in form  of  taxes  and  matters  about
                       bank, these are all external."

           [6]   In his commentary, the ECO did not reproduce the  last  of
                 these  questions   and   answers.    Rather,   he   focused
                 exclusively on the "facilities" question, stating:


                       "These  responses  do  not  evidence   any   in-depth
                       knowledge of your intended educational institute  and
                       this  undermines  your  credibility  as   a   genuine
                       student."

                 While it would appear from the interview transcript that at
                 some point during the Applicant's response to this question
                 the interviewer interposed the  observation  "Those  aren't
                 facilities",  thereby  prompting   the   ECO   to   comment
                 subsequently that the Applicant was  "pressed"  about  this
                 matter (a somewhat dubious claim), the point at  which  the
                 interviewer made this statement is  far  from  clear.   The
                 transcript is quite unsatisfactory in this respect.

           [7]    The   interviewer   posed   three   further   substantive
                 interrelated questions.

                       "What research have you done into living in London?

                       People  are  multicultural.   You  get  international
                       exposure there which will be good for my  future  and
                       career.


                       [Accommodation?]


                       ACCOMM [sic] will be with my mother's close friend in
                       Seven Kings.


                       [Stay with her all the time?]


                       I will stay with her on rental basis."

                 This was followed by two further substantive questions.

                       "What subjects did you study at Inter?

                       It was in Arts  subjects  and  that  was  Faculty  of
Arts.





                       Why change from Arts to Accounts?


                       Accountancy has more scope in Pakistan at the moment.
                        I should chose [accountancy] field if  I  intend  to
                       brighten my future."

                 In the next section of his commentary, the ECO  highlighted
                 only the first of the  three  questions  in  this  discrete
                 group, stating:


                       "The fact that  you  have  demonstrated  no  concrete
                       knowledge of London given that you intend  to  reside
                       there  throughout  your   studies   undermines   your
                       credibility as a genuine student."

            [8]  The  next  passage  in  the  decision  in  couched  in  the
following terms:

                       "Whilst this is not a prerequisite, I would expect  a
                       genuine student to have an indication of the proposed
                       financial costs they  will  incur  for  a  long  term
                       programme of study, particularly as they are  reliant
                       on financial sponsorship from other  family  members.
                       You state that your mother  will  fund  all  of  your
                       study and that she receives a monthly income  of  PKR
                       100,000.  You have had to evidence a total of  �9,000
                       for maintenance  and  have  already  paid  �2,180  in
                       course fees, totalling �11,180 (PKR 1,812,590)  which
                       represents 18  times  your  mother's  total  declared
                       monthly income.  Given the above, I am not  satisfied
                       that this level of expenditure or financial outlay is
                       commensurate  with   your   family's   personal   and
                       financial circumstances in Pakistan."


                 This was followed by the omnibus conclusionary statement:

                       "In view of all the above, I am not satisfied  as  to
                       your intentions in wishing to travel to the  UK  now.
                       I am therefore not satisfied that you are  a  genuine
                       student."


                       Consideration and Analysis

           [9]   It has been  held  in  previous  decisions  of  the  Upper
                 Tribunal that  the  common  law  principles  of  procedural
                 fairness apply to the decision making process of ECOs.  See
                 T (Entry Clearance)  Jamaica [2011]  UKUT  483  (IAC)  and,
                 more   emphatically,    Miah    (Interviewer's    Comments:
                 Disclosure: Fairness) [2014] UKUT 515 (IAC).  In the latter
                 decision, I made reference to the locus  classicus,  namely
                 the speech of Lord Mustill in R v Secretary  of  State  for
                 the Home Department, ex parte Doody [1994] 1 AC 531.  As  I
                 observed, there is a particular emphasis on context in Lord
                 Mustill's seminal formulation.  Bearing in mind the  nature
                 of the present challenge, I consider  that  the  fifth  and
                 sixth of the  six  general  principles  enunciated  are  of
                 particular significance.  The fifth  principle  articulates
                 the general requirement that the person who is the  subject
                 of the forthcoming decision will  have  an  opportunity  to
                 make representations in advance with a view to producing  a
                 favourable result.  The sixth principle gives expression to
                 the  general  requirement  that  the  person  concerned  is
                 informed of "the gist of the case which he has to  answer".
                 In the present case, the application  of  these  principles
                 was not contested by Mr Najib on behalf of the Secretary of
                 State, correctly in my view.


           [10]   As  appears  above,  the  ECO,  in  making  the  impugned
                 decision, identified a  total  of  five  factors  which  he
                 considered adverse to the genuineness  of  the  Applicant's
                 entry  clearance  application.  I  shall   consider   these
                 seriatim. The first was that the  Applicant's  answers  did
                 not disclose any  "real  idea  how  your  qualification  in
                 isolation will help you to achieve your aim".   This  is  a
                 blunt,  unreasoned  and  unparticularised  statement.   The
                 Applicant  was  in  possession  of   a   "Confirmation   of
                 Acceptance  of  Studies"  certificate  authorising  him  to
                 pursue a CIMA course at the London School of  Business  and
                 Finance.  In response to an  earlier  question,  he  stated
                 that he has a brother in the United Kingdom  who  has  been
                 running a shop for four years. His last  studies  had  been
                 completed  the  previous  year,  following  which  he   had
                 concentrated on his Tier 4  application.   Furthermore,  he
                 outlined what his post-study aspirations were. Given all of
                 these considerations, I consider the ECO's bare, unreasoned
                 statement to be unsustainable, irrational in the Wednesbury
                 sense.  This plainly undermines the decision as a whole.


           [11]  The second factor considered adverse to the genuine nature
                 of the Applicant's application was his asserted failure  to
                 articulate a "specific  personal  reason"  for  his  plans.
                 This phrase  is  undefined  and  unexplained  in  both  the
                 impugned decision and the related guidance (infra).  Having
                 regard to the answers provided  by  the  Applicant,  during
                 both this phase of the interview and generally,  I  readily
                 conclude that this assessment also  is  irrational  in  the
                 Wednesbury sense.  It flies in the teeth of the information
                 provided by the Applicant in response  to  questions.   The
                 alternative public law analysis is that it is in breach  of
                 the principles of procedural fairness since  the  Applicant
                 was  not  informed  that  it  was  incumbent  on   him   to
                 demonstrate a "specific  personal  reason"  for  his  study
                 plans and was not given a reasonable opportunity to do so.




           [12]  The third factor considered  adverse  to  the  Applicant's
                 genuineness was his response to the "facilities"  question.
                 In his answer he focused on the  teaching  which  would  be
                 provided and the second chance opportunity provided in  the
                 event of failing an examination.  The context within  which
                 this discrete question and answer  unfolded  concerned  the
                 educational establishment where he had  been  accepted  for
                 study.   "Facilities"  is  a  very  general  word.   It  is
                 unsurprising that, in his reply, the Applicant concentrated
                 on the educational facilities of the establishment.  If the
                 interviewer  was  desirous  of  testing   the   Applicant's
                 knowledge of other "facilities" available at the college, I
                 consider that fairness required that he make clear that  he
                 was  not  enquiring  about  its  educational  and  teaching
                 services and attributes.  The upshot is that the  Applicant
                 was not, in my estimation, given a fair opportunity to deal
                 with this discrete issue.


           [13]  The fourth factor considered adverse  to  the  Applicant's
                 genuineness was the interviewer's assessment  that  he  had
                 "demonstrated  no  concrete  knowledge  of  London".   This
                 invites the immediate riposte that the questions posed  did
                 not seek to  test  the  Applicant's  general  knowledge  of
                 London.   The  exclusive  focus  of  the  three  sequential
                 questions concerned was  the  Applicant's  residential  and
                 accommodation plans in  London.  He  was  not  asked  about
                 anything else. Nor was  he  probed  about,  or  invited  to
                 develop, the first of his  three  answers.  The  conclusion
                 that he was not afforded a  fair  opportunity  to  disclose
                 whether he possessed any  general  knowledge  about  London
                 follows inexorably.  This too was procedurally unfair.


           [14]  The fifth, and final, factor reckoned to be adverse to the
                 genuine nature  of  the  Applicant's  application  was  the
                 proposed financing of  his  studies  in  London.   The  ECO
                 expressed an expectation that a genuine student would  have
                 "an indication of the proposed financial  costs  they  will
                 incur for a long term programme of study".   The  Applicant
                 was not asked any question to this effect.   In  the  first
                 phase of the interview, he confirmed that  his  mother  was
                 financing him, that her income was  some  PKR  100,000  per
                 month and that this was earned from the rental of a  family
                 owned property.  He was not asked any question  about  "the
                 proposed financial costs [he would] incur for a  long  term
                 programme of study".  Furthermore, none  of  the  questions
                 posed, indirectly, raised this issue.  In addition,  it  is
                 uncontested that the Applicant  satisfied  the  maintenance
                 requirements  fully.   Since  he  was  not   afforded   the
                 opportunity to address this discrete issue, I consider that
                 the adverse  assessment  which  followed  was  procedurally
                 unfair.  Precisely  the  same  assessment  applies  to  the
                 second element of this fifth  adverse  factor,  namely  the
                 ECO's assessment that the proven payments of  some  �11,000
                 for maintenance and course fees were not commensurate  with
                 the family's evident financial status.  This issue was  not
                 raised  at  all,  directly  or   indirectly,   during   the
                 Applicant's interview and a further element  of  procedural
                 unfairness occurred in consequence.


           [15]  It follows from  the  analysis  above  that  the  decision
                 making  process  culminating  in   the   refusal   of   the
                 Applicant's application was manifestly unfair.  I  consider
                 that there were serial breaches of the hallowed maxim  audi
                 alteram partem.  Furthermore, the decision  is  tainted  by
                 irrationality in the respects which I have  diagnosed.  The
                 impugned  decision  of  the  ECO  cannot  be  sustained  in
                 consequence.


           The Guidance Ground of Challenge

           [16]  The further  ground  on  which  permission  to  apply  for
                 judicial review was granted is that the  impugned  decision
                 of the ECO was arguably vitiated on the further basis  that
                 it was not  compatible  with  the  "Case  Worker  Guidance"
                 (hereinafter the "guidance") relating to "Tier 4 interviews
                 and genuine student rule", published on 04  December  2013.
                 Paragraph 2 of the guidance states:


                       "An application should not be refused under paragraph
                       245ZV(k) unless the applicant has had the  chance  to
                       respond to questions at interview (a  credibility  or
                       genuineness interview) unless one  of  the  following
                       circumstances apply ...."

                 The "following circumstances" are of no application to this
                 case.  Given my analysis and  conclusions  in  [9]  -  [15]
                 above, it follows inexorably that  this  provision  of  the
                 guidance was breached, based on  the  fundamental  mismatch
                 between the questions put to the Applicant during interview
                 and the adverse factors condemnation which followed.


           [17]   The  guidance  also  enjoins  ECOs   to   consider   each
                 application "in the round", to take into account the  issue
                 of the "CAS" and to have regard  to  matters  such  as  the
                 person's post-study plans,  their  financial  circumstances
                 and whether the applicant has a credible income  source  to
                 finance the entirety of the course  fees  and  maintenance.
                 The ECO is also specifically required to take into  account
                 that  the   applicant   has   satisfied   the   maintenance
                 requirements and "will be  prepared  to  make  considerable
                 investment  in  gaining  a  qualification  from  the   UK".
                 Finally,  the  guidance   stipulates   that   any   adverse
                 genuineness assessment must be  based  on  the  balance  of
                 probabilities.


           [18]  On balance, I conclude that the ECO did not fail to comply
                 with any of the further aspects of the guidance outlined in
                 [17] above. I prefer the submissions of Mr  Najib  on  this
                 issue.  I consider that, as a  general  rule,  a  challenge
                 advanced on this basis will succeed only  if  the  exacting
                 threshold of demonstrating irrationality in the  Wednesbury
                 sense is overcome or a material procedural irregularity  is
                 demonstrated.


                 General


           [19]   I  make  one  concluding  observation.   The  choice   of
                 questions and words in ECO  interviews  requires  care  and
                 planning.  Ambiguous words and phrases are to  be  avoided.
                 Furthermore,  fairness  will   often   require   that   the
                 interviewer invite the subject  to  clarify  or  expand  an
                 answer or probe a response.  These simple  mechanisms  will
                 also illuminate  the  court's  assessment  of  whether  any
                 ensuing adverse decision was preordained.  The nationals of
                 impoverished and deprived countries who have invested large
                 sums of money and whose admission to the United Kingdom  is
                 lawful if they satisfy the  requirements  of  the  relevant
                 legal rules are deserving of no less.






           Conclusion and Order


           [20]  I make an order quashing the impugned decision of the ECO.
                  Further, subject to any representations to the contrary on
                 the part of the Respondent:


                 a) the Applicant is entitled to his costs in full; and


                 b)  permission to appeal to the  Court  of  Appeal  is  not
                    appropriate, as




                 I  consider  this  a  fact  specific  case  entailing   the
                 application  of  well   established   principles   to   its
                 particular matrix.
