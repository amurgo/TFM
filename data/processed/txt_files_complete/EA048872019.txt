For the Respondent:    Mr A Sesay of Freemans Solicitors (written
representations)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The claimant is a citizen of Nigeria who was born on 9 October 1971.  On 29
October 2018, she applied for a residence card as an 'extended family
member' of her EEA partner (claiming to be in a durable relationship) under
reg 18(4) (read with reg 8(5)) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016
(SI 2016/1052).

On 2 September 2019, the Secretary of State refused the claimant's
application.  The Secretary of State was not satisfied that the claimant
was in a durable relationship with her EEA national, partner.

The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a decision sent on
12 March 2020, Judge S Meah accepted that the relationship between her and
her partner was a "durable relationship" and allowed the claimant's appeal
under the EEA Regulations 2016.

The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.
On 30 May 2020, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Foudy) refused the Secretary
of State permission to appeal.  On a renewed application, UTJ Allen granted
permission on 23 July 2020.

The claimant filed a rule 24 response on 8 December 2020.

The appeal was listed for hearing before me on 29 April 2021.  However, in
advance of the hearing, the parties agreed a "Consent Order" in the
following terms:

         "UPON the Appellant (SSHD) accepting  the  finding  of  First  Tier
         Tribunal Judge Meah in the determination of 12 March 2020 that  the
         Respondent (Ms Ibeawuchi) is in a  durable  relationship  with  the
         sponsor, Mr Franci Sangalli Korletey, pursuant to Regulation  8  of
         the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016


         AND UPON it being noted that the Appellant (SSHD)  did  not  appeal
         the determination in respect of the finding that Ms Ibeawuchi is in
         a durable relationship


         BY CONSENT IT IS ASKED THAT THE TRIBUNAL:


         1.   Finds no error in law and dismisses the Secretary  of  State's
             appeal.


         2.   The hearing  currently  listed  on  29  April  2021,  for  the
             Secretary of State's appeal, shall be vacated.


         3.   The Secretary of State shall use best endeavours, by 4  pm  on
             07 June 2021, to Ibeawuchi is entitled  to  a  residence  card
             under Regulation 18 of the 2016 Regulations in  light  of  the
             determination of 12 March 2020.


         4.    Subject  to  the  outcome  of  the   Secretary   of   State's
             consideration in paragraph 2 above,  the  Secretary  of  State
             shall   thereafter   promptly,   determine   Ms    Ibeawuchi's
             application, made on 14 December 2020, under the EU Settlement
             Scheme."


In an e-mail dated 27 April 2021, Mr Deller, on behalf of the Secretary of
State, explicitly agreed the order which including an invitation to the UT
to dismiss the Secretary of State's appeal to the UT on the basis that
there was no error of law in the FtT's decision.

In the light of this, I consider it just and fair to determine the error of
law issue without a hearing under rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008. I directed that the hearing on 29 April 2021 be
vacated.

In line with the agreed position of the parties set out in para 1 of the
"Order", I have concluded that the FtT did not err in law in allowing the
claimant's appeal under the EEA Regulations 2016.  That decision,
therefore, stands.



Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow the claimant's appeal did
not involve making of an error of law.  The First-tier's decision stands.

The Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper Tribunal is, accordingly,
dismissed.


Signed                              Date 29 April 2021

Andrew Grubb

Judge of the Upper Tribunal
