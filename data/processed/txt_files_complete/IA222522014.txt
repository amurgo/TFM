                                  GA BLACK


                                   Between

           THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT     Appellant

                                     and

      MR KEYUR PURUSHOTTAM PATEL  Claimant


Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr N Bramble (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the claimant:      Mrs S Ali (Counsel instructed by Shehzad Chambers)


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL

      1. This case was listed before me for consideration of whether or  not
         there is an  error  of  law  in  the  determination  of  First-tier
         Tribunal (FtT) Judge Miles promulgated  on  9th  February  2015  in
         which the Judge allowed the appeal to the extent that the  decision
         made was not in accordance with the law and remitted the matter  to
         the  Secretary  of  State  for  reconsideration  under  section  55
         Borders, Citizenship & Immigration Act 2009.

      2. Mr Bramble conceded that in light  of  the  recent  Upper  Tribunal
         decision in MK (section 55 - Tribunal options) Sierra Leone  [2015]
         UKUT 00223 (IAC) the decision made by the FtT showed  no  error  of
         law. In effect MK had to an extent  resolved the apparent  conflict
         between the Court of Appeal judgment  in AJ (India) v  SSHD  [2011]
         EWCA CIV 1191 and the  Upper  Tribunal  decision  in  JO  &  others
         (section 55 duty)  Nigeria  [2014]  UKUT  00517  (IAC)  by  clearly
         stating the policy of the Secretary of State at [23].   Mr  Bramble
         acknowledged that in this instance the Secretary of  State  totally
         failed to consider where the best interests  of  the  two  children
         lie.

      3. Mrs Ali, who prepared a response under Rule 24, confirmed that  she
         had no objections to the withdrawal of the appeal.

      4. I give permission for the appeal to be withdrawn in accordance with
         Rule 17 Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules 2008.

      5. Accordingly the decision and reasons of the FtT shall stand.

      6. The proceedings in the Upper Tribunal are now disposed of and  have
         come to an end.

GA Black (Deputy Judge of the Upper Tribunal)
