Representation:

For the Appellant:       Ms A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Bassiri- Bezfoali (counsel) instructed by A2
solicitors



                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2. The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal but  in
order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as  they  were  in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer, promulgated on13  April  2015,
which allowed the Appellant's appeal against the  respondent's  decision  to
make a deportation order under the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

Background


3. The Appellant was born on 13 July 1994 and is a national of Poland.

4. On 13 November 2014 the respondent decided to make  a  deportation  order
relying on regulation 19(30(b) of the 2006 regulations.


The Judge's Decision

5. The Appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Colyer ("the Judge")  allowed  the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision.

6. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 02 July 2015  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
King gave permission to appeal stating

      "The issue arises as to imperative grounds of public security and  the
      Judge for sound reasons found there to be none.


      "However the offending history of the appellant dates from 2006 and is
      a bad one. A pattern of  antisocial  behaviour  raises  the  issue  of
      integration  within  the  community.  In   those   circumstances   the
      respondent seeks to rely upon MG(EUECJ C-400/12) a decision in 2014.


      "It does not  seem  to  have  been  raised  at  the  hearing  and  its
      relationship  with  the  EEA  regulations  will  also   need   to   be
      considered."


The Hearing

7. Ms Holmes, for the respondent, moved the  grounds  of  appeal.  She  told
that she did not intend to place any great emphasis  on  the  first  ground,
drawing my attention to [21] & [27] to [32] of the decision. She  relies  on
the second ground of appeal and argued that the Judge was  wrong  to  accept
that the appellant has been resident in the UK for 10 years  and  more,  and
so could only  be  deported  on  Imperative  grounds  of  public  policy  or
security. She told me that inadequate consideration had been  given  to  the
appellant's history of offending behaviour, which (it is  argued)  mitigates
against his integration into the UK for the relevant 10 year period. It  was
argued that the Judge had incorrectly applied the ratio in the  case  of  MG
(EUECJ C-400/12. Ms Holmes argued that the Judge had taken far  too  lenient
a view of risk and had made only selected  use  of  the  evidence  of  risk,
leading the Judge to conclusions inconsistent with the OASyS  report  placed
before him. She argued that the Judge had misdirected himself in  regard  to
risk  and  incorrectly  found  that  the  appellant  was  at  low  risk   of
reoffending,  when  the  OASyS  report  says  he  is  at  medium   risk   of
reoffending. Ms Holmes told me  that  the  errors  made  by  the  Judge  are
material errors of law which also taint his article 8 ECHR  assessment.  She
urged me to allow the appeal and set the Judge's decision aside.

8. For the appellant, Ms Bassiri-Bezfoali told me  that  the  decision  does
not contain any material  errors  of  law,  but  is  a  carefully  worded  &
carefully considered decision which reaches a conclusion  justified  by  the
evidence  presented  to  the  Judge.  She  reminded  me  that  none  of  the
appellant's  witnesses  were  cross  examined  and  that  the  Home   Office
presenting officer at first  instance  declined  to  make  a  submission  to
contradict the evidence that the appellant had been in the UK for more  than
10 years. At [9] the Judge makes a specific finding that the appellant's  10
years  residence  in  the  UK  was  completed  before  his  first  custodial
sentence. She argued that the case law  supported  the  appellant's  appeal,
and that the ratio of MG (relied on by the  respondent)  has  been  properly
applied by the Judge. She urged me to  dismiss  the  appeal  and  allow  the
Judge's decision to stand

Analysis

9. In Land Baden-Wï¿½rttemberg  v  Tsakouridis  (Case  C-145/09)  CJEU  (Grand
Chamber), the Claimant was a Greek national.  He had lived  in  Germany  for
almost 30 years and since 2001 had had  an  unlimited  residence  permit  in
that country. He had regularly worked  in  Greece  during  the  period.  The
Grand Chamber  held  that  the  decisive  criterion  for  granting  enhanced
protection under Article 28(3)(a) was whether the Union citizen had  resided
in the host Member State for the 10 years preceding the expulsion  decision.
The national authorities responsible  for  determining  that  question  were
required  to  take  into  account  all  relevant  considerations   in   each
particular case, in particular the duration of each period of  absence  from
the host Member State,  the  cumulative  duration  and  frequency  of  those
absences and the reasons why the person left the host Member State.

10.  In Secretary of State for the Home Department v FV (Italy) [2012]  EWCA
Civ 1199 it was held that the continuity of residence  for  the  purpose  of
regulation  21(4)(a)  was  not  broken  by   a   period   of   imprisonment:
Jarusevicius (EEA Reg 21 - effect of imprisonment)  [2012]  UKUT  120  (IAC)
approved.  The question whether the requirement of a  continuous  period  of
ten years' residence was established at the date of the decision  to  deport
turned on the degree of integration established at that time.   That  was  a
question of fact for the Tribunal.  Periods of absence during the ten  years
immediately preceding the decision did not, of  themselves,  disqualify  and
neither did a period of  imprisonment.   The  period  of  imprisonment  was,
however,  relevant  as  a  factor  to  be  considered  when  deciding   upon
integration at the date of decision.   Integration  would  not  normally  be
established by the time spent in prison save  that  it  might  have  limited
relevance by contributing to the severance of  links  with  the  country  of
origin.  If integration had been established prior to  the  custodial  term,
it would not necessarily be lost by that term.  The decision would  turn  on
an overall qualitative assessment having regard  to  all  relevant  factors,
including the length of residence, family connections and any  interruptions
in integration. (Per Aikens and Rafferty LJJ)  The  key  questions  for  the
Tribunal to ask when considering whether there had  been  a  period  of  ten
years' residence prior to the decision to deport were  whether  imprisonment
involved either  the  transfer  to  another  State  of  the  centre  of  the
personal, family or occupational interests of the person  concerned,  and/or
whether the "integrating links"  previously  forged  with  the  host  Member
State had been broken: Tsakouridis followed.

11. In SSHD v MG Case no c-400/12 CJEU  second  chamber  it  was  held  that
unlike the requisite period for acquiring a  right  of  permanent  residence
which began when the person concerned  commenced  lawful  residence  in  the
post Member State, the 10 year period of residence necessary for  the  grant
of the  enhanced  protection  provided  for  in  Article  28(3)(a)  must  be
calculated by counting back from the date  of  the  decision  ordering  that
person's expulsion. All relevant factors should be taken into  account  when
considering the calculation of the 10 year period including the duration  of
each period of absence from the host Member State, the  cumulative  duration
and the frequency of absences. A period of  imprisonment  was  in  principle
capable both of interrupting the  continuity  of  the  period  of  residence
needed and of  affecting  the  decision  regarding  the  grant  of  enhanced
protection provided  there  under,  even  where  the  person  concerned  had
resided in the host member state for 10 years prior to  imprisonment  albeit
that the fact that the person had been in the member state  10  years  prior
to imprisonment was a factor to be taken into account.

12. In Essa (EEA: rehabilitation/integration) [2013]  UKUT  00316  (IAC)  it
was held that the Court of Justice's reference in Case C-145/09 Land  Baden-
Wurtemberg v Tsakouridis [2011] CMLR 11 to genuine integration, should  mean
people who have resided lawfully in the Host state for  five  years  and  so
have the right to permanent residence, rather than people who  have  resided
for ten years.

13. The focus in this appeal is on the calculation of 10 years residence  in
the UK and the impact that period of residence has. The case of MG  was  not
argued at  first  instance,  however  at  [34]  the  Judge  finds  that  the
appellant arrived in the UK in 2001, when he was seven years of age. At  [8]
the Judge makes it clear that he indicated to parties' agents that he  would
accept the evidence that the appellant had been in the UK for more  than  10
years. Between [27] and [32] the Judge discusses  the  length  of  time  the
appellant has been UK. At [32] the Judge comes to the  conclusion  that  the
appellant "... had been living (in the UK) for well over 10 years before  he
was arrested on 27 May 2013".

14. Between [10]  and  [18]  the  Judge  correctly  sets  out  the  law.  No
challenge is taken to what is said by the Judge between [10]  and  [18].  He
has manifestly directed himself correctly in law.

15. No specific challenge is taken to the facts as the Judge found  them  to
be, nor to his self-direction in law. The challenge of the respondent is  in
reality a fresh argument based on a restricted reading of the rubric  (only)
of the case of MG. The case-law set out above indicates that the  length  of
residence in the UK is one of many factors to be  taken  into  account  when
assessing the degree of integration. The case-law also makes it  clear  that
the question of integration is a question of fact for the tribunal at  first
instance.

16. A fair reading of the Judge's decision makes it  quite  clear  that  the
period of residence in the UK was one of a number of factors weighed by  the
judge in assessing integration. Having determined  that  the  appellant  had
resided in the UK for more than 10 years prior to his arrest  in  2013,  the
judge weighed that  factor  as  part  of  the  careful  structure  of  other
relevant factors set out in detail in his decision.

17. One of the central factors  to  be  placed  alongside  the  question  of
length of residence is an assessment of risk. The respondent challenges  the
Judge's assessment of risk, arguing that  is  inconsistent  with  the  OASyS
report produced. The flaw in  the  respondent's  argument  (raised  for  the
first time at appeal) is that the  OASyS  report  was  only  one  strand  of
evidence to be taken  into  account  in  assessing  the  question  of  risk.
Between [43] & [47] the Judge discusses the content  of  the  OASyS  report.
Between [48] and [55] the Judge considers the prospects of rehabilitation.

18. At [64], after weighing all  of  those  components,  the  Judge  reaches
reasoned conclusions in terms of the 2006 regulations. It is there that  the
Judge sets out the conclusion that the appellant has  acquired  a  permanent
right of residence in UK in terms of the 2006 regulations. It is there  that
the Judge finds that the appellant does not  represent  the  level  of  risk
which presents a challenge to the fundamental interests of UK society.

19. Those are conclusions which were open to the Judge to  reach.  They  are
conclusions which take guidance from, and are consistent with, the  case-law
set out above. The respondent does not like the conclusion  that  the  Judge
reached, but the conclusion is correct in law on  the  facts  as  the  Judge
found them to be.

20. It is not an arguable error of law  for  a  Judge  to  give  too  little
weight or too much weight to a  factor,  unless  irrationality  is  alleged.
Disagreement with a  Judge's  factual  conclusions,  his  appraisal  of  the
evidence or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of  risk  does  not
give  rise  to  an  error  of  law.   Unless   a   Judge's   assessment   of
proportionality is arguable as being completely wrong, there is no error  of
law.

21. In closing, Ms Holmes argued that the Judge's article 8  assessment  was
inadequate. That argument was entirely dependent on my findings in  relation
to the duration of residence, the assessment of risk  and  the  question  of
integration. I find that there is no material error of law to  be  found  in
any of the arguments made by first four grounds of appeal. Between [65]  and
[85] the Judge considers the appellant's article 8 ECHR rights.  It  is  not
argued that the Judge misdirected himself in law.  I find that  the  Judge's
self-direction in law is correct. The Judge considers the  factors  weighing
both for and against the appellant before reaching the conclusion  that  the
respondent's decision is a disproportionate breach of the right  to  respect
for private life in terms of article 8 ECHR.

22. The Judge's article 8 analysis is detailed. It is  based  on  a  correct
application of the law applying to the facts as the Judge found them to  be.
Once again, the grounds of appeal amount to  little  more  the  Respondent's
expression of dissatisfaction with a decision which went in the  appellant's
favour.

23.  In Shizad (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that (i) Although there is  a  legal  duty  to  give  a  brief
explanation of the conclusions on the central issue on which  an  appeal  is
determined, those reasons need not be extensive if the decision as  a  whole
makes sense, having regard to the  material  accepted  by  the  judge;  (ii)
Although a decision may contain an error of law where  the  requirements  to
give adequate reasons are not met, the Upper  Tribunal  would  not  normally
set aside a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  where  there  has  been  no
misdirection of law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised  and  the
relevant  Country  Guidance  has  been  taken  into  account,   unless   the
conclusions the Judge draws from the primary data were not  reasonably  open
to him or her.

24. A fair reading of the  Judge's  decision  indicates  that  there  is  no
misdirection of law and that the fact-finding process cannot be  criticised.
As I have already indicated, the Judge's conclusions are  conclusions  which
were reasonably open to him to reach.

25.  I find that the Judge's determination when read  as  a  whole  set  out
findings that were  sustainable  and  sufficiently  detailed  and  based  on
cogent reasoning.

CONCLUSION

26. No errors of law have been established. The Judge's decision stands.

DECISION

27. The appeal is dismissed.
