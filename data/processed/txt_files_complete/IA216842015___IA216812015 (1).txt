Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr O. Ngwuocha, counsel instructed by Carl Martin
                    solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr K. Norton, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                                  DECISION

   1. The first appellant is the mother of the  second  appellant,  who  was
      born in the United Kingdom on [ ] 2004, so that she is  now  13  years
      and 3 months old. Both are citizens of Brazil. The second  appellant's
      father is an Iraqi national who is unlawfully present in the UK, as he
      has been for 17 years, his asylum claim having been rejected.  He  and
      the first appellant  are  no  longer  in  a  relationship.  The  first
      appellant has sole parental responsibility for  the  second  appellant
      but her father is said to maintain regular contact.


   2. The first appellant first arrived in the United Kingdom  in  2003  and
      was admitted as a visitor. She overstayed that leave and,  as  I  have
      just said, the second appellant was born on 5 February 2004. The first
      appellant returned to Brazil in September  2004,  accompanied  by  the
      second appellant, but they came back to the United Kingdom, the  first
      appellant having again secured entry clearance as a visitor,  in  July
      2008.  Thus,  the  second  appellant  has  lived  in  her  country  of
      nationality for 3 years and 9 months between the ages of 7 months  and
      4 years 5 months or thereabouts. Both  have  remained  in  the  United
      Kingdom ever since, having no leave since the expiry  of  their  visit
      visas.


   3. In these proceedings, the appellants appeal against a decision of  the
      respondent, made on 26 May 2015,  to  refuse  their  applications  for
      leave to remain on the basis of rights protected by article 8  of  the
      ECHR.


   4. The parties are of course aware of the litigation history that  brings
      the appeal before me and for present  purposes  it  is  sufficient  to
      summarise it briefly.  The appeal  was  dismissed  by  the  First-tier
      Tribunal following a hearing before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Woolley
      on 11 July 2016. Permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  having
      been granted, the appeal  came  before  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
      Hanbury on 14 December  2016.  It  was  accepted  before  him  by  the
      respondent that Judge Woolley had made a material  error  of  law  and
      Judge Hanbury went on to substitute a fresh decision  to  dismiss  the
      appeal. In response to an application for permission to appeal to  the
      Court of Appeal, his decision was then set  aside  by  Upper  Tribunal
      Judge Rimmington under rules 45  and  46  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
      (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, because Judge Hanbury  had  overlooked  a
      statutory provision, that being  s117D  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act"), and so had  wrongly  concluded  that
      the second appellant was not a qualifying child for  the  purposes  of
      s117B.

   5. It was common ground and agreed between  the  parties  that  my  task,
      therefore, was to substitute a fresh decision as to whether  to  allow
      or dismiss the appeal against refusal to grant leave to remain.

   6. Although the decisions of Judge Woolley and Judge  Hanbury  have  been
      set aside, the judgment of Judge Woolley stands as  a  record  of  the
      evidence given before her. Mr Ngwuocha said that the facts  are  to  a
      large extent not in dispute and  so,  although  both  appellants  were
      present, he would not call either of them to  give  oral  evidence.  I
      made clear that I had before me only a brief witness statement of  the
      first appellant prepared for the hearing in July 2016 and  no  written
      evidence from either the second appellant or her father so that all  I
      did have was that recorded as the evidence of the first appellant  and
      [SP] in the judgment of Judge Woolley. She  had  heard  oral  evidence
      from the appellant's  father,  [SP],  although  that  related  to  the
      position as it was in July 2016, nearly a  year  ago,  whereas  I,  of
      course, am  concerned  with  the  circumstances  as  they  are  today.
      However, Mr Ngwuocha said he would  proceed  to  his  submissions  and
      would not call oral evidence from either of the appellants.  The  only
      additional evidence put before the tribunal is a more recent  progress
      report from the school attended by  the  second  appellant  which  was
      introduced without objection from Mr Norton.


   7. The issue to be addressed in this appeal is a narrow one. Both parties
      submitted and agreed that the question that is  determinative  of  the
      outcome of this appeal is that posed by s 117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act,
      whether it would or would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the  second
      appellant, who is a qualifying child because  she  has  lived  in  the
      United Kingdom for a continuous period of more than  seven  years,  to
      leave the United Kingdom. Although I agree that is the main  focus  of
      this appeal, given that s117A(2) is expressed in mandatory terms, I do
      not propose to confine my  assessment  to  that  provision  alone  and
      exclusively. S117 provides, so far as is relevant, as follows:



             '117A Application of this Part

                  (1) This Part applies where a court or tribunal is
                  required to determine whether a decision made under the
                  Immigration Acts-"

                      (a) breaches a person's right to respect for private
                      and family life under Article 8, and

                      (b) as a result would be unlawful under section 6 of
                      the Human Rights Act 1998.

                  (2) In considering the public interest question, the court
                  or tribunal must (in particular) have regard-"

                      (a) in all cases, to the considerations listed in
                      section 117B, and

                      (b) in cases concerning the deportation of foreign
                      criminals, to the considerations listed in section
                      117C.

                  (3) In subsection (2), "the public interest question"
                  means the question of whether an interference with a
                  person's right to respect for private and family life is
                  justified under Article 8(2).

             117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in
             all cases

                  (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is
                  in the public interest.

                  (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
                  interests of the economic well-being of the United
                  Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the
                  United Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons
                  who can speak English-"

                      (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                      (b) are better able to integrate into society.

                  (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
                  interests of the economic well-being of the United
                  Kingdom, that persons who seek to enter or remain in the
                  United Kingdom are financially independent, because such
                  persons-" ?

                      (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and ?

                      (b) are better able to integrate into society.

                  (4) Little weight should be given to-"

                      (a) a private life, or ?

                      (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
                      ? that is established by a person at a time when the
                      person is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

                  (5) Little weight should be given to a private life
                  established by a person at a time when the person's
                  immigration status is precarious.

                  (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to
                  deportation, the public interest does not require the
                  person's removal where-"

                      (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                      relationship with a qualifying child, and

                      (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                      leave the United Kingdom.'




   8. Mr Ngwuocha realistically accepts that the appeal  cannot  succeed  on
      the basis of private life established in the United Kingdom while  the
      appellants have been unlawfully present and that family  life  between
      the appellants themselves will not be disturbed as  a  result  of  the
      decision under appeal. He did not suggest either that  the  appellants
      could succeed under  276ADE(vi)  on  the  basis  of  very  significant
      obstacles to integration on return to Brazil. He said  that  the  only
      basis upon which the appeal can succeed is if  it  is  found  that  it
      would not be reasonable to expect the second appellant  to  leave  the
      United Kingdom, a  proposition  with  which  Mr  Norton  agreed  also.
      Therefore, I need not set out any discussion of the reasons  given  by
      the respondent for refusing  the  application  under  the  partner  or
      parent routes under the Immigration Rules or on the basis  of  private
      life. Although para 276ADE(iv) of Appendix  FM  contains  a  provision
      recognising the significance of a child having resided continuously in
      the United Kingdom for at least 7 years, there is a distinction in the
      rules that disqualifies this child because, unlike the position  under
      s117B(6), the 7 year period must have been accumulated by the date  of
      the application, which in this case it was not.


   9. Having explained, correctly, why the appellants  could  not  meet  the
      requirements of the  immigration  rules  the  respondent  went  on  to
      consider whether the application disclosed anything such as to require
      a grant  of  leave  outside  the  rules.  In  respect  of  the  second
      appellant's father, the respondent said  that  although  it  had  been
      claimed that the relationship between the  second  appellant  and  her
      father would be "affected" if the appellants were to return to Brazil,
      he had no valid leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

  10.  Next,  the  respondent  considered  her  duty  under   s55   Borders,
      Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 which she said "requires that the
      best interests of a child are a consideration which need to  be  taken
      into account whenever UK Visas and Immigration undertakes  enforcement
      action" and, uncontroversial, that the best interests of a child whose
      parents are being removed are served by remaining with the parents and
      being removed with them.

  11. The respondent then set  out  a  summary  of  the  factors  which  she
      considered demonstrated that the decision to refuse to grant leave was
      "reasonable and section 55 compliant":


         . That your child is to be removed with their  parent(s),  clearly
           the most important people in their lives and this will help them
           to adapt to life in Brazil.
         . That your child is a national of Brazil and  will  therefore  be
           able to enjoy all of the  benefits  and  advantages  citizenship
           entails.
         . That your child is to be returned to a country  where  there  is
           provision for education.
         . That your child is not yet old enough to have started  to  study
           towards a recognised qualification.
         . That your child is not yet old  enough  to  have  developed  any
           skills which are not transferable to Brazil.
         . That you have provided no evidence of any special educational or
           medical needs for your child which need to be considered.
         . That your child is to be removed to a country  where  you  lived
           and it is assumed worked until the age of 19 and no  explanation
           has been provided as to  why  you  would  be  unable  to  secure
           similar employment on your return.
         . That you have never possessed leave to  enter  or  remain  which
           leads to settlement in the United Kingdom. Therefore you  cannot
           have had a realistic expectation that you will be able to remain
           in this country permanently and as such it was your decision not
           to educate them with a view to returning to Brazil.
         . That your child has  always  remained  in  the  care  of  Brazil
           nationals and therefore will be aware  to  some  extent  of  the
           language and culture country.


  12.  The first point made is expressed clumsily, making reference, on  one
      interpretation, to both parents. As was confirmed by Mr Norton at  the
      hearing, there was no question of the second appellant's  father  also
      being removed to Brazil because there was no  basis  upon  which  that
      could lawfully be done. It may be that this is a  confused  conflation
      of a general statement of principle, with a recognition that this  was
      not a case where both parents would be removed with the  child,  which
      would explain why the reference is to "parent(s)" and  not  simply  to
      "parents".


  13. In his oral submissions, Mr Ngwuocha identified what he said were  the
      material facts relied upon as demanding an outcome in the  appellants'
      favour. He said the second appellant's relationship  with  her  father
      was a  factor  of  particular  significance.  It  was,  he  submitted,
      established by the evidence before the First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
      second appellant had a "great relationship" with her father  and  that
      "she sees him every day". This was not a case where the  family  would
      all  be  removed  together,  thus  preserving  family  life,  and  the
      respondent's decision was wrongly predicated on the basis  that  would
      be the position, speaking as it did of the child being  "removed  with
      their parent(s), clearly the most important people  in  their  lives".
      Also, the second appellant was doing well at school and her  education
      would be disrupted. He submitted that  the  only  thing  that  counted
      against the appellant was the fact that the first appellant had chosen
      to overstay her visit visa and remain  without  leave  in  the  United
      Kingdom.

  14. Pausing there, I do not accept Mr  Ngwuocha's  interpretation  of  the
      refusal letter. That the decision was not, in  fact,  predicated  upon
      the misconception that the second appellant's father would be  removed
      to Brazil is made clear by what the respondent  said  in  the  refusal
      letter  concerning  the  second  appellant  herself.  Addressing   the
      question of whether it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  the  second
      appellant to leave United Kingdom the respondent said this:


           "However, it is not considered to be unreasonable to expect  you
           to leave the UK because you will be  leaving  with  your  mother
           Rosita De Souza as a family unit. Rosita De Souza will  be  able
           to help you reintegrate into life in Brazil. You will  still  be
           able to keep in contact with family and friends  in  the  UK  to
           (sic) modern communication methods."

  15. As there is no evidence at all before me, written or  oral,  from  the
      second appellant's father, I can only look to what is  recorded  about
      the evidence concerning him  provided  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
      Woolley in July 2016. At para 11 of her decision she recorded that the
      first appellant had said this:


           "... She (the second appellant) had a  great  relationship  with
           her father and sees him every day. He picks her up  from  school
           and takes her to the supermarket..."


      and at para 12:


           "It would be difficult for the father to go to Brazil as he  had
           too many friends here and it  would  be  difficult  for  him  to
           leave. He was in the UK illegally. He claimed asylum  some  time
           ago. She did not know his situation but he had no status in  the
           UK..."


      and at para 13:


           "She did not remember the address of the father as she does  not
           go to his home and did not like her daughter going to his house.
           She was not living with him. She  had  supported  herself  doing
           some gardening jobs and the father helps..."


      and at para 14:


           "... she said the father looks  at  what  his  daughter  did  in
           school and her homework. He gives her �30 a week. There  was  no
           court or contact order  in  existence.  He  lives  with  another
           person and she didn't like going  to  his  house.  He  sees  his
           daughter after school and came to parents' evening".


      And of the oral evidence given by [SP] himself,  at  paras  15-16  the
      judge recorded this:


           "He gave his address in Swindon as c/o a charity as this was the
           address he had to give for  the  IS.96.  He  was  close  to  his
           daughter and saw her every day. He could not relocate to  Brazil
           as he had never been there. He had no  ongoing  application.  He
           came to the UK from Iraq in 1999 and had been refused asylum. He
           still reported to the Home Office. He had been told to leave. It
           would be hard to go back to Kurdistan.


           ...he said he was staying with friends for temporary periods and
           had no permanent address. ... He had not chosen to try to go  to
           Brazil. He discusses any decisions about his daughter  with  her
           mother but would not mind what happened as long as his  daughter
           was happy. She asks him about decisions and he always agrees. He
           worked illegally cash in hand in  car  washes  and  gardens.  He
           gives her around �40 to �50 a month when he makes money.  He  is
           not supposed to work. He  has  no  NAS  support.  If  they  were
           removed  it  would  affect  him  badly.  He  was  in  no   other
           relationship and saw his daughter  Monday  to  Thursday  and  at
           weekends."



  16. In her witness statement prepared for the hearing  in  July  2016  the
      first appellant said:


           "I confirm that I live in a single family unit with my child.  I
           have sole parental responsibility for her...


           I confirm that my child does  enjoy  regular  contact  with  her
           father and this close relationship subsists."




  17. For the respondent, Mr Norton premised his submissions by saying  that
      the outcome of the appeal would turn on the question of whether it was
      reasonable to expect  the  child  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.  He
      accepted that the evidence indicated a number of factors that spoke in
      the appellants' favour: the length of residence of  the  child,  which
      meant that she was a qualifying child for the  purposes  of  s117B(6);
      her level of integration; given her  age,  a  natural  progression  of
      relationships in the United Kingdom; the evidence suggested  that  the
      second appellant was an intelligent child who was doing well at school
      and, of course, her relationship with her father.  Despite  that,  the
      fact remained that she and her mother are citizens of Brazil  with  no
      right of residence in the United Kingdom. Although Mr  Norton  accepts
      that the child has continuing contact with her father,  sole  parental
      responsibility rests with her mother. Her father  has  no  immigration
      status in the United Kingdom and is liable to be removed at any  time.
      It is the respondent's position  that  it  is  clearly  reasonable  to
      expect the child to leave the United Kingdom with her mother, even  if
      this will affect the nature of contact she has with her father.


      Discussion:


  18. Mr Norton is, of course, correct to say also that a  balance  must  be
      struck between the competing interests  in  play.  The  assessment  of
      reasonableness in s117B(6) is informed by all of the circumstances and
      not just what is in the best interests of the child, although that  is
      of course a consideration of primary importance.


  19. In considering the public interest question, I am required by s117A(2)
      of the 2002 Act to have regard, in particular, to  the  considerations
      listed in s117B. Both appellants have remained present in  the  United
      Kingdom without leave, consuming public services, not least  in  terms
      of the education of the second appellant; a factor now relied upon  as
      a reason for allowing her to remain permanently. That is a significant
      factor in terms of the weight of the  public  interest  argument.  The
      immigration history of the first appellant is a particularly poor  one
      because I have no doubt at all that when she returned  to  the  United
      Kingdom as a visitor in July 2008 she had every intention that she and
      her daughter would remain beyond the period allowed for the visit. Put
      another way, I am entirely satisfied that when  she  applied  on  that
      occasion  for  entry  clearance  she  dishonestly  misrepresented  her
      purpose in doing so, thereby deliberately undermining the integrity of
      immigration control.


  20. Both appellants  speak  English  fluently,  unsurprisingly  given  the
      length of time they have lived here  and  the  fact  that  the  second
      appellant has spent not just a period of more than 7 years  living  in
      the United Kingdom but most of her life.  The  evidence  is  that  the
      second appellant has spoken both English and Portuguese at home.


  21. The fact that the second appellant has now lived continuously  in  the
      United Kingdom for more than 7 years is a matter of significance  that
      speaks in her favour. That is particularly so given that  this  period
      represents an important period in her life and is one during which all
      of her education has been experienced.


  22. There is very little evidence before me about how the first  appellant
      has provided for herself and her daughter but there is  no  suggestion
      that she is in receipt of public funds and it has not been part of the
      respondent's case that she is not  financially  independent.  However,
      such evidence as there is indicates that both the first appellant  and
      the second appellant's father have been  working  unlawfully  with  no
      suggestion that those earnings have been declared to HMRC.


  23. It is a requirement of primary legislation that little weight is to be
      given to private life established while person is present  unlawfully,
      but this is not a case that  turns  to  any  significant  degree  upon
      issues of private life.


  24. Which brings us to s117B(6). The evidence  in  July  2016  established
      that, although the first appellant has  sole  parental  responsibility
      for the second appellant, family life existed, actively,  between  the
      second appellant and her father. It is uncontroversial  that,  in  the
      absence of reasons for concluding otherwise, the best  interest  of  a
      child require that she maintain contact  with  both  parents  wherever
      that is possible.  The second appellant's father has no  lawful  basis
      for being in the United Kingdom and, theoretically, is  liable  to  be
      detained and removed to Iraq at any time. However, he has been in  the
      United Kingdom for 17 years and I have not been told of any attempt by
      the  respondent  to  remove  him.  That  suggests  that  there  is  no
      indication that his removal is now imminent.

  25. The evidence of the second appellant's father before Judge Woolley was
      that he had not explored whether or not he could  move  to  Brazil  to
      maintain face to face contact with his daughter. As the  father  of  a
      Brazilian national child there may or may not be  a  lawful  route  to
      achieving that. His failure to  investigate  that  possibility,  taken
      together with his confirmation that he is  happy  to  leave  decisions
      about his daughter to her mother and his unexplained absence from  the
      hearing, the outcome of which  would  determine  whether  or  not  his
      daughter was to remain in the United Kingdom are all factors to  which
      I have regard. There may well be a good reason why he did  not  attend
      to support his daughter's appeal and why he has not provided a witness
      statement or even a letter of support but if there is I have not  been
      told what it is.


  26. Children do move with their parent or parents to  different  countries
      and do cope with the challenges of integrating and with  interferences
      to their education. The second appellant speaks  Portuguese,  even  if
      she probably regards English now as her first language. She would have
      the assistance and support of her  mother  in  adjusting  to  life  in
      Brazil, her mother having spent most of  her  life  there  and  having
      chosen to return with the appellant between September  2004  and  July
      2008. There is a functioning education system in Brazil that she  will
      be able to access. There is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  the  first
      appellant, who has managed to support herself and  her  daughter  here
      without resource to public funds would not be able to provide for them
      both in Brazil.  Judge  Woolley  recorded  that  the  first  appellant
      attended university in Brazil and holds a  professional  qualification
      which enables her to  work  as  a  teacher  in  Brazil.  There  is  no
      suggestion that the child  has  any  special  educational,  social  or
      medical needs. She is not at a critical stage of her education. All of
      this speaks compellingly in favour of a conclusion that it  would  not
      be unreasonable to expect the second appellant  to  leave  the  United
      Kingdom.


  27. As Mr Norton  acknowledged,  there  are  factors  that  speak  in  the
      appellants' favour and point to a  different  conclusion.  The  second
      appellant was born in the United Kingdom and has  lived  most  of  her
      life here and all of her education has been in the United Kingdom. She
      has been here for nearly 9 years since returning from her single visit
      to her country of nationality. Her only experience of living in Brazil
      was when she was taken there as a baby and brought back to the  United
      Kingdom aged 4 years old.  She is unlikely to have  much  recollection
      of living there.  In the United Kingdom she continues to have  contact
      with her father but, as he has taken no steps to make it possible  for
      him to accompany his daughter to Brazil, or to identify  whether  that
      is possible, that would not continue should she move to  Brazil  other
      than by telephone which is a poor substitute for a 13  year  old  girl
      who presently has regular face to face contact with  her  father.  The
      child herself is not to be blamed for the poor immigration history  of
      her  mother.  Her  school  reports  demonstrate  that  she  is   fully
      integrated into the United Kingdom.


  28. Ultimately, when I address the question of whether it is reasonable to
      expect this Brazilian national child to  return  to  Brazil  with  her
      Brazilian  national  mother  after  a  period  of  nine  years  living
      unlawfully in the United Kingdom, having regard  to  all  the  factors
      discussed above, I am  entirely  satisfied  that  question  returns  a
      positive answer. There are two main factors that might provide support
      for a conclusion that it would not  be  reasonable,  those  being  the
      length of time the second appellant has lived in  the  United  Kingdom
      and the impact upon the contact the child presently  enjoys  with  her
      father.


  29. The fact that the second  appellant  has  lived  continuously  in  the
      United Kingdom for more than seven years  is  significant  and  weighs
      heavily in her favour and I do not underestimate the importance of it.
      But there is no evidence to suggest that she would be unable  to  cope
      with the challenge of integrating into life  in  Brazil  or  that  her
      continuing education would be adversely effected. I have no doubt that
      she will have made friendships and  built  relationships  outside  her
      home here, but as I have no evidence from her or from  her  mother  or
      father about this, I do not know what those are.


  30. The evidence of contact with her father  is  unsatisfactory,  for  the
      reasons I have explained. I accept that such contact does  take  place
      but there is no current evidence of the nature and  frequency  of  it.
      The father may well have remained in the United Kingdom for many years
      but he remains removable at any time. It may or may  not  be  possible
      for the second appellant's father to secure a lawful entry to  Brazil,
      either for the purpose of a visit to his Brazilian national  child  or
      for a longer stay, even if that means that he would not be re-admitted
      to the United Kingdom where, according  to  the  first  appellant,  he
      would  prefer  to  remain  to  enjoy  the  many  friendships  he   has
      established here. If he does not find  a  way  of  securing  entry  to
      Brazil, either for visits or on a longer term basis, then contact  can
      be maintained in other ways.

  31. The consequence of that conclusion, that this is not a case  where  it
      would not be reasonable to expect the second appellant  to  leave  the
      United Kingdom,  is that when I consider the public interest  question
      the appellants secure no assistance from s117B(6) to  balance  against
      the important consideration of s  117B(1),  that  the  maintenance  of
      immigration control is in the public interest.

  32. Requiring the appellants to leave the United Kingdom will bring  about
      an interference with their right to  respect  for  their  private  and
      family lives, as they are presently being enjoyed. Given the time they
      have both  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom,  particularly  the  second
      appellant, and the nature of their private and family lives, article 8
      of the ECHR is plainly engaged. As neither is lawfully present in  the
      United Kingdom any such interference is in accordance with the law and
      is to serve a legitimate objective.  Therefore,  the  question  to  be
      addressed  is  whether  such  interference  is  proportionate  to  the
      legitimate aim being pursued.

  33. I have identified all of the factors that  speak  in  the  appellants'
      favour but I have concluded that these are outweighed  by  the  public
      interest in maintaining immigration control. The  public  interest  in
      regulating those who  enter  and  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
      accordance with the immigration rules and domestic law is  a  powerful
      consideration reinforced by primary legislation that, of course, has a
      reach beyond any individual case. The detriment to the  appellants  is
      of a nature that can be overcome, even if the nature  of  the  private
      and family life presently enjoyed in  the  United  Kingdom  cannot  be
      replicated precisely in Brazil. I  have  no  doubt  at  all  that  the
      appellants, an educated and professionally  qualified  mother  and  an
      intelligent and diligent child, as can be seen from her school report,
      will rapidly establish themselves in Brazil where they will enjoy full
      rights of citizenship and the second appellant  can  maintain  contact
      with her father, even though, for the reasons I have  explained,  that
      will not, for the foreseeable future, be in the form of  regular  face
      to face contact.

  34. For all of these reasons I find that there would be  no  impermissible
      infringement of rights protected  by  article  8  of  the  ECHR  as  a
      consequence of the refusal to grant these appellants leave  to  remain
      in the United Kingdom.



Summary of decision:

The appeal against refusal to grant leave to remain is dismissed.
