Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr J Plowright (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny (HOPO)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Turquet, promulgated on 14th October 2013, following a hearing at
    Hatton Cross on 4th October 2013.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeals of Mr Wichramasingh Dukamahuge Hiran Tennakoon  and
    his  wife  Mrs  Chathurani  Samanjala  Perera  Happanthanthrige.    The
    Respondent Secretary of State, applied for, and was granted, permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellants

 2. The Appellants are husband and wife.  The first Appellant, the husband,
    was born on 1st March 1977.  The second Appellant, the wife,  was  born
    on 18th May 1978.  Both are citizens of Sri Lanka.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. On 6th December 2012, the first Appellant applied for leave  to  remain
    as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and the second Appellant applied  to
    remain as his dependant as a Tier 1  Migrant.   The  first  Appellant's
    application was refused on 15th July 2013 under paragraph 245DD(b)  and
    the second Appellant's application was refused on the same day in  line
    with that of her husband.  The Appellants claim that all the  necessary
    documentation had been submitted in compliance with  Rule  41-SD.   All
    the required evidence under Appendix A, such as was  required  for  the
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) category had been submitted.  In particular,  the
    company incorporation certificate, memorandum, which stated the name of
    the first Appellant as the sole director  of  the  company,  were  also
    submitted, together with various marketing materials, website  details,
    business cards, letterheads, e-mails,  communications  with  customers,
    marketing research prepared in the name of the business, Tapro  Trading
    Limited, such  as  to  allow  the  Secretary  of  State  to  grant  the
    Appellants the leave that was sought in this case.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge had regard to  the  fact  that  the  Appellant  had  provided
    sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he had access to  �50,000.   He
    had been living in the UK since 2004 and had  established  private  and
    family life.  He had now set up a company called Tapro  and  supporting
    documentation had been provided.   The  judge  held  that  Table  4  of
    Appendix 1 set out the  requirements  in  respect  of  "investment  and
    business activity" and it is stipulated here that  the  applicant  must
    have access to not less than �50,000.  The judge reviewed the  evidence
    before  him  (see  paragraphs  18  to  20)  and  held   that   in   the
    circumstances,  the  Secretary  of  State  should  have   applied   her
    Evidential Flexibility Policy if there was a missing document, such  as
    a current appointment report, because all else was  available  for  the
    Respondent Secretary of State to  see.   Given  that  "everything  else
    related to Tapro except the current appointment report" the  Respondent
    should have applied the evidential flexibility policy  and  that  there
    was a failing of a public law duty to do so in this case, such as would
    give  effect  to  the  Respondent  Secretary  of  State's  own   policy
    (paragraph  20).   On  this  basis,  the  appeal  was  allowed  of  the
    Appellants.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that the judge  wrongly  decided  that
    under the case of Rodriguez the appeal should be  allowed  because  the
    evidential flexibility policy, which was dealt with in  Rodriguez,  was
    withdrawn some two months before the determination of the judge.

 6. On 22nd May 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

 7. On 15th June 2014, however, a Rule 24 response  was  entered  by  those
    representing the Appellant, namely, by Mr Joe Plowright,  who  appeared
    before me to make oral submissions.   The  essence  of  these  Rule  24
    submissions is that the determination of Judge Turquet was  promulgated
    on 15th October 2013.  The Home Office application  for  permission  to
    appeal is dated 18th  October  2013.   However,  the  application  date
    stamped as being received by Loughborough Support Centre is 30th  April
    2014, some six months after  the  Grounds  of  Appeal  were  apparently
    drafted.  In granting permission, no regard was given by  the  Tribunal
    to this fact.

Submissions

 8. At the hearing before me on 14th July  2014,  Ms  Kenny,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of State, submitted  that  this  was
    indeed a preliminary issue before the Tribunal that needed to be  dealt
    with before she could address me on the merits of  the  appeal  by  the
    Secretary of State.  Ms Kenny submitted that given that the Grounds  of
    Appeal had been drafted timeously, they must then have  been  submitted
    timeously, so as to arrive at Loughborough timeously.   She  could  not
    understand why there had been such an extensive delay.  She  could  not
    provide an explanation as to why the date of the stamp at  Loughborough
    is some six months after the drafting of the Grounds of Appeal.

 9. For his part, Mr Plowright submitted that it was  not  enough  for  the
    Respondent to say that if  the  Grounds  of  Appeal  had  been  drafted
    timeously then they must have been sent  without  any  delay  on  their
    side.  This was a matter of conjecture and supposition.  To  make  good
    such a submission there had to be evidence before this Tribunal.

10. The Rules are clear that the Grounds of Appeal must be received by  the
    Tribunal five days after promulgation  of  the  determination  that  is
    under challenge.  Here we were looking at six months.

11. No evidence was provided of a postage envelope with a stamp on it or of
    special delivery post, or anything  like  this.   Nor,  was  there  any
    evidence from the Tribunal authorities that they had made a mistake  in
    not forwarding Grounds  of  Appeal  that  had  been  received  by  them
    timeously for the last six months.  In the circumstances,  one  had  to
    take the matter as it stood.

12. The Respondent Secretary of State could not simply blame  the  Tribunal
    unless the Tribunal were to accept responsibility, of which  there  was
    no evidence today.  There should have been an  audit  trail  confirming
    exactly what happened over the last six months.  This was non-existent.
     The Rules fell to be applied.

13. In reply, Ms Kenny referred  to  the  Tribunal  case  of  NA  (Excluded
    decisions; identifying judge) Afghanistan [2010] UKUT 444, and read out
    the head note of that determination, to say that  the  Tribunal  had  a
    right of appeal in these circumstances, which could not be  denied  it.
    However, Mr Plowright retorted by a reference to the case of Samir (FtT
    Permission to appeal: time) [2013] UKUT 00003, which he submitted dealt
    precisely and specifically with the point at issue today,  such  as  to
    allow this Tribunal to say that there was no jurisdiction to  determine
    and hear the appeal made before it today.

No Error of Law

14. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by Judge Turquet  cannot
    now be impugned because as a preliminary matter the first question  for
    this Tribunal to consider is whether the appeal  by  the  Secretary  of
    State is properly before this Tribunal.  It is not.  Although Ms  Kenny
    has  drawn  my  attention  to  the  case  of  NA  (Excluded  decisions;
    identifying judge)  Afghanistan  [2010]  UKUT  444,  Mr  Plowright  has
    directed my attention to the much more  relevant  case  of  Samir  (FtT
    Permission to appeal: time) [2013] UKUT 00003.  That case confirmed the
    longstanding jurisprudence of the courts in  the  case  of  Boktor  and
    Wanis [2011] UKUT 00442 that the grant of appeal  is  conditional,  and
    that  it  is  important  to  consider   whether   there   are   special
    circumstances which make it unjust not to extend time.   The  extension
    of time is what I am asked to do here.   There  are  no  circumstances,
    which have properly been put before me, which suggest that time  should
    be extended.  The burden of proof is on the Secretary of  State.   That
    burden of proof has not been discharged.  I have had regard to the very
    helpful skeleton argument by Mr Plowright which  extensively  sets  out
    the position, supported by authorities, in this respect.  The  decision
    to extend time is part of the original  decision  on  the  application.
    The applicable provision is to be found in Section 24 of the Asylum and
    Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005, which read that, "a  party
    seeking permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal must make a  written
    application", which was plainly  done  here,  but  there  is  also  the
    proviso that, "an application ... must be  sent  or  delivered  to  the
    Tribunal so that it is received no later than five days after the  date
    on which the party making the application is deemed to have been served
    with written reasons for the decision".

15. In this case the date of the stamp shows that it was delivered  to  the
    Tribunal some six months after it was drafted.   For  the  Tribunal  to
    extend  time  it  must  be  satisfied  "that  by  reason   of   special
    circumstances it would be unjust not to do so".  The fact of the matter
    is that there have been no "special circumstances" put before me in any
    sustainable way that would impel this Tribunal to  conclude  that  time
    should be extended.  That being so, I have no jurisdiction to  consider
    this appeal.

Decision

16. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

17. No anonymity order is made.
