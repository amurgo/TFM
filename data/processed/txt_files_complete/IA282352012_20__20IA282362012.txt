For the Appellants:    Mr A Rahman, Solicitor, of Mayfair Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. The appellants are both citizens of Nepal.   The  first  appellant  was
    born on 28 June 1979.  The second appellant, who  is  her  husband  and
    dependant, was born on 7 September 1984.

 2. The first appellant entered the UK as a student on 8 August 2009,  with
    leave to remain until 30 April  2012.   The  second  appellant  entered
    later as her dependant, with leave to remain until the same date.

 3. Before the expiry of that leave, the  appellants  applied  for  further
    leave to remain.  The first appellant applied to remain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student and the second appellant as her dependant spouse.

 4. The applications were refused by the respondent, in a decision dated 13
    November 2012.  The refusal letters  are  dated  the  same  date.   The
    respondent also made a decision to remove  the  appellants  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

 5. The sole reason for  refusal  was  that  it  was  considered  that  the
    maintenance requirements under the Rules had not been satisfied.  It is
    common ground that in addition to the course fees (which had been paid)
    the appellants had to show between them that  they  had  �2,500,  being
    �800 for two months for the first appellant and �450 per month for  two
    months for her dependant partner,  the  second  appellant.   Under  the
    Rules, the appellants had to show that they had this sum for a  28  day
    period in approved bank account or accounts ending on a  day  not  more
    than 31 days before the date of application.  In  the  refusal  letter,
    the respondent stated that the bank account submitted by the appellants
    only showed that they had been in possession of �1,946.97  during  that
    period.

 6. The appellants appealed against this decision and requested that  their
    appeals be dealt with on the papers, which they were.  The appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge P J Clarke, sitting at  Birmingham  on
    21 February 2013, but in a determination prepared on 25  February  2013
    and promulgated on 28  February  2013,  Judge  Clarke  dismissed  their
    substantive appeals, although he did find  that  the  removal  decision
    under Section 47 was not in accordance with the law.

 7. The appellants now appeal against the substantive decision,  permission
    having been granted.

 8. The grounds raise a number  of  matters,  but  for  reasons  which  are
    discussed below, it is not necessary to  refer  to  these  within  this
    determination.

 9. At the outset of the hearing before me, I expressed my preliminary view
    that this appeal should be allowed for reasons which I now set out.  In
    the course of his determination, Judge Clarke had found at paragraph 16
    that the evidence of funds  in  the  first  appellant's  Barclays  Bank
    account only showed statements up to 22 March 2012, which was more than
    31 days  before  the  date  of  application.   In  fact,  Judge  Clarke
    overlooked one page of these statements, which  went  up  to  29  March
    2012, which was within the 31 day period stipulated within  the  Rules.
    Judge Clarke also considered that the lowest balance within the 28  day
    period was �1,473.07 on 23 February 2012 (at paragraph  9).   He  found
    also that the second appellant's bank account with Everest Bank Limited
    had at the relevant times a positive  balance  of  sums  equivalent  to
    �801.42.

10. In fact, throughout the 28 day period up to 29 March  2012,  the  first
    appellant's Barclays Bank account never had less than �1,732.19 in  it,
    so that throughout the relevant period, the appellants  in  fact  never
    had below �2,500 in their combined bank accounts.  It follows that  the
    maintenance requirements had in fact been met, and that Judge  Clarke's
    failure to take account of the page of the statement from 22  March  to
    29 March 2012 showing the sums in the account during this period was  a
    material error of law, such that this determination must be  set  aside
    and re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

11. On behalf of the respondent, although  Ms  Holmes  could  not  formally
    concede the appeal, she acknowledged that there was no basis upon which
    she could properly assert that the appeal  should  be  dismissed.   She
    accepted that  Judge  Clarke  had  not  taken  proper  account  of  the
    appellants' bank accounts and that had he done so, he would have  found
    that the maintenance requirements had been satisfied.

12. I accordingly  find  that  Judge  Clarke's  determination  contained  a
    material error of law such that his decision must  be  re-made,  and  I
    shall allow the appeals.



Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The appellants' appeals are allowed, under the Immigration Rules.




Signed:                                 Dated: 4 June 2013
