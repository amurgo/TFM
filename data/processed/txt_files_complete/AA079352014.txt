Representation:
Appellant   Mr Coleman, Counsel, instructed by S Satha & Co
Respondent  Mr Kotas (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a national of Sri Lanka and he applied for asylum  and
    associated protection or reliefs.

 2. The respondent refused his application on September 24,  2014  and  the
    appellant appealed against that decision under  Section  82(1)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 3. The matter was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Afako on  June
    9, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on  July  8,  2015  the  Tribunal
    refused his appeal on all grounds including Article 8 ECHR.

 4. The appellant applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  June  22,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Resident Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Renton on August 25, 2015  only  on  the  basis  that  it  was
    arguable the Tribunal had erred in considering the appellant's  private
    life under Article 8 ECHR. In all other respects permission  to  appeal
    was refused.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal made an anonymity  direction  and  pursuant  to
    Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 I  extend
    that order.

    SUBMISSIONS

 7. Mr Coleman submitted that the Tribunal failed to consider private  life
    under paragraph 276ADE(vi) HC 395 and he submitted that in light of the
    appellant's circumstances  the  Tribunal  should  have  considered  his
    private life  under  this  provision  before  any  consideration  under
    Article 8 ECHR. By failing to do so the Tribunal materially  erred.  He
    further submitted the Tribunal had erred by failing to properly  engage
    with the evidence and in particular failed to have regard to  the  fact
    he had limited family  in  Sri  Lanka  and  was  suffering  from  post-
    traumatic stress disorder. There was no reference in  the  decision  to
    proportionality and the Article 8 assessment was cursory at best.

 8. Mr Kotas relied on the Rule 24 statement dated September  3,  2015  and
    submitted that whilst the  Tribunal  had  not  specifically  considered
    paragraph 276ADE HC 395 he submitted that the error, on  the  facts  of
    the case, was not material. The appellant had only been in  the  United
    Kingdom for 4 � years and the only basis he could bring a claim was  on
    private life. Any private life had been created  at  a  time  when  his
    immigration status was precarious due to the outright rejection of  his
    asylum claim. There was nothing within his evidence  that  demonstrated
    "very  significant"  obstacles  to  his  re-integration  and  the  same
    conclusion would have been reached on both  an  application  under  the
    Rules and Article 8.

    DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

 9. Permission to appeal had been granted to the appellant on the basis  it
    was arguable that the Tribunal had erred in its  approach  whether  the
    Tribunal had considered if the appellant had established a  significant
    private life.

10. The appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in late  December  2012
    whereupon he made an  application  for  asylum.  This  application  was
    refused and rejected with detailed reasons by both the  respondent  and
    the tribunal. Although permission to appeal was sought  in  respect  of
    this aspect of the claim in giving permission  resident  judge  of  the
    first-tier Tribunal Renton made clear there was no  error  of  law  and
    that the tribunal had properly  considered  the  medical  evidence  and
    given for the reasons credibility  findings.  The  Tribunal  also  made
    findings with regard to the appellant's mental health pointing out that
    there was no specialist medical evidence available and its  conclusions
    were open to it.

11. Ground five of the Permission to appeal specifically  raises  the  fact
    that the Tribunal failed to consider the claim under paragraph 276  ADE
    HC 395. Mr Kotas accepted that the Tribunal did not consider  paragraph
    276ADE HC 395 and the decision only addresses Article 8 from  paragraph
    55 onwards.

12. However, the argument put forward by Mr Kotas is twofold:

      a. Bearing in mind the findings made  about  the  appellant's  medical
         condition and the fact that  his  private  life  has  been  created
         whilst his immigration status was precarious means that  any  claim
         under Article 8 was bound to fail bearing in mind  section  117B(1)
         of the 2002 Act.

      b. In light of the fact the Tribunal rejected his  claim  to  have  no
         family in Sri Lanka coupled with the fact  he  has  spent  all  his
         life, apart from the last 4 � years there, then any decision  under
         paragraph 276ADE was bound to fail because there would be no  "very
         significant obstacles."

13. The difficulty facing Mr Coleman is that the First-tier Tribunal made a
    number of significant  adverse  credibility  findings  that  undermined
    arguments put forward today. Whilst I accept the Tribunal did not  make
    any findings under paragraph  276ADE  HC  395  it  is  clear  that  the
    Tribunal could only have allowed his appeal if it was  satisfied  there
    were "very significant obstacles" to his return.

14. The Tribunal rejected the scarring evidence and attached little  weight
    to the conclusion given by the appellant's GP  that  he  was  suffering
    with severe post-traumatic stress disorder and permission to appeal  on
    this issue was refused.

15. At paragraph  [56]  of  its  decision  the  Tribunal  referred  to  the
    appellant identifying at least one uncle living in Sri Lanka and  there
    was no evidence, in light of the rejection of  his  claim,  that  there
    were "very significant obstacles" to his  return.  Accordingly,  whilst
    the Tribunal erred by not considering his claim under  the  Immigration
    Rules I am satisfied that this would not have been  material  based  on
    the Tribunal's findings because there was no basis for the Tribunal  to
    find there were "very significant obstacles" in light of the  wholesale
    rejection of the other issues raised by him.

16. As regards a standalone Article 8 claim, the  Tribunal  had  regard  to
    part 5A of the 2002 Act and stated in paragraph [57]  of  its  decision
    that none of the relevant considerations were in the appellant's favour
    and section 117B(1) of  the  2002  Act  makes  clear  that  immigration
    control is in the public interest.

17. I therefore find on the evidence before the first Tier  Tribunal  there
    was no material error.
