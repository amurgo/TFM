Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Rothwell instructed by Bureau for Migrant
                    Advice and Policy
For the Respondent:    Ms S Sreeraman, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. The appellant, a national of Syria and the  United  States  of  America,
   appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  the
   Secretary of State to refuse her application for leave to remain and  to
   remove her from the UK. First-tier Tribunal Judge C M Phillips dismissed
   the appeal  and  the  appellant  now  appeal  with  permission  to  this
   Tribunal.

2. The background to this appeal is not in dispute. The  appellant  is  now
   aged 82. According to her statement, between 1960 and 1994 she lived  in
   various parts of the world with her husband as he worked  for  the  Arab
   League and then the United Nations. When her husband retired in 1994 the
   couple returned to live in Aleppo in Syria where the appellant still has
   a home. When the couple were visiting the UK in May 2006 the appellant's
   husband suffered a heart attack and died and his body was flown back  to
   Syria for burial. The appellant's sister lives in Geneva. She has  three
   sons. The oldest lives in Saudi Arabia, the middle son lives in New York
   and the youngest lives in the UK where he is married  with  2  children.
   The appellant has a UN pension and has UN  provided  health  care.   The
   appellant says that, although she has US citizenship she has  not  lived
   there  since  2000.  Since  about  2010/2011  the  appellant  has   been
   travelling from one relative to another until  the  situation  in  Syria
   improves. The appellant travelled to the UK in January 2013 with a visit
   visa giving her leave to enter until 11 July 2013. She says that she has
   grown weak over the last few years and that  she  now  needs  help  with
   everyday tasks. She suffers from glaucoma, hypertension,  dizziness  and
   memory loss and in early 2014 she had a fall. She says that as a  result
   of this deterioration she is completely dependant on  her  son  and  his
   wife in the UK. She says that she cannot live  with  her  son  in  Saudi
   Arabia as he has diplomatic status and  is  therefore  not  entitled  to
   obtain the required visa for her. She says that she cannot live with her
   son in the USA as he and his wife work erratic hours and live in one-bed
   roomed accommodation and therefore cannot provide her with the care  she
   needs.

3. It was accepted by the appellant's representative before the  First-tier
   Tribunal that the  appellant  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
   relevant Immigration Rules. The First-tier Tribunal Judge therefore went
   on to consider the appeal under Article 8 of the European Convention  on
   Human Rights. The First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  firstly  found  that  the
   appellant has not established a family life in the UK. She  went  on  to
   find that, if she was wrong about that, any interference does not engage
   Article 8 but that if it does removal is proportionate to the legitimate
   aim. The Judge  considered  whether  the  appellant  has  established  a
   private life in the UK. She said at paragraph 37;

       "In line with Nasim I remind myself of the limited utility of Article
       8 in private life cases such as the appellant's that are far  removed
       from the protection of an individual's moral and physical  integrity.
       ..."

4. The Judge found that Article 8 is  not  engaged  on  the  basis  of  the
   appellant's private life but in the alternative the appellant's  removal
   would be proportionate if she has established a private life.

Error of law

5. The grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal  contend  that  the  Judge
   applied too high a standard  in  finding  that  the  appellant  had  not
   established a family life in the UK as the threshold is  relatively  low
   (as per AG (Eritrea)v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2007]
   EWCA Civ 801). It is further contended that the Judge failed to identify
   the public interest in removing the appellant in her  circumstances.  Ms
   Rothwell submitted that in considering the  public  interest  the  Judge
   should have considered section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and
   Asylum Act 2002. She submitted that the Judge  had  not  carried  out  a
   proper balancing exercise in considering her alternative findings as  to
   proportionality.

6. Ms Sreeraman submitted that the Judge directed herself appropriately and
   gave due weight to the Immigration Rules. She submitted that  the  Judge
   did have due regard to  the  public  interest  and  undertook  a  proper
   proportionality assessment.

7. I am satisfied that the Judge did make a material error of  law  in  her
   consideration of this appeal. The Judge failed to give adequate  reasons
   for finding that there is no family life in this case. This appellant is
   a woman in her 80s with health problems requiring care and assistance in
   her daily life who has been living with her son and his family in the UK
   since January 2013. In light of the failure  to  adequately  reason  the
   decision that there is no  family  life  the  alternative  findings  are
   inadequate. In considering proportionality the  Judge  has  not  engaged
   with the issues in the case or carried  out  a   proper  proportionality
   balancing exercise.

8. I therefore set the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  decision  aside  and
   remake it. In setting the decision  aside  I  note  that  there  was  no
   factual dispute and the findings of fact up to  the  end  of  the  third
   sentence in paragraph 33 of the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision are
   preserved.

Remaking the decision

9. In remaking the decision I note that it was accepted that the  appellant
   cannot meet the requirements of he Immigration Rules. She was in the  UK
   as a visitor at the time of her application and her  status  means  that
   she cannot meet the requirements of Appendix FM as  an  Adult  Dependant
   Relative.

10. Recent case law including R (Nagre) v  SSHD  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin),
   Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) Pakistan [2013]  UKUT
   640 (IAC), Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) and R
   (MM & Others) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 make it clear that there  is  a
   need to look at the evidence to see if there is anything which  has  not
   already been adequately considered in the  context  of  the  Immigration
   Rules and which could lead to a successful Article 8 claim.

11. In the circumstances of this  case  I  am  satisfied  that  all  of  the
   factors of this case have  not  been  adequately  considered  under  the
   Immigration Rules and I go on to consider the appeal under Article 8.

12. In considering the case under Article 8 I consider the 5 stages set  out
   in R v SSHD ex parte Razgar [2004] UKHL 27  Lord  Bingham  set  out  the
   following five questions to be addressed where removal  is  resisted  in
   reliance on Article 8;

       (1) Will  the  proposed  removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
       authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to  respect  for
       his private or family life?
       (2) If so, will such interference have consequences of such gravity
       as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
       (3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?
       (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society in
       the interests of national security, public safety or the economic
       well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime,
       for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the
       rights and freedoms of others?
       (5) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate
       public end sought to be achieved?

13. In relation to question (1) I take into account of  the  fact  that  the
   appellant has been living with her son,  his  wife  and  their  children
   since January 2013, a period of almost two years and that prior to  that
   she has spent a lot of time with her  family  in  the  UK.  I  take  the
   medical evidence into account.  I  accept  that  the  appellant  is  now
   dependant on her  son  and  daughter-in-law  for  her  daily  care.  The
   appellant is 82 years old and by virtue of her age and health conditions
   dependant on the help of her family. In  these  circumstances  I  accept
   that the ties between the appellant and her son and his family are  more
   than the usual emotional ties between adult family  members.  Given  the
   low threshold I am satisfied that there will  be  an  interference  with
   that family life if the appellant is removed from the UK (question (2)).
   As she does not meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  the
   answer to question (3) is that the decision is in  accordance  with  the
   law.

14. Questions (4) and (5) go to the  proportionality  of  the  decision.  In
   considering the public interest I take account  of  the  fact  that  the
   appellant cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules  as  an
   Adult  Dependant  Relative  because  of  her  immigration  status.   The
   appellant entered the UK in a temporary capacity, as a visitor  and  now
   seeks to remain on a long term basis. According to the papers before  me
   the appellant is a national of Syria. It has not been suggested  by  the
   respondent that it would be reasonable to expect her  to  return  there.
   She is also a national of the USA and could live  there  as  she  has  a
   pension. She could also access  medical  care  there  under  her  health
   insurance. If she was removed to the USA she  would  have  some  support
   from her son there, albeit she would be  unable  to  live  with  him  or
   receive day-to-day care from him. Her sons  are  all  professionals  and
   could provide her with financial support if she were in the USA.

15. In considering the public interest, that  is  whether  the  interference
   with the appellant's private and family life is justified under  Article
   8(2) of the ECHR, I must have regard to the factors set out  in  section
   117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. This  provides
   as follows;

       '(1) The maintenance of effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the
       public interest.
       (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests
       of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
       seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able to speak
       English because persons who can speak English-
          (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and
          (b) are better able to integrate into society.
       (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interest
       of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who
       seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are financially
       independent, because such persons-
          (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and
          (b) are better able to integrate into society.
       (4) Little weight should be given to -
          (a) a private life, or
          (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,
          that is established by a person at a time when the person is in
          the United Kingdom unlawfully.
       (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by a
       person at a time when the person's immigration status is precarious.
       (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
       public interest does not require the person's removal where -
          (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
          with a qualifying child, and
          (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the
          United Kingdom.'

16. In considering section  117B  I  take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
   appellant speaks English, this was not disputed  by  Ms  Sreeraman.  The
   appellant has a pension of around $900  (about  �600)  a  month  and  is
   accommodated  by  her  son  who  is  in  employment.  She  is  therefore
   financially independent. The appellant's family life was not established
   when she was in the UK unlawfully. These are all factors which weigh  in
   the appellant's favour. However against that I take account of the  fact
   that her family life in the UK was established during  previous  periods
   with leave to enter as a visitor and during and after her last period of
   entry as a visitor. If she were to be removed to the USA the appellant's
   UK based son and his family could visit her there.

17. As against the public interest I weigh the appellant's advanced age  and
   health  circumstances.  She  has  private  health   insurance   and   is
   financially independent and will not therefore be a burden on the state.
   Her family have been caring for her and intend to and  are  willing  and
   able to continue to provide that care. The appellant last lived  in  the
   USA in 2000 when she was younger and fitter. She would be unable to live
   with her son there because of the size of his accommodation and his work
   commitments. She cannot go to live with her son in Saudi  Arabia.  There
   is no suggestion that she could return  to  live  in  Aleppo  where  her
   family home is and  where  her  husband  is  buried.  According  to  her
   statement the appellant  still  hopes  to  return  to  Syria.  The  only
   realistic alternative option to remaining with  her  family  in  the  UK
   would be for her to go to the USA  and  secure  supported  accommodation
   there. Given her age and health issues this would be very difficult  for
   her. Many of the factors  in  section  117B  weigh  in  the  appellant's
   favour.

18. Weighing the public interest in this case against all of the factors  in
   the appellant's favour I am satisfied that  the  balance  falls  on  the
   appellant's side in the particular circumstances of this case.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error on point of law.

I set the decision aside preserving the findings of fact.

I remake the decision by allowing the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR.
