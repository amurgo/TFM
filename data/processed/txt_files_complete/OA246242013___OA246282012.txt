Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   No Representation or Appearance


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. For the purposes of this determination I will refer to the parties  in
      the style they were referred to before the First-Tier Tribunal.

   2. No representative appeared for the appellants.  A letter was  received
      dated  5  August  2014  from  solicitors  previously  instructed.  The
      contents of that letter indicate that  the  appellants  would  not  be
      represented at the hearing before the  Upper  Tribunal  "due  to  cost
      reasons".  The sponsor did not attend.

   3. In the circumstances I considered it appropriate to  proceed  to  deal
      with the appeal, noting of course that the  appellants  are  residents
      outside the United Kingdom. The notice of hearing having been properly
      served and acknowledged by the letter mentioned above.

   4. The appellants are both citizens of China  and  are  mother  and  son.
      They originally appealed against  decisions  of  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer dated 5 October 2012 refusing entry clearance  for  settlement
      as wife and child of a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  United
      Kingdom.  The respondent considered the application  by  reference  to
      Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, but decided that the sponsor did
      not meet the financial requirements of those rules as at the  date  of
      application.  The application therefore failed  to  be  refused  under
      paragraph EC-P.1.1.(d) of Appendix FM.

   5. The appellants appealed those decisions and the appeal  was  heard  at
      Taylor House on 8 May 2014 before Judge  of  the  First-Tier  Tribunal
      Bird.  Each party was represented.

   6. In a determination promulgated on 20 May 2014 Judge Bird recorded that
      it had been accepted on behalf of the appellants  that  they  did  not
      meet  the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  because  of  the
      sponsor's income (�14,506 per annum as opposed to a requirement  under
      the rules of �22,400).

   7. Judge Bird then went on to  consider  Article  8  ECHR  with  specific
      reference to the High Court case  of  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin).
      Whilst  this  was  a  High  Court  case  reference  is  made  in   the
      determination to it being an Upper Tribunal case.  Reference  is  also
      made to the question posed in that case as to whether the  appellant's
      arrival in the United Kingdom would cause a further recourse to public
      funds.

   8. At paragraph 11 a submission by the appellant's rep is  recorded  that
      there were good reason why Article 8 should be considered.  The  judge
      allowed the appeal under Article 8 whilst dismissed the  appeal  under
      the Immigration Rules.

   9. The respondent then sought leave to appeal alleging one  ground  being
      that the judge had made material misdirection in  law  by  failing  to
      properly deal with the case by reference to guidance set  out  in  the
      cases of R (Nagre) v  Home  Secretary  [2013]  EWHC  720  (Admin)  and
      Gulshan [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC).  Reference is also made to  the  case
      of MM which the grounds allege was "an unsafe authority".

  10. In granting permission to  appeal  another  judge  of  the  First-Tier
      Tribunal gave the following as reasons:

         "1.  The respondent seeks permission to appeal against the decision
      of the First-Tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Bird)  who,  in  a  determination
      promulgated on 20th May 2014, allowed the appellant's  appeal  against
      the respondent's decision to refuse the  appellant's  application  for
      leave to enter the United Kingdom under the immigration rules  as  the
      child of a person settled here.

      2. This appeal was linked with that of appeal number OA/24624/2012.


      3. In summary the respondent's Grounds and Reasons for  Permission  to
         Appeal submit that the judge made a material misdirection in law:


         a.   The judge allowed the appeal  under  article  8  ECHR  without
             having found  that  there  are  compelling  circumstances  not
             sufficiently recognised under  the  rules  as  per  R  (Nagre)
             [2013].


         b.   The judge has failed to identify  the  nature  of  "compelling
             circumstances not sufficiently recognised under the rules".


         c.   There has been no analysis by the judge of why  the  appellant
             cannot submit a further application.


         d.   The secretary of state is entitled to  set  a  minimum  income
             threshold; the appellant can submit a further application once
             the sponsor and demonstrate  the  financial  requirements  are
             met.


         e.   The judge attached weights to a material matters such  as  the
             fact that the appellant submitted their application a few days
             earlier their applications would probably have been successful
             under the old rules.  This is speculative.


         f.   The judge had a particular regard to the case of MM  therefore
             the judge is relying upon and unsafe authority.

      4. Permission to appeal can only be granted if  I  am  satisfied  that
         there was a material error of law that would have made  a  material
         difference to the outcome of the original appeal.   This  could  be
         due to adverse or irrational findings or a lack of findings on core
         issues as established in the case of R (Iran  etc)  v  SSHD  [2005]
         EWCA Civ 982.


      5.  When considering the determination it is arguable that  the  judge
         has made a material error in  law  in  the  determination  for  the
         reasons outlined in the respondent's application".

  11. Hence the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal.

  12. Mr Deller referred to the grounds seeking leave.  He did not make  any
      further verbal submission.

  13. At this stage I indicated to  Mr  Deller  (there  being  no  one  else
      present) that I considered there was a material error of law contained
      within the determination of Judge Bird and that her decision to  allow
      the appeal must be set aside.  I indicated that I proposed  to  remake
      the decision, but that I would reserve that decision which I now  give
      and explain.

  14. The grounds seeking leave can be summarised  in  two  parts.   Firstly
      that the judge failed to properly direct herself with  regard  to  the
      Rules/Article 8.  Secondly that she relied upon  what  the  respondent
      has described as an unsafe authority.  In fact the High Court case  of
      MM has now been overturned by the Court of Appeal in the case that can
      now be referred to as MM (Lebanon) [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  This case  in
      effect overturns the views of Blake J by holding that the Secretary of
      State is entitled to fix the required level of income under the  Rules
      (in this case �22,400 per annum).

  15. Having found that the appellants could not meet  the  requirements  of
      Appendix FM the judge was then required to consider the merits of  the
      human rights claim in accordance with the  approach  set  out  by  the
      Court of Appeal in MF (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, the  High  Court
      is Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and by the Upper Tribunal in  Gulshan
      [2013] UKUT 640 has also confirmed by Shahzad (Article 8 -  Legitimate
      Aim) [2014] UKUT 0085 (IAC).  These judgments have made it clear  that
      the question of proportionality must be looked at in  the  context  of
      the Immigration Rules with no need to go on to a  specific  assessment
      under Article 8 if it is clear  from  the  facts  that  there  are  no
      particular compelling  or  exceptional  circumstances  requiring  that
      course to be taken.  This approach has been further confirmed  by  the
      Court of Appeal in the more recent case of Haleemundeen v SSHD  [2014]
      EWCA Civ 558.

  16. As alleged in the grounds seeking leave Judge  Bird  failed  to  adopt
      this approach, though I do note at paragraph 15 of  the  determination
      reference is made to "good reason".  With respect I  do  not  consider
      that is a sufficient bridge to allow a stand  alone  consideration  of
      Article 8.  The remainder of the determination focuses on the question
      of public  funds,  whereas  what  is  needed  is  a  consideration  of
      particular compelling or exceptional  circumstances.   In  failing  to
      adopt this, the judge erred in material way and  her  decision  cannot
      stand.

  17. Turning now to the remaking of the  decision,  I  have  no  additional
      evidence or indeed submissions  that  any  exceptional  of  compelling
      circumstance exists.  The appellants through their representative have
      had notice of the proceedings before the Upper  Tribunal;  no  further
      information has been forthcoming.

  18. I am conscious of the age of the second appellant.  I  have  read  the
      statements that were before Judge Bird and the skeleton  argument.   I
      note the skeleton argument  did  deal  with  the  cases  that  I  have
      referred to above and does indeed refer to the  need  for  "compelling
      circumstances".  However, I can find no such particular compelling  or
      exceptional circumstances for either appellant  that  would  enable  a
      stand alone Article 8 consideration to take place.

  19. It has been acknowledged that the appellants cannot succeed under  the
      Rules; neither can they succeed under Article 8.

  20. The decision of Judge Bird contained a material error of  law  and  is
      set aside.  I remake the decision  dismissing  the  appeal  under  the
      Immigration Rules and dismissing the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.
