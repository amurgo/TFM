1.  The parties to an appeal are entitled to expect the  Judge  both  to  be
alert during the hearing and to appear to be so. Consequently,  if  a  Judge
actually falls asleep or gives the appearance of not giving the  appeal  his
full attention, there may be grounds for setting aside the determination  on
the basis that there has not been a fair hearing.

2.  It is preferable for any concern about the behaviour or  inattention  of
the Judge to be raised at the hearing.

3.  When such a ground of appeal is raised, it is only likely to succeed if
there is cogent evidence of the actual or apparent behaviour in question.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1. The Appellant in this case wishes to come to the UK to join his  sponsors
   - one of his brothers, SM, and his nephew, FM. He relies on paragraph 317
   of  the  Immigration  Rules  which  allows,  in  certain   circumstances,
   dependent relatives to be granted entry clearance.  The  Entry  Clearance
   Officer refused the application on 9 March 2009. The  Appellant  appealed
   on the ground that he did satisfy the Immigration Rules and also  on  the
   ground that refusal was contrary to Article 8 of the European  Convention
   on Human Rights, but on 8 December 2009 Immigration Judge D dismissed the
   appeal. On 18 January 2010 Senior Immigration Judge Waumsley ordered that
   the appeal be reconsidered.


2. The Appellant is an Afghan national. He gives his  date  of  birth  as  1
   January 1940 which would have made him  69  at  the  date  of  the  ECO's
   decision. He suffers from some mental disability or illness and has  done
   so since his birth. Its exact nature is unknown but it has the effect  of
   leading him to behave like a young child. The  ECO  had  been  unable  to
   interview the Appellant but he accepted that he did have this disability.
   In addition to his brother in the UK, the Appellant has a number of other
   siblings. He has a sister, S, who lives in Kabul. She is married and  has
   a large number of children of her own. The sponsors'  evidence  was  that
   she did not have the ability to look after the Appellant.

3. One of the Appellant's other brothers, NM,  had  lived  in  Pakistan.  He
   fled to the USA because of persecution  by  Taliban  terrorists  and  was
   granted political asylum there. NM had left behind in Pakistan his  wife,
   ZM, and their five children. The Appellant lived with ZM, his  sister-in-
   law, in Islamabad. Before 2007 NM had supported his wife, their  children
   and the Appellant. After that, the UK sponsors said that they  had  taken
   over responsibility for supporting the Appellant. FM owned  a  take  away
   pizza business which gave him an income in  the  region  of  �28,000.  He
   rented a three bedroom house where he lived with his wife and three young
   children. SM worked at the same pizza business and earned �340 per month.
   He lived in a four bedroom house with his wife  and  two  children.  Both
   sponsors offered to accommodate the Appellant.

4. So far as is material, paragraph 317 says:

           'The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite leave
           to enter ... the UK as the ....dependent relative  of  a  person
           present and settled in the UK are that the  person:


           (i) is related to a person present and settled in the UK in  one
           of the following ways:


           ....


                 (f) the ...brother, uncle...over the age of  18  if  living
                 alone outside the UK in the most exceptional  compassionate
                 circumstances and mainly dependent financially on relatives
                 settled in the UK; and

           (ii) is joining or accompanying a  person  who  is  present  and
           settled in the UK or who is on the same occasion being  admitted
           for settlement; and


           (iii) is financially wholly or mainly dependent on the  relative
           present and settled in the UK; and


           (iv) can, and will, be accommodated  adequately,  together  with
           any dependants, without recourse to public funds; and


           (iva) can, and will, be maintained adequately, together with any
           dependants, without recourse to public funds; and


           (v) has no other close relatives  to  whom  he  could  turn  for
           financial support...'


 5. The ECO refused the application for a number of  reasons.  He  did  not
    accept that the Appellant was related as claimed to the  two  sponsors.
    There was no evidence that the sponsors had sent money to the Appellant
    or visited him. It appeared to the ECO that the Appellant was dependent
    on support from his brother NM. The ECO was not satisfied  either  that
    the sponsors  could  maintain  or  accommodate  the  Appellant  without
    recourse to public funds. The ECO commented that NM  who  had  provided
    the Appellant with financial and emotional support had gone  by  choice
    to the USA. The inability of the Appellant to join NM in  the  USA  was
    not a good reason to grant him entry clearance to come to the  UK.  The
    Appellant also had a sister in Kabul.


 6.  At  least  some  of  these  reasons  appear  to  be  related  to   the
    disappearance of a bundle of documents which those acting on behalf  of
    the Appellant had sent  to  the  ECO.  Judge  D  did  accept  that  the
    Appellant was related as he claimed to the two UK sponsors. He accepted
    that the Appellant could be  maintained  and  accommodated  in  the  UK
    without recourse to public funds. He  did  not,  however,  accept  that
    either of the sponsors had been  sending  regular  remittances  to  the
    Appellant and so he did not accept that they had been  responsible  for
    his maintenance while he was  in  Pakistan.  He  thought  that  NM  had
    continued to support the Appellant as  well  as  his  (NM's)  wife  and
    children in Pakistan. He did not accept that the  Appellant  would,  if
    entry clearance was refused, be living alone in  the  most  exceptional
    compassionate circumstances. He currently  lived  with  NM's  wife  and
    children and Judge  D  did  not  accept  that  they  had  been  granted
    residence in the USA. He concluded 'On the basis of my findings of fact
    I am satisfied that the refusal of the application does  not  interfere
    with the family life the appellant enjoys in Pakistan.'


First  stage  reconsideration:  was  there  legal   error   in   Judge   D's
determination?


 7. The grounds for seeking reconsideration can be summarised in this way:

        a. At a number of points during the hearing Judge D appeared to  be
           falling asleep. He either did not, or  gave  the  appearance  of
           not, giving the appeal his full attention.
        b. The determination contains a  number  of  factual  errors.  This
           reinforced the first concern. It was also an independent  ground
           of appeal.
        c. The treatment of the Article 8 ground of appeal was  perfunctory
           and insufficiently reasoned.

Actual or apparent inattention


 8. At the hearing before Judge D, the Appellant was represented by Ms Cole-
    Wilson, counsel. She has provided a statement  in  which  she  says  as
    follows:


           'Upon entering the hearing room and  on  at  least  two  further
           occasions during the hearing, the Immigration Judge appeared  to
           be sleeping. Upon Counsel for the Appellant and the 1st  sponsor
           (the  Appellant's  brother)  entering  the  court  room  in  the
           presence of the usher, the Immigration Judge's  head  was  bowed
           and it took what appeared to be at least 20  seconds  before  he
           acknowledged  the  presence   of   the   part...There   was   no
           representative on behalf of the Respondent in attendance.


           On  at  least  two  further  occasions  during   evidence,   the
           Immigration Judge appeared to bow his head and  close  his  eyes
           for what appeared to be up to 10 seconds  each  time.  This  was
           noticed and commented upon by the sponsors following the hearing
           and counsel duly noted her brief's back sheet to this effect.'


    The back sheet does indeed contain a contemporary note which says  that
    'Judge appeared to be sleeping  both  on  entering  the  court  and  at
    various times during the hearing.' The application for reconsideration,
    which was settled by Ms Cole-Wilson on 3 January 2009, and so  about  6
    weeks after the hearing on 20 November 2009, included comments  to  the
    same effect.


    SM and FM have provided witness statements  confirming  what  Ms  Cole-
    Wilson has said.


 9. As we have  said,  the  allegation  that  the  determination  contained
    factual inaccuracies is relied on in support of this ground as well. In
    the course of his determination, Judge D said:


           (i)   'The UK sponsor's son  produced  financial  statements.  I
           have accepted that he has the ability to maintain the appellant,
           although his annual earnings do not exceed �8,000'


           In fact the person to  whom  Judge  D  was  referring  (FM)  had
           provided evidence that his income was �28,000.


           (ii) Referring to NM, Judge D said, 'There  is  no  evidence  to
           show that all his family have been granted  permission  to  join
           him in the United Kingdom...There is no documentary evidence  to
           show that that the appellant's [sic] has  made  an  unsuccessful
           application to join his brother  in  the  United  Kingdom....The
           application is based on the assertion that those members of  his
           family living with him have all been granted leave to enter  the
           United Kingdom ...'


    Each of these three references to the United Kingdom should  have  been
    to the United States.


10. Judge D was asked to comment on the grounds of appeal. He said 'I  [am]
    dumbfounded by the allegations. Let me  state  at  the  outset  that  I
    emphatically deny the claim that I fell asleep at any time  during  the
    proceedings I am unable to fathom what conduct on my  part  could  have
    given rise to such a perception. If I believed that there was any truth
    in the allegations I would have no difficulty at all in admitting  them
    and taking corrective measures.' He accepts that the determination  did
    make the errors to which we have referred in  the  previous  paragraph.
    However, he says that it can be seen from his notes of the  proceedings
    (which he has provided) that he made an accurate contemporaneous record
    of the evidence and submissions in the course of the proceedings.


11. We asked Mr Walker, the Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  whether  he
    wished to have the opportunity to cross examine Ms Cole-Wilson  on  her
    statement. He said that he did not.

12. Mr Davison on  the  Appellant's  behalf  asked  us  to  find  that  the
    Appellant had not had a fair hearing, either because Judge D had fallen
    asleep and actually allowed his attention to wander, or because he  had
    given the impression that he had and justice should be seen to be  done
    as well as done.

13. Now that we have seen Judge D's notes of the evidence we do  not  think
    that the errors in the determination help  to  establish  that  he  was
    actually asleep. He does on a number of occasions  properly  record  in
    his notes that it was the aspiration of NM's family to join him in  the
    United States rather than the United Kingdom. The notes of evidence  do
    not include the accurate amount of FM's income, but that may be because
    the amount was not referred to in the course of the hearing.

14. However, whether Judge D actually fell asleep is not  the  end  of  the
    matter. A similar point arose in Stansbury v Datapulse plc  [2004]  ICR
    523 CA where it  was  alleged  that  one  of  the  lay  members  of  an
    Employment Tribunal had fallen asleep. Peter Gibson LJ said at [28]

           'The Employment Tribunal in Kudrath v  Ministry  of  Defence  26
           April 1999 were, in my judgment, right to say that  it  was  the
           duty of the tribunal  to  be  alert  during  the  whole  of  the
           hearing, and to appear to be so. It seems to me that an  analogy
           with cases  of  bias  is  appropriate.  In  cases  of  bias  the
           appearance of bias, as observed through the eyes and ears  of  a
           fair-minded and informed observer, will vitiate a hearing:  see,
           for example, Porter v Magill [2002] AC 357, 494 per Lord Hope of
           Craighead. A member of a tribunal who  does  not  appear  to  be
           alert to what is being said in the course of a hearing may cause
           that hearing to be held to be unfair, because the hearing should
           be by a tribunal each member of which is  concentrating  on  the
           case before him or her. That is the position, as I see it, under
           English law, quite apart from the European Convention  on  Human
           Rights. It is reinforced by article 6(1) of the Convention....'

15. It is preferable for such a complaint to be  made  swiftly  before  the
    Tribunal in question. That should allow the difficulty to  be  remedied
    and for the hearing to continue effectively and fairly. In  turn,  that
    will save the expense and delay of an appeal. However, as the Court  of
    Appeal also said in Stansbury at [23]:


           'It is always desirable that a point on  the  behaviour  of  the
           employment tribunal be raised at the employment tribunal in  the
           course of the hearing, but it is unrealistic  not  to  recognise
           the difficulty, even for legal representatives, in raising  with
           the employment tribunal a complaint about the  behaviour  of  an
           employment tribunal member who, if the complaint is not  upheld,
           may yet be part of the employment tribunal deciding the case.'


16. In ordering reconsideration, SIJ  Waumsley  alluded  to  the  need  for
    cogent evidence to make  out  a  complaint  of  this  kind.  We  agree.
    However, we consider in this case that  there  is  sufficient  evidence
    that Judge D gave at least the appearance of not giving the hearing the
    attention that  it  required.  We  have  in  mind  in  particular,  the
    contemporary note on her brief by Ms Cole-Wilson, her detailed  account
    of the events in the grounds  of  appeal  which  were  drafted  shortly
    afterwards and supported in due course by her own statement  and  those
    of the two sponsors. There was no HOPO present at the hearing  and  the
    usher was not present throughout. Mr Walker has not sought to challenge
    any of the witnesses on this matter. Finally, while the mistakes in the
    determination do not speak directly to Judge D's ability to record  the
    evidence, they hardly inspire confidence that this  was  an  appeal  to
    which he gave the attention which the parties were entitled to expect.


17. Accordingly, we determine that  the  Appellant  did  not  have  a  fair
    hearing before the Immigration  Judge.  That  alone  is  sufficient  to
    require us to proceed to the second stage of the  reconsideration,  but
    we will comment briefly on the other grounds.


Factual errors


18. There is no dispute that Judge D was in error in the matters  to  which
    we have referred in paragraph 9. Of these, possibly the first  was  the
    most important. This is because the Judge may have been  influenced  by
    the size of the earnings of the UK family members  in  concluding  that
    they had not made the remittances to the Appellant which were  claimed.
    If FM had been earning just �8,000 pa that may have been a fair  point.
    It lost very much of his force if, as was the evidence, he was  earning
    over three times that amount. Judge D properly  observes  that  in  his
    review of the evidence at paragraph 4(b) he said that FM's business had
    yielded annual earnings of �28,000. In addition, it  is  fair  to  note
    that Judge D recorded that FM had not claimed that  he  personally  had
    remitted money to the Appellant. However, that still leaves uncertainty
    as to whether the Judge had the correct figure in mind when he made his
    finding on the totality of the resources available to the UK family  to
    make remittances.


19. A more fundamental difficulty for the Appellant is  that  these  errors
    would not be material if they  stood  alone:  they  do  not  touch  the
    question as to whether the Appellant satisfied the requirement  in  the
    Immigration Rules of living alone in the most exceptional compassionate
    circumstances.

20. We would not have found that  the  factual  errors  alone  amounted  to
    material errors of law.

Article 8

21. All that the Judge said about Article  8  was,  'On  the  basis  of  my
    findings of fact I am satisfied that the  refusal  of  the  application
    does not interfere  with  the  family  life  the  appellant  enjoys  in
    Pakistan.'


22. In our judgment this was plainly inadequate.  It  puts  the  issue  the
    wrong way round. The Appellant's complaint  was  not  that  refusal  of
    entry clearance would interfere with the  family  life  he  enjoyed  in
    Pakistan, but that refusal would interfere with his  family  life  with
    his relations in the UK. Even  if  it  was  to  be  inferred  that  the
    Immigration Judge did not make this mistake, the  single  sentence  did
    not adopt the structured approach required  by  cases  such  as  Razgar
    [2004] 2 AC 368. In our view, Mr Walker rightly conceded that this  was
    an error of law.

23. For this reason and because of the unfairness  of  the  hearing  before
    Judge D for the reasons that we have  given,  we  must  reconsider  the
    merits  of  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  refusal  of   entry
    clearance.

Second Stage: Should the  appeal  against  refusal  of  entry  clearance  be
allowed?

24. Having had the opportunity  to  review  the  documentation,  Mr  Walker
    accepted that the Appellant was related as claimed to his two sponsors.
    Mr Walker accepted that the Appellant was wholly or mainly dependent on
    relatives who were present and settled in the UK. The sponsors' ability
    and willingness to maintain the Appellant in the UK without recourse to
    public funds was also accepted. Although Mr Walker  initially  did  not
    accept that they had adequate accommodation, having heard the  evidence
    of FM and SM, he also agreed that they could accommodate the  Appellant
    without recourse to public funds. What, therefore, remained in  dispute
    (before oral evidence was called) was whether the Appellant was  living
    alone in the most exceptional compassionate circumstances. We  turn  to
    consider the evidence on this issue.


25. SM gave evidence before us through a Dari interpreter. He confirmed the
    contents of his witness statement of 16th November 2009. Amongst  other
    things, this had said 'Due to the Appellant's fragile state of mind  my
    brother has told his wife  to  stay  with  the  Appellant  pending  the
    outcome of this application.  It  is  absolutely  imperative  that  the
    Appellant's vulnerability is understood hence the reason for my sister-
    in-law having to separate from her husband in the interim  and  staying
    behind with the Appellant. He cannot be left behind on his own as he is
    a danger to himself. There is nobody to look after him in  Afghanistan.
    My sister living in Kabul has her own family commitments and  finds  it
    very hard with her own family and cannot do anything for him.'

26. SM added that his sister-in-law, Z, had twice cancelled visits  to  the
    American Embassy to collect the visas for her and  her  5  children  to
    emigrate to the USA. They now had an appointment to go on 24 May  2010.
    If they all went to the USA, there would only be the Appellant left  in
    Pakistan. There were no  other  family  members  in  Pakistan  and  the
    Appellant would not be able to live on his own. The Appellant  had  had
    mental disabilities since his birth  and  had  never  grown  out  of  a
    childhood state. In Afghanistan there was only his and the  Appellant's
    sister. She could not look after  the  Appellant  because  of  her  own
    family commitments. She had a husband and 6  -  7  children  aged  from
    about 7 - 18. They lived  in  just  three  rooms  (with  a  very  small
    kitchenette, bathroom and toilet). In any  case,  in  their  culture  a
    woman did not look after a man. There  was  no  cross  examination.  In
    answer to questions from the Tribunal SM said that his brother, NM, and
    sister-in-law, Z, had 5 children. The oldest was about 26. NM had  been
    told that all the work towards getting the visas had been completed for
    his wife and all of their children. The only delay had been because  of
    the Appellant's  situation.  None  of  Z's  children  were  working  in
    Pakistan.

27. FM gave evidence in English. He confirmed the accuracy of  his  witness
    statement of 16 November 2009 which had corroborated  what  his  father
    had had to say about the Appellant's position  in  Pakistan.  He,  too,
    said that Z and her children in  Pakistan  were  expecting  to  receive
    visas to travel to the USA. Their passports had been with the  American
    embassy for some time and so the American authorities  knew  about  the
    ages of all  of  the  children.  In  Islamabad  they  lived  in  rented
    accommodation. None  of  the  other  family  members  (apart  from  the
    Appellant) suffered from mental ill health.

28. In his submissions, Mr Walker said that, while he  could  not  formally
    concede the appeal, he did accept that all of the requirements of r.317
    were satisfied. As we have said, at the conclusion of the evidence,  he
    agreed that the Appellant  could  and  would  be  accommodated  by  the
    sponsors  without  recourse  to  public  funds.  He  agreed  that   the
    Appellant's sister in Kabul could not be expected  to  look  after  the
    Appellant. We should proceed on the basis that NM's  wife  and  all  of
    their children now in Pakistan would obtain visas and would go  to  the
    USA. When that happened, the only family members who would be  able  to
    look after the Appellant were those in the UK. Mr Walker accepted  that
    the Appellant on his own in Pakistan would be in the  most  exceptional
    compassionate circumstances because of his disability and his age.


29. In our view, Mr Walker's approach was sensible and humane. In a literal
    sense the Appellant is not living on his own and was not at the date of
    the Entry Clearance Officer's decision. However, he would  be  in  that
    position imminently once Z and her children left for the USA. We accept
    the evidence which was before us that there remained only the formality
    of issuing the visas. A system which allows a child in his twenties (as
    the oldest son of NM is) to join a refugee will strike someone familiar
    with the UK law as generous but we have reminded ourselves that on  the
    evidence before us the American Embassy had had the passports for  some
    time without raising what would have been an obvious  objection.  There
    is a statement from Z in the papers before the Tribunal. She says that:




           '[the Appellant] is residing with us and I am taking care of him
           and as you know that our case to USA has been completed but  our
           going to the USA has been delayed because of [the Appellant]. We
           can't leave him until you  don't  take  him.  Because  there  is
           nobody  left  to  take  care  of  him  beside  us,  neither   in
           Afghanistan nor in Pakistan and as you are aware of  his  mental
           condition so, I don't want him to wander along the roads, and  I
           am waiting for the hearing of the  petition  filed  against  the
           refused case of [the Appellant]. '


30. Humanity has impelled Z to postpone her departure for the USA,  but  Mr
    Walker, quite rightly in our view, accepts that she will go to the USA.
    Her husband from whom she has been separated for some  three  years  is
    there. The principle of family unity is an accepted adjunct of  refugee
    law and, in the UK is reflected in the attitude to family life for  the
    purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human  Rights.  It
    cannot be right that the Immigration Rules must be interpreted in  such
    a restrictive fashion that the Appellant is only eligible to  join  his
    English sponsors after Z has actually left  Pakistan  and  he,  in  her
    eloquent phrase, has started 'to wander along  the  roads.'  Mr  Walker
    does not argue that the Rules have to be so interpreted and we consider
    that he was right not to do so.


31. The appeal succeeds because the decision was not in accordance with the
    Immigration Rules. A decision on the Article 8 ground is not  therefore
    necessary for the disposal of the appeal. We are, though,  required  to
    deal with each ground of appeal. In the unusual  circumstances  of  the
    case we consider that there is family life between the sponsors and the
    Appellant. That is not usually so between brothers or between uncle and
    nephew. However, what is different here is the utter  dependency  which
    the Appellant has on his family in the UK for support. Without  a  wife
    or children of his own, that responsibility is necessarily thrust on to
    the somewhat wider family members. The denial of entry clearance  would
    constitute an interference with that family life. Since  we  have  held
    that the refusal of entry clearance  is  not  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules, it is not 'in  accordance  with  the  law'  for  the
    purposes of Article 8(2).


Conclusion


32. The appeal is allowed. It succeeds under the Immigration Rules and as a
    result of Article 8 of the ECHR.
