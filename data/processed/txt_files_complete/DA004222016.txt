                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms C Fletcher, counsel, instructed by JS Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



   1. For the reasons set out in his  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Cameron allowed Mr Wasiluk's appeal under the EEA Regulations  against
      the deportation order signed on 25th August 2016. The SSHD applied for
      and was granted permission on the grounds that it  was  arguable  that
      the judge had failed to correctly assess the level of threat posed  by
      the appellant to the fundamental interests of  society;  although  the
      OASys report assessed the appellant as a low risk of offending, he  is
      assessed as a medium risk of harm to children; the First-tier Tribunal
      judge incorrectly  focussed  on  the  low  risk  of  re-offending  and
      overlooked the assessment of harm.


            Background and relevant findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
            judge


   2. Although arrangements had been made for Mr Wasiluk to give evidence to
      the First-tier Tribunal by Skype -  he  was  in  Ireland  having  been
      refused leave to enter the UK  to  give  evidence  -  the  Skype  link
      failed. His counsel agreed that  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal judge could go ahead in his absence.


   3. Mr Wasiluk is a Polish national. The First-tier Tribunal found that he
      had entered the UK in 2009 and had remained in the UK since then until
      his deportation. The First-tier Tribunal  judge  found,  a  conclusion
      that has not been challenged by the SSHD, that  Mr  Wasiluk  had  been
      resident in the UK in accordance  with  the  2006  regulations  for  a
      continuous period of five years and therefore the relevant test to  be
      applied in the assessment of his deportation  was  whether  there  are
      serious grounds of public policy or public security which require  his
      deportation.


   4. Mr Wasiluk has a daughter (who is not a British Citizen) who was  born
      in the UK on 18 September 2009. Her mother is also a Polish  national;
      she and Mr Wasiluk do not live together;  the  child  lives  with  her
      mother, who is not his current partner, in the UK. He  has  a  genuine
      and subsisting relationship with his current partner, with whom he was
      living prior to his deportation. The First-tier Tribunal judge made no
      findings on the relationship with his  daughter,  whether  there  were
      obstacles to their family life continuing if he were not in the UK  or
      the nature of his relationship with his daughter. The  judge  made  no
      findings on whether there were obstacles to his family life  with  his
      partner continuing if he were not in the UK.


   5. On 21 March 2016 Mr Wasiluk was convicted, on a plea of guilty at  the
      plea and case management hearing, to two  counts  of  taking  a  child
      without lawful authority to remove the child from lawful  custody.  He
      was sentenced to 16 months'  imprisonment  for  each  offence  to  run
      concurrently and was required to pay a victim surcharge of ï¿½100.


   6. The sentencing judge's remarks included as follows:


                  "...The facts may be summarised as follows;  on  Christmas
                  Day of last year, members  of  the  Turkish  community  in
                  Tottenham were holding a  party  in  a  community  centre;
                  there were families and children  in  attendance.  Shortly
                  after midnight, so in the very, very early minutes really,
                  of Boxing Day, you entered that community centre uninvited
                  and in what was plainly a drunken state. You had spent the
                  earlier part of Christmas Day with  friends,  I  am  told,
                  eating and drinking.
                  You were to tell the police  in  the  interview  following
                  your arrest that you simply had no idea as to how  or  why
                  you went into that community centre at that time. You were
                  living in North London but it appears, at least, that  the
                  community centre was not on your way home, so that remains
                  a mystery as to why you were in that area at all.
                  CCTV recorded what actually happened  inside  the  centre.
                  You were seen, initially, in a brief exchange with a small
                  group of adults, and then moments later seemed to speak to
                  the   first   of   the   two   young    girls    on    the
                  indictment.....along the lines of, as she recalled,  "Come
                  and clean the toilet", and you led her, gently, it must be
                  said in fairness to you, along the corridor  for  a  short
                  distance in the direction of the  lavatories.  The  second
                  girl...is the same age, six years of age, then  came  into
                  view; you plainly said something to her, it would seem  of
                  a similar nature, but she almost immediately  turned  away
                  from you as then did Child A,  both  girls  plainly  being
                  bright  and  alert  youngsters  and  able  to   appreciate
                  something was not right.
                  One of the adults present actually spotted what was  going
                  on and approached you....he intervened,  he  told  you  to
                  leave - other adults became involved - and you did. So the
                  incident itself lasted, it seems common ground,  somewhere
                  in the region of forty seconds or so, very short.
                  .....
                  In the interview, you said you had been drinking  all  day
                  and that you  simply  had  no  recollection  of  what  had
                  happened. When you pleaded guilty you submitted a basis of
                  plea central to that basis. Central to that basis  is  the
                  assertion made on your behalf that you had no intention to
                  do anything with the two young girls.
                  ...
                  You have no criminal record of any sort in  this  country,
                  neither have  you  any  record  in  Poland;  records  have
                  confirmed that. Whilst it seems that no  record  has  been
                  provided from South Africa...I accept...that you have  not
                  been in trouble in that country either.
                  ...
                  Police  have  researched  your   background   with   great
                  care...Nothing has been found to suggest any inappropriate
                  interest in children, or for  that  matter,  inappropriate
                  interest in matters sexual. I am satisfied, therefore,  in
                  the light of all the material presented to  me  that  this
                  behaviour is totally out of character for you.
                  ...

   7. The sentencing judge concluded  that  Mr  Wasiluk  was  not  dangerous
      within the language of the Criminal Justice system.  He  endorsed  the
      Pre-Sentence Report as thoughtful and well-reasoned and that it  could
      not be concluded that there was a sexual  or  violent  motive  in  the
      encounter.


   8. The Pre-Sentence Report records, inter alia, the following:


                  ...When pressed on a possible motive for  his  actions  Mr
                  Wasiluk said he was very popular  at  children's  parties,
                  that he was often the most popular parent and got on  very
                  well   with   children.   Mr   Wasiluk   highlighted   his
                  intoxication  that   day   but   accepted   that   alcohol
                  disinhibits emotions and  thinking  rather  than  being  a
                  motivating factor. Mr Wasiluk is at a loss to explain  his
                  behaviour  but  acknowledged  the   seriousness   of   his
                  offences.
                  ....his intoxication was a feature of  his  behaviour  but
                  does not actually explain his motivation


   9. The First-tier Tribunal judge noted  the  appellant  had  no  previous
      convictions, and that Mr Wasiluk was unlikely to  cause  serious  harm
      unless there was a change in circumstances for example drug or alcohol
      misuse. The judge notes that Mr Wasiluk "was intoxicated at  the  time
      [of the offences] and that this disinhibited his thinking". The  judge
      also notes Mr Wasiluk's denial of the offences and his assertions that
      he was advised to plead guilty in order to face a lesser sentence  but
      the judge states that despite this he  is  required  to  consider  the
      offences as he pleaded to. Having considered the  evidence  the  judge
      effectively adopts the conclusion of the OASys report that Mr  Wasiluk
      is at medium risk of harm to  the  public  but  at  low  risk  of  re-
      offending.


  10. The significant difficulty with the judge's conclusion in allowing the
      appeal is that he fails to take into account the fact that Mr  Wasiluk
      had failed to engage in any programmes in relation to alcohol  misuse,
      failed to take account of the conclusions both in the OASYs report and
      the pre-sentence report that the risk of  serious  harm  increased  if
      there were alcohol misuse and that the offences had occurred during  a
      period of alcohol misuse which had disinhibited  his  thinking.  There
      was simply no evidence before the judge to indicate  that  Mr  Wasiluk
      did not continue to misuse alcohol in the manner which had led to  the
      offence or that he had addressed that misuse. It is simply  inadequate
      to draw  the  conclusion  that  because  there  had  been  no  further
      offences, then he had no propensity to offend. That is  a  failure  to
      examine and  draw  conclusions  from  the  nature  and  cause  of  the
      offences. It may be that the offences were totally out  of  character.
      But they were very serious offences, brought about by  the  inhibiting
      effect of alcohol, for which there was no evidence that such behaviour
      was no longer prevalent. This combined with his evidence at  the  time
      of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  he  had  not
      committed the offences indicate a failure by the  First-tier  Tribunal
      judge to address the task before  him;  namely  is  there  a  genuine,
      present and serious threat affecting one of the  fundamental  interest
      of society. On  the  basis  of  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal at that time it is  perverse  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      judge did not find that there  was  a  genuine,  present  and  serious
      threat: the offences had been committed  whilst  disinhibited  through
      the misuse of alcohol, there was no evidence that  he  had  undertaken
      any alcohol rehabilitation programmes, there was no evidence  that  he
      no longer abused alcohol (in particular 'binge drinking') and  he  now
      denied he had committed the offences to which he had  earlier  pleaded
      guilty.


  11. The First-tier Tribunal judge erred in law in allowing the  appeal  of
      Mr Wasiluk.

            Remaking

  12. At the hearing before me I discussed with the parties the question  of
      remaking the decision if I were to set aside the  First-tier  Tribunal
      decision. Mr Jarvis was of the opinion that  the  decision  should  be
      remitted to the First-tier Tribunal judge to enable findings  of  fact
      to be made. I expressed the view that there did not  seem  any  reason
      why I could not go on to re-make the decision based  on  the  evidence
      before me. Ms Fletcher concurred that this was possible and  that  she
      had no objection to such a course of action. Although I  indicated  at
      the hearing that that was the course of  action  I  would  pursue,  on
      reflection I have decided that this appeal should be remitted  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal for further evidence to enable facts to  be  found
      on the nature of his relationship  with  his  daughter,  obstacles  to
      family life continuing with his daughter and/or  his  current  partner
      and, of course, whether he is a genuine and present  and  sufficiently
      serious threat to society affecting one of the fundamental interest of
      society. Mr Wasiluk has never given oral evidence to the Tribunal  and
      several months have passed since his deportation.


  13. Given the nature and extent of the fact finding required  I  therefore
      remit this appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, the findings set out  in
      paragraphs  3,  4  and  5  above  retained  (unless  of   course   his
      relationship with his current partner has ceased to exist).


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision to be remade  and  remit  the  appeal  to  the
First-tier Tribunal
