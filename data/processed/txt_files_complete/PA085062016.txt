Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr S Martin, of Jain, Neil & Ruddy, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq,  born  on  12  November  1992.   He
    appeals against  a  decision  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Handley,
    promulgated on 2 February 2017, dismissing his appeal  against  refusal
    of asylum.

 2. The grounds of appeal to the UT make various challenges to the  judge's
    adverse  credibility  findings,  classified  as  applying  too  high  a
    standard of proof, inadequacy of reasoning, irrationality, and  failure
    to take account of the appellant's explanations.

 3. The judge granting permission drew attention to [25], where  the  judge
    says:

      "Asylum.  The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities."

 4. Mr Matthews sought to uphold the decision,  observing  that  is  by  an
    experienced judge thoroughly familiar with the lower standard of proof,
    correctly set  out  at  [26]  and  [27]  in  relation  to  humanitarian
    protection and article 3 of the ECHR.  He argued that  the  substantive
    reasoning did not suggest that the wrong  standard  had  in  fact  been
    applied, and that it was doubtful whether the claim in  any  event  was
    capable of falling within the Refugee Convention.

 5. I think the explanation for the misstatement of the standard  of  proof
    is a slip in preparation.  If the later resolution of the case had been
    couched in language which unambiguously mentioned the  lower  standard,
    the error would not have been material.  However, that is not the case,
    so this is an error on a fundamental point, not corrected in  the  rest
    of  the  decision,  such  that  it  cannot  stand  as  a   satisfactory
    explanation to the appellant of why his case has failed.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Handley.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
