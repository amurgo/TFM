Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms L Dickinson, Fursdon Knapper, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent (whom I shall hereafter refer to as the "claimant") is a
    citizen of Pakistan who was born on 30 April 1981.

 2. He entered the United Kingdom on 25 May 2011 as a  student  with  leave
    valid until 11 July 2012.  He was subsequently granted leave to  remain
    from 15 February 2013 until 15 February 2015 as the civil partner of  a
    British Citizen, Mr Thomas Glyn Williams.  They married on 17 May 2012.

 3. On 30 March 2015, the claimant made an application for further leave as
    a partner under Appendix FM of the Rules (HC 395 as amended).

 4. On 5 August 2015,  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  appellant's
    application on the basis that he fell within para 322(1A) of the  Rules
    having submitted a falsely obtained TOEIC certificate  from  ETS.   The
    decision states that the claimant had used a proxy test taker  for  the
    speaking part of the test and ETS has declared his test to be "invalid"
    and his result had been cancelled.

 5. The claimant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal was heard
    by Judge Holder who allowed the claimant's appeal.

 6. First, the judge noted that the Secretary of State  had  not  submitted
    the usual evidence (as he  described  it  the  "generic  evidence")  to
    support  the  Secretary  of  State's  contention  that   the   language
    certificate had been obtained by fraud.  In fact, as Mr Mills  accepted
    before me, in addition to the absence of  the  "generic  evidence"  the
    Secretary of State had not put in  evidence  the  print  out  from  the
    "Lookup Tool" demonstrating that ETS had cancelled the claimant's  test
    on the basis that it was "invalid".  In the absence of  that  evidence,
    Judge Holder concluded that the Secretary of State had  not  discharged
    the evidential burden upon her of proving  that  the  English  language
    certificate had been obtained through fraud and so para 322(1A) did not
    apply.

 7. Secondly, in any event, having heard  the  claimant  give  evidence  in
    relation to where he took the test and what happened when he arrived at
    the test premises, the judge found that the appellant  was  a  credible
    and truthful witness and so had established that he had taken the test.



 8. Thirdly, Judge Holder allowed the appeal under Appendix FM on the basis
    that, apart from the  general  refusal  ground  in  para  322(1A),  the
    Secretary  of  State  had  not  taken  any  issue  with  the  remaining
    requirements under the Rules.

 9. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the  ground  that
    the judge had erred in law by failing to adjourn the hearing  in  order
    to allow the Secretary of State to provide the  evidence  to  establish
    that the claimant's test was obtained by deception, namely the evidence
    normally presented in cases of this nature.

10. On 28 March 2017, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge E M  Simpson)  granted
    the Secretary of State permission to appeal.  In addition  to  granting
    permission on the Secretary of State's single  ground  of  appeal,  the
    judge also considered it arguable that the  judge  had  been  wrong  to
    allow the appeal under Appendix FM on  the  basis  that  no  issue  was
    raised in relation to the substantive requirements of the Rules.

11. At the hearing before me, Mr Mills, who represented  the  Secretary  of
    State, acknowledged that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  been  legally
    represented by Counsel at the hearing and no application to adjourn the
    hearing had been made to Judge Holder.  He candidly  acknowledged  that
    it was difficult, in these circumstances, to press the  case  that  the
    judge had erred in law by not adjourning the hearing in order that  the
    Secretary of State could seek  further  evidence.   Further,  Mr  Mills
    accepted that, if para 322(1A) of the Rules did not  apply,  the  judge
    had not erred in law in allowing the  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the
    claimant met the substantive  requirement  of  the  partner  rule.   He
    accepted that the Secretary of State had not put in issue  any  of  the
    substantive requirements of the Rules in the decision.

12. Having heard Mr Mills' submissions, I did not call on Ms  Dickinson  in
    response.

13. The burden of proof on the issue of  deception  or  fraud  lay  on  the
    Secretary of State (see SSHD v Shehzad and Chowdhury  [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    615).  As part of that burden, the Secretary of State had an evidential
    burden which would have been discharged by providing the screenshot  of
    the "Lookup Tool" together with the generic evidence in the form of the
    witness statements from Rebecca  Collings  and  Peter  Millington  (see
    Shehzad and Chowdhury at [30]).  In the absence of that evidence, there
    was nothing before the judge in evidence to  discharge  the  evidential
    burden upon the Secretary of State.  On the evidence before the  judge,
    he was correct, therefore, to find that the Secretary of State had  not
    established that para 322(1A) applied.

14. In my judgment, Judge Holder was entitled to determine  the  appeal  on
    the evidence before him.

15. It was incumbent upon the Secretary of State, as with any litigant,  to
    put before the Tribunal the evidence to be relied upon.  The  Secretary
    of State was represented by Counsel who could have, but did  not,  make
    an        application        for        an        adjournment        in








             order to obtain further evidence.  Such an  application  would
    not, of course, necessarily have been successful.  However,  the  point
    is  that  it  was  for  the  Secretary  of  State  through  her   legal
    representative to make any such application.  It was not for the judge,
    of his own volition, to adjourn the hearing in order that the Secretary
    of State could have the opportunity, not sought  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, to obtain further evidence. There was nothing unfair, irrational
    or otherwise unlawful in  the  judge  determining  the  appeal  on  the
    evidence presented to him, and relied upon by, the parties.

16. Consequently, I am satisfied that the judge  did  not  err  in  law  in
    reaching his finding that the respondent had failed to  establish  that
    para 322(1A) of the Rules applied to the claimant.

17. As I have already indicated, Mr Mills did not seek to pursue the  point
    raised by the First-tier Tribunal Judge when  granting  permission  and
    not made in  the  Secretary  of  State's  grounds  themselves.   In  my
    judgment, he was entirely correct to do so.  The Secretary of State had
    not raised any issue in relation to the substantive requirements  of  a
    partner rule in Appendix FM apart  from  the  suitability  requirement.
    Consequently, the judge did not err in law in finding that the claimant
    met the requirements of Appendix FM and to allow the appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

18. Accordingly, the Secretary of State's appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  is
    dismissed.

19. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to allow the claimant's appeal under
    the Immigration Rules stands.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

Judge Holder, in allowing the appeal, made a fee award in the sum  of  ï¿½140.
I see no basis to depart from that and I make the same order.
