                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss J Elliott-Kelly, Counsel


                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW

1.   The respondent has been granted permission to appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Steer allowing the appeal of  the  respondent
    on human rights grounds.

2.   For ease of reference the respondent will from now on  be  referred  to
    as the applicant.

3.   The applicant is a citizen of Albania  born  on  22  August  1992.   He
    entered the UK in 2013, without leave to  enter.   He  lived  with  his
    brother, a  British  citizen,  and  his  family.   In  June  2014,  the
    applicant met [NC], a British citizen born on  16  August  1989.   They
    began a relationship, then began to cohabit in October 2014 and married
    on 28 April 2018.  They live together with Miss [C]'s mother.

4.   The judge found that the applicant  met  the  relationship  requirement
    under EX.1(b) because by the time the application was made  in  January
    2017, the applicant had cohabited with his partner since October  2014,
    a period of over two years.

5.   In his witness statement dated 24 July 2018,  the  applicant  confirmed
    that he entered the UK, illegally, and with the  intention  to  have  a
    better life.  He had completed school in Albania  and  was  finding  it
    hard to make a decent living.  His  mother-in-law  was  suffering  from
    terminal cancer and her health was deteriorating daily.  She lived with
    the applicant and his wife in the property that  she  rented  from  the
    council.  Both the applicant and his wife provided care for the mother-
    in-law.

6.   The applicant's wife worked full-time as  a  SENT  teaching  assistant.
    Her salary was ï¿½17,000 per annum.  The  applicant  said  he  could  not
    return to Albania and apply for entry clearance  from  there,  as  they
    could not meet the financial  requirements.   The  applicant  confirmed
    that there was NHS support available to care for his mother-in-law, but
    his wife considered it to be  her  responsibility.   His  wife  had  no
    Albanian heritage and did not speak Albanian.

7.   He said his brother-in-law was living in the UK and could care for  his
    own mother.  However, his brother-in-law had his own  problems  and  no
    responsibility towards his mother and had  his  own  children  and  was
    separated from his wife who did not let him see his children and was in
    a court dispute with him.

8.   The judge at  paragraph  32  held  that  paragraph  EX.1(b)  can  apply
    because the applicant had cohabited with his partner for two  years  by
    date of application on 16 January 2017.

9.    At  paragraph  33  the  judge  cited  paragraph  EX.2  which   defines
    insurmountable obstacles.  The judge did not however make any  findings
    as to whether the  applicant  satisfies  the  insurmountable  obstacles
    test.

10.  The judge's findings are set out at paragraphs 34 and 35.   At  34  the
    judge gives reasons why she finds that the applicant has established  a
    family life between him and his mother-in-law as required by Kugathas v
    SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ 31.  At paragraph 35 the judge  finds  that  there
    are exceptional circumstances which render refusal of leave to remain a
    breach of Article 8 ECHR.  She finds that refusing leave to remain  and
    removing the applicant from the UK would result in unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for the applicant, given the  relationships  that  he  has
    developed in the UK.   Refusal  would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences for the applicant's partner.  She  would  have  to  choose
    between relocating to Albania, and so no longer living with her mother,
    as she battles her terminal medical condition, or remaining in  the  UK
    and being without her husband who is providing essential  physical  and
    emotional  support  for  his  partner  and  her  mother.   Further  the
    applicant's mother-in-law would lose the support that she has from  the
    applicant at this very difficult time in her  life.   This  could  have
    direct consequences for her physical and  mental  health  and  indirect
    consequences, given the likely impact of the applicant's removal on her
    daughter.

11.  I find that the judge erred in law for the following reasons.   I  find
    that the judge failed to give consideration to insurmountable obstacles
    which has been found by the Court of Appeal in  TZ  (Pakistan)  and  PG
    (India) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109  to  underpin  the  wider  proportionality
    exercise (paragraphs 27, 28 and 34 of TZ and  PG).   In  particular  no
    assessment was made by the judge of the factors set out in Section 117B
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.   Miss  Elliott-
    Kelly accepted that the judge did not expressly make  any  findings  in
    respect of Section 117B and the judge would have had to find  that  the
    applicant and his wife could not meet the minimum income  level.   That
    was why the judge leap frogged to  consider  exceptional  circumstances
    because of the  needs  and  impact  on  the  mother-in-law  should  the
    applicant be removed from the UK.

12.  I find that the judge erred in law  in  failing  to  make  findings  in
    respect of Section 117B.  I also find that in  considering  exceptional
    circumstances, the judge failed to factor in the fact that the  mother-
    in-law has a son who is capable of caring for her  and  the  fact  that
    there was NHS support available to care for her.

13.  In her own skeleton argument in respect  of  ground  3,  Miss  Elliott-
    Kelly submitted that the assessments of  insurmountable  obstacles  and
    whether there are exceptional circumstances  are  not  identical.   She
    went on to say that because the assessments are not identical the judge
    was obliged by the Secretary of State's own Rules and  policy  guidance
    to consider the question of whether there would be unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences not only for the applicant and his wife but also  for  the
    mother-in-law, so that there were exceptional circumstances.   However,
    it is apparent from the decision that  the  judge  failed  to  consider
    Section 117B; it was also not apparent that the judge  was  considering
    the policy guidance.

14.  Miss Elliott-Kelly said in her skeleton argument that in  reaching  the
    ultimate conclusion that  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which
    render refusal of leave to remain a breach of Article 8, the judge  did
    not rely solely or even mainly on either the fact that the  applicant's
    partner does not speak Albanian, nor that the skills she has gained  in
    the UK would not assist her in finding employment in Albania.  Had  the
    judge done so there would arguably have been an error of  law  in  line
    with the Supreme Court's application of the analysis above to the facts
    of the cases before it in Agyarko.

15.  I find that it was precisely for those reasons that the judge found  at
    paragraph 35 that paragraph GEN3.21 applies and then goes  on  to  make
    the finding that  there  are  exceptional  circumstances  which  render
    refusal of leave to remain a breach of Article 8 ECHR. Consequently,  I
    find that the judge erred in law.

16.  Although not in the grounds, I considered Mr. Tufan's  submission  that
    it is questionable whether, for the reasons given by  the  judge,  that
    the  applicant's  relationship  with  his   mother-in-law   meets   the
    definition of family life under the Kugathas test.

17.  For the above reasons, I find that the judge's decision  cannot  stand.
    I set it aside in order for it to be remade.

18.  The applicant's appeal is remitted to Hatton Cross for rehearing  by  a
    judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge S J Steer.

No anonymity direction is made.
