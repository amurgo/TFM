For the Appellant:     Mrs R Pettersen, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Bashir, of Bashir Consultancy


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer - Dhaka appeals with permission against the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Caswell) promulgated on  7th
    April 2015, in which it allowed the  Respondent's  appeal  against  the
    ECO's refusal of 11th May 2014 to grant him a certificate of  right  of
    abode in the UK.

 2. For the purposes of this decision I shall herein  after  refer  to  Abu
    Thaher as "the Appellant" and  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  as  "the
    Respondent" which reflects their respective positions before the FtT.

 3. The Appellant was born on  1st  January  1991  and  is  a  national  of
    Bangladesh. He applied for a certificate of right of abode as  the  son
    of Salim Ullah, a British citizen. The Entry Clearance Officer  refused
    the application  primarily  because  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant had provided satisfactory evidence of paternity.

 4. By the Appellant's own account his father would  have  been  almost  70
    years of age at the time of the Appellant's birth; there  was  no  real
    evidence of contact and furthermore the Appellant's father died a  year
    after  the  Appellant's  birth.  It  was  always  the  case  that   the
    Appellant's mother counted as the Appellant's father's second wife. His
    father was married to a woman called Aymona Bibi. She resided in the UK
    along with her children, one of whom is a woman by the  name  of  Begum
    Bibi (the Sponsor).

 5. The Appellant produced DNA evidence. That showed a claimed relationship
    of half-sibling kinship with Begum Bibi.

 6. When the appeal came before Judge Caswell she took into account the DNA
    evidence and oral evidence from the Sponsor.  It  was  accepted  before
    her, that the only issue was the paternity of the Appellant. She  found
    in favour of the Appellant and allowed the appeal.

 7. The grounds seeking permission claimed that the  Judge  had  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for her findings. In support of that  proposition
    it was said that the Judge had found that the DNA  test  results  leant
    substantial support to the claimed relationship (between the  Appellant
    and the Sponsor). However she failed to consider the  possibility  that
    the Appellant and her (sic) claimed father were  related,  but  not  as
    father and son. Neither does the DNA evidence address  the  possibility
    that another family member was the Appellant's father.

 8. The grounds go on in the light of the ECO's concerns over the evidence,
    including the Appellant's birth certificate and the advanced age of the
    claimed father, it is submitted that the Judge's findings that the  DNA
    evidence between claimed half-siblings adequately established that  the
    Appellant was the son of a British citizen, is inadequately reasoned.

    Permission was granted on 4th June 2015.

UT Hearing/Error of Law

 9. In coming to her decision Judge Caswell set out fully the issues before
    her. She noted pertinently  that  the  burden  of  proof  lies  on  the
    Appellant to  establish  his  claim  to  the  standard  of  balance  of
    probabilities. She also noted that the  evidence  put  forward  by  the
    Appellant is in various forms.

10. She analysed the Sponsor's oral evidence and it is  of  note  that  the
    Sponsor's evidence was tested by cross-examination. The Judge said this
    at [15] and [16],

         "First, the sponsor gave oral evidence and was cross-examined.  She
         explained the history of the family and said she had all along been
         aware of the Appellant's birth and of her father's marriage to  his
         mother. She had met the Appellant several times, most  recently  in
         the month before the hearing. She had seen him at various stages of
         his life from when he was a very small baby.

         This evidence was not directly  challenged  by  Mr  Lees,  and  the
         witness was quite clear, consistent and detailed in  her  evidence.
         She confirmed that she and the Appellant share the same father, and
         have different mothers. Given the  clear  consistent  and  detailed
         evidence of Ms Bibi, including her evidence of involvement with the
         Appellant over the years, I accept her as a credible  and  reliable
         witness."

11. The Judge then went on to  say  in  [17],  that  she  took  account  of
    evidence  from  other  sources  which  supported  the  Sponsor's   oral
    evidence. She then makes findings about the birth  certificate  of  the
    Appellant but balances that with a letter from his school a  succession
    certificate and the marriage certificate of the Appellant's  father  to
    the Appellant's mother. She addresses the issue of it being rare for  a
    man to father a child at the age of 70 but accepts that it does happen.

12. I find nothing about the circumstances of this appeal which would  call
    into question the Judge's reasoning or which might  indicate  that  she
    has misapplied the  Immigration  Rules  or  misconstrued  the  evidence
    before her such as to amount to perversity or irrationality.

13. The Judge is tasked with taking into account all  the  evidence  before
    her; analyse that evidence and arrive at findings.  That  is  precisely
    what Judge Caswell  did.  She  has  not  relied  solely  upon  the  DNA
    evidence. She ahs looked at all the surrounding evidence  and  come  to
    her findings and conclusions on that evidence. It is not her task to go
    on  a  free  ranging  consideration  of  whether  or  not  there  is  a
    possibility that the Appellant's UK half-sister maybe related to him in
    some other way.

14. Her findings on the claimed relationship are clear and are ones open to
    her especially in view of  the  mainly  unchallenged  evidence  of  the
    Appellant's half-sister.

15. For those reasons I find the determination of Judge  Caswell  discloses
    no error of law. The Entry Clearance Officer's appeal is dismissed.

Decision

16. The decision and reasons of the FtT dated 7th April 2015  allowing  Abu
    Thaher's appeal against the Entry Clearance Officer stands.

No anonymity direction is made

Fee Award

As in this case the FtT's appeal stands and Judge Caswell have  allowed  the
appeal, her I consideration of making a fee  award  shall  also  stand.  She
stated: "I have decided to make a fee award of ï¿½140,  as  the  position  and
arguments of the Respondent were  manifestly  unreasonable,  given  the  DNA
report filed and the Respondent's own guidance."
