                                     and

                              ROBERT KOSTRZEWA
                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Rea, of Rea Law, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Parties are as above, but the rest of this decision refers to  them  as
    they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD has permission to appeal against a decision by FtT Judge  P  A
    Grant-Hutchison, promulgated on 3 August 2018, allowing the appellant's
    appeal against deportation  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    2016.

 3. The grounds firstly challenge the adequacy of reasoning for the finding
    at [20] that the appellant does not present  "a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to society".  Mr  Govan  acknowledged  that
    the judge does mention 3 matters - the offending being  at  the  "lower
    end of the  scale";  a  good  work  record,  having  a  "rehabilitative
    quality"; and the appellant's stable  relationship  with  his  pregnant
    girlfriend.  He said that the judge did not explain why  any  of  these
    exclude a threat, and that they do not necessarily do so.

 4. None of those matters show that the appellant will  not  offend  again;
    but they all rationally tend to lessen any threat.   The  grounds  look
    for "reasons for reasons".  They do not show that the explanation given
    is less than legally adequate.

 5. The grounds secondly challenge the proportionality assessment, but,  as
    Mr Govan accepted, that only becomes relevant if  the  first  challenge
    were to succeed.

 6. The grounds do not rise above insistence and disagreement.  They do not
    show that the decision of the FtT involved the making of any error on a
    point of law.

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
