                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Murphy, instructed by Kanth and Co
For the Respondent:    Mr P Deller, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


   1) The respondent has produced a policy, which is intended to give effect
      to  the  principles  of  common  law  fairness  identified  in   Patel
      (relocation of sponsor licence - fairness) [2011] UKUT 00211 (IAC).


   2)  In  essence,  the  policy  provides  that,  in  cases  of   potential
      discretionary refusal under paragraph 322 of  the  immigration  rules,
      caseworkers should follow the 'Patel'  process.   Where  this  is  not
      done, the resulting decision will not be in accordance with the law.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of India and was born on 4 July 1983.

2.   The appellant was granted leave to enter the UK as a Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant on 10 November 2010 until 20 August 2012  to  study  at
    Oxbridge College. She entered the UK in November 2012.

3.   On 22 May 2012 the appellant made an application for  leave  to  remain
    in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant in order  to  study  at
    Scott's College in London.  The respondent refused the application in a
    decision of 21 December 2012.  The  reasons  for  the  refusal  by  the
    respondent are twofold. The appellant breached a condition of her leave
    (to study at Oxbridge College) because she had  studied  at  St  John's
    College.  Paragraph 245ZW and ZX of the Immigration Rules  required  an
    applicant to meet the conditions attached  to  the  previous  leave  to
    enter. In addition Scott's College was not an approved sponsor.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the respondent  and  her
    appeal was determined on the papers (at the  appellant's  request)  and
    dismissed by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Sacks  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 21 March 2013.  Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Ievins on 18 April 2013.

5.   The matter came before us on 21 May 2013 when we found that  there  was
    a material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and
    set it aside pursuant to section 12 (2) (a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007.  The  judge  was  wrong  to  have  failed  to
    address the grounds of appeal and the issue raised  by  the  appellant,
    which  was  that  the  course  she  had  studied  at  St   John's   was
    supplementary to the course of study at Oxbridge and consequently,  was
    authorised within the meaning of paragraph 245W(c)(iv)(3).  We  decided
    that  there  may  have  been  unfairness  in  the  Patel  sense  (Patel
    (revocation of sponsor licence-fairness) India [2011] UKUT 211  (IAC)).
    To assist us to re-make  the  decision,  we  made  directions  and  the
    hearing was adjourned until 2 July 2013.

The Background

6.   The background to the appeal is that the appellant  commenced  studying
    at Oxbridge after her arrival in the UK, but the college was  suspended
    from the register of Tier 4 in April 2011.  She wished to complete  her
    education and was admitted to St John's to study the same course.   The
    course at St John's commenced in April 2011 and  finished  in  December
    2011.  Oxbridge was restored to the register  in  June  2011,  but  was
    suspended again in November 2011.  Oxbridge subsequently closed and the
    students who had studied there  did  not  receive  qualifications.  The
    appellant successfully completed  the  course  at  St  John's  and  was
    awarded a qualification.  She then applied to study at Scott's,  which,
    at the date of the application, was an approved sponsor.  The appellant
    was not permitted to  start  the  course  because  of  her  outstanding
    application.  In October 2012 the appellant discovered that Scott's had
    closed.  She was unable to obtain a new CAS because  her  passport  was
    with the Home  Office.   She  wrote  to  UKBA  informing  them  of  the
    situation and she asked them to provide her with a letter to enable her
    to obtain a new CAS,  but  the  Home  Office  went  on  to  refuse  her
    application without responding to her request.

Submissions

7.   Mr Deller submitted a skeleton argument in which  it  was  acknowledged
    that the Home Office had not  followed  its  policy  designed  to  deal
    fairly with applicants whose college of choice loses a sponsor  licence
    whilst the application for leave to remain is outstanding and  to  give
    effect to the principles set out in Patel.  The policy itself, Annex  2
    paragraph 10 of the Tier 4 Guidance, is set out in the version both  at
    the time of the decision and before us at:

    http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120507005311/http://www.ukba
    .homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/pbs/Tier4migrantguidance
    2.pdf
    (version applicable at time of application)

    http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/applicationforms/pbs/Tier4
    migrantguidance.pdf  (version current at 2 July 2013)

     We attach the material part  of  the  policy  instructions  (itself  an
    appendix to the policy) as annex 1 to this determination.

8.   The policy provides for a 60 day period to enable an applicant to  find
    a new college to sponsor the application; states that  refusal  of  the
    application will follow in  the  event  that  it  falls  for  mandatory
    refusal under paragraph 321A, but goes on to  state  that,  should  the
    application fall  to  be  refused  under  paragraph  322(2)-(12),  case
    workers should follow the Patel process.  Here, if  the  applicant  had
    breached  the  terms  of  her  previous  leave,  it  was  a   case   of
    discretionary refusal  under  paragraph  322(3),  and  the  policy  was
    incorrectly applied.  On this basis it was conceded by  the  respondent
    that the decision was not in accordance with the law.

8.   It was a moot point whether the applicant had  breached  the  terms  of
    her leave by enrolling at St John's College when Oxbridge  College  had
    its sponsor licence suspended. Mr Deller submitted that rules allow for
    supplementary study which, though not defined in the rules, is  defined
    in the Tier 4 guidance which, at the date of  the  application,  stated
    (at [306]) the following:

         "Tier 4 (General) students and Tier 4 (Child) students are  allowed
         to do extra courses, for example, evening courses, as well as their
         main studies.  The course can be on any subject, and does not  have
         to relate to the  main  course  of  study.  Students  do  not  need
         permission from us to do extra studies, and do  not  need  to  tell
         their Tier 4 sponsors.  They must make sure that the  extra  course
         does not get in the way of the course that they have permission  to
         stay for."

9.   The studies at St John's College did not interfere  with  the  Oxbridge
    studies. In one sense they were supplementary to the  Oxbridge  studies
    when they were first commenced, as  the  possibility  of  returning  to
    study at Oxbridge was not excluded and indeed for a time the  applicant
    was studying at both institutions. On the other hand, it could be  said
    that at some  point  in  the  history  the  applicant  had  effectively
    substituted St Johns College for Oxbridge College  and  the  respondent
    submits that this takes the case beyond supplementary study.

Conclusions

10. We agree that the decision to refuse the applicant an extension of stay
    was not in accordance with the law, because the policy in place at  the
    time was not followed. If the policy had been  followed  the  applicant
    should have been afforded  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  find  a  new
    sponsor.

11.  Both parties agreed that a lawful  decision  remains  outstanding.   It
    was not necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether the  course  at
    St John's was supplementary to studies at Oxbridge or not.  When making
    a fresh decision, it will be a matter for the  Secretary  of  State  to
    determine whether or not paragraph 322(3) is engaged; however,  in  our
    view, the definition in the Tier 4 guidance  is  relatively  wide.   At
    some point, the appellant was studying at both Oxbridge and St  John's.
    Mr Deller indicated in  his  skeleton  argument  that  the  appellant's
    evidence contained in her witness statement of  31  May  2013  was  not
    challenged, namely that her studies at St John's did not interfere with
    her main studies at Oxbridge.  Paragraph 322 is a discretionary  ground
    of refusal and it is a fact that Oxbridge's licence  was  suspended  on
    two occasions and this was clearly not the fault of the  appellant  who
    having paid for her studies, was understandably keen to complete  them.



12.  In this case, no lawful decision  has  been  made  on  the  application
    which remains to be  determined  by  the  Secretary  of  State  or  the
    relevant officer. The appellant's leave to remain, pursuant to  section
    3C of the Immigration Act 1971, continues uninterrupted.  The appellant
    is able to vary her application and should do so within 60 days.

13.  The appellant, through Mr Murphy, expressed concern that she would  not
    be able to obtain a CAS without her passport and that this was with the
    Home  Office.   Mr  Deller  referred  to  the  internal  case   working
    instruction which  states  that  a  certified  copy  of  the  student's
    passport will be given to the appellant because colleges  will  require
    evidence of status.  We suggested  to  Mr  Murphy  that  the  appellant
    contacts the respondent forthwith to secure her passport to enable  her
    to vary her application.  We do  not  know  when  the  60  days  period
    commences and neither party was able to assist in this regard.






14.      The decision is not  in  accordance  with  the  law  and  therefore
    ceases to have effect. For this reason we remake the decision and allow
    the appeal.



Signed                                                    Date 9 July 2013

Annex 1



APPENDIX A TO RESPONDENT'S SKELETON: PATEL POLICY

|Step         |Action                                                         |
|1.           |As with all applications the caseworker will have followed the |
|             |usual procedures for risk profile, verification checks,        |
|             |standard checks, eligibility checks and identity checks and    |
|             |should be in a position to substantively consider the          |
|             |application.                                                   |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If, during the course of these checks, it transpires that the  |
|             |application will fall to be refused under 322(1A) (false       |
|             |representations, false documents or information submitted in   |
|             |relation to the application, etc) then the case should be      |
|             |refused outright on this basis. As 322(1A) is a mandatory      |
|             |ground for refusing an application, it would not be appropriate|
|             |to provide the opportunity for the applicant to vary the       |
|             |grounds of their application.                                  |
|             |                                                               |
|             |However, if the application falls to be refused under 322(2) to|
|             |322(12), then as full consideration of the application is      |
|             |required then caseworkers should proceed in the way set out    |
|             |below.                                                         |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The caseworker should first of all check whether or not the    |
|             |application was submitted prior to the expiry of the           |
|             |applicant's leave to enter or remain.                          |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the application was submitted after the expiry of the       |
|             |applicant's leave (out of time) then the caseworker should     |
|             |proceed to step 2.                                             |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the application was submitted before the expiry of the      |
|             |applicant's leave (in-time) then the caseworker should proceed |
|             |to step 3.                                                     |
|2.           |If the application was made 'out of time' then the caseworker  |
|             |can consider the application in the usual way based on all of  |
|             |the information available to them at that point. Such cases    |
|             |will normally fall to be refused under 245zx(c) and 245zx(d) on|
|             |the basis that the applicant does not possess a valid CAS and  |
|             |we were not able to assess the maintenance requirement of the  |
|             |Immigration Rules. Verification of supporting documents will be|
|             |considered and completed in the usual way.                     |
|3.           |Although the applicant does not possess a valid CAS and so     |
|             |falls to have their case refused, as their application was     |
|             |submitted 'in-time' we will delay the refusal of their         |
|             |application for a period of 60 days to allow them to obtain a  |
|             |new CAS and to submit a request to vary the grounds of their   |
|             |original application.                                          |
|             |                                                               |
|             |In such cases, the caseworker will write to the applicant using|
|             |ICD4500 and information leaflet ICD4499 explaining that their  |
|             |previous sponsor has surrendered their licence or had their    |
|             |licence revoked and that they have 60 days to either leave the |
|             |UK or to find a new sponsor, obtain a new CAS and submit all of|
|             |the required documents to show that they meet the requirements |
|             |of the Immigration Rules.                                      |
|             |                                                               |
|             |As the applicant's new sponsor will need details of the        |
|             |applicant's passport and will need to retain a copy of it for  |
|             |their records, caseworkers will take a copy of the passport and|
|             |endorse it with a 'UKBA Certified Copy' stamp. This certified  |
|             |copy will then be returned to the applicant along with the     |
|             |letter.                                                        |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant decides to obtain a new CAS and vary the      |
|             |grounds of their initial application, then they will need to   |
|             |submit fresh supporting information and documentation showing  |
|             |that they meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules in    |
|             |place on the date that the request to vary is submitted - It   |
|             |should be noted that the application date for the purpose of   |
|             |determining continuity of leave and whether the applicant is   |
|             |covered by 3C leave must be the date on which the original     |
|             |application was made.                                          |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The caseworker will need to calculate the end date of the 60   |
|             |day period as it will need to be included in the letter being  |
|             |sent to the applicant.                                         |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The letter to the applicant will also need to explain that the |
|             |applicant will be required to complete a fresh Tier 4 General  |
|             |Migrant application form as the information provided on the    |
|             |previous form is no longer valid. The letter will also ask the |
|             |applicant to return the variation request directly to the      |
|             |caseworker.                                                    |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The letter should be sent either to the applicant directly or  |
|             |to their immigration adviser/solicitor if they have one.       |
|             |Caseworkers should take care to ensure that we do not send this|
|             |letter to the previous educational sponsor.                    |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Once the letter has been completed and the documents are ready |
|             |to be despatched, the caseworker should print off a copy of the|
|             |letter for the applicant and a further file copy which will be |
|             |retained. The caseworker should enclose with the letter a green|
|             |return address label to ensure the response is directed        |
|             |appropriately.                                                 |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The envelope containing the letter and the other documents can |
|             |then be despatched to the applicant and the application can be |
|             |placed into the 'BF' hold for a period of 65 days to allow for |
|             |the submission of documents at the end of the 60 day period.   |
|             |                                                               |
|             |PEO Caseworkers Only;                                          |
|             |                                                               |
|             |At this point, you should follow the normal arrangements for   |
|             |extending cases that operate in your office - Please seek the  |
|             |advice of your Senior Case-worker if required.                 |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Go to next step.                                               |
|4.           |Once the 65 day period has elapsed, the next action will be to |
|             |ascertain whether or not any response to the enquiry has been  |
|             |submitted.                                                     |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If no response is received, the caseworker should go to step 5.|
|             |                                                               |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If a response is received, the caseworker should go to step 6. |
|5.           |As no response has been received within the specified period,  |
|             |the caseworker will consider and decide the application based  |
|             |on the information and documentation available at that time -  |
|             |this would mean that the application should normally be refused|
|             |under 245zx(c) and 245zx(d) on the basis that the applicant    |
|             |does not possess a valid CAS and we were not able to assess the|
|             |maintenance requirement of the Immigration Rules.              |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The amount of leave the applicant has left at this point will  |
|             |determine whether or not we take any action to curtail any     |
|             |remaining leave:                                               |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant's leave to enter or remain has expired whilst |
|             |the application has remained outstanding then there will be no |
|             |leave to curtail and the Tier 4 application can be refused with|
|             |a full right of appeal;                                        |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant has leave to enter or remain of less than 6   |
|             |months, then we will not curtail their leave, however, their   |
|             |outstanding application will be refused and the decision will  |
|             |not attract a right of appeal on the basis that the applicant  |
|             |still has extant leave;                                        |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant has more than 6 months leave remaining at this|
|             |point, then their remaining leave will be curtailed to 0 days. |
|             |The caseworker should follow the Tier 4 Curtailment procedure  |
|             |when completing the case.                                      |
|6.           |The letter referred to in steps 2 and 3 may elicit a number of |
|             |responses from the applicant:                                  |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The applicant may respond and say they would like to withdraw  |
|             |their application and leave the United Kingdom. If this is the |
|             |case, the caseworker should go to step 7;                      |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant still has leave remaining at this point, they |
|             |may decide to withdraw their application and submit a fresh one|
|             |under Tier 4 or any other category. If this is the case, the   |
|             |caseworker should go to step 7;                                |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The applicant may respond to request more time to obtain a new |
|             |sponsor and a CAS. If this is the case, the caseworker should  |
|             |go to step 8;                                                  |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The applicant may respond to say that they have obtained a new |
|             |CAS for a licensed Tier 4 educational sponsor and would like to|
|             |vary the grounds of their original application. If this is the |
|             |case, the caseworker should go to step 9.                      |
|             |                                                               |
|             |                                                               |
|7.           |If a request is made to withdraw an application following      |
|             |revocation of a sponsor, the process to be followed will be    |
|             |dependent on the reason for withdrawal and the applicant's     |
|             |immigration status as set out below:                           |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant states in writing that they wish to withdraw  |
|             |their application and leave the United Kingdom, then the       |
|             |caseworker should follow the usual procedures for withdrawing  |
|             |an application.                                                |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Where the applicant states they would like to withdraw their   |
|             |application in order to submit a fresh application on a        |
|             |different basis and that applicant has extant leave remaining  |
|             |at the point of withdrawal, the usual procedure for withdrawing|
|             |an application should be followed and the passport and all     |
|             |other documents can be returned to the applicant.              |
|8.           |If the applicant responds requesting more time to obtain a CAS |
|             |then:                                                          |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the initial 60-day period has not elapsed the migrant should|
|             |be notified that no additional time will be provided, and that |
|             |they have until the date specified in their original letter to |
|             |obtain a new sponsor, CAS and supporting documents;            |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the 60-day period has or will have elapsed by the date the  |
|             |response is received and considered, then the application      |
|             |should be refused as adequate opportunity was given to obtain a|
|             |new sponsor.                                                   |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Additionally, the caseworker must acknowledge the applicant's  |
|             |request for additional time in the refusal, and provide the    |
|             |reason why additional time was not allowed (i.e. that a        |
|             |reasonable amount of time had already been given).             |
|             |                                                               |
|             |The refusal will be in line with the process set out in step 5.|
|9.           |If the applicant submits a request to vary the grounds of their|
|             |application, then they should submit a new Tier 4 General      |
|             |application form, a new CAS and all relevant supporting        |
|             |documents including the documents used to obtain the offer,    |
|             |proof that they meet the English Language requirement and      |
|             |documents showing that they have access to the required level  |
|             |of maintenance.                                                |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Caseworkers should consider all of the new documents and       |
|             |information as they would when assessing any Tier 4            |
|             |application. They will need to ensure that CID is updated to   |
|             |reflect the new Tier 4 Educational Sponsor and that the Sponsor|
|             |Licence number and CAS number are input correctly.             |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Once the above has been done, the application will be assessed |
|             |and the caseworker will decide whether or not it meets the     |
|             |requirements of the immigration rules.                         |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the varied application meets the requirements of the        |
|             |immigration rules, the caseworker should go to step 10.        |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the varied application does not meet the requirements of the|
|             |immigration rules, the caseworker should go to step 11.        |
|10.          |As the varied application meets the requirements of the        |
|             |immigration rules, then the appropriate period of leave should |
|             |be granted and the case can be completed and despatched in the |
|             |usual way. Any leave remaining at this point would be          |
|             |superseded by the new Biometric Residence Permit.              |
|11.          |If the varied application does not meet the requirements of    |
|             |rules, then the caseworker should decide whether or not it     |
|             |would be appropriate to request missing information or         |
|             |documents or whether the case should be decided based on the   |
|             |information available at that time.                            |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the caseworker is in doubt, they should refer to the        |
|             |evidential flexibility instructions and if necessary, discuss  |
|             |the case with the EO caseworker on team.                       |
|             |If it is decided that the case should be decided on the basis  |
|             |of the information available at that time and that further     |
|             |enquiries are not appropriate, then the application would fall |
|             |to be refused. The refusal will be in line with the process set|
|             |out in step 5.                                                 |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If it decided that it is appropriate to make an enquiry or to  |
|             |request further information prior to deciding the application, |
|             |then the caseworker should make the enquiry in the usual way   |
|             |and BF the case for the appropriate amount of time.            |
|             |                                                               |
|             |Go to next step.                                               |
|12.          |If the applicant fails to respond to the evidential flexibility|
|             |request, then the application may be refused. The refusal will |
|             |be in line with the process set out in step 5.                 |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the applicant responds to the evidential flexibility        |
|             |request, but the information provided does not demonstrate that|
|             |the applicant meets the requirements of the immigration rules, |
|             |then the application me be refused. The refusal will be in line|
|             |with the process set out in step 5.                            |
|             |                                                               |
|             |If the response to the evidential flexibility request means    |
|             |that the applicant is now able to meet the requirements of the |
|             |immigration rules, then the application can be granted in the  |
|             |usual way. Any leave remaining at this point would be          |
|             |superseded by the new Biometric Residence Permit.              |
