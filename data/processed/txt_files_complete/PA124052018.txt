Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Hawking of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant whose date of birth 10 December 1978 and  a  national  of
    Nigeria appealed against a decision of the respondent 28  October  2018
    refusing his claim for asylum and humanitarian protection in the United
    Kingdom.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Swinnerton dismissed the  appellant's  appeal
    in a decision dated 6 December 2018. Permission to appeal was at  first
    refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge Leaver but subsequently granted by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara in a  decision  dated  1  March  2019.  The
    permission Judge found that it is arguable that the Judge  should  have
    adjourned the hearing to enable the appellant to obtain expert evidence
    to address the respondent's allegation, made for the first  time  is  a
    letter dated 28 October 2018, that the appellant's  injury  could  have
    been self-inflicted by proxy.

 3. The grounds of appeal state that the appellant should have been granted
    an adjournment by the Judge in order  to  bring  medical  legal  report
    about the injuries sustained during his claimed  torture  by  the  Boko
    Haram in Nigeria. It is asserted that the respondent did not raise  the
    point that the appellant's injuries could be  inflicted  by  self-proxy
    until in their refusal letter in 2018 and the appellant was entitled to
    an adjournment in order to obtain a medical legal  report  of  how  his
    injuries were sustained.

 4. The Judge noted that  the  appellant  claims  that  his  injuries  were
    sustained in 2011 which is some eight years ago. The Judge referred  to
    the letter of the appellant's legal representatives in 2018  when  they
    requested further time to allow the church pastor to attend the hearing
    to give evidence for the appellant. The Judge stated  that  the  letter
    referred to  the  respondent's  bundle  not  containing  the  screening
    interview, or the asylum interview stated that the appellant  had  lost
    all documents  whilst  in  detention.  Directions  were  given  at  the
    previous hearing on 19 November 2018 for the respondent to provide  the
    relevant documentation and on the  day  the  day  of  the  hearing  all
    requested documents had been provided.

 5. However at the hearing Ms Bond requested for an adjournment to obtain a
    medical legal report because the refusal letter dated 18  October  2018
    stated that the rule 35 report did not take into consideration that the
    scars on the appellant referred to in the report may be as a result  of
    self-infliction by proxy and to suggest that there are  other  possible
    causes for the scarring other than those claimed by the appellant.  The
    Judge was entitled to point out that medical legal report had not  been
    requested  even  though  the  appellant's  legal  representatives   had
    represented  him  for  the  last  18  months.  The  Judge  refused  the
    application to adjourn and proceeded to hear the case.

 6. I find that there is no material error of law in the Judge in  refusing
    the appellant's application for  an  adjournment.  The  2014  Procedure
    Rules Rule 4(3)(h) empowers the Tribunal to adjourn a hearing.  Rule  2
    sets out the overriding objectives under the Rules which  the  Tribunal
    "must seek to give effect to"  when  exercising  any  power  under  the
    Rules. It follows that they are the  issues  to  be  considered  on  an
    adjournment application as well. The overriding objective is deal  with
    cases fairly and justly.  This is defined as  including   "(a)  dealing
    with the case in ways which are proportionate to the importance of  the
    case, the complexity of the  issues,  the  anticipated  costs  and  the
    resources of the parties and of the Tribunal; (b) avoiding  unnecessary
    formality and seeking flexibility in the proceedings; (c) ensuring,  so
    far as is practicable, that the parties are able to  participate  fully
    in the proceedings; (d) using any special  expertise  of  the  Tribunal
    effectively; (e) avoiding  delay  so  far  as  compatible  with  proper
    consideration of the issues".

 7. It is clear from the reasoning that the Judge gave, that there  was  no
    unfairness to the appellant by the refusal  to  grant  a  judgement.  I
    considered the reasons for refusal letter of 2018 by the respondent and
    it is clear that the respondent did not categorically allege  that  the
    injuries were due to self-infliction  by  proxy.  The  respondent  made
    clear that there could be other  explanations  for  the  scars  on  the
    appellant other than those  claimed  by  the  appellant  including  not
    limited to self-infliction by proxy. That is absolutely  right  because
    there could be other explanations and a doctor must  consider  all  the
    possibilities. The respondent was entitled to point out that  they  may
    be  other  reasons  for  the  appellant's  injuries   including   self-
    infliction. The Judge was entitled to  find  that  there  had  been  no
    previous attempt to obtain a medical legal report about the appellant's
    injuries and one did not become necessary in 2018, before the  hearing,
    just because the respondent alluded to self-infliction by proxy as  one
    of many other reasons for injuries to be sustained.

 8. The test as to whether there would be any unfairness to  the  appellant
    if the adjournment request was not granted. I find that  there  was  no
    unfairness the appellant and he was given an opportunity to put forward
    his case.

 9. The Judge stated in respect of the rule 35 report  which  he  said  was
    obtained whilst the appellant was in detention and is  three  pages  in
    length. The report is written based on  what  the  appellant  told  the
    doctor of having been captured by Boko Haram and tortured for  23  days
    before he managed to escape. In the  section  of  the  report  entitled
    "injuries", reference is made to the injuries on the appellant and  the
    doctor said that he "raises the concern" that the appellant is a victim
    of torture.

10. The Judge stated that on  the  appellant's  narrative  to  the  doctor,
    concern would be raised by him, but the doctor was not aware  that  the
    appellant's evidence was not consistent at his  asylum  interview,  his
    screening interview and in his witness statement. The Judge stated that
    the appellant's narrative changed in the eight months after the rule 35
    report was carried out. The Judge took into account all the evidence in
    the appeal including the rule 35 report in coming to his decision.

11. The Judge pointed out the appellant had not  mentioned  at  the  asylum
    interview or at his  screening  interview  that  he  had  suffered  any
    injuries at the hands of Boko Haram or that he had  been  tortured  and
    detained by them and then  escaped.  At  his  screening  interview  the
    appellant's reasons for why he did not want to return  to  Nigeria  was
    "because Boko Haram are still looking for me. I gave  evidence  against
    them at the police station some of their members  were  arrested+  they
    have vowed to take me out they have already tried to kill me up to  3/4
    times last time in 2011 December." The Judge was entitled to find  that
    the core of the appellant's claim should have  been  mentioned  at  the
    first available opportunity at his screening interview although  it  is
    accepted that the information that is expected at a screening interview
    is limited. However, the main plank of the appellant's fear is expected
    to be articulated.

12. The Judge noted that even at his asylum interview the appellant made no
    reference to his detention and torture by the  Boko  Haram.  The  Judge
    noted that appellant had stated that his  problems  began  in  2011  in
    Nigeria and gave a very detailed explanation consisting of 7 ï¿½ pages of
    record in the asylum  interview  and  observed  that  nowhere  in  that
    detailed account did the appellant to say that he had  been  kidnapped,
    detained or tortured by the Boko Haram or  that  he  had  escaped  from
    their custody. It was further noted by the  Judge  that  the  appellant
    confirmed at his asylum interview that he had nothing else  to  add  at
    the end of his asylum interview and that his legal representatives were
    present at his asylum interview who also raised no concerns at the time
    or thereafter.

13. The Judge did not accept  the  appellant's  explanation  for  why  this
    aspect of his claim of tortured and escape  from  Boko  Haram  was  not
    mentioned in his very detailed asylum interview.  His  explanation  for
    this was that the interviewer was high-handed and that he was surprised
    to see that certain aspects of his account were  not  recorded  in  the
    asylum interview, he also  said  that  he  had  only  seen  the  asylum
    interview a week  before  the  hearing  which  had  been  completed  in
    November 2018 more than three years after.

14. The Judge was entitled not to believe this evidence and  gave  credible
    reasons for why. He said that the appellant must have had the screening
    interview and asylum interview while in detention. He said  that  legal
    representatives made no attempts to correct any part of it.  The  Judge
    was  entitled  to  find  that  the  appellant's  explanation  that  the
    interviewer  was  high-handed  was  not  credible  as  the  appellant's
    representatives from a reputable firm of solicitors were present at the
    interview and no complaints  had  been  recorded,  they  did  have  the
    opportunity to comment on the contents and to make notes of  the  minor
    and major discrepancies. This is a sustainable conclusion and there  is
    no perversity in it.

15. The Judge was entitled to find that the disparity  in  the  appellant's
    various accounts at different times seriously damages  his  credibility
    and to the credibility of this claim that he was detained, tortured and
    escaped from the Boko Haram. The grounds of appeal argue That the Judge
    has not  made  a  clear  and  sustainable  finding  about  whether  the
    appellant is a victim of torture. The Judge made a clear  finding  that
    the appellant was not a victim of torture because he  did  not  mention
    his torture and the scars that were inflicted on him  as  a  result  of
    this torture, at his screening interview or his asylum interview.

16. The Judge considered the document provided by the appellant  line  with
    the case of Tanveer Ahmed. The Judge said  that  the  email  which  the
    appellant claims was sent by his wife is  a  forwarded  email  with  no
    details as to who sent it on the date when it  was  sent,  and  he  was
    entitled to place no reliance on it. The Judge noted that the appellant
    left Nigeria seven years ago  and  found  that  in  those  seven  years
    despite claimed continuing threats and harassment, his family  did  not
    suffer any harm from members of Boko Haram. The Judge  conclusion  that
    the appellant's family is living safely in Nigeria despite the  threats
    made to his family shows that there is no fear  from  the  Boko  Haram.
    This was a finding open to the Judge on the evidence.

17. The Judge took into account that the  appellant's  immigration  history
    which was that he was arrested in 2015 and subsequently sentenced to  6
    months imprisonment for possessing false documents. He  claimed  asylum
    in April 2015 thereafter which was refused the decision dated 17 August
    2015 and certified as unfounded. The appellant made further submissions
    and made an application for judicial review and the respondent in a new
    decision dated 18 October 2018 refused his claim.

18. The Judge did not find the appellant credible and did  not  accept  his
    evidence that he would be at risk from the Boko Haram on his return  to
    Nigeria. The Judge considered all the  evidence  carefully  and,  in  a
    decision, came to conclusions open to him on the evidence before him. I
    find no material error of law in the decision and I uphold it.  I  also
    find that the differently constituted Tribunal  would  not  come  to  a
    different conclusion on the evidence in this appeal.
