For the Respondent:    Ms A. Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who resides  in  that  country
    along with her family where she has  lived  throughout  her  life.  She
    appealed a decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  UKVI  Sheffield,
    dated 30 January 2018 to refuse to grant her leave to enter the  United
    Kingdom as a spouse, which application was made on 25 July 2017 online.
    The Appellant claimed that she was validly married to  Ruball  Miah,  a
    British citizen settled in the United Kingdom. The  Respondent  refused
    the application because the genuineness  of  the  relationship  was  in
    doubt.

 2. The Appellant sought permission to appeal which was initially  refused.
    However, a renewed application was  made  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb on 02 July 2019. His reasons  for
    that grant are:-

         "1.  The First-tier Tribunal (Judge J H L Shepherd)  dismissed  the
         appellant's appeal on Art 8 grounds against a  decision  to  refuse
         her entry clearance as a spouse.

         2.   The judge found that the appellant's marriage was not "genuine
         and subsisting". It is arguable. On the basis of the grounds,  that
         the reasons for that finding are not sustainable. There appears  to
         be an underlying perception that the marriage is,  somehow,  not  a
         real one because of the sponsor's  learning  difficulties  but  the
         judge rejected the argument that he lacked capacity to contract the
         marriage. It is not immediately apparent  why  the  fact  that  the
         appellant is not informed about the sponsor's need  for  care  etc,
         even if the judge is correct on that, is relevant  to  whether  the
         relationship is "genuine and subsisting". There was  evidence  that
         the appellant had spent  time  with  the  sponsor  following  their
         marriage, when if accepted it would have been clear what his  needs
         are. That evidence stood against the judge's finding and it is  not
         readily apparent why the judge rejected it.

         3.   For these reasons, permission to appeal is granted."

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 4. Mr Balroop submitted that the nub of his appeal was the error  made  by
    the Judge in concluding that the relationship between the Appellant and
    her sponsor husband was not "genuine and subsisting".

 5. He relied on the grounds seeking permission to appeal. Albeit that  the
    Judge, at paragraph 61 of the decision, found that the sponsor did have
    the capacity to enter into his marriage with the Appellant, she went on
    to conclude that the relationship between  them  was  not  genuine  and
    subsisting and arrived at this finding for three reasons. Firstly, that
    the sponsor's reading and writing proficiencies are at a low level  and
    he has no grasp of financial  matters.  Secondly,  that  the  sponsor's
    mother did not give oral evidence during the hearing and finally,  that
    the  Appellant  is  not  appropriately  informed   about   the   caring
    responsibilities that she will have when in the United Kingdom.  As  to
    the first reason, Mr Balroop submitted that these were effectively "red
    herrings in the assessment of  whether  the  relationship  between  the
    Appellant and sponsor is genuine and subsisting". They go to the  issue
    of his capacity to conduct his relationship and  communicate  with  the
    Appellant, but no  further.  The  Judge  had  the  benefit  of  medical
    evidence which did not suggest a lack of  capacity  and  supported  the
    Appellant's presence in  the  United  Kingdom.  Further,  there  was  a
    plethora of communication evidence between the Appellant  and  sponsor,
    demonstrating that he had the capacity to conduct his relationship  and
    communicate with the Appellant. As to the issue of the sponsor's mother
    not giving oral evidence during the hearing, the  Judge  has  erred  in
    drawing an adverse inference from this. The  Judge  never  put  to  the
    sponsor that an adverse inference might be drawn as  a  consequence  of
    this. In so doing, she again  fell  into  error.  In  any  event,  such
    evidence would have added little in light of the finding by  the  Judge
    that the sponsor had the capacity to enter into his marriage  with  the
    Appellant. As to the last issue, it amounts to  an  unsafe  finding  by
    reason of it being irreconcilable with the fact that the Appellant  and
    sponsor are cousins, that they have known each  other  since  2013  and
    have been in communication ever  since,  and  that  the  Appellant  and
    sponsor lived together for 12 days in 2016 and  5  weeks  in  2017/2018
    during which time, if not earlier,  the  Appellant  would  have  become
    fully aware of the caring responsibilities she would have once  in  the
    United Kingdom. It was  during  this  period  that  the  Appellant  and
    sponsor had sexual intercourse. The Judge also erred in  coming  to  an
    adverse conclusion about the relationship between Appellant and sponsor
    on the basis that the latter did not sign her application form. Part of
    the application process would have caused her to have to  provide  both
    fingerprints and a photograph.

 6. Ms Fijiwala argued that there was no  material  error.  The  Judge  had
    considered all relevant issues within  the  appeal,  including  witness
    evidence and a failure by the sponsor to  acknowledge  the  Appellant's
    difficulties. The conclusions of the Judge were open to be made in  all
    the circumstances.

 7. I find that, for all the reasons put forward  in  the  grounds  seeking
    permission to appeal, the Judge in the First-tier  Tribunal  materially
    erred. Her reasons for finding that the relationship between  Appellant
    and sponsor was not "genuine and  subsisting"  are  unsustainable.  The
    Appellant's learning difficulties do not undermine  the  marriage.  The
    Judge rejected the argument that he lacked  capacity  to  contract  the
    marriage. There was evidence that the Appellant and sponsor spent  time
    together following the  marriage,  during  which  it  was  consummated.
    Throughout that period, it would have been  plain  precisely  what  his
    needs are.

 8. It the circumstances, the Judge materially erred.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

No anonymity direction is made.
