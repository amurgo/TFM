                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



  1 These are appeals, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Amanda Kelly), sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  7  August
    2015, to  appeals by a family who are all citizens  of  Pakistan,  and,
    apart from the youngest, born there.

 2. The judge, in accordance with established,  if  slightly  old-fashioned
    practice, referred to the appellants by their ordinal  numbers;  but  I
    think it will be clearer if I describe them by their positions  in  the
    family. The husband was born in Pakistan in 1966, and came  here  on  a
    visit visa in 2004: as it is said to have been valid till 2009,  I  can
    only suppose it was a multiple-entry one. However,  he  did  not  leave
    after six months, or at all, but was joined in 2005 by his  wife,  born
    in 1972, and their sons, SM, born 1 July 1999, and N, born  21  October
    2001. There was no further contact between them  and  the  Home  Office
    till 2010, when an application for indefinite leave to remain was first
    rejected for lack of a fee, then refused  on  its  merits,  a  decision
    maintained on reconsideration in 2011.  On  30  June  that  year  their
    daughter A was born here.

 3. A further application was made in 2012, and refused in 2013:  following
    an application for judicial review,  that  decision  was  reconsidered,
    resulting in the decisions under appeal, to refuse all  the  appellants
    leave  to  remain  on  8  August  2014.  Miss  Jegarajah  realistically
    conceded, first that the parents had no basis  of  stay  in  their  own
    right, apart from the position of the children; and second, that at A's
    age her best interests must lie in staying with her  parents,  wherever
    they went.

 4. Law and Rules   It follows that the present appeal is really about  the
    two sons. The relevant provisions are first s. 117B of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  the  only  parts  with  which  I  am
    concerned being

       (1) The maintenance of effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the
          public interest.
       (and)
       (6) In the case of a person who is not liable  to  deportation,  the
          public interest does not require the person's removal where-
        a) the person has a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship
           with a qualifying child, and
        b) it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child  to  leave  the
           United Kingdom.

 5. There is no question but that  both  sons  are  'qualifying  children',
    having been here for over seven years by the date of the decision  (see
    s. 117D); nor that, on the  judge's  findings,  their  parents  have  a
    'genuine and subsisting parental relationship with them'. So far as the
    sons' own position is concerned, the judge referred to paragraph 276ADE
    of the Rules: the relevant part being this:

       276ADE        (1). The requirements to be met  by  an  applicant  for
       leave to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that  at
       the date of application, the applicant:
            ...
            (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in
            the UK  for  at  least  7  years  (discounting  any  period  of
            imprisonment) and it would not  be  reasonable  to  expect  the
            applicant to leave the UK

 6. Authorities     It follows that the only live question before the judge
    was whether it would be reasonable to expect  either  of  the  sons  to
    leave the United Kingdom. The issue on this appeal is whether  she  was
    right to answer  that  question,  in  each  case,  by  balancing  their
    interests against what she quite reasonably described as  the  'blatant
    disregard' shown by their parents for  the  immigration  laws  of  this
    country.  Mr  Bramble  seeks  to  uphold  the  judge's  conclusion   by
    authorities such as Zoumbas [2013]  UKSC  74  and  EV  (Philippines)  &
    others [2014] EWCA Civ 874. Miss Jegarajah argues that both 276ADE (iv)
    and s. 117B (6) pose a question which has to be answered  for  each  of
    the sons on the merits of his own situation, regardless of the parents'
    cases.

 7. The judge was writing  before  the  decision  in  Treebhawon  &  others
    (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 674 was 'reported' on 10 December; but it
    may give some hindsight into the issues before her. The  relevant  part
    of the judicial head-note appears at (i):

       Section 117B (6) is a reflection of the distinction which  Parliament
       has chosen to make between persons who are, and who are  not,  liable
       to deportation. In any case where the conditions enshrined in section
       117B(6) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  are
       satisfied, the section 117B(6)  public  interest  prevails  over  the
       public interests identified in section 117B (1)-(3).

 8. That must answer Mr Bramble's reliance on s. 117B (1): only if the word
    'reasonable' in (6) and  paragraph  276ADE  (1)  (iv)  itself  includes
    consideration of the public interest in  immigration  control  can  the
    judge's reference to that be upheld. As noted in Treebhawon,  there  is
    of course a quite different rï¿½gime in force in deportation cases  under
    s. 117C, one of which was the subject of  KMO  (section  117  -  unduly
    harsh) [2015] UKUT 543 (IAC), also  relied  on  in  the  Home  Office's
    response to the grounds of appeal; but that is another matter entirely.

 9. The judge herself referred to EV   in  support  of  her  approach,  and
    summarized the effect she gave to it at paragraph 34.  EV   was  not  a
    deportation case; but it was decided before s. 117B was enacted by  the
    Immigration Act 2014 , and on facts materially different from those  in
    the present case, because the appellants in EV  had not  been  in  this
    country long enough (see paragraph 15 of the decision) to benefit  from
    paragraph 276ADE or any equivalent provision of the Rules.  It  follows
    that it cannot be treated as an authority on the meaning of 276ADE,  or
    s. 117B (6).

10. The other authority relied on by the Home Office in their  response  is
    Zoumbas , which was enacted before 276ADE appeared in the Rules at all.
    It seems from paragraph 8 of the decision that this was what  might  be
    called a 'straight-eight' case, meaning one where the only question was
    what was, or was  not  required  by  article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention. Again that does  not  help  answer  the  question  on  this
    appeal, which can only be done  by  turning  to  what  the  judge  said
    herself.

11. Decision under appeal  The judge, in an exceptionally clear  and  well-
    thought out decision, first concluded, on SM (see  paragraph  30)  that
    "All other things being equal ... it would be in his best interests  to
    remain in this country  with  his  family  ...".  That  conclusion  was
    modified by another, for which she gave detailed reasons  at  31,  that
    "... a return to Pakistan would not pose any substantial  risk  to  his
    health or well-being or bar him from pursuing his long-term ambitions."
    On that basis, she ended her consideration of his  individual  case  in
    isolation by saying at 33 "... whilst I have concluded that, on balance
    and in the absence of all other considerations, it would  be  in  [his]
    best interests to remain here, I do not find it  to  be  overwhelmingly
    so."

12. Turning to N, the judge reached a similar conclusion  at  paragraph  36
    "Again, in the absence of any other factors, I find that it would be in
    his best interests to remain in this country"; but once more, she  went
    on at 37 to say "However, as with his older brother, I am not persuaded
    that  returning  to  Pakistan  would  bring  with  it   only   negative
    consequences".

13. Dealing with both the sons at paragraph 39  the  judge  concluded  that
    "... in the absence of all other factors,  it  would  be  in  the  best
    interests of [both] to remain in this country". Finally she decided  at
    43 that it would be reasonable to require  them  to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom :

       Whilst this will inevitably cause them some distress and hardship,  I
       am not persuaded that this will be sufficiently grave to outweigh the
       wider interests of maintaining immigration control.

14. Conclusions     This was  a  case  where  the  parents'  abuse  of  the
    immigration system was gross and obvious: if the judge was entitled  to
    balance the public interests against their sons', as she did, then  she
    was very clearly also entitled to go on to decide against them  on  the
    merits. If it  were  simply  a  question  of  an  article  8  balancing
    exercise, or even of interpreting the word 'reasonable' as  it  appears
    in paragraph 276ADE, then it could not be said that she  was  wrong  to
    deal with the question before her on that proportionality basis.

15. However, Parliament has chosen to draw a clear distinction in ss.  117B
    and C, between those who are, and are not liable to deportation.  Those
    liable have to show that the effect of their  own  deportation  on  any
    qualifying child they may have would be unduly harsh; and, if they have
    been sentenced to four years' imprisonment or more,  ''very  compelling
    circumstances'' over and above that. This is  the  "more  rigorous  and
    unyielding regime" referred to at paragraph 19 of Treebhawon .

16. As the Tribunal went on to say in that  decision,  a  different  public
    interest is recognized in the case of those not liable to  deportation,
    and the effect is set out at paragraph 20: when Parliament  said  that,
    in cases covered by s. 117B (6), the public interest did  not   require
    the deportation of those with a qualifying child who it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect to leave the United Kingdom,  they  meant  exactly
    what they said.

17. It seems quite clear from the decision in Treebhawon itself,  and  from
    the juxtaposition of ss. 117B and C, that 'reasonable' in s.  117B  (6)
    means reasonable from the point of view of the qualifying child.  While
    courts and tribunals have to  balance  the  different  aspects  of  the
    child's own interests, taking into account the situation of the  family
    as a whole, as the judge did in this case, we are not  required,  in  a
    case covered by that sub-section where deportation is not in issue,  to
    balance those interests against those of society.  That  is  of  course
    something which will still have to be done in cases where there  is  no
    qualifying child; and, where any children have been here for less  than
    seven years, very much in the light  of  Parliament's  prescription  of
    that as the qualifying period for consideration  solely  on  their  own
    merits.

18. It is equally clear from the judge's decision that, considering each of
    the sons' cases from their own point of view, she would have found that
    it would not be reasonable to expect either of them,  and  particularly
    SM, to leave the United Kingdom. The result is that both their  appeals
    are allowed: while both the parents' and A's would otherwise have to be
    dismissed, they are allowed too.
