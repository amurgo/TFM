                                   Between

                                    [A S]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. On 19 September I wrote to the parties in the following terms:

         "In a Rule 24 response signed on behalf of the Secretary  of  State
         by Rhona Petterson, is the following:

             "2.   The  respondent  does   not   oppose   the   appellant's
                  application for  permission  to  appeal  and  invites  the
                  Tribunal  to  determine  the  appeal  with  a  fresh  oral
                  (continuance) hearing to consider whether the appellant is
                  in fact an atheist or not  and  how  he  would  behave  on
                  return.  It is noted that the appellant's brother  (Master
                  MMAS whose appeal was heard  at  the  same  time  as  this
                  appellant) has not sought permission to appeal."

         I have little idea what this is supposed to mean.   Permission  has
         been  granted,  as  the  respondent  is  evidently  aware,  so  any
         opposition  to  the  application  for  permission  is   irrelevant.
         Further, the notion of "a  fresh  oral  (continuance)  hearing"  is
         unknown to the Tribunal's procedure.

         On the assumption that the Secretary of State  intends  to  concede
         the appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  I  now  propose  to  allow  that
         appeal, set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  in
         appeal PA/11400/2017, and direct  a  further  hearing  before  that
         Tribunal.  Any submissions to the contrary will  be  considered  if
         received within 21 days of the date of this letter."

 2. There has been no reply.

 3. In these circumstances I set aside the determination of the  First-tier
    Tribunal for error  of  law,  and  remit  the  appellant's  appeal  for
    redetermination by the First-tier Tribunal.




                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
                                        VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
                                              IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM CHAMBER
                                                      Date: 16 October 2018.
