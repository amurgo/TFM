Representation

For the appellants:    Mr Reuben Solomon of Counsel, instructed by
Aschfords Law
For the respondent:    Ms Julie Isherwood, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission from the decision of  the  First-
    tier  Tribunal  dismissing  their  appeal  against   the   respondent's
    decisions on 30 July 2019 to refuse them leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom on human rights grounds,  within  or  outwith  the  Immigration
    Rules HC 395 (as amended).



Background

 2. The appellants are a husband and wife, who now have two  children  born
    in the United Kingdom, one aged 6 and the other, born in 2020,  who  is
    just over 6 months old.  Both appellants and both children are citizens
    of Nepal, with no other citizenship.

 3. The appellants married on  7  January  2009  in  Nepal,  both  families
    attending the wedding.  The are a  mixed  caste  couple:  the  wife  is
    Brahmin (the highest caste) and the husband  is  Cheddri  or  Kshatriya
    (the second highest caste).

 4. They both entered the United Kingdom on 21 January 2010, the  principal
    appellant (the wife) with a Tier  4  (student)  visa,  and  the  second
    appellant (the husband) with a Tier 4 dependant visa.  Both visas  were
    renewed twice, in the normal way.

 5. On 14 June 2014, the appellants had a son. In March 2015,  the  College
    where the wife had been studying notified the respondent that  she  had
    ceased attending and on 5 June 2015, a decision was made to curtail her
    leave, effective  4  August  2015.   The  wife  did  not  find  another
    educational provider in that time.  They have only  5  years  and  just
    over 7 months lawful residence in the United Kingdom.

 6. The family homes in Nepal were damaged in the 25 April 2015  earthquake
    but the appellants' evidence is that they have been rebuilt.

 7. On 1 August 2015, the wife submitted an in-time application  for  leave
    to remain outside the Rules, but it was rejected, as she had  not  paid
    the Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS).  She made  another  application
    on 22 December 2015, having paid her IHS.  That application was out  of
    time.  On 11 April 2019, it was refused, with an out of  country  right
    of appeal.

 8. The appellants, who by this time had not had extant leave for  3  years
    and 8 months, did not embark for Nepal.   On 9 May 2019, they submitted
    a second out of time application for leave  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on human rights grounds, which the  respondent  refused  on  30
    July 2019, with an in-country right of appeal.

 9. The respondent noted that the appellants had been in the United Kingdom
    for less than 10 years, and less than 6 years with leave. Their son was
    not a qualifying child and although he had  just  started  school,  was
    still of an age when the family was his  main  focus.   There  were  no
    significant  obstacles  to  their  reintegration  in  Nepal,   and   no
    exceptional circumstances for which leave to remain ought to  be  given
    outside the Rules.

10. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.



First-tier Tribunal decision

11. The First-tier Judge noted that  the  appellants  could  not  meet  the
    Immigration Rules.  They had asserted that they could bring  themselves
    within paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules, but he found that they had
    not demonstrated very significant obstacles to their  reintegration  in
    Nepal, and that their principal reason  for  wishing  to  stay  in  the
    United Kingdom related to the education they  wanted  for  their  young
    son.

12. The judge also found  that  there  were  no  exceptional  circumstances
    outside the Rules for which leave to remain  ought  to  be  given,  and
    dismissed the appeal.

13. The appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal.



Permission to appeal

14. On 11 August 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson granted  permission  as
    follows:

         "The First-tier Tribunal's decision arguably  sets  out  the  wrong
         test in [Agyarko and Ikuga, R (on the applications of) v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11] and  in  paragraph
         GEN.3.2 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules as to unjustifiably
         harsh consequences of removal, and arguably fails to make any clear
         findings on the best interests  of  the  child  (albeit  there  are
         findings with only a minor inconsistency about age and about  their
         circumstances).  It is arguable that the way that the decision  has
         been written has been to  individually  discount  elements  of  the
         appellants' claims, rather than undertake a balancing exercise with
         factors in favour of the public  interest  and  in  favour  of  the
         appellants set out clearly.

         However, materiality is clearly in issue in this appeal, given  the
         underlying claim by the appellants on the evidence that was  before
         the First-tier Tribunal and will need to be addressed by them.

         The First-tier Tribunal's decision does not  contain  any  arguable
         error of law capable of affecting the outcome  of  the  appeal  and
         permission to appeal is therefore granted."   [Emphasis added]

15. The final sentence quoted above does not seem consistent with the grant
    of permission, but it is  clear  that  permission  was  granted  and  I
    approach the appeal on that basis.



Rule 24 Reply

16. There was no Rule 24 Reply on behalf of the respondent.





Further directions

17. On 13 November 2020, the Upper Tribunal sent out triage directions made
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Kebede in the light of the  COVID-19  pandemic.





Submissions received

18. Further submissions were received from Mr  Solomon  on  behalf  of  the
    appellants. He argued that Article  8  ECHR  was  engaged  because  the
    appellants had resided continuously in the United Kingdom for more than
    10 years and had established a family life between themselves and their
    son (including his school life), a home, career, commitments, a network
    of friends and a safe secure and stable environment in which  to  live.
    They had physical and  moral  integrity  and  the  wife  was  16  weeks
    pregnant.

19. Mr Solomon argued that there would be very significant obstacles to the
    appellants reintegrating in Nepal:  they  had  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom at the ages of 24 and 26 and now were almost 35, and  36  years
    old respectively.   Their son, who was 5 years  old,  was  thriving  at
    school and had never been to Nepal.   He  was  not  emotionally  mature
    enough to cope with the change in circumstances in returning to  Nepal.
     He did not speak the Nepali language  well.  Their  families  did  not
    approve of the inter-caste marriage and the appellants  and  their  son
    would suffer social ostracism and discrimination.

20. As to Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, the respondent had delayed  for
    over  three  years  in  making  her  decision  on  the  December   2015
    application, which reduced  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  public
    interest in removing them.  Article 8(1) was  engaged,  on  the  facts.
    There were a  number  of  factual  errors  in  the  First-tier  Judge's
    decision, in particular an error in one part of his decision as to  the
    child's age, and a reference in another paragraph to the appellants  as
    'visitors' to the United Kingdom, which they had never been.

21. The error regarding the Agyarko test  and  GEN.3.2  of  the  Rules  was
    material,   given   the   elevated   test   applied    in    evaluating
    proportionality.  The test was not one  of  exceptional  circumstances,
    but whether it was reasonable for the appellants to leave.  The  appeal
    should  be  allowed,  and  remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
    remaking.

22. The respondent did not reply.

23. That is the basis on which this appeal came before the Upper Tribunal.



Upper Tribunal hearing

24. At the beginning of the hearing,  the  appellants  confirmed  that  the
    wife's pregnancy had come to a successful conclusion and they now  have
    a daughter born in July 2020, as well as their son born in  June  2014.
    Both children are Nepalese citizens.  Neither  child  is  a  qualifying
    child yet.



25. For the appellants, Mr Solomon relied on his grounds of appeal and  the
    further submissions summarised above.  The appellants had tried hard to
    regularise their status since  the  curtailment  in  2015.   They  were
    overstayers, but there were as yet no removal directions.


26. Mr Solomon reminded me that the Agyarko test had been misunderstood and
    thus  misapplied  by  the  First-tier  Judge.    As  regards  paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi), the essence of his argument was that the appellants  had
    been in the United Kingdom for over a decade, during which  time  their
    ties to Nepal had loosened.  They had not returned  there  since  2012.
    Theirs was an inter-caste  marriage:  they  were  not  relying  on  the
    Refugee Convention or Article 3 ECHR, but they  would  suffer  societal
    discrimination, ostracism and stigma short of persecution.


27. Mr Solomon relied on the respondent's August 2018 CPIN on Nepal,  which
    remained the most recent  at  9.1.3.   Although  the  judge  had  given
    himself  a  correct  self-direction  on  the  best  interests  of   the
    appellant's child, Mr Solomon continued to contend that he  had  failed
    to make adequate factual findings on this important  issue.   The  only
    evidence about the child's best interests before the  First-tier  Judge
    had been that of the appellants themselves.   Mr  Solomon  reminded  me
    that neither of the children had ever been to Nepal and that the  older
    boy was 6 now, and would be a qualified child in July 2021.


28. The family had lived in the United Kingdom for 11  years  now  and  the
    judge had  not  considered  properly  whether  there  were  exceptional
    circumstances outside the  Rules.   His  approach  to  delay  was  also
    flawed:  see Patel (historic injustice; NIAA Part 5A) India [2020] UKUT
    351 (IAC) and EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department
    [2008] UKHL 41.


29. For the respondent, Ms Isherwood reminded me that the  appellants  came
    to the United Kingdom in 2010 as a Tier 4 student  and  her  dependant.
    They could have had no expectation that  this  would  entitle  them  to
    remain when their studies were complete.  They had not had valid  leave
    since 2015 and could not meet the  Immigration  Rules  on  the  10-year
    route.


30. Although theirs was an inter-caste  marriage,  there  had  been  family
    support.  Both families had attended  the  wedding  and  there  was  no
    evidence of any family dispute: see the First-tier Judge's decision  at
    [37.3].  Their  absence  from  their  mid-20s  to  mid-30s  was  not  a
    significant obstacle to return.  There was family support and  no  real
    evidence of difficulties.


31. As regards the best interests of the child, who had been 5 years old at
    the date of hearing, the evidence was that he was a normal happy child,
    with no difficulties at school, who spoke at least some  Nepali.   They
    would return as a family unit.  Nepali was likely to  be  the  language
    spoken at home: the wife had needed a Nepalese interpreter at the First-
    tier Tribunal hearing, despite having studied here for 5 years and been
    in the United Kingdom for over 10 years.


32. The appellants' evidence was quite clear: they wanted to remain in  the
    United Kingdom for  a  better  life,  and  in  particular,  for  better
    education for their son.  EV (Philippines) & Ors v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874 had established that  there
    was no right to United Kingdom medical treatment or education for  non-
    citizens and that was not a proper reason for leave  to  remain  either
    within or outwith the Rules. Although the form of the judge's  decision
    was unusual, he had considered all  relevant  factors  and  reached  an
    holistic conclusion.


33. I reserved my decision, which I now give.



Analysis

34. The question of delay is not a material error of  law.   There  was  no
    alteration in the appellants' circumstances between 2015 and 2019  when
    the decision was rendered.  They had already had their  son,  and  they
    remained unlawfully in the United Kingdom, supported by  friends  here.
    They did not engage further with British society: they spoke Nepali  at
    home and lived within the Nepalese community.



35. There are a number of minor factual errors identified in the grounds of
    appeal.  I do not consider that anything turns on them.  In particular,
    the appellants complain that at 33.4, the judge  referred  to  them  as
    'visitors' when they have never been in the United Kingdom on  a  visit
    visa.



36. What the judge said was that the appellants' being  of  good  character
    was not an exceptional circumstance because 'It is expected that people
    visiting the United Kingdom be law abiding.  To be so is not  a  reason
    why visitors should be allowed to stay permanently'.  The judge did not
    say there that they were overstayers on a visit visa: this paragraph is
    inelegantly expressed but displays  no  fundamental  error  as  to  the
    appellants' status in the United Kingdom and certainly not an error  of
    fact at the enhanced level required to amount to an error of law.


37. The appellants also observe that in one place, the  judge  referred  to
    their son being 3� years old, whereas elsewhere, he said the child  was
    5 years 7 months, which was correct.   It is  however  clear  from  his
    findings at [37.1], [37.2], [39.3], [39.9] and [44] that  he  was  well
    aware of the child's age and school status.  Again, the enhanced  level
    for an error of fact to amount to an error of law is not reached.



38. I next consider the appellants' contention that paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)
    is applicable to them.  It is not suggested  that  any  other  part  of
    paragraph 276ADE is applicable.  The judge recorded that the appellants
    did not rely on that paragraph, but Mr Solomon says that is  an  error.
    Whether or not it is erroneous, the materiality of that  error  depends
    on whether the judge was right to conclude that there  were  not  'very
    significant obstacles' to the appellants' reintegration in Nepal,  with
    their son.


39. The First-tier Judge gave proper and adequate reasons for finding  that
    despite the parties being in an inter-caste marriage, they  had  family
    support in Nepal, both at their weddings and since, and that the houses
    in  which  their  families  live  have  been  rebuilt  since  the  2015
    earthquake.  He did not err in considering that  the  appellants  could
    not succeed within the Rules.



40. I turn therefore to Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules,  and  to  whether
    exceptional circumstances exist for which leave  to  remain  should  be
    given. It is right to  say  that  the  First-tier  Judge  misunderstood
    Agyarko in the manner set out in the grounds of appeal.  The meaning of
    'exceptional' in the respondent's instructions to  caseworkers  is  set
    out in at [19] in the opinion of Lord Reed JSC (with  whom  Lady  Hale,
    Deputy President of the Supreme Court, and Lord Kerr JSC,  Lord  Wilson
    JSC, Lord Carnwath JSC, Lord Hughes JSC and Lord Hodge JSC agreed):
         "19.                The  [Respondent's]   Instructions   state that
         although refusal of an application  will  normally  be  appropriate
         where the applicant does not meet the requirements  of  the  Rules,
         leave  can  be  granted  outside  the   Rules   where   exceptional
         circumstances apply. In that regard, the Instructions state:
           "'Exceptional' does not mean 'unusual' or 'unique'.  Whilst  all
           cases are to some extent unique, those  unique  factors  do  not
           generally render them exceptional. For example, a  case  is  not
           exceptional just because  the  criteria  set  out  in  EX.1.  of
           Appendix FM  have  been  missed  by  a  small  margin.  Instead,
           'exceptional' means circumstances in which refusal would  result
           in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual such that
           refusal of the application would not be proportionate.  That  is
           likely to be the case only very rarely." (para 3.2.7d)"

41. The judge erroneously directed himself that decisions must be  'unduly'
    harsh in order to breach Article 8 rights.  That  is  not  the  correct
    formulation of the  test.   However,  whether  unjustifiably  harsh  or
    unduly harsh is considered, that level of harshness is  not  made  out.
    These appellants who have been in the United Kingdom since  their  mid-
    20s  would  return  to  their   families   in   Nepal,   bringing   two
    grandchildren.




42. The circumstances advanced here were, again, the inter-caste  marriage;
    the age of the appellants' son and his schooling; and  effectively  the
    family's preference for living in the United  Kingdom  rather  than  in
    Nepal.   While  that  is  entirely  understandable,  there  is  nothing
    exceptional there in the Agyarko sense, and despite the legal error  at
    [15], and the First-tier Judge could have reached no other conclusion.




43. I note that in  summarising  Counsel's  skeleton  argument,  the  judge
    pointed out a number of inaccuracies: the correct position was that the
    child did speak Nepali, that Nepali was the language of  the  home  and
    his mother had been unable to give  evidence  in  English,  needing  an
    interpreter at the hearing, that the family homes had been rebuilt as 2-
    storey dwellings, and that  their  families  came  from  the  Kathmandu
    valley, the only part of Nepal where  healthcare  was  not  poor.   The
    appellants had lived within the Nepali community in the United Kingdom,
    being supported by kind friends to the tune of �1000 per month and  had
    not  really  integrated   into   British   society.   They   had   good
    qualifications and there was 88.6% employment in Nepal.   Any  concerns
    about the wife travelling while pregnant have now resolved.




44. The judge identified at [37.3] that the appellants were  both  of  high
    caste, the wife being Brahmin and the  husband  Cheddri.   I  have  had
    regard to paragraph 9.1.3 of the August 2018 CPIN, on the  question  of
    caste in Nepal:


         "9.1.3        Despite prohibition of  caste-based  segregation,  it
         persists in practice,  preventing  marginalized  castes,  including
         Dalits, from safely marrying members  of  other  castes,  and  from
         accessing places of worship, public spaces, public sources of  food
         and water, educational facilities and housing  facilities  occupied
         by members of other castes. "


45. At 9.1.5 in the same CPIN, it refers to a Civil Society Report  to  the
    UN Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial  Discrimination,
    to be reviewed at the 95th session on 23 April-11  May  2018,  entitled
    Caste-based discrimination and untouchability against Dalit  in  Nepal.
    Other source documents referred  to  in  that  paragraph  also  mention
    specifically the treatment of excluded subordinated  ethnic  and  caste
    groups (Dalits).

46. When I asked  for  clarification  as  to  which  caste  the  appellants
    belonged, Mr Solomons asked the appellants and the wife  said  she  was
    Brahmin (the highest caste) and the husband  Kshatriya  also  known  as
    Cheddri (the second highest caste).  Neither  of  them  is  Dalit,  the
    excluded group to which the CPIN refers.

47. Even had the judge applied his mind to this document, the outcome would
    have been the same: there is family support and approval, as  evidenced
    by both parties attending the wedding, and neither of the appellants is
    an untouchable.  The inter-caste argument cannot possibly succeed.

48. Part 5A of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  (as
    amended)  emphasises  at  section  117B(1)  that  the  maintenance   of
    effective immigration  controls is in  the  public  interest.   Section
    117B(4) and (5) tell us how to treat the private life of  adults  which
    has been established when they were not settled in the  United  Kingdom
    or citizens.

49. These appellants' private life developed while they were in the  United
    Kingdom either precariously, in the early  years,  when  the  wife  was
    still studying, or unlawfully, from August 2015 onwards.  Little weight
    can be given  to  that  private  life.  The  section  55  findings  are
    accompanied by a proper self-direction and all  relevant  evidence  (in
    context, only the parents' evidence)  was  considered  and  taken  into
    account.

50. Section 117B(6)(b) says that the public interest does not  require  the
    parents' removal where it would not be reasonable to expect their child
    to leave the United Kingdom.  Again, for the reasons given in the First-
    tier Judge's decision, it is entirely reasonable to expect  a  Nepalese
    child who has only just begun school in the United Kingdom to accompany
    his Nepalese parents to their country of nationality and  complete  his
    education  there.    There  are  no   features   about   this   child's
    circumstances which could possibly lead to a contrary conclusion.

51. For all of the above reasons, there is no material error of law in  the
    First-tier Judge's fact-finding or his reasoning.  These  appeals  were
    bound to fail and he did not err in dismissing them.


DECISION

52. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

    The making of the previous decision involved the making of no error  on
    a point of law


    I do not set aside the decision but order that it shall stand.
