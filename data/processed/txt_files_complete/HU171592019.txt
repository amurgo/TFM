                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although this is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO"),  for
    convenience I will refer to the parties as they  appeared  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe who was born on 12 October 1959.



 3. On 12 June 2019, the appellant made an application for entry  clearance
    to join her daughter, the sponsor, in the UK under the Adult  Dependent
    Relative ("ADR") provisions in Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (HC
    395 as amended) and Art 8 of the ECHR.

 4. On 5 September 2019, the ECO refused the  appellant's  application  for
    entry clearance and rejected her claim to enter the UK under Art  8  of
    the ECHR.

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    sent on 24 September 2020, the First-tier Tribunal (Judges Osborne and
    Trevaskis) allowed the appellant's appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR.  The
    FtT found that the appellant met the requirements of the ADR provisions
    and that the refusal to grant her entry clearance was a breach of Art 8
    based upon her family life  with  the  sponsor  and  her  other  family
    members in the UK.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The ECO sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on the  basis
    that the evidence could not properly establish that the  appellant  met
    the ADR provisions in Appendix FM and also  that  the  FtT  had  failed
    properly to apply Art 8 of the ECHR in identifying "unjustifiably harsh
    consequences" if the appellant were not admitted  to  the  UK  and  had
    failed adequately to take into account the public interest.

 7. On 9 November 2020, the First-tier Tribunal (UTJ  Martin)  granted  the
    ECO permission to appeal.

 8. The appeal was listed for a remote hearing at the Cardiff Civil Justice
    Centre on 15 April 2021 with the UT working  remotely.   The  ECO  was
    represented by Ms Petterson and the sponsor, Ms O'Connell, who  is  the
    appellant's daughter,  represented  the  appellant.   Both  joined  the
    hearing remotely by Skype.

 9. At the outset of the hearing, I explained to the  sponsor  the  process
    for determining the appeal.  The first issue was whether or not the ECO
    had established that the FtT's decision should be set aside because  of
    an error of law and, if that were the case, the second issue  would  be
    to remake the decision under Art 8.

10. In the result, having heard  submissions  from  Ms  Petterson  and  the
    sponsor, I concluded that the FtT's decision could not stand as it had
    materially erred in law in reaching its finding that the appellant  met
    the requirements of the ADR provisions in Appendix FM and  in  allowing
    the appeal under Art 8.  Having done so, I heard further brief evidence
    and submissions from Ms O'Connell and submissions from Ms Petterson  on
    behalf of the ECO.

11. At the conclusion of the hearing, I reserved my decision.  I  now  give
    my reasons on the error of law issue and in remaking the decision.

The Immigration Rules

12. The rules  concerned  with  entry  clearance  for  an  Adult  Dependent
    Relative are in Section E-ECDR of Appendix FM.   In  this  appeal,  the
    relevant rules concern 'eligibility' and are set out in E-ECDR.2.4. and
    2.5. as follows:

         "2.4.    The applicant or, if the applicant and their  partner  are
             the  sponsor's  parents  or  grandparents,   the   applicant's
             partner, must as  a  result  of  age,  illness  or  disability
             require long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks.

         2.5.     The applicant or, if the applicant and their  partner  are
             the  sponsor's  parents  or  grandparents,   the   applicant's
             partner, must be unable, even with the practical and financial
             help of the sponsor, to obtain the required level of  care  in
             the country where they are living, because -

             (a)  it is not available  and  there  is  no  person  in  that
                  country who can reasonably provide it; or

             (b)  it is not affordable."

13. Appendix FM-SE, set out in paras 34 and 35  "specified  evidence"  that
    must be  provided  in  order  to  establish  the  relevant  eligibility
    requirement of the need for "long-term personal care" as  a  result  of
    age, illness or disability.  That evidence must be independent  medical
    evidence and from a doctor or other health professional.   In  addition
    there must be independent evidence that the appellant  is  unable  even
    with the practical and financial help of  the  sponsor  in  the  UK  to
    obtain the required level of care in their own country  and  that  this
    must be from a health authority, local authority  or  doctor  or  other
    health professional.

14. These provisions, which were brought into effect in Appendix FM from  9
    July 2012, were considered by the Court of Appeal  in  R  (BritCits)  v
    SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 368.  In that case, the Court of Appeal rejected a
    judicial review challenge to the ADR Rules.  The Master  of  the  Rolls
    (Sir Terence Etherton MR) described the underlying policy  of  the  ADR
    rules as follows (at [58]):

         "... the policy intended to be implemented by the new ADR Rules, as
         appears from the evidence, the new ADR  Rules  themselves  and  the
         Guidance, and confirmed in the oral submissions of Mr Neil Sheldon,
         counsel for the SoS, is clear enough. It is  twofold:  firstly,  to
         reduce the burden on the taxpayer for the provision of  health  and
         social care services to those ADRs whose needs can  reasonably  and
         adequately be met in their home country; and, secondly,  to  ensure
         that those ADRs whose needs can only be reasonably  and  adequately
         met in the UK are granted fully settled status and full  access  to
         the NHS and social care provided by local authorities.  The  latter
         is intended to avoid disparity  between  ADRs  depending  on  their
         wealth and to avoid precariousness of status occasioned by  changes
         in the financial circumstances of ADRs once settled here."

15. At [59], the court also set out the scope of the rule and its focus  on
    whether a reasonable level of care provided to the "required level"  in
    the individual's home  country  as  the  yardstick  of  the  provision.
    Further, the importance of accessibility and ability to obtain the care
    (albeit through financial support from UK based relatives) is a feature
    of the rule.  The rule is also, the Court of Appeal noted, "capable  of
    embracing emotional and psychological requirements".  The Master of the
    Rolls said this:

         "...as is apparent from the Rules and the Guidance, the focus is on
         whether the care required by the ADR applicant can be  "reasonably"
         provided and to "the required level" in their home country.  As  Mr
         Sheldon confirmed in his oral submissions, the provision of care in
         the home country must be reasonable both from  the  perspective  of
         the provider and the perspective of the applicant, and the standard
         of  such  care  must  be  what  is  required  for  that  particular
         applicant. It is possible that insufficient attention has been paid
         in the past to these considerations, which focus on  what  care  is
         both necessary and reasonable for the applicant to receive in their
         home  country.  Those  considerations  include  issues  as  to  the
         accessibility and geographical location of the  provision  of  care
         and the standard of care. They are capable of  embracing  emotional
         and psychological requirements verified by expert medical evidence.
         What is reasonable is, of course, to be objectively assessed."

16. Subsequently, in Ribeli v Entry Clearance Officer, Pretoria [2018] EWCA
    Civ 611, the Court of Appeal approved the comment made  by  the  UT  in
    that case that the ADR provisions are  "rigorous  and  demanding"  (see
    [43] and [56] per Singh LJ).

The FtT's Decision

17. The FtT heard oral evidence from the  sponsor  (the  appellant's  elder
    daughter), her younger  daughter  (Thelma  Foxen)  and  her  son  (Glen
    Roberts).  In addition, the FtT had a letter from Dr  Mutseyekwa  dated
    19 March 2020.  The FtT set out that evidence  at  paras  8-18  of  its
    decision as follows:

         "The Hearing

         The Sponsor

         8.   The Sponsor gave evidence  in  English.   She  said  that  her
             father died in 2017 and her mother had been living alone since
             then.  She suffers from diabetes and she  has  undergone  knee
             surgery  for  an  injury  sustained  when  she   was   playing
             basketball when young.  She does not drive and  is  unable  to
             walk far and so she needs help to collect her medication.  She
             is able to dress, wash, use the toilet and cook  without  help
             but she is unable to clean the house.

         9.   It is very expensive to fly to Zimbabwe to visit her  and  the
             cost of care in that country is also very high.  Her  children
             in the United Kingdom can care for her here more cheaply.  The
             appellant has been a regular visitor  to  the  United  Kingdom
             since 2008, on each occasion returning in accordance with  her
             visa.

         10.  She was cross-examined.  The doctor's letter does not  provide
             an assessment of the appellant's care needs.  Her knee surgery
             was approximately five years ago and she uses crutches and has
             a brace on her knee.

         11.  The Sponsor last visited Zimbabwe in July 2019 and spent a few
             weeks there.  Her siblings last visited in 2017 on  the  death
             of their father.  They sent money to her to pay for a cleaner.
              She needs to collect medication twice a month but it  is  not
             always available in Zimbabwe and she has to pay a runner to go
             to South Africa to  collect  her  medication  there  and  also
             sometimes to obtain food.

         12.  She has lived in the family home for 40 years which is located
             in a suburb.  She has little contact with her neighbours  whom
             the  Sponsor  described  as  drunkards.   Her  children   send
             approximately �1,500 each month and the Sponsor sent �500 last
             night.  Her children will undertake to pay all  her  costs  of
             medical treatment and some assistance in the United Kingdom.

         Thelma Foxen

         13.  She is the Sponsor's sister and the appellant's daughter.  She
             and her daughter live with the Sponsor and their  brother  and
             his family live nearby.  The death of their father in 2017 had
             a big impact on all of them.  Until that  time  the  appellant
             had never been  alone.   While  caring  for  her  husband  the
             appellant's own health declined and she developed eye problems
             which made it difficult for her to read  the  instructions  on
             her medication and sometimes she took too much.  The appellant
             is retired from work and  will  be  unable  to  find  work  in
             Zimbabwe, even if she were able to do so.

         14.  She was cross-examined.  Her mother had worked for Coopers and
             Lybrand but her employment was not pensionable.   She  stopped
             work in 1996 because her husband was the main provider.

         15.  The appellant uses crutches most of the  time  in  winter  and
             about six or seven times a month in the  summer.   Thelma  has
             worked in the care industry and has sent her mother  aids  for
             living such as a hire chair.  Her mother lives in  a  crescent
             of seven houses and an unsafe area with a barn nearby, she has
             no contact with her neighbours.   Her  mother  is  lonely  and
             misses her children and grandchildren and  has  no  family  in
             Zimbabwe to help her.

         Glen Elton Roberts

         16.  He is the appellant's son and the brother of the  Sponsor  and
             Thelma.  They are a very close  family  and  want  to  provide
             their mother with the best help possible.  He  has  worked  in
             the care industry and said that his mother can do most  things
             by herself such as walking  or  getting  dressed.   She  needs
             adaptions such as a toilet frame, lower shower and  handrails.



         17.  He was cross-examined.  He said that he spoke  to  his  mother
             yesterday and she said that her  body  was  not  what  it  was
             before.  Her last visit here was in  2018.   Last  month  they
             sent �1,900 to her by Western Union  and  over  the  last  six
             months a total of �7,000.  They  had  been  sending  at  least
             �1,000 a month since 2008.  He has his own family  to  support
             and rent to pay and this makes the remittances difficult.

         Other Evidence

         Letter From Dr. M. B. Mutseyekwa Dated 19 March 2020

         18.  The letter  states  that  the  appellant  had  been  receiving
             treatment  for   diabetes   since   2015   and   has   chronic
             osteoarthritis of the right knee.  She  takes  Metformin  1  g
             daily  for  the  diabetes  and  it  has  become   increasingly
             difficult to obtain  this  due  to  erratic  availability  and
             escalating costs.  She underwent Arthroscopy for the knee  but
             continues to experience pain which makes it difficult for  her
             to stand for long  periods  and  she  needs  to  take  regular
             painkiller  medication.   Physiotherapy  is   expensive.    In
             addition, she has been coping with loneliness  and  depression
             since the death of her husband from  cancer  in  2017.   Being
             with her children would be of benefit to  her  physically  and
             emotionally."

18. Before the FtT, the ECO's submissions were that the  evidence  did  not
    show that the appellant required "long-term personal  care  to  perform
    everyday tasks".  The appellant's submissions,  made  by  the  sponsor,
    were that the appellant's circumstances in Zimbabwe were getting  worse
    and that since the death of their father they had to send more money to
    the appellant.  The appellant was lonely and telephones  them  four  or
    five times a day.  It would be easier for them to care for her  in  the
    UK.

19. The FtT set out its reasons for concluding that the requirements of the
    ADR rule were met in para 31 of its determination as follows:

         "31.     The primary ground for refusal of the application was that
             the respondent did not accept that the appellant  was  related
             to the sponsor as claimed.  That issue has  been  resolved  to
             the satisfaction of the respondent by documentary evidence and
             is no longer relied upon in these proceedings.  Therefore, the
             only remaining ground of refusal is [...] that the  respondent
             is  not  satisfied  that  the  appellant  requires   long-term
             personal care to  perform  everyday  tasks  due  to  her  age,
             illness or disability.  The refusal decision cites the lack of
             medical documents to  confirm  these  matters.   The  doctor's
             letter relied upon by the appellant is regrettably lacking  in
             sufficient detail about these matters, but we have heard  oral
             evidence   from   the   appellant's   children   about   these
             requirements and we have no reason  to  disbelieve  what  they
             told us.  We are satisfied to the required standard  that  due
             to her age, illness or disability, the appellant required long-
             term personal care to perform everyday tasks such as  washing,
             dressing, cooking and cleaning.  She also requires  such  help
             with shopping and obtaining  essential  medication,  sometimes
             having to pay someone to go out of the country to obtain  it."



The Error of Law Issue

20. In the grounds of appeal, the ECO does not  directly  take  issue  with
    whether the evidence strictly complied with  the  "specified  evidence"
    provisions in Appendix FM-SE - which it does not appear  to  do  except
    for the doctor's letter.  Instead, the contention is that the  evidence
    from the sponsor and the appellant's  other  children  in  the  UK  was
    incapable of establishing that her long-term personal care  needs  were
    not being met either because she was able to perform the tasks  herself
    or was able to do so by paying  for  assistance  and  help  with  money
    provided by her children living in the UK.

21. The grounds were adopted by Ms Petterson in her submissions  on  behalf
    of the ECO.

22. The sponsor, on behalf of the appellant, told me that they had said all
    they could on behalf of the appellant and that anything more would only
    be embellishing it, by which she meant repetitious.  She said that they
    were not able to obtain  any  more  medical  evidence  but  doctors  in
    Zimbabwe were reluctant to say everything  about  the  availability  of
    medical care in order to protect themselves.  She said that the  family
    would like the opportunity for the appellant to be with them in the UK.
     She had previously had their father  to  support  her  but  since  his
    passing in 2017 the appellant had been  on  her  own  and  the  sponsor
    reminded me that the family in the UK spoke to her by videocall  around
    five times a day.

23. In my judgment, the  evidence  before  the  FtT  could  not  reasonably
    support the FtT's finding in para 31  of  its  determination  that  the
    appellant met the requirements in E-ECDR.2.4 and 2.5.  The evidence was
    that the appellant was, for example,  able  to  dress,  wash,  use  the
    toilet and cook without help.  She was unable to clean her  house  but,
    with the financial support of her family in  the  UK,  she  employed  a
    cleaner.  Likewise, she required help to  collect  her  medication  but
    that was available and, again  with  the  financial  support  from  her
    family in the UK, she employed a person to collect it,  including  from
    South Africa.

24. Whilst I do not doubt the genuineness and sincerity of  the  underlying
    reasons of the appellant's family for wanting the appellant to live  in
    the UK, namely that the appellant would be better off living in the  UK
    with them, the ADR provisions lay down, as the Court of Appeal noted in
    Ribeli,  requirements  that  are  "rigorous  and   demanding".    Those
    requirements require  the  appellant  to  establish  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities that her "long-term personal  care"  needs  in  order  to
    perform everyday tasks are not met in Zimbabwe and cannot  be  provided
    to the "required level of care" because they are either  not  available
    or are not affordable.  The evidence from the witnesses in this  appeal
    do not establish those requirements.   The  appellant's  personal  care
    needs are either met by the appellant herself or are available and  are
    provided by others with funds provided by her family in  the  UK.   Her
    medical needs are met and the FtT could only decide the appeal  on  the
    basis of the actual evidence provided.

25. Whilst there is, no doubt, a psychological and  emotional  impact  upon
    the appellant living in Zimbabwe with her family in the UK.  The impact
    of separation is mitigated to some extent by the fact that  she  speaks
    to her family four or five times on the telephone (and that is  now  by
    videocall).  She has also visited regularly since 2008 the  UK  to  see
    her family, including her grandchildren. Her family have visited her in
    Zimbabwe too.

26. Taking all this evidence together,  the  appellant  could  not,  in  my
    judgment, reasonably establish on a balance of probabilities  that  the
    requirements of E-ECDR.2.4. and 2.5. were met.  The FtT's  decision  to
    the contrary was unsustainable on the evidence.

27. For these reasons, therefore, the FtT erred  in  law  in  reaching  its
    finding that the appellant met the requirements of the  ADR  provisions
    in Appendix FM.

28. Of course, the appeal to the FtT was limited to Art 8 of the ECHR.  The
    Tribunal set out  the  relevant  five-stage  test  in  Razgar  and  its
    application at paras 34-42.  However, in reaching its  conclusion  that
    the  decision  to  refuse  the  appellant   entry   clearance   was   a
    disproportionate interference with her family life, the FtT relied upon
    the fact that the appellant met the  requirements  of  the  Rules  (see
    paras  38  and  40-41).   At  para  38,  the  FtT  concluded  that  the
    interference with her family life was "unnecessary in the interests  of
    the economic well-being of the country" because "the appellant can meet
    the Rules".  Then, at para 41 in considering the  public  interest  the
    Tribunal again stated: "the appellant can satisfy the Immigration Rules
    for family life".  The decision in respect of Art 8 was, as  a  result,
    material affected by the finding (not properly open to  the  FtT)  that
    the appellant met the requirements of the ADR rules.  The  decision  to
    allow the appellant's appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR cannot, therefore,
    be sustained and is set aside.

Remaking the Decision

29. Having indicated that the FtT's decision could not  stand  and  that  I
    would remake the decision, the sponsor provided  some  additional  oral
    evidence in answer to questions from me and in brief  cross-examination
    by Ms Petterson.  None of the evidence went any further than that which
    was before the FtT in any large measure.

30. The appellant's husband had  passed  away  in  November  2017  and  the
    appellant had no family in Zimbabwe.  She had a sister in Derby and her
    other siblings were in Australia.  Her children all lived  in  the  UK.
    She spoke with her family in the UK  at  least  five  times  a  day  by
    videocall.  The appellant has four grandchildren - her younger daughter
    has one child and her son has three children who are  aged  between  1�
    years and 10 years old.  They interact with her through the videocalls.
     The three older grandchildren met her  at  her  husband's  funeral  in
    November 2017 and, of course, the appellant  has  made  regular  visits
    since 2008 to the UK to visit her family since her husband  died.   She
    has returned to Zimbabwe after each visit.

31. In answer to questions from Ms Petterson, the sponsor said that it  was
    costly for the appellant to visit the UK.  The family  were  trying  to
    eliminate the appellant living on her own  for  long  periods  of  time
    which affected her emotionally.  They wish to give her  a  more  stable
    family life in the UK as she had done for them.  The sponsor said  that
    doctors generally do not want to write down anything that  could  "come
    back on them".

    The Submissions

32. On behalf of the ECO, Ms Petterson submitted that the  appellant  could
    not succeed under the ADR rules or under Art 8 outside the Rules.   She
    accepted that there was evidence of loneliness and interaction with her
    family, including her grandchildren in the UK.  However, she  submitted
    that there were not "unjustifiably harsh  consequences"  sufficient  to
    outweigh the public interest and establish a  breach  of  Art  8.   The
    appellant's care and personal needs were being met.  She  could  always
    come to the UK as a visitor.

33. On behalf of the appellant, the sponsor submitted that Art  8  was  all
    about 'family life' and that is what they  would  like  to  further  by
    bringing the appellant to the UK.  It was what, the sponsor  said,  any
    child would want to do for a parent  to  the  best  of  their  ability,
    namely further their family life and not leave their joining the family
    in the UK until the appellant was unable to  do  anything  for  herself
    because she was incapacitated.  The family, she said, should be able to
    enjoy themselves together now when she can play with her grandchildren.



    Discussion and Findings

34. The appellant's claim under Art  8  must  be  established  outside  the
    Rules.  For the reasons I have  already  given,  the  appellant  cannot
    establish,  on  a  balance  of  probabilities,  that  she   meets   the
    requirements of the ADR rule in E-ECDR.2.4. and 2.5.

35. Article 8 of the ECHR provides as follows:

         "Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life


         1. Everyone has the right to respect for  his  private  and  family
         life, his home and his correspondence.


         2. There shall be no interference by a public  authority  with  the
         exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law
         and is necessary in  a  democratic  society  in  the  interests  of
         national security, public safety or the economic well-being of  the
         country,  for  the  prevention  of  disorder  or  crime,  for   the
         protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights
         and freedoms of others."


36. In determining the claim under Art 8, I apply the five-stage test in  R
    (Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  Although this is a case  of  'positive
    obligations' under Art 8 as it involves entry into the UK,  the  Razgar
    approach (a negative obligation case) remains helpful and  a  different
    mode of analysis is unlikely to be substantially important (see  Hesham
    Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 at [32]).  In R (Agyarko and another) v  SSHD
    [2017] UKSC 11 at [41) Lord Reed said:

         "Ultimately, whether the case is considered to concern  a  positive
         or a negative obligation, the question for the  European  court  is
         whether a fair balance has been struck. As was explained in Hesham
         Ali at paras 47-49, that question is determined under our domestic
         law by applying the structured approach  to  proportionality  which
         has been followed since Huang."


37. In R (Razgar) at [17], Lord Bingham set out the 5-stage  approach  when
    applying Art 8:

         "In considering whether a challenge to  the  Secretary  of  State's
         decision to remove a person must clearly fail, the reviewing  court
         must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal would be likely  to
         fare  before  an  adjudicator,  as  the  tribunal  responsible  for
         deciding the appeal if there were an appeal. This  means  that  the
         reviewing court must ask itself  essentially  the  questions  which
         would have to be answered  by  an  adjudicator.  In  a  case  where
         removal is resisted in reliance on article 8, these  questions  are
         likely to be:


              (1)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by a public
              authority with the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
              respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?


              (2)  If so, will such interference have consequences of such
              gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?


              (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


              (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in  a  democratic
              society in the interests of national security, public  safety
              or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention
              of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,
              or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


              (5)  If  so,  is  such  interference  proportionate  to  the
              legitimate public end sought to be achieved?"


38. In addition to the Art 8 right of an appellant, the  Art  8  rights  of
    others with whom they share family life are also relevant (see,  Beoku-
    Betts v SSHD [2018] UKHL 39). In  carrying  out  the  'fair  balancing'
    exercise required by Art 8.2, the best interests of  any  child  are  a
    primary, though not paramount, consideration (see ZH(Tanzania)  v  SSHD
    [2010] UKSC 4 and Zoumbas v SSHD [2013] UKSC 74 at [10]).

39. I accept that the appellant,  based  upon  her  relationship  with  her
    children and grandchildren in the UK,  has  established  'family  life'
    with them.  I also accept that that family life will be interfered with
    if the appellant is not granted entry clearance.

40. That interference will be  in  accordance  with  the  law,  namely  the
    Immigration Rules.

41. The crucial issue in this appeal is whether or not that interference is
    a "proportionate" interference based upon a legitimate aim, namely  the
    economic well-being of the  country,  including  effective  immigration
    control.   That  requires  a  'fair  balance'  to  be  struck   between
    individual interests and the public  interest.   In  striking  a  'fair
    balance' between the competing public and  individual  interests,  when
    determining proportionality, in Agyarko, Lord Reed recognised  at  [47]
    the courts have:

         "to take the Secretary of State's policy into account and to attach
         considerable  weight  to  it  at  a  general  level,  as  well   as
         considering all the factors which are relevant  to  the  particular
         case."

42. In determining the issue of proportionality, a court of  tribunal  must
    have regard to the factors  set  out  in  s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended) (see s.117A(2)).  Sections
    117B(1)-(3) are relevant in this appeal.

43. In order  to  succeed  in  a  claim  outside  the  Rules,  it  must  be
    established that the public interest is outweighed  by  the  individual
    circumstances of the appellant and her family such that there would  be
    "unjustifiably harsh consequences" if she is  refused  entry  clearance
    (see Agyarko at [48] and [60] per Lord Reed).

44. In this appeal, as I have already noted, the appellant cannot meet  the
    requirements of the  ADR  provisions  in  the  Rules  that  the  policy
    underlying those Rules  was  noted  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  the
    BritCits' case at [58] set out above.   In  particular,  the  Court  of
    Appeal noted that one of the  policies  underlying  the  Rules  was  to
    "reduce the burden on the taxpayer for  the  provision  of  health  and
    Social Services' care to ADRs whose needs can reasonably and adequately
    be met in their own country".

45. As I observed earlier, the underlying  motivation  of  the  appellant's
    family (and the appellant herself) to come to the UK in order for  them
    to live as a family and support  the  appellant  is  entirely  genuine,
    sincere and, indeed, understandable.  The Rules do not, however, permit
    the appellant to enter the UK in her  particular  circumstances.   That
    reflects an important, and strong, policy  which  must  be  taken  into
    account under Art 8.2.

46.  Further,  I  carry  forward  my  conclusions  on  the  evidence  above
    concerning the appellant's circumstances in Zimbabwe.  The  basis  upon
    which the appellant cannot meet the requirements of  the  ADR  rule  is
    that her long-term personal care needs (physical and medical)  are  met
    in Zimbabwe either because she is able to take care of her own needs or
    her needs are catered for through the support of others paid for by her
    family in the UK.  That financial support from the  UK  which,  on  the
    figures given in evidence before the FtT, is  quite  substantial,  will
    continue and the contrary was not suggested before me by the sponsor.

47. The appellant is, at least to some extent, able to  interact  with  her
    family, including her grandchildren via her videocalls which, I accept,
    take place at least five times a day.  That is no  complete  substitute
    for face-to-face interaction  but  it  is  also  not  an  insignificant
    interaction between separated family members.  It would, no  doubt,  be
    better for her grandchildren - in  their  'best  interests'  -  if  the
    appellant were in the UK rather than Zimbabwe.

48. In addition, the appellant has made regular visits to the UK since 2008
    to visit her family.  On each occasion,  she  has  remained,  and  then
    returned to Zimbabwe following her  six-month  maximum  visit  on  each
    occasion.  I accept that this financially costs her family  in  the  UK
    but they have been able to afford it  in  the  past  and  there  is  no
    evidence before me to suggest that they  could  not  continue  to  fund
    these visits in the future.  There is, I should  say,  nothing  in  the
    evidence before me to suggest that any future applications  for  visits
    would be other than genuine  and,  consistently  with  the  appellant's
    immigration history, would not result in her returning to  Zimbabwe  at
    the end of the visit.

49. There is a clear public interest engaged in this appeal given that  the
    appellant cannot meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  (see
    s.117B(1) of the NIA Act 2002).  The FtT accepted  that  the  appellant
    speaks English and would be financially self-sufficient in the UK as  a
    result of support from her children and  that,  therefore,  the  public
    interest in ss.117B(2) and (3) of the NIA  Act  2002  is  not  engaged.
    However, that is a neutral factor and does not detract from the  public
    interest in the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration  control  (see
    Rhuppiah v SSHD [2018] UKSC 58 at [57] per Lord Wilson).

50.  I  accept  that  her  circumstances  in  Zimbabwe  may  present   some
    difficulties for  her.   Her  personal  care  and  medical  needs  are,
    however, met.  Despite the evidence of the appellant's  loneliness  and
    absence of  any  family  in  Zimbabwe,  given  all  the  circumstances,
    including that her long-term personal care needs are  met  in  Zimbabwe
    and that she can maintain contact with  her  family  while  she  is  in
    Zimbabwe via videocalls and can continue to visit the UK on  a  regular
    basis as a visitor, I am  not  satisfied  that  the  refusal  of  entry
    clearance in order to settle in the  UK  with  her  family  results  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences so as to outweigh the public interest.



51. For these reasons, therefore, I am not satisfied that the  decision  to
    refuse the appellant entry clearance breaches Art 8 of the ECHR.

Decision

52. For the above reasons, the decision of the First-tier Tribunal to allow
    the appellant's appeal under Art 8 of the ECHR  involved  an  error  of
    law.  That decision cannot stand and is set aside.

53. I substitute a decision dismissing the appellant's appeal under  Art  8
    of the ECHR.
