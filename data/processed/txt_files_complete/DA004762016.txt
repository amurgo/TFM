Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C. Mupara, Counsel, instructed by Chipatiso
Associates LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant was born on 11 January 1968.  He is a citizen of Nigeria.
     He appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the  decision  made  by
    the respondent to take action to remove him.  The decision was made  on
    the basis of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006
    (2006 No 1003).  For reasons which  I  will  explain  later  the  judge
    sought to justify it because  there  were  serious  grounds  of  public
    policy or public security which entitled the appellant to be removed.

 2. The appellant claims to have entered the United Kingdom in 1999 but  he
    married his Dutch wife, Ms Princess Akonedo, on 28 February 2002.  As a
    result of  his  marriage  he  later  became  entitled  to  a  permanent
    residence card which he eventually  obtained  on  8  March  2012.   The
    permanent residence card expires in March of 2022.

 3. The circumstances in which the Secretary of State came to the view that
    the residence card should be  curtailed  was  that  the  appellant  had
    committed a criminal offence.  On 4 June 2015 at Chelmsford Crown Court
    the appellant was convicted of assisting unlawful immigration  into  an
    EU member state and was  sentenced  to  2�  years'  imprisonment.   The
    manner in which the offence was committed was referred to by the  judge
    in paragraphs 16 and 17 of the determination.  In essence  it  is  said
    that one Faith Sunday produced a genuine Austrian  identification  card
    in the name of Sarah Akonedo, the  appellant's  sister-in-law,  who  is
    married to the appellant's brother.  She was refused entry on the basis
    that the card did not belong to her.  As a result of this the appellant
    was jointly charged with Ruth Ehioghiren, who is the  sister  of  Sarah
    Akonedo, of facilitating Ms Sunday's entry into Slovakia.  The aid that
    the appellant gave was assistance, if not actually making, the  booking
    with Ryanair for the flight and secondly delivering both ladies in  his
    car to Stansted Airport.  Ms Ehioghiren  then  proceeded  on  the  same
    flight as Ms Sunday to Bratislava.

 4. It has been a constant feature of the submissions made before  me  this
    morning that this was an  offence  which  consisted  of  no  more  than
    booking a ticket for the airline and then acting as a taxi  service  to
    the two ladies in the course of this act of dishonesty.  That  was  not
    the view that was taken by the judge in his sentencing  remarks,  which
    are found at B2 and B3 in the bundle.  What the judge said is:

         "It is quite clear to me, and from having heard the evidence at the
         trial, that your involvement in this case was key and not  marginal
         in the way that you have suggested to probation.   Indeed,  in  the
         probation report, it is quite clear that you, rather than accepting
         responsibility for this criminal offence, seem to  regard  yourself
         as a victim of the offence and  you  have  asserted  to  probation,
         really, that it is all down to your brother  and  facts  which  you
         asserted at trial and which the jury disbelieved, broadly, that you
         were not responsible criminally in the circumstances of this  case.
         Accordingly, I am unable to take into account by way of  mitigation
         any realisation or acceptance by you of your  guilt  in  this  case
         despite the submissions made on your behalf."

 5. In my judgment, that  was  a  damning  indictment  of  the  appellant's
    assertion as to his role.  It was a role which was not accepted by  the
    jury nor was it a role that was accepted by Mr Recorder Davis-White QC.
     Without wishing to go into the levels of criminality involved,  it  is
    sufficient to say that the appellant's involvement merited  a  sentence
    of 2 � years' imprisonment, which was not the subject of any successful
    challenge to  the  Court  of  Appeal.   Consequently,  any  attempt  to
    marginalise or reduce the impact of the criminality is something  which
    I firmly reject.  There was a criminal offence which was committed  and
    it was a criminal offence which merited a sentence of 2 � years.

 6. The basis upon which the judge came to his view is in part reflected in
    the OASys Report.  At E8 in answer to the question "Does  the  offender
    accept responsibility for the  current  offence?"  the  writer  of  the
    report wrote "No" and this was followed by his saying "Mr Akonedo  does
    not accept responsibility  for  this  offence,  claiming  that  in  his
    culture if you are asked by family members to help them, then  you  are
    duty-bound to help".  This response is repeated in essence in  what  we
    see at page E31 and in response to which the writer says:

         "Mr Akonedo is fully  capable  and  motivated  to  do  whatever  is
         required of him.  Mr Akonedo  just  needs  to  remember  that  some
         actions  have  consequences  and  these  are  sometimes  not   very
         favourable as he has found out with this offence....Should a member
         of Mr Akonedo's family from Nigeria contact him and ask  for  help,
         he will feel duty-bound in helping them, without fully  considering
         the consequences."

 7. The conclusion that is reached as to the risk of reoffending is set out
    in the summary sheet found  at  E29.   In  relation  to  lifestyle  and
    associates, the link which is suggested to the risk of reoffending,  it
    is said in response to that question "Yes" and that obviously  sums  up
    what is said in the passages to which I have referred earlier.  When it
    comes to the Predictor Scores  Percentage  and  Risk  Category,  it  is
    perfectly true that the  writer  considered  that  the  probability  of
    proven reoffending was low.  It is this  factor  which  is  almost  the
    exclusive consideration relied on in this appeal by Mr Mupara but,  for
    reasons which are apparent, one has  to  look  at  the  report  in  its
    totality.

 8. In effect, what the report was saying was this was a weak man  who  may
    be led into temptation and particularly led into temptation  if  he  is
    asked by members of his family to do something which is unlawful.  That
    was exactly what happened in this case.  It was not  a  case  where  he
    acted for gain.  There is no suggestion that he made any profit out  of
    what happened.  He is leagues away from being a criminal trafficker  of
    people for profit but then so was the sentence.  As the judge noted  in
    paragraph 21 of his determination, "Parliament has seen fit to increase
    the maximum sentences from seven years then to ten  years  and  now  to
    fourteen years" but the range seen in the sentencing  guidelines  is  a
    range between three and fourteen years.  That reflects, in my judgment,
    the seriousness which is attached to this type of offence.

 9. Mr Mupara relies upon the fact that the appellant was only sentenced to
    two and a half years as being an indication that  in  relation  to  the
    range of offences of this category his offending was low.  I agree that
    his offending comes at the lowest edge of the guidelines but  that,  on
    its own, fails to acknowledge that this is a serious offence and  which
    merited a  serious  sentence  for  a  first  offender  of  2  �  years'
    imprisonment.  That was the way the judge approached this case  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  He said in paragraph 19:

         "The Recorder continued to state that having heard the evidence  at
         the trial, he took the view that the appellant's involvement in the
         case was key and not marginal in the way  that  the  appellant  had
         suggested to probation.  He formed the view that in  the  probation
         report it was quite clear that rather than accepting responsibility
         for his criminal offence, the appellant seemed to regard himself as
         the victim of the offence and that he  has  asserted  to  probation
         that it is  all  down  to  his  brother.   The  Recorder  comments,
         however, that this clearly was not accepted by  the  jury  and  the
         jury found him to be criminally responsible."

    I mention this passage because, in  my  judgment,  it  is  an  entirely
    accurate summation of what the sentencing judge was saying.   There  is
    nothing in paragraph 19 of the determination which is a departure  from
    the way the Recorder approached this offence and his  approach  towards
    sentencing.

10. The judge then went on  to  deal  with  the  OASys  assessment  and  in
    paragraph 28 he records:

         "I can find no evidence that Mr Akonedo's lifestyle  is  linked  to
         his offending and he does not knowingly mix with  other  criminals.
         However, if his version of events is to be believed then I  believe
         that should the  situation  arise  and  another  one  of  his  many
         brothers or sisters asks for help again then he may feel duty-bound
         to assist."

    That was what the OASys Report said and it was  an  accurate  quotation
    from it.  The judge then accepts that the risk of offending  is  stated
    to be low.  That was the material that was before the judge in relation
    to the OASys Report.

11. He then went on to consider what  risk  factors  there  might  be.   In
    paragraph 35 he records the evidence of the appellant.  He states that:



     "[The appellant] was asked if his family was  in  debt  and  said  that
         they were to the extent of about �14,000 which was owed in rent  to
         the council.  He states that he is paying that off at between  �300
         and �400 per month."

     It was said by Mr Mupara that the appellant did not mention �14,000 and
    that he mentioned debts owing to the council of some �3,842.  In  fact,
    I have consulted the Record of Proceedings and  when  asked  about  his
    debt the appellant did in fact say that it was �14,000  and  Mr  Kotas,
    who appears on behalf of the Secretary of State, also has a record that
    this was the level of debt about which the appellant gave evidence.  It
    is said that this level of debt was in fact in relation  to  a  student
    loan but there is no evidence of this and he also  submitted  that  the
    appellant did not know the level of his student debt.

12. However, whatever the level of student debt, the fact remains that  the
    appellant was asked about the extent of his indebtedness and  gave  the
    answer "�14,000".  It is, however, accepted in the documents that  were
    provided that the amount of debt owed in  rent  was  some  �3,800  odd.
    That appears from pages 56 and 57.  In fact, the account is  a  running
    account which runs backwards so it is page 57 which states the original
    debt on 29 June 2015.  That was at a level which was only �897 and when
    one sees as the weeks go by that the level of  debt  is  increased  and
    that there are virtually no payments  being  made,  this  is  obviously
    consistent with the fact that the appellant was in prison at  the  time
    and that no other source of rent payment  appears  to  have  been  made
    apart from those payments which are very occasionally seen.  So, at the
    beginning, at the top of page 56, one sees that by 2 January  2017  the
    level of debt had risen to �3,873.88.  The appellant was released on 14
    November 2016 and we can see that there was one payment that  was  made
    of �400 at about the time of his release or shortly after which  showed
    a reduction in the amount of indebtedness.

13. The other letter in the relevant part of the bundle is  found  at  page
    54.  It is a letter from Harlow Council  dated  20  October  2016.   It
    deals with the current outstanding debt and the court costs  and  those
    together totalled �3,842.78.  There was in fact no  additional  written
    evidence in relation to the paying off of  the  debts  between  January
    2017 and the hearing before  the  judge  although  I  accept  that  the
    appellant says that he was paying off that debt at the rate of  between
    �300 and �400 a month.  That was the evidence about his debt.

14. We then go to look at some answers that were provided to the  judge  in
    relation to relatives in Nigeria.  Ms Akonedo was giving  evidence  and
    she was asked whether she had any relatives in Nigeria and she  replied
    "Yes, my dad's mum." In addition to that  she  was  asked  whether  her
    father went to see his mother on trips  he  made  to  Nigeria  and  she
    replied "Yes".  Ms Akonedo is the appellant's daughter.

15. The judge then came to his conclusions.  He concluded that the  offence
    of assisting unlawful  immigration  into  an  EU  member  state  was  a
    sufficiently serious one to justify the appellant's removal on  serious
    grounds of public policy or public security.  This is the correct  test
    to be applied in relation to a person  who  has  acquired  a  permanent
    right of residence.  That was found in Regulation 21 of the Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006, which provides in 21(3):

     "A relevant decision may not be taken in respect of  a  person  with  a
         permanent right of residence under Regulation 15 except on  serious
         grounds of public policy or public security."

     The Rules have now been changed by the introduction of the  2016  Rules
    but those did not apply in the circumstances  of  this  case.   In  any
    event, they are substantially the same.

16. The crucial finding in relation to the determination of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is that in paragraph 55 he records:

     "I accepted that the OASys Report finds the chances  of  the  appellant
         reoffending to be low but I was concerned  with  his  inability  to
         accept  his  guilt  as  evidenced  by  his  disagreement  with  the
         Recorder's remarks as to his role."

17. I shall deal with this point separately.  I have  already  pointed  out
    what the Recorder said in relation  to  his  offending.   The  Recorder
    categorised him as taking a key part in what occurred.  In paragraph 31
    of the determination the  judge  notes  the  cross-examination  of  the
    appellant.  He was asked whether he agreed with the  Recorder  that  he
    was a key player in the attempt  to  gain  entry  to  Slovakia  for  Ms
    Sunday.  He disagreed with the Recorder when he suggested that he  was.
    In  my  judgment,  those  words  are  perfectly  plain  and  it  is   a
    disagreement that the appellant has always had with the  way  his  case
    was approached by the Recorder and, in my judgment, it is not  open  to
    the appellant to assert that he was not a key player and  certainly  he
    is not able to assert that he was not lawfully subjected to a  sentence
    of imprisonment of 2 � years.

18. So, when it comes to what  the  judge  had  said  in  paragraph  55,  I
    entirely accept that the appellant had always sought  to  minimise  his
    involvement.  Indeed that was the essence of the submissions that  were
    made on the appellant's behalf by Mr Mupara.  He  sought  to  say  that
    this was an offence which was at the lowest level and  that  it  should
    therefore not have attracted the classification made by  the  judge  as
    justifying deportation on serious grounds of public  policy  or  public
    security.  I reject that submission and I reject the criticism made  of
    the judge's remarks that the appellant disagreed  with  the  Recorder's
    remarks as to his role.  I am satisfied that  the  appellant  certainly
    did.

19. The judge went on to say in paragraph 55:

     "I was  also  concerned  about  possible  familial  pressure  from  the
         appellant's siblings in the UK and possibly  relatives  in  Nigeria
         who might attempt to get him to repeat this behaviour."

20. Once again, that comment was entirely justified  by  reference  to  the
    evidence that the appellant himself gave as to his relatives in Nigeria
    and the passages found in the OASys Report which expressly refer to the
    fact that the appellant, through weakness, might  be  persuaded  to  go
    along with suggestions that were made by members of his  family.   This
    could not have been more clearly demonstrated than at page E8 where  it
    was said: "Mr Akonedo does not accept responsibility for this  offence,
    claiming that in his culture if you are asked by family members to help
    them, then you are duty-bound to help."  Mr Mupara suggested that  that
    merely referred to helping out a family member and had  nothing  to  do
    with helping out a family member  in  perpetrating  criminal  offences.
    That is certainly not what the OASys Report was  directed  towards  and
    nor is it what we know to have been the circumstances of this  offence,
    which were that, through weakness, the appellant merely went along with
    what his relatives were saying.  Indeed, he sought to blame his brother
    as being the one who was most responsible.  Accordingly, this challenge
    to the First-tier Tribunal's determination also fails.

21. The judge went on to say:

     "I was also concerned with the extensive level of  debt  faced  by  the
         appellant's family and the possible temptation for the appellant to
         take part in similar  behaviour  again  because  of  his  financial
         troubles."

     It is said on the appellant's behalf that he was in  no  way  motivated
    by financial gain in the offence that he committed.  I entirely  accept
    that.  That is not, however, the point that the judge was  making.   He
    heard evidence that there were extensive debts.  Whether that was right
    or wrong is not for me to say.  All I can say  is  that  this  was  the
    level of debt that  the  appellant  admitted  to  in  his  evidence  as
    recorded by the judge in his note of  it.   It  is  accepted  that  the
    council debt was nothing like as great as that and that stood at �3,800
    odd pounds but nevertheless the point that the  judge  was  making  was
    that where there are grounds for temptation and where is a  person  who
    is subject to temptation then that was a possible risk.  He was  saying
    no more than that and was identifying it simply as a risk factor.

22. In paragraph 56 of his determination he concludes:

     "Having considered all the evidence, I find that there is a  real  risk
         that the appellant may well reoffend  by  committing  crimes  of  a
         similar nature."

     If there is to be a challenge of that finding it has to be a  challenge
    on the basis that it is perverse or irrational, that there was no basis
    upon which a judge properly considering  the  evidence  could  lawfully
    come to that conclusion.

23. In my judgment, there was  no  unlawfulness  or  irrationality  in  the
    conclusion at paragraph 56.  It is true that  he  did  not  regard  the
    assessment of the risk of reoffending, which was stated to be  low,  as
    determinative but then it was not determinative  and  for  the  reasons
    which I have given there was ample material  in  the  OASys  Report  to
    suggest that the risk had to be looked at holistically, as  it  was  by
    the judge in  his  determination.   In  those  circumstances,  when  he
    concludes in paragraph 70  that  the  offending  amounted  to  'serious
    grounds of public policy or public security' justifying the appellant's
    deportation, he was both applying the right test and was relying  on  a
    finding of fact as to the nature of the offending  which  was  properly
    open to him.

24. In my judgment, the nature of  this  type  of  offence  should  not  be
    overlooked.  It is true that it is not one of the categories  sometimes
    referred to as being particularly serious crimes but that does not mean
    to say that it is not a serious offence and  it  is  an  offence  which
    undermines the system  of  immigration  control  and  accordingly  does
    undermine 'one of the fundamental interests of society'.   It  poses  a
    sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of   those   fundamental
    interests.  The judge was able to conclude that the offending fell into
    that category.

25. He then went on to deal with the balance that had to  be  struck/   The
    balance that had to be struck was that the appellant is  married  to  a
    Dutch national and they have been living in the United Kingdom for many
    years.  They have four children.  The judge recorded  in  paragraph  64
    that s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 required
    him to consider the  best  interests  of  the  children  as  a  primary
    consideration  and  he  did  so  particularly  by  reference   to   the
    appellant's two younger children, his sons, who were born in  2000  and
    2007 respectively.  He  also  noted  that  the  appellant's  two  elder
    daughters are not dependent on him as they are over 18 years of age and
    attending university.

26. The judge made  it  perfectly  plain  that  he  entirely  rejected  the
    respondent's submission that the appellant was not  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with his children.  The respondent had
    submitted that the appellant's removal would  not  have  a  significant
    impact on  the  children  of  the  family.   I  find  it  difficult  to
    understand how that submission could  have  been  made  but  the  judge
    emphatically disagreed with it and found that the  appellant's  removal
    would have a devastating effect on the family and  that  would  include
    his wife, who requires considerable assistance due to her disability.

27. Accordingly, it cannot be said, as is asserted in the grounds, that the
    judge did not take into account the interests of the  children  but  he
    considered, as he did expressly in paragraph 70 of  the  determination,
    that notwithstanding the effect that this would have on the  appellant,
    his wife and two younger children that the appellant's criminal offence
    and real risk of reoffending outweighed that damage and  thus,  on  the
    proportionality balance, it justified the appellant's removal.

28. I entirely agree that this is a regrettable consequence as far  as  the
    effect on the family is concerned but that, unhappily, is what  happens
    when there is criminal offending.  The criminal offending is aggravated
    by a failure to recognise properly that the offending  took  place  and
    the judge was right, in my judgment, in relying upon that as one of the
    factors which was in his mind when  considering  whether  there  was  a
    future risk.  I do not find that the judge reached a decision which was
    irrational and the submissions that were made on the appellant's behalf
    were in effect an attempt to reopen the argument which Mr Mupara  quite
    properly and forcefully made before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  but
    which the judge did not accede to.

29. In those circumstances my decision is that the judge made no  error  of
    law and accordingly the determination of the appeal should stand.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Judge made no error  on  a  point  of  law  and  his
determination of the appeal shall stand.

                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
