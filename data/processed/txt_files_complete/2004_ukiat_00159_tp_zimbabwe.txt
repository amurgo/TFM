For the respondent:    Mr G Elks, Senior Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. The appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, appeals with permission  against
      the determination of  an  adjudicator,  Mr  I  F  Taylor,  sitting  at
      Nottingham, in which he dismissed on asylum and human  rights  grounds
      the appellant's appeal against the decision of the  respondent  on  20
      June 2003 to give directions for  the  appellant's  removal  from  the
      United Kingdom.


   2.   The Vice President who granted permission to appeal appears to  have
      done so in circumstances where he only had the odd- numbered pages  of
      the determination.  That may to some extent account for the reason why
      he granted permission, in that it would not have been plain  precisely
      what credibility findings the adjudicator was making.


   3. Be that as it may, however, the grounds of  appeal  contend  that  the
      adjudicator erred in basing his adverse  credibility  findings  wholly
      upon the situation in which the appellant came to claim asylum.   That
      situation was essentially as follows.


   4. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom by air on 25  April  2001.
      At that stage, as he told the adjudicator, his intention was  just  to
      stay quiet in the United Kingdom until the Presidential  elections  in
      Zimbabwe in March 2002.  In any event, the appellant gained access  to
      the United Kingdom for the purposes of study  and  did  not  tell  the
      immigration authorities that he had had problems in Zimbabwe.  That in
      itself is surprising, given that the appellant on his own account  was
      fleeing the hostile attentions of ZANU-PF supporters, who had gone  so
      far as to burn down the home in which he was living.


   5. After the elections in March 2002, the appellant still did  not  claim
      asylum.  He told the adjudicator that his reason for not doing  so  at
      this stage was because he  was  unaware  of  the  procedure  until  he
      discussed the matter with friends.  The adjudicator at paragraph 11 of
      his determination did not accept that explanation from a  person  whom
      he found to be "an educated and intelligent young man".


   6. Furthermore, the adjudicator noted that  even  after  this  point  the
      appellant made no attempt to seek asylum.  Indeed, he did so only when
      he was apprehended by the police and arrested for  driving  a  vehicle
      with no insurance.  That occurred in May  2002.   At  that  point  the
      appellant was told he was about  to  be  deported  and  the  appellant
      thereupon claimed asylum.


   7. The adjudicator found that the  appellant's  immigration  history  was
      "wholly inconsistent with his claim to have  suffered  persecution  at
      the hands of the ZANU-PF and war veterans in Zimbabwe.  In my view  if
      he had suffered such a persecution he would have claimed asylum at the
      first available opportunity and would not have waited until 11th  hour
      when he was about to be deported. I  find  his  explanations  for  not
      claiming asylum to be wholly unsatisfactory and  untrue.   It  follows
      therefore that I do not accept his accounts of events in Zimbabwe.  In
      the circumstances of  this  case  the  appellant's  asylum  appeal  is
      dismissed" (determination paragraph 11).


   8. In her submission to the Tribunal this afternoon, Miss Zafar urged  us
      to find that it was insufficient  for  the  adjudicator  to  base  his
      credibility findings on these matters and the he should have gone into
      the detail of the claim regarding harassment and persecution by  ZANU-
      PF.


   9.  The  Tribunal  is  wholly  unable  to  accept  that  submission.  The
      adjudicator was, in the circumstances of this case, fully entitled  to
      have regard to  the  immigration  history  of  the  appellant  and  in
      particular the precise circumstances in which the claim for asylum was
      belatedly made and to conclude from all this that the appellant was  a
      person of no credibility.


  10. It is highly significant that the appellant claimed asylum only in the
      immediate aftermath of being apprehended by the police for  committing
      what would appear to be a criminal offence and after he was threatened
      with deportation.


  11.    There  is  no  point  whatsoever  in  the  adjudicator   in   those
      circumstances having to look in substance  at  the  appellant's  claim
      regarding  what  was  supposed  to  have  happened  in  Zimbabwe.  The
      adjudicator found that that claim was wholly false and he has given  a
      legally sufficient reason for  so  doing.  It  is  asserted  that,  in
      proceeding as he did, the adjudicator failed to give  the  appeal  his
      "anxious scrutiny". On the  facts  of  the  case,  we  find  that  the
      adjudicator has given the requisite degree of scrutiny to the entirety
      of the appellants claim for protection in the United Kingdom.


  12. This appeal is dismissed.
