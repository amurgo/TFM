Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood (Home Office Specialist Appeals Team)

For the Respondent:    Ms S Anzani (counsel for Connaughts)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal of 27 July 2018 to allow the  appeals  of  Mr
       [Q] and Mrs [A] against the refusal of their human  rights  claim  as
       adult dependent relatives on 23 February 2018.


    2. Mr [Q] and Mrs [A] came to the UK as visitors  on  5  June  2016  and
       applied for leave to remain on 25 November 2016. As explained in  the
       representations supporting their application, it had not  been  their
       intention to apply for long-term leave when they entered  the  UK  in
       2016; however Mr [Q] had had a mental breakdown on 20 November  2016,
       which the history provided by a psychiatrist placed in the context of
       a series of bereavements, and was no longer able  to  administer  his
       wife's care. They had previously had servants to care  for  them  but
       the last one had attempted to murder them. They had relatives in  the
       UK by way of their children, grandchildren, and daughters-in-law, all
       of whom were settled here. Their son financed their care whilst their
       daughters-in-law provided the physical and  emotional  support.  They
       had previously visited the UK on five occasions.

    3. In evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, Mr [Q] stated  his  three
       brothers had passed away; he and Mrs [A] remained in contact with his
       daughters in  Pakistan  but  they  were  not  able  to  cooperate  in
       providing care for him and his wife. Before coming to the UK, he  and
       Mrs [A] had lived together in Islamabad, relying on  money  from  his
       elder son and Mr [Q]'s pension. They had received help from Zafar,  a
       carer who did their cleaning and shopping, and who  worked  for  them
       for under a year, until January 2016. There had then been an incident
       of theft, following which the police visited their house, though  the
       officers demanded money rather than showing any interest  in  solving
       the crime. The Respondents had paid for their health treatment in the
       UK via the health surcharge paid on their immigration application.

    4. Mrs  [A]  gave  evidence,  confirming  that  she  and  her  husband's
       daughters remained in touch though could speak only on the  telephone
       when their in-laws were absent. Their servant had taken good care  of
       her until he came to their home one night resulting in  them  calling
       the police, who had advised them not to hire servants; they  did  not
       hire another home help. Nobody lived in their home now.

    5. The First-tier Tribunal made findings of fact, observing that Mr  [Q]
       had attended the hearing in a wheelchair and was plainly unwell,  and
       had had cancer treatment including an operation in March 2016; he had
       other medical conditions including osteoarthritis, limited  mobility,
       and could not travel long distances. Ms [A]  suffered  from  anxiety,
       depression, dementia and other health conditions, and had  a  history
       of suicidal ideation. The evidence regarding the  servant  Zafar  was
       considered somewhat vague.

    6. The Judge applied the legal regime  to  those  factual  findings.  He
       noted that their counsel accepted that the couple could not meet  the
       requirements of the Rules. The  Respondents  were  in  poor  physical
       health and needed the help of their family members in the  UK.  Their
       married daughters in Pakistan were unable to  maintain  any  physical
       contact with them because of the strictness of the families they  had
       joined. They had close family ties with the  UK  family  members  and
       that the support network and medical services available  to  them  in
       the UK were sufficient. In the light  of  these  considerations,  the
       First-tier Tribunal allowed the appeal on the basis that there  would
       be very significant obstacles to the couple's return to Pakistan, and
       additionally "outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8 ECHR".

    7. The Judge found that the failure to apply under the  entry  clearance
       route was explained by the fact they had repeatedly made arrangements
       to  leave  the  country  which  had   been   frustrated   by   health
       arrangements.

    8. The Secretary of State appealed, on the basis that

        a) The supposed "very significant obstacles to integration" in
           Pakistan had not been detailed;


        b) No consideration had been given as to why the UK-based family
           could not relocate to Pakistan;


        c) The high test in Kugathas had not been applied.

    9. Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  10
       October 2018 on the basis that all those grounds were arguable.


   10. Before me, Ms Isherwood submitted that  relevant  considerations  had
       been overlooked. There was no consideration of  whether  family  life
       was established, applying the appropriate case law. As per Ribeli, it
       was necessary to consider whether the Sponsor could relocate  to  the
       country of origin where the appeal was put under Article 8 which  did
       not protect a simple preference for living in one country rather than
       another. The Judge had failed to assess the case in  the  context  of
       the adult dependent route under the Immigration Rules, which featured
       particularly strong strictures vis-�-vis care needs and availability.



   11. Ms Anzani submitted that the Judge was entitled to reach the findings
       he had made, given that he had heard  live  evidence.  Reference  was
       made in  her  skeleton  below  as  to  the  availability  of  medical
       treatment.

Findings and reasons

   12. It is appropriate to address the family life ground of appeal  first.
       It is true that the First-tier Tribunal did not in terms address  the
       appropriate test for family life, which, for adult family members, is
       that set out in Advic v UK (1995) 20 EHRR CD  125:  i.e.  the  normal
       emotional ties between a parent and an adult  son  or  daughter  will
       not, without more, suffice to constitute family life: Kugathas [2003]
       EWCA Civ 31. Buxton LJ emphasised in MT (Zimbabwe)  [2007]  EWCA  Civ
       455 at [11] that Advic, "whilst stressing the need for an element  of
       dependency over and above the normal between  that  of  a  parent  or
       parent figure and adult child, also stresses that everything  depends
       on the circumstances of each  case".  The  Upper  Tribunal  President
       wrote in Lama [2017] UKUT 16 (IAC) �32 that  "at  its  heart,  family
       life denotes real or committed personal support between or among  the
       persons concerned."

   13. Health problems may of course be highly relevant  to  the  degree  of
       dependency a migrant  has  upon  their  family  here,  and  thus  may
       contribute towards satisfaction of the Advic/Kugathas test.  In  such
       cases the claim does not have to pass the high threshold for "health"
       cases  which  are  wholly  dependent  on  the  differential   between
       treatment in the UK and abroad. As noted by Underhill LJ in GS  India
       [2015] EWCA Civ 40  �111,  "where  article  8  is  engaged  by  other
       factors, the fact that the claimant is receiving medical treatment in
       this country which may not be available in the country of return  may
       be a factor in the proportionality exercise; but that  factor  cannot
       be treated as by itself giving rise to  a  breach  since  that  would
       contravene the "no obligation to treat"  principle."  Alongside  him,
       Laws LJ wrote �86: "If the Article 3 claim fails ... Article 8 cannot
       prosper without some separate or  additional  factual  element  which
       brings the case within the Article 8 paradigm - the capacity to  form
       and enjoy relationships - or a state of affairs having some  affinity
       with the paradigm."

   14. A mixed family and private life claim, as where a parent  is  heavily
       dependent on their adult children for emotional as well  as  physical
       support, might satisfy that threshold: as was noted in MM  (Zimbabwe)
       [2012] EWCA Civ 279 at [23], where "the appellant  ha[s]  established
       firm family ties in this country, then the availability of continuing
       medical treatment here, coupled with his  dependence  on  the  family
       here for support,  [may]  together  establish  'private  life'  under
       Article 8 ...  Such a finding would not offend the principle ... that
       the United Kingdom is  under  no  Convention  obligation  to  provide
       medical treatment here when it is not available  in  the  country  to
       which the appellant is to be deported."

   15. It would plainly be open to a decision maker  to  find  that  elderly
       parents with a combination of physical and mental  health  dependency
       on their UK resident children enjoyed family life with them. However,
       no reasoned finding to such effect was made here. That is an error of
       law. It is doubtful that that would have necessarily been a  material
       error, given that, on the evidence here, any other finding would have
       been surprising. However, there are more significant difficulties.

   16. In so far as the appeal was considered within the Immigration  Rules,
       the only  available  route  was  Rule  276ADE(vi),  which  the  Judge
       concluded was satisfied.  That  Rule  focusses  on  the  question  of
       whether there are very significant obstacles to  integration  in  the
       country of origin. However, there is minimal reasoning on this issue;
       virtually everything stated in the  material  part  of  the  decision
       relates to UK connections rather than to circumstances  in  Pakistan.
       Once again, it is self-evident that it might not be a great leap from
       the premise of serious health problems for  elderly  relatives  to  a
       conclusion that they could not integrate abroad; but here the parents
       had lived in Pakistan until relatively recently, and had clearly been
       able to survive there notwithstanding that they were  estranged  from
       their adult daughters resident  there.  The  evidence  regarding  the
       problems with the carer were described as "vague" by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal, understandably  given  the  differing  accounts  summarised
       above as to the circumstances leading  to  the  servant's  discharge.
       There needs to be a rather full consideration of the facts  before  a
       lawful finding on obstacles to integration can be made.

   17. The appeal was also allowed outside  the  scope  of  the  Immigration
       Rules. As stated by Lord Carnwath  and  Lady  Hale  in  MM  (Lebanon)
       [2017] UKSC 10 �66, it is  now  generally  accepted  that  Article  8
       considerations cannot be "fitted into a rigid  template  provided  by
       the rules, so as in effect to exclude consideration by  the  tribunal
       of special cases outside the rules ... this would be  a  negation  of
       the evaluative exercise required in assessing the proportionality  of
       a measure under article 8 of the Convention which excludes any 'hard-
       edged or bright-line rule to be applied to the generality of cases'".

   18. However, the ability of a case to succeed outside  the  Rules'  rigid
       template does not mean that there is not a certain minimum  threshold
       to reach: hence the shorthand requirement for something "compelling",
       and it is necessary to follow  through  a  structured  assessment  in
       order to come to a lawful conclusion  to  such  effect.  One  notable
       feature of the decision below is the extreme brevity of the treatment
       of section 117B. The Upper Tribunal stated in Forman [2015] UKUT  412
       (IAC) that:

           "In cases where the provisions of sections 117B-117C of the 2002
           Act arise, the decision of the Tribunal  must  demonstrate  that
           they have been given full effect."

   19. In Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA  Civ  803  �45,  Sales  LJ  noted  that  "the
       starting point for consideration of the proper construction  of  Part
       5A of the 2002 Act is that sections 117A-117D,  taken  together,  are
       intended to provide for a structured approach to the  application  of
       Article 8 which produces  in  all  cases  a  final  result  which  is
       compatible with, and not in violation of, Article 8."


   20. The key  considerations  identified  by  section  117B  are  language
       proficiency, precariousness  of  immigration  status,  and  financial
       independence. The First-tier Tribunal addressed the second  of  these
       factors, but had very little regard to the other two.  There  was  no
       detailed analysis of whether there was cogent evidence to demonstrate
       an absence of threat  to  the  public  purse  regarding  the  medical
       expenses; given the case was apparently put below on the  basis  that
       there had been no net cost to public funds as the Immigration  Health
       Surcharge had been  paid,  there  was  clearly  some  possibility  of
       further public expense, given the extensive health  problems  of  the
       Respondents,  that might not be adequately covered  by  a  relatively
       modest upfront  payment  to  the  UK  authorities.  No  evidence  was
       referred to regarding English language proficiency in the  Tribunal's
       conclusions.

   21. The correct approach in a health case, as shown by Akhalu [2013] UKUT
       400 (IAC) addressing questions  of  Article  8,  proportionality  and
       health, is not to leave out of account  the  financial  dimension  of
       such a case: it is essential to  recognise  that  the  countervailing
       public interest in removal will outweigh  the  consequences  for  the
       health of  the  claimant  because  of  a  disparity  of  health  care
       facilities in all but a very few rare cases.

   22. The statutory public interest factors are not the only considerations
       relevant to proportionality. There are of  course  Immigration  Rules
       which  address  the  circumstances   of   dependent   relatives.   An
       application made from abroad in the Respondents' circumstances would,
       had it been duly made under the Rules, have had to  demonstrate  that
       they required "long-term personal care to perform everyday tasks" due
       to "age, illness or disability"; and  that  such  care  must  not  be
       available "in the country where they are living" because  it  is  not
       available in the sense that there is nobody  who  can  reasonably  be
       expected to provide it, or it is unaffordable. The latter aspects  of
       that enquiry were dealt with very scantily here: it is  unclear  what
       healthcare would be available in Pakistan or indeed whether there are
       relatives there who might help the Respondent access  it.  Ms  Anzani
       indubitably  referenced  these  factors  in  her  admirably   concise
       skeleton argument for  the  hearing  below  (though  the  Appellant's
       bundle index  does  not  seem  to  identify  the  underlying  country
       evidence); however, that material was nevertheless not  addressed  by
       the First-tier Tribunal, whose duty it was to assess the issue.

   23. The strictures of the adult dependent relative route are an important
       reference  point  in  assessing  the  difference  between  the   care
       arrangements in this country and abroad.  Those  strictures  are  not
       insurmountable, but require objective assessment, as explained by Sir
       Terence Etherton MR in Britcits [2017] EWCA Civ 368 �59, who  pointed
       out that it  would  be  necessary  to  weigh  the  accessibility  and
       geographical location of the provision  of  care  and  its  standard,
       having regard to its emotional and psychological  elements,  verified
       by appropriate medical evidence.

   24. Finally, there is the Ribeli point. Singh LJ stated in Ribeli  [2018]
       EWCA Civ 611:

           "69.  The crucial point (and it is a powerful point as a  matter
           of common sense as  well  as  a  matter  of  law)  is  that  the
           Appellant's daughter could reasonably be expected to go back  to
           South Africa to provide the emotional support her  mother  needs
           as well as to provide practical support.  For  example,  if  the
           concern is that the Appellant may be cared for in  her  home  by
           people who may turn out not  to  be  trustworthy,  there  is  no
           reason why her daughter cannot live and work in South Africa  to
           supervise the care arrangements made for her mother.


           70.   As the UT Judge observed, at the end of the day, what this
           case is about is the choice which Ms Steenkamp has exercised and
           wishes to be able to continue to exercise of living and  working
           in a major international centre like London rather than in South
           Africa, which is her own country of origin. She is  entitled  to
           exercise that choice. But, in those circumstances, the UT cannot
           be  faulted  for  having  come  to  the  conclusion   that   any
           interference with the Appellant's right to  respect  for  family
           life conforms to the principle of proportionality."

   25. It must be appreciated that the ruling there is a fact-sensitive one,
       and what is reasonable for one  family  may  not  be  reasonable  for
       another. Here there may well be extensive ties  between  the  various
       family members and the UK that  represent  a  different  backdrop  to
       circumstances in Ribeli. However, that was a matter  with  which  the
       First-tier Tribunal ought to have engaged.


   26. I accordingly find that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       cannot stand. Given that all the issues in  the  appeal  require  re-
       determination, the matter must be remitted for re-hearing afresh.

Decision:

The appeal is allowed to the extent that the  appeal  is  remitted  for  re-
hearing afresh, with no preserved findings.
