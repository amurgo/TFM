                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction:


      1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Mills (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the
         "FtTJ") promulgated on the 13 March 2020, in which the  appellant's
         appeal against the decision to refuse his human rights  application
         dated 20 February 2019 was dismissed.



      2. The hearing took place on 9 December 2020  and  resumed  on  the  6
         January 2021, by means  of  Skype  for  Business.  which  has  been
         consented to and not objected to by  the  parties.  A  face-to-face
         hearing was not held because  it  was  not  practicable,  and  both
         parties agreed that all issues could  be  determined  in  a  remote
         hearing.  I conducted the hearing from court at Bradford  IAC.  The
         advocates attended remotely via video as did the  sponsor  so  that
         she could hear and take part in  the  proceedings  remotely.  There
         were no  issues  regarding  sound,  and  no  substantial  technical
         problems were encountered during the hearing  and  I  am  satisfied
         both advocates were able to make  their  respective  cases  by  the
         chosen means.

      3. I am grateful to Mr Iqbal  and  Ms  Everett  for  their  clear  and
         helpful oral submissions.


Background:

      4. The appellant is a national of Egypt. He married his wife (the
         "sponsor SR") who is a British Citizen, on the 24 September 2013 in
         Egypt having met through friends and originally via the telephone.
         In 2013 the sponsor went to visit the appellant; they became
         engaged and subsequently married there.


      5. Following the marriage in September 2013 the parties remained
         living together in Egypt. In 2014 the sponsor obtained employment
         in Saudi Arabia and they moved to live and work there.

      6. Whilst in Saudi Arabia, their child was born on 15 May 2016. They
         returned to Egypt and after a short period of time, the sponsor and
         her son moved to the United Kingdom leaving the appellant in Egypt.

      7. On 20 February 2019 he made an application for entry clearance as
         the partner of the sponsor who is a British citizen. In the
         covering letter sent with the application, it was said that the
         sponsor was not earning enough to meet the minimum income
         requirement of the rules because she could only work part-time was
         caring for their child who had been born in May 2016. Thus the
         application relied on there being "exceptional circumstances" such
         that GEN 3.1 of Appendix FM applied, and alternative sources of
         income could be relied upon to make up the shortfall. The
         alternative source relied upon was third party support from
         sponsor's father.


      8. The ECO refused the application in a decision dated 10 June 2019.
         The reasons given for refusing the application can be summarised as
         follows. The ECO considered the application under section EC - P of
         Appendix FM but found the rules were not met. Specifically, the ECO
         considered that the sponsor had failed to demonstrate that she
         could meet financial requirements of the rules. The ECO also
         considered whether there were any "exceptional circumstances" with
         reference to GEN 1.3 but concluded that there were none and that
         third-party support could not therefore be relied upon.

      9. The appellant appealed against this decision on 11 July 2019
         setting out the same arguments in his grounds of appeal. The ECM
         undertook a review of that decision in light of the grounds of
         appeal, but, in a decision dated 10 September 2019 upheld the
         decision to refuse entry clearance for the reasons given.

     10. The sponsor and their child went to visit the appellant in August
         2019 and stayed for a period of 18 days.


The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal:

     11. The appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision to  refuse
         leave to enter the UK came before the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
         Mills) on the 26 February 2020.

     12. In a determination promulgated on  the  13  March  2020,  the  FtTJ
         dismissed the appeal on human  rights  grounds,  having  considered
         that issue in the light of  the  appellant's  compliance  with  the
         Immigration Rule in question and on Article 8 grounds.

     13. The FtTJ heard evidence from the appellant by  way  of  video  link
         from Egypt and also evidence from the sponsor.  At  paragraph  [18]
         the judge set out the documentation that had been provided  to  the
         tribunal which included a bundle sent by the appellant  running  to
         753 pages. A great deal of that material related  to  the  evidence
         relevant to the issue of third- party support. There  was  also  an
         updated letter from the sponsors employer.

     14. At [19] the  FtTJ  set  out  that  it  had  been  conceded  by  the
         presenting officer at the outset of the hearing that  the  evidence
         of third-party support was satisfactory.  The  FtTJ  recorded  that
         "she accepted that the sponsors father was in a position to make up
         the  shortfall  between  the  sponsor's  income  and  the   �18,600
         threshold required by the rules. The  question  was  whether  there
         were exceptional circumstances in the case such that the  appellant
         was able to rely on that third-party support. Ms Tasmin (presenting
         officer) agreed that if I found that there were then I should allow
         the appeal."

     15. The First-tier Tribunal Judge set out his findings and  reasons  at
         paragraphs [20]-[28] as follows:

         1) the appellant's son's interests were a primary consideration and
            the judge found that it was in his best interests to reside with
            both parents and agreed that it was regrettable  that  this  had
            not been possible for most of his life.

         2) The judge accepted that the sponsor had good  reason  decide  to
            leave Egypt with her son in September 2016 to return to live  in
            United Kingdom, given the instability in Egypt as  well  as  her
            own past experience of having  originally  come  to  the  United
            Kingdom as a refugee many years before.

         3) The judge stated that "were  in  the  case  that  there  was  no
            prospect of the appellant's sponsor being able to earn enough to
            meet  the  financial  requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  such  the
            separation of his family was likely to be very lengthy  or  even
            indefinite, I would likely  accept  that  this  amounted  to  an
            exceptional circumstance, however I cannot find that this is the
            case" (at [21]).

         4) The judge found that at the date of the hearing the sponsor  was
            earning �11,624 which  was  a  shortfall  of  just  under  �7000
            compared to the  income  threshold  and  the  rules.  The  judge
            considered the evidence from her employer (dated 24/2/20)  which
            described her as a "valued member of the team". It  also  stated
            that with her skill set she would have no difficulty in securing
            additional employment if she wished.  Specifically  it  is  said
            that there were several vacancies that she could  apply  for  in
            the next couple of months) at ][22]).

         5) The judge noted the sponsor's oral evidence that if she were  to
            undertake a  current  role  on  a  full-time  basis,  which  was
            possible then she would be earning more than �19,000 per  annum.
            Her evidence was that she forgone an opportunity  for  promotion
            last year because of the childcare issues; had  she  taken  that
            job she would now be earning over �20,000 per annum.

         6) The judge found that "it is quite clear that it  would  be  easy
            for the sponsor to  obtain  employment  needed  to  satisfy  the
            requirements of the rules and it has simply  been  a  matter  of
            choice that she has not yet done so" (at [23]).

         7) The judge considered the reasons given by the sponsor as to  why
            she would not or had not increased her hours; her  evidence  was
            that the sole reason that she  had  not  already  increased  her
            hours because she did not wish to put  her  son  into  full-time
            childcare ( see paragraphs 8 - 10 of her witness statement).

         8) At [25] the FtTJ stated that he  understood  and  respected  the
            sponsors wish to provide direct care to her young son but  could
            not find that the choice that  she  faced  was  "an  exceptional
            one". The FtTJ stated "it is a commonplace situation  in  modern
            society that parents have to make the difficult  choice  to  put
            their  young  children  into  daily  childcare   because   their
            financial circumstances dictate that they must return to work. I
            have not been provided with any evidence  to  suggest  that  the
            appellant's son has suffered any specific detriment  during  the
            three days a week that is already spending in  nursery,  between
            8:45 AM and 3 PM. Moreover, he will soon turn four years of  age
            and  so  will  be  expected  to  start  full-time  education  in
            September 2020."

         9) The FtTJ stated that he did not find it unreasonable  to  expect
            sponsor to work longer hours, which were  already  available  to
            her,  so  that  she  could  sponsor  an  application  for  entry
            clearance without reliance on  third-party  support.  The  judge
            found that she could already have done this long before now  and
            the delay in reuniting the  family  was  "largely  down  to  the
            choices are to be made by the appellant  and  his  wife,  rather
            than because of the ECO's decision ( at [26]).

        10) The judge concluded that it was reasonable and proportionate  to
            expect the appellant and the sponsor to arrange their affairs so
            that they could meet the immigration rules and then  to  make  a
            fresh application for entry clearance (at [26]).

        11) Taking all matters into the round and treating the interests  of
            their child as a primary consideration, the judge stated that he
            did not find that the appellant had satisfied him on the balance
            of probabilities that  there  were  "exceptional  circumstances"
            (meaning unjustifiably harsh consequences) on the facts of  this
            case such that GEN 1.3 applied. The  judge  therefore  concluded
            the appellant was not entitled  to  rely  on  the  third  -party
            support from his father-in-law to meet the immigration rules.

        12) At [28) the judge went on to state that "being  unable  to  meet
            the rules is not necessarily fatal to in Article 8 human  rights
            appeal. However,  the  testing  met  outside  of  the  rules  as
            established by the Supreme Court in Agyarko, is essentially  the
            same as that under GEN1.3 of Appendix FM.  The  judge  therefore
            concluded that the appeal  must  fail  on  the  sole  ground  of
            appeal,  namely  the   refusal   of   entry   clearance   as   a
            disproportionate breach of his rights under  Article  8  of  the
            ECHR.

     16. The  appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  that  decision  and
         permission to appeal was issued and on 12 August  2020,  permission
         to appeal was granted by FtTJ Adio   stating:-

             "At paragraph 23 the judge noted that had the sponsor taken
             full-time employment she would now be earning over �22,000 per
             annum and that it is quite clear that it would be easy for the
             sponsor to obtain employment needed to satisfy the
             requirements of the rules and it had been a matter of choice
             that she had not yet done so. The judge went on to state at
             paragraph 24 the reasons given by the sponsor from her witness
             statement. In analysing that reason, the judge found that he
             fully understood and respected the sponsors wish to provide
             direct care to her young son but could not find that the
             choice that she faced was an exceptional one. The judge went
             on to find that it is a commonplace situation in modern
             society that parents have to make the difficult choice about
             the young children into daily childcare because their
             financial circumstances dictate that they must return to work.
             The judge found that he had not been provided with any
             evidence to suggest that the applicant son had suffered any
             specific detriment during the three days a week that he was
             already spending in nursery. Moreover, he would soon turn four
             years of age and so would be expected to start full-time
             education September 2020. The judge referred to the interests
             of the sun as a primary consideration paragraph 27.
             The grounds on the application for permission to appeal raise
             an arguable error of law. All the money that the sponsor is in
             receipt of has been accepted as being more than �18,600. This
             is also conceded by the respondent at the hearing albeit this
             is made up of the sponsor's income and benefits, however, as
             is argued by the sponsor and her son are entitled to these in
             their own right. It was argued that there was no increased
             reliance on public funds, it is also argued that the judge has
             not had regard to the evidence that the applicant has skills
             that would enable him to work that following his arrival the
             difficulties the family face in respect of childcare would be
             ameliorated allowing them to meet the financial threshold. It
             is therefore argued that conducting a holistic assessment of
             whether the families continue separation is a disproportionate
             interference these matters should have been considered as
             pointed out by counsel.
             It is an arguable point that the applicant's son still needs
             to be cared for by his parents thereby strengthening the bond
             with his primary caregiver. There is no reference to the
             mental health issues of the sponsor as pointed out by counsel
             in the grounds. He also argues that there was evidence for the
             judge in the sponsor had continuing mental health issues in
             particular her diagnosis with reactive depression and anxiety
             said by her doctor to be due to ongoing social issues relating
             to her husband's immigration status. I find all the grounds
             raise arguable errors of law."

The hearing before the Upper Tribunal:

     17. In the light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the  Upper  Tribunal  issued
         directions on the 28 August 2020, inter alia,  indicating  that  it
         was provisionally of the view that the error of law issue could  be
         determined without a face- to- face hearing  and  that  this  could
         take place as a remote hearing. Following those initial  directions
         the hearing was listed for  a  Skype  hearing.  Both  parties  have
         indicated that they were content for the hearing to proceed by this
         method. Therefore, the Tribunal listed the hearing to  enable  oral
         submissions to be given by each of the parties with the  assistance
         of their advocates.

     18. Mr Iqbal on behalf of the appellant relied upon the written grounds
         of appeal and his skeleton argument and a further skeleton argument
         prepared for the hearing on the 6 January 2020.

     19. There was a written  rule  24  response  filed  on  behalf  of  the
         respondent.

     20. I also heard oral submission from the advocates, and I am  grateful
         for their assistance and their clear oral submissions.

The grounds:

     21. It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the evidence before
         the FtTJ given by the sponsor was that she did not  wish  to  place
         their child in full-time childcare because she was  concerned  that
         it would affect her bond with him and would adversely affect him as
         he became older. It is asserted that she provided  evidence  as  to
         how the continued separation was adversely affecting  the  couple's
         son. In addition, it is said that there  was  evidence  before  the
         judge of the sponsor's  continuing  mental  health  issues  and  in
         particular her diagnosis with reactive depression and anxiety which
         was said by her doctor to be due to ongoing social issues  relating
         to her husband's immigration status.  Thus  it  is  submitted  that
         those relevant issues which should have been considered as part  of
         the assessment of whether the family circumstances were  such  that
         the test relying upon third-party  support  under  the  immigration
         rules was met. It is submitted  that  these  were  "key  pieces  of
         evidence" and the judge should have addressed those points.

     22. It is further argued that at paragraph 25  where  the  judge  noted
         that the couple's and will be starting school in September 2020 was
         an "irrelevant matter". The judge  was  required  to  look  at  the
         position as at the date of the hearing and not  what  the  position
         would be in September 2020. In any event, their son would be  seven
         months older  and  thus  at  a  slightly  different  stage  of  his
         childhood. Whilst he may be due to start school in September it  is
         submitted that did not lead to the conclusion  that  he  should  be
         cared for by someone other than a parent outside of the time he  is
         attending school. The point remains that their son still needed  to
         be cared for by his parents thereby strengthening his bond with his
         primary caregiver.

     23. The grounds further submit that in concluding at [28] that  is  the
         test to be met outside the rules is essentially the same  as  under
         GEN 1.3 of Appendix FM,  the  appeal  must  therefore  fail  was  a
         material error of law. It is submitted that there were a number  of
         factors relating to the family's present circumstances  which  were
         not considered. Furthermore, when considering the position  outside
         of immigration rules there are  a  number  of  other  matters  that
         should have been considered but which have not been considered.

     24. The grounds highlight the matters that have not been considered  by
         the FtTJ.

     25. They are summarised as follows:

         1) if his spouse's entire income, including  universal  credit  was
            considered the appellant will be able to show that  the  sponsor
            was in receipt of income in excess of  �18,600.  Whilst  it  was
            accepted  that  the  immigration  rules  exclude  reliance  upon
            universal credit, it was argued that  there  was  no  reasonable
            justification for this. The sponsor is working part-time and  is
            receiving benefits that she and the  couple's  British  son  are
            entitled to in their own right. Thus it was  argued  that  there
            would be no increased reliance on public funds and there appears
            to be no proper justification for preventing those who  have  to
            demonstrate that earnings of at least �18,600 relying on  public
            funds in order to meet the requirement  when  the  public  funds
            relied upon ones  the  sponsor  and  any  British  children  are
            entitled to receive. The judge failed to address this  argument.
            This was a material issue which should have been  considered  by
            the judge when considering whether the decision to refuse  entry
            clearance was in all circumstances disproportionate.

         2) The judge did not have regard to the evidence the appellant  had
            skills that would enable him  to  work  or  that  following  his
            arrival the difficulties  of  the  family  face  in  respect  of
            childcare would be ameliorated allowing them to  meet  financial
            threshold. When conducting a holistic assessment of whether  the
            families continue separation is a disproportionate  interference
            in their article 8 rights, these matters should also  have  been
            considered.

     26. Mr Iqbal on behalf of the respondent submitted  that  it  had  been
         conceded on behalf of the respondent that the  third-party  support
         was sufficient but because there were no exceptional  circumstances
         the third-party support could not be taken into consideration. Thus
         the case rested on whether there were "exceptional circumstances".

     27. In this respect he submitted that whether  there  are  "exceptional
         circumstances" is a  subjective  test  and  not  an  objective  one
         because otherwise there would  be  either  an  exhaustive  list  of
         circumstances    that    are    (or    can    be)    accepted    as
         exceptional/unjustifiably harsh. Or, at the very least,  they  will
         be     examples     demonstrate     what     might      be      the
         circumstances/consequences that  may  be  exceptional/unjustifiably
         harsh.

     28. Mr Iqbal submitted that what is exceptional to one  person  may  be
         normal to another and vice  versa.  He  referred  to  his  skeleton
         argument where he had set out 2 particular points or examples.  The
         first one related to parents opting to go into a care home  may  be
         normal for ethnic British families but it  is  unthinkable  (or  at
         least exceptional) in  South  Asian  and  Middle  Eastern  families
         living in the UK. Similarly, arranged marriages in South Asian  and
         Middle Eastern families are normally an exception  amongst  British
         families.

     29. Thus he submitted there is "no one size fits all"  formula  in  the
         world. Therefore it was material error of  law  for  the  judge  to
         treat   "exceptional   circumstances"   or   "unjustifiably   harsh
         consequences" as an objective test when he held at paragraph 25 "it
         is a commonplace situation one society that parents  have  to  make
         the difficult choice to put their children today childcare  because
         the financial circumstances dictate that they must return to work."



     30. Mr Iqbal submitted that it is not commonplace in  modern  societies
         to do so and had it been so then it is genuinely hard to think of a
         reason why the sponsor (who had a choice to earn �19,000 per annum)
         would choose on one hand to personally care for her child  so  that
         she is refusing to send him into daily childcare yet, on the  other
         hand, with this very action she is depriving her child's company of
         his father in the UK. As she is  able  to  easily  choose  to  earn
         �19,000 by working full time which would enable her husband to come
         to the UK to be with the sponsor and their  child  she  knows  that
         this could be achieved only if she chose to  start  full-time  work
         which would be open to her. Mr Iqbal posed the question that it was
         remarkable to think why on earth isn't  she  picking  up  full-time
         work and putting a child into daily care when it is "commonplace in
         modern society the parents have to make the difficult choice to put
         their  young  children  today  childcare  because  their  financial
         circumstances dictate that they must return to work? The answer  to
         that question according to Mr Iqbal's submission  is  that  firstly
         because the sponsor's father is able and willing to give  financial
         support so financial circumstances did not dictate her to  take  up
         full-time work and secondly, the sponsor does  not  fall  into  the
         commonplace of the modern society that the judges referred  to  and
         thirdly, in the real world there is no utopia where parents do  not
         have to make difficult decisions for  their  children  or  dystopia
         where parents have to make difficult decisions for their children.

     31. He further submitted that the judge could have taken  into  account
         that when the appellant came to the UK could  take  the  employment
         and therefore respective employment could be taken into account.

     32. He therefore submitted that the FtTJ erred in law  on  a  point  of
         principle by putting objective criteria to a  subjective  question.
         He submitted that there was  no  set  definition  for  "exceptional
         circumstances" and was fact sensitive and that there were no  legal
         authorities available where a definition is given  of  "exceptional
         circumstances". He invited me to set aside the decision.

     33. There was a rule 24 response on behalf of the respondent dated 29th
         of September 2020. In that response it is submitted that the  judge
         directed himself to the law, immigration  rules  and  case  law  at
         length in the determination. In particular, there was no  challenge
         the  fact  that  the  appellant  could  not  meet   the   financial
         requirement of the rules. There was no precedent case law  to  give
         any weight to the submission that a  combination  of  benefits  and
         salary which  meet  the  financial  threshold  should  counter  the
         proportionality assessment/exceptional  circumstances  required  to
         show breach of article 8 outside of the rules. Given the fact  that
         benefits are not  acceptable  evidence  of  meeting  the  financial
         requirements it would be irrational if those same benefits  can  be
         used to circumvent the rules.

     34. The response  submits  that  the  judge  considered  the  sponsor's
         evidence in respect of her employment from paragraph 23 finding  at
         paragraph 25 that the reason given the sponsor's choice not to work
         extra hours, in order to meet the rules was not an exceptional one.
         At [26] the FtTJ found that it was not unreasonable for the  couple
         to arrange their affairs so that they could meet  the  requirements
         of the Immigration Rules and that the delay in reuniting the family
         was down to those choices made by the couple. The judge also  taken
         into account the best interests of the child in making a decision.

     35. The response states that it was not accepted that it was  incumbent
         on the judge to make findings on the diagnosis  of  depression  and
         anxiety caused by the failure to meet the  immigration  rules  when
         the judge found that it was the sponsor's choice not to work  extra
         hours in order  to  meet  those  immigration  rules.  Thus  it  was
         inferred that the sponsor is the author of her own anxiety.

     36. In her oral submissions Miss Everett submitted that  there  was  no
         material error of law in the decision and that the grounds  focused
         on a submission  that  the  judge  applied  an  objective  test  to
         exceptional circumstances but routinely judges consider this issue.

     37.  She  submitted   that   clearly   everyone's   circumstances   are
         "exceptional" in the sense that they are "unique" to them and there
         can be  no  exhaustive  list  and  the  rules  cannot  cover  every
         eventuality. However it is a high  threshold.  She  submitted  that
         contrary to the submissions made by Mr Iqbal that the judge  should
         have considered cultural expectations, there was no  evidence  that
         this related to the circumstances of the appellant and the sponsor.

     38. She submitted that whilst the ongoing  separation  may  be  causing
         them distress, this was not an "exceptional circumstance"  and  the
         fact that the sponsor was having to make  difficult  decisions  for
         childcare and work was a matter that the judge was rationally  able
         to make on the evidence. A majority  of  people  have  to  do  this
         regardless of immigration matters and thus it did not  make  it  an
         "exceptional circumstance".

     39. As to the medical evidence but did not go so  far  as  meeting  any
         test for "exceptional circumstances".

     40. Miss Everett accepted that the test applicable will  be  subjective
         to a degree but that the judge took into account that  what  people
         have  to  do  routinely  would  not   constitute   an   exceptional
         circumstance and that just because people have cogent  reasons  for
         example wanting to care full time, does not make  it   "exceptional
         "to meet the rules. The  rules  are  proportionate  and  whilst  Ms
         Everett submitted that she understood the  sponsor's  reasons,  the
         rules did not accommodate  them,  and  it  did  not  amount  to  an
         "exceptional circumstance" and thus the  judge  did  not  misdirect
         himself.

     41. At  the  conclusion  of  the  submissions,  I  discussed  with  the
         advocates the submission made by Mr  Iqbal  where  he  stated  that
         there  was  no  authority  or  any   definition   of   "exceptional
         circumstances" available. In this context I referred the  advocates
         to the respondent's guidance available on this issue.

     42. Miss Everett accepted that neither Advocate had referred the  judge
         to the guidance and that the guidance had not been raised. Mr Iqbal
         confirmed that the guidance had not been before the judge and  that
         he had not addressed it in the  skeleton  argument  and  that  this
         could rank as a "Robinson obvious" point and that the  judge  would
         have to consider relevant factors.

     43. Neither Advocate had  considered  the  issue  of  the  guidance  or
         whether it was material to the decision. Having taken  instructions
         from the sponsor,  Mr  Iqbal  submitted  that  he  would  like  the
         opportunity to consider the guidance and to seek  to  persuade  the
         court that this was a material issue.

     44. I therefore adjourned the hearing for the advocates  so  that  they
         could put before the tribunal any further submissions  that  either
         party wish to make.

     45. The hearing reconvened on 6 January 2021. No further documents were
         provided on behalf of the respondent.

     46. Mr Iqbal provided a skeleton argument which he relied upon for  the
         purposes of the hearing. He also provided two additional  documents
         which was fresh evidence and  accepted  that  this  would  only  be
         relevant in the event of  the  Upper  Tribunal  setting  aside  the
         decision and re-making the decision. He submitted that  the  policy
         set out a number of factors which must be taken into account as  to
         whether there were "exceptional circumstances". He  submitted  that
         they were set out in the bullet points  in  the  skeleton  argument
         which addressed the evidence.

     47. Mr Iqbal submitted that  the  points  should  be  given  cumulative
         weight from paragraph 9 onwards including the best interests of the
         child. He submitted that there was an obligation  on  the  FtTJ  to
         look at  the  factors  and  those  which  were  in  favour  of  the
         appellant. He submitted this was lacking in the decision  and  thus
         there was a material error of law.

     48. The factors set out and identified by Mr Iqbal were as follows.

             . Ability to lawfully remain in or enter another  country.  The
               appellant is an Egyptian national and his wife and child  are
               British citizens. Whilst  the  sponsor  has  lived  with  the
               appellant in Egypt when she moved there in September 2013 the
               cohabitation lasted for  less  than  two  years  because  the
               sponsor felt intimidated, scared, and  isolated  because  she
               lived in the UK forever 21 years. She was unable  to  lead  a
               normal life and carry out simple day-to-day tasks due to  the
               language barrier (paragraph 17 - 19).

             . The nature and extent of the family  relationships  involved.
               This is a genuine subsisting marriage and  thus  the  element
               was not an issue.

             . The likely impact on the applicant, their partner  and  child
               of the application is refused.  The  sponsor  and  the  child
               cannot live in Egypt permanently. The natural impact  of  the
               refusal to grant entry clearance is that the  relevant  child
               would be unable to spend time with his  father,  the  sponsor
               will be unable to spend time with her husband and overall the
               family unit would not be able live  together  like  a  normal
               family.

             . Serious cultural barriers to  relocation  overseas.  Egyptian
               national  language  and  heritage  traditions  and  festivals
               patriarchal, familial  uniqueness  food  et  cetera  are  all
               unknown to the sponsor and indeed to the  child  who  was  in
               full-time education in the UK.

             . The impact of mental or physical disability or of  a  serious
               illness  which  requires  ongoing  medical   treatment.   The
               appellant's witness statement  (paragraphs  27-28)  that  the
               appeal and separation from him  led  to  her  suffering  with
               depression and anxiety.

             . The absence of governance or security  and  of  the  country.
               Skeleton argument refers to the witness statement and country
               guidance.

             . The immigration status of the applicant. The applicant  is  a
               national of Egypt.

             . Lack of knowledge of language spoken in the country in  which
               the family will be required to continue or resume living. The
               sponsor and child do not speak Arabic. The child is in  full-
               time education in England.

             . Being separated from extended family members.  The  sponsor's
               sibling and mother reside in the United Kingdom.  Her  father
               resides in the USA the sponsor and child have a close bond.

             . A material change in the quality of life and  family  in  the
               country in which they will be required to continue or  resume
               living. Reference is made to seeing the witness statements of
               the appellant and the sponsor.

             . The appellant and their partner have a child in the  UK  with
               serious mental health or learning difficulties. This  is  not
               applicable.

             . the applicant's  partners  are  genuine  subsisting  parental
               relationship with the child in the UK. This is not an issue.

     49. Factors relevant to the best interests of the child:

             . whether the parent or parents are expected to remain  outside
               or to leave the UK. Here the child lives with the sponsor and
               the United Kingdom,  he  attends  school,  both  are  British
               citizens and as such are not expected to leave the UK.

             . The age of the child at the  date  of  the  application;  two
               years and eight months

             . the child's nationality, with  particular  importance  to  be
               accorded to British citizenship where the child has this. The
               mother and child are British citizens.

             . The child's current country residence and length of residence
               there. The child was born May 2016 in Saudi Arabia and  moved
               to the UK three months later and has lived in the UK since.

             . Family circumstances in which a child  is  living;  child  is
               living with his mother and attends school  and  has  a  close
               bond with the appellant. The child visited the  appellant  in
               Egypt in 2018 for two weeks and otherwise is in contact  with
               the appellant through  modern  means  of  communication.  The
               child started foundation stage in September 2020.

             . The extent to which the  decision  will  interfere  with,  or
               impact on child's family or private life. The child  will  be
               unable to live with both his parents under the same  roof  in
               the United Kingdom.

     50. Mr Iqbal submitted that  the  cumulative  effect  of  the  relevant
         factors was such that the refusal to grant entry clearance amounted
         to  "unjustifiable  harsh  consequences"  for  the  appellant,  the
         sponsor, and the child. He therefore submitted  that  there  was  a
         material error of law in the decision and that the appeal should be
         allowed.

     51. Ms Everett on behalf of the respondent submitted that as identified
         at the previous hearing there was  no  reference  to  the  guidance
         however notwithstanding the submissions that were made on behalf of
         the appellant in the skeleton argument, none of them  dislodge  the
         relevant finding made by the FtTJ when dealing with the issues.

     52. Miss Everett submitted that most people  have  cogent  reasons  for
         wanting a particular outcome and Mr Iqbal had not demonstrated with
         the guidance that the outcome before the FtTJ although not desired,
         would be unjustifiably harsh. The judge had noted that  the  remedy
         was open to the appellant and that he had taken  the  view  on  the
         evidence that the sponsor could earn sufficient money to reach  the
         threshold and therefore whilst there was no detailed  reference  to
         the guidance the judge's findings offset  this  and  therefore  the
         decision should stand.

Decision on error of law:

     53. There is no dispute about the legal framework to this appeal. As
         the FtTJ set out in his decision, in light of the Supreme Court
         judgement in MM (Lebanon) and others v SSHD [2017] UKSC 10, the
         financial requirements set out in Appendix FM have changed. Whilst
         the Supreme Court held that the minimum income threshold itself was
         lawful, the court also found that the rules and policies used by
         the Home Office to assess such cases would need to be amended to
         take account of the impact on children and other possible sources
         of income and support. The decision of the Supreme Court led the
         Home Office to amend its guidance. Thus the general requirements
         have been amended to require the decision-maker to consider whether
         the minimum income rule can be met from other sources of income,
         financial support or funds as set out in Paragraph 21A of Appendix
         FM-SE. this includes third-party support where there is a credible
         guarantee of sustainable financial support, prospective earnings of
         the applicant from the sustainable employment or self-employment or
         any other credible and reliable sources of income or funds which is
         available to the couple at the date of the application or will come
         available to them during the period of limited leave applied for.
         This includes cash savings which have been held for less than six
         months and funds for mortgaging a property.


     54. Notwithstanding the argument made, payments from Universal credit
         cannot be taken into account when considering whether an applicant
         meets the minimum income threshold ( see Para 4.2.1 ID) (see
         Paragraph 6 of the IR which defines benefits considered as public
         funds for the purposes of the immigration rules and it includes
         universal credit).


     55. Paragraph 21A of Appendix FM-SE also sets out objective criteria to
         which the decision-maker must have regard in assessing genuineness,
         credibility, and reliability of the sources of income, financial
         support, or funds.


     56. In circumstances where there are "exceptional circumstances" which
         would render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or
         remain, a breach of Article 8 of the ECHR because such refusal
         would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant,
         their partner, or relevant child or another family member whose
         Article 8 rights is evident from the information will be affected
         by decision to refuse the application, the rules require the
         applicant "will generally be granted" appropriately.


     57. Thus the changes to the Rules now state that other sources of
         income can be relied upon in" exceptional circumstances" as set out
         in paragraph GEN 3.1 (1) of Appendix FM. This applies where:



             . the minimum income requirement applies, and it is not met
               from the specified sources; and
             . it is evident from the information provided by the applicant
               that there are exceptional circumstances which could render
               refusal of the application a breach of Article 8 because it
               could result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the
               applicant, their partner, or a relevant child.

     58. As set out at paragraph [19] of the FtTJ's decision and in the oral
         submissions of Mr Iqbal, the parties were in agreement that the
         evidence as to third-party support was satisfactory and thus the
         question was whether there were "exceptional circumstances" in the
         case such that the appellant was able to rely upon this third-party
         support.


     59. The grounds and the oral submissions made by Mr Iqbal seek to
         challenge the FtTJ's consideration of whether there were such
         "exceptional circumstances."

     60. Mr Iqbal submits the test is a subjective one and that "no size
         fits all" and thus the judge was wrong to apply the test in an
         objective way as he did at paragraph 25.

     61. I have given careful consideration to that submission however I do
         not accept that the FtTJ applied the wrong test to the question of
         whether there were "exceptional circumstances" in the way that Mr
         Iqbal has submitted. At [25] the FtTJ set out his conclusion upon
         the issue of "exceptional circumstances" as relied upon by the
         sponsor and the appellant. As set out in the skeleton argument at
         paragraph 5, the "exceptional circumstances" that was relied upon
         for the hearing was that the sponsor did not want to work full time
         due to the impact on her son and that she did not want to have to
         rely on childcare on a full-time basis.

     62. The FtTJ had set out his findings of fact earlier at paragraphs
         [21] - [24]. In doing so the FtTJ accepted "without hesitation"
         that it would be in the best interests of the child concerned to
         live with both parents. The judge went on to state "were in the
         case that there was no prospect of the appellant's sponsor being
         able to earn enough to meet financial requirements of Appendix FM,
         such that the separation of this family was likely to be very
         lengthy or even indefinite, I would likely accept that this
         amounted to an exceptional circumstance. However, I cannot find
         that this is the case."

     63. The FtTJ then set out the appellant's salary at [22] and at [23]
         referred to the sponsor's oral evidence which was that if she had
         worked full-time she would have a salary of �19,000, which was in
         excess of the minimum income requirement. The oral evidence of the
         sponsor set out at [23] was that she had forgone the opportunity of
         promotion where she would have obtained a salary of �22,000 because
         of childcare issues. The FtTJ had the opportunity of considering
         the evidence advanced before him and made the following finding at
         [23]:

             "It is quite clear that it would be easy for the sponsor to
             obtain the employment needed to satisfy the requirements of
             the rules, and it has simply been a matter of choice that she
             has not yet done so.

     64.  At [24] the FtTJ set out the further evidence of the sponsor and
         her confirmation that she had chosen not to increase her hours
         because she did not want to put her son into full-time childcare
         and cited from the written evidence at paragraphs 8 - 10 of her
         witness statement.


     65. This led to the FtTJ's analysis at [25]-[26] as follows:


             "25. While I fully understand and respect SR's wish to provide
             direct care to her young son, I cannot find the choice that
             she faces is an exceptional one. It is a commonplace situation
             in modern society that parents have to make the difficult
             choice to put their young children into daily childcare
             because their financial circumstances dictate that they must
             return to work. I have not been provided with any evidence to
             suggest that the appellant's son has suffered any specific
             detriment during the three days a week that he is already
             spending on nursery, between 8:45 AM and 3 PM. Moreover, he
             will soon turn four years of age and so will be expected to
             start full-time education in September 2020."


             26. I do not find that it is unreasonable to expect SR to work
             longer hours, which are apparently already available to her,
             so as to be able to sponsor an application for entry clearance
             without reliance on third-party support. Indeed, she could
             already have done this long ago before now and the delay in
             reuniting this family is largely down to the choices that had
             been made by the appellant and his wife, rather than because
             of the ECO's decision. It is, I find, reasonable and
             proportionate to expect this couple to arrange their affairs
             such that they can meet the immigration rules, and then to
             make a fresh application for entry clearance.


             27. Taking all matters in the round, treating as I must the
             interests of his son as a primary consideration, I do not find
             that the appellant to satisfy me on the balance of
             possibilities there are exceptional circumstances (meaning
             unjustifiably harsh consequences) on the facts of his case
             such that GEN 3.1 applies. He is not, therefore, entitled to
             rely on the third-party support from his father-in-law in his
             attempt to meet the immigration rules."


     66. In those paragraphs the judge conducted an analysis of whether the
         evidence given by the sponsor concerning her reasons for not
         working amounted to "exceptional circumstances". I consider that
         the submission made by Miss Everett is correct that the judge
         properly took into account the sponsor's evidence and that it was
         rationally open to the judge to conclude that the choice the
         sponsor was facing was not "exceptional" and that many parents have
         to make the difficult choice to put their children into daily
         childcare because their financial circumstances dictate they must
         return to work and that it was not unreasonable to expect her to do
         so.


     67. Whilst Mr Iqbal referred to different circumstances which might
         give rise to "a set of circumstances", such as the position of care
         homes to demonstrate what might be a "cultural norm", as Miss
         Everett pointed out on the facts of this particular case, such
         cultural considerations did not apply nor were they advanced on
         behalf of the appellant and the sponsor.


     68. It is also not the case that the judge failed to take into account
         the circumstances of the appellant's child in this context. At [25]
         the judge expressly considered the evidence before the tribunal and
         stated, "I have not been provided with any evidence to suggest that
         the appellant's son has suffered any specific detriment during the
         three days a week he is spending at nursery..". Thus the submission
         set out in the skeleton argument (and also in the grounds of
         challenge), that the appellant had not wished to work full-time
         because of the effect upon her child was not supported by the
         evidence before the FtTJ.

     69. Whilst the judge made reference to the appellant's son soon
         attaining the age of four and therefore would be starting full-time
         education in September 2020, I do not consider that to be a
         material error as the grounds assert. Whilst the judge was required
         to consider the circumstances at the date of the hearing, the
         observation made was to support his earlier finding that on the
         current evidence that had been no detrimental effect upon the
         sponsor's child and also that it supported his overall finding that
         it would not be unreasonable for the appellant to make that choice.

     70. When considering the decision of the FtTJ it is plain that he gave
         careful consideration to the "exceptional circumstances" that were
         advanced on behalf of the appellant and sponsor. He was mindful of
         the ongoing separation between the family members in the UK and the
         appellant but the FtTJ's decision that the sponsor was having to
         make a difficult decision,  was a decision that many people had to
         face regardless of whether it was in an immigration context, was
         one that was rationally open to the judge to make on the evidence
         that was before him.

     71. I note that the skeleton argument provided at the hearing by
         counsel (paragraph 5) and as argued before the FTT firmly
         identified this as the "exceptional circumstances" relied upon.
         Therefore whilst the grounds refer to other issues such as the
         sponsor's mental health and the issue of the appellant's
         employment, it has not been established that those issues which
         were in fact identified or argued before the judge as "exceptional
         circumstances" either separately or relied upon cumulatively.

     72. Even if they were, the evidence as to the appellant's employment
         consisted of applications made via an online recruitment agency
         (see 53 - 61AB). None of that evidence demonstrated that the
         appellant had been offered terms of employment or for the FtTJ to
         make any assessment of any income he might receive from specific
         employment. The evidence at page 119 (GPs letter) made reference to
         reactive depression suffered by the sponsor but in the light of the
         evidence as to the sponsor's employment, it did not demonstrate
         that her circumstances were such that it affected her ability to
         work. Neither of those points referred to in the grounds of
         challenge undermine the conclusions the FtTJ reached.


     73. I now deal with a further point. At the error of law hearing, Mr
         Iqbal had made a submission that there was no definition of
         "exceptional circumstances" in the context of this appeal. I
         indicated to him that in fact there was guidance to caseworkers on
         this issue. He was not aware of that guidance nor did he have a
         copy of it. Neither advocate before the FtTJ had made any reference
         to it. Therefore I gave Mr Iqbal the opportunity to make
         submissions on this point at the adjourned hearing. For the
         purposes of that hearing, he prepared written submissions which I
         have summarised earlier in this decision. In essence he submits
         that the decision of the FtTJ made no reference to the guidance and
         whilst neither advocate has referred to this, it was "Robinson
         obvious". He then listed the factors set out in the guidance
         referring to the appellant and the sponsor's position. Mr Iqbal
         concludes his submissions by stating that by the cumulative effect
         of those factors show that the refusal to grant entry clearance
         amounted to "exceptional circumstances" or "unjustifiably harsh
         consequences" and therefore the appeal should be allowed.


     74. Whilst Mr Iqbal submits that the points not taken about the
         guidance were "Robinson obvious", if that was so it is surprising
         that not only did the advocates failed to refer to it but also that
         the author of the grounds of appeal made no reference to them.

     75. Mr Iqbal did not seek to argue the context of "Robinson obvious" by
         reference to any case law. However in general terms an appellant
         who does not raise an issue as a specific ground of appeal to the
         tribunal bears a heavy burden in seeking to persuade the court that
         the tribunal erred in law in failing to take or determine that
         issue. The appellant must satisfy the court that the tribunal has
         failed to take or determine a point which is obvious in the sense
         that it must be one "which has a strong prospect of success if it
         is argued".

     76. Having considered with care the submissions from both advocates, I
         am led to the conclusion that it is not been demonstrated that the
         judge made any material error of law in his decision.


     77. "Unjustifiably harsh consequences" are defined in the guidance as:
         " ones which involve a harsh outcome(s) for the applicant or their
         family which is not justified by the public interest, including in
         maintaining effective immigration controls, preventing burdens on
         the taxpayer, promoting integration, and protecting the public on
         rights and freedoms of others."


     78. The guidance describes this as a "high threshold" and that it is
         likely to only be "unusual cases" where applicants will be
         permitted to rely on "other credible and reliable sources of
         income" as a result of meeting it.

     79. The factors set out in the guidance to case workers are as follows:-



             . best interest of the child (see section 13.6)
             . ability to lawfully enter or remain in another country.
             . the nature and extent of the family relationships involved.
             . where relevant, the circumstances giving rise to the
               applicant being separated from their partner and/or child in
               the UK.
             . the likely impact on the applicant, their partner and/or
               child of the applications refused.
             . serious cultural barriers to relocation overseas
             . the impact of the mental or physical disability or of a
               serious illness which requires ongoing medical treatment.
             . the absence of governance or security in another country
             . the immigration status of the applicant and their family
               members
             . whether there are any factors which might increase the public
               interest in refusal
             . cumulative factors should be considered.


     80. The guidance also states that it would not be "unjustifiably harsh"
         when considering whether the couple chose to commence their family
         life together whilst living in separate countries, while one of
         them was temporarily in another country, therefore knowing that
         they would have to meet the immigration requirements of one country
         or another in order to live together.


     81. The submissions made by Mr Iqbal in essence make reference to the
         factors set out above and seek to identify evidence relevant to the
         particular factors. However, by carrying out that exercise it does
         not make those factors identified as "exceptional circumstances".
         By way of example, the written submissions refer to the ability to
         lawfully remain in or enter another country (factor (a)). However
         the FtTJ made a finding upon that issue at paragraph [21] and did
         so in the context of his acceptance that the sponsor had a good
         reason to leave Egypt in September 2016. However, he was entitled
         to consider that on the basis that if it were the case that there
         was no prospect of the sponsor being unable to earn enough to meet
         financial requirements such as the separation of the family was
         likely to be very lengthy or even indefinite,  that he would accept
         that it amounted to an exceptional circumstance. However for the
         reasons he went on to give, the FtTJ did not accept that there
         would be such a separation. Therefore whilst he did not have the
         guidance, that was a factor he properly had regard to.


     82. Other factors referred to in the written submissions were those
         which were not in dispute, or had not been argued before the  FtTJ
         relying on any factual evidence, for example, those relating to the
         nature and extent of the family relationships involved (factor
         (b)), the immigration status of the applicant (factor (h), being
         separated from extended family members (k), or whether the
         appellant's partner had a genuine and subsisting parental
         relationship with the child (factor (n)), the age of the child, the
         child's nationality and current country of residence.

     83. Consequently none of the submissions made identify why on the
         particular factual circumstances relied on they would lead to
         "unjustifiably harsh consequences". Furthermore Mr Iqbal has not
         identified what particular factors were supported by reference to
         evidence that was given before the FtTJ and actively relied upon.
         It is for the appellant to identify the particular factual
         circumstances which it is said give rise to "exceptional
         circumstances" or "unjustifiably harsh consequences". As can be
         seen from both the skeleton argument and the decision of the FtTJ,
         the circumstances relied upon before the judge and were explicitly
         advanced before the FtTJ related to the sponsor and her decision
         that she did not wish to work full time.

     84. Even if it can be said that the judge did not take into account the
         appellant's employment as set out in the grounds (a point that I
         have referred to earlier in this decision), when looking at the
         guidance it sets out specific evidence as to prospective earnings.

     85. As to prospective earnings and employment or self-employment of the
         applicant, consideration is given to whether, at the date of the
         application, a specific offer of employment had been made, or a
         clear basis the self-employment exists. In either case such
         employment or self-employment must be expected to commence within
         three months of the applicant's arrival in the UK. Consideration is
         given to whether the applicant has provided verifiable documentary
         evidence of the offer of employment on the basis the self-
         employment and whether the applicant has provided verifiable
         documentary evidence at the date of the application, the person to
         be employed or self-employed is in or has recently been in
         sustained employment or self -employment of the same or similar
         type, or the same or similar level of complexity and at the same or
         a simple similar level of responsibility. Whether the persons
         provide documentary evidence that the person to be employed or self-
         employed is relevant professional, occupational education
         qualifications that they are recognised in the UK.

     86. On the material before the FtTJ there was no evidence of any
         specific offers of employment nor as to any realistic prospect of
         employment. The evidence consisted of applications that were made
         to an online recruitment agency. Whilst the applicant had set out
         his qualifications in his witness statement (paragraph 9) it had
         not been demonstrated from the evidence that there was an offer of
         employment which would have led to the judge reaching the
         conclusion that he would so obtain employment for the threshold to
         be met.

     87. Having reviewed the evidence in the light of the submissions made
         by the advocates, I have reached the conclusion that Miss Everett
         is correct in her submission that notwithstanding the references
         made to the guidance now, those submissions do not dislodge the
         relevant findings made on the points advanced on behalf of the
         appellant and the sponsor at the hearing and that whilst most
         appellant's would have cogent reasons for wanting a particular
         outcome, Mr Iqbal has not demonstrated that within the guidance,
         that the outcome although not the desired outcome, is
         "unjustifiably harsh".

     88. As the FtTJ found, on the particular factual arguments as advanced
         before the tribunal, it was reasonable and proportionate to expect
         the couple to arrange their affairs so that they could meet the
         Immigration Rules.

     89. Whilst it is not necessary to identify any "unique" or any
         "exceptional" factors (see Agyarko at [47], [60]), in my judgement
         the circumstances that relate to the appellant and the sponsor as
         were relied upon before the FtTJ, were properly considered by the
         FtTJ and the decision he reached was one rationally open to him on
         the evidence available before him.

     90. I remind myself that I can only interfere with a decision of the
         First-tier Tribunal if it is has been demonstrated that the FtTJ
         fell into legal error. I further remind myself that the question
         whether the decision contains a material error of law is not
         whether another Judge could have reached the opposite conclusion
         but whether this Judge reached a conclusion by appropriately
         directing himself and assessing the evidence on a rational and
         lawful basis.

     91.  In UT (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2019] EWCA Civ 1095 where Floyd LJ said at [19]:


                 "I start with two preliminary observations about the nature
                 of, and approach to, an appeal to the UT. First, the right
                 of appeal to the UT is "on any point of law arising from a
                 decision made by the [FTT] other than an excluded
                 decision": Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 ("the
                 2007 Act"), section 11(1) and (2). If the UT finds an error
                 of law, the UT may set aside the decision of the FTT and
                 remake the decision: section 12(1) and (2) of the 2007 Act.
                 If there is no error of law in the FTT's decision, the
                 decision will stand. Secondly, although "error of law" is
                 widely defined, it is not the case that the UT is entitled
                 to remake the decision of the FTT simply because it does
                 not agree with it, or because it thinks it can produce a
                 better one. Thus, the reasons given for considering there
                 to be an error of law really matter. Baroness Hale put it
                 in this way in AH (Sudan) v Secretary of State for the Home
                 Department at [30]:
                 "Appellate courts should not rush to find such
                 misdirection's simply because they might have reached a
                 different conclusion on the facts or expressed themselves
                 differently.""

     92. Whilst this might not have been a decision every judge may have
         reached,  for the reasons given above, it has not been demonstrated
         that the decision of the FtTJ involved the making of a material
         error on a point of law and therefore the decision stands.


     93. I note that the sponsor has now provided further evidence that
         would be relevant to an application for entry clearance.
         Consequently, it would be open to the appellant to make a fresh
         application relying upon that evidence. Given that the FtTJ
         expressly found that the third -party support was satisfactory and
         indeed this was accepted on behalf of the respondent, that would
         also be a factor that the appellant would be able to place reliance
         upon in any fresh application to the ECO in addition to any fresh
         evidence available to them.




Notice of Decision:

     94. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve the making
         of a material  error on a point of law and therefore  the  decision
         stands.
