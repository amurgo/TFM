For the Appellant:     Miss S Ferguson (Counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola (Senior HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Bibi, promulgated on 18th October 2018, following a hearing  at  Taylor
    House on 4th October 2018.  In the determination, the  judge  dismissed
    the appeal of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the  Appellant  subsequently
    applied for, and  was  granted,  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Bangladesh, who was born on  26th
    March 1988.  He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated
    6th February 2018, refusing his application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the  UK  (this  being  dated  19th  September  2016),  whilst
    claiming that he had acquired ten years of lawful residence in  the  UK
    under paragraph 276B of HC 395.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The essence of the Appellant's claim is that the  judge  was  wrong  to
    have found that the Appellant did not qualify under paragraphs 276B and
    276ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules, or  under  freestanding  Article  8
    ECHR, and moreover she was wrong to have concluded that  the  Appellant
    did not acquire ten years' continuous lawful residence in the UK.   The
    Appellant claims that on 9th May 2015 he made an application as a  Tier
    2 Skilled Worker Migrant.  This application was refused on 13th October
    2015.  He had a right to apply for administrative review, which he did,
    so that on 26th October 2015 such an application  was  made.   On  13th
    October 2015 the application was refused.  As a result, the Appellant's
    Section 3C leave to remain in the UK was  exhausted  on  13th  November
    2015.  However, he claims that this  is  not  the  end  of  the  matter
    because he then had the right to make an application within 28 days for
    further leave.  The issue in this appeal, accordingly, revolves  around
    this 28 day exercise of the right to apply for a  variation  of  leave,
    which the Appellant claimed that he did do, but which in  the  decision
    of the judge below, appears not to have been given due consideration.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that the Appellant's leave had come to  an  end,  by
    virtue of the Section 3C leave under the Immigration Act 1971, on  13th
    November 2015.  Indeed, eminent Counsel in the form of Ms S. Broadfoot,
    had argued that "the Appellant's leave came to an end on 13th  November
    2015, by which point he  had  accrued  nine  years  and  one  month  of
    continuous lawful residence" only.  As the judge observed, Ms Broadfoot
    argued that this was the case either at  the  time  of  application  or
    subsequently (see paragraph 37  and  40  of  the  Appellant's  skeleton
    argument).  This much was set out verbatim in the judge's determination
    (see paragraph 40).

 5. However, as the judge observed,

         "Ms Broadfoot argued that other parts of the paragraph are  met  in
         that he is not of a bad character, he does  not  fall  for  general
         refusal, and he had not overstayed for a period  of  more  than  28
         days because the earliest decision was not validly served upon him,
         it being wrongly sent to his previous  representatives"  (paragraph
         41).

 6. In light of this, the judge went on to say that, "in view of the above,
    I find that paragraph 276B has not been met as he has not been lawfully
    resident in the UK for ten continuous lawful years" (paragraph 42).

 7. Thereafter, the judge went on  to  consider  other  provisions  in  the
    Immigration Rules (paragraph 42), before concluding that the  Appellant
    had unfortunately been caught up innocently in a fraud, but  "the  fact
    remains that he had not  completed  ten  years'  of  continuous  lawful
    residence, hence my findings in this regard are academic as it  remains
    the case that he is still unable to satisfy the  requirements  of  Rule
    276B(i)(a).  This much was stated by the judge at paragraph 48  of  the
    determination.   The  judge  went  on  to  refuse  the   appeal   under
    freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence as well".

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the judge had  only  referred  to
    Counsel's skeleton argument (at paragraphs 40 and 41) drawing attention
    to what the skeleton argument stated at paragraphs 37 and 40, but  that
    "the judge has not considered (or even, not mentioned in her  judgment)
    the material part of the Appellant's representative Ms  Broadfoot  QC's
    oral submission.  As it was explained that now the  Appellant  has  not
    met paragraph 276B(i)(a), but other parts  of  this  paragraph  clearly
    demonstrated that the Appellant met continuous lawful residence of  ten
    years, i.e. paragraph 276B(v) of the Immigration Rules.  The judge  has
    erred in law by failing to give reason, why  she  did  not  accept  the
    Appellant's continuous lawful residence under paragraph  276B(v).   The
    case of Bhudia also suggests that  the  Appellant  has  met  continuous
    lawful residence of ten years according to  paragraph  276B(v)  of  the
    Immigration Rules (see paragraph 7 of the grounds of application).

 9. On 9th November 2018, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal.
     It was stated that it was arguable that the judge  had  not  correctly
    allowed for the fact that the applications that followed the Section 3C
    exhaustion of the Appellant's  leave  by  extension  of  law,  on  13th
    November 2015, had thereby been extended through further  variation  of
    leave to remain applications.

The Hearing

10. At the  hearing  before  me  on  18th  December  2018,  Miss  Ferguson,
    appearing on behalf of the Appellant, placed strong reliance  upon  her
    grounds of application.  She  submitted  that  the  exhaustion  of  the
    Appellant's Section 3C(v) on 13th November 2015 was not the end of  the
    matter.  This was because the Appellant was entitled to  apply  for  an
    extension of leave to remain.  Accordingly, on 4th December  2015,  the
    Appellant did apply for further leave  (on  Form  FLR(FP)).   This  the
    Appellant did through Universal Solicitors, and in the application  the
    Appellant relied upon his private and family life rights.   He  did  so
    within the 28 day period of grace that was allowed to him.  Mr Kandola,
    the Presenting Officer, helpfully intervened to say that it was not  in
    dispute that this application had indeed been made within  the  28  day
    period which was allowed as a period of grace.

11. Furthermore, Miss Ferguson went on to explain that on 6th December 2015
    thereafter, the Appellant changes legal representatives from  Universal
    Solicitors to SEB Solicitors.  The  new  representatives  then  updated
    their details via the Home Office online address  system  on  the  same
    day, namely, on 6th December 2015.  They also  sent  a  letter  to  the
    Secretary of State on 7th December 2015, on the  next  day,  requesting
    that they also update their records.  Miss Ferguson explained that  the
    Home Office case record sheet in fact does confirm that  the  Secretary
    of State did receive these correspondences and did indeed  also  update
    her records  (as  this  information  is  clearly  demonstrated  in  the
    Secretary of State's disclosure of documents) and can be  plainly  seen
    in the Appellant's bundle at page 56.

12. Thereafter, Miss Ferguson continued,  the  Appellant's  representatives
    sent numerous letters between  6th  December  2015  until  the  end  of
    December 2016, to the Respondent Secretary of State.  These included  a
    letter on 7th December 2015, another letter on  7th  December  2015,  a
    further letter of 22nd December 2015,  an  additional  letter  of  22nd
    January 2016, and then letters on 27th January 2016,  on  2nd  February
    2016, and on 31st March 2016, as well as on  21st  May  2016  and  19th
    September 2016.  In turn, the Respondent Secretary of State  also  sent
    several letters to SEB Solicitors, and these are  dated  11th  December
    2015, 15th December 2015, 27th  January  2016,  and  10th  March  2016.
    These can all be seen in the Respondent's  bundle,  from  page  E67  to
    E138.

13. Before any decision could be made on the application for  extension  of
    leave made  by  the  Appellant  on  4th  December  2015,  however,  SEB
    Solicitors, being the newly instructed solicitors, now made a variation
    of leave application on 21st May 2016.  They  then  attempted  to  vary
    that leave application  once  again  by  another  application  on  19th
    September 2016.  This application to vary was made on SET(LR).

14. However,  to  the  Appellant's  great  surprise,  the  application  was
    rejected as invalid on 6th May 2016, on the basis  that  the  Appellant
    had not submitted his original passport,  despite  the  fact  that  the
    Secretary of State had requested this three times, as maintained by the
    Secretary of State.  The Appellant claims that he did not  receive  any
    such correspondence from the Respondent Secretary of State.

15. The application of 4th December 2015, which was  rejected  on  6th  May
    2016, on the basis of non-compliance with required conditions,  namely,
    the failure to provide the  original  passport,  was  not  sustainable,
    submitted Miss Ferguson.  The passport of  the  Appellant  was  due  to
    expire on 4th  July  2016.   The  correspondence  from  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State in the Respondent's bundle at pages  E109  to  E111,
    shows that the Appellant's solicitor  was  in  communication  with  the
    Respondent in the relevant manner, so  that  it  was  wrong  to  simply
    reject the Appellant, without refusing  it,  and  particularly  as  the
    reason given was that there had been a failure to provide the  required
    fees, which could not be true because the Appellant's bundle shows  (at
    page 93) that on 8th December 2015 fees were sent  out.   In  her  oral
    submission to me, Miss Ferguson explained that there  is  an  entry  of
    �649 leaving the Appellant's bank account on  8th  December  2015,  and
    this would have been the sum paid for by way of a fee to the Respondent
    Secretary of State.

16. However, be that as it may that the Respondent was  proceeding  on  the
    wrong basis by rejecting the  Appellant's  application  on  account  of
    material conditions not being fulfilled such as payment of the fee, the
    fact remained, submitted Miss Ferguson, that the rejection decision was
    not sent by the Secretary of State to SEB Solicitors,  the  Appellant's
    legal representatives.  This  was  despite  the  fact  that  there  was
    communication SEB Solicitors  and  the  Respondent  Home  Office.   The
    Appellant himself was also totally unaware about a decision having been
    made against him by way of rejection of his application.

17. In short, Miss Ferguson submitted,  that  had  these  material  matters
    above been taken fully into account, the judge would have  been  forced
    to take account of the fact that  the  Appellant  made  an  application
    within the 28 day period (which is accepted by Mr Kandola today at  the
    hearing before me) and that the rejection on the  basis  that  material
    conditions had not been complied with, namely, that  the  fee  had  not
    been paid, was unsustainable, given what appeared at  page  93  of  the
    Appellant's bundle, which was that a  fee  of  �649  was  paid  on  8th
    December 2015.  Accordingly, the decision was unsustainable.   By  this
    stage, the Appellant was able to show that he had been in this  country
    for ten years.

18. For his part, Mr Kandola submitted that this matter could be approached
    in two ways.  First, if eminent Counsel on the day of the hearing,  had
    already conceded in her skeleton argument that the Appellant could  not
    satisfy the condition that he had lawfully  been  in  the  UK  for  ten
    years, then that was the end of the matter.  What Ms Broadfoot  QC  had
    stated (see paragraph 40 of the determination) was that  the  Appellant
    had only  accrued  nine  years  and  one  month  of  continuous  lawful
    residence.  This  was  expressly  stated  in  Ms  Broadfoot's  skeleton
    argument (at paragraphs 37 and 40).  Today it was being suggested  that
    Ms Broadfoot had actually  argued  the  matter  on  a  different  basis
    orally, and that such inference could be drawn, because the  judge  had
    neglected to make any reference to the oral submissions simply  stating
    that she had considered the skeleton argument "and all other  evidence"
    (see paragraph 37).  The fact  remained,  submitted  Mr  Kandola,  that
    there was no statement  from  Ms  Broadfoot  QC  to  explain  what  had
    actually transpired at the hearing, and in particular whether  she  had
    orally made submissions to the effect that was  now  being  maintained.
    Second, submitted Mr Kandola, the other way in which this appeal  could
    be considered was on  the  basis  that,  if  there  was  correspondence
    transpiring between SEB Solicitors and the Respondent Home Office, then
    the rejection decision, which was made on 6th  May  2016,  should  have
    been served on the Appellant's existing solicitors.

19. In this regard, Mr Kandola very helpfully went on to  explain  that  he
    did have in his notes an email dated 11th April 2016 from the Appellant
    himself to the Respondent Home Office, enquiring  about  the  rejection
    decision.  In response to that request  the  Home  Office  by  recorded
    delivery (under number KX711930876GB) made an ex gratia refund  of  the
    Appellant's fee, and disclosed the decision against  the  Appellant  of
    6th May 2016.  Mr Kandola helpfully explained that what seems  to  have
    happened here is that there was a trail of correspondence under one CIJ
    number  between  Universal  Solicitors,  which  were  the   Appellant's
    previous solicitors, and the Home  Office;  and  a  separate  trail  of
    correspondence under a separate CIJ number between SEB Solicitors,  the
    Appellant's current solicitors, and the Home Office.  Whilst it was the
    case that this was the same government department, no-one had been able
    to match up the two trails of  correspondence,  so  that  even  though,
    after the  change  of  solicitors  to  SEB  Solicitors,  correspondence
    continued between SEB Solicitors and the Appellant,  the  decision  may
    well have been served at the relevant time upon  Universal  Solicitors,
    rather than upon SEB Solicitors, as should have been the  case,   given
    that the Respondent Secretary of State had updated their  records  with
    the  new  solicitors  on  7th  December  2015,  upon  request  of   the
    Appellant's current solicitors.  This  evidence  can  be  seen  in  the
    Appellant's bundle at page 56.

20. In reply, Miss Ferguson stated that the evening of 11th April 2016  and
    what followed it is actually recorded in the Appellant's bundle at page
    95.  This is even  from  the  Appellant  himself  requesting  that  the
    rejection decision of 6th May 2016 be served upon him.

Error of Law

21. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

22. First, it is plain that the argument before Judge Bibi,  also  included
    an argument that the Appellant had not overstayed "for a period of more
    than 28 days because the earliest decision was not validly served  upon
    him".

23. Second, the argument before Judge Bibi  also  included  the  submission
    that  the  earliest  decision  was  "wrongly  sent  to   his   previous
    representatives" (paragraph 41).  That is the very basis upon which the
    application before this Tribunal has now been put.   It  was  incumbent
    upon the judge to consider the basis upon which  it  was  being  stated
    that the Appellant had not overstayed for a period of more than 28 days
    (a matter that has been  openly  accepted  by  Mr  Kandola  during  the
    hearing before me today), and it was also incumbent upon the  judge  to
    consider the issue that the decision had been wrongly sent to  previous
    representatives, namely, Universal Solicitors.

24. Had this been the case, it would have become plain to the Tribunal that
    there had been a most ghastly mix up in two trails  of  correspondence,
    eventuating from two different CIJ  numbers,  albeit  within  the  same
    legal department, that led to  a  confusion,  whereby  the  Appellant's
    current representatives, SEB  solicitors,  were  not  served  with  the
    rejection decision (which was not a refusal decision).   The  rejection
    decision was on the basis that the Appellant had not complied with  the
    fee requirements.

25. This is difficult to understand,  given  that  by  the  time  that  the
    Appellant himself on 11th April 2016 emailed the  Respondent  Secretary
    of State, what he was sent was an ex gratia refund of  the  fee  (as  I
    understand it), and also sent the unserved decision of  6th  May  2016,
    which she would have been able to challenge, and when challenged  would
    have led to the Appellant being able to show that he could  demonstrate
    ten years of lawful residence in this country.  The suggestion moreover
    that the Appellant had failed to provide his  passport,  despite  three
    requests being made from the Respondent Home Office, is  one  that  the
    Appellant also vehemently contests, alleging that he  did  not  receive
    such a request for information, and that in any event the  passport  in
    question was with the Home Office department in any event.

26. It is plain that these matters need  now  to  be  properly  probed  and
    ventilated with a clear chronology of events, and a cross-reference  to
    the documentary trail, before it can be affirmatively decided that  the
    Appellant succeeds in being able to show that he has got ten  years  of
    lawful residence in this country.

27. The additional argument that he succeeds in any event on the  basis  of
    paragraph 276ADE and paragraph  276B,  is  also  a  matter  that  needs
    considering by  the  Tribunal  again.   The  Appellant  should  not  be
    deprived of the chance to have the matters considered again properly at
    first instance, before there is a right of appeal  from  that  decision
    again to the Upper Tribunal, should that prove necessary.   This  being
    so, the appropriate course of action is for this matter to be  remitted
    back to the First-tier Tribunal again.

Notice of Decision

I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved  the
making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the  decision  below.   I
remake the decision as follows.  This matter is remitted back to the  First-
tier Tribunal to be determined by a judge other than Judge Bibi pursuant  to
Practice Statement 7.2(a).

No anonymity direction is made.

This appeal is allowed to that extent.
