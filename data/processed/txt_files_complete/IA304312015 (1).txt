                            DECISION AND REASONS

BACKGROUND TO THE APPEAL

1.   The Appellant, who was born on  19  January  1980,  is  a  national  of
    Mauritius. On 13 May 2014, he applied for indefinite leave to remain on
    the basis of long residence.  The Respondent refused  this  application
    and also a further one made on the  same  basis  on  2  July  2014.  He
    appealed and his appeal was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Verity
    in a decision promulgated on  20  May  2015,  on  the  basis  that  the
    Respondent had failed to consider her own policy on long residence.  As
    a consequence, the Respondent re-considered his application but made  a
    further decision to refuse his application on 1  September  2015.   She
    also made a supplemental decision on 11  October  2016.  The  Appellant
    appealed and his appeal came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Miller,
    who dismissed the appeal in a decision promulgated on 5 December  2016.



3.   The Appellant appealed and permission to appeal was granted  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Astle on 14 June 2017, on the basis that First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Miller appeared to have failed to  addressed  his  claim
    that he had made an in-time application for further leave to remain  in
    2012 and had  also  failed  to  address  other  issues  raised  in  the
    Appellant's counsel's skeleton argument.

ERROR OF LAW HEARING

6.   I heard  oral  submissions  from  both  counsel  and  the  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer  and  I  have  referred  to  the  content  of  their
    submissions, where relevant, below.

DECISION

7.   The Applicant needed to show that he  had  had  a  ten-year  period  of
    lawful residence  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  order  to  qualify  for
    indefinite leave to remain  under  Paragraph  276  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules states that:

     "(a) "continuous residence" means residence in the UK for  an  unbroken
    period, and for these purposes a period shall not be considered to have
    been broken where an applicant is absent from the UK for a period of  6
    months or less at any one time, provided that the applicant in question
    has existing limited leave to enter or remain upon their departure  and
    return"

8.   It was initially the Respondent's case  that  he  had  two  periods  of
    overstaying which broke the continuity of his leave. In relation to the
    former, the Appellant first entered the United Kingdom in February 2004
    and was here with leave until 25 April 2006. He then overstayed for one
    day before returning to Mauritius on 26 April 2006. He  re-entered  the
    United Kingdom on 26 May 2006 with leave to remain as a  visitor  until
    25 November 2006. Therefore, he did not fall within the requirements of
    paragraph 276B, as he had no leave to remain when he  left  the  United
    Kingdom.

9.   However, the Home Office Guidance for its own staff on  Long  Residence
    Version 13.0, published on 8 May 2015, states that:

     "You can overlook a period  of  unlawful  residence  if  the  applicant
    leaves the UK after their valid leave has expired and:

    - Applies for entry clearance within 28 days  of  their  original  leave
      expiring
    - Returns to the UK with valid leave within 6 months of  their  original
      departure".

10.  The Applicant applied to enter  the  United  Kingdom  and  was  granted
    leave to enter as a visitor just after the permissible  28  day  period
    but the Guidance also states that:

     "When refusing  an  application  on  the  ground  it  was  made  by  an
    applicant who has overstayed by more than 28 days,  you  must  consider
    any  evidence  of  exceptional  circumstances  which   prevented   that
    applicant from applying within the first 28 days of overstaying".

11.  It was the Appellant's case that he had  to  withdraw  his  application
    for further leave and return to Mauritius as his father  had  died  and
    there was evidence before First-tier Tribunal Judge Miller  to  confirm
    the date of the Appellant's father's death. Therefore, at paragraph  21
    of his decision First-tier Tribunal Judge Miller stated that:

      "Having  considered  the  matter,  it  does  seem  to  me   that   the
    circumstances were exceptional, and the length of time that he spent in
    Mauritius was not unreasonable. Accordingly, I find that there  was  no
    interruption in his lawful residence in 2006, such as to interfere with
    his accrual of continuous lawful residence".

12.  However, it is also the Respondent's case that the  Appellant  has  had
    no leave to remain in the United Kingdom since 18 June 2013,  when  his
    application as his wife's dependent was refused. In  response,  counsel
    for the Appellant referred to the order made by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Kebede on 13 February 2014, which noted that the Applicant's  wife  had
    brought a claim for judicial review, which challenged the  decision  by
    the Respondent to refuse to grant them an in-country right of appeal. I
    did not have a copy of this judicial review application and, therefore,
    was not able to assess its relevance.

13.  However, it is  clear  that,  in  the  Appellant's  counsel's  skeleton
    argument for the hearing before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Miller,  it
    was submitted that there was an exceptional  circumstance  which  could
    have attracted further discretion under the Guidance. This was that the
    earlier in-time application for leave made by the Appellant's  wife  on
    30 January 2012 should have attracted an in-country  right  of  appeal.
    Counsel submitted that the reason that  this  application  attracted  a
    right of appeal was that it had erroneously been refused on  the  basis
    that the appropriate application fee had not been paid. Counsel for the
    Appellant referred me to a copy  of  the  Appellant's  bank  statement,
    which showed that there was ï¿½3,370.47 in his bank account at  the  time
    of the application, which would have been more than enough to  pay  for
    the application.

14.  He also relied on  the  case  of  Basnet  (validity  of  application  -
    respondent) Nepal [2012] UKUT 113, where  it  was  held  that  "if  the
    respondent asserts that an application was not accompanied  by  a  fee,
    and so was not valid,  the  Respondent  has  the  onus  of  proof".  He
    submitted that if an in-country appeal had been granted that would have
    attracted Section 3C leave,  which  would  have  lasted  until  he  had
    completed the necessary ten year continuous period of lawful  leave  to
    become entitled to indefinite leave to remain. Without sight of further
    evidence it was not possible to decide whether this was  the  case  but
    the Home Office Presenting Officer accepted that the application on  30
    January 2012 had been refused for non-payment of a fee.

15.  But the issue before me is the failure  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Miller to address this argument in his decision and, in particular,  in
    paragraph 22, and, therefore, a failure to apply part of the policy  on
    indefinite   leave   which   relates   to   evidence   of   exceptional
    circumstances. It was not sufficient for the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    to merely refer in general to the skeleton argument in paragraph 13  of
    the decision.

16.  The Appellant also  relied  on  his  rights  under  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights. The Home Office Presenting Officer
    submitted  that  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Miller  had  given   full
    consideration to the Appellant's private  and  family  life  rights  in
    paragraphs 25 - 27 of his decision. It is correct that in paragraph  26
    of the decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge stated that  he  had  had
    regard to Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
    2009 but he did not remind himself that a child's best interests should
    be a primary consideration or give any detailed consideration to  these
    interests.

17.  Furthermore, in paragraph 28 of the decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge that "there would appear to be little  purpose  in  having  Rules
    enabling a person to acquire permanent residence if the same were to be
    granted when the Rules are not met". Ihis statement fails to take  into
    account the Guidance provided by  the  Respondent  and  undermines  any
    proportionality decision in relation to the Appellant's entitlement  to
    leave to remain outside the Immigration Rules.

DECISION


(1)  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.

(2)  The decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge Miller is  set  aside,  apart
    from his findings in paragraph  21  of  the  decision,  which  was  not
    challenged by the Respondent.

(3)  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard  de  novo
    before a First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Miller.


DIRECTIONS

1.   It is directed that the Appellant do disclose a copy of the claim  form
    for JR/3160/2013 and any documents attached to it; along with a copy of
    the Respondent's acknowledgment  of  service  and  summary  grounds  of
    defence to the Home Office Presenting Officer's Unit and the First-tier
    Tribunal sitting at Taylor House within 14 days of notice  being  given
    of the de novo hearing.
