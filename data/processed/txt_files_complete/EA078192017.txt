For the Appellant:     none
For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal James (the judge), promulgated on  15  November  2017,  in
        which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  respondent's
        decision dated 29 July 2017 refusing to issue  her  a  registration
        certificate as confirmation of her right to reside in the UK  as  a
        qualified person under the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
        Regulations 2016.


     2. The appellant is a national of Hungary, date of  birth  11  January
        1975. She maintains that she has lived and worked in the  UK  since
        2006 and is married to a British citizen. She  maintains  that  she
        made an application for a 'residency card' on 21 April 2017. A copy
        of this application has  not  been  provided.  It  is  not  however
        disputed that an application for a document confirming her right of
        residence as a qualified  person  was  made.  What  is  unclear  is
        whether this was an application for a document confirming  a  right
        of permanent residence, or only seeking confirming of  a  right  of
        residence as a Qualified Person.


     3. The application was refused on the basis that the appellant  failed
        to provide evidence that she was a Qualified Person. The  appellant
        lodged an appeal against this decision  but  elected  to  have  the
        appeal determined on the papers without an oral hearing. The  judge
        noted the assertion in the Notice of Appeal that the appellant  was
        attaching invoices and bank account statements, but that there  was
        no such documentation before him. The judge noted that  there  were
        no  bundles  of  documents  from  either  the  appellant   or   the
        respondent. On the basis that there was no evidence before  him  to
        support the appellant's appeal, the judge dismissed the appeal.

     4. In granting permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  Judge  of
        the First-tier Tribunal C A Parker noted that a bank statement  and
        invoices were in fact attached to the appeal notice.

     5. At the 'error of law' hearing I confirmed with Mr  Bramble,  having
        carefully considered the  appellant's  appeal  form,  that  it  did
        contain a Barclay's Bank statement in the appellant's name covering
        the period 25 January 2017 to 10 March 2017 and indicating deposits
        from several dental practices. Also  attached  was  an  invoice  in
        respect of the appellant's self-employment as  a  freelance  dental
        nurse. The documents were attached to a general bundle date stamped
        by the Arnhem Support Centre on 8 August 2017, and which  indicated
        that  it  contained  enclosures  consisting  of  2  pages  of  bank
        statements and 3 pages of invoices.


     6. It is unclear to me why the judge was not aware of these documents.
        It may  be  that,  through  administrative  delay,  they  were  not
        actually attached to  the  tribunal  until  after  the  appeal  was
        considered by the judge. I note that the  appellant  wrote  to  the
        Home Office on 5 October 2017 indicating that she  had  changed  to
        her married name and  that  she  had  also  informed  the  Tribunal
        Services of this change. It may be  that,  due  to  the  change  of
        names, the relevant documentation was not attached to the file.  Be
        that as it may, it is apparent that  the  judge  did  not  consider
        material evidence when he made his decision. Although the judge may
        well be entirely blameless for  this,  there  has  clearly  been  a
        procedural impropriety sufficient to render  the  judge's  decision
        unsafe.


     7. Having identified a material error of law I set  aside  the  First-
        tier Tribunal's decision and proceed to remake the decision.


     8. I granted permission to the appellant to adduce further documentary
        evidence. She produced a number of further invoices covering  March
        and April 2017 in respect of her  self-employment  as  a  freelance
        dental  nurse.  She  additionally  provided  an  extract  from  the
        Hungarian Register of Marriages confirming her marriage to  Anthony
        Sidney Wilkin, and a council tax bill dated 8 March 2017  addressed
        to both the appellant and Mr  Wilkin.  The  appellant  additionally
        produced a letter from HMRC dated 31 May 2017 confirming  that  she
        was registered as a Self Employed  Dental  Nurse  from  20  October
        2016. Also provided was a further bank account document relating to
        the appellant and indicating further deposits into her bank account
        from several dental practices between 10 March 2017  and  30  April
        2017.  Finally,  the  appellant  provided  a  Self  Assessment  Tax
        Calculation for 2016-17, dated 2 November 2017, indicating that her
        total income received was 19, 872 for the tax year ending  5  April
        2017.


     9. In oral evidence the appellant confirmed that  she  was  no  longer
        self-employed but worked,  from  October  2017,  for  an  insurance
        company in Hayward Heath as a Portfolio Manager.  She  additionally
        confirmed that she had been employed in the UK since her arrival in
        2006 and indicated that  she  could  provide  documentary  evidence
        after the hearing. I indicated to both parties that I was  prepared
        to receive further evidence before writing my decision. I indicated
        that I would allow the  appeal  but  that  I  would  wait  until  I
        received the further evidence before promulgating my decision.


    10. After  the  hearing  I  received  a  number  of  P60  End  of  Tear
        Certificates relating to the appellant for the tax years  ending  5
        April 2016, 5 April 2015, 5 April 2014 and  5  April  2012.  I  was
        additionally provided with a    HMRC Tax Calculation for  the  year
        2012-13 relating to a tax repayment for the year to 5  April  2013,
        which indicated that, for the tax year 2012-13 the appellant had  a
        PAYE income of ï¿½24,884. I  was  also  provided  with  further  HMRC
        commence relating to the appellant's income for the tax years 2008-
        9, 2007-8, 2006-7. I  was  also  provided  with  a  Barclay's  bank
        account in the appellant's married name  confirming  wage  deposits
        from the Markerstudy Group covering the period 23 June 2017  to  23
        March 2018, and  a  contract  of  employment  in  relation  to  the
        appellant issued by the Markerstudy Group.


    11. Mr Bramble provided a written  response  to  the  further  evidence
        indicating  the  respondent's  satisfaction  that  the  appellant's
        evidence showed she is  exercising  treaty  rights  and  meets  the
        requirements of regulation 6 of the Immigration (European  Economic
        Area) Regulations 2016, and that  she  therefore  qualifies  for  a
        registration certificate. Mr Bramble  was  additionally  satisfied,
        having regard to the further evidence provided  by  the  appellant,
        that she was a "qualified person" for the period 5 April 2013 to  5
        April 2016, and that, based on a combination of bank  transactions,
        a contract of employment and payslips, that the appellant was  also
        a qualified person for the  period  June  2017  to  4  April  2018.
        Although expressing some concern in respect of the period  6  April
        2016 to 31 May 2017, Mr Bramble indicated that this may not  be  an
        issue as this  period  was  covered  by  the  documentary  evidence
        considered at the hearing. The documentary evidence  identified  in
        paragraph 8 supra does indeed confirm  the  appellant's  employment
        for most of the period April 2016 to the end of May  2017.  In  the
        circumstances I am satisfied that the appellant has been exercising
        her Treaty rights for a period of 5 continuous years and  that  she
        has achieved permanent residence.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. I remake the  decision
allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  (European   Economic   Area)
Regulations 2016.
