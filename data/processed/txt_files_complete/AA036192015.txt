Representation:
For the Appellant:     No one
For the Respondent:    Mr Kotas, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Gambia born on 11th  November  1979.   He
    appealed the Respondent's decision of 18th December 2006 to remove  him
    as an illegal entrant from the United  Kingdom  by  way  of  directions
    under paragraphs 8 to 10 of Schedule 2 of  the  Immigration  Act  1971.
    His appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Cheales  on
    23rd April 2015.  The appeal was dismissed in a decision promulgated on
    13th May 2015.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was lodged and was  refused  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes  on  8th  June  2015.   Permission  to
    appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce on 10th  August
    2015.  The permission states that the Appellant's contention is that he
    is stateless.  He states that he would not be granted Southern Sudanese
    nationality and he  states  that  he  attended  the  Southern  Sudanese
    embassy in London which refused  to  recognise  his  nationality.   The
    permission quotes paragraph  42  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision which states "I believe that he would be accepted on return to
    South Sudan and is not stateless."  The permission states that this has
    been put into the decision without reference to  any  of  the  evidence
    produced by the Appellant.  The permission goes on  to  deal  with  the
    Appellant's child in the United Kingdom and refers to the point made by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Holmes, that if the  child  and  the  child's
    mother are  facing  removal  to  Gambia,  in  those  circumstances  the
    Appellant could pursue contact with his son in that country.

The Hearing

 3. The Appellant attended the hearing without a representative.   He  told
    me that he understands that this is an error of law hearing.

 4. He submitted that the judge did not take into account what  was  before
    him and that at the First-tier hearing he had told the Tribunal he  had
    spoken to the Embassies of South Sudan and Gambia  and  they  had  both
    said they would not grant him nationality.

 5. I put to him that he had a previous asylum hearing in February 2007  in
    which he was found not to be credible and  it  was  found  that  he  is
    Sudanese.  He said this was before Sudan was split into  two  different
    states.

 6. I asked him if he has letters from the embassies stating that they will
    not accept him as a national but he has not.  He said when he  went  to
    the South Sudanese Embassy he was told that because he had no  ID  card
    there was no proof that he was from South Sudan, so he was not  granted
    nationality.  He said he made an application while  he  was  there  but
    again he had nothing in writing to show the Tribunal. There was clearly
    no documentary evidence about these issues before the judge,  only  the
    Appellant's word.

 7. The Presenting Officer made his submissions referring to the case of KF
    (Iran)  [2005]  UKIAT  00109  on  statelessness.   He  submitted   that
    permission was granted in Mr Duru's case because it was found that  the
    First-tier Judge had failed to make findings on a material  fact.   The
    Presenting Officer submitted that this Appellant is not  stateless  and
    that is a fact.  In 2007 it was found that he is from Sudan and in 2014
    it was again found that he is from Sudan.

 8. He submitted that the  Appellant  states  that  he  applied  for  South
    Sudanese citizenship but there is no evidence of this  apart  from  his
    oral evidence.

 9. I was referred to the 2007 determination  in  which  the  Appellant  is
    found not to be credible and the 2014 decision in  which  he  is  again
    found not to be credible. He referred me to paragraph 42  of  the  2014
    decision which is quoted in the permission.  He submitted that all  the
    judge states is that he believes the Appellant  is  not  stateless  and
    would be accepted on return  to  Southern  Sudan.   The  Appellant  now
    states that  he  will  not  be  accepted  in  Southern  Sudan  but  the
    Presenting Officer submitted that the judge has given adequate  reasons
    for finding that the Appellant is not stateless  and  can  be  returned
    there.

10. The Presenting Officer submitted that the credibility findings are very
    strong.  Even the expert, Mr Verney, makes it clear that the  Appellant
    has not been honest about where he has been living.   I  was  asked  to
    consider the expert report at paragraphs 85 to 93.  I was  referred  to
    the said case of KF about statelessness.  This states  that  a  finding
    that someone is stateless does not, of itself, determine whether he  is
    a refugee.  At paragraph 20 of that case the judge states:
         "It is not always surprising that less than vigorous endeavours may
         be made by asylum applicants to obtain proof of nationality.  Their
         endeavours to obtain nationality documents might prove  successful.
         But to fail to assert the relevant nationality and  the  basis  for
         it, to fail to seek the right documents, or to follow up a  refusal
         with letters, or to seek  further  assistance,  legal  or  NGO,  in
         pursuing the claim  or  to  produce  to  the  asserted  country  of
         nationality those documents which are obtainable is  to  fall  well
         below the minimum necessary for any claim of statelessness."

    This paragraph refers to an Appellant who  has  not  been  deprived  of
    citizenship but  claims  that  his  country  of  nationality  will  not
    recognise him and makes it clear this is  a  very  difficult  basis  on
    which to prove statelessness.  The Presenting  Officer  submitted  that
    that is the case here.  This Appellant has not shown, even to  the  low
    standard of proof in asylum cases, that he is stateless and he has  not
    shown that he is a refugee.

11. The Presenting Officer submitted that when the Appellant  came  to  the
    United Kingdom, South Sudan was not in existence and did not come  into
    existence until 2012.  Since then he has made a  fresh  claim,  stating
    that he will not be accepted into his country of  nationality.   I  was
    asked to give considerable weight to the credibility  findings  in  the
    2014 First-tier decision.  The Presenting Officer submitted  that  this
    man has a nationality and there is no material  error  of  law  in  the
    First-tier Judge's determination.

12. I spoke to the Appellant who stated that the expert, Mr Verney, is  not
    from Sudan.  He said that because of this Mr Verney had asked  him  the
    wrong questions.  He said he was brought up in Darfur since he  was  12
    years old but was born in The Gambia.  He said he  has  never  been  to
    South Sudan and has no one there.   He  said  he  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom from Darfur and the Home Office is trying to return  him  to  a
    country where he has never been and has no right to be a  citizen.   He
    submitted that as he has no evidence to prove citizenship, the  Embassy
    has told him that he will not be granted citizenship.  He said he  made
    an application to the Embassy and got a tracking number but the  First-
    tier Judge in 2014 did not consider this.  He submitted that the  judge
    did not consider all of the evidence which was before him. He submitted
    that that is clear, because he did not comment on it in  his  decision.
    He submitted that this is an error of law.

13. The Appellant then submitted that his  ex-partner  lives  in  Liverpool
    with his son and he has access  to  his  son  and  will  be  unable  to
    exercise this access if he is removed from the United Kingdom.

14. The Presenting Officer submitted that if I find there to be an error in
    the First-tier Judge's decision there are still the credibility  issues
    to take into account and the Appellant should not  be  able  to  profit
    from lies.  He submitted that because of these credibility  issues  the
    judge reached the only conclusion which he could have reached.

15. The Appellant submitted that  he  cannot  afford  a  solicitor  and  is
    telling the truth.  He said he came to the United Kingdom in  2006  and
    claimed asylum when  he  arrived  in  Leeds.   He  submitted  that  the
    Secretary of State has not told him what he can do to convince her that
    he is telling the truth.

16. I asked the Appellant if he pays money to his  child's  mother  and  he
    said he was paying ï¿½50 a month but his ex-partner  said  that  was  not
    enough so he is not paying anything now.  He said he has a court  order
    allowing him to see his child.

17. I pointed out that his ex-partner and the child may have to go  to  The
    Gambia as she has no right to be in the United Kingdom.  I pointed  out
    to him that if he goes to South Sudan he can visit  his  child  in  The
    Gambia.  He said he cannot get citizenship in South Sudan.

Decision and Reasons

18. At paragraph 6 of the 2014 First-tier decision reference is made to the
    refusal letter, dated 18 December 2006, which states that the Appellant
    has admitted that he is a black Sudanese person from  the  Dinka  tribe
    and he can relocate and live amongst his own tribe in South Sudan.  The
    first-tier judge correctly refers to the determination  promulgated  in
    February 2007 in which it was accepted that the appellant is a Sudanese
    national of the Dinka tribe and he lived in the Darfur region of  Sudan
    from 1991 until he came to the United Kingdom.

19. In the 2014 First-tier decision the expert report by  Peter  Verney  is
    referred to.  The judge gives weight to Mr Verney's report.  Mr  Verney
    clearly finds there to be serious credibility issues in the appellant's
    account.

20. The First-tier Judge then refers to  the  2007  determination  and  the
    adverse credibility findings therein.  At paragraph 35 the judge states
    that not only does the judge in 2007 find the  Appellant's  credibility
    to be damaged, so does the expert,  Mr  Verney,  who  states  that  the
    Appellant has not been honest about  where  he  has  been  living.   At
    paragraph 42, because of a lack of  credibility  the  First-tier  judge
    clearly finds that the Appellant is not  stateless  and  he  has  given
    proper reasons for this finding.

21. The appellant's oral evidence that he has been rejected by 2  Embassies
    for citizenship has not been supported by any documentary evidence.

22. The credibility issues have been properly considered by the  First-tier
    Judge. There is nothing to suggest that the First-tier  judge  has  not
    considered all the evidence before him.  He does not  require  to  list
    all the pieces of evidence which he has considered and it is clear that
    he finds, not only from the previous determination but  also  from  the
    expert report, that the Appellant has not been telling the truth and he
    should not be given any credit for his lies.

23. The judge has come to his decision because of a lack of credibility. It
    is not an error to state  that,  based  on  what  was  before  him,  he
    believes the Appellant can be returned  safely  to  South  Sudan.  This
    statement has been properly explained. There is no error of law in  the
    First-tier judge's decision.

24. With regard to Article 8 and the Appellant's child, the child's  mother
    is a Gambian national with no settled status in the United Kingdom  and
    may well be being returned to The Gambia with the child.  There  is  no
    error when the judge states that the Appellant can go to  see  his  ex-
    partner and child in The Gambia and maintain contact with them  through
    other means if he returns to Southern Sudan.  The judge finds there  to
    be no compelling circumstances in this aspect of the claim  and  states
    that any private life has been established while the Appellant's status
    in the United Kingdom was precarious and that any interference with his
    private life would be proportionate.

25. Although the Appellant states that he is stateless it is clear that the
    judge does not find that to be the case.  When the said case of  KF  is
    considered the judge is correct in  this  finding  based  on  what  was
    before him.

Notice of Decision

26. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Judge's decision.

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on  13th  May  2015
    must stand.

28. Anonymity has been directed.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
