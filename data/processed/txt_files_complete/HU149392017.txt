                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. In a decision sent on 24 January 2019 I concluded that the  decision
       of the First-tier Tribunal ('FTT') allowing  Mr  Chaudhary's  appeal
       contains an errors of law, such that it was set aside.  I now remake
       the decision.


Background facts

    2. Mr Chaudhary is a citizen of Bangladesh who  entered  the  UK  as  a
       student on 7 April 2010.  The FTT found that in  an  application  to
       extend his leave as a student  dated  16  July  2012,  Mr  Chaudhary
       relied  upon  an  English  language  test   certificate   from   the
       Educational  Testing  Service  ('ETS'),  which  he  received   after
       exercising deception ('the  2012  certificate').   His  leave  as  a
       student was extended until 13 January  2014  as  a  result  of  that
       application.


    3. Mr Chaudhary's leave as  a  student  was  extended  on  two  further
       occasions but curtailed to expire on 14 May 2016.  He  made  an  in-
       time application to remain as a Tier 2 skilled worker but  this  was
       rejected on 6 January 2016.  He made a further application  (in-time
       on 13 May 2016) in order to remain outside the Immigration Rules.

    4. Mr Chaudhary married Mrs Chaudhary, a British citizen, on 7 May 2016
       and on 5 November 2016  varied  his  application  in  favour  of  an
       application for leave to remain as a spouse.  This  application  was
       refused and certified in a decision dated 23 March 2017.   This  was
       overtaken by a decision dated 2 November  2017  in  which  the  SSHD
       comprehensively rejected Mr Chaudhary's application to remain as the
       spouse of a settled person in the UK.

    5. After hearing evidence from Mr Chaudhary and his wife at  a  hearing
       in late 2017, the FTT accepted  that  they  are  in  a  genuine  and
       subsisting  relationship  but   rejected   Mr   Chaudhary's   claim,
       maintained during the  course  of  the  hearing,  that  he  did  not
       exercise deception in  obtaining  the  2012  certificate.   The  FTT
       concluded that the SSHD met the legal burden of establishing that Mr
       Chaudhary used deception in obtaining  and  relying  upon  the  2012
       certificate.  These are preserved findings of  fact.   However,  the
       FTT allowed the appeal on the basis, inter  alia,  that  the  couple
       would face insurmountable obstacles in Bangladesh,  particularly  in
       the light of Mrs Chaudhary's then pregnancy.

    6. Mrs Chaudhary is employed on a permanent contract  on  a  salary  of
       �19000 pa, since June  2016  and  has  provided  pay  slips  and  an
       employment  letter  in  support  of  this.   The  couple   are   now
       considering IVF  treatment  following  Mrs  Chaudhary's  unfortunate
       miscarriage in 2018.  They do not have any children.  They  wish  to
       remain in the UK and believe that there are insurmountable obstacles
       to family life in Bangladesh.

Preliminary issue

    7. At the beginning of the hearing Mr Brown made an application  for  a
       stay to enable him to make an application  to  cross-appeal  against
       the FTT's finding of fact that Mr Chaudhary exercised deception, out
       of time.  I refused the application.  In my view any application for
       an extension of time is bound to fail in the light  of  the  serious
       and significant delay, together with  the  stage  these  proceedings
       have reached.  The SSHD was granted permission to appeal against the
       FTT's decision as long ago as 13 July 2018.    In directions dated 2
       August 2018, it was made clear that any response  to  the  grant  of
       permission pursuant to rule 24, should be served within a month.  At
       the error of law hearing  on  18  January  2019,  Counsel  who  then
       appeared before Mr Chaudhary relied upon a skeleton  argument.  This
       focussed upon the proposition that the FTT was entitled to find that
       the 'suitability' requirements in  the  Immigration  Rules  did  not
       apply to this case, notwithstanding the FTT's factual  finding  that
       Mr  Chaudhary  failed  to  provide  an  innocent   explanation   for
       participating in an English test found  to  be  fraudulent.   In  my
       error of law decision sent on 24 January 2019, I made it clear  that
       this is a preserved finding of fact.


    8. It follows that for the first time at the hearing on 26 March  2019,
       and without giving any prior notice,  Mr  Chaudhary  has  sought  to
       impugn a preserved finding of fact, uninfected by any error of  law.
       This comes over seven  months  after  permission  was  granted.   In
       addition, there is no explanation for the delay.  Mr  Chaudhary  has
       been  legally  represented  throughout.   There  are  no  compelling
       reasons for the matter to be raised so late in the proceedings,  and
       after the issues in dispute were  the  subject  of  submissions  and
       delineated at the error of law hearing.

Issues in dispute

    9. Given my refusal of his application for a stay,  Mr  Brown  accepted
       that the hearing had to be approached on the basis that there was  a
       preserved finding of fact that Mr Chaudhary had exercised deception.


   10. After further preliminary discussions, both  representatives  agreed
       that the factual matrix was mostly agreed but Mr and  Mrs  Chaudhary
       should both be called as witnesses to clarify the nature and  extent
       of  the  claimed  insurmountable  obstacles  to   family   life   in
       Bangladesh.  I indicated  that  I  was  particularly  interested  in
       further evidence relevant to the claim that Mrs Chaudhary would have
       language difficulties in Bangladesh and would not be able to  obtain
       employment.  I permitted Mr Brown to submit a handwritten  statement
       for Mrs Chaudhary to supplement a previous statement before the FTT.

   11. Given the factual matrix set out above and the concerns  articulated
       by  the  SSHD  in  the  decision  subject  to   this   appeal,   the
       representatives agreed  that  the  following  legal  issues  are  in
       dispute and must be determined by me.


       1)  Mr  Chaudhary  is  unable  to  meet  the   specified   financial
          requirements of the Immigration Rules and as such I  must  assess
          whether he can meet the insurmountable obstacles test set out  in
          EX.1. pursuant to section EX of Appendix FM  to  the  Immigration
          Rules.  Even if he can meet the insurmountable obstacles test, he
          must still meet the  suitability requirements in order to succeed
          under the Immigration Rules.
       2) The parties agreed that if Mr Chaudhary  is  able  to  meet  both
          requirements, his appeal should be allowed under Article 8 of the
          ECHR.  If he is unable to meet at least one requirement I must go
          on to make a decision entirely outside the Immigration Rules.  Mr
          Brown pragmatically did not  make  a  discrete  submission  under
          Article 8, as he accepted that if  the  insurmountable  obstacles
          test could not be met within the  Immigration  Rules,  Article  8
          would be of no additional benefit  to  Mr  Chaudhary,  given  the
          particular factual matrix.


Evidence

   12. Mr and Mrs Chaudhary confirmed their  witness  statements  and  were
       cross-examined.  After hearing their evidence  I  stood  the  matter
       down to enable the parties to  submit  country  background  evidence
       relevant to Mrs Chaudhary's claim that she  would  not  be  able  to
       obtain employment in Bangladesh because of language barriers.


Submissions

   13. Mr Tan invited me to find that Mr Chaudhary's use of  deception  and
       his maintenance of the lie for many years was such that he does  not
       meet the suitability requirements.  He also submitted that when  all
       the  circumstances  are  considered  in  the  round  there  are   no
       insurmountable obstacles preventing family life between  the  couple
       being exercised in Bangladesh. He  took  me  to  country  background
       evidence in support of his submission that Mrs  Chaudhary  would  be
       able to use her limited Bengali skills together with her English  to
       obtain employment in Bangladesh.

   14. Mr Brown reminded me that the use of deception in this case is based
       solely upon a "cheating incident" in 2012.  He submitted  that  this
       may be reprehensible but it did not meet the criminal threshold.  He
       urged me to find that Mr Chaudhary was in a difficult position as he
       could not admit the deception because he maintained  his  innocence,
       yet there was a finding of fact by the  FTT that he was stuck  with.
        Mr Brown argued that I should be very cautious about  finding  that
       because of the cheating incident, Mr Chaudhary's presence in the  UK
       would not be conducive to the public good, otherwise all  ETS  cases
       would fail for reasons relating to 'suitability'.

   15. Mr Brown invited me to find that Mrs Chaudhary's inability  to  read
       and write in Bengali would place her at a  substantial  disadvantage
       in the Bangladeshi labour market and constitutes  an  insurmountable
       obstacle when assessed cumulatively alongside  her  health  concerns
       and absence of any family in Bangladesh.

   16. After hearing from both representatives,  I  reserved  my  decision,
       which I now give with reasons.

Discussion

General approach to the Immigration Rules

   17. I begin with consideration of Mr Chaudhary's family life application
       within the Rules.   It was not contended on  Mr  Chaudhary's  behalf
       that he should be permitted to remain in the UK on the basis of  his
       private life (within or outside the Immigration Rules).


   18. The representatives agreed that Mr Chaudhary is unable to  meet  the
       financial eligibility requirements of the Immigration Rules, because
       the SSHD was not provided with the requisite specified evidence with
       the application.  Mr Tan did not  however  dispute  Mrs  Chaudhary's
       claim that she has worked full-time as an analyst at the Bank of New
       York Mellon since June 2016 and now earns �19,000 pa (in  excess  of
       the minimum threshold). As the eligibility  requirements  cannot  be
       met, I turn to R-LTRP.1.1(d).  Given the facts that are agreed,  the
       representatives accepted that Mr Chaudhary can only benefit from the
       exception at EX.1 if the following matters are established:  (i)  he
       does not fall for refusal under  the  suitability  requirements  and
       (ii) there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  with  Mrs
       Chaudhary continuing in Bangladesh - see Sabir (Appendix FM  -  EX.1
       not free-standing) [2014] UKUT 00063 (IAC).

Suitability

   19. I turn firstly to the suitability requirements.  The FTT has already
       found  that  the  appellant  has   not   established   an   innocent
       explanation, and this is a preserved finding - see [23] of my  error
       of law decision.  The respondent has relied  upon  S-LTR.1.6,  which
       states as follows:

            "S-LTR.1.6.     The presence of the applicant in the UK is  not
           conducive to the public good because  their  conduct  (including
           convictions which do not fall  within  paragraphs  S-LR.1.3.  to
           1.5.),  character,  associations,  or  other  reasons,  make  it
           undesirable to allow them to remain in the UK."

   20. The appellant  has  been  found  to  have  exercised  deception.   I
       appreciate that he was not the organiser of the fraud, that this was
       a widespread fraud and  that  many  others  took  advantage  of  the
       fraudulent enterprise.   In my view  the  deception  is  nonetheless
       serious as it was perpetrated  with  a  view  to  circumventing  the
       requirements of the Rules and therefore undermining  the  system  of
       immigration control.  The FTT considered it to be beyond  any  doubt
       that such conduct is of a type  relevant  for  the  purposes  of  S-
       LTR.1.6. at [27] of its decision.  I agree with the  FTT's  decision
       at [29] that I must make my own assessment of  the  gravity  of  the
       conduct  and  the  extent  to  which  it  damages  the   appellant's
       character.  I acknowledge that the "cheating incident", as Mr  Brown
       put it, took place nearly seven years ago.  The 2012 certificate was
       used in support of only one application for leave.  It is  difficult
       to understand why the appellant took part in this fraud when he  had
       sufficient command of English  to  be  awarded  a  degree  from  the
       University of Sunderland in October 2014.  This and a host of  other
       factors were considered by the FTT at [20] and [23] of its decision,
       but were considered insufficient to support an innocent explanation.
        As I have explained above, this is an  unappealed  factual  finding
       that has been preserved.


   21. I also acknowledge, as the FTT observed at  [30]  and  [31]  of  its
       decision, that Mr Chaudhary's conduct involves no criminal behaviour
       and cannot be said to be as serious as that set out  in  the  SSHD's
       guidance.  However, Mr Chaudhary's deceptive conduct is not  limited
       to  the  "cheating  incident".   He  relied  upon  the  fraudulently
       obtained  certificate  in  an  application  for   leave   but   more
       significantly, has maintained the lie  about  the  2012  certificate
       before the FTT and before me.  He maintains his innocence  but  this
       does not mitigate his use of deception and continuing denial of that
       deception over many years.  His  maintenance  of  his  innocence  is
       inconsistent with his  failure  to  seek  to  cross-appeal  the  FTT
       finding that he  did  not  provide  an  innocent  explanation.   The
       appellant has been represented by experienced solicitors and Counsel
       throughout these proceedings.  He is tertiary educated.  If,  as  Mr
       Brown (who did not appear on behalf  of  Mr  Chaudhary  in  previous
       proceedings) submitted, it was an oversight not to  cross-appeal,  I
       have been provided with no clear explanation for the failure  to  do
       so at each of the many  opportunities  available  to  Mr  Chaudhary.
       This  means  that  Mr  Chaudhary  continues  to  maintain   a   lie,
       notwithstanding the FTT's finding and his  failure  to  cross-appeal
       that finding.  When that is considered in the round with the use  of
       deception in 2012, I am satisfied that the appellant's  conduct  and
       character make it undesirable for him to remain in the  UK  and  his
       presence is not conducive to the public good.


   22. Since the appellant is unable to meet the suitability  requirements,
       it follows that he is unable to  benefit  from  paragraph  EX.1.  of
       Appendix FM.  I nonetheless go  on  to  address  the  insurmountable
       obstacles test on the basis that I am wrong  about  the  suitability
       requirements.

EX.1 - Insurmountable obstacles

   23. In SSHD v R (Kaur) [2018] EWCA Civ 1423, [2018] Imm  AR  5  (24  May
       2018),  the  Court  of  Appeal  emphasised  how  high  the  bar   of
       insurmountable obstacles was for the purposes of paragraph  EX.1.(b)
       of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules and the distinction  between
       evidence of the same  (particularly  as  to  the  situation  in  the
       proposed country to which the parties would return, rather than  the
       situation in the UK) and mere  assertion.   I  have  considered  the
       evidence adduced cumulatively but do not accept there would be  very
       serious difficulties which either could not  be  overcome  or  would
       entail very serious hardship.


   24. I accept that Mrs Chaudhary  will  face  difficulties  in  obtaining
       employment.  These cannot be properly described as very serious.   I
       acknowledge that the FTT regarded her to be a truthful witness.  She
       was  a  largely  truthful  witness  before  me   but   unfortunately
       exaggerated her likely linguistic difficulties in  Bangladesh.   She
       explained that she could speak (but could not read or write) Bangla,
       which she described as the language of the villages  in  Bangladesh.
       She also explained that she could not  speak  Dahkia,  the  language
       used in more formal employment settings in Bangladesh.  I asked  her
       to  spell   both   languages   to   ensure   that   there   was   no
       misunderstanding.  Mr Brown accepted that there  is  no  evidentiary
       foundation in the country background evidence for the assertion that
       Bangla is spoken in the villages and not in  more  formal  settings,
       wherein Dahkia is spoken.  Mr Brown speculated  that  Mrs  Chaudhary
       might have meant Sylheti not Dahkia.  I do  not  accept  this.   The
       information provided to me establishes that Sylheti  is  a  language
       spoken in Habiganj District and  other  regions  of  Bangladesh  (by
       about 10 million people).  It is not a language that is said  to  be
       used in more formal settings. Bengali (also known as Bangla), is the
       primary language spoken (nearly 230 million people)  and  serves  as
       the lingua franca  of  Bangladesh.   It  is  not  limited  to  rural
       Bangladesh, as maintained by Mrs Chaudhary.  English has no official
       status  but  is  prevalent  across  government,  law,  business  and
       education and regarded as  the  de  facto  co-official  language  of
       Bangladesh.  The information provided to me by Mr Tan makes it clear
       that English is important and prevalent in the Bangladesh employment
       sector.

   25.  Although  Mrs  Chaudhary  may  initially  find  life  and   gaining
       employment difficult in Bangladesh, I am satisfied that she has  the
       necessary skills and experience to settle into Bangladesh.  She  was
       born in Bangladesh as were both her parents, albeit she came to  the
       UK as a very young child.  She has returned to  Bangladesh  in  2008
       when her grandfather died and stayed for four months.   She  may  no
       longer have any family members living in Bangladesh, but she has  an
       awareness and understanding of  Bangladeshi  culture  and  identity.
       Mrs Chaudhary has experience of working in the banking  industry  in
       the UK.  Her first language is English.  These are likely  to  serve
       her well when seeking employment in Bangladesh.  I  appreciate  that
       Mrs Chaudhary is  unable  to  read  and  write  in  Bengali.   I  am
       confident that these are skills that she can acquire  quickly  given
       her ability to speak the language.  She is unlikely to need to  read
       and write in Bengali to any great extent in the banking  sector  and
       her proficiency in English is likely to compensate for this.

   26. In any event, I am satisfied that Mr and Mrs Chaudhary will be  able
       to support each other through any difficulties they  may  encounter.
       There is no reason why Mr Chaudhary cannot work whilst Mrs Chaudhary
       improves her Bengali skills.   He  is  a  University  graduate  with
       employment experience in the UK, and able to speak English.   He  is
       very familiar with the Bangladeshi way of life, having  lived  there
       for most of his life.

   27. I appreciate that Mrs Chaudhary shall be leaving her  entire  family
       in the UK.  I have considered her brother's statement and  I  accept
       she is close to her parents and brothers.  It will be  difficult  to
       live away from them, but they can  visit  each  other  and  maintain
       contact online.  This will be difficult but Mrs Chaudhary  would  be
       able  to  cope  with  the  love  and  support  of  her  husband.  Mr
       Chaudhary's immediate family no longer reside in  Bangladesh.   Many
       couples are able to cope without family members living in  the  same
       country as them.  It may be difficult at first,  but  they  will  be
       able to settle and make friends with time.

   28. I also accept that Mrs Chaudhary has had to cope with a  miscarriage
       in 2018 and the difficult news that she may not be able to  conceive
       a child naturally, for health reasons.  She clarified  in  her  oral
       evidence that they were considering IVF but had not  made  any  firm
       plans.  This is because she has been  advised  that  she  must  lose
       weight before she can begin treatment.  She does  not  believe  this
       will be  possible  because  of  other  health  concerns.   Mr  Brown
       submitted that without employment in Bangladesh,  the  couple  would
       not be able to access IVF.  I do not accept that the couple will  be
       unable to gain decent employment for the  reasons  I  have  set  out
       above.  Mr Tan has  provided  evidence  that  IVF  is  available  in
       Bangladesh.  Mr Brown did not rely on any evidence to call this into
       question.  I am satisfied that should  they  wish  to  commence  IVF
       treatment in Bangladesh, take course is open  to  them.   The  claim
       that IVF would be unaffordable in Bangladesh is not supported by any
       evidence.  I also reject Mr Chaudhary's claim that  in  the  UK  Mrs
       Chaudhary's employer would contribute to the cost of IVF  treatment.
       There was no support for this assertion from Mrs  Chaudhary  or  the
       documentary evidence, and Mr Brown  did  not  rely  on  this  during
       submissions.  In any event, the employer's contribution  to  IVF  in
       the UK, when this is a course Mrs Chaudhary has not yet committed to
       does not either by itself or when considered in the round change  my
       conclusion regarding the absence of insurmountable obstacles.

   29. When all the evidence is viewed together, it is insufficient to meet
       the high threshold required by the insurmountable obstacles test.

Article 8 and section 117B considerations

   30. Mr Brown did not make any discrete submissions under Article 8  more
       generally but I address it for the sake of completeness.


   31. In TZ (Pakistan) and PG (India) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 1109,  [2018]
       Imm AR 1301   (17  May  2018)  the  Court  of  Appeal  gave  further
       consideration to the principles set out in R (Agyarko) v SSHD [2017]
       UKSC 11 concerning the application of Article 8 in situations  where
       non-settled migrants sought leave to remain outside the  Immigration
       Rules, relying on relationships established  with  British  citizens
       when their immigration status was  precarious.   Proportionality  is
       the "public interest question" within the meaning of Part 5A of  the
       Nationality and Immigration  Act  2002.  By  section  117A(2)  I  am
       obliged to have regard to the considerations listed in section 117B,
       and do so below.

   32. The public interest in  the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
       controls is directly engaged in this case.  There is a strong public
       interest in removing Mr Chaudhary, irrespective of my assessment  of
       the suitability requirements.  Mr Chaudhary has always been  in  the
       UK on a temporary and precarious basis.  He  was  in  the  UK  in  a
       temporary capacity when commenced a relationship with Mrs Chaudhary.
        They married on 7 May 2016 in the full knowledge that his leave was
       curtailed to expire on 14 May 2016.  He has also employed  deception
       in the past and maintained a lie about this.  He is unable  to  meet
       the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  The  evaluation  of  the
       insurmountable obstacles test I have undertaken above,  informs  the
       evaluation outside the Immigration Rules because that formulated the
       strength of the public interest in  immigration  control  -  see  TK
       (Pakistan) (supra) at [32-34].

   33. On the other hand, Mrs Chaudhary has lived in the UK  for  the  vast
       majority of her life and has extensive family and  employment  links
       to the UK. There is no infringement of the "English speaking" public
       interest.  The economic interest is not engaged, given the income of
       the family unit.  I attach limited weight to Mr Chaudhary's  private
       life given his precarious status throughout and the absence  of  any
       particularly compelling circumstances - see Rhuppiah v  SSHD  [2018]
       UKSC  58  (14  November  2018).   Mrs  Chaudhary  has   suffered   a
       miscarriage in 2018 but the option of IVF available to her in the UK
       is likely to be available in Bangladesh, and she  will  be  able  to
       cope even without the support of her own family, with the  love  and
       support of her husband.   The  strength  of  the  public  policy  in
       immigration control is not outweighed by the Article 8 matters which
       militate in favour of the couple.

Decision

   34. I dismiss the appeal on Article 8 of the ECHR grounds.
