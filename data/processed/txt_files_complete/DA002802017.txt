                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision dated 10 December 2018 of First-
    Tier Tribunal Judge Parkes which refused the appeal of Ms  [B]  against
    deportation under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2016 (the EEA Regulations).







    Background

 2. The appellant was born in Italy on [~] 1978. She came to the UK in 2003
    and  worked  continuously  after  arrival,  paying  tax  and   national
    insurance on her earnings.

 3. On 26 October 2015 the appellant was convicted of 18  counts  of  theft
    from  her  employer  and  16  counts  of   dishonestly   making   false
    representations for gain. On 20 June 2016 she  was  sentenced  to  four
    years' imprisonment.

 4. The length of the sentence is an obvious indication of the  seriousness
    of the offences.  The thefts from her  employer,  totalling  well  over
    �100,000, began in 2012 whilst she was working  as  a  bookkeeper.  The
    sentencing remarks refer to the sophisticated  nature  of  the  thefts,
    significant amount of  planning  required  and  significant  breach  of
    trust. The appellant initially  sought  to  conceal  the  thefts,  only
    repaying all but �20,000 of the stolen money after the  employer  began
    an investigation.

 5. After the employer began to investigate the thefts, the appellant  went
    on to commit the VAT frauds of approximately �120,000.  The  sentencing
    remarks  again  refer  to  the  sophistication  of  the  offences   and
    significant planning required to set up shell companies to  make  false
    VAT refund claims over a sustained period of time.

 6. In response to these convictions, the  respondent  made  a  deportation
    order against the appellant on 2 March  2017.  The  appellant  appealed
    that decision to the First-Tier Tribunal. Her case was initially  heard
    by First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Chohan  who  allowed  the  appeal.  In  a
    decision dated 20 November 2017 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Blum  found  an
    error of law in the decision of First-Tier Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  and
    remitted the appeal to be re-made in the First-Tier Tribunal. Thus, the
    appeal came before First-Tier Tribunal Judge Parkes on 20 June 2018 and
    19 November 2018. The second hearing was in order for the  Tribunal  to
    be provided with the sentencing remarks and an updated OASys report.

    Decision of the First-Tier Tribunal

 7. First-Tier Tribunal Judge Parkes did not accept that the appellant  was
    entitled  to  the  highest  "imperative"  level  of   protection   from
    expulsion. At [15] he found:

         "The Appellant's length of residence and whether she qualifies  for
         the highest level of protection is the appropriate place  to  start
         the consideration of the facts. The expulsion decision was made  on
         the 2nd of March 2017. Going back 10 years from that  date  to  the
         2nd of March 2007  the  Appellant's  continuity  of  residence  was
         broken by her being sent to prison on the 20th June  2016.  Clearly
         that broke the 10 year period. Another issue  that  undermines  the
         Appellant's  claims  regarding  the  integrative  links   she   had
         established are the offences committed, the  length  of  time  over
         which they were committed and the degree of persistence involved."

 8. In paragraphs [16]-[20] the judge placed adverse weight on a number  of
    aspects of the appellant's criminal offences, including the  period  of
    time over which they were committed,  the  late  guilty  plea  and  her
    having continued offending even  after  her  employer  interviewed  her
    about the thefts. He found that she had tried to minimise her offending
    and was not truly remorseful.

 9. At [21] the First-Tier Tribunal noted that the appellant had a "lengthy
    and continuous work history in the UK and has a circle of  friends  and
    relations in this country." Judge Parkes also noted at  [23]  that  she
    had been asked to assist with rehabilitating other offenders  and  that
    her OASys report was positive as to how she had addressed her offending
    and assessed her risk of reoffending as low.

10. At [24] the judge found that the reference  in  paragraph  2.8  of  the
    OASys report dated 16 November  2018  to  the  appellant  retaining  an
    "equivocal stance" to her offending weighed against her.

11. The First-Tier Tribunal concluded at [25]:

         "Having regard to the matters considered  above  I  find  that  the
         Appellant has not  shown  that  she  could  be  regarded  as  being
         sufficiently integrated to be able to say that  she  benefits  from
         the enhanced level of protection from  deportation  under  the  EEA
         Regulations. The Appellant clearly has 5 years lawful residence and
         in  the  circumstances  the  Appellant   has   obtained   permanent
         residence. In those circumstances deportation can only be justified
         on serious grounds of public  policy  or  security  and  if  it  is
         proportionate."

12. The judge went on in [26]-[29] to rehearse the adverse aspects  of  the
    criminal offences and the appellant's attitude to them and found her to
    be "a risk  within  the  community  of  re-offending  dishonestly".  He
    concluded that the appellant met the  "serious"  level  of  threat  and
    dismissed the appeal.

    Grounds of Appeal

13. Mr Fraser's skeleton argument summarised the grounds as follows:

      1) The FTT judge erred in his determination that the Appellant is  not
         entitled to the highest level  of  protection  against  deportation
         under regulation 27(4) of the EEA Regs,  namely  a  requirement  to
         demonstrate "imperative grounds of public security".

      2) The FTT judge erred  in  his  consideration  of  whether,  applying
         either the "imperative grounds" or "serious grounds" threshold, the
         Appellant's  deportation  is  justified  having   regard   to   the
         principles and considerations in regulation 27(5)-(6) and  Schedule
         1 to the EEA Regs.

14. We concluded that both grounds were made out.

15. Regulation 27(4) of the EEA Regulations provides that:

         'A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative  grounds
         of public security in respect of an EEA national who -

             (a)  Has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period
                  of at least ten years prior to the relevant decision'

16. Regulation 3(3) qualifies that protection, stating that  continuity  of
    residence is broken if a person serves a sentence of imprisonment.

17.  Regulation  3(4)  qualifies  the  application  of   Regulation   3(3),
    providing:

         '(4) Paragraph (3)(a) applies, in principle, to an EEA national who
         has resided in the United Kingdom for at least ten  years,  but  it
         does not apply where the Secretary of State considers that-

               a) prior to serving  a  sentence  of  imprisonment,  the  EEA
                  national had forged  integrating  links  with  the  United
                  Kingdom;

               b) the effect of the sentence of imprisonment was not such as
                  to break those integrating links; and

               c) taking into account  an  overall  assessment  of  the  EEA
                  national's situation, it would not be appropriate to apply
                  paragraph (3)(a) to the assessment of that EEA  national's
                  continuity of residence.'

 18. These provisions were  introduced  to  the  EEA  Regulations  following
     decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), notably
     the case of SSHD v Vomero (C-424/16) and B v Land Baden-W�rttemberg (C-
     316/16) [2018] 3 W.L.R. 1035 (17 April 2018).  The CJEU said in  Vomero
     at [70]-[74]:

         "70. ... In the context of  that  overall  assessment,  periods  of
             imprisonment must be taken into  consideration  together  with
             all the relevant factors in each individual  case,  including,
             as the case may be, the circumstance that the person concerned
             resided in the host Member State for the  10  years  preceding
             his imprisonment (see, to that effect, judgment of 16  January
             2014, G., C-400/12, EU:C:2014:9, paragraphs 33 to 38).

         71. Indeed, particularly in the case of a Union  citizen  who  was
             already in a position to satisfy the condition  of  10  years'
             continuous residence in the host Member  State  in  the  past,
             even before he committed a criminal act that resulted  in  his
             detention, the fact that the person concerned  was  placed  in
             custody by the authorities of that State cannot be regarded as
             automatically breaking the integrative links that that  person
             had previously forged with that State and  the  continuity  of
             his residence  in  that  State  for  the  purpose  of  Article
             28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38 and, therefore, depriving him of
             the enhanced protection against expulsion provided for in that
             provision. Moreover, such an interpretation would deprive that
             provision of much of its practical effect, since an  expulsion
             measure will most often be adopted precisely  because  of  the
             conduct of the person concerned that led to his conviction and
             detention.

         72. As part of the overall assessment, mentioned in  paragraph  70
             above, which, in this case, is  for  the  referring  court  to
             carry out, it is necessary to take into  account,  as  regards
             the integrative links forged by B with the host  Member  State
             during the period of residence before his detention, the  fact
             that, the more those integrative links  with  that  State  are
             solid  -  including  from  a  social,  cultural   and   family
             perspective, to the  point  where,  for  example,  the  person
             concerned is genuinely rooted in the society of that State, as
             found by the referring court in the  main  proceedings  -  the
             lower the probability that a period of  detention  could  have
             resulted in those links  being  broken  and,  consequently,  a
             discontinuity of the 10-year period of residence  referred  to
             in Article 28(3)(a) of Directive 2004/38.

         73. Other relevant factors in that overall assessment may include,
             as observed by the Advocate General in points 123  to  125  of
             his Opinion, first, the nature of the offence that resulted in
             the period of imprisonment in question and  the  circumstances
             in which that offence was committed, and,  secondly,  all  the
             relevant factors  as  regards  the  behaviour  of  the  person
             concerned during the period of imprisonment.

         74. While the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which
             it was committed shed light on the extent to which the  person
             concerned has, as the case may be,  become  disconnected  from
             the society of the host Member  State,  the  attitude  of  the
             person concerned during his detention may, in turn,  reinforce
             that disconnection or, conversely, help to maintain or restore
             links previously forged with the host Member State with a view
             to his future social reintegration in that State."

19. In order to assess whether she  retained  continuous  residence  of  10
    years, the correct the First-Tier Tribunal  was  required  to  ask  the
    questions set by Regulation 3(4):

          1) Prior to imprisonment, had the  Appellant  forged  integrating
             links?

          2) Was the effect of her imprisonment  such  as  to  break  those
             integrating links?

          3) Taking into account an overall assessment  of  her  situation,
             would it be appropriate to regard imprisonment as breaking her
             continuity of residence?

20. We were not  able  to  identify  anywhere  in  the  decision  that  the
    Regulation 3(4) tests were appreciated and applied.  The  reference  in
    [3] to length of residence raising the question of integration  is  not
    capable of being read as a statement  of  the  principles  set  out  in
    Regulation 3 and does not purport to be any  form  of  assessment.  The
    bare statement in [15] that the imprisonment in  2016  "clearly"  broke
    the 10 year period of continuous residence  is  inconsistent  with  the
    provisions of Regulation 3 and the guidance of  the  CJEU  at  [71]  of
    Vomero. The  reference  to  an  assessment  of  "integration"  in  [15]
    suggests that it was viewed as a separate consideration rather than  an
    essential part of the test  of  whether  continuity  of  residence  was
    retained and "imperative" protection available. The reference  in  [25]
    to  a  test  of  whether  an  individual  can  be  regarded  "as  being
    sufficiently integrated" is again not capable of showing that the judge
    appreciated the provisions of Regulation 3(4).

21. It was also our view that it was not  possible  to  conclude  that  the
    decision would have been the same had the  correct  legal  matrix  been
    applied. The first stage of the test set out in Regulation 3 (4) is  an
    assessment of integration prior to imprisonment. This puts the evidence
    of the appellant's 9 years of lawful residence prior to  the  offending
    behaviour, her work history and  social  involvement  with  family  and
    friends at the forefront  of  the  assessment.  There  is  only  a  one
    sentence summary of the appellant's history prior to offending in  [21]
    of  the  decision.  The  remainder  of  [16]-[24]  which  underpin  the
    conclusion that the appellant is  not  "sufficiently  integrated",  are
    concerned only with the criminal offences and the appellant's  attitude
    to them. That approach is not in line with the provisions of Regulation
    3 or the guidance of Vomero at [72].

22. If more is needed, we also agreed with the submission that  the  First-
    Tier Tribunal took an incorrect approach to the appellant's evidence on
    her view of her offences and the OASys report. The appellant's evidence
    was that she accepted her culpability entirely. She  set  this  out  in
    some detail in a letter to the respondent dated 2 August 2016 which  is
    at page 69 of the  appellant's  bundle  of  evidence.  In  her  witness
    statement dated 11  August  2017  at  paragraph  21,  contrary  to  the
    comments in [18] and [19] of the  decision,  she  states  that  "I  did
    something wrong and ... there is no excuse for  it"  and  "I  am  truly
    sorry and regretful  for  what  I  did".  Nothing  indicates  that  her
    evidence at the hearing in any way resiled from  those  statements.  We
    were not taken to any evidence supporting the comments at [20] that the
    appellant sought to deny or minimise her conduct. We were not taken  to
    any evidence supporting the comment at [20] that since  conviction  the
    appellant claimed that she did not gain from the offences.

23. The OASys report dated 16 November 2018 before the First-Tier  Tribunal
    was an update  of  an  earlier  report.  The  updated  information  was
    identified in the report by the wording "ISP Review - 13/11/2018",  for
    example at 12.8 which states:

         "Ms [B] has demonstrated a very positive and  reassuring  level  of
         motivation throughout her order and has  displayed  an  encouraging
         commitment to addressing her offending behaviour. She has  recently
         returned to HMP Peterborough to deliver a talk to  current  inmates
         about her progress and achievements post release. She has  remained
         in consistent  employment  post  release  and  has  secured  stable
         accommodation  for  herself.  She  has  demonstrated  a   brilliant
         attitude towards her licence and has remained  in  regular  contact
         with her OM. "

24. The First-tier Tribunal did not refer to any of the updated information
    in the OASys report but drew an adverse conclusion from  a  comment  at
    paragraph 2.8 which was not updated and referred to the appellant being
    "equivocal" towards her offences. The fact of this reference not  being
    current was explained to the First-tier Tribunal but weight was  placed
    on it nevertheless. In any event, even if it  was  legitimate  for  the
    judge to consider the entry at 2.8 as relevant to his assessment,  that
    had to be in light of the appellant's explanation that it was  not  the
    current view of  the  Probation  Service,  the  other  highly  positive
    comments in the OASys report and the appellant's consistent evidence as
    to genuine remorse and appreciation of her wrongdoing. Further, even if
    it her position remained "equivocal", this  was  not  determinative  of
    whether  integration  had  been  established  and  whether   continuous
    residence was retained,  Regulation  3(4)  requiring  a  more  holistic
    assessment.

25. It is therefore our conclusion that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal disclosed errors of law in failing to apply the correct  legal
    tests as to whether the appellant should qualify for  the  "imperative"
    level of protection and that the  assessment  that  was  conducted  was
    flawed.

26. It was also our view that the "serious grounds" assessment set  out  at
    [26]-[29] discloses an error of law. We have identified above that  the
    First-tier Tribunal did not take a correct approach to the evidence  on
    the appellant's "equivocal" view of the offences. The "serious grounds"
    assessment repeatedly features her perceived lack of remorse as showing
    her to be a higher risk of offending than stated in the  OASys  report.
    This undermines any conclusion that the "serious" level of  threat  was
    present.

27. Further, even if the appellant had correctly been found to represent  a
    serious threat to public policy and security then an assessment of  the
    proportionality  of  expulsion   had   to   be   conducted,   including
    consideration of the factors identified in Regulation 27(5) and (6) and
    Schedule 1 to the EEA Regulations.  There is no  reference  at  all  to
    these provisions in the decision  other  than  a  bare  statement  that
    deportation was "proportionate" in the final sentence of the  decision.
    The discussion at [26]-[29] does not show that  the  statutory  factors
    were applied in substance. The obvious factors capable of  weighing  in
    the appellant's favour, her long residence,  work  record,  conduct  in
    prison and  notable  rehabilitation  after  her  sentence,  immediately
    obtaining work and assisting the authorities with other  offenders  are
    not addressed at all.

28. It is therefore  also  our  conclusion  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    discloses errors of law such that it must be set aside to be re-made.

    Re-Making

29. The Secretary of State does not dispute that the appellant has acquired
    permanent residence and so cannot be deported unless,  as  provided  by
    Regulation 27(3), it is found that there are "serious grounds of public
    policy and public security".  Our first task, therefore  is  to  assess
    whether the appellant represents "a genuine, present  and  sufficiently
    serious" threat at the "serious" level affecting one of the fundamental
    interests of society, taking into account her past conduct.

30. This assessment was relatively straightforward in light of the  further
    OASys report dated 26 March 2019.  The  following  extracts  accurately
    reflect the overall tenor of the report:

         '2.11

         Ms [B] accepts her guilt, regrets her actions and is ashamed of her
         crime and the impact her offence (and period in  custody)  has  had
         upon her family and her parents especially. However,  Ms  [B]  does
         minimise her crime as she says monies were not spent  and  rewarded
         (sic) back to her employer. When  pressed,  Valentina  acknowledges
         her actions were wholly wrong and critically, illegal.

         2.14

         Ms [B] did not display any risk of serious harm behaviours  in  the
         prison setting and gained a position as a peer mentor to others  in
         custody on her release. She continues to not present  any  risk  of
         serious harm in the community;  indeed  she  has  received  glowing
         reports from her employers, and has consistently positively engaged
         with probation staff as well.

         11.10

         Records (court papers) show that Ms [B]  unequivocally  denied  her
         offence and "balmed (sic) others - namely her  co-worker,  for  her
         offence. Today, Ms  [B]  has  made  positive  developments  in  her
         thinking and accpets (sic) full responsibility for her offence  and
         does not apportion balme (sic) elsewhere. I am  confident  that  Ms
         [B] no longer  blames  others,  and  attributes  her  behaviour  to
         others, and that she wholly accepts responsibility for her offence.

         12.8

         Ms [B] has demonstrated a very positive  and  reassuring  level  of
         motivation throughout her order and displayed an ongoing commitment
         to address her offending behaviour, engaging well  in  appointments
         and responding well to any tasks set. She had also acted as a  peer
         mentor and delivered  talks  to  inmates,  post  release.  She  has
         remained in consistent employment  post  release  and  has  secured
         stable accommodation for herself. I assess that  her  attitudes  do
         not have any contribution to risk  of  serious  harm  or  offending
         behaviour in the present day.

         Ms [B] has maintained a brilliant attitude towards her licence; she
         has complied throughout and has attended every appointment. She has
         remained in constant contact with her OM and undertaking (sic)  all
         tasks  as  required.  She  has  secured  stable  accommodation  and
         employment for herself and is progressing very positively.  She  is
         assessed as a low risk of serious harm and a low risk of offending.

         Page 40

         Ms [B] is currently doing extremely well in the community. She  has
         confronted her guilt and faced the shame she feels  linked  her  to
         her offence. She has complied with her licence and has remained  in
         constant contact with her OM. She also returned to HMP Peterborough
         to  deliver  a  talk  to  current  inmates  on  her  progress   and
         achievements. She is in full time  employment  and  is  progressing
         well at work.'

31. Section 10.6 of the report assesses the appellant as posing a low  risk
    of harm.  The  OASys  report  also  identifies  her  desire  to  retain
    employment,  successful  career   change   with   the   assistance   of
    qualifications  obtained  in  custody,  declarations  of   income   and
    outgoings to probation, being debt free, her family and a  longstanding
    friendship group who stood by her though her imprisonment,  as  factors
    protecting her from reoffending.

32. We found the OASys report provided strong evidence that  the  appellant
    does not represent "a genuine, present and sufficiently serious" threat
    at the "serious" level.  Her  conduct  during  and  after  imprisonment
    showed  significant  and  meaningful  remorse  and  acceptance  of  her
    responsibility for her offences. Her rehabilitation is significant  and
    precludes any other conclusion than that she does not  pose  a  current
    risk at the "serious" level. The threshold for deportation  of  someone
    with permanent residence is therefore not met here. The appeal must  be
    allowed on this basis.

33. If more were needed, and we were required to go on  to  assess  whether
    the appellant qualified for the "imperative" level  of  protection,  we
    would have found in her favour. Her residence prior  to  her  offending
    behaviour comprised 9 years of  work  and  social  involvement  clearly
    amounting to integration.  Her conduct in prison was  highly  positive,
    the  appellant  following  a  significant   number   and   variety   of
    rehabilitation programmes and managing to obtain  employment  prior  to
    being released. Her friends and family remained highly  supportive.  It
    would not have been our conclusion, taking her overall  situation  into
    account, that her sentence of imprisonment did not break her continuity
    of residence and  integrative  links.  It  will  be  obvious  that  her
    offending behaviour and positive rehabilitation show that she does  not
    meet the "imperative" level of threat  required  for  someone  who  has
    resided here for 10 years and remained integrated.

Notice of Decision

    is set aside.

    Economic Area) Regulations 2016.
