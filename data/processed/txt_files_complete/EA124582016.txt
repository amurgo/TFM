                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. In the light of the decision of the Court of  Appeal  in  Khan,  it  is
    clear that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  was  erroneous  in
    law.  I set it aside.

 2. I remit the appellant's appeal  for  determination  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.


                                                           C. M. G. OCKELTON
