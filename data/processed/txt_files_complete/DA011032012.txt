Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr P Duffy, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr A Jafar, Counsel instructed by Thopee & Co
Solicitors
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal of the respondent,  hereinafter
    "the claimant" against the decision of the Secretary of State to deport
    him following an order made under Section 32(5) of the  United  Kingdom
    Borders Act 2007.

 2. This was the second time the claimant's appeal  against  that  decision
    had been allowed.  The previous determination was found  unsatisfactory
    by Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane who decided the case had to be heard
    again in the First-tier Tribunal and it is the subsequent  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal that is the subject of the appeal before me.

 3. Permission to appeal was given by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Plimmer.
    She distilled the following criticism under point 3:

         "The Tribunal's determination is a detailed and  carefully  drafted
         one.  The Tribunal has properly taken into account the  seriousness
         of the offence (paragraph 61) together with the risk posed  by  the
         appellant (paragraphs 62-64).  It  is  however  arguable  that  the
         Tribunal has failed to take into account the other aspects  of  the
         criminal offence above the risk of reoffending: the need  to  deter
         others  and  the  need  to  express  society's  revulsion  at   the
         criminality.  As in SE  (Zimbabwe)  v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  256
         states, it is always appropriate to consider all three  aspects  of
         the individual's offence when assessing whether  Article  8  rights
         should prevail."

 4. In summary outline, Mr Duffy said that Judge Plimmer's  grant  went  to
    the heart of the matter,  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  done  a
    careful determination but had lost sight of an important  part  of  its
    functions and the appeal  needed  to  be  decided  again.   Mr  Jafar's
    response  was  that  the  determination  properly   understood   showed
    consideration of all the things that needed to be  considered  and  the
    Secretary of State had to accept the independent judicial  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal.

 5. I begin by looking at the determination and  seeing  exactly  what  the
    First-tier Tribunal decided.

 6. The claimant first arrived in the United Kingdom in July 1996  when  he
    was 15 years old.  He is now 33 years old.  He came with members of his
    family and was not subject to immigration control  because  his  father
    worked  for  the  Pakistan  High  Commission.    His   exemption   from
    immigration control ended some time in May 2000 but he  did  not  leave
    the United Kingdom.  In July 2003 his father made  an  application  for
    him to have indefinite leave  to  remain.   Eventually  the  claimant's
    siblings and parents were given leave and  became  naturalised  British
    citizens in 2010 but the claimant could not be naturalised  because  of
    his criminal record.

 7. On 20 February 2011 he was convicted at  the  Crown  Court  sitting  at
    Isleworth for an offence colloquially described as  "money  laundering"
    and was sentenced to four years' imprisonment and a confiscation  order
    made in the sum of �17,810.

 8. He did not respond to a notice telling him he was liable for  automatic
    deportation and the deportation order was signed.  This  appeal  is  an
    appeal against the decision to refuse to revoke that order.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal noted that the claimant arrived in  the  United
    Kingdom with his mother and siblings  and  that  the  siblings  started
    school on arrival.  Their circumstances were such that when they had to
    pay school fees they left formal education and started work.

10. The claimant lived in the United Kingdom without  permission  from  May
    2000 until 2003 when his father applied for  the  family  to  be  given
    leave to remain because of the "seven years  children's  policy".   The
    application was refused but an appeal by the family members was allowed
    by the Upper Tribunal.  The claimant was not given leave because he had
    criminal charges against him.

11. The claimant then became the subject of a deportation  order  following
    his conviction on 22 February 2011 as indicated above.

12. The determination then notes the earlier hearing of the appeal that was
    decided wrongly and the Upper Tribunal's ruling that the only  findings
    of  fact  to  be  preserved  were  those  relating  to  the  claimant's
    rehabilitation and activities carried out whilst in detention which  do
    not seem to be controversial.

13. It was noted that the claimant's father had paid the confiscation order
    of �17,810 made at the Crown Court.

14. The First-tier Tribunal accepted the claimant's evidence  that  he  had
    lived industriously in the  United  Kingdom,  that  he  had  undertaken
    courses in prison, that he  had  contacted  his  family  daily  and  by
    telephone during his imprisonment and that the family live together  in
    a house paid for  in  part  by  the  claimant's  contributions  to  the
    mortgage.  The property was owned jointly with his mother.

15. The Tribunal further  accepted  that  the  claimant  had  not  been  to
    Pakistan since arriving in the United Kingdom at the age of 15 years.

16. Apart from his imprisonment and "a  brief  period"  when  the  claimant
    lived in Birmingham he had always lived with his family.

17. It was the claimant's case that his sister was married but his brothers
    were not married.

18. He had some relatives in Pakistan but had had little contact with  them
    since his grandmother had died.

19. The Tribunal accepted evidence from the claimant's immediate family  in
    the United Kingdom that they were unaware of his criminality but highly
    dependent on his contribution to the family funds, that the family  had
    suffered in his absence and there were no close relatives  in  Pakistan
    to assist him in the event of his return.

20. The Tribunal found that the claimant had a "strong  family  bond"  with
    his parents and with his siblings and was in a particularly responsible
    position in the family because he was  the  eldest  son  who  could  be
    expected to and did, give financial support for the  education  of  his
    siblings.

21. The Tribunal was satisfied that the claimant's  relationship  with  his
    immediate family was better understood as being  part  of  his  "family
    life" than his "private life" when considering his private  and  family
    life for the purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on  Human
    Rights.

22. The Tribunal accepted the evidence that the  claimant  had  behaved  in
    prison and there was no evidence that he was likely to reoffend.

23. The claimant's ambition was to  reintegrate  with  his  family  in  the
    United Kingdom.

24. The Tribunal found that in the event of his return the  claimant  would
    have no accommodation in Pakistan and would be "forced to live with  an
    uncle or an aunt who live with their own families".  The Tribunal found
    it "unreasonable to expect this [claimant] to return to Pakistan and to
    re-establish his links with the country of his nationality."

25. The Tribunal repeated that the claimant had committed a serious offence
    for which he had been punished, that he had not reoffended and had very
    close bonds with his family in the United Kingdom.

26.  The   Tribunal   in   all   the   circumstances   removal   would   be
    disproportionate.

27. As Mr Duffy confirmed that the grant of permission to  appeal  set  out
    the gist of the Secretary of State's case I invited Mr Jafar to outline
    his case.  Mr Duffy had the opportunity to give detailed reply.

28. Mr Jafar reminded me, correctly, of the decision of the Court of Appeal
    in AM v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 1634  and  particularly  at  paragraph  22
    where it was made plain that the citation of authority is not important
    in itself.  What mattered "is whether it is discernible from the  FTT's
    reasoning that the correct principles were applied."

29. He submitted that the correct principles were applied by the First-tier
    Tribunal in this case.

30. He pointed out that the Tribunal at  paragraph  47  set  out  in  terms
    paragraph 398 of HC 395.  In particular it reminded  itself  under  the
    heading "A" that "the deportation of the person from the United Kingdom
    is conducive to the public good because they have been convicted of  an
    offence for which they have been sentenced to a period of  imprisonment
    of at least four years."

31. At paragraph 49 the Tribunal expressly reminded itself  that  paragraph
    399A which identified  circumstances  where  a  person  who  had  lived
    continuously in the United Kingdom for a considerable period should not
    be deported.  Clearly the Tribunal was following the Rules as  required
    by the decision in Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules -  correct  approach)
    Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC).   However  the  Tribunal  continued  in
    paragraph 49:

         "The deportation order was made because  the  [claimant]  had  been
         convicted of an offence and sentenced to imprisonment of  at  least
         four years.  What the [claimant] has to  show  is  that  there  are
         exceptional circumstances that exist and that the  public  interest
         which requires deportation is outweighed by the circumstances.  The
         [claimant] states that he has established substantial  private  and
         family life in the UK and his removal will  be  a  disproportionate
         interference to his rights under Article 8 of the ECHR".

32. In short the Tribunal had expressly reminded itself  that  there  is  a
    presumption that deportation is conducive to the  public  good  in  the
    case of persons sentenced to at least four years' imprisonment and that
    exceptional circumstances were needed before  the  public  interest  in
    deportation was outweighed by  the  claimant's  particular  facts.   Mr
    Jafar then reminded me how in AM the Court of Appeal had set  out  part
    of the judgment in JO (Uganda) [2010]  EWCA  Civ  10  at  paragraph  25
    quoting paragraph 29 of JO where the Court of Appeal had suggested that
    circumstances that would make removal  disproportionate  might  not  be
    sufficient  to  make  deportation  disproportionate  because   of   the
    "additional weight to be given to the criminal offending on  which  the
    deportation decision was based" but stressed that the actual weight was
    fact-specific.

33. Without in any way wishing to diminish the seriousness of the  offences
    for which the claimant was convicted Mr Jafar pointed out how this  was
    not a case of violent crime, promotion of  illicit  drugs  or  unlawful
    sexual  activity  and  so  was  not  the  kind  of  offence  that   was
    particularly repugnant to  the  public.   Mr  Jafar  took  me  back  to
    paragraph 49 of the First-tier Tribunal's determination and  said  that
    the Tribunal was correct  in  law  to  say  that  there  needed  to  be
    exceptional  circumstances  before  the   public   interest   requiring
    deportation was outweighed by the particular facts  of  the  claimant's
    case.

34. The direction was correct and there was no reason to think it  had  not
    been followed.

35. At paragraph 64 of its determination the First-tier Tribunal found that
    the claimant was not any  risk  to  the  general  public  and  was  not
    satisfied in this particular case that  the  public  interest  requires
    that the claimant be deported.

36. Nevertheless Mr Jafar also very  properly  drew  my  attention  to  the
    judgment of Elias LJ in AM who, having endorsed the view  that  mantras
    are  not  necessarily  indicative  of  good  decision-making  said   at
    paragraph 49:

         "I have wondered whether in the light of  these  considerations  we
         can properly infer that this specialist Tribunal did have regard to
         the necessary considerations, albeit that they  did  not  refer  to
         them.  But I have concluded, in agreement with Pitchford  LJ,  that
         this would be a step too far.  There is nothing in the decision  or
         even the way in which the arguments were framed before the  FTT  to
         indicate that these wider aspects of the public interest were  ever
         drawn to the Tribunal's attention."

37. They were not focused on by the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  refusal
    letter and the Court of Appeal decided they  had  not  been  considered
    properly.

38. Mr Jafar submitted that here the Tribunal did have the public  interest
    in mind and the fact they had assessed it in a way that does not please
    the Secretary of State does not constitute an error of law.

39. Mr Duffy in reply said that the Tribunal had in mind the possibility of
    reoffending and concluded that the claimant was unlikely  to  reoffend.
    As pointed out by Judge Plimmer when she gave permission to appeal that
    is not enough.  The Tribunal should have had  regard  to  the  need  to
    deter  others  and  the  expression  of  society's  revulsion  at   the
    criminality.

40. Mr Jafar was most persuasive but on reflection I find that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal did err in law.  What the First-tier Tribunal did it  did
    diligently and with conspicuous care.  However it  only  did  half  the
    job.  When conducting the proportionality exercise for the  purpose  of
    the Article 8 evaluation it considered only the public interest in this
    particular claimant not reoffending.  It did not consider  the  general
    deterrent effect and the expression of  society's  disapproval.   These
    two are legitimate interests and have been ignored.

41. This is an error that has to be corrected.  I do not think there is any
    point in sending the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal.  That  has
    been done twice.  Certain things are quite clear.  The  claimant  is  a
    citizen of Pakistan.  He has lived in the United Kingdom since  he  was
    aged 15 years and he is now aged 33 years.   He  has  not  returned  to
    Pakistan after he left it almost eighteen years ago and although he may
    have some relatives in Pakistan there is no evidence of any close  ties
    with the country.  He has established a strong private and family  life
    in the United Kingdom and plays a  bigger  part  in  the  life  of  his
    nuclear family than might ordinarily be expected of a man of  his  age.
    In particular he is the co-owner  of  the  family  home  and  has  made
    significant financial contributions towards it.

42. I do not think the age of  the  siblings  is  set  out  in  the  papers
    although one brother, Muhammed Rauf, was born  on  14  March  1986.   I
    assume all the children have achieved their majority but in  any  event
    both parents are alive and living in the family home.  The claimant  is
    not the father figure in the life of minor children.

43. It follows that although the claimant has lived in the  United  Kingdom
    for some considerable time and  although  his  relationships  with  his
    brothers and parents are more than usually important he is not  in  the
    position of a person with a life partner  who  cannot  be  expected  to
    remove or a minor child looking to him for  fatherly  guidance.   These
    often weighty matters are not present in his case.

44. Although I accept that the claimant has not been convicted of the "sex,
    drugs, violence"  kind  of  offence  which  carries  particular  public
    disapproval he was a significant (I accept not the  major)  participant
    in wholesale money laundering.  This was a very serious crime and  does
    attract a particularly high degree of public repugnance that  ought  to
    be reflected in the balancing exercise.

45. I accept that the claimant has no adult experience of life in  Pakistan
    and in any event the Pakistan that he left when he was aged 15  is  not
    the same place as the  Pakistan  of  today.   Nevertheless  it  is  the
    country of which he is a national.  He will find it hard  to  establish
    himself there but I cannot accept that he cannot establish  himself  in
    that country.  I accept that removing him will cause  significant  hurt
    to the claimant's family members.

46. I also accept that although quite a lot  of  his  time  in  the  United
    Kingdom has been without leave he cannot be held responsible for things
    that happened when he was a minor and although he  could  theoretically
    have introduced himself to the authorities as soon as he  achieved  his
    majority in reality that would have been expecting rather a lot from  a
    young man who might be still expected to defer  to  his  parents.   The
    fact that he was in the United  Kingdom  without  leave  is  a  further
    reason to remove him but in this case it is a peripheral point.

47. Cases involving a person who chooses to commit a very serious  criminal
    offence and so face deportation to a country where he has little or  no
    adult experience are particularly troubling to this  Tribunal  but  the
    Rules make it plain that the public interest requires  the  removal  of
    such people.  Each case is fact-specific and the human  rights  of  the
    person to be removed and (usually more importantly) those  affected  by
    his removal must be considered and considered fully.  Nevertheless, and
    without in any way departing from the factual findings  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal concerning these circumstances I am satisfied  that  when
    the need to express society's disapproval and to discourage  others  is
    factored  into  the  balancing  exercise  the  claimant's  removal   is
    proportionate and the deportation order shall stand.

48. It follows therefore that I find the First-tier Tribunal erred  in  law
    and I substitute a decision dismissing the  claimant's  appeal  against
    the Secretary of State's decision.
