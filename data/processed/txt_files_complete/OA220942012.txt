Representation:

For the Appellant (ECO):   Ms A Everett, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent (Mrs Saleem):     Mr O Popoola, Legal Representative of
                               Community Legal Centre



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal brought by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  a
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Napthine.  For ease of  reference
    I shall refer throughout this  determination  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, who was the original respondent,  as  "the  ECO"  and  to  Mrs
    Saleem, who was the original appellant, as "the claimant".

 2. The claimant is a citizen of Iraq who was born on 16 January 1982.  She
    is married to Mr Razi Tofiq Fatah, a British citizen, on  9  July  2012
    and applied for entry clearance as a spouse the following day.  On  her
    application form she states that this was an arranged marriage.

 3. The application was refused by the ECO on  14  October  2012,  and  the
    notice of immigration decision giving the ECO's reasons for refusal, is
    dated the same date.  The ECO  was  not  satisfied  that  there  was  a
    genuine subsisting marriage between the claimant  and  the  sponsor  or
    that the couple intended to  live  together   permanently  in  the  UK.
    Also, the ECO was not satisfied that either  the  maintenance/financial
    requirements or accommodation requirements set  out  within  the  Rules
    were satisfied.

 4. The claimant appealed against this decision and her  appeal  was  heard
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Napthine sitting at Hatton Cross on 27
    January 2014.   Her  husband,  the  sponsor,  Mr  Fatah  attended  that
    hearing, at which he gave evidence.   Both the  claimant  and  the  ECO
    were represented at that hearing.

 5. In a determination promulgated  on  12  February  2014  Judge  Napthine
    allowed the appellant's appeal.

 6. The ECO now appeals against that decision, permission to appeal  having
    been  granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Shimmin on 10 March 2014.



Grounds of Appeal

 7. The ECO's grounds of appeal are succinct and are as follows:

         "Making a material misdirection in law

         1.   The rules of specified evidence are comprehensively set out in
             Appendix FM-SE to the Immigration Rules.  These set  out  what
             types of evidence are required, the periods they cover and the
             format that they should be in.  The Tribunal has had no regard
             to this at paragraphs 21-24 of the determination where it sets
             out its finding on this issue.  It is  respectfully  submitted
             that the Tribunal has failed to comply  with  the  Immigration
             Rules and that its findings are therefore unsustainable.

         2.   Furthermore, it  is  clear  that  the  Tribunal  has  not  had
             appropriate regard to the relevant date. For Appendix  FM  the
             significant date is the date of application (not the  date  of
             determination - see paragraph 25 of  the  determination  where
             the Tribunal makes this error) and the significant evidence is
             from the specified period before that date. The  Tribunal  has
             not addressed the relevant evidence from prior  to  July  2012
             (the date of application).  This also renders the  conclusions
             unsustainable.

         3.   It follows from this that it is not clear what  the  sponsor's
             actual gross annual income was at the date of application.  It
             also follows that the appeal can therefore not  be  made  out.
             However, it is also worth noting that if the sponsor's current
             income does exceed the income threshold, there is no reason to
             prevent the appellant making a fresh application based on  the
             sponsor's income at this time... ."

 8. When granting permission to appeal, Judge  Shimmin stated as follows:

         "...

         3.   The grounds of appeal argue that the judge erred in  that  (1)
             he has failed to  apply  Appendix  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration
             Rules; (2) he has had regard to the date of determination, not
             as he  should  have  done  under  Appendix  FM,  the  date  of
             application.

         4.   The grounds of appeal disclose an arguable error of law."

 9. Judge Napthine  accepted  that  there  was  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    marriage and also that the accommodation requirements  were  satisfied.
    There is no challenge to these findings.  The judge also found that the
    maintenance requirements were met, on the basis of evidence  which  was
    produced to him and which referred back to the date of  decision.   His
    findings with regard to the sponsor's income are set out at  paragraphs
    21 to 26 of his determination as follows:

         "21. The sponsor had to have an income of �18,600 at the date  [of]
             decision in order to satisfy the requirements of E-ECP.3.1.

         22.  The sponsor had been working for Middlesbrough  Food  Supplies
             until 19/8/2012 when he left.  His P45 shows he earned  �7,350
             from that employment in the 2012-2013 tax year.

         23.  The sponsor  started  trading  on  a  self-employed  basis  as
             "Mobile  Car  Services"  from  1/8/2012.   He   has   produced
             unaudited accounts prepared by Sarmad & Co Chartered Certified
             Accountants, for the period 1/8/2012  to  5/4/2013  showing  a
             taxable income from this venture of �12,800.

         24.  This income is substantiated by the  sponsor's  online  income
             tax return and a letter from HMRC confirming that tax has been
             calculated upon that total income of �20,150.

         25.  It is in the nature of self-employment that a person's  income
             and his tax liability thereon cannot be calculated  until  the
             end of the tax period.  The sponsor could not at the  date  of
             decision have  produced  meaningful  accounts  to  cover  that
             period.  However, the accounts he has produced and the  income
             tax return refer back to that period.

         26.  I am satisfied that the sponsor has produced evidence to  show
             that at the date of  decision  he  had  income  in  excess  of
             �18,600, to wit, �20,150 as shown  by  his  accounts  and  the
             calculation produced by HMRC."



The Hearing

10. I heard submissions  on  behalf  of  both  parties,  which  I  recorded
    contemporaneously in my Record of Proceedings. Accordingly, I shall not
    set out these submissions in full, but shall  summarise  the  arguments
    which were advanced before me. I have however had regard to  everything
    which was said before me as well as  to  all  the  documents  contained
    within the file, whether or not the same is  specifically  referred  to
    below.

11. Ms Everett's submissions can be summarised as follows. The basis of the
    ECO's challenge as set out within the grounds is that it is  now  clear
    from the Rules what evidence can be considered and that with regard  to
    the evidence required under Appendix FM specified evidence  has  to  be
    produced at the time of application.   The  judge  therefore  erred  by
    giving consideration to evidence which he should not  have  taken  into
    account.  Although the judge was satisfied on the  evidence  which  was
    put before him that the claimant did have  the  relevant  income,  this
    finding was made with the benefit of hindsight  which  the  Immigration
    Rules did not allow.  The task for the judge was  to  consider  whether
    when the claimant applied the sponsor could demonstrate that he had the
    income in the way required under the Rules.  There  were  a  number  of
    ways in which income could be demonstrated,  but  these  were  set  out
    within Appendix FM-SE.  Although it was permissible to  look  at  later
    evidence, if it went to the issue to be determined, that  is  not  what
    the judge did.  He looked at the evidence  at  the  date  of  decision,
    which was wrong.  For example he looked at the  sponsor's  income  from
    self-employment, which started after the application had been made.

12. Ms Everett referred  the  Tribunal  to  the  relevant  Rules  regarding
    employment and self-employment and to the evidence which was  required,
    which is referred to below.  As at the date of  decision,  the  sponsor
    had only been self-employed for two months, and had simply not produced
    the documents required.  So far  as  the  evidence  relating  to  self-
    employment was concerned, some of this was post-decision.  Although the
    Rules do not in terms say that  whether  or  not  there  is  sufficient
    income  from  self-employment  must  be  determined  at  the  date   of
    application, it is clear that the information set out  at  paragraph  7
    was not before the ECO at the date of decision.  All the evidence  that
    was before the Tribunal was contained at pages 35 through to page 69 of
    the claimant's bundle.

13. Although it may be the case  that  the  sponsor  would  feel  aggrieved
    because the judge had found that he now earned the  money,  the  answer
    was for the claimant to make another application.

14. On behalf of the  claimant,  Mr  Popoola  submitted  that  the  judge's
    decision should stand, relying on  DR  (Morocco)  and  also  the  Upper
    Tribunal decision in Khatel (which Mr Popoola  was  apparently  unaware
    had been overturned by the Court of Appeal).   It  was  the  claimant's
    submission that the judge was allowed  to  look  at  the  circumstances
    appertaining at the date of decision pursuant to Section 85(4)  of  the
    Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.    The   judge   was
    accordingly right to consider the new evidence which  was  before  him,
    because this was not excluded under Section 85(5)  (that  is  the  sub-
    Section that states that sub-Section (4), which allows  a  Tribunal  to
    consider evidence which it thinks relevant  to  the  substance  of  the
    decision, including evidence which concerns a matter arising after  the
    date of decision, is subject to the exceptions in Section 85A).

15. Although it was accepted that the ECO could not be faulted  for  having
    refused the application on the basis of the evidence which  was  before
    him, nonetheless the judge was right to allow the appeal based  on  the
    new evidence.

16. Mr Popoola submitted that to the extent that what was said  in  Section
    85(5) of the 2002 Act was  inconsistent  with  the  Rules,  Section  85
    should prevail.



Discussion

17. I reserved my decision, but informed the parties that in the event that
    I found that there had been an error of law in the determination of the
    First-tier Tribunal, I would be able to re-make  the  decision  without
    hearing further evidence.

18. I do not consider that there is a conflict between Sections 85 and  85A
    of the 2002 Act and the Rules.

19. Paragraph 85 of the 2002 Act provides as follows:

         "85. Matters to be considered

         ...

         (4)  On an appeal under  Section  82(1)  against  a  decision,  the
             Tribunal may consider  evidence  about  any  matter  which  it
             thinks relevant to the substance of  the  decision,  including
             evidence which concerns a matter arising  after  the  date  of
             decision.

         (5)  But sub-Section (4) is subject to the  exceptions  in  Section
             85A."

20. The exceptions are not relevant in this case.  Accordingly, insofar  as
    Mr Popoola submits that the First-tier Tribunal was  entitled  to  take
    into consideration evidence arising after the  decision  was  made  but
    which appertains to that decision, that submission is correct.

21. However, it does not follow  that  this  means  that  the  claimant  is
    entitled to succeed if she could show merely that the sponsor's  income
    at the relevant date was above the threshold now required, because  the
    Rules require more.  The requirements of the Rules  are  specific  with
    regard to what evidence  must  be  provided  before  income  either  in
    respect of salaried employment or in respect of self-employment can  be
    considered. It follows that the evidence  adduced  after  the  date  of
    decision can only be taken into account to be extent that it shows that
    the requirements under the Rules were indeed satisfied.   Otherwise  it
    will not be relevant to the decision.   This  will  be  explained  more
    fully below in the context of this particular case.

22. The relevant provisions with regard to the specific evidence which must
    be provided in support of the claim  that  the  financial  requirements
    have been satisfied are set out at paragraphs 2 and 7 of Appendix FM-SE
    and are as follows:

         "APPENDIX FM-SE

         FAMILY MEMBERS - SPECIFIED EVIDENCE

         A.   This Appendix sets out the specified evidence applicants  need
             to provide to meet the  requirements  of  Rules  contained  in
             Appendix FM and, where those requirements are  also  contained
             in other Rules and  unless  otherwise  stated,  the  specified
             evidence applicants need to provide to meet  the  requirements
             of those Rules.

         ...

         (2)  In respect of salaried  employment  in  the  UK,  all  of  the
             following evidence must be provided:

             (b)  [There does not appear to be an (a)].  The  P60  for  the
                  relevant period or periods  of  employment  relied  on  if
                  issued.

             (c)  Wage slips covering:

                  (i)   a  period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
                      application if the applicant  has  been  employed  by
                      their current employer for at least six months; or

                  (ii) any period of salaried employment in  the  period  of
                      twelve months prior to the date of application if the
                      applicant has been employed by their current employer
                      for less than six months.

             (d)  A letter from the employer(s) who issued the payslips  at
                  paragraph 2(c) confirming:

                  (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

                  (ii) the length of their employment;

                  (iii)    the period over which they have been or were paid
                      the level of salary relied on in the application; and

                  (iv)  the  type  of  employment   (permanent,   fixed-term
                      contract or agency).

             (e)  A signed statement of employment for employment currently
                  held.

             (f)  Monthly personal bank  statements  corresponding  to  the
                  same period(s)  as  the  wage  slips  at  paragraph  2(c),
                  showing that the salary has been paid into an  account  in
                  the name of the person or in the name of  the  person  and
                  their partner jointly.

             ...

         (7)  In respect of self-employment in the UK as  a  partner,  as  a
             sole trader or in a franchise all of  the  following  must  be
             provided:

             (a)  evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid  and  unpaid,
                  for the last financial year.

             (b)  ..........:

                  (i)  annual self-assessment tax return to HMRC;

                  (ii) statement of account (AS300 or SA302); and

                  (iii)    the same for the previous financial year  if  the
                      latest return does not show the  necessary  level  of
                      gross income, but the average of the last 2 financial
                      years does.

             (c)  Proof of registration with HMRC as  self-employed.   This
                  evidence must be either an original or a certified copy of
                  the registration documentation issued by HMRC.

             (d)  Each partner's unique tax reference number  (UTR)  and/or
                  the UTR of the partnership or business.

             (e)  Where the person holds or held a separate  business  bank
                  account(s), monthly bank statements for the same  12-month
                  period as the tax return(s).

             (f)  Monthly personal bank statements for  the  same  12-month
                  period as the tax return(s) showing that the  income  from
                  self-employment has been paid into an account in the  name
                  of the person or in the  name  of  the  person  and  their
                  partner jointly.

             (g)  Evidence of ongoing self-employment through:

                  (i)  evidence of payment of  class  2  national  insurance
                      contributions (for self-employed persons); or

                  (ii) current appointment reports from Companies House (for
                      directors).

             (h)  One of the following documents must also be submitted:

                  (i)  the organisation's  latest  annual  audited  accounts
                      with:

                      (1)  the name of the account clearly shown; and,

                      (2)  the accountant must be a member of an accredited
                           accounting body.......

                  (ii) A certificate of VAT registration and the latest  VAT
                      return confirming the  VAT  registration  number,  if
                      turnover is in excess of �73,000....".

23. With regard to  the  requirements  under  paragraph  2  in  respect  of
    salaried employment, the requirement under paragraph 2(c)(i) to provide
    wage slips covering a period  of  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application [my emphasis] must be noted  or  in  the  alternative  wage
    slips for a period  of  twelve  months  again  prior  to  the  date  of
    application  with  a  previous  employer  in  circumstances  where  the
    applicant (or in this case the sponsor) had not been employed by  their
    current employer for a period of at least six months.  There is also of
    course the requirement to  provide  monthly  personal  bank  statements
    corresponding to the same period.  It is common  ground  that  none  of
    these documents were provided (and indeed they  could  not  have  been,
    because the sponsor had not been employed for the required period).

24. The interplay between the requirements under the Rules with  regard  to
    the evidence necessary to establish income from salaried employment and
    the provision within  Section  85(4)  of  the  2002  Act  allowing  the
    Tribunal to consider evidence about any matter which it thinks relevant
    to the substance of the decision, including evidence which  concerns  a
    matter arising after the date of the decision, is illustrated when  one
    considers this specific requirement.  The requirement under  the  Rules
    is for an applicant to provide evidence in the  form  set  out  in  the
    Rules.  In the case of salaried employment, this includes evidence such
    as wage slips covering a period "prior to  the  date  of  application".
    Under Section 85(4) an applicant could establish that this  requirement
    was satisfied by providing the wage slips covering  this  period  after
    the date of decision, but what a Tribunal cannot take into  account  is
    wage slips for a subsequent period  (or  any  period  other  than  that
    specified)  or  other  evidence  which  would   tend   to   show   that
    notwithstanding the failure  to  provide  the  specified  evidence,  an
    applicant nonetheless earned  the  sums  of  money  claimed.   This  is
    because the  specific  requirement  within  the  Rules  is  to  provide
    evidence in a specified form.  In this case, the  applicant  failed  to
    provide this evidence, and none of the evidence submitted  later  could
    cure the defect with regard to salaried employment.

25. With regard to the evidence which  has  to  be  provided  in  order  to
    satisfy the requirements of the Rules with regard  to  self-employment,
    although  it  is  not  specifically  provided  that  evidence  must  be
    submitted in respect of periods "prior to the application", nonetheless
    it is  clear  from  the  relevant  paragraphs  set  out  above  that  a
    considerable body of evidence must be provided.  The requirement  under
    paragraph 7(b) of Appendix FM-SE cannot be satisfied if  the  necessary
    evidence does not relate at the latest to the date of decision.  So the
    requirement for an annual  self-assessment  tax  return  to  HMRC  must
    require at the very least that this period ended  before  the  date  of
    decision.  It is arguable that the requirement is for  this  return  to
    cover the period before the date of application, but  on  any  view  it
    cannot sensibly be argued that an applicant can rely on evidence  which
    could not have been available as at the date of decision.

26. In this case, the sponsor did not even produce  accounts  covering  the
    whole year.  The accounts  he  provided  showed  a  taxable  income  of
    �12,800 for the period 1 August 2012 to 5 April 2013, a period of  just
    over eight months.  So he has not even produced evidence of one  year's
    income from self-employment exceeding the sum required.   Even  if  one
    was to assume that his income was  at  a  level  rate  throughout  this
    period, this would show an income to the date of  decision  from  self-
    employment of under �4,000 (only two months  and  thirteen  days  comes
    with this period).  If this were  sufficient,  then  theoretically,  an
    applicant could succeed in his claim by  commencing  self-employment  a
    mere week before the date of decision, and substantially after the date
    of application, if before the hearing he could  produce  some  accounts
    which showed he was earning at a pro rata rate above  �18,600  a  year.
    In this case, of course, at the time of application,  the  sponsor  had
    not even begun to work in a self-employed capacity.

27. Accordingly, in my judgment Judge Napthine was  not  entitled  to  take
    into account either the sums claimed in respect of  employment  or  the
    income claimed in respect of self-employment.  The income shown on  his
    later tax return of �7,350 from Middlesbrough  Food  supplies  was  not
    evidenced in the form required in the Rules,  and  Section  85(4)  only
    permits a Tribunal to  consider  evidence  which  is  relevant  to  the
    substance of the decision.  It does not permit a Tribunal  to  consider
    evidence which is not admissible  under  the  Rules.   Similarly,  with
    regard to income from self-employment, the later tax returns cannot  be
    taken into account either.  The judge was  no  doubt  correct  when  he
    found at paragraph 25 that "it is in the nature of self-employment that
    a person's income and his tax liability thereon  cannot  be  calculated
    until the end of the tax period" but that is  precisely  why  it  is  a
    requirement within the Rules that  evidence  of  consistent  income  be
    produced for a previous period.

28. Essentially, the judge erred in finding at paragraph 21 that  what  was
    required was that "the sponsor had to have an income of �18,600 at  the
    date of decision in order to satisfy the  requirements  of  E-ECP.3.1."
    What the claimant had to show was that the specific evidence  had  been
    provided in accordance with the Rules to establish that  this  was  the
    case.  It was not.

29. It follows that the appeal of the ECO must succeed.   Judge  Napthine's
    determination must be set aside and the decision re-made.

30. It is not necessary to hear further evidence in order  to  re-make  the
    decision.  As I have already found,  the  claimant  failed  to  provide
    sufficient  evidence  in  the  form  prescribed  within  the  Rules  to
    establish that the maintenance requirements were satisfied and  so  her
    appeal must fail under the Rules.

31. It has not been suggested before me that  the  claimant  could  succeed
    under Article 8 in the circumstances of this case where she has  failed
    under the Rules, and clearly she could not.  If and to the extent  that
    she  can  demonstrate  that  the  maintenance  requirements   are   now
    satisfied, there is no reason why the  claimant  should  not  submit  a
    fresh application, but it  she  will  have  to  provide  the  necessary
    evidence in  support  as  prescribed  within  Appendix  FM-SE.   Unless
    circumstances change, there is  no  apparent  reason  why  the  judge's
    findings with regard to the other requirements under the  Rules  should
    not be maintained.



Decision

I set aside the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal  as  containing  a
material error of law and substitute the following decision:

The claimant's appeal against the decision of the  respondent  refusing  her
entry clearance is dismissed.
