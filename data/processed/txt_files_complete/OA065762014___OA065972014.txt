                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr F Latta, of Latta & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwyncz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1.  The  appellants  appeal  against  a  decision  by  FtT  Judge   Doyle,
    promulgated on 5 July 2016, dismissing their appeals against refusal of
    entry clearance.

 2. The case has a long history.  In view of the way the matter  eventually
    unfolded before us, there is no need  to  go  into  full  detail.   The
    responsibility for delay is shared, and although  unfortunate,  is  not
    blameworthy, apart from one aspect.   A  document  verification  report
    (DVR) was not available at the time of the ECO's original decisions  on
    the applications of the two appellants, refused as long ago as February
    2013, but was available by the time their  appeals  came  before  Judge
    Bell.  The DVR was not made available to him.  He allowed  the  appeals
    by a decision promulgated on 31 December 2013.  The DVR was  then  used
    to make further adverse decisions, for new reasons, and was produced in
    the subsequent further appeals.  If it had been produced when it should
    have been, a great deal of delay and confusion would have been avoided.

 3. Grounds 1 and 2 of the appeal to the UT  are  concerned  with  relating
    evidence to  dates,  the  admissibility  of  the  DVR,  and  Devaseelan
    principles.  These grounds are misconceived.  The Judge's references to
    relevant dates (application or decision) are muddled, but  not  in  any
    way which makes a difference to  the  outcome.   There  is  nothing  in
    Devaseelan  which  demonstrates  error.   The  DVR  was  admissible  in
    evidence, and the Judge had to decide whether it  constituted  evidence
    which undermined the decision of Judge Bell.

 4. The respondent's rule 24 response concedes  and  Mr  Diwyncz  confirmed
    that ground 3 shows error of law.

 5. The Judge found at ï¿½10 (e) and  (f)  that  the  DVR  was  difficult  to
    follow, and not clear evidence of forgery or dishonesty,  but  that  it
    did show that the documents produced by the  appellants  could  not  be
    relied upon.  The error of law is absence or inadequacy of reasons  for
    that conclusion.

 6. To remake the decision, Mr Latta and Mr Diwyncz took us  on  a  helpful
    examination of the DVR and the  financial  documents.   The  DVR  is  a
    careful document, the result of close scrutiny  of  the  documents  and
    transcripts of conversations, but it does not justify its assertion  at
    page 1, "Employment Verification: False".  It  discloses  discrepancies
    between what was said by the first appellant and by Wang  Huiping,  her
    sister and business associate, but no more  than  minor  muddle  rather
    than fraudulence, and nothing to displace the conclusion of Judge  Bell
    that the financial requirements of the rules had been met.  Mr  Diwyncz
    did not dissent from that final analysis.

 7. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, and the following
    decision is substituted: the appeals, as originally brought to the FtT,
    are allowed.

 8. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
