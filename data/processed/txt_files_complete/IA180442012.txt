Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tufan, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against the decision  by  the
    Secretary of State to refuse to issue her  with  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of her right to reside in the United Kingdom as the spouse
    of an EEA national  exercising  treaty  rights  here.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal did not make an anonymity order, and I do  not  consider  that
    such an order is required for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Somalia, whose date  of  birth  is  21st
    October 1970.  She lives in the United  Kingdom  with  her  husband,  a
    Norwegian national, and they have five dependent children  whose  dates
    of birth range from 1 July 1996  to  11  July  2007.   Her  husband  is
    Abdullahi Omar Hassan.  He was born on 3 December 1946 in Somalia,  and
    he  subsequently  acquired  Norwegian  citizenship.   He   obtained   a
    registration certificate in the UK on 18 May 2010.   In  January  2012,
    the appellant applied with her five dependent  children  for  residence
    cards.

 3. On 16 July 2012 the Secretary of State gave her  reasons  for  refusing
    the applications.  As evidence of her husband exercising treaty rights,
    the appellant had provided four pay slips from Sorag Carers and Special
    Needs for the period 26 September to 19 December  2010;  and  four  pay
    slips from  Towfiq  Money  Transfer  and  Telecom  for  the  period  30
    September 2011 to 30 December 2011.

 4. According to the stamp in the application form,  her  EEA  sponsor  was
    employed by Towfiq Money Transfer and Telecom earning �389  per  month.
    It was claimed that this employment had commenced on 1 September  2011.
    The department of the Home Office dealing with  her  application  ("the
    department") did not consider that a family of seven could subsist on a
    monthly income of �389 without recourse to the social assistance system
    of the United Kingdom.

 5. On the morning of 10  July  2012,  the  department  tried  on  numerous
    occasions to telephone Towfiq on the number quoted  on  the  employer's
    stamp in the application.  For several hours the phone calls rang  out.
    The phone was eventually answered, not in a  professional  businesslike
    manner, but simply by a  hello.   When  asked  what  the  name  of  the
    business  was  the  gentleman  confirmed  that  it  was  Towfiq.    The
    department asked to speak to the manager, but was told that he was  not
    available.  When asked when he would be available, the  department  was
    told next week.

 6. The department had telephoned Sorag Carers and Special  Needs  and  had
    established the sponsor had left this employment in August 2011.

 7. On 16 July 2012 another telephone call was made to  Towfiq.   The  call
    was transferred to a mobile telephone.  The department asked  to  speak
    to the manager, being the person named on the  application  form.   But
    the department was told he was unavailable.  When asked when  he  would
    be available, they were told next week.   Accordingly,  the  department
    had been unable to confirm her EEA sponsor's employment status.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 8. The appellant's appeal came before Judge Ievins sitting at Taylor House
    in the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  11  July  2014.   In  his  subsequent
    determination, he explained there was only one appellant before him  as
    only one appellant had completed a notice of appeal.   The  immigration
    status of each child stood or fell with that of  their  mother,  so  he
    proposed to treat  the  five  dependent  children  as  the  appellant's
    dependants for the purposes of the appeal.

 9. In paragraph [6], he  rehearsed  the  documentary  evidence  which  was
    before him.  This included two original pay slips dated 31 May  and  30
    June 2014 from the husband's alleged  employer  Towfiq.   He  had  also
    taken into account remarks made by the two  advocates  at  the  hearing
    about telephone calls that they had made, separately, on the day of the
    hearing to HMRC.

10. The judge received oral evidence from the appellant,  who  was  legally
    represented, and from the sponsor.  The appellant  explained  that  she
    entered the United Kingdom on  15  October  2010,  her  husband  having
    applied for family reunion for her.  She travelled from Ethiopia to the
    United Kingdom with her husband and the five dependent children.

11. He understood from Mr Whitehead, who appeared on  behalf  of  the  Home
    Office, that he had telephoned HMRC on the day of the hearing, and  had
    received the  information  that  so  far  as  HMRC  was  concerned  the
    sponsor's last  employment  was  in  February  2013.   Mr  Yussuf,  who
    appeared on behalf of the appellant, said that he had  also  telephoned
    HMRC on the day of the hearing.  A man called Sam told Mr  Yussuf  that
    an application for working tax credit and child  tax  credit  had  been
    submitted in April 2010.

12. Both the appellant and the sponsor were cross-examined on the topic  of
    whether the sponsor was genuinely working for Towfiq.  The sponsor said
    he worked sixteen hours a week, the hourly rate of pay being �6.31  per
    hour.

13. In his closing submissions on behalf of the  respondent,  Mr  Whitehead
    submitted that the appellant had not discharged the  burden  of  proof.
    He relied on the information that he had received in his telephone call
    to HMRC.  Also, there was no evidence of wages or money received by the
    sponsor in the period 2013 to date.  Conversely, there was evidence  of
    the sponsor earning �4,312 in the period 2012 to 2013.

14. In reply,  Mr  Yussuf  submitted  there  were  a  number  of  different
    documents and the Home Office had not challenged  the  authenticity  of
    the pay slips or whether the  company  existed.   The  bank  statements
    showed that up until June 2014 the sponsor was  receiving  working  tax
    credit and child tax credit and unless HMRC was satisfied at  the  time
    of renewal that the sponsor had provided evidence  of  his  employment,
    those payments would not have been made.

15. The judge's discussion of the evidence is to be found at paragraph [25]
    onwards.  The sponsor's evidence appeared to be that he  was  sometimes
    paid weekly and sometimes monthly.  He could not explain why two of his
    pay slips showed that he was paid by BACS whereas his case was that  he
    was paid in cash; nor could  he  explain  why  the  word  transfer  was
    misspelt on the pay slips.

16. The point of a pay slip is to provide an accurate record  of  how  much
    someone was paid and when and how the payment was calculated.   It  was
    not at all helpful therefore  as  the  pay  slips  did  not  accurately
    reflect the sums paid or the frequency of payment.  The judge  went  on
    to address in some detail the discrepancy which he  had  noted  between
    the pay slip of 31 May 2014 and the pay slip for 30 June 2014.

17. The judge addressed Mr Yussuf's case that the sponsor must be  in  work
    because he had been awarded working tax credit and  child  tax  credit.
    There was a flat contradiction between what the two advocates had  told
    him.  The judge acknowledged that the sponsor was receiving tax credit.
     His bank statements showed, for example, that on 29 May and on 5  June
    2014 he had received two payments of �401.21  by  way  of  working  and
    child tax credit.  The judge continued at paragraph [30] as follows:

         I do not know what checks HMRC carry out to satisfy themselves that
         someone is working before they allow a tax credit claim.  It  seems
         that the sponsor sent some pay  slips  in.   Are  those  pay  slips
         accepted at face value?  I do not know.  Although the  sponsor  is,
         it seems, currently receiving tax credits I do not know whether  he
         should be receiving them or not.  Is he really working?

18. The judge went on to express considerable doubt about the  authenticity
    of the pay slips.  The Home Office  had  difficulty  contacting  Towfiq
    when they telephoned back in  2012.   There  was  a  careless  spelling
    mistake on the pay slips.  Some of the pay  slips  said  that  payments
    were made by BACS whereas the appellant's case was that they were  not.
    The pay slips did not  seem  to  match  with  the  frequency  that  the
    appellant was paid.

19. The judge  stated  his  conclusion  at  paragraph  [33].   He  was  not
    satisfied on the evidence before him that the sponsor was  working  for
    Towfiq, and his case was that he was not working anywhere else.  He did
    not  consider  he  had  a  full  picture  of  the  sponsor's  financial
    circumstances.  He was not satisfied the sponsor was exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom as a  worker.   He  dismissed  the  appeal
    under  Regulation  6  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic   Area)
    Regulations 2006.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

20. On 5 August 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge P  J  G  White  granted  the
    appellant permission to appeal.  It was arguable that in  reaching  his
    decision the FTT Judge was improperly influenced by the evidence  given
    by the respondent's representative concerning a telephone  conversation
    between the representative and HMRC to the effect that no  working  tax
    credit  had  been  claimed  after  February  2013,  whereas  the  judge
    acknowledged that  there  was  documentary  evidence  produced  by  the
    appellant showing the receipt of working tax credit up  to  June  2014.
    It was also arguable that the judge's doubts  concerning  whether  HMRC
    checked on whether an applicant who  claimed  working  tax  credit  was
    actually working was without reasonable foundation, given that HMRC  in
    addition to administering working tax  credit,  administered  PAYE  and
    national insurance of employees.

The Rule 24 Response

21. On 14 August 2014 John Parkinson of the Specialist Appeals Team settled
    a Rule 24 response on behalf of the Secretary of State.  The judge  had
    listed clear problems with the evidence relied upon to demonstrate  the
    sponsor was exercising treaty rights in the UK.   It  was  clear  there
    were a number of errors of concern and the judge was fully entitled  to
    take them against the appellant.  The grounds were  a  disagreement  on
    findings open to the judge, and were an attempt to re-argue the case.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

22. At the hearing before me, Mr Chellah developed the arguments raised  in
    the grounds of appeal, and Mr Tufan took the same line as that taken by
    Mr Parkinson in the Rule 24 response.

Discussion

23. It would have been an error of law for the judge not to have taken  any
    account of the hearsay evidence which he had received from Mr Whitehead
    on the day of the hearing.  The weight which the judge attached to this
    piece of hearsay evidence was a matter for him, although of  course  he
    had to assess its probative  value  in  the  light  of  all  the  other
    evidence that was before him.   It  clear  from  the  judge's  line  of
    reasoning that  he  was  not  improperly  influenced  by  this  hearsay
    evidence.  He treated the hearsay evidence from Mr Whitehead  as  being
    neutralised by the contradictory hearsay evidence from Mr Yussuf.    In
    the end, the judge based his conclusion on the pay slips,  not  on  the
    hearsay evidence from Mr Whitehead.

24. I turn to consider whether it was perverse of the judge  not  to  treat
    the documentary evidence of the sponsor receiving working tax credit as
    discharging the burden of proof.  The argument  for  the  appellant  is
    that HMRC would not be awarding the sponsor working tax credit if  HMRC
    was not satisfied that he was working in the first place.

25. The judge recognised the force of this argument, and he did not  ignore
    it.  He addressed it in paragraph [30].  The judge's reasoning was that
    HMRC might erroneously be paying working tax credit to the sponsor, and
    this is what he eventually concluded by necessary implication.

26. I consider it was open to the  judge  not  to  treat  the  evidence  of
    ongoing payments of working tax credit as being  determinative  of  the
    issue which he had to decide.  The ultimate question  was  whether  the
    sponsor was exercising treaty rights at the day of the hearing.   While
    the receipt of working tax credit was supportive of the sponsor's case,
    it did not necessarily follow that the sponsor was in fact working.  On
    analysis, all it showed is that when the decision was made to award the
    sponsor working tax credit sometime in the past, at that juncture  HMRC
    was satisfied on the documentary evidence provided  that  he  qualified
    for the award of working tax credit.

27. As the sponsor pointed out in the course  of  his  oral  evidence,  his
    earnings from his claimed employment with Towfiq fell below the  income
    tax and national insurance thresholds.   So  Towfiq  did  not  have  to
    account to HMRC for any income tax or national insurance  arising  from
    the  sponsor's  claimed  employment.   So  the  fact  that  HMRC   also
    administers PAYE is nothing to the point. For in this  particular  case
    HMRC was not collecting any income tax or national insurance  from  the
    sponsor's claimed employer.  Put another way, HMRC would  be  none  the
    wiser if the sponsor was receiving zero cash each month, as opposed  to
    �389.

28. In summary, I find that the conclusion reached by  the  judge  was  one
    that was reasonably open to him for the reasons which he gave.

Conclusion

29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not  contain  an  error  of
    law, and accordingly the decision stands.  This  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.
