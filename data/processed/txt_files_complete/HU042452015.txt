                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. For the purpose of continuity with the determination in  the  First-
       tier Tribunal I will hereinafter refer to the Secretary of State  as
       the Respondent and Mr Khan as the Appellant.  I  make  no  anonymity
       order it was not applied for and does not appear to be necessary.


    2. The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
       remain as a spouse on 31 July 2015.  His  appeal  against  this  was
       allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kempton ("the  Judge")  outside
       the Rules following a hearing on 15 March 2016.


The Judge's findings

    3. In summary the Judge found that  it  would  be  disproportionate  to
       require the family to leave the United Kingdom as [16] the Appellant
       and   his   wife   have   undergone   considerable   treatment   and
       investigations in relation  to  infertility  and  that  this  is  an
       ongoing matter with the sponsor possibly being considered for a womb
       transplant.  She has lived  here  all  her  life,  works  here,  has
       immediate family and a support network here, and it would be  better
       if she could stay working as a teaching  assistant.  He  has  worked
       here [17].

The grant of permission


    4. Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin  granted  permission  to  appeal  (30
       September 2016) as the Judge failed to consider whether  there  were
       insurmountable obstacles to family life under the Rules  and  failed
       to take this into account under Article 8 outside of the Rules,  and
       made no reference in the reasons to s117B  of  the  Immigration  and
       Nationality Act 2002.


Respondent's position

    5. There was no consideration of life in Pakistan, or why it  would  be
       so problematic for them not to relocate there, or why he  could  not
       apply from abroad with  them  either  relocating  there  temporarily
       while he did so or were briefly separated.


Appellant's position


    6. There would be problems in Pakistan and they can  give  and  produce
       evidence about that. They were  not  asked  about  any  problems  in
       Pakistan at the hearing.


Discussion

    7. The Judge quoted extensively from the Rules for 3 ï¿½  pages  [9]  and
       set out EX2 of Appendix FM and S117B. She did not however  refer  to
       any part of either in the reasons section of her decision.  She  has
       not explained what very significant difficulties they would face  in
       continuing family life in Pakistan,  why  for  example  the  sponsor
       could not work there or have fertility treatment there,  or  why  he
       could not work there or what support network they would both have in
       Pakistan to ameliorate any potential problems, it  being  remembered
       that he only came in August 2012  when  he  was  24.  There  was  no
       consideration to why he could not simply reapply from  Pakistan.  In
       not  considering  any  of  the  relevant  matters,  the  Judge   has
       materially erred.

    8. I am therefore satisfied that the Judge made  a  material  error  of
       law.


   9. Having heard submissions, I decided to remit the matter to the  First-
      tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing with no findings  preserved  as  the
      Appellant is entitled to obtain the evidence to support his claim, and
      the Respondent is entitled to consider that prior to the hearing,  and
      these matters have not been considered at all.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

    I remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal sitting in Bradford to be
    heard afresh by a Judge other than Judge Kempton.
