                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

      1. This is an 'error of law' decision  determined  without  a  hearing
         pursuant to rule 34 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008, paragraph 4 of  the  Practice  Direction  made  by  the
         Senior  President   of   Tribunals:   Pilot   Practice   Direction:
         Contingency arrangements in the First-tier Tribunal and  the  Upper
         Tribunal on 19 March 2020, and the Presidential Guidance Note No  1
         2020: Arrangements During the Covid-19 Pandemic, as amended  on  19
         November 2020.


      2. The appellant appeals against the decision of Judge of  the  First-
         tier Tribunal Suffield-Thompson ("the judge") who,  in  a  decision
         promulgated on 11 November 2019 (although amended on 13 March  2020
         under rule 31  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)
         (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules 2014), dismissed her  appeal
         against a decision by the respondent dated 28 March  2019  refusing
         her asylum claim (although  granting  her  Discretionary  Leave  to
         Remain).

      3. The appellant, a national  of  the  Ivory  Coast,  claims  to  have
         arrived in the UK on 2 October 2017 and made her asylum  claim  the
         following day. The appellant claimed to be at risk  of  persecution
         as a result of domestic  abuse  and  of  gender-based  violence  if
         returned as a lone woman. She feared in particular her husband  and
         her father.  Because  no  marriage  certificate  was  provided  and
         because the appellant had only limited knowledge about her  husband
         the respondent did not accept that the appellant had  been  legally
         married or that she faced any risk of ill treatment. The respondent
         considered  that  the  appellant  could  obtain  a  sufficiency  of
         protection from the state authorities or that she could  internally
         relocate. The appellant appealed the respondent's decision  to  the
         First-tier  Tribunal  pursuant  to   s.82   of   the   Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


      4. The judge had before her a bundle  of  documents  prepared  by  the
         appellant's representatives that contained, inter-alia, two witness
         statements from the appellant, a  medico-legal  report  from  Dr  T
         Longman, a psychiatric report by Dr A Battersby, medical and social
         services evidence relating to the appellant's child (who has  spina
         bifida) and an country expert  report  on  domestic  violence.  The
         judge indicated that she treated  the  appellant  as  a  vulnerable
         witness and heard oral evidence from her.

      5. At [26] the judge indicated that the "key disputed matter" was  the
         appellant's credibility, and at [28] the judge set out the areas of
         dispute that included whether the appellant had a  subjective  fear
         of her husband and father, and whether  she  was  afraid  that  her
         daughter would be subjected to FGM. At [29] the judge  again  found
         that the case depended on whether the appellant was credible.

      6. At [30] and [31] the judge drew adverse inferences  based  on  what
         she considered to  be  inconsistent  evidence  relating  to  police
         summons (whether the appellant had given her husband  the  summons)
         and whether she had gone to the police after being  beaten  by  her
         husband.  At  [32]  the  judge  did  not  accept  that  the   vague
         information given by the appellant  relating  to  her  husband  was
         consistent with her level of education  given  that  she  had  been
         married to him for 2 ï¿½ years. The judge found  that  the  appellant
         could have complained to the police about  her  husband's  polygamy
         [33] and she rejected the  appellant's  evidence  that  her  father
         would find her given that the appellant's  oldest  child,  who  was
         living with a friend in a village, had not been located [34].

      7. At [37] to [39] the judge considered the psychiatric report  of  Dr
         Battersby and accepted that Dr Battersby  was  an  expert  for  the
         purposes of the proceedings. The judge was not satisfied that there
         was anything other than the word of  the  appellant  that  domestic
         violence had contributed to her diagnosis  of  mild  complex  PTSD,
         particularly bearing in mind that the appellant had left her oldest
         child with a friend, that  she  had  given  birth  to  a  seriously
         disabled child in the UK in respect of whom she was  struggling  to
         care, and that she had lost her mother in respect of whom  she  had
         been very close.

      8. Having then dealt with the scaring report by  Dr  Longman  and  the
         expert country report by Dr V Baudais, and having found implausible
         the appellant's explanation as to  how  her  trip  to  the  UK  was
         funded, the judge rejected the appellant's claim to be a victim  of
         domestic violence. Indeed, the judge  found  there  was  inadequate
         evidence that the  appellant  had  ever  been  married.  The  judge
         rejected the appellant's claim to be in  fear  of  her  father  and
         found that she could return to her family in the  Ivory  Coast  and
         receive their support. The  judge  then  rejected  the  appellant's
         claim that she feared that her youngest child would be subjected to
         FGM. The appeal was dismissed.

      9. The grounds of appeal contend that the  judge  failed  to  properly
         apply the vulnerable witness guidance  in  her  assessment  of  the
         appellant's credibility, with specific reference to what the  judge
         found to be inconsistent evidence relating to the  police  summons.
         The grounds further content that the judge failed to  consider  the
         evidence before her in a  holistic  manner  including  the  country
         expert evidence and the Medico-Legal Report by Dr Longman.


     10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  granted  by  Upper
         Tribunal Judge Sheridan in a decision dated  28  January  2021  but
         sent on 8 February 2021. I set out the  material  elements  of  the
         grant of permission:

             "It is not arguable that, when assessing  the  credibility  of
             the appellant's account, the judge failed to have  had  regard
             to her low level of education, as this is explicitly  referred
             to in the second sentence of  paragraph  32.  However,  it  is
             arguable that the judge failed to take into consideration that
             the evidence of Dr Battersby was not merely that the appellant
             has a low level of education and is vulnerable, but  that  her
             profound lack of education  makes  it  difficult  for  her  to
             understand normal conversations (see page 11 of  the  report).
             It is arguable that this  explains,  at  least  in  part,  the
             apparent inconsistencies described in paragraphs 30 and 31 and
             the vagueness described in paragraph 32.


             Permission is granted on all grounds."

     11. In a Rule 24 response dated 15 February 2021 the respondent stated:

             "The respondent does not oppose  the  appellant's  application
             for permission to appeal and invites the Tribunal to remit the
             appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing."

     12. In directions dated  9  February  2021  but  issued  by  the  Upper
         Tribunal on 12 March 2021 Upper Tribunal  Judge  Pitt  reached  the
         provisional view that it would be appropriate to determine  whether
         the First-tier Tribunal's decision involved the making of an  error
         of law, and, if so, whether that  decision  should  be  set  aside,
         without a hearing. On 22 March 2021  the  respondent  responded  to
         Judge Pitt's  directions  noting  once  again  that  there  was  no
         challenge to the appellant's appeal and that the matter  should  be
         remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing,  and  that
         an 'error of law'  hearing  was  therefore  not  necessary  in  the
         circumstances.


     13. Having regard to the overriding interest in rule 2 of the  Tribunal
         Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to deal with cases justly and
         fairly,  and  having  considered  the  nature  and  focus  of   the
         appellant's challenge to the judge's decision, and having satisfied
         myself that both parties have been  given  a  fair  opportunity  of
         fully advancing their cases, and having regard to the  judgment  in
         JCWI v President of the Upper Tribunal [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin),  I
         consider it appropriate, in light  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  to
         determine the questions (i) whether the judge's  decision  involved
         the making of an error of law and, if so, (ii) whether the decision
         should be set aside, without a hearing pursuant to rule 34  of  the
         Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.

Discussion

     14. For the reasons succinctly expressed by Judge Sheridan in  granting
         permission to appeal, I am persuaded that the judge  has  erred  in
         law by failing  to  adequately  take  into  account  the  otherwise
         unchallenged psychiatric report of Dr Battersby. In her  report  Dr
         Battersby found that the appellant was "... not likely to have  any
         learning disability but does have a profound lack of education that
         will make it difficult for her to understand normal conversations."
         As was accepted by the respondent, it is entirely  unclear  whether
         the judge adequately factored  in  this  material  element  of  the
         psychiatric report. I am satisfied that,  had  the  judge  properly
         considered the psychiatric report, she may have reached a different
         conclusion in respect of the appellant's credibility.


     15. I find for the reasons given that the decision contains mistakes on
         points of law that require it to be set aside.

     16. Under Part 3  paragraph  7.2(b)  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Practice
         Statement of the 18 June 2018 a case may be remitted to the  First-
         tier Tribunal if the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:

               a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before
                  the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  a  fair  hearing  or  other
                  opportunity for  that  party's  case  to  be  put  to  and
                  considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or


               b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
                  necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-
                  made  is  such  that,  having  regard  to  the  overriding
                  objective in rule 2, it is appropriate to remit  the  case
                  to the First-tier Tribunal.

      1. I have determined that the judge failed to assess material evidence
         when considering the appellant's credibility. The  appeal  will  be
         remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  so  that  a  new  fact-finding
         exercise can be undertaken. It will be for the First-tier  Tribunal
         to determine the most appropriate mode of hearing the appeal.


Notice of Decision

The making of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  involved  the  making  of
errors on points of law and is set aside.

The case is remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal to  be  decided  afresh
by a judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Suffield-Thompson.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  respondent  in
this appeal is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall
directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.  This
direction applies both to the appellant and to the  respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
