                                  JUDGMENT

                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

      The application


        1) The applicant applied on 16 January 2019 for judicial review of,
           and interim relief from, the respondent's decision of 17 October
           2018, (the  'Decision').  The  Decision  was  an  administrative
           review decision maintaining the previous refusal on 11 September
           2018, of the applicant's application for entry  clearance  as  a
           business person under the EC Association Agreement ('ECAA'). The
           applicant, a Turkish national, challenged the Decision  on  four
           grounds.


       Grounds


        2) Ground (1) was that in reaching her Decision, the respondent had
           breached the common law duty of fairness. She  had  done  so  by
           failing to follow up, for the purposes of clarification, in  the
           event that  she  had  concerns  about  the  genuineness  of  the
           applicant's business proposals. This was  by  analogy  with  the
           cases of R (Anjum v  ECO  (Islamabad  (entrepreneur  -  business
           expansion - fairness generally) [2017] UKUT 00406  (IAC)  and  R
           (Mushtaq) v SSHD, Pakistan (ECO -  procedural  fairness)  [2015]
           UKUT 0024.

        3) Ground (2) was that the respondent's Home Office Guidance  dated
           16 March 2018, which included consideration of  the  genuineness
           of  an  enterprise  by  reference  to  a   person's   particular
           qualifications (for example at page [63]) was  not  required  in
           the Immigration Rules.  The  Guidance  amounted  to  a  stricter
           standard than for  non-Turkish  applicants,  in  breach  of  the
           'standstill clause' (article 41) of the Additional  Protocol  of
           the Ankara Agreement.

        4) Ground (3) was that in reaching the Decision, the respondent had
           failed to apply the March  2018  Guidance,  when  rejecting  the
           application on  the  basis  that  the  applicant  would  not  be
           'bringing in money of his own' into  the  UK  to  establish  his
           business.  The Guidance accepted as legitimate funds  which  had
           been loaned. This was subject  to  certain  provisos:  that  the
           source was legitimate, was under the business person's  control,
           and could not be recalled at short-notice.  The  Decision  erred
           in imposing the additional requirement of the  earlier  physical
           transfer of funds by the applicant to his brother-in-law, who in
           turn returned the money to him.

        5) Ground (4) was that  the  respondent  should  have  granted  the
           applicant an in-country right of appeal, and that the  Court  of
           Appeal's decision in  SSHD v CA (Turkey) [2018]  EWCA  Civ  2875
           was wrong.  Permission to appeal in that case was  being  sought
           to the Supreme Court.

        6) In seeking permission, the applicant seeks orders  quashing  the
           respondent's  original  refusal  of  entry  clearance  and   the
           Decision; and a mandatory order requiring  that  the  respondent
           reconsiders both decisions.

       Upper Tribunal permission


         7)  On  1  May  2019,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Lindsley    granted
            permission  on the papers for the  applicant's  application  to
            proceed, on grounds (1) to (3), but not on ground (4),  on  the
            basis that no appeal was made following the Court  of  Appeal's
            decision in SSHD v CA (Turkey).


         The basis of the respondent's resistance to the orders sought


        8) The  respondent  served  an  Acknowledgment  of  Service  on  15
           February 2019 and detailed Grounds of Defence on 5 June 2019.


        9) In relation to ground (1), the respondent disputed that she  had
           a general duty to follow up on certain matters for the  purposes
           of clarification, explanation and elimination. In contrast,  the
           onus was on  the  applicant  to  demonstrate  that  he  met  the
           requirements of the relevant immigration rules, for which  there
           was a detailed guidance. Ground (1) essentially  amounted  to  a
           mere disagreement with the conclusion reached by the respondent.

       10) In relation to ground (2), the March 2018 Guidance  specifically
           confirmed at page [63] that experience and  qualifications  were
           not requirements of the ECAA rules. They should instead be taken
           into account as part of the overall assessment of  the  evidence
           provided. They were relevant to the  overall  assessment  of  an
           individual's ability to establish themselves  in  business.  The
           assertion that they  were  requirements  was  not  correct.  The
           respondent  concluded  that  the  applicant  was  not  genuinely
           intending to establish a business. She did so after  considering
           a  number  of  factors,  including  projected  profits,   likely
           competitors, and the  lack  of  research  and  experience.  That
           conclusion was open to her on the evidence before her and  there
           was no error on public law grounds.

       11) In relation to ground (3), the respondent was entitled  to  take
           into account that  the  applicant  had  failed  to  provide  any
           supporting documentation to show that he had been in  possession
           of �16,000 at the time he allegedly transferred the money to his
           brother-in-law some years earlier. The respondent noted that the
           applicant had been unemployed for almost a year prior to  making
           an application for entry clearance and had  a  bank  balance  of
           zero funds  since  March  2018.   The  respondent  was,  on  the
           evidence before her, entitled to be satisfied that  the  alleged
           funds were not available  to  the  applicant.  Once  again,  the
           ground  of  challenge  was  merely  a  disagreement   with   the
           conclusion reached and there was no error on public law grounds.

       12) In relation to ground (4), on the question of challenge based on
           an in-country right of appeal, this had now been resolved by the
           case of CA (Turkey) referred to above.




         Legal Framework


       13) Mr G Dingley confirmed at the beginning of the hearing that  the
           applicant did not pursue ground (4).


       14) Paragraph [31] of HC509 (the Immigration Rules in force in 1973,
           which apply here) provides:

               "For an applicant to  obtain  an  entry  clearance  for  this
           purpose  he  will  need  to  show,  if  joining  an  established
           business, that he will be bringing money of his own to put  into
           the business; that he will be able to  bear  his  share  of  the
           liabilities; that his share of the profits will be sufficient to
           support him  and  his  dependants;  that  he  will  be  actively
           concerned in the running of the business; and that  there  is  a
           genuine need for his services and investment.  The  accounts  of
           the business for previous years will require to be produced,  in
           order to establish the  precise  financial  position.  An  entry
           clearance will not be issued where it appears that the  proposed
           partnership or directorship amounts to disguised  employment  or
           where  it  seems  likely  that,  to  obtain  a  livelihood,  the
           applicant will have to supplement  his  business  activities  by
           employment for which a work permit is required."


       15) The relevant parts of the 'stand-still' provision (Article 41 of
           the Additional Protocol dated  1972  to  the  Ankara  Agreement)
           provide as follows:-


           "1. The  contracting  parties  shall  refrain  from  introducing
           between themselves  any  new  restrictions  on  the  freedom  of
           establishing and the freedom to provide services."


       16) Article 59 goes on to state:


           "In the fields covered by this Protocol Turkey shall not receive
           more favourable treatment than that which Member States grant to
           one another pursuant to the Treaty establishing the Community."


       17) The relevant passages  of  the  respondent's  March  2018  'ECCA
           business guidance' document, at pages  [49]  and  [63],  are  as
           follows:


           [49]
           "Evidence the funds or assets belong to the applicant


           This page tells you about  what  type  of  documents  should  be
           submitted to show that a person  applying  as  a  businessperson
           under the Turkish ECAA is devoting funds or assets of their  own
           to the business which can be invested on a long-term basis.


           While the 1973 rules do not specify the types of documents to be
           submitted in support  of  a  business  application,  caseworkers
           should  assess  whether  failure  to  provide  relevant   and/or
           requested  documents   undermines   the   credibility   of   the
           applicant's business proposal.


           Evidence the funds or assets belong to the applicant


           Applicants should be able to provide sufficient evidence to show
           that:
           .the source of the funds is legitimate
           .the funds are under their own control
           .there is no possibility that  the  money  may  be  recalled  or
           withdrawn from the business at short notice.


           They should provide evidence  of  the  available  funding.  This
           should include original bank statements for the last  6  months.
           You may request a translation of those bank statements that  are
           not  in  English  as  necessary.  Additional  evidence  must  be
           provided to show the source of any unusual or irregular deposits
           into the applicant's account, such as:
           .transfers of funds from sources overseas
           .assets from the sale of land, gold or property overseas
           .gifts of  money  from  business  associates  and  close  family
           members


           You must convert  money  transfers  from  overseas  into  pounds
           sterling so they can be assessed. ...
           In all cases you must be  satisfied  enough  evidence  has  been
           provided to show the money has been gifted by an individual  who
           is financially able to make the gift, without the possibility of
           needing to recall the money at short notice.


           Gifts from a business associate are not acceptable.


           Applicants must show that the majority of funds to  be  invested
           are their own. Loans, either in the form of a business bank loan
           or from another source such as a family member, may form part of
           a funding package to set up in business but  they  must  not  be
           considered as assets belonging to the applicant.


           If they rely in part on a loan, they must  show  their  business
           will realistically make sufficient profit to be  able  to  repay
           the loan as well as to support the applicant and any dependants.
           You must refuse applications where a loan forms the  only  basis
           of investment."


           [63]
           "Evidence of experience and qualifications


           This  page  tells  you  about  how  a  person's  experience  and
           qualifications can be used in part to assess  their  ability  to
           establish in business or continue operating their business  when
           applying as a businessperson under the Turkish ECAA.


           Experience and qualifications are not requirements of  the  1973
           business rules but should be taken into account as part  of  the
           overall assessment of the evidence provided.


           You must examine this evidence in the context  of  the  proposed
           business, taking into  account  the  other  supporting  evidence
           provided. You must check the evidence  is  correct  and  genuine
           using  CRS  to  check  relevant  information  on  previous  visa
           applications.


           In some circumstances, common sense will  tell  you  it  may  be
           possible for the applicant  to  establish  in  business  without
           relevant experience or qualifications. In other circumstances, a
           lack of previous  experience  and/or  qualifications  may  be  a
           barrier to establishing a business. For example, it could extend
           the time taken to establish the business and slow  the  rate  of
           growth of the business in subsequent years.


           All businesspersons are expected to show they have  at  least  a
           basic  understanding  of  business  and   financial   management
           including cash-flow management.


           All  qualifications  must  be  recognised  in  the  UK  and   be
           acceptable for the purpose for which they are proposed. You must
           check the evidence is correct and genuine.

           Evidence of specific qualifications needed in some  trades  will
           strengthen the credibility of the application,  but  it  is  the
           applicant's responsibility alone to  make  sure  they  meet  any
           legal  requirements.  For  example,  self-employed  workers   in
           information technology (IT) trades and  accountants  may  choose
           not to register with  an  appropriate  professional  body,  even
           though this would strengthen the credibility of  an  application
           to establish in business."


       The applicant's submissions

       18) The applicant referred to the well-known authority of R  (Doody)
           v SSHD [1994] 1 AC 531 and in  particular  the  sixth  principle
           that a person is entitled to be informed of the gist of the case
           which he has to answer.  The applicant had not been afforded the
           opportunity  to  make  representations  in   response   to   the
           respondent's concerns about the business plan in advance of  her
           refusal, in  order  to  provide  clarification  on  it.   I  was
           referred to the authorities of Anjum and  Mushtaq.   While  they
           dealt with alternative aspects of the  Immigration  Rules,  both
           dealt with the issue of genuineness and in Anjum's case also the
           question of funding.  In Anjum's case there had been no  further
           probing, clarification or exploring the areas of concern.

       19) In relation to ground  (2),  the  applicant  explained  how  the
           Guidance  was  in  breach  of  the  Additional   Protocol.   The
           respondent had taken the March  2018  Guidance  and  applied  it
           rigidly so that it became a set  of  rules,  in  breach  of  the
           Additional  Protocol.   One  example  was  in  relation  to  the
           applicant's business plan. The applicant could  not  have  known
           that in producing the business plan, he  would  be  required  to
           explain the process by which he had carried  out  research  into
           competitors, which was one criticism of the plan.  In any event,
           the applicant had provided more information than required  under
           the 1973 Immigration Rules. In doing so, it appeared he had been
           criticised for trying to be helpful.

       20) Referring to paragraph [97] of the Supreme Court decision  of  R
           (Alvi) v SSHD [2012] UKSC 33, the Supreme Court had encouraged a
           degree of certainty to reduce the scope of legal challenges  and
           the key requirement in  the  Immigration  Rules  was  that  they
           should include all the provisions which set  out  the  criteria,
           which maybe or are determinative of an application for leave  to
           remain or enter.  That was exactly the case which applied  here,
           if for example, there was  a  specific  requirement  as  to  the
           format of business  plans.   There  was  no  requirement  for  a
           particular level of qualification or  experience  in  running  a
           business in order to satisfy the genuineness of a business.

       21) In terms of ground (3)  the  applicant  had  provided  both  the
           receipt at page [110] of the applicant's bundle  of  the  monies
           and also statutory declaration  from  his  relative  as  to  the
           applicant having originally sent money  to  him.   The  Guidance
           suggested that there had to be a  legitimate  source  of  funds,
           which were under the applicant's control. The Guidance  did  not
           stipulate the means by which he obtained those  monies.  Such  a
           requirement was in breach of the Additional Protocol.

       The respondent's submissions

       22) The two cases of Anjum and Mushtaq should  be  distinguished  as
           they both dealt with interviews, where  ambiguous  questions  or
           the record of those interviews was contested.  In  contrast,  in
           this application, there  was  no  interview.  Despite  his  ECAA
           application having been rejected, including because of  concerns
           about  his  business  plan,  the  applicant  had  not  made  any
           additional  submissions  about  the  business  plan.   This  was
           despite being allowed under the  Upper  Tribunal  directions  to
           adduce evidence  if  he  wished,  to  address  the  respondent's
           concerns, whether in relation to sales figures or his  financial
           sources.  He claimed  to  have  lacked  an  opportunity  to  put
           forward arguments that he would otherwise have done. He had  not
           identified what those arguments were.  This was not a case where
           there were very nuanced or unexpected points.  It was  incumbent
           on the applicant to say what he would otherwise  have  said  and
           why it would have made a difference, otherwise  the  application
           for judicial review should not succeed.

       23) In relation to ground (1) and the question  of  strict  criteria
           being applied, neither the 2018 Guidance nor the Decision in the
           case suggested anything  of  the  sort.  In  the  Decision,  the
           respondent had simply considered the evidence  as  a  whole  and
           explained why she was not satisfied.  The  specific  explanation
           or rationale of  the  Decision  had  been  misconstrued  as  the
           general application of strict criteria, which was not the  case.
           By way of example, the respondent had concerns about the lack of
           analysis by the applicant of potential competitors in the  local
           area.  Not every  business  needed  to  conduct  such  analysis.
           However, the applicant was planning to run  the  business  of  a
           local corner shop. He had  been  out  of  work  and  until  very
           recently had no funds.  In  this  context,  the  respondent  was
           entitled to consider the research that  he  had  completed  into
           competitors and the process by which he reached that.  The  onus
           was on  the  applicant  to  establish  the  genuineness  of  his
           business.  It was a matter  for  the  respondent's  judgment  in
           assessing the application and this was not a  statutory  appeal.
           The respondent had reached a properly reasoned decision.

       Discussion

       Ground (1) - duty of fairness

       24) As made clear in Doody and as the  representatives  agreed  with
           me, the common law duty of fairness is fact-specific and depends
           very much on particular circumstances.  The cases of  Anjum  and
           Mushtaq concerned interviews or  records  that  were  contested,
           unclear, or had not been properly considered. In such cases,  it
           may be incumbent on the respondent  to  identify  any  areas  of
           confusion prior to reaching a decision.  This case concerned  an
           application  made  with  detailed  paperwork,  in  response   to
           provision of detailed guidance by the respondent. I  accept  the
           primary submission that the burden is on the applicant in  cases
           such as this to satisfy the respondent as to the genuineness  of
           the business arrangement.

       25) I also accepted the force of Mr Anderson's submission  that  the
           applicant has not  identified  precisely  what  submissions  the
           applicant would otherwise have made,  prior  to  the  respondent
           reaching the Decision, which would have  swayed  that  Decision.
           By way of example, the applicant has not explained what he would
           have  said  in  relation  to  the  lack   of   analysis   around
           competitors,  which  weakened  the  credibility  of  the  income
           projections  and  led  the  respondent  to  conclude  that   the
           applicant did not have the level of expertise  that  meant  that
           the business was a genuine one.  In the specific  circumstances,
           the  respondent  was  not  under  a  duty  to  seek   additional
           clarification or discuss further  her  areas  of  concern.   The
           answer to the core issue raised in Doody is that  the  applicant
           knew the requirements he had to meet  when  applying  under  the
           ECAA, and the details in the March 2018  Guidance  provided  him
           with assistance in doing so.




       Ground (2) - the claim  of  additional  criteria  in  breach  of  the
       Additional Protocol of the Ankara Agreement

       26) In relation to ground (2), I do not accept that the  March  2018
           Guidance constitutes additional formal  criteria,  or  that  the
           respondent treated them as such  in  assessing  the  applicant's
           application. The Guidance is explicit that whilst the 1973 rules
           do  not  specify  types  of  documents  to  be  submitted,   the
           respondents'  caseworkers  should  assess  whether  failure   to
           provide  relevant  or   requested   documents   undermines   the
           credibility of a business proposal.  Page [63] of  the  Guidance
           explicitly states that experience  and  qualifications  are  not
           requirements of the 1973 rules but should be taken into  account
           as part of an overall assessment.  The  Guidance  adds  that  in
           some circumstances, common sense will tell an assessor  that  it
           would be possible for  an  applicant  to  establish  a  business
           without relevant experience or qualifications.   The  respondent
           carried out  her  assessment  of  the  applicant's  application,
           considering all of the material provided in the round. I do  not
           accept that in raising concerns about the  applicant's  business
           acumen, as demonstrated in his research  into  competitors,  the
           respondent was imposing an additional strict  rule.  Rather  the
           respondent was considering the  applicant's  situation  overall,
           noting his apparent impecuniosity, the potential concerns around
           the business's income projections, and the limited research into
           local competitors.

       27) This was not a statutory appeal  and  the  overall  question  is
           whether the respondent has  properly  turned  her  mind  to  the
           issues within the 1973 rules or has instead  imposed  additional
           requirements, in breach  of  the  standstill  provision  of  the
           Additional Protocol.   I  am  satisfied  that  in  reaching  the
           Decision, the respondent did not treat the Guidance as a set  of
           strict rules, which imposed a 'higher standard'  than  permitted
           for other EEA nationals. Rather the Guidance emphasises the need
           for a 'common-sense', holistic assessment on  the  narrow  issue
           identified in the 1973  rules  and  states  expressly  that  the
           examples by way of guidance given are just that - guidance,  not
           requirements of the 1973 rules.  I  conclude  that  neither  the
           Guidance nor  the  respondent's  explanation  for  the  Decision
           should  be  conflated  to  be  viewed  as  the   imposition   of
           additional,  higher  standards,  in  breach  of  the  Additional
           Protocol.

       Ground (3) - alleged failure to apply  the  March  2018  Guidance  in
       relation to the business investment

       28) The Guidance suggests that an applicant should be able  to  show
           that the funds intended for the business are  legitimate,  under
           their control, and there is no possibility that the money may be
           recalled or withdrawn from the  business  at  short  notice.   I
           conclude that the respondent was entitled to consider  the  full
           circumstances of why the applicant was being paid  monies  by  a
           relative, with which he invested in the business shortly  before
           the application, i.e. the sum of �16,000.  It raised the obvious
           question of whether the relative was investing in  the  business
           rather than the applicant himself.    The source of funding  was
           part  of  the  wider  concerns  about  the  genuineness  of  the
           applicant's business.  The respondent's rationale did not impose
           an additional requirement that the applicant should evidence the
           transfer of monies many years earlier to the  relative.  Rather,
           the respondent was concerned, as the applicant appeared to  have
           no form of income immediately prior to  his  application.   That
           was an analysis that the respondent was entitled  to  carry  out
           and discloses no error of law on public law grounds.

       Conclusions

       29) For the  above  reasons,  I  conclude  that  the  Decision,  and
           critically, the process by  which  the  respondent  reached  the
           Decision,  cannot  be  impugned  on  public  law  grounds.   The
           respondent did not breach the common law duty  of  fairness.  In
           considering the Guidance, the respondent did not impose a set of
           higher standards in breach of the Additional Protocol.  Finally,
           the respondent did not ignore the Guidance when considering  the
           source of the investment in the applicant's business.

        dismissed.

        Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

     3) The parties have not sought permission to appeal to  the  Court  of
        Appeal. In any event, I refuse permission to appeal  for  the  same
        reasons that I have refused the orders sought for judicial review.


        Costs


     4) The applicant shall pay the respondent's reasonable  costs,  to  be
        assessed if not agreed.

       Notification of appeal rights


      A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review
      is a decision that disposes of proceedings.


       A party may appeal against such a decision to the Court of Appeal  on
      a question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to
      the Upper Tribunal  for  permission,  at  the  hearing  at  which  the
      decision is given. If  no  application  is  made,  the  Tribunal  must
      nonetheless  consider  at  the  hearing  whether  to  give  or  refuse
      permission to appeal (rule 44(4B) of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
      Tribunal) Rules 2008).


      If  the  Tribunal  refuses  permission,  either  in  response  to   an
      application or by virtue of rule 44(4B), then  the  party  wishing  to
      appeal can apply for permission from the Court of Appeal itself.  This
      must be done by filing an applicant's notice with  the  Civil  Appeals
      Office of the  Court  of  Appeal  within  28  days  of  the  date  the
      Tribunal's decision on permission to appeal was sent (Civil  Procedure
      Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).
