                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is an appeal brought by the Appellant  against  the  decision  of
    the First tier Tribunal (First tier Tribunal Judge O'Hagan),  heard  on
    31 of March 2015, and promulgated on 13 April 2015. The  Appellant  had
    appealed against the decision of an entry  clearance  officer  dated  3
    July 2014 to refuse her entry clearance under EC-P.1.1(d)  of  Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules for entry clearance to join her husband, Mr
    Reza Torabi ('the Sponsor').

2     The Appellant is a national of Iran born on 20 December  1974  and  39
    years old at the date of decision. The Sponsor was born on  16  October
    1951 and was 62 at that time. The Sponsor  is  a  British  national  of
    Iranian origin. They married in Iran on 21st of March 2013.

3     On or around 21 May 2014 the Appellant applied for entry clearance  to
    join the Sponsor in the UK. Prior to that she had in fact twice visited
    the Sponsor in the UK and had properly observed the conditions  of  her
    leave.

4     The Sponsor has autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,  and  is
    maintained on long-term regular haemodialysis. According  to  a  letter
    from  the  University  Hospital  Birmingham  dated  16   August   2013,
    summarised in an Entry Clearance  Manager's  decision  of  14  December
    2014, the Sponsor already had advanced kidney failure at  the  time  of
    the hospital letter in 2013.

5     On  3  July  2014  the  Respondent  made  a  decision  refusing  entry
    clearance to the Appellant on the grounds, in summary, that  there  was
    insufficient evidence to establish that the Appellant and Sponsor  were
    in a genuine and subsisting relationship, or that they intended to live
    together permanently in the United Kingdom, and that thus E-ECP 2.6 and
    2.10 of appendix FM were not met.  The entry clearance officer was also
    not  satisfied  that  the  documentary  evidence  provided   with   the
    application established that the appellant and Sponsor had available to
    them an income of at  least  �18,600  per  annum,  and  also  that  the
    evidence provided  did  not  satisfy  the  evidential  requirements  of
    Appendix FM SE.

6     The Appellant  appealed  against  that  decision,  the  appeal  coming
    before Judge O'Hagan. The Sponsor was present and gave evidence at  the
    hearing. The appeal was dismissed  for  reasons  contained  within  the
    decision dated 13 April 2015. Judge  O'Hagan  considered  the  evidence
    available about the existence of the relationship between the Appellant
    and Sponsor, and observed that the evidence was not as comprehensive as
    he would have expected in an appeal such as the present, but  gave  the
    Appellant the benefit of the doubt and proceeded on the basis that  the
    marriage was valid and subsisting  and  that  there  was  an  intention
    between the parties to live permanently together in the United  Kingdom
    [15].

7     However, in relation to  the  financial  eligibility  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, Judge O'Hagan found that the  Respondent  was  correct  in
    finding that the Sponsor's income was less than the  prescribed  amount
    at �18,600; nor  did  the  evidence  provided  satisfy  the  evidential
    requirements of Appendix FM SE.  He  dismissed  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

8     Judge O'Hagan then  proceeded  to  consider  whether  entry  clearance
    ought to have been granted outside of the immigration rules,  in  order
    to avoid a disproportionate and therefore  unlawful  interference  with
    the Appellant's right to family life Article  8  ECHR.   He  held  that
    family life was engaged in the present appeal, and the refusal of entry
    clearance to the Appellant would amount to an  interference  with  such
    family life.

9     He proceeded at [20]-[22] to consider whether the decision  to  refuse
    entry clearance  was  proportionate.  The  Judge  directed  himself  as
    follows at [20]:

         "I had to balance the public  interest  imperative  of  maintaining
         immigration control, weighty as that is, with the private interests
         of the Appellant."

    At [21], he held:

         "In weighing up the proportionality of the  Respondent's  decision,
         it seems to me  that  the  failure  to  meet  the  requirements  of
         Appendix FM SE was a significant consideration. I did not treat  it
         as being a determinative consideration. I recognised that there are
         cases in which countervailing factors that may exist which properly
         lead to the conclusion that the Article 8 considerations  overwhelm
         the normal importance of maintaining the integrity of the rules."

10    The judge held at [22] that:

         "I was not persuaded, having considered all of the circumstances of
         the present case, that the factors in playing  on  the  Appellant's
         side of the balance was such as to outweigh the importance attached
         to the maintenance of the integrity of the rules. The  only  factor
         that sets this case apart from other case(es) of this kind  is  the
         fact that the Sponsor is experiencing  significant  renal  problems
         such that he  is  on  dialysis.  That  is  I  accept,  a  difficult
         circumstance for the Sponsor. However, the medical evidence is that
         his condition is being managed through dialysis and that he is self-
         caring. Whilst I recognise that the  current  situation  cannot  be
         easy for him, I do not think it is sufficient in and of  itself  to
         outweigh the factors in support of the Respondent in the  balancing
         exercise. I am also mindful  of  the  fact  that  the  Respondent's
         decision does not mean that the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  must
         forever live apart. It is open to them to  renew  the  application,
         ensuring that they comply fully with the rules when they do so.  In
         the  event  that  the  Sponsor  begins  to  receive  the   personal
         independence payment (PIP), then he will no longer be  required  to
         satisfy the usual financial requirements of the rules."

11    The appeal was dismissed. The  Appellant  applied  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal in grounds dated 5 May 2015. These grounds
    are with respect are rather unfocused but we distill from them that the
    Appellant's challenge to the decision is that the Judge  erred  in  law
    in:

         (i)       misdirecting  himself  in   law   when   performing   the
             proportionality balancing exercise as set out  at  step  5  of
             Razgar  [2004] 3 All ER 821, by directing himself by reference
             to a passage at para 43 of Heritage, R(on the application  of)
             v SSHD and First-tier Tribunal (IJR) [2014] UKUT 441 (IAC), as
             follows:

                  "It is clear that even under pre-9 July 2012 case  law  on
                  Article 8, for an immigration decision to give rise  to  a
                  breach of a third country national's right to respect  for
                  family life, it would  be  necessary  to  show  compelling
                  circumstances, the expectation being  that  only  a  small
                  minority of cases would succeed: see Huang v Secretary  of
                  State for the Home Department [2007] UKHL 11";

         (ii)     giving weight to immaterial  matters,  having  given  more
             importance  to  the  immigration   rules   rather   than   the
             Appellant's right to family life: "Far  too  much  weight  has
             been given to the Appellant's partner's financial position and
             very less weight (sic) has been given to the disruption  which
             will result if the Appellant is refused and the effect it will
             have on both Appellant's and her partner's family life"; and

         (iii)    failing to consider the consequences of the Sponsor having
             to leave the United Kingdom  in  his  medical  state,  or  the
             period of time in making another application.

12    Permission was granted by Designated Judge the First tier Tribunal  JM
    Lewis, in a decision dated 22 June 2015. The  Judge  observes  that  at
    paragraph 20 to 22 of the decision, the FTT Judge:

         "... attaches significant weight to the fact that the Appellant was
         unable to comply with the immigration rules. That degree of  weight
         was inappropriate, because an article 8 proportionality  assessment
         does not replicate the provisions  of  the  immigration  rules  but
         moves outside them.  The  judge  discusses  the  Sponsor's  medical
         situation identifying it as the only factor setting this case apart
         from others. What the Judge does not do, however, is  to  identify,
         discuss  and  balance  all  of  the  factors  of  relevance  to   a
         proportionality assessment, including the statutory  considerations
         under section 117 of the 2002  Act.  This  omission  to  conduct  a
         balanced article 8 assessment is an arguable error of law."

    The hearing

13    We heard submissions  from  the  parties.  Mr  Ahmed,  for  Appellant,
    relied on the grounds of appeal and argued that the findings within the
    proportionality assessment had not been  adequate.  The  scope  of  the
    immigration rules was a relevant factor to take into account,  but  the
    FTTJ had to perform a full assessment of the merits of the  Appellant's
    rights under Article 8 ECHR. There was also a failure to have regard to
    the considerations set  out  in  s.l17B  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act  2002  ('NIAA  2002').  Mr  Ahmed  argued,  in  relation  to
    s.117B(3) NIAA  2002  that  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  were  clearly
    financially independent, the Sponsor  having  a  number  of  investment
    properties and receiving an income from them. He was obliged  to  agree
    with us however that no challenge had been made within the  grounds  of
    appeal to the FTTJ's decision that the Appellant did  not  satisfy  the
    financial eligibility requirements of Appendix FM, and also  that  even
    if no point adverse to an appellant arose in the context of s.117B NIAA
    2002, this did not result in a positive entitlement to leave  to  enter
    or remain in the United Kingdom.

14    Mr Ahmed made reference to paragraph 40 of SS (Congo)  v  SSHD  [2015]
    EWCA Civ 387 and argued that the Sponsor's health problems  represented
    the   necessary   'compelling   circumstances',   and   the   Sponsor's
    disabilities were not being  taken  into  account  by  the  immigration
    rules.

15    Mr Richards for the Respondent relied on the Rule 24 Response dated  1
    July 2015 and argued that the FTTJ's decision was sustainable  in  law.
    The Appellant's  non-satisfaction  of  the  immigration  rules  was  of
    significant relevance, and the FTTJ was entitled to  attach  weight  to
    that. Article 8 was not a mechanism to enable an appellant  to  succeed
    in  the  absence  of  exceptional   circumstances   rendering   refusal
    disproportionate. The Judge had not treated  that  non-satisfaction  as
    determinative - see decision, [21].  The  Judge  took  account  of  the
    Sponsor's health problems and directed himself in law appropriately  in
    relation to Part 5A of NIAA 2002 at [19].  The  FTTJ's  conclusion  was
    open to him on the facts before him, and the decision was sustainable.

    Discussion

16    We ruled at the hearing that there was no material  error  of  law  in
    the FTTJ's decision, which we uphold. Our reasons for doing so are  set
    out below.

17    The degree to which  a  failure  to  meet  the  immigration  rules  is
    relevant to the assessment of the proportionately of a refusal of entry
    clearance was the subject of recent detailed consideration in the  case
    of SS (Congo) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387. We understand  the  following
    points to have been made within the Court's single  judgment  (emphasis
    added):

         (i)      If  there  was  a  wide  gap  between  the  way  in  which
             immigration rules were framed, and  the  protection  that  was
             rightfully afforded under Article 8 ECHR, then  the  practical
             guidance from the rules as to public policy considerations  in
             a proportionality balancing exercised was reduced [17].

         (ii)     On the other hand, if the rules were fashioned  so  as  to
             strike an appropriate balance under Article  8,  and  any  gap
             between the rules and what Article 8 required was narrow,  the
             court will give weight to the Secretary of State's formulation
             of the Rules as an assessment of what public interest required
             [17].

         (iii)    Following MM v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  985,  there  will
             generally be no or only a relatively small gap between the new
             LTE Rules as promulgated by the Secretary  of  State  and  the
             requirements of Article 8 in individual cases, including those
             involving  Sponsors  who  are  British  citizens  or  refugees
             located in the United Kingdom [24]. Further,  outside  of  the
             context of precarious family life or deportation:  '...if  the
             Secretary of State has sought to formulate  Immigration  Rules
             to reflect a fair balance of interests under Article 8 in  the
             general run of cases falling  within  their  scope,  then,  as
             explained above, the Rules themselves will provide significant
             evidence about the  relevant  public  interest  considerations
             which should be brought into account when a court or  tribunal
             seeks to strike the proper balance of interests under  Article
             8 in making its own decision.' [32].

         (iv)     Where the immigration rules were not satisfied,  different
             types of cases required the presence of different  factors  to
             outweigh the public interest in the maintenance of immigration
             control:

             *    precarious  in-country  cases  not  involving   children:
                  exceptional factors [29];

             *   deportation: very compelling reasons [30];

             *   refusal of leave  to  remain  or  leave  to  enter  cases:
                  compelling circumstances [33], [40].

         (v)       The  state  has  a  wider  margin  of   appreciation   in
             determining the conditions  to  be  satisfied  before  LTE  is
             granted,  by  contrast  with  the  position  in  relation   to
             decisions regarding LTR for persons  with  a  (non-precarious)
             family life already established in the  United  Kingdom.   The
             Secretary of State has already, in effect, made  some  use  of
             this wider margin of appreciation by excluding section EX.1 as
             a basis for grant of LTE, although it is available as a  basis
             for grant of LTR.  [40].

         (vi)     'The LTE Rules therefore maintain,  in  general  terms,  a
             reasonable relationship with the requirements of Article 8  in
             the ordinary run of cases' [40].

         (vii)    'However, it remains possible to imagine cases  where  the
             individual interests at stake are of a  particularly  pressing
             nature so that a good claim for LTE can be established outside
             the Rules. In our view, the  appropriate  general  formulation
             for this category is that  such  cases  will  arise  where  an
             applicant for LTE can show that compelling circumstances exist
             (which are not sufficiently recognised under the new Rules) to
             require the grant of such leave' [40].

         (viii)   The approach to Article 8 in the light  of  the  Rules  in
             Appendix FM-SE should  be  the  same  as  in  respect  of  the
             substantive LTE and LTR Rules in Appendix FM.  In other words,
             the   same   general   position   applies,   that   compelling
             circumstances would have to apply to justify a grant of LTE or
             LTR where the evidence Rules are not complied with [51].

18    Having carefully considered the FTTJ's decision, we are  of  the  view
    that there was no misdirection in law as  to  how  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise was to be performed.  His  directions  in  law  were
    that:

         (i)      the public interest imperative of maintaining  immigration
             control was a 'weighty' matter [20],

         (ii)     the Appellant's non-compliance with the immigration  rules
             was a significant, but not determinative  consideration  [21];
             and

         (iii)    it was necessary, outside of the rules, to show compelling
             circumstances [21] (by reference to Heritage).

    These directions are, we find, consistent with the  guidance  given  by
    the Court of Appeal in  SS  (Congo)  a  short  time  after  the  FTTJ's
    decision was promulgated, as per the passages of the Court of  Appeal's
    judgment that we refer to in paragraph 16 above. The suggestion  within
    the Respondent's Rule 24 notice  that  the  Appellant  needed  to  show
    exceptional features within her case  is  not  a  submission  which  is
    correct in law, but the Judge did not impose such a  threshold  in  any
    event.

19    The Appellant's reference in submissions to Part 5A of NIAA 2002  does
    not materially assist her. The FTTJ referred to ss.117A-D NIAA 2002  at
    [19]. Although he did not further  particularise  the  terms  of  those
    provisions, we find that if  he  had  done  so,  this  would  not  have
    assisted the Appellant.

20    Section s.117B(1) serves only to emphasise  the  point  taken  by  the
    FTTJ in his decision, that the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
    control is in the public interest. As this is a entry clearance appeal,
    and the Appellant is outside the UK, then  the  remaining  sub-sections
    which are relevant  are  s.117B(2)  (ability  to  speak  English)   and
    117B(3) (being financially independent.) However, even if the Appellant
    speaks English, and is financially  independent  (which  is  in  doubt,
    given  that  the  Appellant  was  unable  to  satisfy   the   financial
    eligibility requirements of Appendix FM), then it is relevant  to  note
    that AM (S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) provides at [18] that:

         "The Respondent would only be prevented from (relying upon  fluency
         or financial  independence  as  public  interest  factors  weighing
         against the claimant) if a claimant could demonstrate  fluency,  or
         financial independence, to the level of the requirements set out in
         the Immigration Rules.

    and gave guidance at headnote 2 that:

         "2.      An appellant can obtain no positive right to  a  grant  of
         leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever  the  degree
         of his fluency  in  English,  or  the  strength  of  his  financial
         resources."

21    The Appellant would therefore have gained no positive benefit  if  the
    FTTJ had considered Part 5A in more detail; indeed, he would have  been
    likely to find that the Appellant's non-satisfaction of  the  financial
    eligibility  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  to  have  been  a   factor
    militating against her under s.117B(3).

22    There was no failure to properly consider  the  Sponsor's  ill-health.
    The FTTJ acknowledged that that represented a  difficult  circumstances
    for the Sponsor and that the current situation cannot be easy for  him.
    However, it is to  be  noted  that  the  Sponsor's  kidney  failure  is
    something he has been experiencing since  at  least  August  2013,  and
    there is no challenge from the Appellant against the FTTJ's description
    that the Sponsor's condition is currently properly managed [22].

23    Further, it seems to us that there was in fact little evidence  before
    the First tier of any adverse effect on either the Appellant or Sponsor
    of the refusal of entry clearance, or if the appeal were  unsuccessful,
    other than a bare  assertion  in  a  letter  of  representations  dated
    15.5.14 accompanying the application, asserting that it  would  not  be
    reasonable for the Sponsor to leave the United  Kingdom  to  enjoy  his
    family life, and the Sponsor's suggestion in oral evidence [8] that the
    Appellant would be 'upset' if the appeal failed. The FTTJ expressed the
    view that the present refusal of entry clearance does not mean that the
    Appellant and Sponsor must forever live apart; the Appellant may make a
    renewed application,  ensuring  that  she  full  y  complies  with  the
    requirements of the rules.

24    Finally, in relation to the  submission  of  the  Appellant  that  the
    rules do not accommodate any disability experienced by  a  sponsor;  we
    find that this submission overlooks the exemptions from satisfying  the
    income  requirements,  provided  within  E-ECP.3.3   (receipt   by   an
    applicant's partner of various disability benefits).  The  Sponsor  was
    not in receipt of any such benefit at the date of decision or  the  FTT
    hearing. If that changes in future, the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  could
    consider making a further application, if they wish.

    Decision

25    The decision of the First tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
    any material error of law.

26    We do not set aside the First-tier decision.

27    We dismiss the Appellant's appeal against the First-tier decision.
