                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is citizen India born on 1st October 1986 and he  applied
    on 28th January 2014 for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student.
     That application was refused on 9th April 2014  further  to  Paragraph
    245ZX(d) of the Immigration Rules with reference  to  Paragraph  14  of
    Appendix C.  In essence the appellant had not shown the required  funds
    of �7,200 for a consecutive 28 day period  prior  to  his  application.
    He appealed against the decision of  the  respondent  maintaining  that
    those funds were indeed shown by means of two bank statements which had
    been sent to the Secretary of State with the  application.   That  from
    his father which showed �6, 386.17 and a  further  TSB  bank  statement
    showing that at all times he held in excess of �1,250.  The  respondent
    only acknowledged the statement from the father.

 2. His appeal was heard by First Tier Tribunal Judge Hussain who dismissed
    his appeal on the basis that he could not  locate  the  bank  statement
    from the TSB.     Permission  to  appeal  was  granted  by  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Landes who located the TSB bank statement  on  the  file
    running from 19th July 2013 to 24th January 2014 and  which  pre  dated
    the application by four days.

 3. I find that there was an error of law as the judge failed to take  into
    account the TSB statement which was  on  file.   This  had  a  material
    affect on the assessment of the funds available to the appellant.

 4. The one ground in issue was whether the appellant had shown that he had
    shown the required  funds.   The  question  was  what  was  before  the
    Secretary of State when  she  made  her  decision?  At  the  hearing  I
    requested that Ms Isherwood make enquiries as to  the  documents  which
    had been before the Secretary of State when she made  the  decision  in
    April 2014.  She very efficiently and helpfully made  enquiries.   This
    avoided an adjournment to another day  and  saved  time  for  both  the
    respondent and the appellant.

 5. Documents were faxed, on the morning of the hearing before me, from the
    Home Office in the form of  the  father's  bank  statement,  which  the
    respondent acknowledged in the  refusal  letter  showed  �6,386.17  but
    also, and crucially, the disputed TSB statement showing it  was  before
    the Secretary of State at the date of the  application.   Ms  Isherwood
    accepted, as  the  appellant  had  claimed  all  along,  that  the  TSB
    statement showing at least a further �1,250 at the appellant's disposal
    for the relevant 28 day period, had been sent to the Secretary of State
    with the  application  but  had  not  been  considered.  The  appellant
    produced the original statements which he stated had been  returned  to
    him with the refusal letter.

 6. Ms Isherwood conceded that the appeal should  be  allowed  as  all  the
    relevant requirements had been met.  I agree.

Order

Appeal allowed.
