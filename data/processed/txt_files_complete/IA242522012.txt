Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is the resumed hearing of an  appeal  by  Mr  Haleemudeen  in  the
    circumstances we will describe  shortly,  following  remission  of  his
    appeal by the Court of Appeal.

 2. Mr Haleemudeen is a national of Sri Lanka born on  27  September  1972.
    His appeal has a chequered history.  The underlying  decision  that  is
    the subject of challenge  is a decision of the Secretary of State dated
    16 October 2012.  By that decision Mr Haleemudeen's  application  dated
    28 February 2012 to vary his leave to indefinite leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom on the basis of ten years' continuous  lawful  residence
    under paragraph 276B of the Immigration Rules  HC  395  (as  they  then
    stood) was refused, and  at  the  same  time  the  Secretary  of  State
    determined that removal from the UK would  not  breach  his  Article  8
    rights.

 3. We note, and it is accepted, that the removal decision that accompanied
    the refusal to vary  was  impermissible  and  not  in  accordance  with
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006  (before
    its amendment) as held by the Upper Tribunal  in  Adamally  and  Jaferi
    (section 47 removal decisions: Tribunal Procedures) [2012]  UKUT  00414
    (IAC) (subsequently approved by the Court of Appeal).  Section  47  was
    amended with effect from 8 May 2013 by section 51 Crime and Courts  Act
    2013 so that removal decisions taken simultaneously  with  refusals  to
    vary are now lawful; but that could not have affected the lawfulness of
    the removal  decision  here.   Nevertheless  the  unlawfulness  of  the
    removal decision does  not  affect  the  potential  lawfulness  of  the
    refusal to vary and accordingly the refusal to vary  dated  16  October
    2012 was lawful, subject to any successful challenge on  appeal  by  Mr
    Haleemudeen.

 4. Mr Haleemudeen appealed the refusal to vary his leave and by a decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal ("FTT") promulgated on 3 January 2013, Judge
    Brown allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds but dismissed the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  That  decision  was  appealed  and  by  a
    decision promulgated on 7 March 2013, Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Bruce
    concluded that the FTT decision was in error of law because the reasons
    given were not sufficient.  The decision was set aside and she directed
    that it be remade following a further  oral  hearing.   By  a  decision
    promulgated in June  2013  the  Upper  Tribunal  remade  the  decision,
    finding that removing Mr Haleemudeen would not be  disproportionate  or
    unlawful and therefore dismissed his appeal against  the  Secretary  of
    State's decision.

 5. Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal was given by Upper Tribunal
    Judge Hugo Storey in July 2013, and the appeal was  heard  in  February
    2014.  The Court of Appeal concluded that the FTT Judge  erred  in  his
    approach to Article 8 because he did not consider the appellant's  case
    for remaining in the UK on the basis of his private and family life  in
    the context of the Secretary of State's policy as contained in the  new
    Immigration Rules introduced on 9 July  2012.   Further,  although  the
    Court of Appeal  held  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  entitled  as  a
    consequence to set aside the FTT's decision as flawed  for  failure  to
    take account of relevant considerations, namely the new rules  and  the
    policy contained in them. The Court held that the Upper Tribunal  Judge
    thereafter fell  into  error,  in  particular  in  her  calculation  of
    continuous lawful residence for the purposes of  the  ten  year  lawful
    residence rule in  paragraph  276B  and  that  this  had  vitiated  her
    assessment of the Article 8 question.  There was also a suggestion that
    she inadequately recognised the expectation Mr Haleemudeen  would  have
    as a consequence of his status in  the  UK  under  the  Highly  Skilled
    Migrant Programme and the Tier 1 (General) Migrant provisions.

 6. Consequently, having concluded that the errors were material and having
    considered  and  decided  that  it  was  not  inevitable  that   on   a
    reconsideration the Secretary of State's decision would be found to  be
    a proportionate interference with the appellant's rights by order dated
    2 May 2014, the Court of Appeal allowed the  appeal  and  remitted  the
    Article 8 issue to be redetermined by the Upper Tribunal.

 7. Thus the appeal came before us to determine the Article  8  issue.   Mr
    Haleemudeen was represented by Mr Richardson and the Secretary of State
    was  represented  by  Mr  Saunders.   Both  have  made  focused   clear
    submissions that have assisted us greatly.

 8. Mr Richardson did not call Mr Haleemudeen to give further  evidence  to
    us because the parties are agreed that the facts having now been  found
    by a number of Tribunals are undisputed and are  largely  reflected  in
    the decision of the Court of Appeal.

 9. We deal with the facts in short summary as follows.  Mr Haleemudeen  is
    now aged 41.  He arrived in the UK initially on 22 September 2001  with
    valid leave to enter as a student and has been in this country lawfully
    ever since.  On 26 March 2007, shortly before his  final  student  visa
    was due to expire, he applied to vary his leave to remain as  a  highly
    skilled migrant.  That  application  was  refused  on  19  April  2007.
    Although as a result Mr Haleemudeen's presence in the  UK  was  without
    leave after 31 March 2007, it remained lawful  because  he  had  an  in
    country right of appeal against that decision.  Section  3C  (2)(b)  of
    the Immigration Act 1971 provides that a  person's  leave  is  extended
    during the period  in  which  he  can  appeal  against  an  immigration
    decision, and applied in his case.

10. On 28 April 2007 before the  expiry  of  that  period,  Mr  Haleemudeen
    returned to Sri Lanka in order to re-apply for a highly skilled migrant
    visa from Colombo.  That application was successful and on  22  October
    2007 he returned to this country with a  highly  skilled  migrant  visa
    valid until 28 July 2009.  He was accompanied by his wife, whom he  had
    married in 2005, and their then 21 month old daughter.  A second  child
    was born in the UK on 10 May 2008 and Mr Haleemudeen  was  subsequently
    granted leave under the Tier 1 (General) Migrant scheme (that  replaced
    the Highly Skilled Migrant Visa Programme) from 28 July 2009  until  28
    July 2012.

11. As a person admitted under those  programmes,  Mr  Haleemudeen  had  an
    expectation that provided he complied with the Immigration  Rules  this
    was  a  route  to  obtaining  permanent  settlement  in  this  country.
    Consistently with that understanding he brought his family to  the  UK,
    no doubt on the footing that provided he complied with  the  Rules  and
    was a good citizen he would be working  towards  settled  status.   The
    private life that he established with his family as  a  consequence  of
    that permission was not based on any precarious or temporary status  in
    the United Kingdom but was based  on  the  understanding  that  he  was
    working towards a settled status here.

12. On 20 September 2010, however, at  Barkingside  Magistrates'  Court  Mr
    Haleemudeen pleaded guilty to driving without insurance and  without  a
    licence and was fined ï¿½245.  He stated that the offences were committed
    because his international driver's licence had lost its validity in the
    United Kingdom after a year and  he  only  had  a  provisional  driving
    licence at that stage.  That explanation was not entirely  accepted  by
    the FTT because by the time the offences were committed Mr  Haleemudeen
    had  been  living  and  working  in  the  UK  for  quite   some   time.
    Nevertheless it is right to recognise that the offences are not at  the
    highest end of the offending scale and we accept that these are  strict
    liability offences committed by him without any intention of doing  so,
    as Judge Bruce found.

13. The significance of the convictions is that one of the requirements for
    indefinite leave on the ground of continuous lawful residence that  was
    in force at the time  of  Mr  Haleemudeen's  application  was  that  an
    applicant does not have  any  unspent  convictions.   Mr  Haleemudeen's
    convictions were not spent either on the date of  his  application  for
    indefinite leave or on the date of the Secretary of  State's  decision.
    The convictions will not in fact become spent under the  Rehabilitation
    of Offenders Act 1974 until 19 September 2015.

14. The current position is that Mr Haleemudeen is the assistant manager of
    a Tesco Express shop in Whitechapel.  His wife is a  part-time  student
    and hopes to become a nursery school teacher.   The  couple  made  many
    good friends in this country and Mr Haleemudeen undertakes charity work
    for the Sri Lankan Muslim community in East London which has  been  the
    family's home.  The oldest daughter, who is now aged 8ï¿½, has been  here
    since she was 21 months old, and the youngest daughter is now  aged  6.
    Both girls are settled in school and have established friends  and,  as
    Mr Richardson described it, are beginning a process of extending  their
    horizons beyond the family unit itself.  They are doing well at school,
    enjoying the normal lives of children their age.  The  oldest  daughter
    is being treated for asthma but that is not inhibiting her  ability  to
    enjoy school and the life that she has with her family here.

15. Mr Haleemudeen's application for a variation  to  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the UK was made on 28 February  2012  on  the  basis  of  his
    continuous lawful residence in the UK for  ten  years.   There  were  a
    number of gaps in that residence but these were explained and  accepted
    by the Secretary of State as not causing  a  break  in  his  continuous
    residence.

16. The basis of the Secretary of State's refusal under the Rules  was  set
    out in the decision letter as follows:

         "Under paragraph 276B(iii) one of the requirements to be met by  an
         applicant for leave to remain on the grounds of long residence  ...
         is that the applicant does not have one or more unspent convictions
         within the meaning of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.

         On 20 September 2010 at Barkingside  Magistrates'  Court  you  were
         convicted with the offence of driving without insurance and driving
         otherwise than in accordance with a licence, for which you received
         a fine of ï¿½245.  This conviction will not become  spent  under  the
         terms  of  the  Rehabilitation  of  Offenders  Act  1974  until  19
         September 2015.

         For the reason outlined above your  application  has  been  refused
         under paragraph 276D with reference to paragraph  276B(iii)  of  HC
         395, (as amended)."

17. Accordingly it is to be inferred that had Mr Haleemudeen not  had  that
    conviction or had the Rules  otherwise  provided  in  respect  of  that
    conviction, Mr Haleemudeen's application would have been accepted under
    the Immigration Rules as qualifying him for indefinite leave to  remain
    as a consequence of his ten years' lawful residence here.

The Proper Approach to this Case

18. The first question to be addressed is whether the new Immigration Rules
    in force from 9 July 2012 apply to this appeal.  Mr  Richardson  relies
    upon Edgehill and Another [2014] EWCA Civ 402 for the  submission  that
    the post-July 2012 Immigration Rules governing the  way  in  which  the
    Article 8 evaluation exercise is to be conducted  do  not  apply.   The
    appellant's application was made on 28 February 2012, before the  entry
    into force of the new Rules  on  9  July  2012,  and  the  transitional
    provisions do not cause those Rules to have effect here.  We  are  told
    by him that Edgehill was not cited to the  Court  of  Appeal  (on  this
    appeal) and is therefore not discussed.  It is unfortunate that that is
    the case given the basis on which this appeal was allowed originally by
    the Upper Tribunal and subsequently by the Court of Appeal.

19. Nevertheless, Mr Saunders on behalf  of  the  Secretary  of  State  has
    conceded that Mr Richardson is correct and has not sought to argue  the
    contrary.  He takes no point on the basis on which the Court of  Appeal
    remitted this matter and concedes that the approach adopted in Edgehill
    does apply.

20. Having considered the Court of Appeal's decision in both  Edgehill  and
    in this case, it is clear that there was no discussion at  all  in  the
    Court  of  Appeal's  judgment  in  this  case  of  the  effect  of  the
    transitional provisions on the obligation  to  consider  Article  8  in
    accordance with the new Rules.  At that stage, the Secretary of State's
    position (as argued in Edgehill) was that the Article  8  consideration
    under the new Rules is actually a consideration outside the  Rules  and
    therefore  the  new  Rules  apply  to  any  Article   8   consideration
    irrespective of the transitional provisions.  Mr  Richardson  has  very
    frankly explained that the view  was  taken  on  this  appeal,  perhaps
    unwisely, that this argument  was  correct.  Notwithstanding  that,  in
    Edgehill the Court of Appeal dealt  with  the  transitional  provisions
    head on and given Mr Saunders' concession, we consider  it  appropriate
    to adopt the Edgehill approach here.

21. Accordingly the comments of the Court of Appeal  about  the  formidable
    hurdle that stands in the way of Mr Haleemudeen  succeeding  on  appeal
    are thrown into some  doubt.   In  particular,  at  paragraph  64  Lord
    Justice Beatson said this:

         "I have not found it easy to assess whether it is  inevitable  that
         on reconsideration the Secretary of State's decision will be  found
         to be a proportionate interference with Mr  Haleenmudeen's  rights.
         The provisions of paragraph  276ADE  and  Appendix  FM  undoubtedly
         constitute  a  formidable  hurdle  for  him   to   overcome.    The
         significant shortfall from the twenty  year  residence  requirement
         and the fact that Mr  Haleemudeen's wife and children do  not  meet
         the requirements of paragraphs R-LTRP and E-LTRPT and the  family's
         remaining links in Sri Lanka, including owning  a  property  there,
         provide significant support for Mr Hall's submission."

22.  Undoubtedly  there  would  have  been  a  formidable  hurdle  for   Mr
    Haleemudeen to overcome had the new Rules  applied;  but  in  light  of
    Edgehill we must  consider  his  case  without  deferring  to  the  new
    Immigration Rules' codification of the Article 8  considerations.   The
    approach we therefore adopt is in accordance with the approach set  out
    in Huang at paragraphs 16 and 17,:
           "16.   The authority will wish to consider and  weigh  all  that
             tells in favour of the refusal of leave which  is  challenged,
             with particular reference to justification under article 8(2).
               There  will,  in  almost  any  case,  be   certain   general
             considerations to bear in  mind:  the  general  administrative
             desirability  of  applying  known  rules  if   a   system   of
             immigration control is to be workable, predictable, consistent
             and fair as between one applicant and another; the  damage  to
             good administration and  effective  control  if  a  system  is
             perceived by applicants internationally to be  unduly  porous,
             unpredictable or perfunctory;  the  need  to  discourage  non-
             nationals admitted to the country temporarily  from  believing
             that they can commit serious crimes  and  yet  be  allowed  to
             remain; the need to discourage fraud, deception and deliberate
             breaches of the law; and so  on.   In  some  cases  much  more
             particular reasons will be relied on to justify refusal, as in
             Samaroo v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2001]
             EWCA Civ 1139, [2002] INLR 55 where attention was paid to  the
             Secretary of State's judgment that deportation was a  valuable
             deterrent to actual or  prospective  drug  traffickers,  or  R
             (Farrakhan) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
             [2002] EWCA Civ 606, [2002] QB 1391, an article  10  case,  in
             which note was taken of the Home Secretary's judgment that the
             applicant  posed  a  threat  to  community  relations  between
             Muslims and Jews and a potential threat to  public  order  for
             that reason.  The giving of weight to factors such as these is
             not, in our opinion,  aptly  described  as  deference:  it  is
             performance of the ordinary judicial task of weighing  up  the
             competing  considerations   on   each   side   and   according
             appropriate  weight  to  the  judgment  of   a   person   with
             responsibility for  a  given  subject  matter  and  access  to
             special sources of knowledge and  advice.   That  is  how  any
             rational judicial decision-maker is likely to proceed.  It  is
             to be noted that both Samaroo and Farrakhan  (cases  on  which
             the Secretary of State seeks to  place  especial  reliance  as
             examples of the court attaching very  considerable  weight  to
             decisions of his taken in an  immigration  context)  were  not
             merely challenges  by  way  of  judicial  review  rather  than
             appeals but cases where Parliament had  specifically  excluded
             any right of appeal.
           17.    Counsel for the Secretary of State nevertheless  put  his
             case much higher even than that.  She relied by analogy on the
             decision of the House in Kay v Lambeth London Borough  Council
             [2006] UKHL 10, [2006] 2 AC 465, where  the  House  considered
             the article 8 right to respect for the home.  It held that the
             right of a public authority landlord to enforce  a  claim  for
             possession under domestic law against an occupier whose  right
             to occupy (if any) had  ended  and  who  was  entitled  to  no
             protection in domestic law would in most  cases  automatically
             supply the justification required by  article  8(2),  and  the
             courts would  assume  that  domestic  law  struck  the  proper
             balance, at any rate unless the contrary were shown.  So here,
             it was said, the appellate immigration authority should assume
             that the Immigration  Rules  and  supplementary  instructions,
             made by the responsible minister and laid  before  Parliament,
             had the imprimatur of democratic approval and should be  taken
             to strike the right  balance  between  the  interests  of  the
             individual  and  those  of  the  community.   The  analogy  is
             unpersuasive.  Domestic housing policy has been  a  continuing
             subject of discussion and debate in Parliament over very  many
             years, with the competing interests of landlords  and  tenants
             fully represented, as also the  public  interest  in  securing
             accommodation for  the  indigent,  averting  homelessness  and
             making the best use of finite public resources.  The  outcome,
             changed from time to time, may truly be said  to  represent  a
             considered democratic compromise.  This cannot be said in  the
             same  way  of  the   Immigration   Rules   and   supplementary
             instructions, which are not the product of  active  debate  in
             Parliament, where non-nationals  seeking  leave  to  enter  or
             remain,  are  not  in  any  event  represented.   It  must  be
             remembered that if an applicant qualifies  for  the  grant  of
             leave to enter or remain under the Rules and is refused leave,
             the immigration appeal authority must allow  such  applicant's
             appeal by virtue of paragraph 21(1)(a) of Part III of Schedule
             4 to the 1999 Act.  It is a premise of  the  statutory  scheme
             enacted by Parliament that an applicant may  fail  to  qualify
             under the Rules and yet may have a valid claim  by  virtue  of
             article 8."
Our Evaluation

23. Against that background we turn to consider  the  difficult  evaluative
    proportionality assessment.  As indicated,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal of this  appellant's  claim  based  on  ten  years'  continuous
    residence under the Rules as they then stood  was  based  on  paragraph
    276B (iii) and his  unspent  convictions.   Absent  those,  his  lawful
    presence in the UK met the requirements for a grant of indefinite leave
    to remain on the date of  his  application  and  on  the  date  of  the
    decision and original appeal.

24. In the circumstances, Mr Richardson relies as a matter of  significance
    on the fact that the Rules changed on 13 December 2012  and  no  longer
    identify as a barrier to the grant of indefinite leave  to  remain  the
    fact of an unspent  conviction.   That  change  in  the  Rules  remains
    unaltered today.  Indeed Mr Saunders accepted that the appellant  would
    be likely to succeed under Rule 276B of  the  Immigration  Rules  today
    based on ten years' continuous residence.  We agree with Mr  Richardson
    that  this  is  significant  in  any  assessment  of  the   Article   8
    proportionality issue, as is the fact that  the  Rules  provide  for  a
    grant of indefinite leave to remain to someone who  has  been  lawfully
    resident for ten years.  Mr Saunders  argued that the fact of  thirteen
    years' residence now clocked up by Mr Haleemudeen should be  considered
    on its own without reference to either ten years' lawful  residence  or
    fourteen  years'  continuous  residence  but  we  cannot  accept  that.
    However, at paragraph 55 the Court of Appeal said in this case:

         "The position taken by Mr Hall does  not  fit  with  his  principal
         argument when dealing with whether the FTT had erred.  It is to  be
         recalled that, in  that  context,  he  submitted  that  a  tribunal
         considering Article  8  must  give  primary  consideration  to  the
         Secretary of State's policy as it is contained in the new Rules and
         to the status of the Rules as a  code.   The  submission  that  the
         provisions in  the  Rules  on  the  meaning  of  continuous  lawful
         residence should not be taken into consideration once it  has  been
         concluded that the Rules do not apply appears to have an element of
         unjustified cherry-picking.   This  is  because  the  provision  on
         continuous residence in paragraph 276A applies to paragraph  276ADE
         as well as to paragraph 276B.  The effect of Mr Hall's submissions,
         if accepted, would be that when considering  proportionality  under
         the general law and outside the Rules, those  parts  of  paragraphs
         276ADE and Appendix FM which reflect the more stringent policy must
         be considered but  the  court  should  not  have  regard  to  those
         provisions  which,  like  those  on  continuous  lawful  residence,
         moderate that stringency."

    And then at paragraph 57:

         "I reject the submission  that  provisions  such  as  that  on  the
         meaning of 'continuous lawful residence' in paragraph  276A  should
         be disregarded once a  case  falls  outside  the  Rules.   This  is
         because although they are not dispositive once it is clear that the
         case is not within the Rules they provide guidance about the policy
         of the Secretary of State in the same  way  as  the  provisions  in
         paragraph 276ADE and Appendix FM do."

25. Accordingly, although not dispositive, once it is clear that  the  case
    is not within the Rules, the Rules nevertheless provide guidance  about
    the policy of the Secretary of State in relation  to  her  attitude  to
    convictions that are unspent  and  the  meaning  of  continuous  lawful
    residence. Given the Rules no longer contain a barrier by reference  to
    unspent  convictions  and  that  the   appellant   would   succeed   in
    establishing continuous lawful residence, we accept that is a  powerful
    indicator in relation to  the  proportionality  assessment  and  weighs
    strongly in favour of the appellant when considering the  Secretary  of
    State's need to maintain effective immigration control in this case.

26. There is no dispute that the appellant did not meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules at the date of the decision.  That  must  be  our
    starting  point.   In  most   cases   the   Rules   will   strike   the
    proportionality assessment properly and will be the end of  the  matter
    since the authorities make it clear that the focus of any assessment of
    whether interference with private life pursuant to the requirements  of
    immigration control is proportionate should be whether the Secretary of
    State's decision is in accordance  with  those  provisions.   Where  an
    appellant does not meet the requirements of the  Rules  there  must  be
    compelling circumstances that mean  that  refusal  of  the  application
    would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the individual  or
    their family such that refusal would not be proportionate under Article
    8 that leave should be granted under Article 8.

27.  Here,  Mr  Haleemudeen  has  never  breached  Immigration   Rules   or
    Immigration Law.  Although he  committed  a  strict  liability  driving
    offence he did that without any intention of doing so and  the  offence
    was in the scale of things on the less serious side.  We  have  already
    referred to the Secretary of State's change of policy  in  this  regard
    and to the  fact  that  it  would  not  have  been  a  barrier  to  his
    application if made after 13 December 2012.  Mr Haleemudeen has  always
    worked hard.  He has contributed to the community of the UK paying  his
    taxes  and  by  way  of  substantial  student  fees.   The  family  has
    integrated well into the community in East London that has  been  their
    home for many years and he has done good works in that community.

28. We recognise that the family would  move  as  a  unit  were  a  removal
    decision  to  take  effect  and  that  it  could  be  said   in   those
    circumstances that the best interests  of  the  children  are  normally
    served by remaining as a family unit.  These are, as Mr Saunders urged,
    normal happy children who will no doubt transition, albeit following  a
    period of disruption, well to Sri Lanka.

29. We consider as  a  weighty  factor  in  this  case  the  fact  that  Mr
    Haleemudeen's family and private life in this country  has  been  built
    not on any precarious or temporary status  but  on  a  properly  formed
    expectation based on the Immigration Rules and representations made  by
    the Secretary of State  in  her  Highly  Skilled  Migrant  and  General
    Migrant programmes that he was working towards settled status  in  this
    country.

30. We have to balance against those considerations the public interest  at
    stake here and whether  it  is  both  necessary  and  proportionate  to
    require this family to leave the UK.  Given their lawful presence  here
    at all times, the legitimate aims served by any removal can only be the
    need to preserve the predictability and certainty of decision-making in
    an immigration context in the public interest, and the  maintenance  of
    immigration control.  Given the change in the Rules that now means  the
    unspent  conviction  would  not  be  a  barrier  to  a  long  residence
    application and the rationale for that change which must  be  that  the
    new Rules are more reflective of the Secretary of  State's  policy  and
    her interests, the aim is weaker here and is more easily outweighed  by
    the compelling circumstances of an individual case.

31. The Article 8 exercise is always a difficult evaluative exercise but we
    have concluded that the powerful factors in Mr  Haleemudeen's  case  do
    outweigh the policy interests  in  the  removal  of  this  family.   We
    therefore allow his appeal on Article 8 grounds  by  reference  to  the
    features we have just described.
