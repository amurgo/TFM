                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Gordon  promulgated  on  12th  November  2013  in  which  she
        dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the refusal  of  an  Entry
        Clearance Officer (ECO) to grant her  leave  to  enter  the  United
        Kingdom. The Judge records in paragraph 1 of her determination that
        there was a dispute between the parties in relation to  the  nature
        of the application but that the immigration decision  under  appeal
        is  the  refusal  dated  8th  January  2013  which  refers  to   an
        application for entry clearance  as  an  adult  dependent  relative
        under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


     2. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 5 to 11 of the  determination
        the Judge accepted that the appeal was against the  refusal  of  an
        application as an adult family dependent and not a  refugee  family
        reunion application.


     3. Having considered the evidence relating to the relationship between
        the Appellant and her sponsor, and the question of the existence of
        exceptional circumstances, the Judge concluded in paragraph 23 that
        the evidence provided is "inconsistent and unreliable".  The  Judge
        sets out her assessment of that evidence from paragraph 24  of  the
        determination including that fact she accepts that the Appellant is
        23  years  of  age  and  female,  that  a   contemporaneous   birth
        certificate exists but  was  not  adduced,  that  the  sponsor  and
        Appellant could have put their relationship  beyond  doubt  by  DNA
        tests but none  had  been  commissioned  or  undertaken,  that  the
        refusal makes it clear that the relationship  between  the  sponsor
        and the Appellant is challenged, and that the lack of  DNA  results
        when taken together with the other evidence casts  doubt  upon  the
        sponsor's claim to be the Appellant's  blood  mother.  The  Judge's
        findings of fact are  be  found  in  paragraph  27  to  30  of  the
        determination  and  in  relation  to  the  application  under   the
        Immigration Rules can be summarised as follows:


     i.   I have not seen a contemporaneous birth certificate or  any  other
   reliable identification or other documents dating  from  the  appellant's
   early childhood evidencing that the  sponsor  is  the  appellant's  blood
   mother [27].


     ii.  I find the appellant has not discharged the burden of  proof  upon
   her        to show she had lived in Eritrea, that she  ever  returned  to
   Ethiopia,      that she ever lived in a refugee camp and subsequently  in
   Addis      Ababa as claimed. In short I find she has  not  satisfactorily
   evidenced      anything other than that  she  is  an  Ethiopian  national
   [27].


     iii. I find the sponsor is not the appellant's  biological  mother  and
   that       her husband is not  the  appellant's  biological  father.  The
   evidence       suggests there might very well be a relationship  of  some
   sort           between the appellant and sponsor but  the  appellant  has
   not            discharged the burden of proof upon her  to  the  required
   standard to         prove what that relationship is [28].


     iv.  There are no exceptional compassionate circumstances  which  would
   justify granting leave to enter the United Kingdom outside            the
   Immigration Rules.  It was not accepted that the appellant has       ever
   suffered the problems ultimately claimed by the sponsor. There        are
   no  compassionate  circumstances  to   be   considered   in   this   case
   [28].


     v.   The issue of accommodation was not addressed  at  all  during  the
   hearing. Neither the nature of the residence or size of the  property  is
   addressed.  The  appellant  has  not  discharged  the  burden  of   proof
   upon  her  to  show  she  can  be  accommodated   in   the   UK   without
   recourse to public funds [29].


     vi.  Appendix FM EC-DR 1.1(d) and E-ECDR 2.3 are not discharged.


     4. The Article 8 aspect the claim  was  considered  and  dismissed  in
        paragraph 31.


     5. Permission to appeal was initially refused by another judge of  the
        First-tier Tribunal but thereafter granted on a renewed application
        by Upper Tribunal Judge Storey on 18th February 2014.



Error of law


     6. In his grant of permission to appeal Judge Storey stated it may be
        arguable that in finding the appellant and sponsor were not
        daughter and mother the Judge erred in failing to take account of
        the sponsor's statement and that it was also arguable that the
        judge wrongly assessed the evidence relating to the appellant's
        continued efforts to apply for family reunion from 2009 onwards and
        failed to consider whether there was an applicable Home Office
        policy.


     7. Before the Upper Tribunal Miss Rasoul stated that an application
        had been made on the basis of family reunion but the Applicant was
        told that a fee had to be paid. The compassionate and compelling
        circumstances said to exist are that the Appellant forms part of a
        family group and that Judge Gordon erred in failing to consider the
        evidence made available. It was accepted that the issue of the
        nature of the application was not ignored as paragraphs 5 to 11 of
        the determination demonstrates.


     8. It is not disputed that the Appellant made an application for leave
        to enter the United Kingdom for the purposes of family reunion and
        within her evidence is a copy of a letter from her representatives
        to the Visa Application Centre in Addis Ababa, dated 4th February
        2009, asking the Visa Officer to consider an application for entry
        to the United Kingdom for the purposes of family reunion following
        the grant of refugee status to their client. Earlier correspondence
        disclosed and dated 15th January 2009 includes a letter from the
        representatives to the sponsor following a consultation in which
        she asked for assistance in enabling her husband who lives in Italy
        and her daughter living in Sudan to enter the United Kingdom for
        the purposes of family reunion.


     9. Further correspondence from David Gray Solicitors, dated 8th April
        2011 and addressed to a local Member of Parliament, refers to the
        sponsor who is stated to be a refugee from Eritrea who has made an
        application for her daughter to be able to enter the United Kingdom
        under the principles of family reunion.  The letter states that the
        ECO is refusing to accept the reunion application without charging
        a fee of ï¿½1,814 which is the adult dependent relative fee and
        asking the MP to write a letter in support.


    10. At pages 11 to 18 of the Appellant's appeal bundle is a copy of the
        application for United Kingdom Entry Clearance -Settlement - Family
        Reunion - Other Dependent Relative. It is stated this is the
        application that was made. This is the only application form Miss
        Rasoul is aware of.  At  page 188 of the bundle is a printout of
        the Visa Application Fees and Guidance for Ethiopia, and at page 19
        confirmation of an appointment on Monday, 17th December 2012 at the
        Visa Application Office in Addis Ababa, although the refusal does
        not show whether the Appellant attended the appointment or not.


    11. It was accepted by Miss Rasoul that the Rules are relevant but that
        the Appellant cannot satisfy the Rules as she was overage at the
        time although it is stated the ECO should have considered the
        relevant policy to be found at page 187 of the appeal bundle which
        was also before Judge Gordon. That policy is the Family Reunion for
        Asylum Seekers Family, the final paragraph of which on page 187
        states:


              "Under the Immigration Rules, only your pre-existing family
   (husband,           wife, civil partner or unmarried/same-sex partner,
   plus any children                under 18 who formed part of the family
   unit when you fled to seek                asylum) can apply to enter the
   UK under the family reunion programme.             However, we may allow
   family reunion for other family members if there            are
   compassionate reasons why their case should be considered outside
   the Immigration Rules"


    12. The content of the policy indicates a discretionary element which
        it was submitted the decision did not show had been exercised. In
        this regard the Tribunal were referred to HK (Discrimination -
        refugees' family policy) Somalia [2006] UKAIT 00021 and
        specifically paragraphs 9 and 10, although to make sense of
        paragraph 9 it is necessary to consider paragraph 8:



              8.  Mr Mukherjee also referred us to the comments of Collins J
   in Hamfi at                  paragraph 53, where he points out that the
   hurdle in the policy is not                   necessarily as high as that
   in the Immigration Rules, for there is in the                   policy no
   requirement that the "compassionate circumstances" be "most
   exceptional", although they do have to be "compelling". He said that the
              Appellant's position is similar to that recognised by the
   Immigration                      Appeal Tribunal in AH (Somalia) [2004]
   UKIAT 00027 in that there were                circumstances which could
   be regarded as compelling which the                    Respondent had not
   properly examined. He submitted that the appeal                 should be
   allowed in the same way as it was in AH, so that the Respondent
     could look properly at the circumstances in question.

              9.  As we remarked at the hearing, it is very difficult indeed
   to see that those                submissions have any force in this case.
   On the face of the explanatory                statement, this is clearly
   not a case where the Secretary of State did not                 have
   regard to the questions posed by the policy to which reference has
     been made. On the contrary, he specifically investigated the
   circumstances                and reached the conclusion that they were
   not sufficient to merit the grant                  of entry clearance in
   this case. Nothing more could be required.

              10.      (For the avoidance of doubt, we note that the word
   "compelling" as used in                   the policy is a term of art: it
   does not imply that the circumstances so                    described are
   such as to compel the grant of entry clearance. If it did, there
     would obviously be no scope for the exercise of discretion once
              "compelling compassionate circumstances" (whether with or
   without a               comma after the first word) were detected. The
   wording of the policy and                 the procedure under it, and the
   wording of the explanatory statement               makes it clear that
   the word is intended to indicate that the circumstances
   are such as to compel compassion rather than to compel entry clearance.)


    13. It was submitted the ECO failed to understand the nature of the
        application as evidenced by the dispute regarding the payment of a
        fee and, as a result, did not consider the correct policy.


    14. In relation to the adults dependent relative route, it was conceded
        that the Appellant could not satisfied the requirements of the
        Rules and the issue was whether the decision relating to the policy
        was in accordance with the law bearing in mind it was legitimate
        expectation that it would be considered and applied by the ECO.


    15. In relation to Article 8 ECHR, it was stated there was no mention
        of the May 2008 statement although it is accepted there was no DNA
        evidence before the Judge.  It was submitted the Judge failed to
        consider the MPs letter and the history of the application and a
        rational consideration of the evidence will show that the Appellant
        was the daughter of her sponsor in the United Kingdom.


    16. It was put to Miss Rasoul during the course of the hearing that in
        light of the absence of the DNA evidence and the fact the Judge
        considered all the material made available, and applied the correct
        legal standard, that this was in effect a weight challenge dressed
        up as a rationality challenge, which was not accepted.


    17. Miss Rasoul also sought to raise an additional ground-based on an
        error of fact but this had not been formally pleaded and so there
        was no grant of permission to proceed on this basis made by a judge
        of the First-tier Tribunal which is a mandatory requirement within
        the Rules before the Upper Tribunal is able to consider whether
        permission should be granted on a renewed application. Permission
        to proceed on this basis was refused.


    18. The actual terms of the decision under challenge refers to the
        claim that the Appellant is related to the sponsor and her husband
        but that in the claimed father's visa application in 2009, whilst
        providing a similar name for his daughter, he provided a completely
        different date of birth casting doubt over the claimed
        relationship. It was therefore clear to the Appellant as early as
        January 2013 that the relationship between the Appellant and her
        alleged parents was not accepted and was in dispute. This is
        relevant for even if the application was for family reunion, to be
        a qualifying member under those provisions the applicant child of
        the refugee must be under the age of 18, not leading an independent
        life, is not marriage and is not in a civil partnership,  has not
        formed an independent family unit, unless the same child over the
        age of 18 can succeed under the terms of the policy.


    19. It is a fundamental element of this claim that a key issue, whether
        the Appellant is related to her sponsor or not in the manner
        alleged, is true.  The Judge raised the lack of DNA evidence with
        the sponsor in court and records the reply which the Judge found to
        lack credibility.  It is not disputed that the DNA evidence was not
        obtained until after the decision had been made. It is arguably,
        however, not a legal error for a Judge to have made a decision in
        accordance with the available evidence, even if the party against
        whom that decision has been made then obtains evidence dealing with
        the weakness in the case identified by the Judge, such that the
        determination should be set aside on the basis of that material
        which did not exist at the date of the hearing.


    20. A reading of the determination clearly shows the Judge considered
        all the evidence she was asked to consider with the required degree
        of care, that of anxious scrutiny. I do not accept the assertion
        the Judge failed to consider relevant aspects of the evidence has
        been proved. The Judge also heard oral evidence and having had the
        benefit of doing so, and having assessed the arguments
        appropriately, concluded that the claim lacked credibility.  The
        Judge accepted the Appellant was related to the sponsor "in some
        way" on the evidence but not as parent and child as alleged.  The
        Judge considered the existence of compassionate and/or exceptional
        circumstances but found on the basis of the evidence that no such
        circumstances had been proved to exist. The ECO specifically stated
        that consideration had been given to rights under Article 8 ECHR
        although it was said not to have been established that there was
        family life recognised by Article 8 and so there was no breach of
        that article although, in the alternative, if family life had been
        established it was accepted the decision was proportionate. It is
        also clear that the ECO considered whether there were any
        compassionate circumstances warranting consideration outside the
        Immigration Rules but found no satisfactory evidence of any
        compassionate circumstances or particular problems being
        experienced such as health or social issues had been presented.  It
        was not accepted that the Appellant was in need of particular
        supervision or care. This is clearly indicative of an awareness and
        consideration of a discretionary element which was not found to be
        established on the facts.


    21. I find no material legal error material to the decision to dismiss
        the appeal proved. It was accepted that a fresh application could
        be made and if material is now available to support such an
        application it appears on the facts and in law that is the most
        appropriate way for the Appellant to proceed.



Decision

    22. There is no material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    23. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005. I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
