For the Respondent:    Ms M Tanner, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision of  Judge  Brenells
    made following a hearing at Taylor House on 15th February 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on the 10th January 1982.
     He applied to come to the  UK  as  a  spouse  but  was  refused  entry
    clearance on 4th April 2012 under paragraph 281 of HC 395.

 3. The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that each of the  parties
    to the marriage intended to live permanently with the other as  his  or
    her spouse or that the marriage was subsisting as required by paragraph
    281(iii) of the Immigration Rules. Neither was he satisfied that  there
    would be adequate accommodation for  the  parties  and  any  dependants
    without recourse to public funds in accommodation which they  owned  or
    occupied exclusively or that the parties  would  be  able  to  maintain
    themselves and any dependants  without  recourse  to  public  funds  as
    required by paragraph 281(iv) and (v) of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The Judge noted that, on 24th February 2011, the Appellant had appealed
    against an earlier decision refusing him entry clearance, and the judge
    in that case  recorded  that  the  Respondent  had  accepted  that  the
    Appellant was validly married to the Sponsor and that they intended  to
    live together permanently and their marriage was subsisting.   He  said
    that there was no evidence before him which led  him  to  do  otherwise
    than follow the previous judge's  conclusions.  Those  issues  are  now
    settled.

 5. The Sponsor is unwell and has been unable  to  work  for  a  number  of
    years.  She relies on State benefits and  financial  support  from  her
    brother, Mr M H Miah.  The evidence  before  the  judge  was  that  she
    receives �20.30 child benefit per week, �54.82  child  tax  credit  per
    week and �95.10 income support every two weeks making her total  weekly
    earnings around �122.67.

 6. Her rent of �84.04 was paid by the local  council  by  way  of  housing
    benefit  and  she  does  not  pay  council  tax.   There  was  in  fact
    conflicting evidence as to whether she makes any  contribution  to  her
    rental costs.  Amongst the papers is a Benefit Decision  Notice,  dated
    28 September 2009, which states that she should pay �27.58  weekly  but
    that includes the recovery of an amount of overpayments.   The  tenancy
    agreement refers to a total amount payable of �84.04  and  it  was  the
    Sponsor's evidence that she makes  no  contribution.  It  may  well  be
    therefore that the overpayments are  cleared.  In  fact  the  point  is
    immaterial.

 7. It is agreed between all parties that there is a  shortfall  of  �63.01
    per week in the Sponsor's income, being the difference between what she
    receives and is entitled to on her own account, namely �122.76, and the
    amount which would be payable by way of income support to a couple  and
    one child which, at the date of decision, was �185.68.

 8. The Sponsor has some savings. She has received gifts of money over some
    years from her brother who is single and lives with his parents with no
    dependants.  He has worked as a delivery driver with the Royal Mail for
    the last seven years and earns around �500 per week.

 9. Prior to the Appellant's application he  transferred  �5,000  into  the
    Sponsor's account and the evidence before the Entry  Clearance  Officer
    was that she had �7,269 in her savings account and �366 in her  current
    account.  By the date of decision she had over �10,000 in  her  savings
    account. At the date of the hearing before us she had over �12,000.

10. The Judge accepted that the Sponsor's brother had given her  the  money
    in her savings account which would enable her to cover  the  shortfall,
    and that there was no bar to her relying on that  money,  providing  of
    course that it was genuinely available to her, but  he  said  that  the
    evidence did not  establish  that  the  brother  would  be  willing  to
    continue to subsidise his sister and her family "in perpetuity".

11. He wrote as follows:-

         "I have Mr M H Miah's statement and have heard his  oral  evidence.
         I also have copies of his wage  slips  and  P60.   He  has  however
         provided no evidence of his outgoings  and  any  commitments  which
         would have  enabled  me  to  assess  whether  he  could  afford  to
         subsidise his sister and her family in perpetuity and  particularly
         if the Appellant were unable to get a job.

         Having considered all the evidence before me  and  particularly  in
         view of the length of  time  the  subsidy  is  likely  to  have  to
         continue, and because of the  conflicting  evidence  given  by  the
         Sponsor and  her  brother,  I  find  that  the  Appellant  has  not
         established that Mr M H Miah is willing and  able  to  continue  to
         subsidise his sister and her family for the foreseeable future."

The Grounds of Application

12. The Appellant sought permission to appeal, essentially on  the  grounds
    that the Judge had  misdirected  himself  in  requiring  the  Sponsor's
    brother to provide assistance for  "the  foreseeable  future"  and  had
    otherwise erred in his assessment of the evidence in  relation  to  the
    proposed job offer.

13. Permission to appeal was initially refused by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Brunnen but subsequently granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Grubb  who
    said:

         "In order to meet the maintenance requirement the Appellant  relied
         upon third party support from the Sponsor's brother.  At  para  31,
         the judge accepted that the Sponsor had, as a  result,  savings  in
         excess of �7,000 and her brother continued to make weekly  payments
         to her.  At para 35 however he was not satisfied  on  the  evidence
         that the Sponsor's  brother  would  be  willing  to  subsidise  the
         Appellant and Sponsor in perpetuity.  And further at para 37 he was
         not satisfied that the Sponsor's brother would be willing and  able
         to subsidise them for the foreseeable future.  It is arguable  that
         the judge erred in law  as  the  Appellant  would  have  sufficient
         resources available to him and the Sponsor to  maintain  themselves
         during the initial period of his visa; a finding the judge may well
         have made  at  para  31.   Arguably,  in  those  circumstances  the
         Appellant met the requirements of para  281(v)  (Begum  and  Others
         (maintenance - savings)  Bangladesh  [2011]  UKUT  00246  (IAC)  at
         [25]."

The Hearing

14. Although initially of the opposite view, Ms Tanner  accepted  that  the
    Judge did err in law for the reasons stated in the grounds and  in  the
    grant of permission, and agreed that the Sponsor had demonstrated  that
    she had adequate savings to meet the shortfall in her income during the
    initial two year visa.

Findings and Conclusions

15. In Begum the Upper Tribunal stated as follows:

         "On the face of it the Appellant fulfilled the requirements of  the
         Immigration Rules  in  that  they  have  a  sufficient  income  and
         sufficient savings to make up any shortfall for the period  of  the
         initial  visa.   They  are  on  notice  that  when  they  make   an
         application for indefinite leave to remain they will have  to  meet
         the  maintenance  requirements  of  the  Rules.   The  longer  term
         position is not irrelevant, as Mrs Brooks Bank submitted but it  is
         an unknown quantity.  They may or may not be in a position to do so
         depending on a number of different factors...

         If the Appellants are able to meet the requirements of adequacy for
         the period of the initial visa and there is no reason at this stage
         to believe that they will not  be  able  to  meet  the  maintenance
         requirements in the longer term, then they are  entitled  to  entry
         clearance."

16. The Judge therefore erred in law in asking himself the wrong  question,
    namely whether the third party support would be  available  either  for
    the foreseeable future or in perpetuity.  Instead he should have  asked
    himself whether the Sponsor had sufficient savings available to her  to
    cover the period of the initial visa, namely two years.  If  she  could
    meet the shortfall in her income for that time, so  as  to  fulfil  the
    requirements of adequacy within the Immigration Rules, the appeal ought
    to have been allowed.

17. Mr Bhuiyan asked us to consider whether the reported decision in  Begum
    was in error when it added the  caveat

         "and there is no reason at this stage to believe that they will not
         be able to meet the maintenance requirements in the longer term"

18. We find no reason to revisit that  decision  in  the  context  of  this
    appeal because Ms Tanner did not argue that the Appellant  should  fail
    on that ground. In any event, as was said in Begum it is  not  possible
    to say what a family's situation will be in two years.  The  Judge  was
    not impressed with the job offer put forward by the Appellant,  and  it
    remains to be seen whether he finds work. It is  possible  to  envisage
    cases in which there is clear evidence that the parties would never  be
    able to support themselves. The Immigration Rules have  looked  to  the
    parties being self sufficient in the longer term in the  past,  and  of
    course they have changed since this decision was made, but  since  this
    is not at issue here we propose to say no more about it.

Decision

19. The original judge erred in law and his decision is set aside.   It  is
    remade as follows.  The Appellant's appeal is allowed.
