Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Pipi
For the Respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Haiti born on 19th March 1984.

 2. On 29th July 2014 the Appellant  applied  for  variation  of  leave  to
    remain on the  basis  of  her  marriage  to  a  British  citizen.   The
    application was refused by the Respondent on 9th  September  2014.   An
    appeal against that refusal was allowed  on  human  rights  grounds  by
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal V A Cox on 30th December 2014.

 3. The Respondent's representative applied for permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal and permission was granted by Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Kelly on 12th February 2015.  Permission was  granted  on  the
    basis that it was arguable that the First-tier Tribunal's finding  that
    the Appellant's removal would be "simply  in  order  to  secure  formal
    compliance with the entry clearance Rules" was  inconsistent  with  its
    earlier  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  not  met  the  substantive
    requirements of Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  former
    finding appears to have been the mainstay of the Tribunal's decision to
    allow the appeal notwithstanding its later and  arguably  contradictory
    assertion that it had "not placed emphasis on any prospects of  success
    on return".

 4. Thus the matter came before me in the Upper Tribunal for  an  error  of
    law  hearing  on  9th  April  2015.    The   Appellant   was   present.
    Representation was as mentioned above.

 5. The Appellant has a good immigration history.  She first arrived in the
    UK in 2010 with a valid student visa.  While in  the  country  in  that
    capacity the Appellant met and formed a relationship  with  Mr  Matthew
    John Bull,  a  British  citizen,  whom  she  has  since  married.   The
    Appellant returned to Haiti in 2011 but her relationship with  Mr  Bull
    developed and in 2014 the Appellant was granted a visa as a fiancï¿½e and
    she returned to the UK.  In June 2014 she and Mr Bull were married.  It
    is not disputed that their marriage is genuine  and  subsisting.   Both
    the Appellant and her husband were found to be credible by  the  First-
    tier Judge and that finding is not the subject of challenge.  The First-
    tier Judge records in her decision that  at  the  date  of  the  appeal
    hearing the Appellant was approximately five weeks' pregnant.  She  had
    only discovered her pregnancy the week before the appeal hearing.  Now,
    the appellant is six months' pregnant and her baby is therefore due  to
    be born in three months time.

 6. Mr McVeety's submission before me was short and  succinct.   He  relied
    upon  the  reasons  submitted  by  his  colleague  in  support  of  the
    application for permission to appeal.  He argued  that  the  First-tier
    Judge had plainly misapplied the Chikwamba principles in  allowing  the
    appeal on human rights grounds.  The judge had clearly found earlier in
    her decision and reasons that the appellant  had  failed  to  meet  the
    maintenance requirements of the Immigration Rules, therefore it  was  a
    material error to allow the appeal on the basis that requiring  her  to
    return to her home country to apply for entry clearance would be a mere
    formality.

 7. The Appellant's representative, Mr Pipi, submitted a skeleton  argument
    in which he sought to argue that the appeal should  have  been  allowed
    under the  Immigration  Rules  and  he  applied  to  adduce  additional
    documents.   There  were  two  letters  confirming  the  fact  of   the
    Appellant's pregnancy and further evidence  in  the  form  of  payslips
    relating to the Appellant's husband.

 8. The representatives had also submitted a Rule  24  response  dated  6th
    April 2015 but Mr McVeety argued that  the  Appellant's  representative
    was attempting to put forward an  argument  which  had  been  expressly
    prohibited by virtue of the Upper Tribunal's decision in EG and NG  (UT
    Rule 17: with Rule; Rule 24: scope) Ethiopia [2013] UKUT  00143  (IAC).
    Paragraph 3 of the head note to the decision in EG and NG states -

         "A party that seeks to persuade the Upper  Tribunal  to  replace  a
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal with a decision that would make
         a material difference to one of the  party's  needs  permission  to
         appeal.   The  Upper  Tribunal  cannot  entertain  an   application
         purporting to be made under Rule 24 for permission to appeal  until
         the First-tier Tribunal has been asked in writing for permission to
         appeal  and  has  either  refused  it  or  declined  to  admit  the
         application."

 9. Mr Pipi accepted that no written application for permission  to  appeal
    had been made and therefore he was obliged to concede  that  the  Upper
    Tribunal could not entertain his  application  purporting  to  be  made
    under Rule 24.

10. It seems abundantly clear that the First-tier Judge unfortunately erred
    in law in her application of the guidance  given  in  Chikwamba.   That
    only applies where it is clear than  an  applicant  would  satisfy  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and the issue is  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect that applicant  to  return  to  his  or  her  home
    country in order to make an application for entry clearance.   In  this
    appeal, the First-tier Judge clearly found that the Appellant  did  not
    satisfy  the  financial  requirements  of  the   relevant   Rules   but
    nevertheless  proceeded  to  allow  the  appeal  under  Article  8   in
    accordance with the Chikwamba principles.

11. The present situation is that the Appellant is  now  approximately  six
    months through her pregnancy and her baby is  therefore  due  in  three
    months time.  The child's father, Mr Matthew Bull, is a British citizen
    and the baby will therefore be entitled  to  British  nationality.   Mr
    McVeety did not seek to argue that it would be reasonable to expect the
    Appellant to return to Haiti, with or without her husband, at this late
    stage in her pregnancy.  Nor would it be  reasonable  to  take  a  very
    young baby who, as a British citizen, is fully entitled to the benefits
    which this country has to offer in terms of healthcare,  to  a  country
    such as Haiti.  Equally, it would be unreasonable  to  separate  mother
    and baby by requiring the Appellant to return  to  Haiti  in  order  to
    apply for entry clearance.

12. Section 55 does not apply to the best interests of an unborn child.   I
    could set aside the decision and  proceed  to  make  a  fresh  decision
    myself  but  since  there  is  no  dispute  regarding  the   background
    circumstances, there seems little point in taking  such  a  course.   I
    have decided that the most appropriate course is to rule that the error
    of law made by the First-tier Tribunal is not material  and  to  direct
    that the determination shall stand.

NOTICE OF DECISION

The making of the decision by the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law but the error is not material and therefore  I
do not set aside the decision.

No anonymity direction is made.
