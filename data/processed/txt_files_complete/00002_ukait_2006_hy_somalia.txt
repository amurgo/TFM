Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr P Jorro, of Counsel, instructed by
     IAS (Tribunal Unit)
For the Respondent:    Mrs M Tanner, Home Office Presenting Officer


The finding of the IAT in YS  and   HA  that  a  Midgan  who  had  lost  the
protection of a local patron or patrons, and who had not  found  alternative
protection in the city would be vulnerable to persecution is  good  law  and
applies to Yibir as well.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appealed to an Immigration Judge against the decision  of
      the Secretary of State of April 22nd, 2005 to remove him as an illegal
      entrant.    Reconsideration of  that  decision  was  sought,  and  was
      granted on 7 July 2005.   The  hearing  of  the  reconsideration  took
      place before us on 11  November  2005.     Mr  P  Jorro  for  the  IAS
      appeared on behalf of the appellant, and  Mrs  M  Tanner  appeared  on
      behalf of the Secretary of State.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Somalia, and  it  is  accepted  that  his
      family belonged to the Yibir which is a  minority  group  in  Somalia.
      His evidence was that his father worked as a blacksmith.     When  the
      civil war broke out in 1990 his family was attacked by members of  the
      majority clan who came to their home and demanded that his father hand
      over his tools.    He was shot dead when he tried to resist  and  also
      the appellant's mother and some of  his  siblings  were  killed.   The
      appellant managed to escape and he was  taken  in  subsequently  by  a
      neighbouring family who were of  the  Habergedir  majority  clan.   He
      lived in Jilib district, in the  mid  Shabelle  region,  part  of  the
      central Jubba region, near Kismayo.    His evidence as to what happens
      thereafter was subject to some slight variations.   At  the  screening
      interview he said that after his parents were killed he was taken by a
      man by force who ordered him to look  after  his  livestock.     In  a
      subsequent rather more detailed form he said  that  when  his  parents
      died his neighbours took him in and he lived with them  until  he  was
      16.    At interview when he was asked about the family which  he  said
      raised him, he said that this was because prior to the war  they  were
      his family's neighbours.     In his statement he said he was taken  in
      by the Habergedir neighbours and lived with them for  many  years  and
      looked after their livestock.   The  Immigration  Judge  concluded  on
      this that the appellant was consistent in all accounts of his evidence
      that following the demise of his parents and some of his  siblings  he
      was "taken  in"  by  a  neighbouring  Habergedir  family.    She  also
      considered that it was consistent with the background information that
      when old enough to do so the  appellant  would  have  worked  for  his
      benefactors which would have provided the only means of survival.

3.   The appellant's evidence was that at 16 he was forcibly recruited  into
      the Habergedir militia on the insistence of the head of the  household
      with which he was living and that he served them for a period of  some
      3 years.   He claimed that he  was  provided  with  a  gun  which  was
      capable of being loaded with 30 bullets although he said  he  did  not
      kill anyone during his time in the militia.

4.   The Immigration Judge did not believe  this  aspect  of  his  evidence.
      She noted that it contrasted with objective evidence in the form of  a
      joint Danish, Finnish, Norwegian and British Fact-Finding  Mission  to
      Nairobi on 7 to 21 January 2004, which among other things stated  that
      although  the  Somali  militias  forcibly  recruited  members  of  the
      minority clans, they were not used as fighters but  rather  they  were
      forced to work for the militias and often would have  to  perform  the
      domestic and menial roles.   In the light of that and  also  the  fact
      that although the appellant claimed to have been involved in  fighting
      for the militia for the 3 year period  he  had  escaped  any  form  of
      injury, the Immigration Judge disbelieved this aspect  of  his  claim.
      She found however that he might  have  had  close  dealings  with  the
      militia in that he may have been  required  to  work  for  them  in  a
      subservient role.   She also referred to his evidence  that  on  three
      occasions he had been threatened  with  death  at  the  hands  of  the
      militia.   His evidence on this had been that twice he was tied up and
      threatened with shooting and the blame for things that had gone  wrong
      was placed at his door and friends of his in the militia intervened on
      his behalf when he  was  released.   He  also  claimed  to  have  been
      arrested on the third occasion and threatened  with  shooting  by  the
      leader of the militia but again was released.   In  relation  to  this
      the Immigration Judge found that while incidents  he  described  might
      have been true, she found that on  each  and  every  occasion  he  was
      released simply by his friends interceding on his behalf which did not
      indicate to her that there was a serious threat to his life.

5.   Thereafter the Immigration Judge found a lack  of  credibility  in  the
      appellant's claim to  have  left  Somalia  for  Ethiopia  having  been
      befriended by an old man who gave him the equivalent of  $4  and  also
      considered the details he gave of how he had survived in Ethiopia were
      very vague.    She did not therefore accept that he left  Somalia  and
      travelled to Ethiopia as claimed.    She concluded that he  had  lived
      with the Habergerdir family in Somalia where he  had  worked  for  the
      family in return for food and clothes but was not  satisfied  that  he
      joined the militia of that clan as a fighting soldier.

6.   She then gave consideration  to  the  guidelines  set  out  in  by  the
      Tribunal in its country guidance case of YS and HA [2005] UKIAT  00088
      and on the basis of her application of those guidelines to  the  facts
      as found by her concluded that the appellant did not face a real  risk
      of persecution or breach of his human rights on return to Somalia.

7.    In  the  grounds  for  reconsideration  it  is  contended   that   the
      Immigration  Judge  had  not  considered  evidence  showing  that  the
      appellant could not regain protection of a dominant  clan,  failed  to
      make findings concerning the treatment should he  refuse  to  serve  a
      dominant clan, and criticised her for failing to make findings  as  to
      the conditions he would face if  he  returned  to  the  service  of  a
      dominant clan.

8.   In his skeleton argument and in his  submissions  before  us  Mr  Jorro
      argued that on the basis  of  the  Immigration  Judge's  findings  the
      appeal should be allowed.    Given  that  she  had  accepted  how  the
      appellant was treated, it was the case that he had been treated  as  a
      slave and had clearly not liked this situation and returning  to  that
      or being killed for refusing would give rise to a real risk of  breach
      of his Article 3 and/or 4 rights  as  well  as  being  persecution  on
      grounds of race.   He took us to paragraph 54 of YS and  HA  where  it
      was said that with regard to the Midgan (we accept that the Yibir  are
      treated in the same way as the Midgan  for  the  reasons  set  out  at
      paragraph 69 of that determination) in some cases the circumstances in
      which they have to perform their occupational work are  tantamount  to
      serfdom or even slavery.    It  is  said  however  that  there  is  no
      evidence that that is the common lot of the Midgan generally  and  for
      most Midgan  it  would  appear  that  although  they  face  widespread
      societal discrimination and work on very disadvantageous terms,  their
      contract to work is voluntary; they are paid  for  the  services  they
      provide and they are able to trade freely.

9.   Mr Jorro argued that was not the case of the appellant in the past  and
      nor would it be on return.   He had worked for the family for  nothing
      and  had  worked  for  the  militia  on  the  same  basis.     He  was
      effectively a serf or a slave.  His position could be contrasted  with
      that of his father who worked as  a  blacksmith  presumably  for  pay,
      albeit low pay.    On the logic of the  Immigration  Judge's  findings
      that he would regain his former position, the only protection he would
      receive was from the very group from which he had escaped and  it  was
      clear from YS and HA that internal relocation was not an option.

10.  In her submissions Mrs Tanner argued that there was  not  an  error  of
      law in the Immigration Judge's determination.   It hinged upon whether
      the appellant would be a slave  or  not.    She  referred  us  to  the
      decision of the House of Lords in Ullah [2004] UKHL 26, where  it  was
      held that there needed to be a flagrant denial of an appellant's human
      rights to give rise to a breach.    The adverse  credibility  findings
      should be borne in mind.    Minority clans who had to live in the  way
      in which the appellant had lived could not be regarded as slaves or at
      risk of persecution.  The Adjudicator was satisfied that the appellant
      was not a slave and nor would he be.   Even if what he would face  was
      harsh and possibly degrading it did not amount to an error of  law  to
      come to the conclusions to which the Immigration Judge had come.

11.  By way of reply, Mr Jorro  argued  that  the  fact  the  appellant  was
      forced to work for nothing was servitude or slavery.   There could  be
      a breach of Article 4, and in that regard he referred us to paragraphs
      16 and 41 of the decision in Ullah where Lord Bingham and  Lord  Steyn
      had considered the point.   The error of law lay  in  the  Immigration
      Judge's failure to allow the appeal.

12.  We  raised  with  the  representatives  whether  the  effect  of  their
      submissions was that either we would have to allow the appeal outright
      as contended for by Mr Jorro or dismiss it outright as  contended  for
      by Mrs Tanner.   It was agreed that the possibility of reconsideration
      was a matter that was before us in the light of the matters raised  in
      the grounds for review and in that regard in particular  we  mentioned
      to the representatives our concern as to an  arguable  lack  of  clear
      findings at paragraph 33 of the determination concerning the nature of
      the work which the Immigration Judge considered the appellant had done
      for the militia.   We then adjourned  the  hearing  to  enable  us  to
      consider the relevant issues.

13.  Although  we  expressed  to  the  representatives  concerns  about  the
      findings of paragraph 33 of  the  determination,  upon  reflection  we
      consider that they can be seen as tied in to  the  objective  evidence
      quoted at paragraph 31 where it is said with regard to the use made by
      Somali militias of members of minority clans that they are not used as
      fighters but rather are forced to work for the militias and often will
      have to perform the domestic and menial roles.   In essence we take it
      that the Immigration Judge  was  paraphrasing  that  evidence  in  her
      findings at paragraph 33.

14.  When one turns to consider the country guidance case in YS and  HA,  it
      is clear that the essential context of that decision was that  of  the
      situation of the minority caste groups vis-�-vis the noble  clans  who
      in general offer  them  protection.   The  essential  reason  for  the
      finding that the minority caste groups are in  general  not  at  risk,
      subject to the  risk  factors  identified  at  paragraph  73  of  that
      determination, is because there is protection from the noble clans  in
      general although clearly in some circumstances that may be lost.

15.  We consider that it is of relevance to note paragraph 54  to  which  Mr
      Jorro took us where the Tribunal  accepted  that  in  some  cases  the
      circumstances in which the  minority  groups  have  to  perform  their
      occupational work are tantamount to serfdom or even  slavery.     This
      is contrasted with the  common  lot  of  the  Midgan  (the  particular
      minority group under consideration, but, as we have  explained  above,
      the determination deals with the minority groups including  the  Yibir
      generally as can be seen from paragraph 69 of the determination).   It
      is said that for most of the  Midgan  although  they  face  widespread
      societal discrimination and work on very disadvantageous terms,  their
      contract work is voluntary;  they  are  paid  for  the  services  they
      provide and they are able to trade freely.

16.  In our view the situation described above can  properly  be  contrasted
      with the situation of a person who is forced to work for a militia and
      has to  perform  domestic  and  menial  services,  summed  up  by  the
      Immigration Judge in her finding that  the  appellant  may  have  been
      required to work for the militia in a  subservient  role.    There  is
      therefore an absence of the limited degree of autonomy in the form  of
      the contract work being voluntary and  being  paid  for  the  services
      provided and the ability to trade freely.   The  particular  situation
      of this appellant is that with regard to his work with the militia  he
      was forced to work for them and perform domestic and menial roles.

17.  The question that then arises  is  whether  facing  this  situation  on
      return if he does face it would give rise a real risk of breach of his
      rights under either Convention.   In this context we note the  finding
      of the IAT in YS and HA at paragraph 73(viii) that a  Midgan  who  has
      lost the protection of local patron (or local patrons) and who had not
      found alternative protection  in  the  city  would  be  vulnerable  to
      persecution.   And also at (ix) it is said that a Midgan who has  lost
      protection from a noble clan patron or patrons in his home area  would
      not be able to relocate safely within Somalia.

18.  We have concluded that, on the Immigration  Judge's  findings,  in  the
      context of what was said by the IAT in YS  and  HA  at  paragraph  54,
      following its careful assessment of  the  relevant  expert  and  other
      objective evidence, that the appellant faces a real risk of inhuman or
      degrading  treatment  if  returned  to   Somalia,   where   the   only
      "protection" he could expect to find would take the form of, at  least
      forced labour, if  not  servitude  at  the  hands  of  the  Habergedir
      militia.  He has made out his claim under Articles  3  and  4  of  the
      Human Rights Convention and under the Refugee Convention.  We conclude
      that the Immigration Judge materially erred in law in finding that  he
      was not at risk on return, and for her decision dismissing the  appeal
      is substituted a decision that the appeal is allowed.
