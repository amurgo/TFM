                                     and

                THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms L Irvine, instructed by Latta & Co solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs O'Brien Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


           DECISION MADE PURSUANT TO RULES 34, 39 & 40 (3) OF THE
               TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL) RULES 2008

   1. The appellant appeals with permission  against  the  decision  of  the
      Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Murray promulgated  on  28
      December 2017.


   2. It was agreed between the parties that, for the reasons set out in the
      grounds of appeal, and the grant of permission, that the  decision  of
      the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error of law.


   3. Rule 40 (1) of the Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
      provided that the Upper Tribunal may  give  a  decision  orally  at  a
      hearing which I did to the  effect  that  the  decision  did,  as  the
      respondent properly conceded, involve the making of an error of law. I
      was satisfied also that as the errors were such that none of the facts
      found  could  be  preserved,  that  it  was  appropriate  in  all  the
      circumstances to remit the  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for
      fresh findings to be made on all issues.


   4. Rule 40 (3) provides that the  Upper  Tribunal  must  provide  written
      reasons for its decision with a decision  notice  unless  the  parties
      have consented to the Upper Tribunal not giving written reasons. I  am
      satisfied that the parties have given such consent at the hearing.


      Notice of Decision

   1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law and is set aside.

   2. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  to  be  remade  in  its
      entirety. None of the findings made by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are
      preserved.

   3. The appeal must not be heard by Designated Judge Murray.


      Signed                       Date: 26 October 2018
