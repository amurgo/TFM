                                AR and Others
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The linked appeals of AR and his family were heard by Upper  Tribunal
       Judge C. Lane on the 5th April 2017.  Judge Lane, in his decision  of
       the 24th April 2017, found the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       (Judge Caswell) to contain an error of law such that it must  be  set
       aside. The error was in the First-tier  Tribunal's  approach  to  the
       question of Article 15(c), and specifically whether Judge Caswell had
       dealt properly with the country background  evidence  on  Libya.  The
       appeals were then adjourned pending the  promulgation  of  the  Upper
       Tribunal's decision in the country guidance on this matter.

    2. The country guidance case of ZMM (Article 15(c)) Libya CG [2017] UKUT
       00263 (IAC) was  published  on  the  29th  June  2018.  The  material
       guidance is:

           "The violence in Libya  has  reached  such  a  high  level  that
           substantial grounds are shown for  believing  that  a  returning
           civilian would,  solely  on  account  of  his  presence  on  the
           territory of that country or region, face a real risk  of  being
           subject to a threat to his life or person."

    3. On the 13th March 2018 I gave directions in the following terms:

           "In light of the country guidance in ZMM (Libya) it would appear
           that the Appellants should all succeed on Article 15(c) grounds.
             Unless the Tribunal receives, no later than 4pm  on  the  19th
           March 2017, submissions to the  contrary  or  a  request  for  a
           further oral hearing, the appeal will be allowed on  that  basis
           without a further hearing"

       To date no representations have been received.

    4. I find that the Appellants are all nationals of Libya.  Applying  the
       guidance in ZMM (Article 15(c)) Libya  CG  [2017]  UKUT  00263  (IAC)
       their linked appeals are each allowed on protection grounds.

       Anonymity

    5. These linked appeals concerns claims  for  international  protection.
       Having had regard  to  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
       Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013:
       Anonymity Orders I therefore consider it appropriate to make an order
       in the following terms:

           "Unless and until a tribunal or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
           Appellants  are  granted  anonymity.    No   report   of   these
           proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  any  of  the
           Appellants or  any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
           applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the  Appellants  and   the
           Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead to
           contempt of court proceedings"

       Decisions

    6. The appeals are allowed on protection grounds.

    7. There is an order for anonymity.

                                                             20th March 2018
