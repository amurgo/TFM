                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Hiren Patel, Solicitor, Hiren Patel Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal holding that he had  no  valid  appeal  before  the
    Tribunal, and that he had no jurisdiction to hear  his  appeal  against
    the decision by the respondent to refuse to vary his leave to remain as
    a Tier 1 (General) Student Migrant, and against a concomitant  decision
    to  remove  him  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant's application form in the respondent's bundle is  stamped
    as having been received by the UK Border Agency on 12  June  2013.   At
    the beginning of the form, the following is stated:

         "This is your official document for your application.  You need  to
         submit this to us by post in order to make your application."

 3. Page 10 of the application form contained the applicant's  declaration.
    This was purportedly signed by the appellant on 20 April 2013.

 4. Page 11 of the application form contains the following instructions:

         "Next steps for your application.

         Collate your supporting documents together and post them with  your
         official document to [the UK Border Agency].

         If you use recorded or special  delivery,  this  will  help  us  to
         record the receipt of your document and supporting documents.  Make
         sure that you keep the recorded or special delivery number.

         What happens next?

         We will write to you if any of the  required  supporting  documents
         are missing or unsuitable ... final checks for your application.

         To ensure that  your  application  is  complete,  please  make  the
         following final checks.  Tick each box that  is  relevant  to  your
         application ... if you fail to include all parts  your  application
         may become invalid."

 5. For present purposes, it is convenient to note  that  the  three  boxes
    that  were  required  to  be  ticked  under  "final  checks  for   your
    application" are not ticked in the appellant's application form.

 6. On 30 September 2012 the  Secretary  of  State  gave  her  reasons  for
    refusing the application.  His leave to enter had expired on  20  April
    2013 but he had not submitted a valid application for leave  to  remain
    until 11 June 2013.  It was more than 28 days after the date  that  his
    previous leave to enter expired.   His  application  fell  for  refusal
    under paragraph 245ZX(m).  It also fell to be refused  under  paragraph
    245ZX(d) with reference to paragraphs 1A and 11 of Appendix  C  of  the
    Rules.  This was because the bank statements submitted  in  support  of
    his application needed to show evidence of �9,500  maintenance  for  28
    days.  However the bank statement to  support  his  application  showed
    that he had held not more than �1,721.67 for more  than  one  day.   As
    such, he had not demonstrated that he had the levels of funds  required
    over the specified 28 day period to be granted as a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student Migrant.

 7. The appellant filed extensive grounds  of  appeal  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.   He  was  assisted  by  SRIT  Service   in   preparing   his
    application.  They confirmed that they prepared his application and had
    posted it to UKBA.  He had handed over all his documents in April 2013.

 8. On 9 May 2013 he received an email from SRIT  Services  asking  him  to
    sign his application, and send it back by email.  He had done that  the
    next day, on 10 May 2013.

 9. They had already asked him to provide his card  details  for  the  Home
    Office fee, and he had provided such details.  On 10 May 2013 UKBA  had
    deducted �406 from his account.  So he was under  the  impression  that
    his advisors had submitted his application on  the  same  day  and  "in
    time".  But his advisors did  not  provide  him  with  any  Royal  Mail
    receipt.

10. He finally received the refusal  letter  that  had  been  sent  to  his
    previous address and he realised that his application had actually been
    posted on  11  June  2013.   He  had  been  under  the  impression  his
    application was posted on 9 May 2013, and that fees were deducted on 10
    May 2013.  He submitted he should be granted a right of appeal, relying
    on Basnet (validity of application  -  Respondent)  [2012]  UKUT  00113
    (IAC).

11. In response to the grounds of appeal, the  Duty  Judge  made  a  Basnet
    direction.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

12. The appellant's appeal came before Designated Judge French  sitting  at
    Birmingham.  Mr Graham of Counsel appeared on behalf of the  appellant,
    and Mr Lawson, Home Office Presenting Officer, appeared  on  behalf  of
    the respondent.  At the outset of the hearing, Mr Lawson apologised for
    the fact that the Basnet direction had not been complied with.  But  he
    handed in a computerised report headed "CID notes" which indicated  the
    application had been received on 11 June 2013, the  date  mentioned  in
    the refusal letter.  Mr Lawson said there was no trace of  any  earlier
    application.  Mr Graham for his part accepted that if the appellant did
    not have an established presence as a student, he would not  have  able
    to demonstrate that he had the required funds.

13. The judge adjourned the hearing for a short period for  both  advocates
    to consider the available evidence, and for Mr Lawson  to  confirm  the
    amount which would have been required if the appellant had  shown  that
    he had an established presence as a student, and therefore he only  had
    to satisfy a lower maintenance requirement.

14. When the hearing resumed, Mr Lawson said that the appellant would  have
    needed �2,500 if he had an established presence, and that  he  had  not
    been able to demonstrate that he held that sum.

15.  The  appellant  gave  oral  evidence.   He  said  he  had  signed  the
    application form on 20 April 2013  and he had left it with the agent to
    lodge.  He had paid him a  fee,  and  had  left  details  of  his  bank
    account.  The agent  had  said  the  bank  statement  he  provided  was
    sufficient.  He accepted that he had not been able  to  show  that  the
    application had been received within 28 days of 20 April; and  when  he
    received the ultimate refusal letter from the respondent,  he  knew  it
    must have been submitted in June.  He was aware that he only  ever  had
    temporary leave and he still had some family in India.   His  intention
    had been to study for a further two years  in  this  country  and  then
    return.

16. In his closing submissions,  Mr  Lawson  submitted  that  even  if  the
    application had been received in time, the appellant did not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules as the maximum amount  he  ever  had  in  his
    account was �1,721.67 and the statement submitted was over 28 days  old
    as of 20 April 2013.

17. In reply, Mr Graham said the situation was  difficult.   It  looked  as
    though the appellant had been badly let down by  his  former  advisors,
    but he had acted in good faith.  The fact that the fee had  been  taken
    from his account went to establish the application had been  lodged  in
    time and it was confusing how that fee had been taken.  The  CID  notes
    had no record of a fee being paid.  The appellant accepted that he  had
    been advised wrongly and that the funds in the  account  had  not  been
    sufficient.

18. Judge French set out his findings in paragraph  11  of  his  subsequent
    determination.  There was no evidence at all that the application  form
    dated 20 April 2013 was received by the  respondent  on  the  following
    day, or at all until 11 June.  He noted that �406  was  withdrawn  from
    the appellant's bank account on 10  May  2013  but  the  appellant  had
    explained how he  had  given  details  of  that  account  to  his  then
    representative and the judge found on the balance of probabilities that
    it was not established an application was lodged prior to 11 June 2013.
     The consequence was the application was not made until the appellant's
    leave had expired.  Even the period of grace of 28 days now adopted did
    not assist him.  He had no right of appeal.

19. The judge went on to say that even if a valid application had been made
    what was before the Secretary of State did  not  demonstrate  that  the
    appellant  had  the  necessary  level  of  funds  even  if  he  had  an
    established presence.  The bank statement submitted also fell short  of
    what was required.   The  appellant  would  not  have  succeeded  under
    Article 8  in  the  light  of  recent  case  law.   There  was  nothing
    exceptional or compelling about his case.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

20. On 25 June 2014 Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge Zucker granted the
    appellant permission to appeal for the following reasons:

         2.   The grounds submit that having regard to guidance in the  case
             of Basnet (validity of application - Respondent)  [2010]  UKUT
             00113 the judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight  to
             the fact the respondent had failed to comply  with  directions
             in respect to when any fee was received  from  the  appellant,
             given in particular those matters set out at  paragraph  5  of
             the grounds the additional documentation and the  guidance  in
             MM (unfairness; E&R) Sudan [2014] UKUT 00105 (IAC), permission
             is granted.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

21. At the hearing before me, Mr Patel advanced a case that was  materially
    at variance with the case advanced by  Mr  Graham  of  Counsel  at  the
    hearing.  As the case which was  being  put  relied  upon  a  different
    evidential foundation from that upon which the First-tier Tribunal  had
    proceeded and at the same time procedural unfairness on MM grounds  was
    being asserted, I found it convenient to  receive  some  oral  evidence
    from the appellant on the issues in controversy de bene esse.

22. Mr Patel's case with regard to the lodging of the application was  that
    the appellant's advisors had made an online  application  on  20  April
    2013.  He submitted that this was apparent from the  application  form,
    from which I have quoted earlier in this  determination.   Although  it
    was accepted that the documents accompanying the application form,  and
    the hard copy of the signed application form, had not been posted until
    some time later, applying paragraph 34G  of  the  Rules,  the  date  of
    application should be treated as the date of the online application  on
    20 April 2013.

23. In his oral evidence before me, the appellant initially stated that  he
    had signed the application form in May 2013, but had backdated it to 20
    April 2013 on instructions from his advisors.  He then said that he had
    signed the form on 20 April 2013, and had also signed another  copy  of
    the form in May 2013.  On the second occasion, he had not  put  in  the
    date, but had left it blank.

24. On the question of maintenance, Mr Patel's case was that the judge  had
    erred in law in not taking into account the documentary evidence of the
    savings jointly held by the appellant with other family members in  the
    Bank of Baroda.  This evidence had been including  in  the  appellant's
    bundle. In his signed witness statement for the hearing in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal the appellant had said at paragraph 14 that he  had  sent
    this documentary evidence to the Home Office on 24 September 2013.  His
    explanation for this was that his wife had  suggested  that  he  should
    send some additional funding documents.  In his  oral  evidence  before
    me, the appellant said that his wife had made this suggestion in  about
    June 2013.

Discussion

25. The most troubling aspect of  this  case  is  that  a  fee,  apparently
    corresponding to that which  the  appellant  was  liable  to  pay,  was
    deducted from his bank account on 10 May 2013.  The additional evidence
    referred to by Designated Judge Zucker when granting permission is that
    of the appellant's bank statements for the period 2 April  2013  to  16
    November 2013 showing that no fee was subsequently deducted.   So,  the
    argument runs, the probability is that the fee which was deducted on 10
    May 2013 relates to the appellant's application,  not  someone  else's,
    because if that was the case, there would have been a further deduction
    by UKBA from the appellant's account at a later date.

26. However Judge French noted that the CID notes did not have a record  of
    any fee being paid.  Nonetheless, as he was well aware, the  respondent
    entertained the application to the extent  that  she  gave  a  reasoned
    decision as to why she was  refusing  it  -  and  why  she  was  making
    directions for the appellant's removal.  The SSHD does  not  require  a
    person whom she is proposing to remove to pay a fee as  a  precondition
    of making a removal decision or direction against that person.  So  the
    additional evidence relied on in the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  does
    not, on analysis, constitute a  compelling  rebuttal  of  the  position
    taken by the judge below.

27. If Mr Walker accepted that the appellant's advisors had made an  online
    application on his  behalf  on  20  April  2013,  this  would  arguably
    disclose an error of law on the  grounds  that  Judge  French  made  an
    agreed mistake of fact on a material matter.  But Mr Walker  reasonably
    does not agree with the  factual  proposition  advanced  by  Mr  Patel.
    Until  now,  the  appellant  has  consistently  maintained   that   the
    application was lodged by post, and  it  has  not  been  satisfactorily
    established by way of appeal that the  application  was  in  fact  made
    online on 20 April 2013.

28. Moreover, the application form in  the  respondent's  bundle  expressly
    states that the application will not be deemed to be made until  it  is
    posted.  It is necessary to draw a  distinction  between  the  advisors
    downloading a pro-forma document from the internet on  20  April  2013,
    and actually making an online application on that day, the  application
    form having been completed and signed by the appellant.

29. Furthermore, the appellant's oral evidence on this topic before me  was
    confused  and  unsatisfactory,  and  inconsistent  with   his   earlier
    evidence. He plainly represented in his witness  statement  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal that he did not sign an application  form  until  9
    May 2013, and that he sent  it  back  by  email  to  SRIT  Service  for
    posting.

30. As I canvassed in the course of oral argument, this was never a classic
    Basnet case.  The respondent had not rejected any  application  by  the
    appellant on grounds of invalidity, and in particular on the grounds of
    non-payment of the specified fee.  Although compliance with the  Basnet
    direction was tardy, there was compliance in  that  Mr  Lawson  at  the
    hearing produced the CID notes which evidenced when the application had
    been received.  So, insofar as the burden rested with the respondent to
    show that the application had not been submitted prior to 11 June 2013,
    the respondent had discharged that burden.  Conversely,  the  appellant
    had not brought forward satisfactory evidence which showed that the CID
    notes were wrong or incomplete, and that in fact  the  application  had
    been posted (or indeed made online) before 11 June 2013.

31. So I find that there was no error of law  in  the  judge  reaching  the
    conclusion that the appellant had not discharged the burden of  proving
    that he had made an application before the  expiry  of  his  leave,  or
    alternatively within 28 days of his leave expiring.

32. The appellant was not in any  event  driven  from  the  judgment  seat,
    because the judge also considered what the position would have been  if
    the appellant was treated as having made an in-time application.

33. Since the appellant was represented by Counsel, there was no procedural
    unfairness in the judge not taking into account the appellant's savings
    in India when making a finding that the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    maintenance  requirement,  even  if  he  was  treated  as   having   an
    established  presence  as  a  student.   For  appellant's  Counsel  had
    conceded this point.

34. Mr Patel was perplexed as to why Counsel had made this concession, when
    the appellant relied on the  savings  in  his  witness  statement,  and
    claimed  that  the  documentary  evidence  had  been  provided  to  the
    respondent before the date of decision.

35. Mr Patel overlooks the fact  that  the  appellant  gave  oral  evidence
    before Counsel made  the  concession.   On  the  account  of  his  oral
    evidence given by Judge French at paragraph 8 of his determination,  an
    account which is not challenged as inaccurate, the  appellant  did  not
    give oral evidence to the same effect as that set out  in  his  witness
    statement on the topic of the Indian bank statements.  The  line  taken
    in his oral evidence, as summarised by the judge, was  simply  that  he
    had followed the advice of his agent that he needed to have the sum  of
    �1,600 in his bank account, and that he tried to maintain  that  level.
    So on the evidence which was actually led from the  appellant,  he  was
    not asserting that he had decided  at  the  eleventh  hour  to  provide
    additional evidence of funding to the Home Office.

36. Moreover, as this evidence had not been provided with the  application,
    it was not evidence that the  respondent  was  required  to  take  into
    account, having regard to paragraph 245AA of the Rules.  Accordingly, I
    am not persuaded that Counsel's concession that the appellant  did  not
    meet the maintenance requirement was not properly given.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain  an  error  of  law,
and this appeal to the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed.
