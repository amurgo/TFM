Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr K Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms K Reid, Counsel instructed by Charles Simmons
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. By my decision promulgated on 15 April 2016 (appended to this
      decision) the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Phillips
      promulgated on 17 September 2015 was set aside. I hereby remake the
      decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
   2. The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is a citizen of the United
      States, born on 11 November 1965, whose application for leave to
      remain in the UK on the basis of his family life with his same sex
      partner was refused by the appellant (hereinafter "the Secretary of
      State") in a decision dated 10 June 2014.


   3. The claimant argues that his removal would be contrary to Article 8
      ECHR. He does not contend that he is able to satisfy the requirements
      of the Immigration Rules.

 Factual findings

   4. Having considered the documents that were before the First Tier
      Tribunal, a small bundle of further documents adduced at the hearing
      by the claimant (Mr Norton not objecting to their admission), and the
      oral evidence of the claimant and his partner, my factual findings are
      as follows:

   5. The claimant and his British national partner have been in a
      relationship since February 2010 and entered into a civil partnership
      on 25 June 2013. They live together and are in a genuine relationship.




   6. Throughout 2011 and 2012 the claimant entered the UK regularly as a
      visitor. In January 2013 he was granted entry clearance as a Tier 5 TW
      (CRE Sport) Migrant with leave until 25 September 2013. On 26
      September 2013 and then again on 2 November 2013 he was granted leave
      to enter at port as a visitor for 6 months. The application that gave
      rise to this appeal was made on 10 April 2014, whilst the claimant was
      in the UK as a visitor.


   7. The claimant is an accomplished professional musician. He has not been
      working in the UK for the last several years because of his
      immigration status. Evidence was submitted to show, and on the balance
      of probabilities I find, that there are several potential employers
      who would, if permitted to do so, engage his services. When he was
      working in the UK for a brief period in 2013 under a Tier 5 visa he
      was earning ï¿½1,500 a week.


   8. The claimant's partner has a number of physical and mental health
      problems and does not work. He is in receipt of benefits. A letter
      from his GP refers to him suffering from chronic depression and
      anxiety as well as suffering disability from a swollen leg. He is
      under the care of the vascular team at Chelsea and Westminster
      hospital for venous stasis of lower legs resulting in chronic venous
      ulcers. He has been treated for avascular necrosis. A letter dated 11
      August 2016 from his therapist refers to him having severe separation
      anxiety, resulting in chronic depression, anxiety, and suicidal
      tendencies when separated from his partner.


   9. The claimant's partner has a close relationship with his elderly
      grandparents and his mother and a strong wish to remain in the UK with
      his family and friends, where he can continue to access his ongoing
      medical care.


 Consideration


  10. Where a person seeks limited leave to remain in the UK as a partner
      under the Immigration Rules, he must meet the requirements set out in
      Appendix FM. These include a number of eligibility requirements, one
      of which is that the applicant must not be in the UK as a visitor when
      the application was made. The claimant was in the UK as a visitor and
      therefore, for this reason alone, his application could not succeed
      under the Rules. This was not in dispute and both parties recognised
      that this appeal could only succeed on the basis that removal of the
      claimant from the UK would be contrary to Article 8 ECHR outwith the
      Immigration Rules.


  11. Before turning to consider Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, it is
      instructive to consider what would have been the case had the claimant
      made his application at a time he did not have the immigration status
      of a visitor (for example, if the application had been made a year
      earlier, when he was in the UK under a Tier 5 visa) and had not fallen
      foul of the eligibility requirements in Appendix FM. As the claimant
      could not meet the financial requirements set out in paragraph E-
      LTRP3.1-3.4, his appeal would have fallen to be determined under
      Section EX.1(b). Section EX.1(b) applies if:
         the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection, and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.
  12. It is not disputed that the claimant and his civil partner are in a
      genuine and subsisting relationship. Accordingly, the sole question at
      issue under the Rules would have been whether there were
      insurmountable obstacles to family life with his partner continuing in
      the USA.


  13. The phrase insurmountable obstacles is defined at Section E.X.2 as
      follows:

         For the purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b) "insurmountable obstacles"
         means the very significant difficulties which would be faced by the
         applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
         outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail very
         serious hardship for the applicant or their partner.


  14. The Court of Appeal in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 explained the
      phrase in the following way:
        21.The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" as used in this paragraph
        of the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by an
        applicant for leave to remain under the Rules. The test is
        significantly more demanding than a mere test of whether it would
        be reasonable to expect a couple to continue their family life
        outside the United Kingdom.
        22.This interpretation is in line with the relevant Strasbourg
        jurisprudence. The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" has its origin
        in the Strasbourg jurisprudence in relation to immigration cases in
        a family context, where it is mentioned as one factor among others
        to be taken into account in determining whether any right under
        Article 8 exists for family members to be granted leave to remain
        or leave to enter a Contracting State: see e.g. Rodrigues da Silva
        and Hoogkamer v Netherlands (2007) 44 EHRR 34, para. [39] ("...
        whether there are insurmountable obstacles in the way of the family
        living together in the country of origin of one or more of them
        ..."). The phrase as used in the Rules is intended to have the same
        meaning as in the Strasbourg jurisprudence. It is clear that the
        ECtHR regards it as a formulation imposing a stringent test in
        respect of that factor, as is illustrated by Jeunesse v
        Netherlands (see para. [117]: there were no insurmountable
        obstacles to the family settling in Suriname, even though the
        applicant and her family would experience hardship if forced to do
        so).
        23.For clarity, two points should be made about the "insurmountable
        obstacles" criterion. First, although it involves a stringent test,
        it is obviously intended in both the case-law and the Rules to be
        interpreted in a sensible and practical rather than a purely
        literal way: see, e.g., the way in which the Grand Chamber
        approached that criterion in Jeunesse v Netherlands at para. [117];
        also the observation by this court in MF (Nigeria) v Secretary of
        State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192; [2014] 1 WLR
        544, at [49] (although it should be noted that the passage in the
        judgment of the Upper Tribunal in Izuazu v Secretary of State for
        the Home Department [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC); [2013] Imm AR 453 there
        referred to, at paras. [53]-[59], was making a rather different
        point, namely that explained in para. [24] below regarding the
        significance of the criterion in the context of an Article 8
        assessment).
        24.Secondly, the "insurmountable obstacles" criterion is used in
        the Rules to define one of the preconditions set out in section
        EX.1(b) which need to be satisfied before an applicant can claim to
        be entitled to be granted leave to remain under the Rules. In that
        context, it is not simply a factor to be taken into account.
        However, in the context of making a wider Article 8 assessment
        outside the Rules, it is a factor to be taken into account, not an
        absolute requirement which has to be satisfied in every single case
        across the whole range of cases covered by Article 8: see paras.
        [29]-[30] below
  15. Having regard to the definition of insurmountable obstacles in Section
      EX.2 and to the Court of Appeal's recent discussion of the term in
      Agyarko, I am satisfied that this is a case where there are
      "insurmountable obstacles" to family life between the claimant and his
      partner continuing outside the UK.


  16. The evidence before me, which I accept, is that the claimant's partner
      has significant mental health problems. A recent letter from his
      therapist referred to him suffering from chronic depression and
      suicidal tendencies, as well as separation anxiety. He also has a
      range of physical problems for which he is receiving ongoing
      specialist medical care. In his oral evidence the claimant's partner
      described being apart from the claimant as devastating. Yet, despite
      the anxiety separation provokes, he thought that because of his
      medical conditions he would not be in a position to accompany the
      claimant to the USA.


  17. Insurmountable obstacles is a high threshold to meet. In my judgment,
      it is met in this case because the claimant's partner has a range of
      physical and mental health problems which, taken together, effectively
      preclude him from moving to the USA with the claimant or which mean
      that, if he were, despite these problems, to move to the USA, doing so
      would entail very serious hardship.


  18. In addition to his medical conditions, the claimant raised a number of
      other issues relevant to whether his partner should have to leave the
      UK in order to continue his relationship. These are that the
      claimant's partner is a British citizen who is close to his elderly
      grandparents, he strongly wishes to continue to live in his own
      country, and his life would be severely disrupted by moving to the
      USA. As Agyarko makes clear, such factors do not constitute
      insurmountable obstacles. It is the claimant's partner's medical
      conditions (both physical and mental) that give rise, in this case, to
      insurmountable obstacles.


  19. As explained previously, the claimant cannot succeed under the
      Immigration Rules because he was a visitor when he made the
      application. Accordingly, the only route open to him to obtain leave
      to remain as a partner is under Article 8 outside the Rules.

  20. The claimant's relationship was formed and developed whilst his
      immigration status was precarious. In such circumstances, his removal
      will be disproportionate only in exceptional circumstances. My
      starting point in considering whether the circumstances are
      exceptional is to observe that this is a case where, for the reasons I
      have given, there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
      continuing outside the UK. Whilst this is not determinative under
      Article 8, it is a highly material consideration. As explained in
      Nagre [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin):

         The approach explained in the Strasbourg case-law indicates that
         where family life is established when the immigration status of the
         claimant is precarious, removal will be disproportionate only in
         exceptional cases; and also that consideration of whether there are
         insurmountable obstacles to the claimant's resident spouse or
         partner relocating to the claimant's country of origin to continue
         their family life there will be a highly material consideration.
         (emphasis added)

  21. I recognise that the Immigration Rules do not allow people in the UK
      as visitors to be granted leave to remain as a partner under Appendix
      FM even if there are insurmountable obstacles to family life
      continuing outside the UK and that this is a reflection of the public
      interest in not allowing people to switch category from a visitor.
      That the claimant applied whist a visitor therefore heightens the
      public interest consideration in the maintenance of effective
      immigration controls.


  22. However, in undertaking the balancing exercise under Article 8 a wider
      consideration of the public interest is required. The evidence before
      me, which I accept, is that if the claimant's immigration status
      enabled him to work in the UK he would, on the balance of
      probabilities, secure high paying work. When he last worked in the UK
      he earned ï¿½1,500 a week and there are several potential employers keen
      to engage his services. Whilst this does not lessen the importance of
      the maintenance of effective immigration control it does have some
      relevance to the overall public interest question in this case.



  23. Applying the factors in 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and
      Asylum Act 2002 to this appeal I find as follows:


      a) The public interest in the maintenance of effective immigration
         control is engaged, and indeed is of particular significance
         because the Immigration Rules are designed to prevent people
         applying for leave as a partner whilst in the UK as a visitor.


      b) The claimant speaks English and will be financially independent.
         Indeed, I find that not only is the claimant likely to not be a
         burden on the tax payer, he is likely to be a financial asset to
         the UK.


      c) The claimant's family life was entered into when his immigration
         status was precarious. Whilst the case law makes clear that little
         weight can be given to family life arising in such circumstances, a
         highly relevant consideration is whether there are insurmountable
         obstacles to that life continuing outside the UK.


  24. I am satisfied, having balanced the insurmountable obstacles the
      claimant and his partner face in relocating to the USA to continue
      their family life against the public interest in effective immigration
      control, that this an exceptional case where removal of claimant from
      the UK would be disproportionate even though his family life was
      established when his immigration status was precarious.

Decision

25. The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules.

26. The appeal is allowed under Article 8 ECHR.
