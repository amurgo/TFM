                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This appeal is not subject to an  anonymity  order  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal pursuant to rule 13  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier
    Tribunal) (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) Rules  2014.  Neither  party
    has invited me to make an anonymity order pursuant to rule  14  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (SI  2008/2698)  and  I
    have not done so.

 2. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge Cox) dismissing the appellant's appeal against a decision  taken
    on 27 March 2015 to refuse further  leave  to  remain  under  paragraph
    245ZX(c) of the Immigration Rules  ("the  Rules")  and  to  remove  the
    appellant from the UK.

Introduction

 3. The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  born  in  1990.  He  made  an
    application on 10 April 2014 for further leave to remain in the UK as a
    Tier 4 general migrant. That was based upon a  CAS  for  a  Diploma  in
    Leadership and Management at Kinnaird College. The sponsor licence  for
    Kinnaird College was revoked on 25 June  2014  and  the  appellant  was
    given 60 days to submit a fresh application on  21  January  2015.  The
    appellant subsequently did so.

 4. The Secretary of State decided on 27 March 2015 that the CAS  submitted
    with the application was assigned by the London School of Business  and
    Finance ("LSBF"). The Tier 4 sponsor register was checked on  27  March
    2015 and LSBF was not listed as a Tier 4 sponsor as of that  date.  The
    refusal letter states that the appellant was informed  of  that  on  21
    January 2015 and allowed 60 days to obtain a new sponsor.  No  new  CAS
    had been provided. As the appellant was not in possession  of  a  valid
    CAS his application was refused.

The Appeal

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and  his  appeal  was
    listed for oral hearing in Birmingham IAC on 19 August 2015. He was not
    represented and did not attend. The First-tier Tribunal found that  the
    appellant had submitted a CAS with his application that was  issued  by
    LSBF. That turned out not to be valid because LSBF was not on the  Tier
    4 sponsor register as of 27 March 2015. The  appellant's  position  was
    quite hopeless and the appeal was dismissed.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 6. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis that the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law because he did  not
    know about the LSBF CAS and the respondent was clearly unaware  of  his
    true circumstances. He was sick on 19 August 2015 and had requested  an
    adjournment.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Mailer
    on January 2016. It was arguable that the incorrect sponsor was  relied
    upon by the respondent and the appeal was  arguably  dismissed  on  the
    wrong basis. The CAS apparently relied upon was for Kinnaird College.

 8. In a rule 24 response dated 8 February 2016  the  respondent  submitted
    that the respondent gave the appellant 60 days on 21  January  2015  to
    find a new Tier 4 sponsor and CAS. Even if the  respondent  erroneously
    referred to LSBF it still did not appear that the appellant had found a
    new sponsor.

 9. Thus, the appeal came before me

Discussion

10. Mr Garrod submitted that there was a clear error of  law  in  that  the
    judge accepted that the appellant had relied upon a CAS from  LSBF.  In
    fact, the CAS from LSBF was from 2011. The appellant  was  at  Kinnaird
    College and could not get a new CAS because the respondent thought that
    he already had a CAS.

11. Mr Kandola submitted that the CAS may relate to the appellant  but  the
    case turns on whether Kinnaird College was a valid college on 27  March
    2015. If it was then the decision was not in accordance with  the  law.
    That had not been shown today. In any event  the  appellant  failed  to
    supply a valid CAS within 60 days.

12. I find that the refusal letter of 27 March 2015 refers to  a  submitted
    CAS from LSBF. That is incorrect, the only CAS  from  LSBF  dates  from
    2011. The judge erred at paragraph 4 of the decision  by  finding  that
    the CAS submitted with the latest application was assigned by LSBF. The
    error  is  material  because  the  appellant's  application  was  never
    considered on the correct factual  basis  by  the  respondent  and  the
    judge.

13. The appellant's case, as set out in his witness statement of  11  March
    2016 appears to be that he could  not  obtain  a  new  CAS  because  he
    already had a CAS from Kinnaird College. He had  sufficient  funds  and
    completed his MA from Anglia Ruskin University whilst  his  appeal  was
    pending. He did  successfully  obtain  an  offer  letter  from  another
    college which was submitted within the 60 day period permitted  by  the
    respondent. That factual basis for the  varied  application  has  never
    been considered by the respondent.

14. Thus, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the  appellant's
    appeal under the Rules involved the making of an error of law  and  its
    decision cannot stand.

Decision

15. Consequently, I set aside the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.  I
    remake the decision by finding that the  respondent's  decision  of  27
    March 2015 was not in accordance with the law to  the  extent  that  no
    valid decision  has  yet  been  made  in  respect  of  the  appellant's
    application. A fresh decision must be made in due course.


Signed                          Date 14 May 2016
