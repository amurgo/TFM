                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                       ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER, KENYA

                                                                  Respondent
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The ECO refused entry clearance for reasons  explained  in  a  decision
    dated 18 January 2013.   The appellant filed grounds of appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Burns  dismissed  her
    appeal for reasons explained in his determination promulgated on 28 May
      2014.  The appellant filed grounds of appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    The ECO filed a response to the grant  of  permission,  dated  22  July
    2014.  The Upper Tribunal issued a note and directions  on  27  October
    2014.  The case then came before me.

 2. The sponsor is Mr A Kiedthy, the appellant's father.  There is on  file
    an e-mail from him dated 5 December 2014 asking if he may represent his
    daughter, because the previous representatives no  longer  act  in  the
    case and for financial reasons he has  been  unable  to  arrange  other
    legal representation.  He  was  present  on  7  January  2015.   Mrs  M
    O'Brien, Senior  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer,  appeared  for  the
    respondent.

 3. In the circumstances, I told the sponsor that I would firstly hear  the
    Presenting Officer's response to the Grounds of Appeal, and  then  give
    him the opportunity to make his submissions.

 4. Mrs O'Brien pointed out that the judge found in favour of the appellant
    on the requirements  of  paragraph  297(i)  of  the  Rules.   The  only
    outstanding issue in  respect  of  the  Rules  was  the  refusal  under
    paragraph 320(7A).   She  submitted  further  as  follows.   The  judge
    correctly took the standard of proof to be the balance of  probability,
    the authority being Re B (Children) [2008] UKHL 35,  [2009]  1  AC  11.
    Although the ECO's decision referred to a higher standard, that was  an
    error derived from  following  an  out-of-date  decision  format.   The
    refusal under paragraph 320(7A) was mandatory, so there was no error in
    the outcome under the Rules.  As to  Article  8,  the  appellant  might
    query the finding at paragraph 44  that  family  life  did  not  exist.
    However, the family life had consisted only of some  financial  support
    and very intermittent  contact,  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal having been of only two visits  over  the  years.   The  ECO's
    decision did not interfere with such family life as there was.   Father
    and daughter did not appear ever to have lived  together.  Family  life
    between appellant and sponsor having been minimal,  any  error  on  the
    point was immaterial.  The Article 8 outcome would  inevitably  be  the
    same, so the determination should stand.

 5. The sponsor said that he has always been in contact with his  daughter,
    and has given her full support over the years.  He left  Tanzania  when
    she was aged 3.  She was then living with her mother and not with  him,
    but family circumstances were  such  that  his  financial  support  was
    needed.  He has four children: a daughter aged 21 living in Kenya,  the
    full sister of the appellant;  the  appellant;  a  half-sister  of  the
    appellant, aged 10, living with her mother in Scotland but not with the
    sponsor; and another half-sister aged 2ï¿½, living with the sponsor.  The
    appellant and her half-siblings in this country have  never  met.   The
    sponsor has sent contributions to his children in Kenya ever  since  he
    came to the UK.  He visited in 2003, 2006, 2007,  2011  and  2013.   He
    usually went for about three weeks, spending  at  least  two  of  those
    weeks with the appellant, except in 2011 when he was able to spend only
    two days.  He had produced records of school fees paid  in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  He had with him a further bundle of receipts  for  such
    payments.

 6. Regarding the letter from Mr Ben Shapaye, the  document  questioned  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, the sponsor had written to the Upper  Tribunal
    on 11 December 2014.  His letter says that he has been able  to  obtain
    confirmation from the  Chief  Administrator  of  the  Coast  Provincial
    General Hospital in Mombasa that  Mr  Ben  Shapaye  works  there  as  a
    Registered Clinical Officer who is allowed to carry out limited medical
    procedures.  The letter attaches a copy of  that  confirmation  of  the
    Chief Administrator by way of a printout as it was received by e-mail.

 7. The attachment is a letter dated 8 December 2014 from Coast  Provincial
    General Hospital, signed by the Chief Administrator.  This states  that
    Mr Ben Shapaye is a Registered Clinical Officer working in the Accident
    and Emergency Department:  "Clinical Officers are legally allowed to do
    limited medical practice and perform certain specified  minor  surgical
    procedures.  They are NOT allowed to use the title "Doctor" and are not
    allowed to write medical reports."

 8. The sponsor said that this confirmed that Mr Ben Shapaye did exist  and
    did  work  in  the  hospital.   He  had  been  unable  to  obtain  such
    confirmation earlier because the previous Chief Administrator had  been
    sacked and he had to wait until another took  over.   In  the  document
    relied upon in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the  author  styled  himself
    "Doctor Ben", but it should be taken  into  account  that  the  use  of
    language and of formal titles are not as strictly observed in a country
    such as Kenya.  Individuals might refer to or call themselves "Doctors"
    even if not fully or  formally  qualified.   The  original  letter  was
    obtained by the sponsor through his sister.  He insisted that    it was
    genuine, and that the judge went wrong in finding it to be  false.   He
    wished his daughter to come to the UK, which would  be  a  much  better
    place for her.

 9. In response Mrs O'Brien said that  the  letter  now  tendered  was  not
    admissible to show error of law in the First-tier Tribunal, and in  any
    event it did not add significantly to the information which was  before
    that Tribunal, which was entitled to conclude as it did.

10. I reserved my determination.

11. I make  all  possible  allowance  for  the  poor  presentation  of  the
    appellant's case in the First-tier Tribunal and for the lack  of  legal
    representation in the Upper Tribunal.

12. The first ground of appeal is  that  the  judge  failed  to  apply  the
    correct standard of proof, which was above the balance of probability.

13. The grounds cite J v SSHD [2012] SLT 162, where the Inner House  relied
    on authorities predating Re B (Children), in particular on RP (Proof of
    forgery) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 86.  The Court does not  appear  to  have
    been referred to Re B (Children), and gave no consideration to  whether
    a Tribunal should apply a different standard when sitting in  Scotland.
    Since Re B (Children) a Tribunal sitting in England  and  Wales  should
    direct itself that there is only one civil standard of proof  and  that
    is the balance of probability (Lord Hoffman at paragraph  13,  Baroness
    Hale of Richmond at paragraph 70).  It would be impossible for decision
    makers and especially for ECO's  to  vary  the  standard  according  to
    whether any appeal against their decision might eventually come  before
    a Tribunal sitting north or south of the border.

14. Whether the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber),  a
    United Kingdom Tribunal,  when  sitting  in  Scotland  should  apply  a
    different standard of proof is a question upon which I am reluctant  to
    opine without fully developed submissions.  However, I tend to the view
    that the standard of proof does not vary by where that  Tribunal  sits.
    In the present case there is a significant further consideration.  I do
    not think the judge can be said to have  gone  wrong  when  he  applied
    exactly the standard of proof which the appellant invited him to apply,
    and which may well be the correct standard.

15. The second ground of appeal criticises the adverse credibility  finding
    regarding the sponsor.  Paragraph 10 of the grounds says that  the  FTT
    gave no reasons.

16. Difficulties the judge had with the oral and documentary  evidence  run
    together.  It is conceivable that another judge might  have  found  the
    sponsor to be a more reliable witness,  and  even  that  another  judge
    might have found the document to be genuine in  spite  of  its  obvious
    shortcomings, bearing in mind the different standards to be expected in
    a  third  world  country.   However,  it  cannot  be  said   that   the
    determination does not give reasons.  At paragraph 41 the  judge  notes
    that the appellant and sponsor sat back  regarding  the  issue  of  the
    challenged document of which they were on notice.  He  found  that  the
    sponsor's  explanations  were  unconvincing  and   contradicted   those
    resulting from enquiries made by the High Commission.   The  judge  had
    the advantage of hearing the sponsor's  evidence  and  found  him  "too
    quick to answer a question with another  question,  or  to  ignore  the
    question put, and to seek to answer a question not put".   The  judge's
    conclusions, based on the oral as well  as  the  documentary  evidence,
    should not be lightly interfered with.   I  find  that  the  conclusion
    reached was open to the judge, that intelligible reasons are given, and
    that they are legally adequate to explain  to  the  appellant  why  the
    evidence was found to fall short on the balance of probability.

17. The third ground is that paragraph  320(7A)  of  the  Rules  is  itself
    unfair.  As Counsel for the appellant acknowledged at  the  stage  when
    she had the advantage of representation this sets a very  high  target,
    aiming to show that the Secretary of State has gone beyond  her  powers
    by creating a Rule  which  is  contrary  to  fairness  and  to  natural
    justice.  I am unable on the basis of this undeveloped ground of appeal
    to arrive at such a far-reaching finding.

18. As to Article 8, the judge may have gone too far by finding that family
    life did not exist.  However, for the reasons given by  the  Presenting
    Officer the outcome based on proportionality outwith the Rules was  not
    at all likely have been any different.  The decision does not interfere
    with such limited family life as there has been almost  throughout  the
    appellant's childhood, up to the date of  the  adverse  decision,  made
    shortly before she became an adult.  If the appellant  were  to  remove
    from Kenya to the UK she would be leaving her mother and  older  sister
    with whom she has spent all her life to live with the sponsor whom  she
    has seen only for short periods at  intervals  of  several  years.   It
    could not realistically be said that the outcome is a  disproportionate
    interference with the family life interests of either the appellant  or
    the sponsor.

19. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.  No anonymity
    direction has been requested or made.
