                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State for the Home Department
       against the decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Eldridge
       promulgated in a determination dated the 19th July 2019 when the
       appeal of Mr Jan Gajdos was allowed. For ease of reference we shall
       refer to the parties under the nomenclature that was used in relation
       to them before the First Tier Tribunal. The facts of this appeal are
       as follows.

    2. The Appellant is a national of Slovakia who came to the UK in 1990.
       On the 14th July 2016 he was convicted on his own plea of permitting
       the production of cannabis and sentenced to 18th months imprisonment.
       Prior to this offence in 2006 the Appellant was convicted of an
       offence of drink driving and in 2007 of driving whist disqualified
       and uninsured. The facts of the 2016 offence were described by the
       sentencing judge, Mr Recorder Taylor, as a case involving 3.4kg of
       cannabis with a street value of �34,000. The Judge noted that the
       premises concerned were a public house and that the motivation for
       the offence was financial gain. This offence caused the Respondent to
       notify the Appellant on the 27th March 2017 that he was to be
       deported. The Appellant appealed that decision and his appeal was
       dismissed on the 21st June 2018. That appeal decision was set aside
       by the Upper Tribunal on the 13th March 2019 and the matter was
       remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a full hearing.

    3. The Appellant did not attend that hearing which occurred on the 12th
       July 2019. At the hearing the First-tier Tribunal Judge had to
       consider issues raised under the Immigration (European Economic Area)
       Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations") and human rights. The first
       question which the judge had to resolve was the standard to be
       applied to the Appellant in order to determine whether or not he
       should be deported. As the First-tier Tribunal Judge noted, the
       effect of regulations 23 and 27 of the EEA Regulations is that an EEA
       national in the UK may only be removed on the basis of public policy,
       public security or public health; if the EEA national has acquired a
       right of permanent residence then a higher standard is set, and the
       person can only be removed on the basis of "serious grounds" of
       public policy, public security or public health. Public health
       considerations did not arise in the present case.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge turned firstly to consider whether or
       not under regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations the Appellant had
       demonstrated that he had resided in the UK in accordance with the
       regulations for a continuous period of 5 years. The First-tier
       Tribunal judge noted that "there is a variety of documentary evidence
       and no oral evidence available", but nonetheless he went on to
       consider such evidence as was available in order to determine whether
       or not the Appellant had been a job seeker, worker, self employed
       person, self-sufficient person or student during a qualifying five
       year period. His conclusions in that regard were expressed as
       follows:

           "27.  As I have mentioned already, the appellant has sought and
           obtained a document from HMRC. This is under cover of a letter
           from them that is dated 13 October 2017. It is unfortunate that
           the records produced with it seem only to have been copied on
           every other page and that there are also some further omissions.
           To explain this further, pages 1, 2 and 3 are all present but
           then only the odd numbers are attached up until page 29 where
           there is a more substantial gap until pages 37, 38, 39 and 40
           are provided.

           28.   The records available demonstrate the appellant was
           working in the tax years 2010/11 until 2016/17. Those are six
           separate tax years and, accordingly, cover more than the five
           year period as required under the Regulations. The documents
           demonstrate earnings in each tax year of at least approximately
           �20,833, �21,055, �12,842, �1463 and �23,937. The year of the
           low income of a little under �1500 was 2015/16. Some of these
           tax years may have had higher income because of the omission of
           records for part of the relevant years. Unfortunately, from the
           point of view of the appellant, the gap between page 29 and page
           37 appears to coincide with the 2015/16 tax year.

           29.   This is not an appeal in which documents are required as a
           matter of law but rather the evidence must be assessed in the
           round. Viewed on the basis the appellant appears to have been in
           frequent and regular work and only in receipt of jobseekers
           allowance for a period in 2011 and part of 2015. It is not
           possible to see when the payment of that allowance ceased in
           that tax year. Nevertheless, the records do not show consistent
           resource to public benefit (not that that is relevant if the
           appellant is genuinely job-seeking) and, taking a view of the
           evidence as a whole, including the comments of the sentencing
           judge concerning the appellant's hard work in the community, I
           am satisfied to the required standard, which is that of the
           balance of probabilities, that he was a worker (and occasionally
           a jobseeker) between 2010 and 2016 and, thus, by the end of the
           tax year 2016/17 he had acquired as a matter of law a right of
           permanent residence."

    5. On the basis of these conclusions the First-tier Tribunal judge was
       satisfied that the Appellant had established a right of permanent
       residence. He was not satisfied that ten years continuous residence
       in accordance with the EEA Regulations had been established such that
       removal could only arise on the basis of "imperative" grounds. The
       First-tier Tribunal judge went on to consider, against the factors
       set out in regulation 27(5) of the EEA Regulations, whether or not
       there were serious grounds of public policy or public security which
       warranted the Appellant's removal from the UK. He expressed his
       conclusions in that respect as follows:

           "34.  One of the six factors set out above is particularly
           relevant here, in my judgment, because it relates to whether or
           not there is "a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
           threat" to the fundamental interest of society and it is
           relevant to take into account the appellant's past conduct. It
           is pertinent that the sentencing judge remarked upon the
           appellant's essentially good character and the lack of any
           previous convictions - as a man in his 40s - for a drug related
           offence.

           ...

           36.   I find it relevant that this appellant has been able to
           demonstrate his residence in this country and a good working
           record from 2010 until his removal following the making of the
           deportation order. I disagree with the proposition of the
           respondent that he had not integrated into life in this country.
           This appears to be based upon mainly the conviction that
           triggered deportation but that factor has to be set alongside
           the sentencing remarks of the learned Recorder and his reference
           in particular to the otherwise good character of the appellant
           and his unreserved acceptance that the appellant had done
           excellent work in his community and this was voluntary work
           which was "very much to his credit". As I have said that credit
           reflected itself in a somewhat lesser sentence than might have
           been in the case.

           37.   I also consider it to be a relevant consideration that the
           appellant had no previous convictions in relation to drugs,
           whether in terms of simple possession or supply or cultivation.
           Cannabis is not a class A drug and that also is a relevant
           factor but, nonetheless, the amount involved was considerable
           and the sentencing judge plainly considered there was no
           alternative but to impose an immediate custodial sentence of
           some length. In the circumstances of this appellant, I do not
           consider that it can be established that he continues to present
           a threat to one of the fundamental interests of society. He is
           entitled to have his record taken into account and, so far as
           that record is concerned, this was a serious but one-off
           offence.

           38.   It is also relevant, that the appellant is a man of mature
           years, now being 45, and he has shown a good work record and,
           thus, a degree of financial independence. In this context I do
           not ignore the sentencing remarks and the reference to money
           being a consideration in the offence but that needs to be pit
           within the context of a sustained work record.

           39.   In all the circumstances I do not find that the decision
           taken was a proportionate one or that the appellant presents a
           sufficiently serious present threat to public policy or public
           security. His appeal will be allowed on that basis.

    6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge went on to conclude that the
       Appellant's Article 8 claim had to fail but, for the reasons set out,
       the appeal should be allowed.

    7. On behalf of the Respondent, Mr Lindsay submits that there are
       fundamental problems with the conclusions reached in relation to
       whether or not the Appellant had established a right of permanent
       residence under regulation 15 of the EEA Regulations. He submits that
       the First-tier Tribunal judge impermissibly afforded the Appellant
       the benefit of the doubt created by his failure to produce
       comprehensive evidence and effectively fill the gaps in that evidence
       so as to reach the conclusion that the Appellant had established that
       he had been present for a continuous period of five years in
       accordance with the EEA Regulations. The evidence which is recorded
       in paragraphs 27-29 is simply not capable of establishing that fact.
       Furthermore, the figure recorded for the tax year 2015/16 of �1,463
       is simply incapable of supporting the contention that the Appellant
       was working during that year. As a consequence, the conclusion the
       judge reached that the case was proved in relation to the right of
       permanent residence was simply unsustainable.

    8. We accept the force of Mr Lindsay's submissions in relation to the
       judge's factual conclusions. The evidence was far from complete and
       was unexplained by any oral evidence from the Appellant. In order to
       satisfy the requirements of regulation 15 it was incumbent upon the
       Appellant to produce satisfactory evidence which demonstrated that he
       was living in the UK for a period of 5 years in accordance with the
       regulations. The evidence which the First-tier Tribunal Judge
       recorded was simply incapable of sustaining that conclusion. The
       amount recorded as the earnings of the Appellant in the tax year
       2015/16 is wholly inconsistent with the Judge's assertion that the
       evidence demonstrated he was "in frequent and regular work". There
       was incomplete evidence in relation to the periods for which he had
       been claiming job seekers allowance and this was incapable of
       sustaining a conclusion that supported his case. In all the
       circumstances the evidence recorded by the Judge was not properly
       capable of supporting a conclusion that a right of permanent
       residence had been proved. In the circumstances we accept that this
       is a clear error of law in the Judge's decision and his conclusion
       that the appeal should be allowed must be set aside.

    9. In the event that we were satisfied that an error of law had been
       made out Mr Lindsay submitted that the decision should be remade by
       the Upper Tribunal. That is a submission to which we accede and we
       now proceed to remake the decision.

   10. It follows from our earlier conclusions that the evidence available
       in the present case is simply incapable of establishing that the
       requirements of regulation 15 have been satisfied. The Appellant's
       case therefore falls to be resolved on the basis of whether or not
       pursuant to regulation 27 the Appellant should be removed on the
       basis of public policy and public security. Bearing in mind the
       principles set out in regulation 27(5) of the EEA Regulations our
       conclusions are as follows.

   11. It is clear from the matters set out above that the conviction which
       triggered the Respondent's decision to deport the Appellant related
       to a serious offence of production of class B drugs involving a
       significant amount of drugs being produced. Whilst it is right to
       observe that in his sentencing remarks the Judge observed that the
       Appellant had been involved in excellent work in the community, the
       offence for which he was sentenced to a significant prison sentence
       was one which involved a very substantial amount of cannabis. Bearing
       in mind the seriousness of the offence and the significance of the
       scale in which the Appellant was involved in the cultivation of drugs
       in our view the decision which the Respondent reached was once which
       was entirely proportionate. In our view the Respondent was correct to
       observe in the decision letter in this case that the Appellant posed
       a real risk of serious harm to the public. The cultivation of drugs
       at scale (here 3.4kgs of cannabis with a street value of �34,000) and
       the subsequent dealing in drugs which it facilitates has seriously
       harmful impacts on society and leads to other offending related to
       drug use and addiction. The conclusion of the Respondent that the
       Appellant was not fully integrated into society as a result of his
       offending behaviour was a legitimate finding bearing in mind the most
       recent offence and the Appellant's criminal past set out above. The
       prospects of rehabilitation in the Appellant's case would not be
       prejudiced by his return to Slovakia: as the Respondent observed
       there was no evidence to suggest that the Appellant could not work
       towards his rehabilitation there and thus no need for him to remain
       in the UK to do so. The decision to deport the Appellant was in all
       of these circumstances entirely proportionate.

   12. We accept the findings of the First-tier Tribunal Judge, which are
       not an issue, that the Appellant's claims in relation to Article 8
       must fail. In circumstances, therefore, where the Appellant has not
       established his right to a permanent residence we are satisfied that
       the Respondent's decision was entirely appropriate and the appeal
       decision in this case must be remade by dismissing it.



DECISION

   13. The Respondent's appeal is allowed and the decision is re-made
       dismissing the Appellant's appeal.
