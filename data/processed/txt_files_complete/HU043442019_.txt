                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  E
    Grant ("the judge"), promulgated on 22 November 2019. By that decision,
    the judge dismissed the appellant's  appeal  against  the  respondent's
    decision, dated 7 February 2019, refusing her human rights claim,  made
    by way of an application for entry clearance as the child of a refugee,
    pursuant to paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules ("the Rules").

 2. The appellant, a citizen of Zimbabwe, was born in March  2001.  She  is
    the daughter of Mr Mabiza ("the sponsor"), who had come to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2002, initially as a student. He subsequently claimed asylum
    and was granted refugee status in 2010. The  appellant's  human  rights
    claim was made on 19 October 2018.

 3. The date of the sponsor's departure from Zimbabwe meant  that  he  left
    when the appellant was only a  baby.  Whilst  still  in  Zimbabwe,  the
    sponsor had not lived with the appellant and her  mother.  In  refusing
    the human rights claim, the respondent concluded that the appellant had
    not been part of the  sponsor's  family  unit  prior  to  the  latter's
    departure from the country. Therefore, sub-paragraph (iv) of  paragraph
    352D of the Rules was not  satisfied.  Article  8  was  not  given  any
    additional consideration.

Relevant law

 4. Although of course this has always been, and remains,  a  human  rights
    only appeal, paragraph 352D of the Rules plays a very significant part.
    That provides as follows:

         352D. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom in order to join or remain with the
         parent who currently has refugee status are that the applicant:

             (i) is the child of a parent who currently has refugee status
             granted under the Immigration Rules in the United Kingdom; and

             (ii)      is under the age of 18; and

             (iii)     is not leading an independent life, is unmarried and
             is not a civil partner, and has not formed an independent
             family unit; and

             (iv)      was part of the family unit of the person granted
             asylum at the time that the person granted asylum left the
             country of their habitual residence in order to seek asylum;
             and

             (v) the applicant would not be excluded from protection by
             virtue of paragraph 334(iii) or (iv) of these Rules or Article
             1F of the Refugee Convention if they were to seek asylum in
             their own right; and

             (vi)      if seeking leave to enter, holds a valid United
             Kingdom entry clearance for entry in this capacity.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The respondent was  not  represented  at  the  hearing.  Her  case  was
    therefore as stated in the reasons for refusal letter.

 6. DNA evidence provided by the appellant proved that she was the daughter
    of the sponsor:  [15]-[16].  The  judge  found  that  the  sponsor  had
    separated from the appellant's mother  soon  after  the  appellant  was
    born. She also found that the sponsor had been "closely  involved  with
    the appellant's care and upbringing prior  to  his  departure  for  the
    United Kingdom and has remained closely involved in her life...": [18].
    At [19], the judge concluded that the appellant was  not  part  of  the
    sponsor's family unit prior to the latter's departure from Zimbabwe. As
    a result, sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph 352D not satisfied.

 7. The judge went on at  [19]  to  consider  what  she  described  as  the
    "remaining issue" under paragraph 352D. On the basis of the reasons for
    refusal letter and in the absence of a Presenting Officer, there  would
    not have been any such issue. However, it appears as though  the  judge
    raised another issue of her  own  volition  and  that  the  appellant's
    Counsel was asked for submissions. The issue in  question  was  whether
    the sponsor had left Zimbabwe "in order  to  seek  asylum"  within  the
    meaning of sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph 352D.

 8. The judge found that because the sponsor had come to the United Kingdom
    as a student and only claimed asylum some years later, he had not  left
    Zimbabwe "in order  to  seek  asylum"  and  therefore  this  aspect  of
    paragraph 352D could not be satisfied: [20]-[22]. In so concluding, the
    judge relied on the decision of the Upper Tribunal  in  MS  and  Others
    (family reunion: "in order to seek asylum") Somalia [2009] UKAIT 00041.

 9. No other issues in respect of the Rules arose.

10. Article 8 was considered on a wider basis and the judge concluded  that
    the respondent's decision was, particularly in light of  the  inability
    to satisfy paragraph 352D, proportionate.

The grounds of appeal and grant of permission

11. The grounds can be condensed into the following core assertions. First,
    it was said that the  judge  was  wrong  to  have  concluded  that  the
    appellant was not part of  the  sponsor's  family  unit  prior  to  his
    departure from Zimbabwe  in  2002.  Second,  the  judge  erred  in  her
    application of MS.

12. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Osborne
    on 6 May 2020.

The hearing

13. The remotely-conducted hearing was  listed  for  12pm.  The  notice  of
    hearing had been sent out 14 May 2021. That notice specifically  stated
    that the parties should ensure that they joined the hearing  "at  least
    30 minutes before the scheduled time." There is a good reason for  this
    stipulation: if there are any technical difficulties with one or  other
    party joining the hearing, these can be addressed  (in  so  far  as  is
    possible) during the 30-minute period prior to the commencement of  the
    hearing.

14. Ms Jaja, Counsel, was  due  to  appear  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.
    However, she was not, for reasons unknown, able to  join  the  hearing.
    Although it appeared as though she had entered as  a  "participant"  at
    one stage, she could neither be seen nor heard. I am satisfied that she
    did not attempt to join the hearing 30 minutes before its commencement,
    as stated in the notice of hearing. It appears as though  she  only  in
    fact sought to join very close indeed to the commencement time  itself.
    Thereafter, I am satisfied that any technical difficulties she may have
    experienced were not as a result of anything on the Tribunal's side  of
    the equation. Ms Everett had no difficulties and a member of the public
    observing the hearing was also able to see  and  hear  proceedings  and
    could be seen and heard by the Tribunal.

15. I allowed for a 20-minute delay to the commencement of the  hearing  in
    order for Ms Jaja to address whatever technical problems she seemed  to
    have been experiencing. I was not prepared to  delay  the  hearing  any
    longer. The appellant has been waiting for an extremely long  time  for
    her appeal to be considered. The Tribunal's clerks had  endeavoured  to
    do whatever they could to assist Ms Jaja and I was not  prepared  asked
    them to do anything more. Adjourning the  case  purely  because  of  Ms
    Jaja's  inability  to  sort  out  her  own   technical   problems   out
    (particularly when she  had  not  joined  the  hearing  30  minutes  in
    advance, when such difficulties could perhaps  have  been  dealt  with)
    would have been contrary to the overriding objective and the  interests
    of justice.

16. Combined with the circumstances set out above was the position  adopted
    by Ms Everett in this case, to  which  I  will  refer  shortly.  I  was
    satisfied that I could and should proceed with the hearing in Ms Jaja's
    absence.

17. Ms Everett, in her customary considered and realistic manner,  accepted
    that the judge had materially erred in law when  considering  paragraph
    352D of the Rules. On the "family unit" issue, the judge had failed  to
    direct herself to the case of BM and AL (352D(iv); meaning  of  "family
    unit") Colombia [2007] UKAIT 00055. The fact that the sponsor  had  not
    been living with the appellant and her  mother  at  the  time  he  left
    Zimbabwe was not determinative, contrary to what the judge appeared  to
    have found. On the question of whether the sponsor  left  Zimbabwe  "in
    order  to  seek  asylum",  Ms  Everett  accepted  that  the  judge  had
    misapplied MS. That case concerned the scenario in  which  the  sponsor
    had themselves come to the United Kingdom on a  family  reunion  basis.
    That was not the situation in the present case, where the  sponsor  had
    originally entered as a student, but then successfully  claimed  asylum
    in his own right. As such, MS did not preclude the satisfaction of sub-
    paragraph (iv).

18. Ms Everett went on to accept that once the  judge's  decision  was  set
    aside, the decision in this case should be re-made at this stage  based
    on the evidence on file and the judge's findings of fact (as opposed to
    her conclusions based thereon). Ms Everett accepted that the  appellant
    had been part of  the  sponsor's  family  unit  when  the  latter  left
    Zimbabwe. She accepted that the sponsor had left Zimbabwe in  order  to
    claim asylum (albeit this occurred sometime after his  arrival  in  the
    United Kingdom). She accepted that there was clearly continuing  family
    life between the appellant and the sponsor. In response to an  issue  I
    raised at the hearing, she also acknowledged that  the  fact  that  the
    sponsor now had indefinite leave to remain was not  a  barrier  to  the
    satisfaction of paragraph  352D,  in  light  of  the  respondent's  own
    guidance on family reunion.

19. Ultimately, Ms Everett conceded that the appeal should  be  allowed  on
    Article 8 grounds.



Conclusions on error of law

20. In my judgment, Ms Everett was entirely right to concede that the judge
    had materially erred in law.

21. The case of BM and AL makes it clear that question of what is a "family
    unit" for the purposes of paragraph 352D(iv) of the Rules is a question
    of fact. That the sponsor had not being living in the same household as
    the appellant prior to the  former's  departure  from  the  country  of
    origin is not determinative.

22. The judge's conclusion on this issue, as set  out  at  [18]  and  [19],
    effectively treated the absence of cohabitation as determinative.  That
    was a misdirection in law. It was a material  misdirection  because  at
    the same time she found as a fact that notwithstanding  the  separation
    of the sponsor from the appellant's mother, he  was  "closely  involved
    with the appellant's care and upbringing prior to his departure for the
    United Kingdom." This factual basis would have formed  a  strong  basis
    for a conclusion that the appellant had  been  part  of  the  sponsor's
    family unit prior to his departure.

23. On the second issue (and assuming that it was properly raised with  the
    appellant's representative at the hearing), the judge's reliance on  MS
    was misplaced. That case does not decide the point that she was seeking
    to make at [20]-[22]. MS precludes the ability of  a  sponsor  who  was
    themself the beneficiary of family reunion from  being  an  appropriate
    sponsor under paragraph 352D(iv) of the Rules. It does not  extend  any
    wider than that. Although  the  judge  regarded  the  wording  of  sub-
    paragraph (iv) to be clear, thus precluding the sponsor's  eligibility,
    there is no support for this proposition to be found in the case-law or
    the respondent's Family Reunion guidance (version 5.0, published on  31
    December 2020). Further, Ms Everett has made the respondent's  position
    clear in this particular case.

24. I am satisfied that sub-paragraph  (iv)  of  paragraph  352D  does  not
    include, expressly or by implication, a  temporal  requirement  that  a
    sponsor must, at the point of  their  departure  from  the  country  of
    origin, have had an intention to seek asylum upon arrival in  the  host
    country. Aside from the lack of any  support  for  this  from  external
    sources, such a requirement would  preclude  a  significant  number  of
    refugees from being family reunion sponsors; for example, all those who
    became refugees sur place. I find it highly unlikely that this was  the
    respondent's intention the Rule. Therefore, I conclude that the judge's
    error in approach is not "cured" by any underlying  correctness  as  to
    the meaning of the sub-paragraph.

25. I briefly address an  issue  that  I  raised  during  the  hearing  and
    mentioned earlier in this decision. On the  sponsor's  evidence  (which
    appears to have been accepted  by  the  judge),  he  had  been  granted
    indefinite leave to remain in 2015 and that  the  respondent's  reasons
    for refusal letter was wrong to have stated that he  only  had  limited
    leave: [6] and [36]. On the basis that he did have indefinite leave  to
    remain at all material times, I had  considered  whether  sub-paragraph
    (i) could have been satisfied. However, having regard to what  is  said
    at page 14 of the respondent's guidance on Family Reunion (cited above)
    and in light of Ms  Everett's  clear  position,  I  conclude  that  the
    sponsor's status did not preclude satisfaction of that criterion.

26. Having regard to the foregoing, I exercise my discretion and set  aside
    the judge's decision.

Re-make decision

27. There is a presumption that the Upper Tribunal will go on and re-make a
    decision once that of the First-tier Tribunal has been  set  aside.  In
    the present case I have very  carefully  considered  whether  this  was
    appropriate, given the absence of Ms Jaja from the hearing.

28. In light of the narrow issues  involved,  Ms  Everett's  position,  the
    factual  findings  made  by  the  judge,  and  the  significant   delay
    experienced by the appellant thus far, I concluded that I should indeed
    re-make  the  decision  based  on  the  relevant  legal  framework  and
    materials on file.

29. I make the following findings of fact,  based  in  the  main  on  those
    stated by the judge:

          a) the appellant is the daughter of the sponsor;

          b) the sponsor initially came to the United Kingdom as a student.
             He claimed asylum 2008;

          c) the sponsor was granted refugee status under the Rules in 2010
             and was then granted indefinite leave to remain  in  2015.  He
             has not yet become a British citizen;

          d) although the sponsor separated  from  the  appellant's  mother
             soon after the appellant's birth, he played a significant role
             in the life of the latter prior to his departure from Zimbabwe
             in 2002;

          e) the sponsor has remained closely involved in  the  appellant's
             life at all times thereafter;

          f) the sponsor is a qualified mental health nurse.

30. I conclude that on the facts of this case, the appellant  was  part  of
    the sponsor's "family unit" prior to the latter leaving Zimbabwe  2002,
    despite the absence of cohabitation. In this regard, I direct myself to
    what is said in BM and AL.

31. I conclude that the sponsor  did  leave  Zimbabwe  "in  order  to  seek
    asylum", having regard to what I have already said in paragraphs 23 and
    24, above.

32. I conclude that the sponsor is eligible as  such,  notwithstanding  the
    fact that he has indefinite leave to remain.

33. Whilst the appellant is now over 18 years old, the human  rights  claim
    (entry clearance application) was made when she was still a minor.

34. All of the requirements of paragraph 352D of the Rules are satisfied.

35. It is quite clear that there has been, and is, family life between  the
    appellant and the sponsor.

36. Following TZ (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, and in the absence of any
    countervailing factors, I conclude that the satisfaction  of  paragraph
    352D is, in all the circumstances, determinative of  this  appeal.  The
    appellant's Article 8 rights outweigh  the  important  public  interest
    considerations under section 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, as amended, and her appeal  falls  to  be  allowed  on
    human rights grounds.

Anonymity

37. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction and nor  do
    I.



Notice of Decision

38. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

39. I exercise my discretion  under  section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals,
    Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 and set aside the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal.

40. I re-make the decision by allowing the appeal on Article 8 grounds.
