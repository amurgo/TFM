Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M Matthews, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Mr E MacKay, of McGlashan MacKay, Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The parties are as described above,  but  the  rest  of  this  decision
    refers to them as they were in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD refused the protection  claim  of  R  S  by  letter  dated  13
    December 2016, principally because even taking the claim "at  highest",
    (a) the Albanian authorities offered legal sufficiency  of  protection,
    and (b) the appellant could relocate within Albania.

 3. FtT Judge Blair heard her appeal on 14 March 2017.  The  SSHD  was  not
    represented.  In his decision, promulgated on 5 April 2017, he did  not
    accept the submission that her history  was  one  of  trafficking,  but
    found that she  was  traumatised;  she  had  no  support  or  treatment
    available in Albania; if she approached  the  authorities,  she  "might
    well  face  further  rejection"  (�43);  and  it   would   be   "wholly
    impracticable to expect her to relocate" (�47).  At �50, the judge said
    that  the  SSHD's  policy  entitled  the  appellant   to   humanitarian
    protection, and that on the same facts the appeal also succeeded  under
    article 3 of the ECHR.

 4. The main points of the SSHD's grounds of appeal to the UT are these:

           ...

           3.   The judge ... at �49 finds it likely the appellant and  her
           husband came to the UK for economic purposes.  The judge however
           at �50 concludes that the appellant is entitled to  humanitarian
           protection.   It  appears  [this]  stems   from   his   apparent
           conclusion that the appellant is Roma (which was not  explicitly
           accepted in the refusal letter) and suffering from PTSD.

           4.  The judge has not engaged with the  refusal  letter  ...  in
           particular ... there is a complete disregard to  �75  where  the
           very high threshold for  article  3  breach  was  emphasised  by
           reference to N v SSHD [2005] UKHL 31.

           5.  The judge refers to existence of a policy ... the  terms  of
           which are not repeated in the decision ... the author  of  these
           grounds has ... failed to come across a  policy  to  the  effect
           that article 3 rights of an Albanian female  of  Roma  ethnicity
           (even if this appellant was accepted as such) and who  has  PTSD
           (assuming the judge was correct to make this  conclusion  -  see
           �80-83 of the refusal letter) would be  breached  on  return  to
           Albania.

 5. On 22 September 2017, permission was granted by  UT  Judge  Grubb,  who
    observed:

            ....  It is arguable that the judge's  reasons  are  inadequate
           both  in  respect  of  the  appellant  reaching  the  article  3
           threshold and what if any policy of the Home Office is  referred
           to in �27.  It is unclear whether it is the same one referred to
           in �25 and its terms are not cited.  It may be that this  latter
           matter can be resolved before the UT.  For the present, however,
           I have concerns whether the judge's ultimate finding in  respect
           of article 3 and humanitarian protection is sustainable.

 6. The gist of a rule 24 response for the appellant is as follows:

           .... the judge referred at �25 to Home Office policy on  victims
           of domestic violence in Albania. He ... went on at �27  to  note
           the current policy position of the respondent. ... It  is  clear
           from the Home Office policy at  the  conclusion  to  the  policy
           summary at 3.1.1 - 3.1.4 that this was the policy referred to by
           the judge.

           It must  be  considered  that  the  Home  Secretary  would  have
           knowledge of the terms of her own guidance. Where  a  judge  had
           previous referred to a policy document one would think  that  an
           informed reader would ... consider the  policy  summary.  It  is
           clear the judge was referring to  the  April  2016  Home  Office
           guidance on domestic violence in Albania ... Had the  author  of
           the grounds had regard to the papers lodged and relied upon,  it
           should have  been  evident  what  the  "current  policy  of  the
           respondent" referred to was.

           The judge's ultimate findings  ...  must  be  sustained  as  the
           policy states that where women can "demonstrate that there is  a
           reasonable risk of serious harm as a result of domestic violence
           and have no recourse to effective state protection  or  internal
           relocation then they should be granted humanitarian protection".

           The judge accepted the evidence of the appellant in  respect  of
           her being Roma and the Home Secretary had already  accepted  ...
           that she was a victim of domestic violence (being  the  decision
           made in the NTM trafficking decision). There are  no  errors  of
           law shown in respect of the  findings  in  respect  of  fear  of
           domestic violence, no challenge to the findings  in  respect  of
           her being Roma and no challenge to the findings  in  respect  of
           insufficiency of protection. The  Home  Office  guidance  states
           that where there is no recourse to effective state protection or
           internal relocation an appellant should be granted  humanitarian
           protection. There is no basis therefore on which it can be  said
           that the judge's ultimate  finding  on  humanitarian  protection
           should not be sustained.

 7. Mr Matthews accepted  at  the  outset  that  the  judge  did  find  the
    appellant to be Roma, and that there was no challenge to that finding.

 8. It was common  ground  that  the  respondent  has  a  policy,  "Country
    Information and Guidance, Albania: Women  fearing  domestic  violence",
    version 1.0, April 2016, which the appellant placed before the judge.

 9. It was agreed in  course  of  submissions  that  �27  of  the  decision
    contains typographical errors, and should read as  follows,  accurately
    reflecting the policy:

      ... the ... policy position of the respondent is that  women  who  can
      demonstrate that there is a real risk of serious harm as a  result  of
      domestic violence and have no recourse to effective  state  protection
      or internal relocation should be granted humanitarian protection.

10. Mr Matthews submitted further to �4 of the grounds, as follows:

      i) The appeal was allowed on humanitarian and  human  rights  grounds,
         effectively based on article 3 of the ECHR.

     ii) Protection on such grounds, where the risk  arises  from  non-state
         actors, does not involve the tests for internal relocation  applied
         in refugee protection, such as  undue  harshness,  but  requires  a
         finding of real risk throughout the country.

    iii) There was no explicit finding of real risk  anywhere;  but  it  was
         accepted that point was not raised in the grounds, and there was an
         implicit finding.

     iv) Risk had to be established at a very high level: AH (Sudan) v  SSHD
         2007 UKHL 45; N v SSHD; SSHD v Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442.   The  FtT
         did not consider that high threshold.

      v) It was  accepted  that  the  refusal  letter  refers  to  the  high
         threshold only where dealing with the case on medical  grounds  (at
         �75), which the appellant did not advance in the FtT, and not where
         rejecting the case on domestic violence;  but  the  FtT  was  still
         bound to apply the law.

     vi) The judge's findings at �47 were not enough to justify the  outcome
         in terms of the correct threshold.

    vii) The outcome should be reversed.

11. Mr MacKay submitted:

      i) The decision was well reasoned, did not err in law,  and  correctly
         applied the respondent's policy.

     ii) The respondent should have recognised her own policy.   �5  of  the
         grounds was wrong in suggesting there was no applicable policy.

    iii) �5 misrepresented the reasons for which the appeal  succeeded.   It
         was not because the appellant is Albanian,  female,  Roma  and  has
         PTSD.  It was because, on unchallenged findings of fact, the  terms
         of the policy were met: � 25, 27, 43, 47.

     iv) The respondent's submissions about the generally high threshold  to
         be met, throughout the country, were not accepted, but that was  in
         any event irrelevant, as the respondent  had  to  be  kept  to  the
         standard recognised in the policy.

12. Mr Matthews had nothing to add by way of reply.

13. I indicated the outcome, as follows.

14. The respondent is to be taken to know her own policies.

15. The decision at �25 identifies the policy clearly enough.

16. The grounds are wrong about  the  reasons  for  which  the  appeal  was
    allowed.

17. Mr Matthews took a line which was open  on  the  basis  of  �4  of  the
    grounds; but even if the threshold is as high as argued, the  point  is
    answered by the terms of the policy.

18. The grounds hinted faintly at criticism of one of the judge's  findings
    of fact, but that correctly was taken no further.  The  refusal  letter
    does not significantly dispute the appellant's Roma identity.

19. On the judge's undisputed factual findings, all the requirements of the
    respondent's policy were met, and the appeal was bound to succeed.

20. The appeal by the SSHD is dismissed.

21. The decision of the FtT stands.

22. The FtT made an anonymity direction, which remains in place.
