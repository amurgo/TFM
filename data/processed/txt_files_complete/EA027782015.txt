Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Bates (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Park (Legal Representative)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The respondent in these proceedings was  the  appellant  before  the
       First-tier Tribunal. From hereon I have referred to the  parties  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal so that for  example  reference
       to the respondent is a reference to the Secretary of State  for  the
       Home Department.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and he was born on August  2,
       1994. On June 8, 2015 the appellant, along with his mother,  applied
       for a residence card as the family member of an  EEA  national.  The
       respondent refused their applications on November 3, 2015 under  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.

    3. The appellants appealed on November 12, 2015 those  decisions  under
       Regulation 26 of the 2006 Regulations.

    4. The appeals came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Shanahan
       (hereinafter referred to as the Judge) on April 6,  2016  and  in  a
       decision promulgated on May 4, 2016 she allowed their appeals  under
       the 2006 Regulations.

    5. The respondent lodged grounds of appeal on May 13, 2016 against  the
       decision in respect of this appellant submitting the Judge had erred
       by considering the case with reference to the  appellant's  date  of
       birth at the date of decision as against the hearing date.

    6. Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal Murray on October 6, 2016 and the matter  came  before
       me on the above date.

    7. The appellant and his family were in attendance.

    8. No order for anonymity is made.

SUBMISSIONS

    9. Mr Bates  relied  on  the  grounds  of  appeal  and  submitted  that
       following the decision in Boodhoo and another  (EEA  Regs:  relevant
       evidence) [2013] UKUT 00346 (IAC) the Judge should  have  considered
       the case at the date of hearing and not at the date of  application.
       As the appellant was over the age of  twenty-one  the  Judge  should
       have dealt with the matter under Regulation 7(1)(b)(ii) of the  2006
       Regulations as against Regulation 7(1)(b)(i).

   10. Mr Park reminded me that section 85(4) of the 2002  Act  applied  in
       this appeal and that the evidence before the Judge was that  he  had
       attained his status when the application was considered. He referred
       me to paragraph [19] of Boodhoo.

DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   11. This was one of two applications made under  the  2006  Regulations.
       The EEA national accepted  that  he  had  not  submitted  sufficient
       information with his  application  but  blamed  this  on  an  absent
       solicitor. For the appeal hearing the correct paperwork  from  April
       2015 had been submitted to the respondent.

   12. The Judge was satisfied with the quality of the evidence and allowed
       both this appellant's appeal and that of his mother outright. By the
       time the appeal came before the Judge on May 6, 2016  the  appellant
       was almost 21ï¿½ years of age.

   13. Permission to appeal was granted and the issue for  me  to  consider
       was whether the Judge erred in taking the date of application as her
       starting point for the age of the appellant.

   14. There is an important distinction between an application  under  the
       2006 Regulations and one under the Immigration Rules. An EEA  family
       member does not need a piece of paper to enter  or  to  be  admitted
       into this country. All that is required is a valid national identity
       card or  passport  for  the  EEA  national  and  evidence  of  their
       relationship to the EEA national. Similarly,  Regulation  7  of  the
       2006 Regulations makes it clear that a child under the age of twenty-
       one or a dependant of the EEA national shall be treated as a  family
       member. Where an  application  is  refused  the  appeal  rights  are
       governed by Regulation 26(3).

   15. At today's hearing I heard opposing arguments with Mr Bates  arguing
       that as the application was being considered at the date of  hearing
       the Judge had to consider the  application  on  that  day  and  that
       assessment included the fact the appellant was now twenty-one  years
       of age.  Mr  Park  countered  that  argument  stating  that  as  the
       appellant  satisfied  the  Regulations  when  the  application   was
       submitted then the correct date for his age was  when  he  submitted
       his application.

   16. In SGC and Others 2005 UKAIT 00179 the Tribunal said that in an  EEA
       appeal under the 2002 Act the relevant  date  is  the  date  of  the
       hearing. The Judge was required to decide whether  the  respondent's
       decision not to recognise the appellant's EU rights was  correct  at
       the relevant time - whether then or now. The  respondent  holds  the
       executive power to recognise an individual's rights and  the  appeal
       system is there to correct errors made by the respondent.

   17. In Boodhoo and another (EEA Regs:  relevant  evidence)  [2013]  UKUT
       00346 (IAC) it was held that neither section 85A of the Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 nor the guidance  in  DR  (Morocco)*
       [2005] UKAIT 38 regarding a previous version  of  section  85(5)  of
       that Act  has  any  bearing  on  an  appeal  under  the  Immigration
       (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  In  such  an  appeal,  a
       tribunal has power to consider any evidence which it thinks relevant
       to the substance of the decision, including evidence which  concerns
       a matter arising after the date of the decision.

   18. The issue for me to consider is whether the passage of time, and  by
       implication the appellant's passing of 21,  is  a  matter  that  the
       Judge should have had regard to. Mr Park's argument was that his age
       is a fact and not evidence that arose after the date of decision and
       the fact the evidence showed he met the Regulations  before  he  was
       twenty-one meant there was no error in law.

   19. Having considered the submissions and I find that there was an error
       of law on these facts.

   20. When the application was lodged insufficient evidence was  submitted
       to show the EEA national was exercising treaty rights. Rights  under
       the 2006 Regulations are fluid and can end or start at  anytime.  So
       for example, a child who is working and over the age  of  twenty-one
       when the application is submitted is unlikely to  be  dependent  for
       the purposes of the 2006 Regulations but if at the date  of  hearing
       he was no longer working and wholly reliant on the EEA national  for
       his essential needs then he would be dependent on the EEA national.

   21. Turning to the facts of this appeal, whilst the evidence provided in
       this case showed the EEA national was exercising treaty rights  case
       law makes clear that when the matter is subject of  an  appeal  then
       the relevant date for me is the date of hearing. This  includes  the
       fact he was now over the age of twenty-one.

   22. There is therefore an error in law and I set aside the  decision  in
       relation to the appellant. The Judge did not  consider  evidence  of
       dependency and clearly this needs to be done.

   23. Both parties submitted the matter should be returned to  the  First-
       tier tribunal as no findings had been made.

DECISION

   24. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve
       the making of an error on a point of law. I set aside the decision.

   25. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  these
       issues to be addressed hearing under Section 12  of  the  Tribunals,
       Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

   26. The matter should not be  listed  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Shanahan.

   27. I direct that the appellant's solicitors do file and  serve  on  the
       Tribunal and respondent any additional statements and  evidence  not
       less than five days before the hearing of this matter.

   28. If an interpreter is required then the appellant's solicitors should
       advise the Tribunal accordingly.
