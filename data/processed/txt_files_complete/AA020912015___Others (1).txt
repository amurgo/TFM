                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


INSERT ANONYMITY

   1. In a decision promulgated on 5th May 2015, First-tier  Tribunal  judge
      Stott dismissed the appellants' appeals on refugee  and  human  rights
      grounds against the decision dated 16th January 2015  to  remove  them
      from the UK. Permission to appeal that decision was  granted  on  18th
      August 2015.


   2. Before me Mr Diwnycz stated that he concurred  with  Mr  Chelvan  that
      there were material errors of law in the decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal judge as set out in the grounds seeking permission  and  thus
      that the decision should be set aside and remitted to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal to be heard afresh, no findings preserved. I am satisfied  in
      the light of the grounds and the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  that
      this was a correct concession by Mr Diwyncz.


   3. Accordingly, I set aside the decision.

          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the  decision  and  remit  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal for rehearing.

     Consequential Directions


    The matter to be remitted to Birmingham IAC First-tier Tribunal  to  be
    heard by a judge other than Judge Stott.


    A Spanish (South American) interpreter required.


    Time estimate 2 hours.
