Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr S Khan of Counsel on behalf of Malik & Malik
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are Afghan nationals, a mother, son  and  daughter,  all
    of whom seek to appeal against the decision of the respondent dated  21
    July 2017 refusing them residence  cards  under  Regulation  9  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

2.   In essence the immigration decision contends that the  appellants  were
    not genuinely exercising treaty rights in Ireland and that the move  to
    Ireland was simply  a  device  to  secure  immigration  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

3.   The appellants sought to appeal  against  the  decision,  which  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Greasley on 27 July 2018.

4.   Having considered the evidence in some detail as presented, it was  the
    clear finding of the Judge that the purpose of the residence in the EEA
    state was the means of circumventing any immigration laws  applying  to
    non-EEA nationals to which the sponsor would otherwise be subject.

5.   In those circumstances the appeal was dismissed.

6.   Challenge is made to that decision on behalf of the appellant.   It  is
    contended  that  the  Judge  had  failed  to  direct  himself  to   the
    substantial body of case law and of the principles of  Surinder  Singh,
    and had confused in particular  the  requirement  of  genuineness  with
    motivation. Further by failing to recognise that in terms of abuse  the
    burden falls upon the respondent to prove that allegation.

7.   The  relevant  Regulation  is  that  of  Regulation  9,  in  particular
    9(2)(c), (3), (4)(a). It was indicated in  the  decision  of  Oksuzoglu
    (EEA appeal - "new matter") [2018] UKUT 00385 (IAC) and paragraph 22 in
    particular, that Regulation 9 derives its genesis not from the relevant
    directive but from Surinder Singh C-370/90  (1992]  ECR  1-04265.   The
    relevant principles established by Surinder Singh as applied in O and B
    v Minister von Migratie [2014] 3 WLR  799  have  been  transposed  into
    Regulation 9.

8.   Surinder Singh was a case which involved a return  to  the  UK  of  the
    spouse of a British national  who  had  exercised  the  right  of  free
    movement by working and living in Germany,  with  her  husband,  for  a
    period of almost three years.

9.   Generally speaking, therefore, a British sponsor with  family  may  not
    exercise EEA treaty rights in the United  Kingdom  unless  such  rights
    have been exercised by the sponsor  and  family  elsewhere.   In  order
    therefore to preserve the principle of free movement, it has been  held
    that upon return to the United Kingdom such rights may continue  to  be
    exercised.

10.  It is a requirement for such rights to be exercised that the  residence
    in the EEA state was genuine.

11.  Regulations 9(3) provides  as  follows:  factors  relevant  to  whether
    residents in the EEA state is or was genuine include:-

    (a)  whether the centre of BC's life transferred to the EEA state;

    (b)  the length of F and BC's joint residence in the EEA state;

    (c)  the nature and quality of the F and BC's accommodation in the  EEA
         state and whether it is or was BC's principal residence;

    (d)  the degree of F and BC's integration in the EEA state;

    (e)  whether F's first lawful residence in the EU with BC was in an EEA
         state.

12.  Regulation 9(4) provides as follows.  This Regulation does not apply  -



    (a)  where the purpose of the residence in the EEA state was as a means
         for  circumventing  any  immigration  laws  applying   to   non-EEA
         nationals to which F  would  otherwise  be  subject  (such  as  any
         applicable requirement under the 1971 Act  and  to  have  leave  to
         enter or remain in the United Kingdom).

13.  The word "a genuine  one"  has  the  potential  for  causing  confusion
    because it would seem from the generality of the European jurisprudence
    that it should be  interpreted  as  meaning  "real",  "substantive"  or
    "effective".  As such it should not involve the  consideration  of  the
    motives of the persons except in a limited sense of being a  factor  to
    consider whether residence has in fact been established.   As has  been
    submitted in the grounds of appeal, the correct approach to genuineness
    is whether the  sponsor  had  pursued  effective  employment  or  self-
    employment in Ireland or  whether  family  life  had  been  created  or
    fortified there. This must be considered within  the  community  aspect
    the establishment of community contacts rather than simply finding work
    and establishing the family in the home.

14.  In the case of Swaddling [1999] EUECJ  C-90/97  at  paragraph  100  the
    court held that the definition of residence in Article 1(h)  Regulation
    No.1408/71 meant "habitual residence" and suggested it therefore had an
    EU wide meaning.  The court interpreted the phrase that "the membership
    state in which they reside" as being  the  place  "where  the  habitual
    sense of the interest is to  be  found".   This  should  be  determined
    taking into  account  "the  employed  person's  family  situation;  the
    reasons which have led him to move; the length and  continuity  of  his
    residence;  the  fact  (where  it  is  the  case)  that  is  in  stable
    employment;  and  his  intentions  as   it   appears   from   all   the
    circumstances."  In so  saying,  the  court  indicated  that  a  proper
    understanding of whether a person is resident or not must be based, not
    on a single factor, but on  a  collection  of  elements  that  together
    enable the individual situation  to  be  assessed  and  categorised  as
    residents or non-residents.  Such was summarised in the refusal  letter
    of 21st July 2017, with the contention was that the appellants had  not
    demonstrated that the centre of  a  British  citizen's  life  had  been
    transferred to Ireland.

15.  The sponsor moved  to  Ireland  in  June  2015.   In  August  2015  the
    appellants arrived on a visa valid until  September  2015.   The  first
    appellant fell pregnant in October of that year  and  they  then  moved
    back to the United Kingdom in September 2016.   The passports  did  not
    show any entry clearance stamps.

16.  The sponsor gave the reason for moving to Ireland as being  to  develop
    a potential business with Asian Arabic foods.  The Judge  at  paragraph
    38 noted a significant inconsistency in the  evidence  concerning  that
    matter.  In evidence the Sponsor  stated  that  the  enterprise  failed
    because he was unable to give the work commitment required but  in  the
    witness statement he said that the business did not go through  because
    of disagreement regarding terms and conditions.  The Judge  found  that
    the business venture never in reality started.

17.  In paragraph 39 of the determination  the  Judge  effectively  did  not
    accept the credibility of that  explanation.   It  is  found  that  the
    evidence that had been presented on that matter was  based  upon  false
    claims and intentions to deceive and mislead the respondent.

18.  It was accepted that the sponsor did in fact  undertake  some  work  in
    Ireland being work  for  Ennis  Top  Pizza  on  a  short  term  working
    contract.

19.  The Judge noted in paragraph 10 of the determination that although  the
    appellants claimed to have resided in Ireland  with  the  sponsor  from
    August 2015 to September  2016  the  only  evidence  that  the  sponsor
    exercised treaty rights when in Ireland was  for  a  two  month  period
    between January and February 2016 when employed in  Ennis  Top.   There
    was no evidence of the exercise of treaty rights prior to that  and  no
    evidence of any exercise of treaty rights  in  terms  of  working  from
    February 2016 to September 2016.

20.  Although the sponsor claimed that he worked for  Ennis  Top  Pizza  for
    six months the only pay slips that were provided as noted by the  Judge
    were for January, February.  The Judge noted at  paragraph  24  of  the
    determination that the appeal bundle contained a cessation  certificate
    in relation to the first start and finish at Ennis Top Pizza and  terms
    and conditions in relation to that outlet together  with  payslips  for
    the month of January and February 2016.  The Judge also found there  to
    be inconsistent evidence in relation to the circumstances of the  first
    assured shorthold tenancy.  The first appellant had stated that it  was
    only for a limited six month period as this  was  only  a  two  bedroom
    property which was not sufficiently large enough for the  family  as  a
    whole.  As the Judge noted, that failed to explain why a second assured
    shorthold tenancy was signed for a fixed period but at the same address
    and clearly had the same  limited  sized  accommodation.   The  sponsor
    stated in his oral evidence that the reason the first tenancy agreement
    was signed for a maximum of six months was simply because that was  the
    maximum period available at the time and that the property was  up  for
    sale.  The Judge did not find that that  had  been  truthful  nor  that
    credible evidence supplied in relation to those matters.

21.   It  is  accepted  that  the  appellants  and  sponsor  may  have  been
    registered with a doctor in Ireland and two of the children enrolled in
    school that would have been a requirement in any event.  Other than the
    above the Judge found little evidence of integration  in  Ireland.  The
    essential issue being whether in reality the centre of  life  had  been
    transferred to Ireland.

22.  Mr Khan invites my attention to the decision of O and B, in  particular
    to paragraph 51 thereof.  He submits that the residence  of  the  Union
    citizen had been sufficiently genuine so as to enable that  citizen  to
    create or strengthen family life in the member  state.   He  emphasised
    the fact that the appellants were able to join the sponsor and  conduct
    a family life for nearly a year. Thus the strengthening of family  life
    in those circumstances was a material consideration.   Such  factor  is
    nuanced with the consideration in terms of  genuine  residence,  as  to
    whether that was somewhere that they really wanted to be  and  to  grow
    family life.  The finding of the Judge, set out in paragraph 44, was to
    the contrary namely that it was only a temporary move to facilitate re-
    entry into the United Kingdom.  He specifically found that  the  centre
    of the sponsor's life was not transferred to Ireland and the nature  of
    the accommodation they rented undermined any such  claims.   The  Judge
    found that there was no evidence of integration other than  school  and
    medical registration.

23.  It seems to me that those findings are properly open to be made in  the
    assessment of Regulation 9(3).

24.  It is also apparent from the determination that the Judge  went  on  to
    consider in some detail Regulation 9(4).   Motivation  and  purpose  is
    very much put into issue by the Regulation.  The Judge noted  that  the
    sponsor, had he remained in the United Kingdom, would not have been  in
    a position to have sponsored the appellants to join him.

25.   A  relevant  matter  was  that  set  out  in  paragraph  37   of   the
    determination, that the  Presenting  Officer  produced  at  the  appeal
    hearing  a  letter  from  the  first  appellant  dated  3rd  July  2017
    specifically referred to in the refusal decision and addressed  to  the
    respondent providing information requested from the Home  Office.   The
    first appellant stated at page  8  that  her  British  citizen  sponsor
    always wanted her and the children to join in  the  United  Kingdom  as
    soon as he received his settled status.  But they could not do  so  due
    to his financial circumstances.  The sponsor had initially  been  on  a
    very limited earnings due to his inability to speak proper English  and
    lack of education.  His earnings fell short to sponsor a  large  family
    as the British citizen Sponsor he needed  almost  �30,000  earnings  to
    sponsor everyone in the family.  The letter went on to say that despite
    the sponsor's best efforts he could not reach the  requisite  level  of
    earning.  The Judge found this to be significant evidence  pointing  to
    the fact that the appellants and the sponsor  always  intended  to  use
    Ireland as effectively a staging post so that  they  could  then  leave
    Ireland and proceed to seek settlement in the United Kingdom under  the
    2016  Regulations  and  thus  avoid  the  more   stringent   settlement
    requirements under the UK immigration laws.

26.  At the appeal hearing itself the Judge heard evidence  from  the  first
    appellant who adopted her witness statement of 27 July 2018.  She  said
    that she had entered Ireland in August 2015 with a  visa  to  join  her
    husband who had recently migrated there from  the  UK  on  a  potential
    business opportunity from her friend.  The four children also travelled
    to Ireland so that they could live together as  a  family  having  been
    separated for fifteen years.

27.  It is significant in that connection that the Judge did not accept  the
    credibility of the potential business opportunity that was claimed.

28.  Also the explanation for returning to the United Kingdom because  there
    was insufficient work, was to be considered in the light  of  the  only
    accepted evidence that the sponsor only worked for two months  in  that
    period.

29.  In the overall assessment the Judge noted the lack of  work  and  short
    term tenancies and the lack of credibility for the explanations offered
    as to why the sponsor had gone to Ireland and concluded the purpose  of
    the residence was as a means to circumvent the immigration laws.  Those
    findings were properly open to be made in all the circumstances.

30.  Challenge is made to the burden  of  proof  and  that  needs  a  little
    consideration.  In paragraph 2 the Judge  states  that  the  burden  of
    proof  is  upon  the  appellants  to  demonstrate  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that the refusal decisions are not in accordance with the
    above mentioned Regulations.  That perhaps in reality is  to  telescope
    or conjoin two matters that require to be considered separately.

31.  The burden of proof is upon the appellants to show that  residence  was
    genuine, namely a desire to be established in a  particular  community.
    For the reasons are set out in the determination the  Judge  has  found
    that the appellants have failed  to  satisfy  that  requirement.   That
    finding it seems to me would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal.

32.  The Judge went on however to consider  the  application  of  Regulation
    9(4)(a). It would seem that the burden would rest upon  the  respondent
    rather than the appellant.  However, given the  clear  and  unequivocal
    findings made by the Judge on that aspect, it would seem that even  had
    the Judge properly reminded himself of that burden, he would have found
    it to have been discharged.

33.  Given the findings as to residence and intention I  do  not  find  that
    any error as to the burden of proof in respect of purpose  is  material
    to the outcome of this appeal.

34.  In all the circumstances the appellants' appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal
    is dismissed.  The decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  shall  stand
    namely that the appeals  are  dismissed  under  the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations.

No anonymity direction is made.
