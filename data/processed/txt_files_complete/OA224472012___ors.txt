Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Harrison, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr Holt, Counsel instructed by Reiss Solicitors





                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer, to whom I shall refer  in
    this determination as the "claimant".

2.   The respondents are Pakistani nationals born  1st  January,  1968,  6th
    October, 1996, 10th July, 1998 and 6th  December,  2001,  respectively.
    On 16th July, 2012 the respondents applied for a visa to enable them to
    join Saqib Mahmood Butt ("the sponsor") in  the  United  Kingdom.   The
    sponsor is the husband of the first respondent and  together  they  are
    the parents of the second, third and fourth respondents.

3.    The  respondents'  applications  were  refused  by  the  claimant   in
    Islamabad on 11th October, 2012.  The  first  respondent's  application
    was  refused  because  the  claimant  was  not   satisfied   that   the
    relationship between the first named respondent  and  her  partner  was
    genuine and subsisting and because the respondent had  failed  to  meet
    the financial requirements.  The  remaining  respondents'  applications
    were  refused  because  the  claimant  had  refused  the  first   named
    respondent's application.

4.   The respondent's appealed and their appeal  was  heard  by  First  Tier
    Tribunal Judge Buster Cox who allowed their appeals in a  determination
    promulgated on 23rd August, 2013.  The judge found the  sponsor  to  be
    credible and he accepted the sponsor's evidence.   He  found  that  the
    first named respondent and the sponsor were and are in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.

5.   In relation to financial requirements, the respondent  needed  to  show
    that the sponsor had an annual income of at least �27,200.   The  judge
    set  out  the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  and  the   first   named
    respondent's Counsel acknowledged that not all the  specified  evidence
    in respect of the sponsor's  self-employment  had  been  provided.   He
    acknowledged that the judge could not take into account any income from
    the sponsor's  self-employment  and  the  sponsor  had  not  adequately
    demonstrated for the purposes of the Rules that he  had  an  income  of
    �27,200.  He found, therefore, that the first named respondent did  not
    meet the financial requirements of the eligibility rules  and  did  not
    therefore meet all of the eligibility requirements.  He found that  the
    decision of the claimant was in accordance with the Immigration  Rules.



6.   The judge went on to consider the respondents'  human  rights  appeals.
    He concluded that the sponsor earned and  continues  to  earn  a  "good
    living" as sole proprietor of a business and noted that it was not easy
    for the sponsor to travel to Pakistan due to his work commitments.   He
    believed that the appeal was finely balanced, but that requiring a self-
    employed person to provide personal bank statements for a twelve  month
    period covered by a statement of account is not  particularly  onerous.
    On the other hand, he was entirely satisfied  that  the  businesses  of
    which the sponsor was sole  proprietor  and  a  partner  were  "ongoing
    concerns" and provided him with a "regular source of income" that would
    have been more than sufficient to meet the needs for  himself  and  the
    respondents.  He noted that the respondent had paid fees of over �2,500
    and that if the sponsor stayed in Pakistan for  anything  more  than  a
    short break, there would be a detrimental impact on  his  earnings  and
    profits.  Either the sponsor continues to be separated from his  family
    for at least a further three months or he goes to Pakistan which  could
    then undermine his ability  to  demonstrate  that  he  could  meet  the
    financial requirements of the Rules.  He found on the particular  facts
    of this  appeal  that  the  decision  amounted  to  a  disproportionate
    interference with the rights of the sponsor to enjoy  respect  for  his
    family life and allow the appeal.

7.    The  claimant  challenged  the  determination  in   lengthy   grounds,
    suggesting that since the appeal failed under the Immigration Rules, it
    should only succeed under the European Convention for the Protection of
    Human Rights and  Fundamental  Freedoms  if  it  was  found  to  be  an
    exceptional  case.   In   this   context   "exceptional"   meant   that
    circumstances in which, although the requirements  had  not  been  met,
    refusal would result in an unjustified,  harsh  outcome.   The  grounds
    argued  that  this  case  was  not  exceptional  simply   because   the
    respondents had failed to provide the specified evidence, and  as  such
    the judge had misdirected himself in law.  He had attached  significant
    weight to the sponsor's income, which was said to be significantly more
    than the average wage, but it was quite clearly the wrong basis to make
    such an assessment, as the minimum wage was not based upon the size  of
    any family.  The minimum income threshold adopted was following  expert
    advice from the Migration Advisory Committee and subject  to  extensive
    consultation it was suggested that it was inappropriate therefore  that
    the Tribunal should  disregard  these  points  in  its  proportionality
    assessment.

8.   Mr Harrison relied on the grounds.  Mr Holt suggested that the  sponsor
    had not been in a position to provide any more information than he did.
     The judge was clearly entitled to have regard to the fact that fees of
    �2,500 had been paid and that the claimant took three months  in  which
    to make its decision.  As a result, if the appeal were not allowed this
    would mean that the sponsor would have to wait a further  three  months
    before he was joined by his family, or  he  would  have  to  leave  his
    business  and  thereby  jeopardise  the  chances  of  the   respondents
    qualifying under the Immigration Rules, while he went to Pakistan.

9.   Mr Holt was anxious  to  point  out  that  this  was  not  a  near-miss
    situation and that the judge's decision  had  been  taken  outside  the
    Rules and on the question  of  proportionality.   First  Tier  Tribunal
    Judge Cox considered the sponsor's status  as  a  British  citizen  and
    found the relationship between the sponsor and the  respondents  to  be
    genuine.  He found the sponsor's income to be satisfactory  and  placed
    significant weight on his income and on his nationality.   Mr  Harrison
    urged me to find that this  was  a  decision  which  was  not  unlawful
    because it was effectively a near-miss decision.  He asked me  to  note
    that latitude had been given simply because  the  respondents  did  not
    meet the requirements of the Rules.

10.  I reserved my decision.

11.  The judge found himself satisfied as to the  relationship  between  the
    first named respondent and the sponsor and found that they  were  in  a
    genuine and subsisting relationship.  He concluded that the first named
    respondent did not meet the financial requirements of  the  eligibility
    rules and did not therefore meet all of the  eligibility  requirements.
    He found the decision of the claimant to  be  in  accordance  with  the
    Immigration Rules.

12.  The judge found that the sponsor had provided  most  of  the  documents
    required under Appendix FM as a self-employed person, but had failed to
    provide copies of his bank statements for the year covering  1st  July,
    2011 and 30th June, 2012.  At the hearing before the judge the  sponsor
    indicated that he now had three bank accounts and the judge noted  that
    the statement provided regular cash deposits.  However the sponsor  was
    not asked at the hearing why he had not  provided  statements  for  the
    whole of the period covered by his statement of account.

13.  The judge referred to and quote paragraphs 142  to  146  of  MM  [2013]
    EWHC 1900, High Court Admin and the judge noted that Blake  J  had  not
    considered  whether  those  parts  of  the  Rules  requiring   specific
    documents for self-employed persons were disproportionate.   The  judge
    recognised that the appeal was  finely  balanced  and  recognised  that
    there are legitimate and necessary reasons for requiring  an  appellant
    to  provide  supporting  documentary  evidence   of   their   financial
    circumstances.   Requiring  a  self-employed  person  to  provide   the
    personal bank statements for the same twelve month period covered by  a
    statement of account is not particularly onerous and as he pointed out,
    Article 8 does not give an individual the right to  choose  where  they
    can live with their family.  The judge  concluded  that  the  sponsor's
    rights outweigh the claimant's  legitimate  interest  in  ensuring  the
    economic  and  social  order  when  maintaining  effective  immigration
    control and the judge said that he attached significant weight  to  the
    rights that flow from the sponsor's status as a British citizen and  he
    attaches significant weight to the sponsor's income which, he said, was
    significantly more than the minimum wage.

14.  Whilst the judge's decision is not necessarily one that  I  would  have
    made in similar circumstances, that is not the test.  With  very  great
    respect to Mr Harrison I do not believe  that  the  judge  allowed  the
    respondents' Article 8, appeal because they had nearly  missed  meeting
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  I have concluded  that  the
    judge's decision was one which was open to him on the  evidence  before
    him.  He was entitled to give significant weight to the fact  that  the
    sponsor is a British subject and that the option of  re-applying  would
    not be reasonable.  I find that the judge did not err  in  law  in  his
    determination which I uphold.
