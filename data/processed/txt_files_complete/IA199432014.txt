For the Appellant:     Mr M Sabir, of MBS, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mrs M O'Brien, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a determination by Designated  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Murray promulgated on 31st  July  2014,  dismissing  her
    appeal against refusal of leave to remain.  She accepted that she could
    not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules, and argued her case
    under Article 8 of the ECHR only.

 2. (To avoid any further procedural confusion, it should be noted that the
    purported notice of appeal by the appellant's daughter  (IA/19977/2014)
    was subject to a notice of no valid appeal issued  on  27th  May  2014.
    There are no extant proceedings in which she is an appellant.   She  is
    involved only as a dependant.  The grant of permission to appeal to the
    Upper Tribunal errs in identifying two appellants.)





The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal.



 3. The grounds are clear and quite detailed.  They were  reproduced  as  a
    skeleton argument, to which Mr Sabir  initially  had  nothing  to  add.
    Five main points are raised:

         (i)      (paragraph 2 of the  grounds):  at  paragraph  55  of  the
             determination the judge failed to take account of all relevant
             circumstances;  did  not  see  that   there   were   no   real
             inconsistencies in the evidence concerning a relative  of  the
             appellant's partner, said to be  a  brother,  half-brother  or
             uncle, and about whether the appellant and her partner met  in
             Edinburgh or in London; and if there were any inconsistencies,
             failed to take account of the explanations for them;

         (ii)     (paragraph 3): at paragraph 57, in deciding to give little
             weight to a letter from an advocate in Ghana, the judge failed
             to ask herself the correct question;  should  not  have  found
             that the information conveyed in the letter, stemming from the
             appellant's guardian, was from a partial  or  tainted  source;
             and should not have found that the fact that  the  letter  was
             designed to support the appeal detracted from its veracity;

         (iii)    (at the end of paragraph 3): the judge failed  to  address
             whether it would be unduly harsh to expect the appellant, with
             her 4 year old child, to relocate in Ghana;

         (iv) (paragraph 4): at paragraph 58, the judge failed to conduct  a
             separate assessment  of  the  best  interests  of  the  child,
             wrongly taking it that her partner, who is  an  EEA  national,
             might also go to Ghana;

           v) (paragraph 5): at paragraph 60, the judge failed to  consider
              the appellant's mental  health  problems  in  the  Article  8
              context,  which  raises  different  considerations  from   an
              Article 3 health case.




Submissions for respondent.



 4. The main allegation of factual error was about where  the  relationship
    between the appellant and her partner  began.   The  appellant's  uncle
    says in his statement at paragraph  11,  "Shortly  after  we  moved  to
    Edinburgh, Ivious  met  her  current  partner  Daniel.   They  began  a
    relationship in September 2012 and have been in the  relationship  ever
    since".   Although  that  was  not  a  specific  statement   that   the
    relationship began in Edinburgh, that was its natural reading.  It  did
    not show that the judge had fallen into a misconception and  could  not
    be characterised as a clear error of fact.



 5. In any event, paragraph 55 of the determination set out  several  other
    problems with this chapter of the  evidence,  in  which  the  appellant
    identified no possible errors.   There  was  nothing  to  displace  the
    adverse credibility finding.

 6.  Although  there  was  evidence  about  the  mental  condition  of  the
    appellant's uncle, it did not suggest confusion, memory problems or any
    other difficulty in giving evidence.  There was no basis  for  treating
    his evidence with any extra latitude.

 7. Regarding the letter from the advocate in  Ghana,  the  judge  had  not
    fallen into the error of treating it in isolation or as tainted  simply
    because the information came from the appellant's side.  The  item  was
    approached in the context of the  appellant  making  "a  veiled  asylum
    claim" which she never properly pursued and  which  she  outlined  only
    after she had spent a long time in the UK.  The judge was  entitled  to
    take these features into account.  Even if  the  judge  erred  on  this
    point, the letter was insufficient to suggest that  the  appellant  had
    any difficulty in returning to Ghana.  She made no protection claim and
    relied on Article 8 only.  There was no error in making  a  comment  on
    availability of internal  relocation,  but  that  was  only  an  aside,
    because the appellant did not show that she was in need of Article 3 or
    Refugee Convention protection in relation to any part of Ghana.

 8. The only relevant information placed  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    about the child's best  interests  appeared  to  be  that  she  was  at
    nursery, would soon be starting primary school and that  the  appellant
    had a partner.  Even on the appellant's contentions that partner is not
    the child's natural or adoptive father.  Her grounds suggested that the
    judge considered that the appellant's partner might be forced to remove
    to Ghana, but there was no question of that.  It was an unobjectionable
    to observe that it was possible for him to do so.  The  judge  had  not
    treated that as anything but a matter of choice.  In any event, on  her
    adverse credibility findings there was no family unit to  consider  for
    Article 8 purposes.

 9. As  to  the  aspect  of  the  appellant's  heath,  there  had  been  no
    significant evidence about that before the First-tier Tribunal  either.
    There was nothing to call for any further extended treatment.   Medical
    considerations  might  play  in  principle   play   a   part   in   the
    proportionality outcome, but in substance none were raised.

10. Finally, Mrs O'Brien  submitted  that  the  challenge  to  the  adverse
    credibility conclusion was crucial.  If that stood, none of  the  other
    challenges were significant.



Response for appellant.



11. Mr Sabir agreed that the challenge to the adverse credibility  findings
    was primary, and that if that did not succeed the other challenges fell
    away.  It therefore became common ground  that  if  error  were  to  be
    identified the case would be apt for remit to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    for a fresh hearing.

12. Mr Sabir said that the crux was that the judge failed to  approach  the
    evidence from the appellant's uncle correctly.  It was  a  point  which
    might have made all the difference regarding  the  credibility  of  her
    relationship  with  her  partner.   If  that  had   been   established,
    proportionality would have been considered  on  an  entirely  different
    basis.



Conclusions.



13. The judge said that she did not give much weight to the letter from the
    advocate in Ghana.  In the context of all the evidence and reading  the
    determination as a whole, that is a  conclusion  she  was  entitled  to
    reach.  She did not disregard it only because it tends  to  favour  the
    appellant.

14. The judge's observation about internal relocation  is  incidental,  and
    entirely valid.

15. Strictly construed, the uncle's statement is specific  about  when  the
    appellant and her partner  met,  not  where  they  met.   However,  the
    obvious and natural meaning of the relevant passage is that the meeting
    was in Edinburgh.  The appellant has not persuaded me  that  the  judge
    erred in reading the passage as inconsistent with other evidence.

16. Importantly, paragraph 55 goes on to identify further discrepancies  in
    the evidence about when, where and for how long  the  parties  were  in
    contact and with whom they stayed.   The  medical  evidence  about  the
    appellant's uncle does nothing to  explain  away  these  discrepancies.
    The judge also found the appellant's  partner  to  be  an  unclear  and
    unreliable witness.  The Upper Tribunal should  be  slow  to  interfere
    with findings reached by the judge who has had the advantage of hearing
    directly from the three witnesses.

17. The judge had other reasons for coming  to  an  adverse  conclusion  on
    credibility.  For example, there was the illogicality of the  appellant
    saying that she developed an  ectopic  pregnancy  and  lost  her  child
    because she was kicked.  The judge was unsurprisingly sceptical of  the
    claim  that  the  appellant's  uncle  would  have  paid  ï¿½1,500  to   a
    businessman to get the appellant to the UK from Ghana  yet  would  have
    been was unaware that a false document was used for that purpose.   The
    appellant's partner said that he wished to adopt the child but had made
    no enquiries and had no knowledge about her biological  father.   Those
    were all valid points which have not been disputed.





18. The appellant's representatives have done their best to burrow out such
    errors as might be found, but I am not  satisfied  that  there  is  any
    material flaw in the judge's overall  adverse  credibility  conclusion.
    It was reached for several sustainable reasons.  The determination as a
    whole is a more than adequate explanation to the appellant of  why  her
    case has been found to fall short of probation.

19. As said in the determination at paragraph 63 and  as  accepted  by  the
    parties before me, credibility was crucial.  The case  might  not  have
    succeeded outwith  the  Rules  even  on  the  most  favourable  factual
    findings, but on the findings actually reached  it  had  no  prospects.
    There was no reason to think that the child's best interests  would  be
    adversely affected by her return to Ghana with her mother.

20. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.

21. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
