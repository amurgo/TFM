                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   In January 2010 Mr Keou  arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  with  entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 Migrant.  He has been studying here  ever  since,
    and before the expiry date of his most recent period of leave  on  15th
    November 2012 he applied on 28th September 2012 for  further  leave  to
    remain in order to study at the University of East London for a  BA  in
    Accountancy and Finance.  The application was refused on 27th  December
    2012 because, although Mr Keou had paid in  full  the  course  fees  of
    �9,900 for his first year at the university,  he  was  unable  to  show
    maintenance funds of �2,000 for a continuous period of 28 days,  ending
    on 26th September 2012.  Between  5th  and  9th  September  the  credit
    balance in his mother's account with the Union  Bank  of  Cameroon  was
    only the equivalent  of  �104.97  (caused  by  the  withdrawal  on  5th
    September of CFA francs 3,600,000, although this was  followed  on  9th
    September by a deposit of CFA francs 7,000,000 ~ a  sum  equivalent  to
    well over �9,000).

2.    Because Mr Keou  had  not  scored  10  points  for  Maintenance  under
    Appendix C to the Immigration Rules, he was refused  further  leave  to
    remain, and at the same time a decision was made to  remove  him  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.  Notice
    of appeal was sent  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  professionally
    drafted grounds, although no representative was named  on  the  notice.
    In one of the grounds it is asserted  that,  while  the  Border  Agency
    considered the bank statement from Mr Keou's parents, no  consideration
    was given to the bank statements in his own name  which  Mr  Keou  also
    submitted, and which covered  the  same  period.   It  does  not  seem,
    however, that  any  other  bank  statements  were  submitted  with  the
    application, and this was  indeed  acknowledged  by  Mr  Kumi  when  he
    appeared before Judge Nicholas Bennett on 10th April 2013.

3.   Instead, a statement of Mr Keou's account with HSBC  was  produced  for
    the First-tier hearing, and this showed that during the  28-day  period
    for which Mr Keou  needed  to  demonstrate  funds  of  �2,000  for  the
    purposes of his application, he had between �1,300 and  �2,300  in  his
    own account.  Between 5th and 7th September, when his mother's  account
    had dropped to just over �100, he had �1,300 in his  HSBC  account,  so
    the total still did not reach the �2,000 needed.  Pay slips  were  also
    proffered, showing that Mr  Keou  earned  �866  in  August  2012  as  a
    security guard, and �750 in September.   That  was  not  the  same,  of
    course, as having money in the bank, and the upshot was  that  Mr  Keou
    could not show funds in his own and  his  mother's  accounts  totalling
    �2,000 for three days out of the 28 needed.

4.   Mr Kumi very sensibly conceded  at  the  First-tier  hearing  that  the
    appeal could not succeed under the Rules, and relied instead on Article
    8.  Having first explained that Mr Keou did not fall within the Article
    8 provisions of paragraph 276ADE, Judge Bennett  turned  to  Article  8
    more generally, and observed that the relatively  short  period  during
    which Mr Keou's funds  fell  below  the  �2,000  threshold  was  not  a
    sufficient reason for finding that removal would  be  disproportionate.
    There was no "near miss" principle, and in this instance the  shortfall
    was significant.

5.   Nevertheless,  Judge  Bennett  was  satisfied  that  removal  would  be
    disproportionate, because it would prevent Mr Keou from completing  his
    studies.  He had paid �9,900 in course fees, and had invested  time  in
    his studies.  Although his attendance record at the university had  not
    been good during the early part of the first term, there had only  been
    a few absences since the end of October.  It was clear from the healthy
    balances in his bank account that he had no trouble meeting his  living
    expenses.  The appeal was allowed under Article 8,  and  Judge  Bennett
    also directed that Mr Keou should be  granted  leave  to  remain  as  a
    student until 30th June 2015, the end of his course at  the  University
    of East London.

6.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  sought  on  the  ground
    that "it is crystal clear that the judge is relying on  the  near  miss
    argument rejected by the Court of Appeal in Miah & Others  [2012]  EWCA
    Civ 261."  It was also contended that the judge's direction for a grant
    of leave to remain was irrational.  Permission  was  granted  by  Judge
    Astle on the strength of these grounds, and when the appeal came before
    me today I heard detailed submissions from Mr Avery and  Mr  Kumi,  the
    latter adducing a skeleton  argument  and  four  authorities.   In  the
    upshot, however, the Secretary of State's principal  challenge  can  be
    dismissed in short order.  It is crystal clear that Judge  Bennett  did
    not rely on a near-miss argument.  He expressly disavowed such reliance
    at paragraph 22 of his determination.  The appeal was allowed for quite
    different reasons, which I have summarised above.  Those  reasons  were
    not challenged in the grounds of appeal, and  in  the  absence  of  any
    further written submissions or skeleton argument from the Secretary  of
    State, the effect of the Directions  sent  on  7th  June  is  that  the
    appellant is taken to be "relying solely on  the  grounds  for  seeking
    permission to appeal."  Although Mr Avery observed, quite rightly, than
    an Article 8 claim rarely succeeds just on private life, it  cannot  be
    said that the judge's reasons are  obviously  perverse  or  irrational,
    such that I should  set  the  First-tier  decision  aside  despite  the
    absence of a  specific  challenge  in  the  grounds.   Judge  Bennett's
    decision to allow the appeal against the  refusal  to  vary  Mr  Keou's
    leave therefore stands.

7.   On the other hand, both Mr Avery and Mr Kumi agreed  with  me  that  it
    was not appropriate (a preferable epithet to  "irrational")  for  Judge
    Bennett to direct that leave  to  remain  be  granted  for  a  specific
    period.  It is not usually necessary to give such a direction  at  all,
    but especially when an appeal has been allowed under Article 8.   Leave
    is then granted outside  the  Immigration  Rules,  on  a  discretionary
    basis.  The Secretary of State can  exercise  her  discretion  unaided,
    although in the present case it may well be sensible for her  to  grant
    leave for the remainder of Mr Keou's course, as  Judge  Bennett  wished
    her to do.

8.   Both representatives were also agreed  upon  an  issue  which  had  not
    hitherto been raised, namely that the decision to remove  Mr  Keou  was
    unlawful : see Ahmadi [2013] EWCA Civ 512.  Section 47 of the 2006  Act
    has been  substituted  from  8th  May  2013  with  provisions  for  the
    simultaneous  service  of  a  "pre-removal  decision"  and  a   removal
    decision.  But prior to that date, such a procedure was unlawful.

     DECISION

     The Secretary of  State's  appeal,  in  respect  of  variation  of  the
    respondent's leave, is dismissed.

     The direction by the First-tier Tribunal for  the  grant  of  leave  to
    remain is set aside.

     The Secretary of  State's  decision  to  remove  the  respondent  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006 was  not
    in accordance with the law.
