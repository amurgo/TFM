Representation:

For the Appellant:     Miss R Dulay, of Counsel instructed by Sam
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant appeals, with permission, against a decision of Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Widdup who, in a determination  promulgated  on
    19 July 2017,  dismissed the appellant's appeal against a  decision  of
    the Entry Clearance Officer, New Delhi to refuse him entry clearance to
    join his parents in Britain as their dependant.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born on 13 April 1989.  His  father
    was a former Gurkha soldier who obtained leave  to  settle  in  Britain
    with his wife in April 2012.  They have lived in Britain since May that
    year.  On entry they were accompanied by their youngest son, who it was
    accepted by the judge lives with them.  They also have an older son who
    lives in Britain and a daughter who remained in Nepal.

3.    The appellant's application for entry  clearance  was  refused  on  18
    January 2016. In the refusal the Entry Clearance Officer stated:-

         "You state that you are unemployed and emotionally and  financially
         dependent on your parents.  You were 26 years and eight  months  at
         the date of application.  Your parents had migrated to  the  UK  by
         choice over 3 years and 8 months before the  date  of  application.
         There is no evidence of any care arrangements put in place by  your
         sponsors before they migrated to the  United  Kingdom.   That  your
         parents were content to leave for the United  Kingdom  without  you
         and without making any obvious care arrangements are factors I have
         considered.  Your parents have stated that you are not  leading  an
         independent life as you are unmarried and receive financial support
         from your father.   The  fact  that  you  are  unmarried  does  not
         automatically mean that  you  are  emotionally  dependent  on  your
         parents, your parents stated that it  is  customary  in  Nepal  for
         adults to remain with their parents until they marry.  However your
         parents decided to go against tradition by moving to the UK without
         you and I am satisfied that  your  parents  decided  to  split  the
         family as they were satisfied that you could look  after  yourself.
         In view of  the  circumstances  presented  I  am  minded  that  the
         decision was made by your parents that as an adult you were able to
         care for yourself.

         You are in good health, educated to senior secondary  standard  and
         have spent the majority of your life in Nepal.  You state that  you
         are unemployed yet there are no obvious factors preventing you from
         working  in  Nepal.   There  is  no  suggestion  that  your  living
         conditions are anything but adequate.  There is no  obvious  reason
         why your father is unable to continue to support you financially if
         you are to remain in Nepal.

         You have not declared any  care  arrangements  or  requirements  in
         Nepal.  You have not mentioned any personal incapacity and you have
         not declared any medical conditions or disability.  For  the  above
         reasons I am not satisfied that you are wholly  financially  and/or
         emotionally dependent on your UK sponsor as required under Annex K,
         Paragraph 9(5) of the IDI Chapter 15 Section 2A 13.2."

4.   At the hearing the appellant's mother stated that he was  dependent  on
    his parents financially and emotionally.  Neither she nor  her  husband
    could now return to Nepal although she had  visited  twice  in  January
    2015 and February 2016 and during those visits she had stayed with  the
    appellant.  She stated that they were in contact two or three  times  a
    day.  She asserted that the appellant had only applied to enter Britain
    in 2016 because until that time those who were 30 or  under  could  not
    apply.   She said that her son was dependent on  her  and  her  husband
    because he was their son and that they wanted to live together  instead
    of living apart.  They sent him ï¿½100 per month.

5.   She said that the appellant lived in Belbari in  a  rented  property  -
    there was no family home.  She  and  her  husband   had  lived  in  the
    Belbari property but only one room was now rented.  She confirmed  that
    the appellant had studied up to grade 10 at school but  she  could  not
    remember what age he was when he left school.

6.   The appellant's brother said that in 2009 his father had a pension  and
    they had a small amount of land where the appellant's  younger  brother
    had worked and he had also worked on someone else's land.  He said that
    his brother could not work on the family land because it had been  sold
    before his parents came to Britain.

7.   In paragraphs  33  onwards  the  judge  set  out  his  conclusions  and
    findings of fact.  He stated  that  it  was  uncontroversial  that  the
    appellant's father had served in the British Army for seven years until
    December 1964, that the appellant's father and his wife had arrived  in
    Britain on 14 May 2012 and that they had four children - two in Britain
    and two in Nepal or India.  The appellant had been aged 26 at the  date
    of application.

8.   The judge accepted that the appellant's younger brother was a  credible
    witness  and  it  is  clear  from  the  determination  that   he   made
    considerable allowances for discrepancies in the  appellant's  mother's
    evidence and indeed the  small  discrepancy  in  the  evidence  of  his
    younger brother.

9.   In paragraph 40 he posed two questions - did family  life  continue  to
    exist between the appellant and his parents notwithstanding the age  of
    the appellant and their separation, and if  so,  could  the  respondent
    show that her decision was proportionate.  He then went on to say  that
    he would consider whether or not there was interference with the  right
    to respect for the family or private life,  and  if  so,  whether  such
    interference have consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage
    the operation of Article 8.  If so, was it in accordance with  the  law
    and did that interference have a legitimate aim, and  if  so,  was  the
    interference proportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved.

10.  He emphasised that he had taken into account the terms of the  judgment
    of the Court of Appeal in Rai v  Entry  Clearance  Officer,  New  Delhi
    [2017] EWCA Civ 320.  Although  he pointed that  that  case  was  fact-
    sensitive.

11.  In paragraph 43 he noted that  Lindblom  LJ  had  identified  the  real
    issue in that case which was whether, as a matter of fact, family  life
    existed when  the  parents  left  Nepal  and  whether  it  had  endured
    notwithstanding their having left Nepal.

12.  He referred to the judgement of Sedley LJ in Kugathas where  Sedley  LJ
    had  referred  to  the  need  for  evidence  of  "further  elements  of
    dependency  involving  more  than  the  normal  emotional  ties"   when
    assessing a relationship between an adult and  his  parents.   In  that
    judgment Sedley LJ stated:  "If dependency  is  read  down  as  meaning
    "support" in the personal sense and if one adds "real"  or  "committed"
    or "effective" to the word "support" then it represents the irreducible
    minimum of what family life implies".

13.  The judge referred to the  evidence  of  financial  dependency  in  the
    witness statements and evidence of remittances sent to the appellant in
    Nepal and said that that was not  challenged  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer or by the Presenting Officer at the hearing  and  he  therefore
    accepted that the appellant was financially dependent on his father.  I
    would comment that there is no evidence before me  that  the  issue  of
    financial dependency was conceded either by the Entry Clearance Officer
    or by the Presenting Officer at the hearing.

14.  The judge went on at paragraph 50 to state  that  emotional  dependency
    was more difficult to assess, pointing out that the dependency  had  to
    be that of the appellant upon his parents rather  than  the  other  way
    round.  He pointed out that the evidence related to the  understandable
    wish of the parents to be re-united with their son.  It  is  said  that
    their separation had occurred in 2012.  The evidence in the bundle  was
    that it was asserted that  the  appellant's  parents  depended  on  the
    appellant emotionally.  The judge however took the view that the  child
    on which they depended was their son Niram,   who lives with them.   He
    stated therefore that the case that the appellant should also undertake
    that role was much less strong than it would otherwise be  and  he  did
    not accept therefore that the  evidence  supported  the  case  that  an
    emotional dependency arose in this case either of the appellant on  the
    parents or of the parents on the appellant.  He  therefore  found  that
    Article 8 was not engaged and he did not need  to  go  on  to  consider
    proportionality or the issue relating to the historic injustice.

15.  The grounds of appeal argued that the judge  had  erred  in  concluding
    that Article 8 was not engaged.  There was evidence  that  family  life
    existed with the appellant and  his  parents  as  they  had  all  lived
    together in Nepal and there was evidence  of  continuing   family  life
    since they have arrived in Britain, and therefore the judge had  failed
    to engage with the relevant question of whether or not such family life
    existed. Reference was made to the decision of the Tribunal in  Ghising
    (family life - adults - Gurkha policy) [2012] UKUT 00160 (IAC) and  the
    Court of Appeal judgment in  Rai.   It  was  suggested  the  judge  had
    applied a test of "exceptionality" in order to determine the  level  of
    dependency between the appellant and his parents.  It was  stated  that
    the judge had considered the issue of dependency in the context of  the
    appellant's dependency on his parents rather than the  inter-dependency
    between his parents and him and vice versa.  It  was  stated  that  the
    judge had failed to take into account the  impact  on  the  appellant's
    brother if he continued solely to continue in the role as carer of  his
    parents.  It was stated the judge had erred by making  no  findings  on
    whether or not the appellant was still an integral part of  the  family
    unit and had not formed his own independent unit;  the  appellant  does
    not have any other close family  members  for  support  in  Nepal,  the
    regular contact between the appellant and his parents in  Britain,  and
    the reason why his father was unable to visit him.  It is  argued  that
    it is an error of law for there to be no  clear  findings  of  fact  on
    those issues.

16.  Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Hollingworth  granted  permission  to
    appeal stating:-

         "It is arguable that the Judge has set out an insufficient analysis
         at paragraph 57 of the decision, leading  to  the  conclusion  that
         there were no ties beyond normal emotional ties giving  rise  to  a
         dependency.  It is arguable that  the  Judge  has  taken  an  over-
         restrictive approach to the breadth of the relevant  considerations
         to a finding of whether Article 8 was engaged.  It is arguable  the
         Judge should have set out a fuller analysis as to the existence  of
         family life when the Appellant and his parents  lived  together  in
         Nepal and the question of whether a continuum existed following the
         arrival of the Appellant's parents in the United Kingdom and in the
         alternative findings as to the cessation of such a  continuum.   It
         is arguable that  sufficient  evidence  existed  to  conclude  that
         Article 8 was engaged and that the Judge should have embarked  upon
         a proportionality exercise."

17.  A Rule 24 notice was submitted by the Specialist  Appeals  Team  on  17
    November 2017.  The notice stated:-

         "3.  The FTTJ has essentially found that  the  appellant's  parents
             seek to be dependent  on  him  (although  the  carer  role  is
             carried out by their other son Niram Rai) and that he  is  not
             emotionally dependent upon them, therefore  family  life  does
             not exist  and  this  is  consistent  with  Kugathas.   It  is
             therefore  asserted  that  the  FTTJ  properly  came  to  this
             conclusion and no material error is disclosed."

18.  At the hearing to the  appeal  before  me  Miss  Dulay  relied  on  the
    grounds of appeal stating that the judge had erred in not  taking  into
    account the issue of the appellant's life at the time of departure  and
    whether or not that had continued to endure.

19.  She asserted that the judge had failed to  grapple  with  those  issues
    and emphasised there was nothing regarding family life at the  time  of
    departure.   Moreover  the  judge  had  not  considered  if  there  was
    effective support at the time of separation and had erred therefore  in
    not making any Article 8 assessment.

20.   She  stated  that  in  paragraph  57  the  judge  had  erred  in   his
    consideration of whether or not there were more than  normal  emotional
    ties.  She stated that the judge should have  looked at the  Article  8
    rights of both the appellant's parents and the appellant in the round.

21.  With regard to the issue of whether or not there is evidence  that  the
    appellant was  not leading  an  independent  life  she  referred  to  a
    certificate showing that the appellant was unmarried and  stated  there
    is evidence from the appellant's  parents  about  the  difficulties  in
    obtaining work in Nepal.

22.  In reply Ms Pal stated the judge had set out the Article  8  provisions
    regarding family life and had properly referred to the judgment in  Rai
    and that of Sedley LJ in Kugathas.

23.  She had noted the assertion that there had  been  emotional  dependence
    and said that the judge had taken this into account.  There was nothing
    before him sufficient to show that there was family life in  existence.
    In reply Miss Dulay stated there was no challenge to the  finding  that
    there was financial dependency and referred to  the  letters  from  the
    local community relating to the dependency  of  the  appellant  on  his
    parents.  The fact that the test as set out in Rai - that as to whether
    or not the appellant had been dependent on his parents  when  they  had
    left Nepal and now had not been properly considered by the judge.

Discussion

24.  This is a  detailed  determination  in  which  the  judge  gives  clear
    reasons for his decision. However, I consider that, although the  judge
    set out the relevant test in Kugathas he did  not  properly  apply  the
    test in Rai in that there were insufficient findings regarding  whether
    or not the appellant was exercising family life with both  his  parents
    and was dependent on his parents  before  they  left  for  Britain  and
    secondly after their departure until the date of application.  While he
    found that the appellant was financially dependent on his  parents  and
    considered the issue of emotional dependence I consider that he had not
    properly considered the issues of whether  or  not  the  appellant  was
    living an independent life from his parents both before and  after  his
    parents came to Britain. He did not engage with the assertions  of  the
    appellant's mother that she spoke to the appellant several times a  day
    and with the  documentary  evidence  from  his  village  regarding  his
    circumstances there. I consider that  the judge  should have considered
     that evidence in  detail,  no  doubt  after  the  application  of  the
    principles in Tanveeer Ahmed  to the documentary evidence and then made
    findings of fact  with regard to the  exercise of  family  life  before
    and after the  appellant's parents came to Britain. I consider that  it
    was an error of law not to carry out  that exercise and  make  findings
    thereon.

25.  I therefore set aside the determination of the  First-tier  judge   and
    direct that the  appeal proceed to a  hearing  afresh.  The  issues  to
    which I  have referred above  should be addressed and  I would add that
     a finding on financial dependency should also be made as I cannot find
    that that was an issue which was conceded by the ECO or the  Presenting
    Officer - there should  be  a  finding  on  why  the  appellant  cannot
    support himself.

Notice of Decision

  The appeal is remitted to the First-tier tribunal for a hearing afresh  on
all issues.
