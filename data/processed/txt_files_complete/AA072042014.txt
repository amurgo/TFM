                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, AAS, date of birth 22.170, is a citizen of Libya.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Smith promulgated 15.12.14, dismissing his appeal against the  decision
    of the  Secretary  of  State,  dated  4.9.14,  to  refuse  his  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and human rights claims.  The Judge  heard  the
    appeal on 28.11.14.

 3. Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Zucker  granted  permission  to
    appeal on 13.1.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 18.12.15 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out below, I find no error of law in the making  of
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as to require the decision
    of Judge Smith to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background of the  claim  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The appellant claims that he worked in an  executive  position
    for a humanitarian charity in Tripoli. It is asserted that a brigade or
    armed militia took over a building adjacent to the appellant  and  they
    prevented the charity from operating and raided the building from which
    it operated.  He  complained  to  the  police  and  also  reported  the
    situation to the Interior Ministry, but a few days later  the  building
    was raided again and he was forced to flee Tripoli, believing that  the
    brigade intended to arrest him. His  home  was  also  raided  and  they
    searched for him at his father's home.  He  obtained  documentation  to
    travel to the UK and returned to Tripoli to collect this  documentation
    before leaving via Tunisia and then Frankfurt. He claims that he cannot
    return to Libya because of the threats made by the brigade and that  he
    thus has a fear of  persecution  on  the  basis  of  imputed  political
    opinion.

 7. In essence, the appellant's case turned on his credibility. Judge Smith
    found the appellant's account not credible, for  the  reasons  set  out
    from �24 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

 8. From �5 the grounds set out a number of complaints about  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal,  asserting  that  the  judge  made  factual
    errors and adverse findings without  adequate  reasoning.  It  is  also
    submitted that the judge misdirected himself as the risk on  return  on
    the basis of AT and Others  (Article  15C  risk  categories)  Libya  CG
    [2014] UKUT.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Zucker noted that  the  grounds
    include the submission that the Judge erred in conflating two events in
    making an adverse credibility finding and in reliance upon  a  Tunisian
    stamp in the appellant's passport erred in making the finding that  the
    appellant passed through Libyan immigration control.

10. I am satisfied that there is no merit in the first ground of appeal  as
    to conflation of two separate incidents. Consideration of  �27  of  the
    decision and the evidence reveals no  such  conflation,  but  as  Judge
    Smith described it, a "material discrepancy." In fact, the judge  found
    in the appellant's favour in relation  the  refusal  decision  on  this
    point. The Secretary of State had suggested at �15-16  of  the  refusal
    decision that the appellant gave an inconsistent account with regard to
    having attempted to reason with brigade members. It was suggested  that
    he claimed to have attempted to reason with the brigade  but  this  was
    inconsistent with his account that even the police were scared  of  the
    brigade and it was not credible that he would put himself in danger  by
    doing so. However, the judge was satisfied that at Q70  of  the  asylum
    interview the appellant was referring to visiting  headquarters,  where
    he sat down with the legal advisor, who warned him about the  brigades.
    The  judge  was  satisfied  that  he  was  referring  to  visiting  the
    authorities to complain about the actions of the brigade  and  was  not
    there suggesting that he had  attempted  to  reason  with  the  brigade
    directly.

11. However, the  judge  went  on  to  point  out  that  in  his  'rebuttal
    statement' the appellant pointedly and clearly stated that he had never
    approached the brigade to try and reason with them, suggesting that had
    he done so he would definitely  have  been  murdered.  Then  the  judge
    referred to further answers in interview from  Q74  onwards  where  the
    appellant was clearly confirming that he had tried to reason  with  the
    brigade, only to be accused of collaborating with the  old  regime  and
    they put guns to his neck. This is a clear inconsistency and it is this
    inconsistency the  judge  was  entitled  to  rely  on.  The  judge  was
    satisfied that at the time of his interview the appellant was trying to
    suggest he had directly approached the brigade and by implication  that
    is why he was subsequently targeted. The judge was  satisfied  that  he
    had changed his account by the time of his witness statement  and  thus
    rightly considered this a material discrepancy.  No  error  of  law  is
    disclosed in this regard and there  is  no  merit  in  this  ground  of
    appeal.

12. Complaint is made in �6 of the grounds that at �28 of the decision  the
    judge found that a letter relied on by the appellant, which  he  claims
    was sent to the Ministry of the Interior, dated 26.11.13, detailing the
    problems the charity was having, being harassed by the brigade. At  �28
    Judge Smith simply stated that even if  this  letter  is  genuine,  and
    there is reason given in the refusal decision to  think  otherwise,  it
    does nothing to explain why the appellant personally would be targeted,
    as he is not named in the letter and  is  not  a  signatory.  In  other
    words, the letter does not materially advance the appellant's  case  to
    be personally at risk on  return.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  judge's
    comment is fair and reasoned and made in  the  light  of  the  evidence
    taken as a whole. There is no merit in this ground of appeal.

13. Ms Khan did not concede the suggestion of Mr McVeety that the ground of
    appeal set out at �7 is nonsense, but she did not pursue  it  with  any
    vigor. At �31 the judge had  pointed  out  that  the  appellant  has  a
    Tunisian border stamp in his passport, showing that he went through  an
    official border checkpoint when exiting Libya and entering Tunisia.  In
    his interview he claimed that  he  crossed  the  border  without  going
    through any checkpoints, trying to  suggest  he  did  not  leave  Libya
    legally because of the threat to his life. Judge Smith was satisfied on
    the basis of the Tunisian stamp that he  must  have  passed  through  a
    border checkpoint and thus could  not  have  left  Libya  illegally  as
    claimed.  This   point   significantly   undermined   the   appellant's
    credibility. The grounds suggest that  although  there  is  a  Tunisian
    entry stamp this did not mean he had exited Libya through  an  official
    checkpoint. This is plain nonsense and discloses no error of law. It is
    not surprising that Ms Khan did not actively pursue this ground.

14. I find no error of law in  the  judge's  reliance  as  undermining  his
    credibility the fact that the appellant allegedly in such fear  of  the
    brigade that he felt forced to flee Tripoli and in due course Libya, he
    nevertheless returned to Tripoli to collect travel  documents.  At  �32
    the judge pointed out the appellant remained in Libya between  November
    2013 and April 2014, and during that period returned twice  to  Tripoli
    to lodge his visa application and return to  collect  it,  all  without
    problems. He had the necessary travel documents some 2 months before he
    eventually left. The judge considered but rejected the suggestion  that
    the delay was attributed to  his  fear  of  being  apprehended  at  the
    airport. The judge  was  entitled  to  consider  but  then  reject  the
    explanation  offered,  especially  when  considered  with   the   other
    credibility findings and to consider as undermining of that credibility
    that he twice returned to an area claimed to be a danger to  his  life.
    There is no merit in this ground of appeal.

15. The ground of appeal at �9 has no practical force, since it deals  with
    the hypothetical risk on return of the appellant even  if  his  account
    were to be considered credible. The ground is developed further at  �10
    to suggest that the judge was incorrect to follow AT and that he failed
    to engage with the background material.

16. However, the background material was quite  limited,  at  issue  was  a
    UNHCR position paper, but the judge was  supplied  with  only  a  short
    press release about this position paper, as he pointed out at  �10.  It
    is not for the judge to hunt out the evidence. Ms Khan did not have the
    appellant's supplementary bundle containing  this  position  paper  and
    other similar but limited press releases and was  not  aware  that  the
    full position paper had not been supplied. Ms Khan did  submit  however
    that  the  background  evidence  suggested  that  the   situation   had
    deteriorated further since AT was decided  on  14.7.14,  based  on  the
    circumstances prevailing as of 22.11.13. It is submitted that the judge
    failed to properly engage with the background material.

17. Mr McVeety pointed out that it is common  case  authority  that  before
    departing from a country guidance case  a  judge  must  have  good  and
    cogent  evidence   to   demonstrate   that   the   circumstances   were
    significantly  different  to  when  a  country  guidance  decision  was
    promulgated. More  significantly,  Mr  McVeety  pointed  out  that  the
    appellant's own  expert,  Dr  George,  at  �77  of  his  report,  dated
    24.10.14, was of the opinion that although the appellant  would  be  at
    risk of imminent violence, this risk was not high.  At  �84  Dr  George
    also stated that it was not clear to him that the militia that he fears
    would be sufficiently motivated against him  to  expend  resources  and
    time pursuing him across the country. "In  my  opinion  they  would  be
    unlikely to consider his 'offences' to have  been  grave,"  whilst  not
    ruling this out. In the light of these opinions  from  the  appellant's
    own expert, and the paucity of the claimed background material, I  find
    no error of law in the judge's reliance on AT. The judge considered the
    submission that the situation had deteriorated further  since  AT,  but
    explains with cogent reasons why he was satisfied that return to  Libya
    would not breach the UK's Article 15C responsibility.

18. In the circumstances, the grounds are weak  and  disclose  no  material
    error of law in the decision and reasoning of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge.

Conclusions:

19. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. Given the circumstances, I am anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
