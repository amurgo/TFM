Representation:

For the Appellants:    Unrepresented
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer

Anonymity:

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise, the appellants are
granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
indirectly identify them. This direction applies both to the appellants and
to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead to
contempt of court proceedings.




                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens of Ghana born in March 1998, April 1998 and
    June 2000 who applied for entry clearance to the UK. The appellants
    claim to be the children (either biological or adopted) of the Sponsor.



 2. On 30 January 2016 the Secretary of State refused the application for
    entry clearance. The appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    where their appeal was heard by Judge Black. In a decision promulgated
    on 3 July 2017, the appeal was dismissed. The appellants are now
    appealing against that decision.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal found that the appellants were unable to
    satisfy the requirements of the Immigration Rules and considered the
    appeal outside the Rules under Article 8 ECHR.

 4. In the course of assessing the position under Article 8 ECHR, the judge
    made the following findings:

 a) At paragraph 23 the judge stated that the second and third appellants
    are the biological children of the Sponsor and their mother JM.

 b) At paragraph 24 the judge found that JM died in February 2000, stating:

         "I accept [JM] has died and that she is the mother of the second
             appellant (as mentioned in this declaration). It is not clear
             why there is no mention of the third appellant in this
             declaration, given that it is claimed that she is also the
             daughter of [JM]."

 5. At paragraph 40 the judge stated:

    "The appellants have a limited family life with the Sponsor who visits
         them occasionally in their own country. They have contact with
         their mother and she is their primary carer. They continue to do so
         notwithstanding the refusals."

 6. At the error of law hearing, I asked Mr Kandola if he was able to
    reconcile the apparent contradiction between the judge's finding at
    paragraph 24 that JM had died and his finding at paragraph 40 that the
    appellants have contact with their mother. Mr Kandola acknowledged that
    these findings were irreconcilable but argued that it must be that at
    paragraph 40 the judge was only referring to the first appellant.

 7. I am unable to reconcile the contradiction between the aforementioned
    findings in the decision. The judge made a clear finding that the
    second appellant's mother is deceased. However, when evaluating the
    proportionality of refusing entry clearance to the appellants the judge
    stated that they (without distinguishing between the appellants) have
    contact with their mother who is their primary carer. This
    contradiction in the judge's findings pertains to a factual issue which
    is central to the appeal and as such constitutes a material error of
    law.

 8. Remaking the decision will require the factual circumstances to be
    considered afresh. Given the extent of further fact-finding this will
    entail, the appeal should be remitted to the First-tier tribunal to be
    heard before a different judge.

Notice of Decision

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a material error of
    law and is set aside.

10. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be heard afresh
    before a different judge.
