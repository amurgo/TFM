For the Appellant:     Ms J Heybroek and Ms B Jones (counsel)
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker (Home Office Senior Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appeals of [SH], a citizen of Nigeria  born  25  December
    1987, and her son [AE] (born 25 June 2012), against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal of  24  November  2017,  dismissing  their  appeals
    against the decision of the Secretary of State to  refuse  their  human
    rights claims. I shall refer to the First Appellant as "the  Appellant"
    for convenience.

 2. Central to the entitlement of the First Appellant to remain in  the  UK
    are the connections and status of her two children,  [AE]  (the  Second
    Appellant) and [KD] (born 4 May 2014),  her  two  sons  from  different
    fathers. [AE] was the son of [SI] and was a Nigerian citizen; [KD]  has
    consistent been said to be the son of [NA], a British citizen (and thus
    British himself), though until the continuation hearing before me  this
    critical aspect of the family's case was disputed.

Error of law hearing

 3. The immigration history supplied by the Respondent notes that there was
    no corroborative evidence to support [SH]'s asserted arrival date;  she
    first came to light in February 2009 when she made  an  application  as
    the partner of an EEA national, though this was subsequently  withdrawn
    due to a change in her circumstances. She applied  for  leave  on  long
    residence grounds in May 2010, an application which was  refused  on  2
    September 2010 and again on 22 March 2011 following a reconsideration.

 4. She applied for leave on  human  rights  grounds  on  6  May  2011,  an
    application she pursued on 21 August 2012, before it was refused on  25
    September 2012. None of the refusals so far bore  a  right  of  appeal.
    Various Pre Action Protocol letters from  May  2013  to  November  2014
    sought a reconsideration of the September 2012 refusal. On 25  November
    2014 the Secretary of State sought an update of her circumstances.  She
    made a further application on human rights grounds on 5  December  2014
    on behalf of herself and the  children.  Further  Pre  Action  Protocol
    letters pursued this application's progress.

 5. The Secretary of State enquired as  to  whether  she  wished  to  claim
    asylum or to be referred to the National Referral  Mechanism,  but  she
    declined. Having learned of the claimed British  citizenship  of  [KD],
    she was invited to supply evidence of his parentage via  DNA  evidence,
    but she informed the Respondent that he had been uncooperative.

 6. [KD] had been issued with a British passport by the Passport Office  on
    24 July 2014. The application had provided  certified  copies  of  this
    document, but the  original  was  ultimately  sent  to  the  Presenting
    Officers' Unit prior to the original 17 May 2017 hearing, but then  not
    produced thereafter; it transpired that the passport had been lost,  as
    was eventually admitted by the Respondent at the adjourned hearing on 9
    November 2017.

 7. The First-tier Tribunal summarised the First Appellant's  human  rights
    claim thus. [SH] had been brought to the UK in 1998, aged eleven, by  a
    woman from her home village, described as the "village  aunt",  on  the
    pretext that she was going to meet her sick grandmother.  However  once
    she arrived here she was used as a  childminder  for  the  woman's  own
    children. She was abandoned when the family moved  out  and  forced  to
    seek the local church's support, who placed her the care of a  Nigerian
    couple, the [O]s, with whom she lived until reaching adulthood. She had
    nothing to return to in Nigeria having left the country some  18  years
    earlier and that all her ties were in the UK.

 8. Their applications were eventually refused on 4 February 2016 because

      a) It was not accepted that [KD] was a  British  citizen:  accordingly
         both children fell to be considered as  relatively  young  Nigerian
         nationals with limited ties to the UK given their tender  age,  and
         there was no reason to think that adequate  educational  facilities
         would not be available to them;

      b) There was no evidence proving [SH]'s UK residence  prior  to  2002,
         when she was issued with a NHS Medical Card;

      c) Any private life [SH] had established in the UK was on a precarious
         footing given her lack of immigration status;

      d) There was no evidence to confirm that the [O]s had raised her as  a
         daughter.

 9. The First-tier Tribunal heard oral evidence and made findings  of  fact
    upon it, concluding that it was difficult to place much weight  on  the
    First Appellant's word alone. Particular emphasis was placed  on  these
    factors:

      a) There was a significant discrepancy  in  the  evidence  as  to  the
         circumstances of [KD]'s birth as to when [NA] was contacted: Mr [O]
         stated this was before they left for the hospital, whilst the First
         Appellant had said she rang the father in the morning.

      b) Whilst [KD] held a British passport, it appeared to have been  lost
         having been sent to the Home Office, and given the doubts raised as
         to his paternity by the Respondent, it  was  necessary  to  make  a
         finding  as  to  his  nationality   based   on   the   balance   of
         probabilities:  there  were   discrepancies   between   the   birth
         certificate (stating he was a bus driver) and Mr [O]'s evidence  as
         to his occupation (saying he  was  a  security  officer),  and  the
         circumstances of  his  disappearance  were  surprising,  given  his
         original willingness to have his details on the birth  certificate;
         no further steps had been  taken  to  trace  him,  for  example  by
         seeking maintenance from him. In these circumstances the mere  fact
         that  the  Passport  Office  had  accepted  [KD]  as  British   was
         insufficient. Whilst it was possible that [NA] was his father, this
         was  not  established  to  the   standard   of   the   balance   of
         probabilities.

10. There were some matters as to which the First-tier Tribunal  considered
    it impossible to make findings of fact:

      a) There was no independent evidence of  the  circumstances  in  which
         [SH] was brought to the UK: no finding was possible as  to  whether
         false pretences were used, no asylum or  trafficking  claim  having
         been brought;

      b) The date of her arrival here could not be placed beyond 2002,  when
         the Secretary of State accepted  that  she  might  well  have  been
         present, and as was consistent  with  the  evidence  that  she  had
         attended school in Walthamstow  at  that  time;  the  inconsistency
         mentioned regarding the circumstances of  [KD]'s  birth  was  again
         troubling.

11. Determining the appeal based on these findings, the First-tier Tribunal
    concluded that the children were well cared for by their mother.  There
    was no information regarding [AE]'s well-being, but there was no reason
    to believe he was not thriving in the care and devotion of  his  mother
    and surrogate grandparents, and  no  evidence  that  either  child  was
    developing other than normally. Having regard  to  the  EV  Philippines
    factors, the children were healthy and without independent roots in the
    community that might be expected during teenage years, and Nigeria  was
    the country of their heritage with which the [O]s retained strong links
    and where their mother was born and raised; they had  been  brought  up
    within  the  Nigerian  diaspora.  In  the  circumstances  it  was   not
    unreasonable for the children to return to Nigeria.

12. Even if [KD] was a British citizen, he had no contact with  his  father
    and it was reasonable to expect that  he  be  raised  by  his  Nigerian
    mother with his half-sibling.

13. Grounds of appeal contended that

      a) It was not open to the Secretary of State to go behind the issue of
         a British passport to [KD], particularly given  her  responsibility
         for its subsequent disappearance;

      b) The discrepancy on which so much weight was placed as to the timing
         of the notification of [KD]'s birth to the father was predicated on
         an error of fact: Mr [O] had in fact said  he  had  not  been  sure
         whether the father had been present in the labour suite as  he  had
         left the hospital at times during the night:   this  was  a  highly
         material error given it was central  to  the  adjudication  of  the
         Appellants' case on paternity and thus nationality;

      c) The First-tier Tribunal had found that there was  an  inconsistency
         in the evidence of [KD]'s father involvement  in  his  son's  life,
         i.e. between what the Judge perceived as his  original  anxiety  to
         get his name on the birth  certificate  and  to  obtain  a  British
         passport  for  his  son,  as   contrasted   with   his   subsequent
         disappearance. However this failed to take account of the  evidence
         that father and son had an extant relationship for a  brief  period
         following his birth and that the father  only  subsequently  became
         disinterested  once  financial  support  was  sought,  and  it  was
         perverse to fail  to  consider  that  parental  responsibility  may
         fluctuate over time - furthermore, the possibility  that  he  might
         have been traced via the assistance of  the  child  support  agency
         pursuant to an application for child maintenance  against  him  had
         not been raised at the hearing.

14. Permission to appeal was granted  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  11
    January 2018 on the basis that it was arguable  that  the  issue  of  a
    passport by the relevant  domestic  authority  had  established  [KD]'s
    citizenship.

Error of law hearing - Findings and reasons

15. At the start of the "error of law" hearing I indicated that to my mind,
    without having heard submissions but expressing a preliminary view, the
    grounds of appeal were made out. If the Passport Office  has  issued  a
    person with a passport, that recognises that they have a  viable  claim
    to British citizenship. Whilst that does not  necessarily  prevent  the
    matter being re-visited in  the  future,  it  seemed  to  me  that  the
    Secretary of State must establish some relevant change of circumstances
    based on cogent objective evidence before so doing.

16. Mr Walker accepted that the First-tier Tribunal had been wrong to treat
    the Appellants as bearing the burden of proof  in  establishing  [KD]'s
    nationality. He pointed out that the decision  was  also  confusing  in
    that there was no  clear-cut  concluded  finding  on  the  question  of
    nationality,  which  at  one  point  was  said  to  be   incapable   of
    determination. Ms Breybroek agreed.

17. I concluded that the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  could  not  stand,
    being fatally flawed by virtue of these material errors of law.

18. Firstly, it was an error of law to place the burden  of  proof  on  the
    Appellants to establish [KD]'s nationality  notwithstanding  the  prior
    issue of a British passport to him.   Where  the  relevant  authorities
    have already taken a decision  recognising  a  particular  entitlement,
    cogent reasons are required  before  a  related  government  department
    comes to a different conclusion, see for example

      a) Burnett J in Ali [2012] EWHC 3379 (Admin) �23:

         "... having once been satisfied that an individual was entitled  to
         a passport, the Secretary of State would  need  to  advance  cogent
         reasons that stood up to scrutiny why, on a later application,  she
         was taking a different view."

      b)  Edis J in Rahman [2015] EWHC 1146 (Admin) �31:

         "... for obviously sensible reasons, it requires cogent reasons  to
         justify the refusal to renew a passport on the application  of  the
         person  to  whom  the  original  passport  was  issued   after   an
         investigation."

19. Secondly, the First-tier Tribunal failed to make a clear finding on the
    central issue of [KD]'s nationality in any event.

20. Thirdly, as noted above, the Judge below declined to make  a  concluded
    finding on the length of [SH]'s residence, essentially because  of  its
    perception that she lacked the right  kind  of  documents  to  reliably
    corroborate her stay in the UK. However, this approach is  inconsistent
    with relevant authority, for as stated by Beatson  LJ  in  Khan  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 416 �61 in an analogous context:

         "First, as Mr Lewis accepted, there is  no  authority  for  such  a
         restriction in legislation or the Immigration Rules.  Secondly,  as
         recognised, for example in ZH (Bangladesh) v Secretary of State for
         the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 8 at [3], the 14 year rule  set
         out in Rule 276B(i)(b) is specifically directed to people who  have
         managed to stay in the United Kingdom for 14 years or more  without
         lawful authority, and is in effect an amnesty clause. It is  likely
         that those in the  United  Kingdom  without  leave,  and  therefore
         without status, will have no official  documentation,  particularly
         in the early period of their residence. Thirdly, although  most  of
         the documents listed by the Secretary of State can be classified as
         "official" in the sense that they are  from  institutions  and  not
         individuals, a tenancy agreement and  a  letter  from  a  landlord,
         which are listed, are difficult to classify as 'official'."

21. Finally, in determining the appeal on the alternative basis  that  [KD]
    was a British citizen, the First-tier Tribunal failed to  take  account
    of its own findings that he had  lived  with  (and  must  therefore  be
    presumed to have a significant relationship with) the  [O]s,  whom  the
    First-tier Tribunal styled as his "surrogate grandparents",  which  was
    clearly relevant when determining his best interests and whether  there
    were powerful reasons to justify thinking his departure reasonable.

22. As my "error of law" decision made clear, whilst the appeal had  become
    relatively complex in law, the fact-finding required  to  complete  its
    determination was foreseeably  limited.  Thus  it  was  appropriate  to
    retain the appeal for a continuation hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

Continuation hearing

23. Re-determining the appeal, it is appropriate to have regard  to  rather
    more of the evidence that was available than was necessary hitherto.

24. In her witness statement the Appellant set out the circumstances of her
    arrival in the UK. Her parents passed away when she was young  and  she
    was raised by her grandmother.  She  was  brought  here  by  a  village
    "aunty" and she did not know what visa was obtained for her.  Following
    her arrival in the UK she was required to stay with that  "aunty",  her
    husband and their three children. The children were then aged five  and
    seven, and one was a young baby. She  was  forced  to  look  after  the
    children and deprived of social interaction and made  to  do  household
    chores, like laundry, cooking, and ironing,  and  was  treated  like  a
    maid. She missed school and the chance of making friends.  Her  "aunty"
    maintained a story that her grandmother was very  sick  and  unable  to
    talk to her; eventually she was told that her  grandmother  had  passed
    away. Some time afterwards she was told that the family was moving  and
    that she could not accompany them. They  promised  to  return  for  her
    subsequently. They left some food and coins for her  support.  However,
    they never returned. After a month the means of support they  had  left
    her ran out. She asked a neighbour for help, and was quickly forced  to
    beg on the street.

25. Senior Apostle [D], Minister in  charge  of  the  St  Mary  in  Hackney
    church, wrote a letter stating that he first met the Appellant in  1998
    at the church.  Some  time  later,  a  family  that  was  part  of  the
    congregation told him of her difficult circumstances, having arrived in
    the UK and been forced to flee from her guardian here. The  church  had
    put in place temporary care arrangements pending  her  introduction  to
    the [O]s.

26. Mr [O] wrote a letter on behalf of himself and  his  wife  setting  out
    that they first met the Appellant at  St  Mary  Church  in  Hackney  in
    Autumn 2001. They learned of her troubling past from the Minister there
    who explained that he was unable to care for her. They had  been  moved
    by her story and decided to take her in, not least  because  they  were
    impressed by the enquiry that the church was conducting  via  community
    leaders in her home area. They arranged for her to start school at    [
    ~ ]. She left home suddenly in 2003; they subsequently learned from the
    Minister that did not wish to return to their home.

27. The Appellant's friend [SC] wrote a letter setting out that she came to
    know the [S] (who I understand to be the "aunty" and her husband),  who
    then lived at [ ~ ] North London, from 1997. She knew [SH] from  around
    that time. Some time later [SH] got in touch, devastated to  have  been
    abandoned by her guardian who had travelled on her own, and hoping that
    [SC] would look after her. [SC] had been unable to do so, having  three
    boys to care for at the time, but eventually introduced her  to  Pastor
    [D] at the St Mary in Hackney church.

28. At the outset of the continuation hearing,  the  relevant  issues  were
    agreed by the parties. The Appellant potentially had three  avenues  to
    success  under  the  Immigration  Rules:  the  20-year  long   unlawful
    residence route, the reasonableness  of  her  British  citizen  child's
    relocation  to  Nigeria,  and  the  very   significant   obstacles   to
    integration that she would face there given the length of  her  absence
    abroad.

29. Further evidence was adduced as follows:

      a) From the Appellant, a short proforma record  of  an  assessment  of
         [AE]'s  well-being  as  at  February  2018  from  the  Social   and
         Communication Clinic at the local NHS  Trust,  which  recorded  the
         family's concerns about [AE], noting that the family  had  reported
         him as scratching himself; he had been diagnosed as  being  on  the
         Autistic Spectrum Disorder, and that he had anger issues;

      b) Mr Walker provided a disclosure response from HM  Passport  Office.
         He confirmed that in the light of the  acceptance  therein  of  the
         British citizen father's relationship with his son,  the  Secretary
         of State accepted that the Appellant was a British citizen,  having
         been born in the UK to a British citizen father.

30. The Appellant gave evidence. Social services were  presently  assisting
    her and had consistently found her  accommodation.  [AE]'s  school  had
    helped to access the Social  and  Communication  Clinic  regarding  his
    behaviour concerns. She only  had  faint  memories  of  life  when  she
    arrived in the UK as it was so long ago. She remembered  her  age  when
    she came, she was around eleven. She remembered the excitement  of  her
    arrival at a new place to live with her relatives. She had been  living
    in the UK for very many years.

31. Cross examined she said that she remembered being put into school at  [
    ~ ] in Walthamstow some time after her arrival in the UK: her  guardian
    had come to realise that it was unlawful for her not to attend  school.
    This was about four years after her arrival. Before then, she had  been
    required to look after the children constantly. She  had  not  had  any
    contact with [KD]'s father since the boy was aged around one,  and  she
    knew nothing of his present circumstances.

32. Mr Walker relied on the refusal letter. He confirmed that in the  light
    of the further information from the Passport Office there was no reason
    to question [KD]'s entitlement  to  British  citizenship.  He  accepted
    there was now corroborative evidence of  residence  in  the  UK  for  a
    longer period  than  the  Secretary  of  State  had  accepted.  It  was
    undeniable that the Appellant had very  strong  ties  in  this  country
    given she had lived for much of her life here.

33. Ms Jones provided a skeleton argument in which she usefully set out the
    relevant legal framework and pointed to the salient evidence supporting
    the Appellants' claims.  Orally  she  submitted  that  the  Appellant's
    evidence was generally credible, detailed and plausible, and  the  lack
    of detail she could provide about her early years in the  UK  when  she
    was forced to care for her extended family's young children. Given  the
    ties that she had inevitably established  here  over  the  last  twenty
    years, and those of the two children including a British citizen child,
    the family's relocation would be unreasonable. In any event  she  would
    clearly face very significant obstacles to integration back in Nigeria.



Continuation hearing - Findings and reasons

34. I was impressed by [SH]'s oral evidence. She  gave  the  impression  of
    seeking to answer the questions put to her as honestly as possible. Her
    answers were consistent with the documentary evidence and plausible  in
    the general context of her narrative. Her account's  veracity  was  not
    challenged  by  Mr  Walker  in  cross   examination   or   submissions,
    understandably given its general cogency. I accordingly accept that the
    history she advances is a credible one.

35. In the light of my general impression of her  evidence,  I  accept  her
    assertion to have  first  arrived  in  the  UK  in  1998  and  to  have
    subsequently resided here for 20  years.  It  is  corroborated  by  the
    letters from a Minister, who states he has known her from around  1998,
    as well as by the evidence of [SC].  Her  evidence  is  also  generally
    supported by that from Mr and Mrs [O].

36. It is also clear that she has sole parental  responsibility  for  [KD],
    who is now  established  as  a  British  citizen  child.  [KD]'s  birth
    certificate records his full name as [KD], that his father was [NA] and
    his mother was [SH]. The Appellant has no contact with his father,  and
    has had no contact with the father since [KD]'s first year.

37. I also accept that  [AE]  is  a  somewhat  troubled  child,  given  the
    evidence from the Social and Communication Clinic. This is unsurprising
    given the difficult conditions in which the Appellant and her two young
    children have lived.

38. I proceed to remind  myself  of  the  relevant  legal  framework.   The
    Immigration Rules provide:

         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on  the
         grounds of private life

         276ADE. The requirements to be met by an  applicant  for  leave  to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
         date of application, the applicant: ...

             (vi)      is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in
             the UK for less than  20  years  (discounting  any  period  of
             imprisonment) but there would be very significant obstacles to
             the applicant's integration into the country to which he would
             have to go if required to leave the UK"

39. Sales LJ in Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 explained that  the  concept  of
    integration

         "... is not confined to the mere  ability  to  find  a  job  or  to
         sustain  life  while  living  in  the  other  country.  It  is  not
         appropriate to treat the statutory  language  as  subject  to  some
         gloss and it will usually be sufficient for  a  court  or  tribunal
         simply to direct itself in the terms that Parliament has chosen  to
         use. The  idea  of  "integration"  calls  for  a  broad  evaluative
         judgment to be made as to whether the individual will be enough  of
         an insider in terms of understanding how life  in  the  society  in
         that other country is carried on and a capacity to  participate  in
         it, so as to have a reasonable opportunity to be accepted there, to
         be able to operate on a day-to-day basis in  that  society  and  to
         build up within a reasonable time a variety of human  relationships
         to give substance to the individual's private or family life."

40. It is first appropriate to assess the Appellant's by reference to those
    Rules. It seems to me that this is a case where  she  would  face  very
    significant obstacles to integration back in Nigeria. She has not lived
    there for over 20 years. It is inconceivable that she  could  have  any
    useful memory of  her  life  there  to  draw  upon  now,  and  I  place
    particular weight on the fact that the church conducted enquiries  into
    her original circumstances abroad before making  arrangements  for  her
    care in the UK. This to my mind corroborates her  story  to  have  been
    effectively abandoned to her fate in the UK by any family  members  who
    were then responsible for her. If that was their attitude  two  decades
    ago, it is unlikely to have changed subsequently.

41. It may well be true that the Appellant has lived  within  the  Nigerian
    diaspora to a significant degree thereafter.  Certainly  she  has  been
    supported by a church where it seems  reasonable  to  assume  that  the
    congregation has strong connections  there.  But  those  are  the  very
    connections which were unable to locate family to look after  her  when
    she was a vulnerable child. I do not consider that she would  have  any
    meaningful social capital to draw upon, and she  would  be  responsible
    for the welfare of two young  children,  for  whom  she  would  face  a
    difficult choice between finding childcare  without  social  or  family
    support whilst she worked, or having no  living  by  which  to  support
    them. It seems to me that she would accordingly face  very  significant
    obstacles to integration in the Kamara sense.

42. Accordingly her appeal succeeds  under  the  Immigration  Rules.  Self-
    evidently the same thinking applies to young [AE], who would  certainly
    not be better off than his mother when it comes to integration abroad.

43. For completeness, I also address private and family  life  outside  the
    Rules. The Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  provides  that
    certain considerations must be considered in immigration appeals  where
    private and family life is in play.

         "PART 5A

         Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations ...

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
             the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)       Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious.

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
             the public interest does  not  require  the  person's  removal
             where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

44. As was stated in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11:

         "Cases are not ... to be approached by searching for  a  unique  or
         unusual feature, and  in  its  absence  rejecting  the  application
         without further examination. Rather, as the  Master  of  the  Rolls
         made clear, the test is one of proportionality.  The  reference  to
         exceptional circumstances in the European case law means  that,  in
         cases involving precarious family life, "something very  compelling
         ... is required  to  outweigh  the  public  interest",  applying  a
         proportionality test."

45. When assessing reasonableness in the context of section 117B(6),  Elias
    LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA  Civ  705  explained  that  that  wider
    public interest considerations  had  to  be  taken  into  account  when
    assessing the reasonableness of a child's relocation, beyond  its  best
    interests. The fact that a child has been here for seven years must  be
    given significant weight when carrying out the proportionality exercise
    as was shown by the Secretary of State's published guidance from August
    2015 in which it  is  expressly  stated  that  once  the  seven  years'
    residence requirement is satisfied, there need to be  "strong  reasons"
    for refusing leave, because after such a period of time the child  will
    have put down roots and  developed  social,  cultural  and  educational
    links in the UK such that it is likely to be highly disruptive  if  the
    child is required to leave the UK.  Nevertheless, it may be  reasonable
    to require the child to leave where there are good cogent reasons, even
    if they are not compelling.

46. The Secretary of State has published a  policy  document,  Every  Child
    Matters - Change for Children, as statutory guidance to the  UK  Border
    Agency on making arrangements to safeguard and promote the  welfare  of
    children, which refers to the definition of this task found in  section
    11 of the Children Act 2004 and in the policy guidance Working Together
    to Safeguard Children, as "ensuring that children  are  growing  up  in
    circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care;
    and undertaking that role so  as  to  enable  those  children  to  have
    optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully."

47. I accept that the children would face real hardship if  they  relocated
    abroad  with  their  mother  for  the  self-evident   reasons   already
    identified above.  In  any  event,  the  departure  of  [KD]  would  be
    unreasonable, and contrary to the statutory  guidance  to  promote  his
    optimum life chances. Nothing could do so less than sending  him  to  a
    country where he has never lived and where the  advantages  of  British
    citizenship would be largely lost to him, dependent as he would be on a
    mother  whose  scarce  social  capital  would  make  daily  life   very
    difficult. There is also the matter of [AE]'s UK connections,  and  his
    vulnerability  as  shown  by  the  intervention  by  the   Social   and
    Communication Clinic cited above.

48. Furthermore, there is the question of the mother's long residence here.
    Whilst she had not accumulated 20 years of residence in the  UK  before
    making the application (meaning she does not satisfy Rule 276ADE(iii)),
    she has nevertheless done so by the date of hearing before me. The fact
    that the Immigration Rules have identified two decades of UK  residence
    as a significant milestone is relevant when determining the strength of
    her own private life here. The reality is that  she  knows  nothing  of
    life in Nigeria, and has lived for most of that part of her life  which
    she can reasonably be expected to remember in the UK - from around  the
    age of eleven  until  her  early  thirties.  All  her  connections  and
    friendships are here.

49. I accordingly find that the family's departure to Nigeria  would  be  a
    disproportionate  interference  with  their  private  and  family  life
    rights, both within and outside the Immigration Rules.

    Decision:

    The appeals are allowed on Human Rights Convention grounds.
