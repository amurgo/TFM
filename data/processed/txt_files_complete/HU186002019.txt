Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Nnamani, instructed by Chris Alexander Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Nigerian national who was born on 9 August 1958.  He
    appeals, with permission granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Ford,
    against a decision which was issued by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Chana
    ("the judge") on 6 March 2020.  By her decision,  the  judge  dismissed
    the appellant's appeal against the respondent's refusal  of  his  human
    rights claim.

Background

 2. The appellant claims to have entered the United Kingdom  in  1996.   He
    made no attempt to regularise his status until 2010.  On  11  May  that
    year, he made an application for leave to  remain  in  reliance  (as  I
    understand it) on paragraph 276B of  the  Immigration  Rules.   He  was
    required, under that paragraph as it then stood, to establish  that  he
    had been in the UK for 14 years or more.  He did not establish that  to
    the satisfaction of the respondent.  His claim was accordingly refused.
     There was no right of appeal.


 3. The appellant remained in the United Kingdom and on 9 October 2015,  he
    made a further application for leave to  remain,  in  reliance  on  his
    rights under Article 8 ECHR.  His application was refused but an appeal
    was allowed on Article 8  ECHR  grounds  on  14  January  2017.   (This
    decision has not been adduced before me, nor was it  before  the  FtT).
    He was granted leave to remain which was valid from 31 March 2017 to 30
    September 2019.

 4. Before the expiry of his leave, the appellant made an  application  for
    further leave on the basis of his private and family life in the United
    Kingdom.  In his application, he stated that he wished to remain in the
    UK so that he could continue his relationship with his  son,  "L",  who
    was born in London on 16 February 2007.  The appellant stated  that  he
    had lived with L and his mother until his  relationship  with  her  had
    broken down in 2018.  From that point, the appellant stated that he had
    remained in regular contact with his  son.   He  stated  that  he  also
    bought things for L and that he also provided L's mother with money for
    his upkeep.

 5. On 23 October 2019, the respondent wrote to the appellant's  solicitors
    to request further evidence in support of the application.  Attached to
    the email was a list of the 'missing  relevant  information'.   In  the
    event that the appellant was unable to  provide  the  missing  relevant
    information, the email from the respondent stated that  an  explanation
    was to be provided.  The list was as follows


     1) If your client does not reside with his child then  please  provide
        documentary evidence, dated within the last 6  months,  to  confirm
        that he has contact with his child.  This  should  be  on  official
        headed paper and  be  from  the  child's  school,  nursery,  health
        visitor, GP or local authority.  The  letter  should  confirm  what
        contact he has  with  this  child,  for  example,  whether  he  has
        attended appointments with them and whether he is listed as one  of
        their emergency contacts.


     2) Letter from ["AA" - L's mother], confirming what  role  he  has  in
        child's life.

     3) Passport or another official document bearing the signature of  AA.
        This is required as we need to verify that  the  signature  of  the
        letter you have provided as evidence of his contact with his  child
        matches that of an official document in the name of AA.

 6. The appellant's solicitors responded to this email on 4 November  2019.
    The email attached a 'signed statement and  passport  copy  from  [AA],
    confirming the role  he  has  in  his  child's  life'.   There  was  no
    explanation for the omission of the document(s) described at (1) of the
    respondent's email.




The Respondent's Decision

 7. The respondent refused the application the following  day,  5  November
    2019.  She noted the  history  which  I  have  already  set  out.   She
    concluded that the appellant was unable to meet the  Immigration  Rules
    before  turning  to  consider  whether  there  were   any   exceptional
    circumstances which warranted granting leave to  remain  on  Article  8
    ECHR  grounds.   The  respondent's  conclusion  in  relation   to   the
    appellant's relationship with his son was as follows:


         You have told us that you are in a parental relationship  with  [L]
         who you have claimed to see often however  the  evidence  that  you
         have submitted shows that when you submitted this application,  you
         had last seen your son four months ago.  It is also considered that
         the refusal of this application would not constitute  a  breach  of
         this department's requirements under Section 55 as your  child  can
         continue to live in the UK with his mother, as he  does  now,  even
         though your application is refused and even if you were outside  of
         the UK.

 8. I should note that the conclusion  in  the  first  sentence  above  was
    premised on the witness statement from AA which had  been  provided  by
    the appellant's solicitors.  That statement was dated 2  November  2019
    and stated that the appellant  had  last  seen  his  son  in  July.  AA
    nevertheless stated that shared parental responsibility for L; that  he
    had an active role in L's upbringing and that he contributed  �100  per
    month to L's upkeep, pursuant to 'a Safeguarding Agreement brokered  by
    the London Borough of Newham'.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 9. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and his  appeal  came
    before the  judge  on  24  January  2020.   He  was  represented  by  a
    solicitor, the respondent was represented by a Presenting Officer.  The
    appellant's solicitors had filed and  served  a  bundle  of  additional
    documents in support of the  appeal.   That  bundle  contained  further
    statements from the appellant and AA; a skeleton argument;  a  copy  of
    L's passport and birth certificate; the correspondence I have described
    at [5]-[6] above and the original application which had  been  made  to
    the respondent (although it appears  that  additional  pages  had  been
    added to this section, reflecting post-decision financial support).

10. The judge heard oral evidence from the  appellant.   Having  considered
    the oral and documentary evidence before her, she  concluded  that  the
    appellant did not have a genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship
    with his son.

11. The judge was concerned by  the  paucity  of  evidence  concerning  the
    relationship: [26].  She noted that there was evidence of money passing
    between the appellant and AA but she was concerned that the sums  shown
    in the bank statements were inconsistent with the account given  by  A.
    AA had stated in her statement that the appellant gave �100 a month but
    the bank statements showed different sums.  The appellant had stated at
    the hearing that AA was 'lying' about the sum, which  varied  according
    to his earnings.  The judge noted that there was written evidence  from
    AA but she had not attended the hearing.  She felt that she could place
    very little weight on the statement because,  if  she  had  wanted  the
    appellant to live in the UK to have a parental  relationship  with  her
    son, 'she would have attended the hearing': [27].

12. The judge attached weight to the absence of any written evidence from L
    himself, as she did to the absence of other documentary evidence  which
    showed  that  contact  was  taking  place.   There   were   no   recent
    photographs, for example: [28].  The judge noted that the appellant had
    said to her that he walked with the appellant to school but he had been
    unable to name the school,  beyond  stating  that  it  was  a  catholic
    school: [29].  The judge considered the appellant's explanation for not
    attending parents' events at his son's school to be inadequate  and  he
    showed no awareness of how his son's schooling was  progressing:  [30].
    He had been unable to explain the activities that he and  his  son  did
    together and his answers in this respect had been vague: [31].

13. At [32], the judge reiterated her concern about the difference  between
    the accounts given by the appellant and AA about the amount of money he
    provided and the fact that the appellant had accused her of lying.  She
    felt unable to rely on the written evidence from AA.  She accepted that
    the appellant provided money to AA but this  did  not  demonstrate,  in
    itself, that he had a relationship or contact with his son:  [32]-[33].
    The appellant had claimed that he had a very strong  relationship  with
    his son but the evidence did not accord with that claim: [34].

14. The appellant had claimed that L  was  his  only  child  but  that  was
    'patently not true' because the appellant had two children in  Nigeria.
    He had abandoned those children when he came to  the  UK  and  had  not
    given an adequate explanation for his failure to  keep  in  touch  with
    them.  The judge considered that the appellant was 'using  his  son  in
    order to get further leave in this country': [35].  She did not  accept
    that the appellant's removal from the UK  would  compromise  his  son's
    best interests: [36].  He had not been truthful at  the  hearing  about
    his relationship with his son and he had not established that there was
    a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.   At  [39],  the  judge
    summarised her findings as follows:

         The appellant claimed that he came to this country in 1996 and  has
         remained ever since.  He claims that he has a family life with  his
         son [L] who is a British citizen aged 13.  I have  found  that  the
         appellant  does  not  have  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
         relationship with his son, [L].  When  the  appellant  was  granted
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom, it was on the basis that the
         appellant, his ex-wife and their son [L] were living together as  a
         family and because [L] was a British citizen.   And they  were  his
         carers together.  [L] is now living with  his  mother  and  I  have
         found that there is no credible evidence that he is in contact with
         [L] or that they have a  subsisting  and  genuine  father  and  son
         relationship.

15. The judge did not accept that the appellant was  likely  to  develop  a
    relationship with his son in the  future;  he  had  abandoned  his  two
    children in Nigeria and he had no intention of fulfilling his  parental
    responsibility towards L, other than giving AA a  little  money:  [41].
    His claim to be in a genuine and subsisting relationship with L  was  a
    cynical attempt to gain an immigration advantage:[41].  He  had  little
    or no contact with his son and it would not interfere with the latter's
    best interests to return the  appellant  to  Nigeria:  [43].  He  could
    establish a relationship with his own children upon return:  [44].   In
    the  circumstances,  the  judge  concluded  that  the  maintenance   of
    immigration control justified the appellant's removal: [45]-[48].

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

16. The grounds upon which permission to appeal  was  sought  are  somewhat
    discursive but may be summarised as follows.  Firstly, that  the  judge
    had left material  matters  out  of  account  in  concluding  that  the
    appellant did not enjoy a genuine and subsisting relationship with  his
    son.  Secondly, that the judge had placed weight on irrelevant  matters
    in drawing  on  the  appellant's  behaviour  towards  his  children  in
    Nigeria.  Thirdly, the judge had failed to consider that the  appellant
    was an anxious witness who had perhaps struggled to give oral evidence.

17. In granting permission to appeal, Judge  Ford  considered  it  arguable
    that the judge  had  failed  to  give  clear  and  cogent  reasons  for
    concluding that the appellant did not have an ongoing relationship with
    his son.  The judge may have erred in 'effectively requiring' a  letter
    from the appellant's son and in placing little weight  on  the  written
    evidence from AA.

18. Directions for the progression of the appeal during the  pandemic  were
    issued by Judge Smith.  The respondent duly provided a response to  the
    grounds of appeal and Ms Nnamani provided a skeleton argument.

19. In developing the arguments in the grounds and the skeleton, Ms Nnamani
    submitted that the judge had  lost  sight  of  the  background  to  the
    appeal.  The appellant had been granted leave to remain in reliance  on
    his relationship with L and he had lived with L and AA as a family unit
    until 2018.  The previous judge's decision had not  been  available  to
    Judge Chana but these facts had been common ground.  The judge had been
    provided with two statements from AA, the first of which had been  sent
    to the respondent in response to her request for further evidence.   It
    was correct that the appellant had not sent anything in response to the
    respondent's first point in that email correspondence  but  Ms  Nnamani
    assumed that he had sent in what was  available  to  him  in  the  time
    available.  She accepted that there had been  no  explanation  provided
    for the missing documents at the time.

20. Ms Nnamani submitted that there had been a  'slight  discrepancy'  over
    the sums which passed between the appellant  and  AA.   But  there  was
    evidence of a genuine and subsisting relationship  being  in  existence
    between father and son.  The question  was  whether,  on  the  evidence
    before the FtT, the judge had been entitled to find that there  was  no
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship.  The judge  had  made  no
    reference to the appeal being allowed in 2017 and no reference  to  the
    appellant living with his son until 2018.  She did not seek to  advance
    a rationality challenge; the point was that the judge had erred in  her
    consideration of the evidence and had made unsustainable findings.  The
    judge had 'ignored' the evidence  from  AA.   There  was  obviously  no
    requirement for the appellant's son to provide a statement  in  support
    and the judge had erred in concluding otherwise.

21. Mr Jarvis relied upon the respondent's reply to the grounds  of  appeal
    dated 18 August 2020.  There was, he submitted, no merit whatsoever  in
    the  grounds.   Ultimately,  the  grounds  amounted  to  a  rationality
    challenge.  The judge had considered  all  of  the  relevant  oral  and
    documentary evidence.  She was well aware of the background.   She  had
    been entitled to attach weight to the absence of AA  from  the  hearing
    and to the discrepancy between her written evidence and the evidence of
    the funds  which  left  the  appellant's  account  for  his  son.   The
    appellant had been unable to recall the name of his  son's  school  and
    there had been no evidence from that school of the appellant's role  in
    L's life.  There was,  in  summary,  nothing  legally  wrong  with  the
    judge's analysis or her conclusions and she had been entitled to attach
    weight to the  appellant's  'slapdash'  attitude  to  his  children  in
    Nigeria.

22. In response, Ms Nnamani submitted  that  the  evidence  clearly  showed
    payments being made by the appellant to AA. He  sometimes  earned  more
    and gave more; that was unsurprising.  She had not attended the hearing
    but there was written evidence from her.  The appellant lived close  to
    his son in East London and he was able to spend time with him at  home.
    The judge's reasoning at [39] was  unsustainable;  the  fact  that  the
    appellant did not live with his son did not mean that he did not have a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with him.  Even  if  there
    was not a genuine and subsisting parental relationship, it was  not  in
    L's best interests for his father to be removed.

23. I reserved my decision at the end of the submissions.

Analysis

24. The First-tier Tribunal is an expert body, tasked with administering  a
    complex area of law in challenging circumstances and  appeals  from  it
    should be approached with a degree of caution; it is probable  that  in
    understanding and applying the law in its specialised  field,  the  FtT
    will have got it right: AH (Sudan) [2007] UKHL 49; [2008] 1 AC 678,  at
    [30], per Lady Hale.  Appellate  courts  should  be  very  cautious  in
    overturning findings of fact made by a first  instance  judge  who  has
    seen witnesses and considered the whole sea of  evidence  before  them.
    Judges hearing appeals on facts should only interfere if a  finding  of
    fact was made which had no basis in the evidence, or where there was  a
    demonstrable misunderstanding of relevant evidence, or  a  demonstrable
    failure to consider relevant evidence so that the  decision  could  not
    reasonably be explained or justified: Mackenzie v  Alcoa  Manufacturing
    [2019] EWA Civ 2110, at [54], per Dingemans LJ, adopting  the  language
    of Lewison LJ in Fage v Chobani [2014] EWCA Civ 5.


25. It might properly be said that the reference to a 'sea of evidence'  is
    not particularly apt in the context of this case, however.  The  signal
    feature of this case, as was apparent to the experienced judge, was the
    absence of evidence which might  ordinarily  be  expected  to  show  an
    ongoing relationship between father and teenage son.  As I  have  noted
    above, there was a dearth  of  evidence  before  the  respondent.   The
    respondent  was  not  required  to  provide  the  appellant   with   an
    opportunity to submit further evidence but she did so, and she provided
    a helpful list of the evidence she considered to  be  missing.   As  Ms
    Nnamani accepted before me, the respondent plainly asked the  appellant
    to submit evidence of each of the three types on  that  list.   He  did
    provide a short statement from AA, supported by a copy of her passport.
     He did not provide a letter on headed paper from  one  of  the  bodies
    listed at (1)  of  the  respondent's  list.   He  did  not  provide  an
    explanation for the absence of that evidence.  Nor did he ask  for  any
    further time to produce it.  When the respondent came to  consider  the
    letter from AA, she noted that it stated that  the  appellant  had  not
    seen his son for four months.  Even before the  case  came  before  the
    judge, therefore, this was a case characterised by little  evidence  of
    the central fact.  That point having been identified  with  clarity  in
    the respondent's letter of refusal, it might have  been  expected  that
    there was a sea of additional  evidence  submitted  to  show  that  the
    appellant continued to have a relationship with his son.


26. There was  very  little  additional  evidence.   There  was  a  further
    statement from AA, which read (in full) as follows:


         I, [AA], of [address given], hereby make this statement in  support
         of Mr Samson Adewusi's appeal against the refusal by the respondent
         to grant an extension of his leave to remain in the United Kingdom.


         I am a Nigerian national and I was born on 11 August 1965.


         I arrived in the United Kingdom in May 2000 and  have  been  living
         here continuously ever since.


         Mr Adewusi, who is the appellant  in  this  appeal,  is  my  former
         partner and we have a child together, [L].  He who was born in  the
         United Kingdom on 16 February 2007 and has lived  in  this  country
         all his life.


         We all used to live together as a family unit until around 30  June
         2018 when my relationship with my former partner broke down.


         Even  though  my  former  partner  and  I  are  no  longer   in   a
         relationship, we continue to  share  parental  responsibility.   Mr
         Adewusi takes an active role in our son's upbringing and  continues
         to see him regularly.  He contributes about �100.00 per  month  for
         the upkeep of our son.


         Our son has a close relationship with Mr Adewusi and it will affect
         him greatly should his father not be allowed to remain  in  the  UK
         with him.  For these reasons, I humbly  ask  for  the  Tribunal  to
         allow his appeal.

27. There was a suggestion in the grounds that the  judge  failed  to  take
    account of this statement, or the statement from AA which preceded  it.
    Ms Nnamani also suggested at one point that the  judge  had  failed  to
    take into account the history of the case, including the fact that  the
    appellant had lived with AA and L until the relationship broke down  in
    2018 and the fact that he had been granted leave  in  reliance  on  the
    relationship(s) in 2017.  Insofar as the grounds are put in  that  way,
    there is no merit in them whatsoever.  The judge plainly considered the
    written evidence from AA but she was unwilling to attach weight  to  it
    because she had not attended the hearing and because  the  account  she
    gave of the appellant's support for his son contradicted  the  evidence
    of payments into the account.  In reaching the latter  conclusion,  the
    judge took account of the appellant's surprisingly robust  response  to
    the point when it was put to him by the  Presenting  Officer,  when  he
    said that AA was lying.   That  was  a  surprising  response  from  the
    appellant, given that the statement which said that  he  provided  �100
    per month was in the bundle prepared by his solicitors.  Equally, as Mr
    Jarvis noted in his excellent submissions, the judge  clearly  referred
    to the relevant history at [3], [5] and [12]-[13] of her decision.


28. As the judge noted, no doubt with an eye on the  exchange  between  the
    respondent and the appellant's solicitors shortly  before  the  refusal
    letter, there was nothing at all from L's school.  Quite aside from the
    appellant having no evidence from the school to show his  role  in  L's
    life, the appellant was unable even to name his son's  school,  despite
    his evidence that he walked him to school on occasion.  There  were  no
    photographs of the two of them together and there was  nothing  from  L
    himself.  The  latter  point  caused  Ms  Nnamani  to  make  a  further
    criticism of the judge, which was that she  had  required  a  statement
    from L.  But the judge did not do so.  Had the judge concluded that she
    was unable to find that there was a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship without a statement from L,  she  would  undoubtedly  have
    erred.  But that was not her conclusion.  The judge merely took account
    of the fact that evidence which should have been readily available  was
    not before her.  There was  nothing  impermissible  in  her  doing  so.
    Should authority for that conclusion be required, it is to be found  in
    TK (Burundi) [2009] EWCA Civ 40, at [16].  The missing evidence in that
    case was from the appellant's ex-partner, whereas what was  missing  in
    this case was evidence from the appellant's thirteen year old son.   It
    was perfectly legitimate for the judge to attach weight to the  absence
    of that evidence, given the issue in this case and the dearth of  other
    evidence.


29. Ms Nnamani submitted in  the  grounds  that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    attaching significance to the appellant's  behaviour  towards  his  two
    adult children in Nigeria.  I do not accept that  submission,  for  the
    reasons given by Mr Jarvis.  The  fact  that  the  appellant  had  lost
    contact with his children when he left Nigeria was  obviously  relevant
    to  the  real  question  before  the  judge,  which  was  whether   the
    relationship that the appellant had enjoyed with his son up to mid-2018
    had come to an end after he separated from AA.  That cannot properly be
    described as an irrelevant matter to  the  resolution  of  the  factual
    issue before the FtT in this case.


30. It is not  established,  therefore,  that  the  judge  failed  to  take
    relevant matters into account.  Nor is it  established  that  she  took
    irrelevant matters into account.  She was clearly cognisant of all  the
    evidence which was and was not before her.  I asked Ms  Nnamani  during
    her submissions whether what she really asserted was that  the  judge's
    decision was perverse or irrational.  Understandably,  she  baulked  at
    that and distanced herself from any such submission.  She  was  correct
    to do so; it could not properly be submitted that  no  judge,  properly
    directing herself to the law and the facts in this case could reach the
    conclusion that the appellant did not enjoy a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with his son.


31. Ms Nnamani preferred to put her complaint along the lines that  it  was
    expressed at various points in her  skeleton  argument.   At  [7],  for
    example, she  submitted  that  the  judge  had  'failed  to  adequately
    consider' the fact that the appellant had lived with his son until 2018
    and at [17] there is the same submission, this time in relation to  the
    written evidence given by AA.  The charge is not that the judge  failed
    to take the material into account,  or  that  she  reached  a  perverse
    conclusion on that evidence; it is  that  she  failed  to  consider  it
    'adequately'.  With respect to Ms Nnamani, this does  not  identify  an
    error of law on the part of the FtT.  Instead,  it  represents  nothing
    more than disagreement with the analysis undertaken by the judge.   The
    weight to be given to particular evidence is obviously a matter for the
    trial judge.  What was said by Green LJ  at  [55]  of  SB  (Sri  Lanka)
    [2019] EWCA Civ 160, regarding the failure of the first instance  judge
    'properly to  analyse  the  evidence'  marks  no  departure  from  that
    principle; the difficulty with the judge's analysis in that  case  was,
    as Green LJ went on to say, was that he had reached a conclusion  which
    was illogical and inconsistent. Judge Chana's conclusions in this  case
    were not illogical or inconsistent.  Faced with a paucity  of  evidence
    and a conflict between the documents, the judge reached the  conclusion
    that the appellant had failed to discharge the burden  of  proving  the
    relationship which would engage s117B(6) of  the  2002  Act.   She  was
    properly entitled to reach that conclusion,  and  she  gave  more  than
    adequate reasons for doing so.


32. I should for the sake of completeness deal with three further  matters.
    Firstly, the contention in ground three that the judge failed  to  take
    into account the possibility that the appellant was a nervous  witness.
    There is no evidence that any such submission was made  to  the  judge,
    however, and there is  certainly  no  suggestion  that  the  judge  was
    invited to treat the appellant as a vulnerable witness.  As  far  as  I
    can see, there is simply no evidence  in  support  of  this  ground  of
    appeal, whether in the form of a witness statement from  the  appellant
    or the solicitor who represented him or medical evidence.


33. Secondly, Ms Nnamani made reference in her skeleton to the decision  of
    UTJ Plimmer in SR (Pakistan) [2018]  UKUT  334  (IAC).   That  decision
    should not have been cited in this context.  Although  Judge  Plimmer's
    decision on the hypothetical question posed by s117B(6) was endorsed by
    the Court of Appeal in AB (Jamaica) and AO (Nigeria) [2019] 1 WLR 4541,
    her conclusion on the meaning of  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship was not: [97] of Singh LJ's judgment  refers,  with  which
    King and Underhill LJ agreed.  There is nothing in the decision in this
    case, however, which demonstrates an approach which was  at  odds  with
    that required by AB & AO.


34. Thirdly, Ms Nnamani sought to develop an alternative argument that  L's
    best interests wrongly fell away upon the judge having  concluded  that
    there was no genuine and subsisting  parental  relationship.   I  agree
    with the premise of the submission, which is that the resolution of the
    question posed by s117B(6) will not in all cases  be  determinative  of
    the  assessment  required  by  s55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and
    Immigration Act 2009 or, for that matter, the wider assessment required
    by Article 8 ECHR.  But the analysis undertaken by the  judge  in  this
    regard was adequate.  She concluded that the appellant was  not  taking
    an active role in the life of  his  son  and  that  they  actually  had
    'little or no contact'.  There was  no  reason  to  believe  that  this
    appellant, who was found to be 'using his son in order to  get  further
    leave in this country', would seek to rekindle  his  relationship  with
    his son.  There was no reason to think, in  those  circumstances,  that
    the best interests of the son could press sufficiently hard to overcome
    the  negative  pull  of  the  appellant's  inability  to  satisfy   the
    Immigration Rules and to fall within s117B(6).


35. The reality of this case is that there was very little evidence of  any
    relationship between the appellant and his  son.   The  high  points  -
    which Ms Nnamani quite properly emphasised in her valiant submissions -
    were the financial  support  and  the  statements  from  AA.   But  the
    financial support did  not,  without  more,  satisfy  the  relationship
    requirement in s117B(6) and  the  written  evidence  given  by  AA  was
    lacking in detail, reduced in weight by her non-attendance and rendered
    even more problematic by the contradiction detailed above.   The  judge
    having reached a rational and proper conclusion on the evidence  before
    her, the proper remedy (in the event that  the  appellant  nevertheless
    wishes to maintain that he has a parental relationship with his son) is
    to make a fresh application under  paragraph  353  of  the  Immigration
    Rules, supported by the evidence which any parent with a  role  in  the
    life of a child would be able to produce.
