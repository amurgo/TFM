                            DECISION AND REASONS


    1. This is the appeal of Danille Toesha Campbell, a citizen  of  Jamaica
       born 8 January 2001, against the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal
       of 17 January 2019, itself brought against the decision of the  entry
       clearance officer to refuse her application to join her mother.


    2. The Sponsor is [IM], a British citizen (since 2014). The  application
       was made on the basis that the  Appellant's  grandmother,  her  legal
       guardian since 2002, was in ill health and could no longer look after
       her. The application was refused because it  was  not  accepted  that
       evidence such as  a  photograph  of  the  grandmother  sitting  in  a
       wheelchair did not establish that she was no longer able to  care  of
       the Appellant, and as there  was  no  confirmation  of  her  father's
       location.  There  was  no  evidence   of   the   Sponsor   exercising
       responsibility for the Appellant's welfare beyond sending remittances
       to Jamaica.

    3. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was to  the  effect  that
       the  Sponsor  had  left  Jamaica,  leaving  the  Appellant   in   her
       grandmother's care, and  had  visited  her  in  2005.  The  Appellant
       continued to live with her grandmother and her  grandmother's  carer.
       There was still no medical evidence available  regarding  her  other.
       Her half-brother was paying for her grandmother's care  but  did  not
       live with her. The Sponsor had been trying to bring the Appellant  to
       the UK since 2011, five applications having been refused;  over  this
       period she visited her daughter annually. The  Sponsor  had  suffered
       from cancer at one time and was unable to have her daughter with  her
       over that period. The grandmother had full control of the Appellant's
       life and continued to do so using the Sponsor's  remittances,  though
       the Sponsor had helped choose the  Appellant's  school,  having  sent
       over a list for her to choose from.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeal on the basis that  there
       was no medical evidence available as to her grandmother's  well-being
       and ability to care for the  Appellant;  there  was  clearly  another
       carer on the scene assisting the grandmother. There was  no  evidence
       of sole responsibility  save  for  her  visits  to  Jamaica,  and  no
       evidence  of  serious  and  compelling  reasons  rendering  exclusion
       undesirable.

    5. Permission to appeal was granted on 29 March 2019 on the  basis  that
       arguably further analysis of the evidence was required.

    6. Mr Nwike submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had given  inadequate
       reasons for its conclusions: the Sponsor  had  stated  that  she  was
       solely responsible for  her  child's  welfare  and  there  was  clear
       evidence of sole responsibility via  the  visits,  payments  and  the
       arrangements for arranging the school to which the  mother  referred.
       Ms Cunha submitted that the evidence was simply inadequate, and  that
       there was nothing to confirm that the important decisions  were  made
       in the child's life had been made by the mother.

Decision and reasons

    7. As I indicated at the hearing, I did not consider any material  error
       of law had been made by the First-tier Tribunal. True it is that  its
       reasons are concise. However, the extent of the reasoning required to
       lawfully determine an appeal is heavily dependent on the  cogency  of
       the material put before the Judge. Despite the Appellant having  been
       on notice since the entry clearance  refusal  of  the  basis  of  the
       Secretary of State's thinking, hardly any material  was  supplied  on
       appeal beyond that which had already been found wanting.


    8.  This  is  particularly  important  vis-ï¿½-vis  issues  such  as   the
       Respondent's concern that no corroborative evidence had been supplied
       that confirmed the grandmother's own care needs. Of  course,  it  can
       reasonably be predicted that an older person will become less able to
       care for a child as they both grow  older.  However,  it  is  equally
       clear that many elderly  individuals  may  be  able  to  continue  to
       provide care, particularly where they have their own carer  providing
       support to them. There  was  simply  no  evidence  in  the  Sponsor's
       witness statement or otherwise as to the decline in the grandmother's
       health such that one could make a finding that she  could  no  longer
       care for the Appellant;  equally,  the  role  of  her  own  carer  is
       unexplained.

    9. In these  circumstances,  it  is  unsurprising  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal rejected the contention that the Sponsor had not shown  that
       she  had  exercised  "sole  responsibility"   for   the   Appellant's
       upbringing since leaving the UK. Aside from a brief statement in oral
       evidence that she had assisted in  choosing  the  Appellant's  school
       (though it is not possible to determine whether she had assisted  the
       Appellant, or the Appellant's grandmother,  in  that  exercise),  the
       other evidence relied  on,  being  her  regular  visits  to  see  her
       daughter and  the  financial  remittances,  does  not  establish  the
       exercise of sole responsibility.

   10. The evidence as to there being serious reasons  for  considering  the
       Appellant's exclusion undesirable is even  more  scant.  It  must  be
       presumed  that  she  remains  in  school  or  college.  There  is  no
       suggestion of any problems with her well-being. The decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal to reject her case on this ground was inevitable.

Decision

The appeal is dismissed.
