Representation:

For the Appellant:     Unrepresented
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant is a female citizen of Thailand, born on  12th  September
    1983.  On 12th October 2012 she applied for leave to remain as a Tier 2
    (General) Migrant.  That application was refused for the reasons  given
    in the Notice of Decision dated  20th  December  2012.   The  Appellant
    appealed, and her appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
    Wyman (the Judge) sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  3rd  April  2013.   She
    allowed the appeal on the basis that the Respondent's decision was  not
    in accordance with the law for the reasons given in  her  Determination
    promulgated on 15th April 2013.  The Respondent sought leave to  appeal
    that decision, and on 30th April 2013 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The application for leave to remain was refused because  the  Appellant
    failed to score any points for Appropriate Salary under Appendix  A  of
    HC 395.  This was because according to the Appellant's  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship her prospective employment  most  closely  corresponded  to
    occupation code 1132 of the Codes of Practice set out  in  Appendix  J.
    The minimum acceptable hourly rate of pay for occupation code 1132  was
    �10.55 per hour, whereas the salary offered to the Appellant was at the
    rate of �10.34 per hour.

 4. The Judge found nothing wrong with this decision, but decided to  allow
    the appeal for the reason that the decision was not in accordance  with
    the law because in making the decision the  Respondent  had  failed  to
    apply her own Evidential Flexibility Policy following the  decision  in
    Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC).

 5. At the hearing, Mr Avery argued that the Judge had erred  in  law.   He
    referred to  the  grounds  seeking  leave  and  pointed  out  that  the
    validation trial part of the Policy relied upon by the  Judge  had  not
    been in force at the date of the decision.  In any event, the Policy as
    interpreted in Rodriguez had no application because this was not a case
    where more information might be extracted from  the  Appellant.   There
    had been nothing overtly wrong with the Appellant's application such as
    information being omitted.

 6. The Appellant was given the opportunity to respond to  this  submission
    but did not contend that there had not been an error of law.

 7. I find an error of law as argued by Mr Avery.  It is the case that  the
    Appellant's application for leave to remain was made and decided  after
    the pilot trial period of  the  Evidential  Flexibility  Policy.   That
    trial period expired on 30th June 2011.  In any event, this  is  not  a
    case to which the Policy might have  been  applied.   The  Policy  only
    applies where it is apparent to the Respondent that there has been some
    omission which might be rectified by seeking further  information.   It
    does not apply in a case such as this where the information supplied is
    complete  but  indicates  that  the  Appellant  does   not   meet   the
    requirements of the relevant Immigration Rule.

 8. Having found an error of  law,  I  proceeded  to  re-make  the  Judge's
    decision.





Re-made Decision

 9. Throughout these  proceedings  it  has  not  been  contested  that  the
    decision of the Respondent was correct in that for the reasons given in
    the Notice of Decision the Appellant scored insufficient  points  under
    Appropriate Salary of Appendix A to HC 395 to meet the requirements  of
    paragraph 245HD(f) again of HC 395.  I therefore re-make  the  decision
    by dismissing the appeal.

10.  The  Respondent  also  decided  to  remove  the  Appellant  under  the
    provisions of Section 47 Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.
    The Judge correctly found that decision to be not  in  accordance  with
    the law following the decision in Ahmadi [2012] UKUT  00147  (IAC)  and
    that decision has not been impugned in this appeal.  I do not set aside
    that decision.

Decision

11. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point  of  law  but  only  as  to  the  Judge's
    decision under the Immigration Rules.  I set aside that decision and re-
    make it by dismissing the appeal.

Anonymity

The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  45(4)(i)  of
the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005  and  I  also  do
not do so.
