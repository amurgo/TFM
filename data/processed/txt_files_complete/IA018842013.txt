Representation:

For the appellant:     not present or represented
For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan, born on 22nd January 1972.  His
    appeal against the decision of the respondent, made  on  27th  December
    2012, refusing his application for  further  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and to remove  him
    from the United Kingdom under section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and
    Nationality Act 2006 was dismissed, save that the appeal was allowed in
    respect of the decision to remove the appellant, on  the  grounds  that
    the respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law.

 2. The appellant did not attend the hearing.  I satisfied myself  that  he
    had been given proper notice of the hearing and had  not  provided  any
    reason for his absence.  In these circumstances I  considered  that  it
    was in the interests of justice to proceed  with  the  hearing  in  the
    appellant's absence.

 3. The appellant's  application  was  refused  on  the  grounds  that  the
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies Checking Service was checked  on
    27th December 2012 and it confirmed that  the  CAS  the  appellant  had
    submitted with his application had been withdrawn by  the  sponsor  and
    therefore no points had been awarded.

 4. In his grounds of appeal the appellant  complained  that  the  CAS  was
    unfairly withdrawn by his sponsor even though he had paid  the  sum  of
    ï¿½2,500.  He said that his college had withdrawn his  CAS  and  that  of
    many other students.  When they contacted the college they could get no
    answer.  He said he was gathering the refusal letters of  all  students
    and would send them to the Tribunal shortly.  In the event he  did  not
    do so.

 5. In paragraph 14 of his determination the First-tier Tribunal judge said
    that he found that the parties agreed that the CAS number was withdrawn
    as at the date of decision, 27th December  2012.   He  found  that  the
    appellant was not entitled to 30 points as claimed for the reasons  set
    out in the respondent's letter of refusal.   He  also  found  that  the
    appellant was not entitled to 10  points  as  claimed  for  maintenance
    (funds) as he had not provided a valid CAS  with  his  application  and
    therefore the respondent was unable to assess his remaining course fees
    and monthly maintenance (funds) requirement.  He therefore  found  that
    the appeal under the immigration rules fell to be dismissed.   He  went
    on to dismiss the appeal on human rights grounds under article 8 of the
    ECHR.

 6. Mr Tarlow was obliged to concede that the First-tier Tribunal judge had
    not considered the appellant's grounds of appeal, namely  that  he  was
    not a party to the decision to withdraw the CAS and was  not  aware  of
    the action by the sponsor so that he should be given 60 days'  time  to
    find a new CAS on the basis of fairness.

 7. I am satisfied that this  failure  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge
    amounted to an error of law.   The  difficulty  facing  the  appellant,
    however, is that he did not seek an oral hearing of the  appeal  before
    the First-tier Tribunal at which he could have given evidence about not
    knowing that the CAS had been withdrawn  and  he  did  not  attend  the
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal, with the result that I have no  more
    evidence before me than had the First-tier Tribunal judge.

 8. No reasonable First-tier Tribunal judge could have allowed  the  appeal
    on the basis of unsupported assertions made by  the  appellant  in  his
    grounds of appeal.  For the appellant to establish that the  respondent
    had acted unfairly he would have needed to show that he was unaware  of
    the withdrawal of his CAS and had no reasonable means of  knowing  that
    it had been withdrawn until the  decision  of  the  respondent  on  his
    application.  In the same way that an allegation of dishonesty  on  the
    part of an applicant, made by the respondent, would have been incapable
    of establishing the truth of  what  was  asserted  in  the  absence  of
    evidence (see RP (proof of forgery) Nigeria [2006] UKAIT 00086), so the
    lack of evidence in support of the assertions made in  the  grounds  of
    appeal would have proved  fatal  to  the  success  of  the  appellant's
    appeal, had the First-tier Tribunal judge  considered  the  grounds  of
    appeal.  Therefore the error of law made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge was immaterial to the outcome of the appeal, as the appeal had no
    chance of success.

 9. In these circumstances I dismiss the appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,  so
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
