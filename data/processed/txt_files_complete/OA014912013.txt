                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms Watterson, Counsel, instructed by Mondair
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Specialist Appeals Team


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal  against  a  decision  by  an
    Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance as the spouse  of
    a British national. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  anonymity
    order, and I do not consider that such an order is required  for  these
    proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The appellant is a national of Pakistan, whose  date  of  birth  is  18
    November 1989.  She submitted an application form in October 2012.  She
    wished to travel to the UK on 15 October 2012.  She had previously been
    refused a visa for the UK on 18 October  2011,  as  the  ECO  was  "not
    satisfied."  She was related to her sponsor outside marriage, as he was
    her cousin.  She had first met him on 29 November 2009 in  Jhelum,  and
    their relationship had begun on 10 December 2009.  She  had  last  seen
    him in Pakistan in June 2011.  They had lived in a marital relationship
    within Pakistan from 10 December 2009 to 20 March  2010,  and  from  30
    March 2011 to 5 June 2011.  Her sponsor had a child, S, by  a  previous
    relationship.  The child S lived with her mother, and her  husband  was
    not responsible for her financial support.

 3.  Her  sponsor  was  a  self-employed  businessman  trading   as   "Ajaz
    Valetting."  He had been engaged in this  business  activity  since  15
    July 2011.

 4. On 15 November 2012 an Entry Clearance Officer in  Islamabad  gave  his
    reasons for refusing the appellant's application.  Firstly, he was  not
    satisfied that the appellant was eligible  for  entry  clearance  as  a
    partner.  She had not provided the only acceptable evidence of a United
    Kingdom divorce, which was a decree absolute.  So he was not  satisfied
    that her sponsor's previous relationship had broken down, and they were
    able and genuinely intended to marry in the UK.

 5. Secondly, her sponsor was not exempt from the financial requirements as
    defined by  paragraph  E-ECP.3.3.   In  order  to  meet  the  financial
    requirements of the Rules, her sponsor's  income  from  self-employment
    and other income in the last full financial year, or as an  average  of
    the last two financial years, needed to be at least �18,600 per annum.

 6. She said that her sponsor's gross income before tax in  the  last  full
    financial year as Ajaz Valetting was �16,098.  She also said  that  her
    sponsor received a rental income in the past twelve  months  of  �6,000
    before tax.  But she has not submitted all the  required  documentation
    listed in Appendix FM-SE to demonstrate  either  her  sponsor's  rental
    income or his income from self-employment in the  past  twelve  months.
    So her application was refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of  Appendix
    FM of the Rules.

 7. In her grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant said
    that the sponsor's previous marriage had been under Islamic  law,  "not
    in a British marriage law". Her sponsor had been given a divorce  under
    Islamic law, which could be seen by the submitted documents.

 8. With regard to the financial requirements, she was now enclosing:

         All  the  new  relevant   documentary   evidences   i.e.   self-tax
         assessments,  tax  returns  and   evidence   of   the   amount   of
         payable/paid, letter from HM Revenue and Customs  for  confirmation
         of unique tax payer reference (UTR), letter from accountant, latest
         audited  accounts  for  the  period  ended  July   2012,   mortgage
         statements, letter from  Smart  Move  Property  Solutions  who  has
         acting as letting agents for my sponsor, tenancy  agreements,  bank
         statements as proof of  rental  income  receiving  by  my  sponsor.



 9. In light of these documents, the ECO's objection was  totally  baseless
    and the requirements of Appendix FM were satisfied. The appellant  also
    asked for her appeal to be considered under Article 8 ECHR.

The Hearing before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appellant's appeal came  before  Judge  Jessica  Pacey  sitting  at
    Sheldon Court, Birmingham, on 23  January  2014.   Mr  Ali  of  Counsel
    appeared on  behalf  of  the  appellant,  and  Ms  Owens,  Home  Office
    Presenting Officer, appeared on behalf of the Entry Clearance  Officer.
    The judge received oral evidence from the sponsor, Mr Ajaz Shakil.   In
    his witness statement dated 15 January 2014, he said he had  been  born
    in Peterborough on 15 April 1969.   He  was  previously  married  to  a
    British national who had been born in Pakistan.  They had married on 19
    October 1997 in Peterborough in accordance with Islamic  marriage  law.
    They were never married in accordance with English law, because Islamic
    marriages conducted in the UK were not recognised in the UK  as  valid.
    They had separated in March 2009, and he had divorced his Islamic  wife
    on 29 December 2010.  Although  this  was  after  he  had  married  the
    appellant, it did not affect the validity of his marriage to her, as it
    was an Islamic marriage, and Islam allowed polygamy.

11. He had one child from his previous marriage, his  daughter  S  who  had
    been born on 3 March 2003.   He  did  not  see  S  as  her  mother  had
    remarried in 2012.  But he hoped  that  one  day  their  contact  would
    resume.  After his relationship with his  first  wife  broke  down,  he
    decided to remarry and his family had arranged the  marriage  with  the
    appellant.  This marriage was solemnised on 10 December 2009 in Jhelum.



12. He was self-employed as a car valetor.  He ran a mobile car wash.   His
    turnover was over �30,000 a year.  In the  tax  year  ended  2012,  his
    profit was �18,524.  His total income for taxation purposes in that tax
    year was �20,431.  In the tax year for 2012 to 2013,  his  profit  from
    his car valeting business was �18,536  and  he  had  rental  income  of
    �1,945.  This gave rise to a total income of �20,481.

13. It was true that unfortunately they had not provided  some  of  the  so
    called  specified  evidence.   They  had  relied  on  advice  that  the
    appellant's maternal uncle had  received  from  a  local  solicitor  in
    Pakistan.  He was certain the Entry Clearance Officer would have access
    to his details from HMRC and that should anything else be required  the
    Entry Clearance Officer would contact them to request it.  He  was  now
    attaching his self-assessment tax returns for the  tax  year  that  was
    relied  on  in  the  appellant's  application,  together  with  various
    documents from HMRC and his accountants.  He was  also  attaching  bank
    statements, evidence of title in relation to his residential and rental
    properties, mortgage statements and evidence of rental income.  If  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had requested these  instead  of  refusing  his
    wife's application, they would have provided this  evidence  and  there
    would have been no need for the waste of  the  court's  time  or  their
    time.  Over fourteen months had elapsed since  his  wife's  application
    was refused, and it was over sixteen months since they applied.  Such a
    long delay had caused a lot of worries and stress to both of them.

14. He felt that the refusal of Nida's application was against their  right
    to respect for family life.  His father had passed away in  1991.   His
    mother was elderly and as the only child he had to take  care  of  her.
    His mother's health had deteriorated in the last couple  of  years  and
    she was suffering a lot from not being able to live in a  full  family.
    He could not leave his mother in the UK alone, as  she  required  daily
    support and care.  So when he had visited Pakistan in the  last  couple
    of years his mother had always travelled with him.  One of the  reasons
    he had not visited his wife since 2012 was that his mother was not  fit
    any longer to travel such a long distance.

15. He was not prepared to move to Pakistan to live with Nida  in  Pakistan
    because of  his  family  here,  his  friends  here,  his  business  and
    properties here, the socio-economic and safety situation  in  Pakistan,
    and the lack of adequate medical assistance in Pakistan.

16. Although Nida and he were managing to maintain their  family  life  via
    calls and visits, this was not suitable as a  long-term  solution.   It
    was always meant to be only a temporary arrangement until  Nida  joined
    her in the UK.

17. In her subsequent determination, Judge Pacey accepted that the  sponsor
    had obtained an Islamic divorce  on  29  December  2010,  following  an
    Islamic marriage, and therefore under  British  law  he  had  not  been
    married before he had married the appellant.  They were therefore  free
    to marry.

18. She turned to the issue of the sponsor's earnings.  She  accepted  that
    as the sponsor was paid in cash, he would not necessarily pay all  that
    income into his bank account.  However,  the  Rules  were  precise  and
    mandatory and required that  income  be  shown  as  paid  into  a  bank
    account, and they required that audited accounts be provided.  She  had
    a letter from HMRC to the sponsor,  providing  the  UTR.   However  the
    letter was dated 6 12.12 and was, it appears, written in response to  a
    telephone call made on the sponsor's behalf on  23.11.12.   Both  dates
    were after the date of application and the date of decision.   She  had
    the sponsor's accounts for  the  period  ending  31.7.12.   These  were
    however clearly stated to be unaudited.

19. The judge reminded herself of the guidance given in Gulshan (Article  8
    - New Rules - Correct Approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) at paragraph  24.



20. The judge held that no evidence had been presented to  her  that  there
    were good grounds for granting leave to remain outside the Rules.  This
    was the second application made by the appellant, and it was  therefore
    reasonable to suppose that she would have taken the  greatest  care  to
    ensure that the current application was correct in  all  details.   She
    argued that an agent had wrongly advised her.  There was no evidence of
    this having been the case. In any event, the instructions provided with
    the form were to her mind clear and there could have been no  room  for
    confusion.

21. She accepted the sponsor had the  rental  income  claimed,  as  he  had
    provided the requisite evidence.  On the balance of probabilities,  and
    on the totality of the  evidence,  she  found  the  appellant  had  not
    discharged the burden of proof in relation to her  sponsor's  financial
    circumstances.  She therefore dismissed the appeal under the Rules.

The Application for Permission to Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

22. The appellant's solicitors applied on  her  behalf  for  permission  to
    appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  Ground 1 was that the judge had erred in
    law in holding that there  was  a  requirement  for  the  appellant  to
    provide audited accounts in respect of the sponsor's business.

23. Ground 2 was that the judge had erred in law in excluding the  evidence
    relating to the UTR.  The evidence provided appertained to facts before
    the date of the decision, and therefore did  not  amount  to  postdated
    evidence.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

24. On 23 April 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Heynes granted permission to
    appeal on the ground that it was an arguable error of law in that there
    was no finding by Judge Pacey as to the sponsor's income.

The Rule 24 Response

25. On 10 June 2014 a member of the Specialist Appeals Team settled a  Rule
    24 response on behalf of the respondent.   The  respondent's  case  was
    that  the  Judge  of   the   First-tier   Tribunal   directed   herself
    appropriately.  The grounds of appeal had no merit and did no more than
    disagree with the cogent findings of the judge.  Appendix FM-SE clearly
    stipulated what documents were required.  It was stated by the judge at
    paragraph 15 of her determination that various documents had  not  been
    submitted.  The judge had reached a conclusion open to her based on the
    evidence, the Rules and relevant case law, and  her  determination  did
    not disclose any error.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

26. At the hearing before me, Ms Watterson conceded  that  the  appeal  was
    rightly dismissed under the Rules.  She submitted that  the  judge  had
    erred in law in her approach to an alternative claim under  Article  8,
    and that on the particular facts  of  this  case,  the  decision  under
    Article 8 should be re-made in the appellant's favour.

Discussion

27. At the time when the appellant made her application, and  also  at  the
    date of decision, paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE provided as follows:

         In respect of self-employment in the UK as a  partner,  as  a  sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:

         (d)  Each partner's unique tax reference number (UTR)  and  or  the
             UTR of the partnership or business.

         (f)  Monthly personal bank statements for  the  same  twelve  month
             period as the tax returns showing that the income  from  self-
             employment has been paid into an account in the  name  of  the
             person or in the name of the person and their partner jointly.

         (h)  One of the following documents must also be submitted:

              (i) the organisation's latest annual audited accounts with:

                  (1)  the name of the accountant clearly showing; and

                  (2)  the accountant must be  a  member  of  an  accredited
                      accounting body ...

28. Shortly after the refusal decision, a number of changes to Appendix FM-
    SE, including changes to paragraph 7, were introduced by HC  760.   One
    of the changes which came into  force  on  13  December  2012  was  the
    deletion of paragraph  7(h)(i).   In  its  place  was  substituted  the
    following:

         (i)(aa)  That the applicant's business is a registered company that
                is required to   produce annual audited accounts, the latest
                such accounts; or

           (bb)   if the applicant's business is not  required  to  produce
                annual audited accounts, the latest unaudited  accounts  and
                an  accountant's  certificate  of  confirmation,   from   an
                accountant who is a member of a  UK  recognised  supervisory
                body (as defined in the Companies Act 2006);

29. The judge was bound to apply the Rule  as  it  stood  at  the  date  of
    decision, and therefore she did not err in  law  in  finding  that  the
    appellant had failed to comply with the requirement to provide  audited
    accounts.

30. It is to be noted that paragraph 7(h), both in  its  original  and  its
    amended form, gives the applicant  a  series  of  alternative  options.
    Accordingly, instead  of  providing  a  document  which  satisfies  the
    requirements of sub-paragraph (i), in theory an applicant can provide a
    document which satisfies the requirements of sub-paragraph  (ii).   But
    in the appellant's case, the only conceivable way  in  which  he  could
    comply with paragraph 7(h), given the nature and extent of his business
    activities, was the provision of audited accounts.

31. I note from the judge's manuscript Record of Proceedings  that  Counsel
    for the appellant raised the question of evidential flexibility in  his
    closing submissions.  As submitted  by  Ms  Watterson  before  me,  the
    change to paragraph 7(h)(i) introduced in December 2012 can be read  as
    a recognition that the earlier  Rule  was  too  onerous,  and  possibly
    unworkable.  This  in  turn  lends  support  to  an  argument  that  in
    retrospect the Entry Clearance Officer should have exercised discretion
    not to apply the requirement for the specified document, in  accordance
    with the evidential flexibility provision contained in  paragraph  1(k)
    of Appendix FM-SE.  The version of this sub-paragraph which appears  in
    Phelan, 8th Edition (which provides a snapshot of  the  Rules  as  they
    stood on 5 September 2012) states inter alia as follows:

         Where the specified documents cannot be supplied (e.g. because they
         are not available in a particular country or have been  permanently
         lost), the case worker has discretion not to apply the requirements
         of the specified documents or to request alternative or  additional
         information or documents to be submitted by the applicant.

32. Ironically this version of sub-paragraph (k) was deleted on 13 December
    2012, and thus a relaxation in the Rules  was  counterbalanced  by  the
    tightening up  of  the  evidential  flexibility  policy,  at  least  as
    codified in paragraph 1 of  Appendix  FM-SE.   However,  an  equivalent
    evidential flexibility provision  remained  in  the  IDIs  for  "Family
    members under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules - Annex  FM  Section
    FM 1.7, financial requirement"  at  paragraph  5.2.  This  provides  as
    follows:

         Caseworkers should normally refuse an application  which  does  not
         provide the specified documents.   However,  where  documents  have
         been submitted, but not as specified, and the caseworker  considers
         that, if the specified documents were submitted, it would result in
         a grant of leave,  they  should  contact  the  applicant  or  their
         representative in writing or otherwise to request the documents  he
         submitted within a reasonable timeframe.

33. While the issue of evidential flexibility was raised before the  First-
    tier Tribunal, it was not argued before the  First-tier  Tribunal  that
    the appellant  did,  or  could,  surmount  the  preliminary  hurdle  of
    establishing that the Entry Clearance  Officer  should  have  exercised
    evidential flexibility in circumstances where a significant  number  of
    specified documents had not been provided with the application.

34. The thrust of Mr Ali's submissions before the First-tier  Tribunal  was
    that the sponsor had now provided all the specified documents which  he
    was able to provide, and that he had a good excuse  for  not  providing
    the remainder, namely  (a)  bank  statements  which  showed  him  being
    credited with his net income from self-employment; and (b)  audited  as
    opposed to unaudited accounts.  But it was  not  the  judge's  role  to
    exercise evidential flexibility.  She had to apply the Rules. So  there
    was no error in her finding that the appellant did  not  qualify  under
    the Rules, and she also did not err in finding that the decision of the
    Entry Clearance Officer was otherwise in accordance with the law.

35. Ms Watterson submits that the judge erred  in  law  in  her  Article  8
    assessment because she did not  have  regard  to  the  decision  of  Mr
    Justice Blake in MM.  Ms Watterson submits the interference is  plainly
    disproportionate in circumstances where the sponsor does in  fact  meet
    the financial requirements, as evidenced by the HMRC documentation; and
    there are serious difficulties in the sponsor  relocating  to  Pakistan
    for the reasons given  by  him  in  his  witness  statement.   But  the
    guidance given in Gulshan, to which the judge makes  express  reference
    in her determination, takes into account the decision in  MM.   So  the
    judge cannot be said to have overlooked the implications of  MM,  which
    in any event has now been overturned by the Court of Appeal.

36.  Moreover,  Mr  Justice  Blake  did  not  find  that   the   evidential
    requirements in  Appendix  FM-SE  were  themselves  unlawful,  or  even
    disproportionate.  The ratio of  MM,  as  interpreted  by  Gulshan,  is
    simply that for British national spouses, or spouses who are  refugees,
    an insistence on a minimum income threshold of �18,600 per  year  might
    in some cases be disproportionate.  But, unlike the  claimants  in  MM,
    the problem here is not an inability on the part of  the  appellant  to
    meet the income threshold of �18,600 a year,  but  simply  an  historic
    failure to comply with the evidential requirements  to  show  that  her
    sponsor has an income of at least �18,600 per  year.   Accordingly,  as
    submitted by Mr Tufan, the solution is for  the  appellant  to  make  a
    fresh application, which  complies  with  Appendix  FM-SE.   Since  the
    option of making a  fresh  application  is  readily  available  to  the
    appellant, the earlier refusal does not  have  consequences  which  are
    unjustifiably harsh.

37. Ms  Watterson  accepts  that  this  is  a  reasonable  option  for  the
    appellant, save that there is a lingering uncertainty about her ability
    to comply fully with Appendix FM-SE.  She  no  longer  has  to  provide
    audited accounts, but she remains unable to provide bank statements for
    the sponsor that show him receiving his stated income  from  his  self-
    employment, and she is never going to be able to do so in the future.

38. The solution is for the  appellant  to  invoke  evidential  flexibility
    principles as part of her  fresh  application.   It  can  be  expressly
    acknowledged that the sponsor's bank statements do not show the receipt
    of income (for the good reason and excuse recognised by Judge Pacey  in
    her determination), and the Entry  Clearance  Officer  can  be  invited
    instead to take into account documentary evidence from  other  sources,
    including HMRC, of the sponsor's annual income.

Decision

39. For the above reasons, I find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal did not contain an error of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside and  re-made.   Accordingly,  this  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.






Signed                              Date


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Monson
