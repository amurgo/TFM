                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS









      Introduction


      1.    The Appellant appealed with  permission  granted  by  First-tier
           Tribunal Judge Page on 10 April 2017 against  the  decision  and
           reasons of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chana who had dismissed the
           Appellant's protection and human rights  appeal.   The  decision
           and reasons was promulgated on 13 December 2016.


      2.    The Appellant is a national of Albania.  She had been recognised
           a victim of modern slavery by the Respondent in the reasons  for
           refusal letter dated 18 February 2016 but her  protection  claim
           had been refused on the basis  that  relocation  was  reasonable
           and/or there was a sufficiency of protection.  The judge agreed.


      3.    Permission to appeal  was  granted  by  Judge  Page  because  he
           considered that the judge had arguably erred by stating that the
           Respondent had doubts about the Appellant's  credibility,  which
           was not so.


      4.    Standard directions were made  by  the  tribunal.    A  rule  24
           notice accepting that there was a  material  error  of  law  was
           filed by the Respondent, dated 5 May 2017.




      Submissions


      5.    Mr Moriarty submitted that his appeal succeeded  by  concession,
           and asked that  it  be  reheard  ab  initio  in  the  First-tier
           Tribunal.  There would be further matters  which  the  Appellant
           might wish to raise and he was accordingly not in a position  to
           proceed  despite  the   tribunal's   willingness   to   continue
           immediately.


      6.    Mr Duffy agreed that the appeal should be reheard in the  First-
           tier Tribunal.




      Discussion - error of law


      7.    To a significant extent the decision as to whether  there  is  a
           material error of law is taken out of the Upper Tribunal's hands
           when a rule 24 notice conceding an appeal  is  filed  by  either
           party.  When that concession is made by the Secretary of  State,
           it is of particular  significance,  given  that  the  tribunal's
           jurisdiction is one of public law  and  that  the  Secretary  of
           State retains inherent, extra-statutory  powers.   Although  the
           tribunal would have preferred to have heard proper  argument  as
           to whether any of the First-tier Tribunal judge's alleged errors
           of law were material, such a course if insisted on may have been
           controversial, generating  further  costly  and  wasteful  legal
           challenges.


      8.    Certainly the judge erred at [1] of her decision and reasons  by
           referring to the Appellant as male, although  that  was  quickly
           put right in the next paragraph.  At [7] the judge  stated  that
           the Respondent had doubts  about  the  Appellant's  credibility.
           That was inaccurate and infelicitous wording  at  best,  because
           (as noted above) it had been accepted by the Respondent that the
           Appellant was a victim of modern slavery.  Again it can be  seen
           that the error was  firmly  corrected  at  [32]  and  the  judge
           proceeded   thereafter   to   deal   with   the   real    issues
           (relocation/sufficiency    of     protection)     in     detail.
           Unfortunately, at [49] the judge's otherwise  forceful  critique
           of the medical report includes a statement that no  mention  was
           made by the doctor of the  Appellant's  working  in  the  United
           Kingdom.  That was a mistake, as mention of working was made  in
           the long, abstruse and jargon laden report: see, e.g.,  ï¿½2.2.11.
            The judge probably meant to say  that  there  was  insufficient
           discussion by the doctor of the significance of the  Appellant's
           ability to work, given the generally  pessimistic  tone  of  the
           report, although whether such a gloss is permissible would  have
           to await argument.  Obviously it is  preferable  for  judges  to
           state their intended meaning plainly.


      9.    The tribunal records these matters so that the  next  judge  can
           avoid repeating such errors, whether  or  not  they  were  truly
           material.  It may  well  be  that  examination  of  the  current
           objective and country background evidence will lead to the  same
           outcome. That remains to be seen.  Material errors of law having
           been conceded by the Respondent, the onwards appeal  is  allowed
           to that extent.  No interpreter was available  and  it  was  not
           possible to proceed to a rehearing in the Upper Tribunal.
