Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Walker (Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr Sultan (Legal Representative)

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. Whereas the original respondent is the appealing party, I shall, in the
    interests of convenience and consistency, replicate the nomenclature of
    the decision at first instance.


 2. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh and is now  twenty-five  years
    of age. He applied on July 31, 2014 for an extension  of  stay  as  the
    spouse of a person  settled  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  respondent
    refused his application on September 18, 2014 on the grounds:

     a.  He  had  failed  to  provide  specified  evidence  to  demonstrate
        compliance with Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules.
     b. He had failed  to  demonstrate  he  came  within  Section  EX.1  of
        Appendix FM.
     c. He did not satisfy paragraph 276ADE HC 395.
     d. There were no exceptional circumstances.

 3. At the same time took a decision to remove pursuant to  section  47  of
    the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.


 4. The appellant appealed  that  decision  on  September  30,  2014  under
    section 82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. The matter came before Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Cooper on March
    4, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on March 30, 2015 she allowed the
    appellant's appeal under both the Immigration Rules and on the face  of
    it article 8 ECHR.

 6. The respondent applied for permission  to  appeal  on  April  13,  2015
    submitting the Tribunal had erred by  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Immigration Rules. No challenge was made to the purported  decision  on
    under article 8.

 7. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Andrew gave permission  to  appeal  on
    June 1, 2015 finding it arguable the Tribunal  had  arguably  erred  by
    allowing the appeal having made its decision  based  on  the  sponsor's
    credibility instead of applying the Immigration Rules and in particular
    Appendix FM-SE.

 8. The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
    pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 I see no reason to make an order now.

    ERROR OF LAW SUBMISSIONS

 9. Mr Walker submitted that the Tribunal had materially erred in  allowing
    the appeal under the Immigration Rules. The refusal letter clearly  set
    out the requirements that had to be met and the appellant had failed to
    satisfy Appendix FM-SE A1(n) which specifically required the  appellant
    to demonstrate wages being paid into a bank account.  The  sponsor  had
    two jobs according to the evidence but had only demonstrated,  for  the
    relevant period, that the income for one of her  jobs  was  being  paid
    into her bank account. This was a specified requirement  of  the  Rules
    and by failing to submit evidence of her  wages  being  paid  into  her
    account the appellant was unable to satisfy  the  Rules.  The  Tribunal
    materially erred by allowing the appeal under the Rules.
10. Mr Sultan submitted that the Tribunal was entitled to make the decision
    it had bearing in mind section 85 (5) of the 2002 Act and having regard
    to the evidential flexibility policy contained  within  the  Rules.  He
    produced a document that he referred to as an extract  from  the  Rules
    which enabled decision-makers to grant  an  application  despite  minor
    evidential problems. He accepted that the appellant could  not  produce
    evidence to show wages being paid into her account but argued that  the
    Tribunal exercised its discretion correctly in paragraph  [17]  of  its
    decision.


    ERROR OF LAW DECISION


11. When this matter came before the Tribunal the  respondent  opposed  the
    application under the Immigration Rules because Appendix FM-SE had  not
    been met. Whilst the Tribunal found the sponsor to  be  an  honest  and
    credible witness the Rules make clear that for wages to be  taken  into
    account for the purposes of calculating whether the appellant  has  met
    the  �18,600  threshold,  the  appellant  had  to  produce  documentary
    evidence confirming the sponsor was employed, evidence  of  wage  slips
    and evidence of those wages being paid to her.


12. I am satisfied the sponsor did not satisfy this final  requirement.  It
    is not optional but mandatory. The Rule (Appendix FM-SE A1(n)) is quite
    clear. If a person is paid in cash and the net payment on the wage slip
    is reflected in the bank statement, then the gross figure on  the  wage
    slips can be taken into consideration. However, if the  amount  on  the
    wage slip is not reflected on the bank statement then only  the  amount
    paid in can be taken into account. In this case there was  no  evidence
    of any wages from this particular employer being  paid  into  the  bank
    account  and  consequently  the  Tribunal  should  have   refused   the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules  Mr Sultan's argument on
    evidential flexibility or Section 85(5) of the 2002 Act has  absolutely
    no bearing for the simple reason  that  the  appellant  was  unable  to
    produce this evidence at the hearing.

13. Accordingly, unless the  appellant  could  demonstrate  that  he  could
    succeed under either Section EX.1 of Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE HC
    395 his appeal under the Immigration Rules must fail.


14. The  Tribunal's  decision  is  incomplete  because  having  erroneously
    decided to allow the appeal for meeting the financial  requirements  of
    the Rules the Tribunal then failed to go on to consider Section EX.1 of
    Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE HC 395.

15. I therefore find that in so far as the Immigration Rules are  concerned
    there was a material error.

16. I indicated to the representatives but I  would  need  to  remake  that
    decision and in remaking it I would have regard  to  Section  EX.1  and
    paragraph 276ADE HC 395.

17. I also raised with Mr Walker the fact that it seemed the  Tribunal  had
    allowed the appellant's appeal under article 8 although that grant  was
    not included in its "notice of decision".

18. Mr Walker agreed that anyone reading paragraph [18] of  the  Tribunal's
    decision would have concluded that the Tribunal allowed the  appeal  on
    the principles set out in Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.   Mr  Walker
    indicated to me that the respondent had not appealed that part  of  the
    decision and he accepted that the Tribunal had allowed the appeal under
    article 8.

19. I indicated to both parties that in light of that  concession  I  would
    deal with the outstanding issue under the Immigration  Rules  based  on
    the documents that were currently before me.

20. Mr Sultan asked if a short statement from the sponsor could be admitted
    as  it  set  out  why  she  felt  there  would  be  "very   significant
    difficulties" or  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  her  joining  her
    husband in Bangladesh. Mr Walker was content for this  document  to  be
    admitted and he stated he did not have any questions for  the  witness.
    The witness signed the document and I admitted this in as evidence.

    SUBMISSIONS ON IMMIGRATION RULES

21. Mr Walker submitted that whilst the sponsor  faced  difficulties  these
    were neither "very  significant  difficulties"  nor  "very  significant
    obstacles". With regard to section EX.1 he submitted that this was  not
    a case where the sponsor had to accompany the appellant  to  Bangladesh
    because the Tribunal had already allowed  him  leave  to  remain  under
    article 8.  In  any  event,  the  appellant's  whole  family  lived  in
    Bangladesh and family life was entirely possible  there  especially  as
    the appellant had been in the United Kingdom for less than  two  years.
    Removal therefore would not breach their right to family life. He  also
    submitted there were no  "very  significant  difficulties"  facing  the
    appellant because although she understood limited Bengali the appellant
    did speak Bengali fluently. Whilst her family resided in  this  country
    she was an adult and had demonstrated she was not  dependent  on  them.
    Whilst she claimed she  looked  after  her  parents  there  were  other
    siblings, if necessary, who could carry out that role. With  regard  to
    private life Mr  Walker  submitted  there  were  no  "very  significant
    obstacles" facing the sponsor and appellant. Mr Walker adopted the same
    arguments he had put forward in respect of family  life  and  submitted
    that ultimately the sponsor would have to make a  decision  whether  to
    remain in the United Kingdom, if the appellant  wanted  to  pursue   an
    application under the Immigration Rules,  or  alternatively  she  could
    accompany him for a short time whilst he made his  application.  Whilst
    the sponsor would have difficulties relocating these difficulties  were
    the same any person relocating to foreign country would face.  None  of
    the reasons put forward were "very significant obstacles".


22. Mr Sultan relied on the bundle of documents that  had  previously  been
    submitted and argued that as the sponsor had lived here for  twenty-six
    years (since she was three years of age) and lived in the same area  as
    all her family and siblings there would  be  either  "very  significant
    difficulties" or "very significant obstacles" to her going to  live  in
    Bangladesh. The difficulties/obstacles included:

     a. She did not understand Bengali fluently.
     b. She had her own accommodation to pay for.
     c. She earned over �20,000 per annum.
     d. As the eldest child she was responsible for her parents and she had
        to take her father for regular check ups at the hospital.
     e. It would be both financially and practically difficult for  her  to
        go and live in Bangladesh and find employment.
     f. The sponsor was undertaking a course at university with a  view  to
        furthering her career.
     g. This was a genuine case and it was too heavy punishment to  require
        the appellant to leave the United Kingdom.
     h. It was very harsh for the sponsor to relocate to Bangladesh.

23. Mr Sultan concluded his submissions by stating that whilst individually
    the sponsor's problems may  not  amount  to  either  "very  significant
    difficulties" or "very significant obstacles", collectively  they  did.
    He invited me to allow the appeal.


24. I reserved my decision.

    FINDINGS ON APPLICATION UNDER THE IMMIGRATION RULES

25. I am dealing with an application under either Section EX.1 of  Appendix
    FM or paragraph 276ADE HC 395.  For  the  reasons  set  out  above  the
    appellant failed to satisfy the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM
    but succeeded before the Tribunal under article 8.


26. Section EX.1 allows the appellant to extend his  stay  without  meeting
    some of the other requirements but to  succeed  the  appellant  has  to
    demonstrate he is in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  and  there
    are  "insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  with  that   partner
    continuing  outside  the  UK."  Section  EX.2  defines  "insurmountable
    obstacles" to mean "very significant difficulties which would be  faced
    by the applicant or their  partner  in  continuing  their  family  life
    together outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would entail
    very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

27. The  Court  of  Appeal  in  Agyarko  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  440  considered
    "insurmountable obstacles and stated at paragraph [21]-


           "The phrase "insurmountable obstacles" as used in this paragraph
           of the Rules clearly imposes a high hurdle to be overcome by  an
           applicant for leave to remain  under  the  Rules.  The  test  is
           significantly more demanding than a  mere  test  of  whether  it
           would be reasonable to expect a couple to continue their  family
           life outside the United Kingdom."

28. The Court of Appeal went on  to  state  that  although  it  involved  a
    stringent test, it was obviously intended in both the case-law and  the
    Rules to be interpreted in a  sensible  and  practical  rather  than  a
    purely literal way but it was nevertheless a pre-condition that had  to
    be met. However, being a British citizen, living all of one's  life  in
    the United Kingdom and having a job would make life difficult  for  the
    sponsor to relocate to Bangladesh to continue their family life but  as
    the Court made clear in Agyarko  these  factors  could  not  constitute
    insurmountable obstacles.


29. I have considered the sponsor's recent statement in which she helpfully
    set out why she believed there would be  insurmountable  obstacles  but
    none of those factors set her apart from the  facts  as  considered  in
    Agyarko and whilst each case is fact sensitive there  is  nothing  that
    raises her case above the threshold test set out in  Section  EX.1.  On
    her own admission she and her siblings all live here. If she is  unable
    to assist with her father's medical trips then the responsibility would
    fall on one of her siblings-just as it would if she happened to be  ill
    herself or away on holiday. She may well be studying but  in  light  of
    the fact the respondent accepted the Tribunal had  allowed  the  appeal
    under article 8 on Chikwamba factors it seems to me that there would be
    no obstacle to the appellant and sponsor being apart.

30. I am satisfied there are no insurmountable obstacles that  would  merit
    allowing this appeal under Section EX.1 of Appendix FM.

31. I have also considered the appeal under paragraph 276ADE  HC  395.  The
    appellant has only been in the United Kingdom since August 2013 and  in
    light of his age he can only succeed if he can demonstrate there  would
    be very significant obstacles to his or the sponsor's integration  into
    the country to which they would have to go, if required  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom. In Bossadi (paragraph 276ADE; suitability; ties) [2015]
    UKUT 42 (IAC) it was held this assessment required a rounded assessment
    as to whether a person's familial ties could result in support.

32. The observations made above in relation Section EX.1 equally  apply  in
    this assessment although the test now is whether those factors amounted
    to  very  significant  obstacles  that  would  prevent  the   sponsor's
    integration into Bangladesh. The sponsor understands Bengali albeit  it
    is not her first language and if they chose  to  return  to  Bangladesh
    there is nothing to prevent them returning to live with the appellant's
    own family bearing in mind this was an arranged marriage.  There  would
    be problems over her work but sometimes choices have to be made when it
    comes to  marriage  and  I  repeat  the  respondent  has  accepted  the
    appellant has leave to remain under article 8 ECHR.


33. Although I have considered all of the above matters I am not  satisfied
    the appellant is entitled  to  remain  under  either  Section  EX.1  or
    paragraph 276ADE HC 395.

    DECISION


34. There was a material error. I set  aside  the  decision  to  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.


35. The Tribunal, for the reasons set out above,  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal under article 8 ECHR and in the circumstances  I  merely  affirm
    the Tribunal's decision as it was not wholly clear  from  the  decision
    itself.
