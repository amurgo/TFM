                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant obtained permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal  promulgated  on  3  July
    2015 dismissing his appeal on all grounds.

 2. By way of a letter dated  12  November  2015  the  appellant  seeks  to
    withdraw his case before the Upper Tribunal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing the terms of the First-tier Tribunal's decision,  I  give
    such consent to the appellant to withdraw.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of this is that the proceedings before  the  Upper  Tribunal
    are at an end. There is no appeal before the  Upper  Tribunal  and  the
    First-tier Tribunal's decision shall stand.
