                            DECISION AND REASONS

  Introduction and Background

 1. The appellant is a Tunisian citizen. She appeals against a decision  of
    judge  Doyle  (the  judge)  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   (the   FTT)
    promulgated on 31 August 2017.

 2. The appellant applied for permanent residence in the UK  on  the  basis
    that she is the spouse of an EEA national and had  resided  in  the  UK
    with her spouse in accordance with the  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations
    for a continuous period of five years. Her application was  refused  on
    14 June 2017.

 3. The appellant's solicitors lodged an appeal with the  FTT  on  29  June
    2017 but failed to provide grounds of appeal. On 17 July 2017  the  FTT
    directed the appellant and her solicitors to lodge grounds of appeal no
    later than 24 July 2017 and warned that failure to comply may result in
    the appeal being dismissed without a hearing.

 4. There was no response to the directions. On 30 August  2017  the  judge
    dismissed the appeal without a hearing because of a failure  to  comply
    with directions.

 5. On 14 September 2017 the appellant, through her solicitors, applied for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal. It was contended  that  the
    judge had materially erred in law by finding that no grounds of  appeal
    had been submitted. The solicitors contended that grounds of appeal had
    been submitted on 21 July 2017 and produced a copy of a letter dated 21
    July 2017 addressed to the FTT at the support centre in Leicester which
    referred to the grounds of appeal being enclosed.

 6. Permission to appeal was granted by judge Mailer of the FTT  who  found
    it arguable that there may  have  been  procedural  unfairness  if  the
    solicitors had submitted the grounds of appeal on 21 July  2017.  Judge
    Mailer commented  that  it  was  expected  that  evidence  showing  the
    documents were posted as alleged would be  produced  before  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 7. Permission to appeal was granted on 5 February 2018 but the appeal  was
    not listed until 18 January 2019. At the commencement of the hearing Mr
    Yusuf submitted evidence which he contended proved that the grounds had
    been sent by first-class post to the FTT on 21 July 2017.  I  expressed
    my surprise that this evidence had not  been  submitted  prior  to  the
    hearing. There was no satisfactory explanation for the late lodging  of
    this evidence.

 8. The evidence consisted of a statement dated 17  January  2019  made  by
    Qamar Akhtar a solicitor employed at Kingswood solicitors  since  2015.
    He confirmed that the grounds were posted on 21  July  2017.  Mr  Yusuf
    produced the outgoing post book used by the solicitors in  which  there
    was an entry dated 21 July 2017 referring to the appellant by name  and
    alongside the name was 'FTT- Court.'

 9. Mr Mills did not concede that the FTT decision should be set aside  but
    had no submissions to make.

My Conclusions and Reasons

10.  I am satisfied that the solicitors posted the grounds of appeal to the
    FTT on 21 July 2017. I am also satisfied that the  grounds  were  never
    received by the FTT until they was submitted with the  application  for
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on 14 September 2017.

11. I take into account the guidance in MM Sudan [2014]  UKUT  00105  (IAC)
    which confirms that where  there  is  a  defect  or  impropriety  of  a
    procedural nature in the proceedings at first instance, this may amount
    to a material error of law requiring the decision of the FTT to be  set
    aside. A successful appeal is not dependent  on  the  demonstration  of
    some failing on the part of the FTT.

12. The judge cannot be blamed for deciding the appeal without  a  hearing.
    There is no failing on the part of the FTT. However, as I  accept  that
    the  solicitors  did  post  the  grounds  of  appeal,  there  has  been
    unfairness and a procedural irregularity which amounts to an  error  of
    law. I therefore set aside the decision of the FTT.

13. I have taken into account  paragraph  7.2  of  the  Senior  President's
    Practice Statements  and  find  that  the  appellant  has  not  had  an
    opportunity for her case to be fairly considered by the FTT and  it  is
    therefore appropriate to remit this  appeal  back  to  the  FTT  to  be
    decided afresh.

14. The parties will be advised of the time and date of the hearing in  due
    course. The appeal is to be heard by an  FTT  judge  other  than  judge
    Doyle.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT is set aside. The appeal is allowed  to  the  extent
that it is remitted to the FTT to be heard afresh.

There has been no request for anonymity and no anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I make no fee award. The issue of any fee award will need to be  decided  by
    the FTT.
