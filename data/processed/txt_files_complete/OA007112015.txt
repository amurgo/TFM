                                   Between

                    THE ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICE, ISLAMABAD
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                  NASIR GUL


                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The respondent, whom I shall call "the claimant", appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal against the  decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    refusing him entry clearance as a partner.  Judge  Hawden-Beal  allowed
    his appeal.  On application the respondent was  granted  permission  to
    appeal to this Tribunal and accordingly the Tribunal stands  seised  of
    that appeal.


 2. The claimant's solicitors have written to the  Tribunal  narrating  the
    grant of entry clearance to the claimant and requesting  withdrawal  of
    "Mr Gul's appeal".

 3. The present appeal is, as noted above, by the Entry Clearance  Officer.
    As the claimant's solicitors must know, the provisions of  rule  17  of
    the Upper Tribunal Rules allow a party  to  withdraw  its  case  and  I
    assume that that is what they meant because there is nothing else  they
    could have been asking.

 4. I accept the withdrawal of the claimant's case.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's appeal is unresisted and I formally allow it.   There  is  no
    proper basis for saying that  the  grounds  are  without  merit  and  I
    substitute a decision dismissing the appeal against the Entry Clearance
    Officer's decision, although I note that there has now been a grant  of
    entry clearance, whether on the present or a subsequent application.
