For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who made  an  application  for
    leave to remain as the married partner of a Mr Uddin, a settled  person
    under Appendix FM and outside the Immigration Rules under Article 8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights. Her  application  was  refused
    and she appealed and in a decision promulgated  on  18  February  2019,
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal S L Farmer, dismissed the appeal  both
    under the Immigration Rules and on Article 8 grounds.

 2. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. This was  initially  refused
    but a renewed application to the Upper Tribunal was granted  by  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Mailer on 26 June 2019. His reasons for the  grant
    were: -

         "1.  The appellant is a national of  Bangladesh  born  on  20  June
         1988. She renews her  application  for  permission  to  appeal  the
         decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge who dismissed her  appeal
         against the respondent's decision to refuse to grant her  leave  to
         remain as the married partner of her spouse, a settled person.

         2.   It is arguable that there was  evidence  that  the  financial,
         English language and relationship requirements may have  been  met,
         and that in accordance with the decisions in Chikwamba and Agyarko,
         the Judge should have  considered  whether  in  the  circumstances,
         there was any public interest in the appellant's removal.

         3.   Permission to appeal is granted on all grounds."

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 4. At the outset of the hearing, I gave the parties some time. I was  then
    informed both representatives  accepted  that  the  financial,  English
    language and relationship requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  were
    met, but  the  outstanding  issue  remaining  was  the  fact  that  the
    Appellant had not had any valid leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    since 11 August 2016 and was therefore unable to meet the  requirements
    of E-LTRP 2.1 to 2.2.

 5. Mr Aslam relied upon the  grounds  seeking  permission  to  appeal.  He
    referred  me  to  paragraph  28  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's
    decision, where the Judge found that the  Appellant  can  continue  her
    family life abroad and can return to her country of origin to  make  an
    application from abroad. He submitted  that  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant can return to make an application, in circumstances where the
    financial and other requirements are met, and, as here, where there  is
    ongoing medical treatment, is contrary to the guidance in  Chikwamba  v
    SSHD [2008] UKHL 40. In particular, he relied upon paragraph 44 of that
    judgement which states:-

         "I am far from  suggesting  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should
         routinely apply this policy in all but exceptional cases. Rather it
         seems to me that only comparatively  rarely,  certainly  in  family
         cases involving children, should an article 8 appeal  be  dismissed
         on the basis that it would be proportionate  and  more  appropriate
         for the appellant to apply  for  leave  from  abroad.  Besides  the
         considerations already mentioned, it should be borne in  mind  that
         the 1999 Act introduced one-stop  appeals.  The  article  8  policy
         instruction is not easily reconcilable  with  the  new  streamlined
         approach. Where a single appeal combines (as often it does)  claims
         both for asylum and for leave to remain under article 3 or  article
         8, the appellate authorities  would  necessarily  have  to  dispose
         substantively of the asylum and  article  3  claims.  Suppose  that
         these fail. Should the article 8 claim then be dismissed so that it
         can be advanced abroad,  with  the  prospect  of  a  later,  second
         section 65 appeal if the claim  fails  before  the  ECO  (with  the
         disadvantage of the appellant  then  being  out  of  the  country)?
         Better surely that in most cases the article  8  claim  be  decided
         once and for all at the initial stage. If it is well-founded, leave
         should be granted. If not, it should be refused."



 6. Also, he relied on the authority  of  Agyarko  and  Ikuga,  R  (on  the
    applications of) v. SSHD [2017] UKSC 11 and in particular paragraph  51
    of that judgement which states:-

         "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is  entitled  to
         remain in the UK only temporarily,  however,  the  significance  of
         this consideration depends  on  what  the  outcome  of  immigration
         control might otherwise be. For  example,  if  an  applicant  would
         otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal, then the
         weight of the public interest in his or her removal will  generally
         be very considerable. If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if
         residing in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted
         leave to enter, at least if an application were made  from  outside
         the UK, then there might be  no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
         removal. The point is illustrated by the decision  in  Chikwamba  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department."


 7. Further, that where the financial, English  language  and  relationship
    requirements are met (although the Judge  failed  to  make  finding  in
    relation to these), there  is  no  public  interest  in  returning  the
    Appellant to her country of origin. The  Judge  fell  into  speculation
    when concluding that there were no  ongoing  health  problems  for  the
    Appellant. She has not been fully discharged from hospital.

 8. Mr Aslam also submitted that the Appellant had  always  been  dependent
    upon her husband's status. He applied for indefinite leave  to  remain,
    but this was refused as the Respondent  alleged  that  within  the  ETS
    process he had used deception. That decision was  subject  to  Judicial
    Review proceedings which were conceded by the Secretary  of  State  and
    the Appellant's husband was consequently granted  Indefinite  Leave  to
    Remain. It was that Judicial  Review  process,  brought  about  by  the
    Respondent's error, that resulted in this Appellant not having  section
    3C leave.

 9. Ms Fijiwala submitted that the Immigration Rules were not  met  and  it
    was,  therefore,  open  to  the  Judge  to  find  that  there  were  no
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  the   Appellant's   reintegration   into
    Bangladeshi society. The Judge was equally entitled  to  conclude  that
    there was nothing unjustifiably harsh in the Appellant returning to her
    country of origin. There is no reason why family life with her  husband
    could not continue in Bangladesh.

10. In granting permission to appeal, Deputy Judge of  the  Upper  Tribunal
    Mailer found it arguable that there was evidence  that  the  financial,
    English language and relationship requirements may have  been  met  and
    that accordingly, the Judge should have gone on to consider whether, in
    the circumstances, there was any public  interest  in  the  Appellant's
    removal. I find that the Judge did not do this.

11. Before me today, the Respondent recognised that the financial,  English
    language and  relationship  requirements  were  indeed  met.  In  these
    circumstances, the issue as to whether there is any public interest  in
    the Appellant's removal falls to be considered. I find  that  there  is
    none. I take account of the background evidence. The Appellant has some
    medical  issues  for  which  treatment  is   ongoing.   However,   more
    importantly, this is an Appellant who has always  been  dependent  upon
    the status of her husband's. He now has Indefinite Leave to Remain,  in
    circumstances where the Respondent, within Judicial Review proceedings,
    conceded the position in relation to an allegation that within the  ETS
    process deception was used. It was indeed the  Respondent's  own  error
    which resulted in the Appellant in these proceedings not having section
    3C leave. It is acknowledged at today's  hearing  that  the  financial,
    English language and relationship requirements are met and in  all  the
    circumstances  I  find  that  there  is  no  public  interest  in  this
    Appellant's removal to make her application from abroad.



Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside the decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make  a  whole  fee
award of �140 which has been paid or may be payable.
