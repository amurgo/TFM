Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr S Muquit, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer







                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Appellants, citizens of Pakistan.   The  first
    two named Appellants, Mr Nawaz and Mr Rehman (for the purpose  of  this
    determination "the Appellants") were respectively born  on  19  January
    1981 and 30 August 1982.  They made a combined application for leave to
    remain in the United Kingdom as Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrants  under
    the Points Based System and on 18 July  2013  their  applications  were
    refused and directions made for their removal under Section 47  of  the
    Immigration, Asylum Nationality Act 2006.  The third and  fourth  named
    Appellants are respectively the wife and infant son of Mr Nawaz  so  in
    effect their status in the United Kingdom is dependent on  the  outcome
    of his appeal.

2.   The applicants' applications were refused because  the  Respondent  was
    not satisfied that they met the requirements of paragraph 245DD of  the
    Immigration Rules and more particularly sub-paragraphs  (b),  (h),  (i)
    and (k).

3.   In  summary  the  Respondent  was  not  satisfied  on  the  balance  of
    probabilities that:

           . 245DD(h) - the Appellants genuinely  intended  to  invest  the
             money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in  their  business
             and that it was genuinely available to them and  would  remain
             available to them until such time as spent on the business;


           . 245DD(i)  -  in reaching  that  decision  the  Respondent  had
             taken  account  of  the  evidence  that  the  applicants   had
             submitted; the viability and credibility of the source of  the
             money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A; the viability  and
             credibility of  the  Appellants'  business  plans  etc;  their
             previous  education  and  business  experience,   and;   their
             immigration history and previous activity in the UK.


4.   I pause there, because at the outset of the hearing  before  me  on  25
    April 2014, Mr Saunders for the Respondent most helpfully  informed  me
    as follows:

         "I have looked at the renewed grounds and I make no concessions  on
         the law, but I do say in respect of ground (iii) that if your  file
         were to reveal the existence of evidence in respect of the  realism
         of the Appellants' business proposals  and  that  evidence  is  not
         reflected in the First-tier Tribunal's determination, that  it  may
         be that the correct method of disposal would be to give this matter
         another hearing before the First-tier Tribunal."

5.   In light of Mr Saunders' indication, I in fact checked all four of  the
    relevant files but regrettably could not find in any of them, the First-
    tier Judge's Record of Proceedings in order to investigate the matter.

6.   However Mr Muquit for the Appellants was known to this Tribunal and  to
    the Secretary of State as a respected Counsel and he confirmed that  he
    had drafted the renewed grounds and it is apparent  from  ground  (iii)
    that it was contended that the First-tier Judge did not take account of
    material evidence and had otherwise misdirected himself on the evidence
    presented and the requirements of the Rules insofar as they applied  to
    the Appellants when dismissing their appeal.  It was also claimed that:

         "Judge Edwards ignored factors set out  in  the  Immigration  Rules
         themselves as evidence of genuine intention such as the Appellants'
         immigration  history  and  educational  background;   whilst   also
         ignoring other considerations as set out in the grounds such as the
         existence of a  business  plan,  the  fact  that  A's  family  were
         involved in the same business,(The Appellants) proposed  to  invest
         in the UK; and had in fact answered all questions that were put  to
         them as to  their  proposed  business  at  the  hearing,  including
         questions such as how they would be breaking  the  cars,  how  they
         would separate the various oils and gases and parts, what  licences
         were required and how they were to be obtained.  (These)  were  all
         explained during the hearing which they could not have done without
         researching the area" [ Emphasis added].


7.   Mr Saunders most fairly informed me and  I  agreed,  that  in  that  Mr
    Muquit had represented the Appellants at the hearing before the  First-
    tier Tribunal and as a respected Counsel, there was no reason to  doubt
    the veracity of that claim as emphasised above.

8.   In the light of that concession there is really no need for  me  to  go
    into other aspects of the Respondent's decision that led to the refusal
    of the Appellants' applications.

9.   It is however important for the sake of completeness to  add,  that  at
    the hearing before me, (which of course was  for  the  purposes  of  my
    deciding whether or not  the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Judge
    disclosed an error or errors on  a  point  of  law  such  as  may  have
    materially affected the outcome of the appeal) I drew to  Mr  Saunders'
    attention, paragraphs 3 and 4 of Ground 1 of the  original  grounds  in
    support of the first application  for  permission  to  appeal  that  Mr
    Saunders regrettably did not have before him.  It would be as well  for
    the sake of completeness to set out the  relevant  passage  from  those
    paragraphs concerning this appeal:

         "3.  The FtT erred in rejecting A's claims as to  the  availability
             of the funds required for investment.


         4.   The FtJ states that the provenance  of  the  funds  and  their
             availability was not established 'to my satisfaction'.  Leaving
             aside the fact that the FtJ gives no reasons for his  own  lack
             of satisfaction, such an approach was in any event unlawful."

10.  Paragraph 4 of ground 1 then goes on to emphasise  the  basis  of  that
    contention.

11.   The  point  is,  that  when  one  looks  at  the  First-tier   Judge's
    determination, what is striking,  is  that  whilst  to  the  First-tier
    Judge's credit, he comprehensively set  out  the  relevant  Immigration
    Rules applicable to this case including the display of relevant Tables,
    that  under  the  sub-heading  "Evidence"  there  were  but  two  brief
    paragraphs in summary. Similarly, under the sub-heading  "Submissions",
    there were two even briefer  paragraphs  in  summary.  Under  the  sub-
    heading "Conclusions" there were four brief paragraphs,  the  first  of
    which recorded the onus and standard of proof required in these  cases.



12.  At paragraph 20 the First-tier Judge had this to say:

         "The provenance of the ï¿½200,000 said to be held  by  Mr  Hamid  in
        Pakistan is still not entirely clear to me.  It is said to  be  'in
        the business' done by the family in that country.  It has not  been
        established to my satisfaction that this is, in  fact,  spare  cash
        awaiting investment. "


    With great respect to the First-tier Judge and as agreed between myself
    and both parties' representatives, this was an  inadequate  reason  for
    reaching a conclusion as to the provenance of the  funds,  that  was  a
    matter that was central and therefore obviously highly material to  the
    outcome of this appeal.

   13.   Matters of concern do not end there because at paragraph 21 of  his
    determination the First-tier Judge continued as follows:

         "21. The business  plans  of  Mr  Rehman  and  Mr  Nawaz  are  also
             unsatisfactory.  Apart from looking at a few premises  in  the
             London area, they appear to have done very little to establish
             the business, by setting up a limited  company,  by  obtaining
             the necessary waste management  consents  and,  if  necessary,
             planning permission, even on an informal basis from the  local
             planning authority, obtaining quotes for  equipment,  and  the
             hiring of staff.  I do not accept the assurance  I  was  given
             that such staff are readily available from a Job  Centre.   In
             my judgment, this will all take far longer than six months."

14.  In that regard,  I  would  refer  to  paragraph  (ii)  of  the  renewed
    grounds, with which I concur, that stated as follows:

         "In any event, it is  a  fact  that  (as  contended  in  Ground  2,
         paragraph 6 to 12) Judge Edwards did not take account  of  material
         evidence  and  otherwise  misdirected  himself  on   the   evidence
         presented and the requirements of the rules so far as they  applied
         to (the Appellants) when dismissing their appeal.  Contrary to  the
         premises relied upon by Judge Edwards (a) (the Appellants) were not
         required to establish the business they proposed to invest  in  and
         (b) did not simply look at a  few  premises  in  manifesting  their
         intention to invest in their proposed business and (c) could not in
         fact do what Judge Edwards apparently expected  to  do  (and  Judge
         Edwards himself was not sure that they could either).   This  is  a
         very important  consideration.   They  could  not  enter  into  any
         contracts, obtain any premises, register a company  or  obtain  any
         licences without breaching their existing visa conditions."


15.  Further, the Judge's apparent finding that staff would not be  "readily
    available from a Job Centre" and that in any  event,  this  would  "all
    take far longer than six months" was not a matter based on evidence but
    purely on speculation.

16.  The Appellants' renewed  application  for  permission  to  appeal,  was
    successful when Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek considered  it  arguable
    that the First-tier Judge erred in concluding that the  Appellants  did
    not meet the relevant requirements of the Immigration Rules in terms of
    the availability and use of funds  and  in  relation  to  the  proposed
    business.  In consequence the UTJ concluded  that  there  was  arguable
    merit in the grounds "as to the Judge's consideration of the Rules  and
    his assessment of the evidence".

17.  Prior to the hearing before me and in a letter dated 9 April  2014  the
    Tribunal received the Respondent's Rule 24 response but in light of  Mr
    Saunders' most helpful and in my view realistic concession, there is no
    need for me to refer to that matter further.  It is in any event  right
    to say that the Rule 24 response letter, accepted that  in  respect  of
    other matters stated in the grounds of challenge that were said not  to
    have been considered by the Judge, the Secretary of State did not  have
    a Record of Proceedings and could not assess those grounds.

18.  I have to say,  that  having  carefully  read  the  First-tier  Judge's
    determination, that in common with the parties, I have been  struck  by
    the paucity of information as to the evidence given and the submissions
    made by the parties' respective representatives.

19.  For the above  reasons,  I  am  satisfied  that  not  only  were  brief
    explanations given by the First-tier Judge for his conclusions  on  the
    central issue on  which  this  appeal  was  determined  but  they  were
    inadequately reasoned. This is not a case where upon a reading  of  the
    determination as a whole,  the  Tribunal  can  readily  understand  the
    thought processes that the Judge employed in reaching his decision (see
    R (Iran) [2005] EWCA Civ 982)

20.  Whilst brevity has its place  in  the  writing  of  determinations,  it
    cannot  be  at  the  expense  of  clear  and  adequate  reasoning   and
    regrettably I have concluded that such was the case  in  terms  of  the
    First-tier Judge's determination in the present case.

21.  For the above reasons, there is no need for me to move on to   consider
    the merits or otherwise of other aspects of the grounds challenging the
    First-tier Judge's determination.  In view of the errors  of  law  that
    have  been  established,  it  follows  that  the   First-tier   Judge's
    determination cannot stand and must be set aside.

22.  The parties have agreed with me that in consequence of my findings,  it
    follows that there has been no satisfactory hearing of the substance of
    this appeal at all.

23.  The scheme of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007  does  not
    assign the function of primary fact-finding to the Upper Tribunal.   In
    such circumstances Section 12(2) of the TCE 2007 requires us  to  remit
    the case to the First-tier or re-make it ourselves.  For the reasons  I
    have given above, and  with  the  agreement  of  the  parties,  I  have
    concluded that the decision should be remitted to a First-tier Tribunal
    Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge J D L Edwards  to  determine
    the appeal afresh, with all issues at large, at Taylor House.

24.  For this purpose a hearing has been arranged for 31 July 2014.

25.  I am satisfied  that  there  are  highly  compelling  factors,  falling
    within paragraph 7.2(b) of the Senior  President's  Practice  Statement
    that the decision should not be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.   It  is
    clearly in the interests of justice that the appeal of  the  Appellants
    be heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal.

26.  For this purpose the hearing of the appeal at Taylor House on  31  July
    2014 for a substantive hearing will  have  a  time  estimate  of  three
    hours.  I am given to understand that the first two  named  Appellants,
    Mr Rehman and Mr Nawaz will be giving oral evidence  for  that  purpose
    and will not require the services of an interpreter.

Decision

27.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law such that their  decision  in  the
    present appeal should be set aside.   I  remit  the  re-making  of  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House, to be heard before a
    First-tier Tribunal Judge other than First-tier Tribunal Judge  J  D  L
    Edwards.

28.  No anonymity direction has been made.
