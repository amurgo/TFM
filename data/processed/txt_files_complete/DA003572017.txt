Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms R Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Miss R L Penfold instructed by Sonn MacMillan
Walker, Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  we  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting  the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the respondent (CNV).  A failure to comply  with
    this direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The respondent is a citizen of Romania who was born on 2 November 1992.
     He last entered the United Kingdom on 19 August 2004 as a dependant of
    his father who was already in the UK.  On  27  November  2006,  he  was
    granted limited leave to remain in the UK until 27 November 2011  as  a
    dependant of his father.  On 21 February 2007, he  was  issued  with  a
    registration certificate as a dependant of his father.

 3. On 27 November 2015, the respondent was convicted at the Taunton  Crown
    Court of possessing a class A controlled  drug  (namely  cocaine)  with
    intent  to  supply,  possessing  a  class  B  controlled  drug  (namely
    cannabis),  and   facilitating   the   acquisition/acquiring/possessing
    criminal property.   He  was  sentenced  to  a  term  of  three  years'
    imprisonment on the first count and  two  years'  imprisonment  to  run
    concurrently on the third count.  No separate penalty  was  imposed  on
    count two.

 4. On 10 February 2016, the respondent was notified by  the  Secretary  of
    State of her intention to make a deportation order against him  on  the
    grounds of public policy in accordance with the (then)  applicable  EEA
    Regulations,  namely  reg  13(3)(b)  and  reg  21  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  (SI  2006/1003  as  amended)
    ("the 2006 Regulations").

 5. On three occasions thereafter - 10 March 2016, 9 February  2017  and  3
    March 2017 - the respondent's representatives made submissions  on  his
    behalf against his deportation.

 6. On 21 June 2017, the Secretary of State  made  a  decision  to  make  a
    deportation order and remove the respondent on the  grounds  of  public
    policy under the (now  in  force)  reg  23(6)(b)  and  reg  27  of  the
    Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2016   (SI   2016/1052)   ("the   2016
    Regulations").

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The respondent appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.   Judge  M  A  Khan
    allowed his appeal.  Having considered the evidence, including  from  a
    number of witnesses and documents including a psychiatric report, Judge
    Khan concluded in para 42 of his decision that:

         "42. In the circumstances, on the evidence before me, I  find  that
             it has not been  established  that  the  appellant's  personal
             conduct represents a genuine and sufficiently  serious  threat
             affecting one of the  fundamental  interests  of  society,  in
             particular the public policy aspect upon which the  respondent
             has based her decision to make the deportation  order  against
             the appellant".

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 8. The Secretary of State sought, and was granted on 23 August 2017 by the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Scott-Baker), permission to  appeal  against
    Judge Khan's decision.

 9. The single ground of appeal is that Judge Khan erred in law by  failing
    to apply the correct Regulations.   The  grounds  contend  that,  as  a
    result of Schedule 6(5) to  the  2016  Regulations,  those  Regulations
    (rather than the 2006 Regulations which were  applied  by  Judge  Khan)
    applied in the respondent's appeal.  As  a  result,  it  is  contended,
    Judge Khan erred in law by failing to apply  Schedule  1  to  the  2016
    Regulations which sets  out  the  relevant  "considerations  of  public
    policy, public security and the fundamental interests of society etc."

Discussion

10. Before us, Ms Petterson who represented the Secretary of State accepted
    that the judge's factual findings were not challenged.   The  scope  of
    the Secretary of State's appeal was limited  to  the  ground  that  the
    judge had erred in law by  failing  to  apply  the  relevant  parts  of
    Schedule 1 to the 2016 Regulations, in particular as  set  out  in  the
    grounds at para 7(g) of Schedule 1 that:

         "The fundamental interests of society in the United Kingdom include
             -

         ....

         (g)  tackling offences likely to cause harm  to  society  where  an
             immediate or direct victim may be difficult  to  identify  but
             there is a wider societal harm (such as  offences  related  to
             the misuse of drugs or crime with a cross-border dimension  as
             mentioned in Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of
             the European Union); ..."

11. Ms Petterson, in response to a question from us, accepted that the 2016
    Regulations did not change the applicable EU  law  in  respect  of  the
    deportation of an EU national.  She accepted that what had to be  taken
    into account under the 2016 Regulations set out in Schedule 1  was  the
    same as had to be taken into account prior to those  Regulations  under
    EU law and the 2006 Regulations.  While she maintained the Secretary of
    State's  position  that,  in  not  applying  Schedule  1  of  the  2016
    Regulations, Judge Khan had erred in law, she accepted that  his  error
    was not material to the outcome of the respondent's appeal.

12. In the light of those submissions, we did not call on  Ms  Penfold  and
    indicated that the Secretary of State's appeal would be dismissed.

13. It was common ground  before  us  that  as  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision subject to appeal was made on 21 June 2017.   After  the  2016
    Regulations  came  into  force  on  1  February  2017,   the   relevant
    Regulations to be applied both by the Secretary of State and  by  Judge
    Khan on appeal were the  2016  Regulations.   That,  in  our  judgment,
    clearly follows from para 5 of Schedule 6(5) to the  2016  Regulations,
    in particular para 5(1) and (2) which it is unnecessary to set  out  in
    full.

14. We also accept that by virtue of reg 27(8), Judge Khan was required, in
    determining whether  the  respondent's  deportation  was  justified  on
    grounds of  public  policy  to:  "have  regard  to  the  considerations
    contained in  Schedule  1  (considerations  of  public  policy,  public
    security  and  fundamental  interests  of  society  etc.)".    We   are
    satisfied that Judge Khan did err in law in  failing  to  consider  the
    2016 Regulations.

15. However, Ms Petterson was unable to identify any relevant consideration
    in Schedule 1 which Judge Khan had  failed  to  take  into  account  in
    reaching his conclusion that the respondent's personal conduct did  not
    represent a genuine and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one  of
    the fundamental interests of society.  Ms Petterson accepted that  none
    of the judge's findings were challenged by the Secretary of  State.  At
    paras 38-42, Judge Khan considered the evidence, including relating  to
    the  respondent's  rehabilitation.   As  we  have  already  noted,   Ms
    Petterson accepted that the relevant considerations under EU  law  were
    not changed by the 2016 Regulations.  In those  circumstances,  we  are
    wholly unpersuaded that Judge Khan  failed  properly  to  consider  the
    relevant considerations under EU law even though he  made  no  specific
    reference to the 2016 Regulations, in particular Schedule  1  to  those
    Regulations.  His error was not, therefore, material  to  his  allowing
    the respondent's appeal - a conclusion accepted by Ms Petterson  before
    us.   Consequently, there is no proper basis to set  aside  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision which stands.

Decision

16. For these reasons,  the  Secretary  of  State's  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal is dismissed.

17. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to  allow  the  respondent's  appeal
    stands.
