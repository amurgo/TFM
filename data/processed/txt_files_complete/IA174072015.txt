Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a citizen of  Bangladesh,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  dated  27th
    April 2015 to refuse his application for leave to remain in the UK as a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant and for a biometric residence  permit.   Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Kennedy allowed the Appellant's  appeal  and
    the Secretary of State now appeals with permission to this Tribunal.

 3. The background to  this  appeal  is  that  on  6th  November  2009  the
    Appellant was granted leave to enter the  UK  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student until 22nd March 2011.  That leave to remain  was  extended  on
    three occasions until 30th January 2016  but  on  17th  July  2014  the
    Appellant's application for leave to remain on the basis of private  or
    family life was refused and on 9th December 2014 his leave to remain to
    the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student was curtailed so as to  expire  on
    10th February 2015.  On that date the Appellant made an application for
    further leave to remain as a Tier 2  (General)  Student  Migrant.   His
    application was refused because he was not awarded any points under the
    attributes Section of Appendix A for sponsorship because it was  stated
    that his prospective employment most closely corresponds to  occupation
    code 5434 on the UK Border Agency's Code of Practice for  Sponsors  and
    the Appellant does not qualify for a shortage occupation as his Sponsor
    offers a takeaway service and therefore does not meet the definition of
    a shortage occupation as set out  in  Appendix  K  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.

 4. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal the judge considered  the
    Immigration Rules and in particular the shortage  occupation  list  set
    out in Appendix K.  The judge  noted  that  5434  defined  chef  as  "a
    skilled chef where ... the job is not in either a fast foot  outlet,  a
    standard fare outlet, or an establishment  which  provides  a  takeaway
    service ...".  The judge examined photographs of the shop front of  the
    establishment where the Appellant works which is called  Raj  Pavilion,
    Indian Restaurant and Takeaway.  The judge considered the evidence  and
    found that the business:

         "Operated primarily as  an  Indian  restaurant  with  an  ancillary
         takeaway service.  It was an independent operation and not part  of
         a chain or franchise.  From the menu produced, I  also  found  that
         dishes were cooked to order  from  fresh  ingredients  rather  than
         being mass-produced or reheated".  [15]

 5. The judge noted at paragraph 16 that in making these  findings  he  had
    relied on evidence that was not before  the  decision  maker  and  that
    Section 85A(3) and (4) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act
    2002 indicate that his assessment had to be of the material before  the
    decision maker rather than a consideration of  new  material.   However
    the judge noted that the Presenting Officer did  not  raise  any  issue
    about the evidence presented at the hearing nor did she address this in
    her submission and, in any event, the  decision  maker  had  relied  on
    evidence from the Just-Eat website and  did  so  without  inviting  the
    Appellant to comment in response. The judge concluded that that failure
    would breach the duty on the Respondent to act  fairly  in  determining
    the application which would result in the decision being set  aside  on
    that ground.

 6. The judge went on to consider whether  the  fact  that  the  restaurant
    offers a takeaway  service  required  him  to  refuse  the  appeal  and
    accepted the submission of  the  Appellant's  representative  that  the
    context of reference to the takeaway service within  a  category  which
    also accepts fast food outlets and standard fare outlets with which  it
    is associated indicates that the exclusion is aimed at takeaway outlets
    rather than restaurants.  The judge found that the intention behind the
    Rule is to  grant  leave  only  where  a  chef  does  not  work  in  an
    establishment where his particular skills  as  a  chef  are  not  truly
    required.  The judge concluded that an establishment which  provides  a
    takeaway service is placed by the wording of  the  Rules  in  the  same
    category as a fast food outlet and a standard fare outlet  but  in  the
    present case the establishment operates primarily as a restaurant where
    the dishes are created and cooked by the resident chef and  where  they
    are prepared to order from  fresh  ingredients.   The  judge  therefore
    found the fact that there is an ancillary  takeaway  service  does  not
    prevent the Appellant's  job  from  meeting  the  requirements  of  the
    category in question and  allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

Error of Law

 7. I note that at paragraph 16 of his decision the judge  found  that  the
    failure of the Secretary of State to seek the Appellant's  comments  on
    the material relied on to make  the  decision  (the  Just  Eat  website
    information) breached the Secretary of  State's  duty  to  act  fairly.
    However, having found that the Secretary of State breached her duty  of
    fairness, apart from an assertion that the Presenting Officer  did  not
    object to him considering new evidence, the judge decided that he could
    go on to consider the new evidence before him and went on  to  consider
    that evidence in the context of his interpretation of  the  meaning  of
    the exception set out in 5434. In my view the judge erred in  going  on
    to consider the new evidence submitted at the hearing as that  evidence
    was not before the decision maker.

 8. Having gone on to consider the new evidence the  judge  considered  the
    wording of the definition of skilled chef in 5434.  Table 1 of Appendix
    K sets out the UK shortage occupation list. The relevant part  for  the
    purposes of this appeal is 5434 which states;

         "5434 Chefs


             Only the following job in this occupation code:


             Skilled chef where:


             the pay is at least ï¿½29,570  per  year  after  deductions  for
             accommodation, meals etc; and
             the job requires five or more years relevant experience  in  a
             role of at  least  equivalent  status  to  the  one  they  are
             entering; and
             the job is not in either a fast food outlet, a  standard  fare
             outlet,  or  an  establishment  which  provides  a   take-away
             service; and

             The job is in one of the following roles:
             executive chef - limited to one per establishment
             head chef - limited to one per establishment
             sous chef - limited to one for every four  kitchen  staff  per
             establishment
             specialist  chef  -  limited  to  one   per   speciality   per
             establishment

             A fast food outlet is one where food is prepared in  bulk  for
             speed of service, rather than to individual order.

             A standard fare outlet is  one  where  the  menu  is  designed
             centrally for outlets in a chain / franchise, rather than by a
             chef or chefs in  the  individual  restaurant.  Standard  fare
             outlets also include those  where  dishes  and  /  or  cooking
             sauces are bought in ready-made,  rather  than  prepared  from
             fresh / raw ingredients."

 9.  At  the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Avery  submitted  that  the  judge's
    interpretation was not open to him on the clear wording  of  the  Rule.
    He submitted that it is very clear that the Rule does  not  say  "only"
    provides a takeaway service and the judge has  not  given  the  obvious
    meaning  to  the  Rule.   He  therefore  submitted   that   the   judge
    misinterpreted the Rule.  He accepted this is a very narrow  issue  and
    there was no reason for going  on  beyond  ordinary  meaning.   In  his
    submissions Mr Sharma submitted that the only takeaway service  offered
    by this restaurant is through Just-Eat,  that  the  restaurant  is  the
    primary business and that there is an ancillary  takeaway  or  delivery
    service. He submitted that in his witness statement, which  was  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, the Appellant states that he is engaged in the
    restaurant side of the  business  and  is  not  a  takeaway  chef.   He
    submitted that the photos produced to the judge showed that  there  are
    two separate  entrances,  one  for  the  restaurant  and  one  for  the
    takeaway.

10. In his decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge interpreted  the  wording
    of 5434 of Appendix K by looking at the whole category, which  includes
    fast food outlets and standard fare  outlets  and  concluded  that  the
    exclusion is  aimed  at  take-away  outlets  rather  than  restaurants.
    Considering the context of the exceptions the  judge  found  that  "the
    intention behind the Rule is to grant leave only where a chef  (however
    apparently skilled or well paid) does  not  work  in  an  establishment
    where his particular skills as a chef are  not  truly  required"  [18].
    This led the judge to conclude that the exception does not apply  in  a
    case such as this where  the  establishment  operates  primarily  as  a
    restaurant and where the dishes are created and cooked by the  resident
    chef and where they are prepared to order from fresh ingredients.

11. I do not agree that the exception can be read in this way. I note  that
    there are definitions of fast food and standard fare restaurants  which
    emphasise  the  methods  of  food  preparation.  However  there  is  no
    definition of 'an establishment which provides a take-away service'. In
    my view this is because that phrase does not  need  definition  as  the
    meaning is clear and obvious from the  wording.  I  accept  Mr  Avery's
    submission that  the  word  'only'  is  not  there,  nor  is  the  word
    'ancillary' as inserted by the judge.  There is no guidance and no case
    law which would indicate that this interpretation can be added  to  the
    plain meaning of those words.  On the plain and ordinary meaning of the
    Rule a chef in a restaurant which provides a takeaway service is not  a
    'skilled chef' within the meaning of 5434 in Appendix K.

12. I therefore consider that the judge made material errors of law in  his
    consideration  of  evidence  submitted   at   the   hearing   and   his
    interpretation of the Rules and I set aside the decision of the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge.

Remaking the Decision

13. In terms of remaking the decision Mr Sharma submitted that the issue of
    the takeaway service and the evidence from Just-Eat  appeared  for  the
    first time in the Secretary of State's refusal  letter.   He  submitted
    that this meant that the Appellant had no opportunity  to  provide  any
    evidence to answer that  issue  and  he  should  have  been  given  the
    opportunity to do so in the interests of fairness.  He  relied  on  the
    case of Naved (Student - fairness - notice of points) [2012] UKUT 00014
    (IAC).  He submitted that the appeal should be allowed  to  the  extent
    that it is not in accordance with the law.  On the other hand Mr  Avery
    submitted that it is plain on the face  of  it  what  the  Rules  mean,
    therefore it should not have come as a surprise to the  Appellant  that
    the Secretary of State would take this issue.

14. I am persuaded by Mr Sharma's submissions in this regard. He  submitted
    that the employer's restaurant does  not  provide  a  direct  take-away
    service and that the availability of a delivery  service  through  Just
    Eat does not amount to a take-away service. There also  appears  to  be
    some dispute at to whether there are two separate premises side by side
    with two separate entrances one of which is a takeaway.  Whilst  I  did
    not examine any  evidence  as  to  whether  the  employer's  restaurant
    provides a takeaway service I accept that there appears to be a dispute
    as to this issue.  This goes directly to the issue at the heart of this
    appeal, whether the Appellant's employment is as a skilled chef  within
    occupation code 5434.

15. The difficulty here is that the issue  of  the  restaurant  offering  a
    takeaway service was raised for the  first  time  in  the  Reasons  for
    Refusal letter. The Upper Tribunal considered fairness in the  case  of
    Naved and gave the following guidance as summarised in the head note:

         "Fairness requires the Secretary of State to give an  applicant  an
         opportunity to address grounds for refusal, of  which  he  did  not
         know and could not have known, failing which the resulting decision
         may be set aside on appeal as contrary to law (without contravening
         the provisions of s. 85A of the Nationality, Asylum and Immigration
         Act 2002)."

16. The information on which the refusal was based in this case was a print
    out from Just Eat following an internet search. Given that there  is  a
    dispute as to the type  of  service  provided  by  the  restaurant  the
    Appellant should have an opportunity to  address  the  results  of  the
    internet research.

17. I therefore allow the appeal to the extent that it is not in accordance
    with the  law  and  the  application  remains  outstanding  before  the
    Secretary of  State  to  comply  with  the  duty  of  fairness  to  the
    Appellant.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains a  material  error  of  law
and I set it aside.

I remake the decision by allowing the appeal to the extent that  it  is  not
in accordance with the law.

No anonymity direction is made.
