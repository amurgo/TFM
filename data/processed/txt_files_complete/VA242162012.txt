Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs S Daley, instructed by Rochdale Law Centre
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Pakistan born  30  September  1950.  She
    appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against  a  decision  of  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer refusing  to  grant  her  entry  clearance  to  visit
    relatives in the United Kingdom.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ransley dismissed this appeal on all  grounds
    in a determination promulgated on the 5 February 2013.  Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Chalkley granted the appellant permission to appeal  on  10  July
    2013, and thus the appeal came before us.

 3. In her pleaded grounds the  appellant  submitted  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge erred in the following respects:

     i) by misdirecting herself in law by equating the  appellant's  desire
        with her intentions;

    ii) by failing to give reasons for her conclusion  that  the  appellant
        was 'not genuinely seeking entry as a visitor'

   iii) by failing to put the appellant on notice that she intended (i)  to
        conclude that the appellant had made false  representations  in  an
        earlier entry clearance application, and (ii) to treat such finding
        as adverse to the appellant's credibility;

    iv) by irrationally concluding, in paragraph 24 of  her  determination,
        that 'the appellant's intention should be informed by whether  this
        was her first application for a  visitor's  visa  after  previously
        seeking to settle in the UK"

 4. At the hearing Mrs Daley made submissions in support  of  the  grounds,
    drawing attention, as she did so,  to  passages  contained  within  the
    Court of Appeal's decision in A v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2010] EWCA Civ 773 and the Tribunal's reported decision  of
    AA and others  (Sectors  Based  Work:  general  principles)  Bangladesh
    [2006] UKAIT 00026.

 5. In response Mr  Jarvis  submitted  that  these  decisions  were  of  no
    assistance to the Tribunal, as each gave consideration to  a  different
    immigration rule, and to an entirely different  set  of  circumstances.
    He further asserted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had  given
    detailed reasons for her adverse credibility finding and those  reasons
    had been available to her given the  evidence  she  had  been  provided
    with. As to the claimed procedural unfairness,  he  observed  that  the
    appellant had been legally represented at the  hearing,  and  that  the
    legal representative had neither made an application for the  sponsor's
    evidence to be re-opened to deal with the issue  of  the  inconsistency
    nor sought an adjournment to obtain further evidence from the appellant
    in this regard.

 6. After having  considered  the  parties  submissions  we  announced  our
    decision that the First-tier Tribunal's determination did not contained
    an error on a point of law requiring it to be set aside.  We  now  give
    our reasons for that conclusion.

 7. In her Visa Application Form the appellant indicated  that  she  sought
    entry to the United Kingdom for a period of two  months  to  visit  her
    son. The Respondent refused this application having concluded that  the
    appellant had not established that (i) she was genuinely seeking  entry
    as a visitor for a period not exceeding six months, and (ii)  that  she
    intended to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the stated two month
    period. When doing  so  the  Respondent  identified  that  he  was  not
    satisfied with the accuracy of the appellant's  assertions  as  to  her
    financial circumstances in Pakistan. The refusal notice also highlights
    the fact that the  appellant  had  previous  made  an  application  for
    settlement in the United Kingdom, which had been refused,  as  had  the
    appeal against such decision.

 8. In her determination the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  correctly  directs
    herself to the  relevant  immigration  rule  [5],  the  decision  under
    challenge [7] and the applicable burden  and  standard  of  proof.  She
    provided reasons for concluding that the appellant  did  not  meet  the
    requirements if the Immigration Rules, within paragraphs 10  to  25  of
    the determination. In doing  so  she  observed  that  in  her  VAF  the
    appellant    stated    that    she    receives    no    income     from
    'employment/occupation' but that  she  does  receive  monies  from  her
    United Kingdom based son.  The  judge  then  directed  attention  to  a
    certificate from the appellant's former employers, which indicated both
    that the appellant ceased employment  in  January  2002  and  that  she
    receives a pension of Rs 10,425 per month [12].

 9. The appellant's son gave evidence before Judge Ransley, confirming that
    the appellant receives the  aforementioned  pension,  that  she  ceased
    employment in '2000 or 2002' and that he sends her ï¿½120 per month [13].



10. The judge then turned [18 to 20] to consider the determination  of  the
    Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Judge Pacey) of 8 April 2009  made  in
    relation to a decision to refuse to grant her settlement in the  UK  as
    the dependent relative of her son ('paragraph 317 appeal').  She  cited
    [18]  verbatim  from  paragraph  16  of  Judge  Pacey's  determination,
    recording submissions made by the appellant's  then  representative  to
    the effect that the appellant's only source of income was from her son.
    Judge Ransley subsequently concluded as follows in paragraph 22 of  her
    determination:

        "I find that untruths have been  told  by  the  Appellant  and  the
        Sponsor in the Appellant's paragraph 317 application/appeal in that
        the Appellant had failed to  disclose  that  after  retiring  as  a
        teacher in 2002  the  appellant  has  been  receiving  a  teacher's
        pension  of  Rs  10,425  per  month.  The  Appellant   made   false
        representations  by  claiming  that  she  was  wholly   financially
        dependent on her Sponsor-son in the UK  and  false  representations
        were made to the effect that the Appellant was living in  the  most
        exceptional compassionate circumstances in Pakistan."

11. Mrs Daley submitted [ground 3] that it was unfair of the judge to  come
    to  this  conclusion  without   putting   the   allegation   of   false
    representation to the sponsor, or appellant;  either  of  whom,  it  is
    said, may have been  able  to  provide  adequate  explanation  for  the
    apparent inconsistency.

12. We do not accept this submission. As we were reminded by Mr Jarvis, the
    appellant was legally represented before the First-tier Tribunal. It is
    obvious from even a cursory examination of Judge Pacey's  determination
    that it was the appellant's case in the paragraph 317 appeal  that  she
    was wholly reliant on the monies provided to her by her United  Kingdom
    based son. It is plain that the evidence before the Judge  Ransley  was
    in contradiction to this. The appellant's financial circumstances  were
    clearly put in issue in the ECO's decision  notice  and,  consequently,
    inconsistent evidence given in relation to  those  circumstances  would
    evidently be relevant to the Tribunal's determination.

13. Even if the relevance of the inconsistent evidence had not occurred  to
    the appellant's legal representative at the point  in  the  proceedings
    when the sponsor was giving evidence,  it  was  a  matter  specifically
    relied upon by the Respondent's representative during the course of his
    closing submissions [see paragraph 21 of the determination].

14. It is matter for the appellant and her legal  representatives  how  she
    conducts  her  case.  Despite  the  evident  inconsistency,   and   the
    respondent's submissions made in regard to it,  the  appellant's  legal
    representative made no application to recall the sponsor in an  attempt
    to proffer an explanation; neither was an adjournment sought  in  order
    for evidence to be obtained from the appellant in this regard. The onus
    to apply for an adjournment or recall the sponsor  to  give  additional
    evidence was on the appellant's legal  representative.  The  judge  was
    entitled to take the point against the appellant and in  doing  so  did
    not act in breach of the principles natural justice.

15. Mrs Daley's reliance in this regard on the decision of A is  misplaced.
    A was a decision of the Court of Appeal made in relation to  paragraphs
    322(1A), with reference to paragraph 320(7A), of the Immigration Rules,
    and involved a detailed consideration of the meaning of the term 'false
    representations'. Judge Ransley was not considering  the  applicability
    of either of these rules, but rather assessing the reliability  of  the
    appellant's evidence, and the credibility of her stated intentions.  In
    doing so she was, in our conclusion, entitled to  rely  upon  the  fact
    that the appellant  had  given  inconsistent  evidence  in  an  earlier
    application; evidence which appeared to suit her needs at that time but
    no longer does so.

16. In any event, the appellant, and  her  representatives,  have  now  had
    ample  opportunity  to  provide  an  explanation  in  relation  to  the
    aforementioned  inconsistency,  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal having been  promulgated  nearly  7  months  ago.  There  has,
    however,  been  no  additional  evidence  provided  in   this   regard.
    Consequently, even had we concluded that the  First-tier  Tribunal  had
    erred in placing weight on  the  inconsistency  without  providing  the
    appellant or sponsor  an  opportunity  to  provide  an  explanation  in
    relation to it, such error would not have led us to set aside the First-
    tier Tribunal's determination; there being no such  explanation  before
    us.

17. Turning back to the first of the appellant's pleaded grounds, we do not
    accept that the judge  equated  the  appellant's  intentions  with  her
    desire.  It is plain that just because a person desires to live in  the
    United Kingdom permanently this does not follow that such  person  does
    not have an intention to leave the United Kingdom at the end of a grant
    of limited leave.

18. Judge Ransley was fully aware that it was  the  appellant's  intentions
    that were at issue [see paragraphs 11 and 25 of the determination].  In
    paragraph 24 the Judge was concluding no more  than  it  was  both  the
    appellant's desire and her intention to live permanently in the  United
    Kingdom  with  her  son,  for  reasons  she   gave   earlier   in   her
    determination.

19. As to the second of the appellant's grounds, the  judge's  reasons  for
    concluding that the appellant did not genuinely  intend  to  visit  the
    United Kingdom for the stated two month period [22 - 25] were of  equal
    application to her decision made in relation to paragraph 41(i) of  the
    Rules.

20. Finally, we do not accept that the First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  the
    manner claimed in the fourth of the appellant's grounds. The First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was entitled to take into account, when determining  the
    relevance of the fact of appellant's  previous  visits  to  the  United
    Kingdom, that, unlike the instant application, all of these visits  had
    taken place prior to the appellant's application for  settlement.  This
    was particularly relevant given the judge's finding that the  appellant
    had been untruthful in her attempts to gain settlement here.

21. Looked at as a whole, the reasons  given  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge for dismissing the  appellant's  appeal  are  clear,  cogent  and
    rational. She did not take into account matters of irrelevance and  did
    not fail to take into account relevant facts. Her conclusions were open
    to her on the available evidence.

22. For these reasons we find that the First-tier Tribunal's decision  does
    not contain an error on a point of law and it is to remain standing.

Decision

For the reasons given above we find that the  determination  of  the  First-
tier Tribunal does not contain an error on a  point  of  law  such  that  it
ought to be set  aside.   The  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  is  to
remain standing.
