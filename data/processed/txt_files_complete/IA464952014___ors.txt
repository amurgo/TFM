For the appellants:    Mr C Harris, instructed by Binas Solicitors
For the respondent:    Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appellants' linked appeals against the decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Lloyd-Smith promulgated  2.2.15,  dismissing  their
    appeals against  the  decisions  of  the  respondent  to  refuse  their
    applications for leave to remain in the UK on the basis of family life,
    and to remove them from the UK as illegal entrants pursuant to  section
    10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  The Judge heard the  appeal
    on 27.1.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cox granted permission to appeal on 7.4.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 20.5.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. At the appeal hearing before me I found no material error of law in the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Lloyd-Smith  should  be  set  aside.  I  reserved  my
    reasons, which I now give.

 5. In summary, the three grounds of appeal are that (1) the judge  applied
    the wrong 276ADE test; (2), which is really the same ground,  that  the
    judge failed to take material matters into account,  which  would  have
    demonstrated very significant obstacles; and (3) that the  judge  erred
    in the article 8 assessment,  requiring  compelling  circumstances,  in
    error failing to consider that the family  could  not  return  together
    because the spouse could not establish his Senegalese nationality;  and
    ignoring the circumstances the appellants would face in  Senegal,  even
    though not amounting to a valid asylum claim.

 6. For the reasons set out below, whilst there were some  errors,  I  find
    them not material to the outcome of the appeal. When  looked  at  as  a
    whole, on the facts of this case in the round, the conclusions  of  the
    judge that the appellants neither met the requirements of the Rules nor
    was their  removal  disproportionate  were  entirely  sustainable  with
    cogent reasons, rational and cannot be described as perverse. I am  not
    satisfied that such matters urged on me by Mr Harris as are relevant or
    material would or could have made any difference to the outcome of  the
    appeals, they would still have been dismissed. I find that much of  the
    grounds of appeal amount to  no  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the
    findings of the judge, for which cogent reasoning has been provided.

 7. I accept that Judge Lloyd-Smith erred in applying the  old  version  of
    paragraph 276ADE. In granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  Cox  noted
    that the judge applied the  old  'lost  ties'  test  rather  the  'very
    significant obstacles' test under paragraph 276ADE, causing  Judge  Cox
    to be "just persuaded that the error was arguably material,  given  the
    principal A's past difficulties. If they had  been  factored  into  the
    276ADE analysis, the result might arguably have been different."

 8. The Rule 24 response, dated 13.4.15, accepts that the judge applied  an
    outdated version of paragraph 276ADE, but it is submitted that  on  the
    material findings of fact it is clear  that  there  would  be  no  very
    significant obstacles to integration into Senegal. I  agree  with  that
    submission. I find that the appellants have failed to demonstrate  that
    application of the very significant obstacles test would have  resulted
    in the appeals being allowed under 276ADE. Whilst  there  may  be  some
    challenges or difficulties in returning, nothing in the  matters  urged
    upon me could amount to very significant difficulties,  such  that  the
    failure of the judge to apply that test would or could have produced  a
    different outcome. In particular, the appellants are all Senegalese and
    associated with the Senegalese community in the UK; it  is  clear  that
    cultural links have been retained. The judge also  rejected  the  claim
    that they had no family support in Senegal. The findings at �20  remain
    relevant and material to 'very significant obstacles':  that  the  main
    appellant has not been absent form Senegal for such a period as to lose
    all ties there with family and friends,  where  she  was  educated  and
    would, in the judge's view, be in a position  to  re-establish  herself
    and obtain employment. Once the asylum issues, not  relied  on  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal, are taken out of the equation, there was  no  real
    reason why the appellants could not and should not return  to  Senegal.
    None of the appellants are British and the children have no entitlement
    to education or other benefits of the  UK.  Their  best  interests  are
    undoubtedly to remain with their parents.

 9. I was not impressed with the argument that the spouse would  be  unable
    to return to Senegal because he allegedly had no means to establish his
    Sengalese nationality. He has no status and no right to remain  in  the
    UK. He was raised and educated in Senegal and the bare  assertion  that
    the  authorities  would  not  recognise  him  as  Senegalese  does  not
    demonstrate that he would not be able to return, either to  Senegal  or
    some other third country where they could enjoy family life.

10. In granting permission  to  appeal  Judge  Cox  noted  that  ground  3,
    criticising the article 8 proportionality assessment was  "weaker"  but
    found that the some of the points  made,  such  as  whether  the  judge
    required there to be compelling circumstances, were immaterial  because
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge went on in  any  event  to  make  a  full
    article 8 ECHR proportionality assessment.

11. I note, from  �19  of  the  decision  that  the  judge  considered  the
    objective material relied on by the appellants as to the dangers  young
    girls may face in Senegal,  but  it  was  accepted  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing that these matters would not amount to a  valid
    asylum claim as a well-founded fear of persecution or mistreatment. The
    judge was, in effect, asked not to take that  issue  into  account.  In
    raising them in the appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal,  Mr  Harris  is  in
    effect asking the Tribunal to use  article  8  as  a  back-door  asylum
    route, even though they would not meet the lower standard of proof of a
    well-founded fear of persecution or represent a real  likelihood  of  a
    risk of serious harm.

12. I also note that the judge failed to consider section 117B of the  2002
    Act as part of the article 8 assessment. In respect of  this  issue  Mr
    Harris was silent, but I find that it would not only not have  assisted
    the  appellants,  but  in   fact   highlighted   in   the   article   8
    proportionality assessment the strength of the public interest in their
    removal, particularly in the light of the recent decision of AM (s117B)
    Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC), where it was held that an appellant  can
    gain no positive right to a grant  of  leave  to  remain  from  section
    117B(2) or (3)  regarding  English  language  fluency  or  strength  of
    financial resources. Further, under section 117B little  weight  should
    be accorded to any private life developed in the UK whilst  a  person's
    immigration status is precarious, which is defined for  even  a  person
    with leave as being contingent on obtaining further grant of  leave  to
    remain. As the judge  noted  at  �5  of  the  decision,  the  principal
    appellant came to the UK as a family visitor in  2003,  but  since  the
    expiry of her 6 months leave has  remained  in  the  UK  illegally  and
    making no attempt to regularise her  immigration  status  for  over  10
    years. During this time she embarked on  a  relationship  with  another
    Senegalese national with no legal status in the UK and went through  an
    Islamic form of marriage in 2007, and proceeded to have two children, 6
    and 3 years of age at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing.  The
    appellant and her partner could have had no legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to remain in the UK at all; their situation  was  precarious
    and unlawful. Neither they nor their children have any legitimate claim
    to continuing private or family life in the UK. By  reason  of  section
    117B little weight should be given to a relationship with a partner  in
    any proportionality balancing  exercise  when  considering  the  public
    interest in the removal of the appellants. For these  reasons,  I  find
    that notwithstanding the matters urged on me by Mr Harris in respect of
    the article 8 assessment, on the facts of  this  case,  the  inevitable
    outcome of the proportionality assessment was and would continue to  be
    that removal was proportionate. To that extent, there  is  no  material
    error in the article 8 assessment. This was a very weak claim for leave
    to remain on grounds of private or family life and I am satisfied  that
    it was one with no prospect of success, regardless of the matters urged
    on me by Mr Harris.

Conclusions:

13. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeals  of  each  appellant  remain  dismissed  on  all
                    grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeals have been dismissed  and  thus  there  can  be  no  fee
award.
