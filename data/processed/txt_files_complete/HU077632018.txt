                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Tan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by Mamoon Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Whilst the respondent is the appellant in these proceedings before me,
    I hereafter refer to the parties using terminology used in the First-
    tier Tribunal.  The appellant in the First-tier Tribunal will hereafter
    be referred to as "the appellant" in these proceedings, and the
    respondent will be referred to as "the respondent".


 2. The appellant, a Pakistani national, who entered the United Kingdom as
    a student on May 21, 2007. She was subsequently granted leave to remain
    as a Tier 1 (Post Study) Migrant until August 11, 2011. She applied for
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on February 2, 2011 but
    this was refused by the respondent. She re-applied on April 4, 2011 and
    was granted leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant until June
    20, 2013 but this was subsequently extended until July 16, 2016.

 3. On July 14, 2016 she applied for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1
    (General) Migrant but before the application was considered she sought
    to vary that application on May 24, 2017 when she applied for
    indefinite leave to remain under 276B HC 395 on the grounds of long
    residence. The respondent refused this application on March 20, 2018
    under paragraph 322(5) HC 395 and paragraph 276ADE HC 395.


 4. The appellant appealed that decision on March 28, 2018 under section
    82(1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

 5. Her appeal was heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Mather on
    August 20, 2018 and in a decision promulgated on August 31, 2018 she
    allowed the appellant's appeal finding that the refusal under paragraph
    322(5) HC 395 was not made out and that as the appellant satisfied the
    requirements of paragraph 276B HC 395 she should succeed under article
    8 ECHR.

 6. Grounds of appeal were lodged on September 10, 2018 by the respondent
    in which it was argued that the Judge had materially erred because
    accepting her explanation that it was her accountant's fault.

 7. Permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Andrew on September 21, 2018 but Upper Tribunal Judge Kekic
    granted permission on all grounds finding it arguable the Judge's
    decision was flawed.

 8. A Rule 24 response dated February 26, 2019 submits that following the
    guidance in R (Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5))
    [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC) the Judge's approach could not be faulted.

 9. No anonymity order is made.

    SUBMISSIONS

10. Mr Tan adopted the grounds of appeal and submitted the Judge  erred  by
    simply accepting the appellant's explanation without more  evidence  to
    support her claim. The appellant had produced nothing from the previous
    accountants nor evidence from HMRC about what view, if any, they had of
    the understated income declarations. There was  no  evidence  that  the
    appellant had made any attempt to find out from the previous accountant
    why the figures were so wrong. Whilst her accountants stated  they  had
    filed updated accounts the Judge approached the assessment incorrectly.
    There was limited evidence from her current accountants  in  the  sense
    there was only one letter. At page G3 there was evidence the  appellant
    had been aware of a previous problem for tax  year  2012/2013  and  the
    Judge failed to consider this point or consider why the  appellant  had
    not queried the 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 tax returns at that time. There
    was, he submitted, an acceptance of the appellant's explanation without
    having  regard  to  factors  the  Tribunal  in  Khan  said  should   be
    considered.

11. Mr Ahmed adopted his skeleton argument and submitted  the  respondent's
    submissions amounted to a mere disagreement. The  only  issue  in  this
    appeal was whether para 322(5) HC 395 was engaged. The  Judge  had  the
    letter from accountants at page 21 of the appellant's  bundle  and  the
    refusal letter. At para 14 of her  decision,  the  Judge  set  out  the
    appellant's claim and recorded the appellant stated she had not  signed
    the returns and had not seen them. When she received the refusal letter
    she took action. The accountants had to obtain the evidence and  having
    done so filed amended tax returns. Due to  the  shortness  of  time  no
    further evidence obtained from the previous  accountant  and  HMRC.  At
    para 24 the Judge found no deception or dishonesty on the part  of  the
    appellant. He invited the Tribunal to uphold the decision.

12. I reserved my decision.

    FINDINGS

13. The  appellant  had  applied  for  indefinite  leave  to  remain  under
    paragraph 276B HC 395 albeit this was  an  amendment  to  her  original
    application.  Having  varied  her  application  on  May  24,  2017  the
    respondent sent her representatives a tax questionnaire on October  27,
    2017 which was responded to on November 23, 2017. Based on her answers,
    checks were  made  with  HMRC  and  against  her  previous  immigration
    applications. The respondent noted there was a discrepancy between what
    she  had  disclosed  to  HMRC  and  what  had  been  disclosed  to  the
    respondent.

14. On her HMRC tax return she declared a net income  from  self-employment
    of �10,449 for 2009/2010. For the tax year 2010/2011 she declared a net
    income of �6,249 giving a total self-employed income for  2009-2011  of
    �16,743. However, on Application form dated  April  4,  2011  for  Tier
    1(General) Migrant she declared her income as �45,123.42.

15. The respondent refused the application under paragraph 322(5) HC 395 on
    March 20, 2018 giving reasons for that decision.

16. By the time the appeal came before the Judge Mather, the appellant  had
    engaged accountants who wrote a letter dated July  27,  2018.  In  that
    letter they advised that the appellant had told them the  HMRC  records
    did not reflect her self-assessment earnings and that she had tried  to
    contact her previous accountant but had been unable to reach them. They
    had obtained copies of her returns and had filed revised  tax  returns.
    In her witness statement dated August 1, 2018 the appellant stated  she
    never saw the relevant tax returns and she accepted she  was  negligent
    in not asking for copies. She denied any dishonesty.

17. At the original hearing the appellant had adopted her statement and  it
    was submitted in her  behalf  that  as  she  had  not  been  dishonest,
    paragraph 322(5) HC 395 was not made out. At  paragraph  19  the  Judge
    stated, "Given the actions taken by the appellant and her  accountants,
    I am not persuaded the appellant did not make an  innocent  mistake  in
    her application of April 4, 2011".

18. At the date this appeal was heard the Tribunal had not handed down  the
    guidance in Khan but the principles would still apply.

19. The Tribunal in Khan provided guidance on how courts should  deal  with
    cases such as these and whilst that case is a  Judicial  Review  appeal
    nevertheless the guidance issued is of assistance. The Tribunal  should
    consider the following:

      a) Where there has been a significant difference  between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  I would expect the Secretary of State  to  draw
         that inference where there is  no  plausible  explanation  for  the
         discrepancy.

      b) However, where an Applicant has presented evidence  to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented with a fact-
         finding task: she must decide whether the explanation and  evidence
         is sufficient, in her view, to displace the prima  facie  inference
         of deceit/dishonesty.

      c) In approaching that  fact-finding  task,  the  Secretary  of  State
         should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is  the
         "balance  of  probability",  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.

      d) However, for an applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
         an "error" in relation to the historical tax return will not be the
         end of the matter: far from it.  Thus, the Secretary  of  State  is
         entitled to take into account that, even where  an  accountant  has
         made an error, the accountant will or should  have  asked  the  tax
         payer to confirm that the return was accurate and  to  have  signed
         the tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will  have  known  of
         his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.  If,
         realising this (or wilfully shutting his eyes  to  the  situation),
         the Applicant has not taken  steps  within  a  reasonable  time  to
         remedy the situation, the Secretary of State  may  be  entitled  to
         conclude either that the error was not  simply  the  fault  of  the
         accountant or, alternatively, the Applicant's failure to remedy the
         situation itself justifies a conclusion that he has been  has  been
         deceitful or dishonest and  therefore  he  should  be  refused  ILR
         within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.

      e) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to  a  tax
         return has been dishonest or  merely  careless,  the  Secretary  of
         State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
         direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference
         to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the  reasoning
         is rational and the evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.

      f) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary  of  State  to
         consider in reaching her decision in these  cases,  including  (but
         these are by no means exclusive):

          i) Whether the explanation for the error  by  the  accountant  is
             plausible;

         ii) Whether the documentation which can be assumed to  exist  (for
             example,  correspondence  between  the   Applicant   and   his
             accountant at the time of the tax return) has  been  disclosed
             or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

        iii) Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had been  made
             because his liability to pay tax was less than he should  have
             expected;

         iv) Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken steps to remedy
             the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken and  the
             explanation for any significant delay.

      g) In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary of State  is
         likely to want to see evidence which goes  beyond  mere  assertion:
         for example, in a case such as the present where the explanation is
         that the Applicant was distracted by  his  concern  for  his  son's
         health, there should be documentary evidence about the matter.   If
         there is, then the Secretary  of  State  would  need  to  weigh  up
         whether such concern genuinely excuses or explains the  failure  to
         account for tax, or at  least  displaces  the  inference  that  the
         Applicant has been deceitful/dishonest.  The  Secretary  of  State,
         before making her decision, should call for the evidence which  she
         considers ought to exist, and may draw  an  unfavourable  inference
         from any failure on the part of the Applicant to produce it.

      h) In her decision, the  Secretary  of  State  should  articulate  her
         reasoning, setting out the matters which she has taken into account
         in reaching her decision and stating the reasons for  the  decision
         she has reached.

20. Mr Ahmed argued  that  the  Judge  did  unwittingly  follow  the  above
    guidance, but I cannot agree with that submission. The Tribunal made it
    clear that a statement from the appellant that it was the  accountant's
    fault is not enough. It was incumbent on  the  Judge  to  enquire  what
    steps had actually been taken  to  support  her  explanation.  In  this
    appeal  there  was  no  written  evidence  from  either  the   previous
    accountant or HMRC. These documents were of importance in circumstances
    where the understated income was in excess of �27,000. The Tribunal  in
    Khan made clear that the Tribunal must look behind the assertion and  I
    am satisfied that this was not done.  The  appellant  had  amended  her
    2012/2013 tax return so clearly she  had  some  knowledge  of  her  tax
    affairs as long ago as 2016.

21. The Judge did not have the benefit  of  having  the  decision  of  Khan
    before her and I have to  say  the  practice  of  including  unreported
    decisions in the bundle was also unhelpful.

22. The respondent was entitled to find there was  dishonesty  and  it  was
    then  the  responsibility  of  the  appellant   to   place   sufficient
    information before the  respondent  and  Judge  to  raise  a  plausible
    explanation. In allowing the appeal as she  did  the  Judge  fell  into
    error and in such circumstances, I set aside the decision.

23. Oral evidence and further documentary evidence is needed in this appeal
    and I therefore remit the matter back to the First-tier Tribunal for  a
    hearing before a Judge other than  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Mather. I remit the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under
    section 12(1) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

Notice of Decision

There is an error in law.  I set aside the original decision and  remit  the
matter  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(1)  of   the
Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.
