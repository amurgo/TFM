                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State I will refer to
       the parties as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.

    2. The appellant is a citizen of India born on 15th October  1982.   He
       arrived in the UK on 15th June 2010 as a Tier  4  student,  and  had
       leave in that capacity until he switched to permission to remain  as
       a Tier 1 post-study work migrant. His leave as a Tier  1  post-study
       work migrant expired on 9th  August  2014.  On  14th  July  2014  he
       applied for leave to remain as a Tier 1 entrepreneur  migrant.  This
       was refused on 4th September 2014. His appeal against  the  decision
       to refuse was allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Landes,  to  the
       extent it was remitted to  the  Secretary  of  State  for  a  lawful
       decision, in a determination promulgated on the 22nd December  2014.



    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal
       Simpson on 11th February 2015 on the basis that it was arguable that
       the First-tier judge had erred in law as the appeal should have been
       treated as abandoned as the  appellant  had  left  the  UK  on  17th
       December 2014, although the Tribunal was unaware of this fact.

    4. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law

Submissions

    5. The appellant did not attend the hearing, and neither did his  legal
       representative AM Legal Consultants UK Ltd. I was satisfied that  it
       was appropriate to proceed with the appeal as the notice of  hearing
       had been served on the appellant and  his  representative  by  first
       class post at their correct addresses on 11th March 2015.

    6. Ms Isherwood relied upon the grounds of appeal  which  contend  that
       the appeal should have been treated as abandoned under  s.104(4)  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  as  the  appellant
       had left the UK prior to the appeal being  finally  determined.  She
       also produced the Home Office computer record which showed that they
       had logged the appellant as having made  a  voluntary  departure  on
       17th December 2014.

    7. I indicated to Ms Isherwood that I accepted that  this  was  correct
       although I considered the appeal pointless as the appellant had made
       a departure and taken his passport from the Home Office, which meant
       his application was treated as withdrawn under paragraph 34J of  the
       Immigration Rules so no further action was required on the  part  of
       the Secretary of State.

Conclusions

    8. I find that the appellant left the UK on 17th December  2014,  which
       was  five  days  before  the  determination  of  Judge  Landes   was
       promulgated and thus finally determined.

    9. The Tribunal was unaware of this fact, however under s.92(8) of  the
       Nationality, Immigration Act 2002 (this is the  correct  section  of
       the 2002 Act since 20th October 2014)  if  an  appellant  brings  an
       appeal whilst in the UK and then leaves prior to  it  being  finally
       determined it is to be treated  as  abandoned  unless  it  has  been
       certified under s.94 or s.94B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  Act
       2002. This appeal had not been certified and  thus  it  should  have
       been treated as abandoned and not have been determined.


          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. I do not re-make the decision as the appeal is treated as abandoned.



Signed:                                            Date:  14th April 2015
