For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal brought the Appellant against the decision  of  Judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal Brown  dated  14  August  2015  following  a
    hearing at Taylor House on 21 July 2015.  The Appellant is  a  national
    of Nigeria who applied for entry clearance under  Section  EC-P:  Entry
    clearance as a partner in Appendix FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    relying on Article 8  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
    seeking to join her husband, the sponsor, Mr  Isa  Awolaja,  a  British
    national of Nigerian  origin.   Mr  Awolaja  is  a  man  in  his  early
    seventies and has been in recent employment.

2.   In a decision dated 2 October 2014 Respondent refused  entry  clearance
    for a  number  of  reasons.   It  was  noted  that  the  Appellant  had
    previously entered the United Kingdom on  7  October  2005  with  entry
    clearance as a visitor, and had overstayed, remaining until removed  on
    27 June 2011. The Respondent referred to  a  number  of  other  factors
    which were deemed to be adverse, and invoked the provision of paragraph
    320(11) of the Immigration Rules, refusing entry clearance on the basis
    that  the  Appellant  had  significantly  contrived  to  frustrate  the
    intentions  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  there  were   aggravating
    circumstances.

3.   I do not need to set out the particulars of those  alleged  aggravating
    circumstances, because on appeal the Appellant  and  her  husband,  the
    Sponsor, were successful in persuading the judge that this was  not  an
    appropriate case in which the provision  of  paragraph  320(11)  should
    have been invoked.

4.   However there had been other reasons relied upon by the Respondent  for
    refusing the application; principally that the  financial  requirements
    of Appendix FM were not satisfied. It was noted that the Sponsor had an
    income of �9,520.99.  The  Respondent  identified  that  part  of  that
    income was made up of pension credits  which  the  Respondent  asserted
    were not entitled to be treated as income for the purposes of  Appendix
    FM or Appendix FM-SE.  There was therefore a further shortfall  in  the
    Sponsor's income.

5.   Whilst the Sponsor had savings, these did not add up to  two-and-a-half
    times the difference between the  Sponsor's  income  and  the  relevant
    �18,600 threshold in order for the Appellant to satisfy  the  financial
    eligibility requirements of Appendix FM.

6.   It was  thus  decided  by  the  Respondent  that  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM were not met by the  Appellant  and  that  there  were  not
    sufficient reasons outside of the  Rules  for  entry  clearance  to  be
    granted.  I should also add that the Respondent also asserted  that  in
    relation to an English test that the Appellant had sat, the  Respondent
    could not  find  evidence  of  that  on  line  at  the  time  that  the
    application was being considered.

7.   On appeal to the judge the Sponsor  appeared  and  gave  evidence.   As
    mentioned  above,  the  Appellant  and  Sponsor  were   successful   in
    persuading the judge that this was not a case where  paragraph  320(11)
    should have been invoked.   However  the  judge  went  on  to  consider
    whether the requirements of the Immigration Rules were satisfied at the
    date of the decision.

8.   Ms Record, who appeared before the judge on  behalf  of  the  Appellant
    (and who also appears before me) accepted before  the  judge  that  the
    financial eligibility requirements were not met at the date of decision
    and that the Rule was not satisfied.  The appeal was pursued on Article
    8 grounds.

9.   The findings made by the judge commencing at  paragraph  22  were  that
    there was a family life as between the Sponsor and the Appellant.  That
    in my view does not appear to have been disputed by the judge.  It  was
    noted as follows:

         "25. The Appellant relies upon family life with her husband. I note
             that from time to time family life has taken place between the
             Appellant and Sponsor in Nigeria when the Sponsor has visited.
              It would seem that the Appellant and sponsor have adapted  in
             some way to family life that for the majority of the  time  is
             conducted from a distance. I accept  that  in  this  case  the
             Appellant and Sponsor wish to be physically close  within  the
             UK although on the face of it there  is  no  real  reason  why
             married life cannot continue in Nigeria.  I  accept  that  the
             continued exclusion of the Appellant from the UK  will  be  an
             interference with her family life.  I find that  such  removal
             will be in  accordance  the  UK  government's  stated  aim  of
             maintaining immigration control into  the  UK.  The  issue  is
             whether it is a proportionate exercise of  any  discretion  to
             continue to exclude her from the UK.


         26.      I have some sympathy with the Appellant and  the  Sponsor.
             It is highly unlikely that  between  them  the  Appellant  and
             sponsor will be able to find sufficient funds  and  income  to
             satisfy the financial criteria under the Rules.  I  note  that
             in the case of MG (Serbia and Montenegro) [2005]  UKAIT  00113
             it was stated that sympathy for an individual did not  enhance
             a person's rights under Article 8."


10.  The judge also directed himself in law by reference to SS  (Congo)  and
    Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387 reminding himself that a near miss was not a
    relevant consideration tipping the balance in favour of  a  refusal  of
    entry clearance being disproportionate. The judge also directed himself
    in  law  as  to  the  requirements  of  Part  5A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and set out the provisions  of  Section
    117B at his paragraph 28.  He concludes his deliberations as follows:

         "29.     In general terms effective immigration control is  in  the
             public interest and that is why there are Rules to  which  all
             potential immigrants have to comply. In the  Appellant's  case
             the financial criteria were not met as  at  the  date  of  the
             decision.  They could not be met at the date of hearing.   The
             financial requirements cannot be treated lightly.   I  observe
             also that the sponsor is advancing in years.  His  health  may
             fail at any time leading to as loss in income and  a  need  to
             claim  state  benefits.   There  is  no  guarantee  that   the
             Appellant could find meaningful work.


         30.   I  make  the  observation  also  that  in  terms  of   family
             relationships the Appellant has children in  Nigeria  and  the
             sponsor has children in  the  UK.  I  observe  that  there  is
             apparently no bar  to  the  sponsor  living  in  Nigeria,  the
             country where he was born and brought up.  He  has  lived  for
             long periods in Nigeria with his wife.  He  accepts  that  his
             right to remain in the  UK  was  initially  derived  from  his
             children from a former marriage.  There is however  a  bar  to
             the Appellant living in the UK and that bar is created by  the
             Rules which form  part  of  the  UK  government's  immigration
             policy.   The  relationship  between  the  Appellant  and  the
             sponsor was formed when the Appellant had no right  to  remain
             in the UK. She had overstayed after coming on a visit.  Whilst
             that conduct in itself is insufficient in my view in her  case
             to invoke the provisions of paragraph 320(11) of the Rules the
             fact that the relationship between the Appellant  and  sponsor
             developed when the Appellant had no valid leave  is  something
             that I must  also consider as weighing in the balance  against
             her.


         31.  Taking all matters into consideration I find that in this case
             there  is  nothing  that  is  exceptional,  extraordinary,  or
             compelling that would merit considerations of the  Appellant's
             case outside of the Rules.  In this case the Rules  adequately
             deal with the circumstances put forward by the  Appellant  and
             sponsor.  The appeal also fails on human rights grounds."

11.  The Appellant sought permission to  appeal  against  that  decision  in
    grounds of appeal  dated  8  July  2015  prepared  by  Ms.  Record.  At
    paragraph 6 of the grounds the Appellant avers as follows:


         "6.  The Appellant applies for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
             Tribunal on the following grounds:


             (1)  The IJ did not  take  into  account  factors  as  regards
                  financial circumstances - under Article 8  which  supports
                  the Appellant's case and are relevant to proportionality.


             (2)  The IJ failed to take into account the genuine nature  of
                  the  marriage  and  the  distress  of  removal  that   the
                  relationship continuing - in other words (given the age of
                  the sponsor) the  case  of  Beoku-Betts  applies  and  the
                  removal of the Appellant significantly affected  both  the
                  Appellant and the sponsor.


             (3)  The IJ failed  to  take  into  account  the  prima  facie
                  mistake that removing the Appellant in the first place  is
                  a significant factor as regards public interest."

12.  I do not overlook the remainder of Ms. Record's  grounds  as  developed
    at paragraphs 7 to 12, but it suffices to observe that those additional
    paragraphs seek to amplify the core grounds set out in her paragraph 6.



13.  Permission to appeal was granted on 30 December 2015 by  Judge  P  J  M
    Hollingworth, essentially indicating that those grounds of appeal  were
    arguable.

14.  I have heard oral argument from Ms. Record today.  She sought  to  rely
    upon her grounds of appeal, and responded to queries that I  raised  in
    the course of my considering the case.  I did not require  Mr  Nath  to
    address me.

15.  Firstly, I sought clarification from Ms. Record about  what  was  meant
    by an assertion at paragraph 9 of her grounds of appeal.  It seemed  to
    me that it was being asserted that although the sponsor  did  not  have
    sufficient income to meet the financial  eligibility  criteria  at  the
    date of decision, that he did meet the financial  eligibility  criteria
    at the date of hearing.

16.  Ms. Record now clarifies that  that  is  not  the  assertion  that  she
    makes.  Even if it were the  case that  the  sponsor  at  the  date  of
    hearing had sufficient income such that the Appellant  met  the  income
    threshold, the judge would not have been  entitled to take that  change
    of circumstances into account on the  basis  of  the  authority  of  AS
    (Somalia) v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKHL 32 which provides  that
    in  an  entry  clearance   appeal   the   assessment   of   Article   8
    proportionality is to take place in relation to  the  circumstances  as
    they appertained at the date  of  decision  and  not  at  the  date  of
    hearing.

17.  That matter then having been made  clear,  I  did  not,  with  respect,
    fully follow the remainder of her ground of appeal as regards financial
    circumstances.  In response to the assertion that the judge  failed  to
    take into account factors as regards financial circumstances, I  reject
    that proposition.  The judge referred at his paragraphs 8 to 12 to  the
    issues raised by the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  the  decision  of  2
    October 2014, in which it is clear that the financial circumstances  of
    Appellant and sponsor are of concern and they do not meet the financial
    threshold of the relevant Rule.

18.  At paragraph 29 of the decision the judge returns to that issue in  his
    findings as I have quoted above.  It is recorded that the Appellant did
    not meet the financial eligibility criteria for leave to  remain  under
    the Rules, and gave weight to that fact, as he was entitled to do.

19.  Ms. Record draws my attention to Section 117B(3)  of  Part  5A  of  the
    2002 Act.  That provides:

         "It is in the public interest and in particular in the interests of
         the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom that persons who  seek
         to  enter  or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom   are   financially
         independent because such persons (a) are not a burden on taxpayers,
         and (b) are better able to integrate into society."

    By operation of Section 117A that is a relevant consideration which the
    judge was obliged to take into account.

20.  I find that he did exactly that.  He took into account  the  fact  that
    the  Appellant  would  not  meet  the  financial  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  Ms. Record seeks to  argue  that  even  though  the
    financial requirements under the Rules are not met, this  couple  would
    have  sufficient  income  in  the  United  Kingdom  to  be  financially
    independent, and the judge erred in failing to make a finding  in  that
    regard.

21.  I do not think that that is a finding which the judge  was  obliged  to
    make, having already ruled that the financial eligibility  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules were not satisfied, indeed, were not satisfied
    by a significant margin. I make no observation as to whether in another
    case, receipt of an income falling a little way short of �18,600  would
    or should result  in  a  person  being  treated  as  being  financially
    independent,   notwithstanding   that   the    financial    eligibility
    requirements are not met; that is not the situation which arose in  the
    present case.

22.  However even if the  Appellant  were  financially  independent  as  Ms.
    Record argues, this does not provide her with an entitlement  to  leave
    to remain.  I refer to AM (S.117B) [2015] UKUT 260 (IAC) 17 April  2015
    in which the Vice President  held  that  an  Appellant  can  obtain  no
    positive right to a grant of  leave  to  remain  under  either  section
    117B(2) or (3), whatever the degree of his fluency in  English  or  the
    strength of his financial resources.

23.   I  find  that  the  judge  was  aware  of  the  Appellant's  financial
    situation; he made findings  of  fact  in  relation  to  it  which  are
    sustainable and took the Appellant's non- satisfaction of the financial
    eligibility criteria of  Appendix  FM  into  account  in  his  ultimate
    proportionality balancing exercise.   I cannot  for  my  part  see  any
    material error of law in the  judge's  assessment  of  the  Appellant's
    financial circumstances.

24.  The second of the Appellant's grounds is that the judge failed to  take
    into account the genuine nature of the marriage and the distress of the
    removal. (Given that the present appeal is against a refusal  of  entry
    clearance, I take it that the references  to  removal  in  this  ground
    refer to the Appellant's earlier removal from the UK on 27 June 2011).

25.  In my assessment the judge made  findings  that  there  was  a  genuine
    relationship  eg  at  [25],  where  the  judge   described   how   that
    relationship  had  been  conducted  in  the  past,  and  accepted  that
    continued refusal of entry clearance would amount  to  an  interference
    with the family life as between the Appellant and sponsor. I cannot see
    that the judge erred in failing to make findings as to  the  nature  of
    the relationship including its genuineness.

26.  Ms Record also avers at  paragraph 10 of the  grounds  that  the  judge
    erred in failing to make reference to the fact that  the  Secretary  of
    State had, prior to the Appellant's departure, issued a certificate  of
    approval for marriage ('COA'). However, it is clear that the judge  was
    aware that such a certificate had been issued, on 15 March 2011,  prior
    to the Appellant's arrest as  an  overstayer  on  14  May  2011,  which
    prevented the marriage from taking place. These matters are set out  in
    the judge's decision at [3].

27.  In any event, the criteria for issuing COA in the  now  defunct  scheme
    related only to the immigration status of the parties to the  marriage,
    and upon the payment of a fee. The genuineness of the proposed marriage
    was simply not an issue to which the Secretary of State had regard when
    granting or refusing such a certificate. Indeed, following the House of
    Lords' judgment in R (on the application of Baiai) v SSHD [2009] 1 A.C.
    287, the Secretary of State was obliged in most cases to issue  such  a
    certificate and the issuing of a COA to the Appellant by the  Secretary
    of State was therefore not a matter which shed light  one  way  or  the
    other as to the alleged genuineness of the Appellant's marriage.  There
    is in my view no failure by the judge to take into account the  genuine
    nature of the marriage.

28.  The third ground is that the judge failed to  take  into  account  'the
    prima facie mistake in removing the Appellant in the first place'. I am
    not able to discern any properly articulated error of law  within  this
    ground.  The position adopted by the Secretary of  State  in  May  2011
    after interviewing the Appellant and Sponsor at  the  registry  office,
    was to form the view that the Appellant's knowledge of the sponsor  was
    not commensurate with that expected of  a  genuine  couple  seeking  to
    marry - see Respondent's decision of  2  October  2014,  and  also  the
    judge's decision at [3]. The Secretary of State's  decision  to  remove
    the Appellant in 2011 no doubt relied in part on that assessment.

29.  However, even though the present judge was prepared,  some  four  years
    later, based on evidence that was presented to him, to accept that  the
    Appellant was in a genuine relationship with the Sponsor, that does not
    establish that any 'mistake' was  made by the  Secretary  of  State  in
    2011 (against which there was at that time no judicial challenge of any
    sort), still yet any 'mistake' which the present judge was in some  way
    obliged to acknowledge as a  factor  relevant  to  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise, if indeed that is the Appellant's  argument.  There
    is no error of law disclosed in ground three.

Notice of Decision

30.  I find that the making of the decision by the First tier Judge did  not
    involve the making of any material error of law.

     I do not set aside the First tier decision; I uphold it.

     I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
