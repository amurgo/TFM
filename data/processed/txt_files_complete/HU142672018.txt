Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Reza, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Thailand.  She was born on 5 April  1970.
    The appellant appealed against the respondent's refusal  to  grant  her
    application for leave to remain in the UK dated 19  June  2018.   In  a
    decision promulgated  on  3  October  2018,  Judge  Kaler  (the  judge)
    dismissed the appeal  under  the  Rules  and  Article  8,  finding  the
    respondent's decision was proportionate.

 2. The grounds claim that the judge erred by failing  to  properly  assess
    the appellant's case in light of the evidence at the hearing.

 3. The judge referred to paragraph 276ADE of the Rules and said  that  the
    criteria (1)(i)-(v) were not met.   The  judge  then  tried  to  assess
    whether (vi) applied  although  she  did  not  refer  to  it  and  then
    attempted to link it to EX1 of the Rules.  The grounds claim  that  the
    appellant did not rely upon paragraph 276ADE.  Her case  was  based  on
    Appendix FM and also in particular, paragraph EX1 of Appendix  FM.   In
    her assessment, the judge did not make reference to paragraph EX1.

 4. The grounds claim that the judge's assessment at [23] of  her  decision
    was  flawed.   The  judge  said  she  had  no  information  about   the
    appellant's English language  skills.   The  grounds  claim  that  just
    because the appellant chose to give evidence through the assistance  of
    an interpreter  did  not  "...  ...  automatically  give  rise  to  the
    inference that her language skills are so poor as to engage s.117B(2)".
     The judge failed to take into consideration that  in  the  appellant's
    bundle her degree certificate from Thailand and a letter from UK  NARIC
    were included.  The NARIC letter confirmed that the appellant's  degree
    was  equivalent  to  a  British  degree  therefore  implying  that  she
    satisfied the English language requirements.

 5. At [22] the grounds claim the judge  accepted  the  appellant  and  her
    partner had established a family life but that the judge erred  in  her
    consideration of insurmountable obstacles  in  family  life  continuing
    outside the UK.  The grounds claim "... ... it can never be  reasonable
    to expect a British citizen to leave the UK" and  "...  ...  the  judge
    failed to give due weight  to  the  fact  that  the  couple  have  been
    together  for  eight  years."   The  grounds  claim   the   length   of
    relationship should  have  been  considered  as  a  weighty  factor  as
    compared to a relationship still in its primary stage.  Further, it was
    unreasonable to expect the appellant's sponsor to sell his house, leave
    his career and go to Thailand.

 6. The grounds claim the judge's consideration  of  the  appellant's  case
    outside the Rules was flawed.  The judge should  have  only  considered
    the issue of insurmountable obstacles  or  "hardship"  as  one  of  the
    factors and not the determinative factor.

 7. As regards [29] the grounds  claim  the  judge's  decision  was  flawed
    because the appellant only recently became an overstayer.  She came  as
    a student and then switched to the family member of  an  EEA  national.
    She made her current application within fourteen days of  being  appeal
    rights exhausted.   The  appellant  entered  a  relationship  with  her
    partner in 2010 at a time when she had a visa.  S.117B(4)  refers  only
    to establishing a private life or a relationship when the person was in
    the United Kingdom unlawfully.  The appellant  established  her  family
    life when she had leave so the judge should have given it more  weight.



 8. The appellant did not depend on public funds.  She had established  her
    own successful business.

 9. Leaving aside the issue of "maintenance of immigration control" none of
    the negative factors in s.117B applied to the appellant.

10. The judge  was  provided  with  evidence  of  the  appellant's  English
    language skills  in  terms  of  a  degree  certificate,  together  with
    confirmation from NARIC.  The sponsor's income was more  than  �18,600.
    The judge had documents relating to the sponsor's house  and  proof  of
    cohabitation.  It was argued that

         "... ... if the appellant had leave on the date of the hearing, she
         could have been successful in her leave to remain application as  a
         spouse under Appendix FM.  This evidence was  not  challenged.   It
         was argued before the Tribunal that this is a  case  where  Mostafa
         (Article  8  in  entry  clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  00112  (IAC)   is
         applicable".

11. Further, the appellant relied on Hesham Ali [2016] UKSC 60.  The  judge
    erred by failing to take the ability of the appellant  to  satisfy  the
    requirements  of  entry  clearance  as  a  spouse  into  the  balancing
    exercise.

12. Judge Baker granted permission on 5 November 2018 as follows:

         "1.  The appellant's application is for permission  to  appeal  the
             decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Kaler, who dismissed her
             appeal against refusal to grant indefinite leave to remain  on
             the basis of ten years' lawful residence.  The  appellant  who
             was represented had submitted further grounds of  appeal,  not
             considered in the  refusal  decision,  on  the  basis  of  her
             longstanding  relationship  with  her  British  partner.   The
             respondent did not object to this  also  being  considered  on
             appeal at the hearing.

         2.   The grounds in summary assert the relationship was incorrectly
             found to have been started when the appellant had no leave  to
             remain.  There is merit in that.  The appellant  was  entitled
             to remain and was not in breach of  immigration  control,  not
             divorced from her Italian spouse when  the  relationship  with
             her British sponsor started.  The judge as the grounds  assert
             thus arguably erred in concluding the  immigration  status  of
             the appellant was precarious, when the relationship  with  her
             British  national  partner  commenced,  prior  to  her  decree
             absolute from  her  Italian  spouse.   The  skeleton  argument
             acknowledges that she could  apply  from  Thailand  for  entry
             clearance, paragraph 26(j) and  (k)  that  that  should  be  a
             weighty factor  in  the  Article  8  assessment,  taking  into
             account Chikwamba and  Mostafa.   Further,  that  because  the
             appellant has never relied on public funds and had established
             a successful business in the UK, the only issue is maintenance
             of immigration control in assessing Article 8.   Paragraph  10
             of the grounds  assert  that  evidence  was  supplied  of  her
             English language ability, of her sponsor's income of more than
             �18,600 per annum, of accommodation, that it was  argued  that
             had the appellant had leave she  would  have  succeeded  in  a
             leave to  remain  application  (as  a  spouse)  and  that  the
             evidence lodged was not challenged.  The judge  did  not  make
             findings on all relevant factors, although it  appears  to  be
             correct that the evidence lodged showed income, over  a  year,
             of the  sponsor  of  over  �50,000  per  annum  and  of  their
             accommodation, of her business and of  his  work  in  the  UK.
             There is merit  in  the  grounds  that  the  assessment  under
             Article 8 is arguably materially in error,  having  regard  to
             the above".

13. The Secretary of State responded under Rule  24.   He  submitted  inter
    alia that the judge addressed herself  properly  to  the  evidence  and
    reached adequately reasoned findings:

14. It was clear from [15] of the decision that the judge  was  considering
    EX1 of Appendix FM.  The test in paragraph 276ADE(1) of the  Rules  was
    "very significant obstacles" while the test in EX1 was  "insurmountable
    obstacles".

15. It was open to the judge on the evidence before her to accept  at  [23]
    of her decision that the appellant spoke "some  English"  but  to  have
    "concerns" about whether she met s117B(2).

16. As regards [22], the respondent submitted that amounted to no more than
    a disagreement with the judge's findings on "insurmountable  obstacles"
    which were open to her on the evidence.

17. It was clear that the judge properly applied the five step Razgar  test
    and s.117B in her consideration of the appeal under Article  8  outside
    the Rules.  The absence  of  "insurmountable  obstacles"  was  not  the
    determinative factor.

18. As regards [29] the Supreme Court confirmed at  [49]  of  Agyarko  that



         "...  ...   an   important   consideration   when   assessing   the
         proportionality under Article  8  of  the  removal  of  non-settled
         migrants from  a  contracting  state  in  which  they  have  family
         members, is whether family life was created  at  a  time  when  the
         persons involved were aware that the immigration status of  one  of
         them was such that the persistence of that family life  within  the
         host state would from the outset be 'precarious'".

19. At [25], [26] and [29] of the decision the judge applied the principles
    emerging from Agyarko.  The appellant's status  here  has  always  been
    precarious in that the residence/leave granted  to  her  has  not  been
    indefinite".

20. The  judge  did  not  find  that  the  appellant  was  not  financially
    independent for the purposes of s.117(3).  Further, at [57] of Rhuppiah
    the Supreme Court found that where s.117B(2) and (3) were met,  it  was
    wrong to argue that there was a public interest in favour of the claim.
     The respondent also noted that the appellant had  not  challenged  the
    judge's negative finding at [21] that the appellant had applied for  an
    EEA permanent residence card at a time that her marriage was no  longer
    subsisting.  That negative finding  strengthened  the  public  interest
    side of the proportionality balancing exercise.

21. The appellant could not have met the requirements of Appendix FM on the
    date of the hearing because she had not made a  valid  application  for
    leave to remain as a partner.  See R-LTRP.1.1(b) of Appendix FM.

Submissions on Error of Law

22. Mr Reza relied upon the grounds.  The judge erred in  failing  to  take
    account of  the  evidence  from  UK  NARIC  which  confirmed  that  the
    appellant's degree was equivalent to a British degree and so  satisfied
    the  English  language   requirements.    As   regards   insurmountable
    obstacles, the judge  treated  this  as  the  determinative  factor  as
    opposed to only one of the factors.  Since  the  appellant  established
    family life with her current partner when  she  had  leave,  the  judge
    should have given more weight to the appellant's circumstances.

23. Mr Melvin relied upon the Rule 24 response.

Conclusion on Error of Law

24. Issues of weight to be given to the evidence were for  the  judge.   As
    regards the appellant's English language ability, Mr Reza would have me
    accept that because the letter from UK NARIC said the appellant's  Thai
    degree  was  equivalent  to  a  British  degree,  then  there  was   an
    implication that she satisfied the English language requirements.   The
    judge did  not  err  inviting  concerns  regarding  the  level  of  the
    appellant's English.  The evidence from UK NARIC  was  inconclusive  in
    terms of the  appellant's  English  language  ability.   There  was  no
    implication that because the appellant's Thai degree was equivalent  to
    a British degree  meant  that  the  appellant  satisfied  the  language
    requirements, particularly because the judge saw  no  English  language
    certificate.  The judge did  not  err  at  [26]  in  finding  that  the
    appellant had precarious  status.   See  Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC  11  and
    Rhuppiah at [43].  At [29] the judge found that  the  family  life  the
    appellant had established  with  her  partner  had  been  nurtured  and
    developed at a time  when  both  of  them  knew  that  her  status  was
    precarious.  The judge was entitled to come to that conclusion  bearing
    in mind Agyarko, Rhuppiah and TZ and PG [2018] EWCA Civ 1109.

25. The judge carried out an appropriate  analysis  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and then considered the appellant's circumstances  and  those  of
    the sponsor outside the Rules in terms of Article 8.  The judge carried
    out a comprehensive assessment at [10]-[34] of her decision.  She found
    there were no insurmountable obstacles to the appellant and the sponsor
    living  in  Thailand  and  that  the  respondent's  decision  with  the
    legitimate aim of maintaining a fair but  firm  system  of  immigration
    control was proportionate.  They  were  findings  that  the  judge  was
    entitled to come to on the evidence before her.

Decision

26. The judge's decision reveals no material error of law and shall  stand.



No anonymity direction is made.
