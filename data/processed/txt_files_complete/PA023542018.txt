For the appellant:     Mr S Mahmud of Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms S Vidyad Hanan, Senior Presenting Officer


                             DECSION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a  national  Vietnam  born  on  1  December  1999.  He
    appealed to the Upper  Tribunal  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Connor promulgated on 30 May 2018  refusing  his  appeal
    against the decision of the respondent dated 26 June 2015 refusing  his
    claim for asylum and humanitarian protection in the United Kingdom.

 2. Permission to appeal was given by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  ID  Boyes
    dated 31 July 2018. She was of the view that it was arguable  that  the
    Judge may have erred by failing to consider the case as a whole and  by
    failing to give weight to certain witnesses. The Judge also  failed  to
    apply the standard of proof correctly.

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me.

    First-tier Tribunal's findings

 4. The First-tier Tribunal  Judge  in  his  decision  made  the  following
    findings which I summarise. The appellant fears returning to Vietnam as
    he fears persecution from nonstate actors and  the  government  is  not
    able to protect him from them. The appellant believes he  would  be  at
    risk of  human  trafficking  as  a  young  person  and  he  would  have
    difficulty internally relocating. This risk is exacerbated because  his
    father was not able to satisfy  the  gangsters  and  also  because  the
    appellant does not have any family or support in Vietnam.

 5. The appellant made a claim for  asylum  after  he  entered  the  United
    Kingdom 7 October 2014 and his appeal was dismissed in  a  decision  by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Woodcraft dated 27 October 2016, but  granted
    him limited leave as an unaccompanied minor until he reached the age of
    17 ï¿½ years.

 6. In accordance with the principles of Devaseleen, the decision of  Judge
    Woodcraft is the starting point. The appellant's appeal is based on his
    rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  but
    and the findings made by Judge Woodcraft are relevant to his assessment
    under Article 8. The decision  of  Judge  Woodcraft  is  of  particular
    relevance in relation to the appellant's credibility  and  whether  his
    family/father is in Vietnam, and the assessment of risk  the  appellant
    faces if he is returned to Vietnam.

 7. The appellant's lack of credibility is evidenced by the  fact  that  he
    lied to the  French  authorities  about  his  true  identity  and  this
    concerned Judge Woodcraft that the appellant  would  also  lie  to  the
    United Kingdom authorities as to his identity. Judge Woodcraft did  not
    find the appellant's account as to what happened to him after  he  left
    Vietnam credible. The Judge did not accept that the appellant's  father
    who was arrested together with the appellant and fingerprinted had lost
    contact with his father. The Judge found that the appellant returned to
    Vietnam with his father. Judge Woodcraft also do not  accept  that  the
    appellant had been trafficked therefore  did  not  find  the  appellant
    would be on his return to Vietnam. The Judge considered the  report  of
    Prof Bluth which was based  on  the  concept  of  the  appellant  being
    particularly vulnerable because he had been trafficked  to  the  United
    Kingdom. Judge Woodcraft found that the appellant  was  returned  as  a
    resourceful young man had made a life for himself in the United Kingdom
    and did not fit the profile of a person vulnerable to trafficking.  His
    father who was evidently not short of money spent a  lot  of  money  to
    send the appellant to send him to Europe.

 8. The appellant was not uneducated as he was able  to  attend  school  in
    Hanoi and did not come from a rural area. The appellant does  not  have
    vulnerabilities and his only vulnerability is  his  age  which  can  be
    mitigated because his father remains  in  Vietnam  and  there  are  NGO
    support mechanisms for children in Vietnam.

 9. In respect of Article 8, the Judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  has
    established a private life in the United  Kingdom  as  he  has  made  a
    number of friends supported his application including his teacher  Miss
    Patel has found him to be an engaging young man who she fully supports.
    However, these friendships have been  developed  when  his  immigration
    status was precarious. Regard  must  be  had  to  section  17B  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as  the  appellant  should
    have had no expectation that his leave to remain  would  be  increased.
    Whatever relationships the appellant has  built  in  this  country  can
    maintained through modern means of communication.

10. Judge Woodcraft found that the appellant has not been honest about  his
    identity or the whereabouts of his father. His witness  Mr  Birkhamshaw
    stated that the appellant has  not  been  in  contact  with  anyone  in
    Vietnam, but it is not clear how he would know this.

11. The social services do not consider  the  appellant  resourceful  young
    man. However, that decision is based on the criteria of social services
    which is not set out in the correspondence seen. It  remains  the  case
    that the appellant was able to travel to  the  United  Kingdom  through
    Europe where he was caring for himself. He has  since  learned  further
    skills whilst in the United Kingdom.

12. Mr Campbell explained that he has been teaching  the  appellant  to  be
    independent and therefore there is no reason why he would not  be  able
    to return to Vietnam where  he  can  be  supported  by  his  father  or
    alternatively if there is no family support, NGO support mechanisms  re
    available to children in Vietnam.

13. It is accepted that the appellant is a man who has settled well in  the
    United Kingdom and established close friendships and a  bond  with  his
    foster brother, Nam. However, when carrying out  a  balancing  exercise
    with regard to section 117B it cannot be  found  that  the  appellant's
    private and family life in the United Kingdom holds  such  weight  that
    the decision of the respondent is disproportionate  to  its  legitimate
    aim. The Judge then stated that "the appeal is dismissed" but  did  not
    outline sections of the law.

    Grounds of appeal

14. The appellant appealed against the decision and the grounds  of  appeal
    state the following which I summarise. The first the Judge did not give
    sufficient weight, or any weight to the conclusion by  the  appellant's
    Independent reviewing  Officer,  Mr  Brinkhamshaw,  who  had  extensive
    knowledge of the appellant set  out  in  a  detailed  letter  dated  26
    February 2018. Had the Judge given proper consideration to this letter,
    the decision would have been different.

15. The Judge failed to take into account that the appellant in the opinion
    of the Independent  Reviewing  Officer  was  that  he  was  lacking  in
    emotional maturity and was not ready for semi-independent accommodation
    and required further care. The Judge when stating that he has not  seen
    the criteria used by the Independent Reviewing Office did not apply the
    balance of probabilities test correctly because that was the conclusion
    reached by the team responsible for the appellant's care. The  decision
    reached was that the appellant is one of the few who was not ready  for
    independent living despite attaining the age  of  18  to  his  lack  of
    maturity. That should have been sufficient for the  Court  to  conclude
    the appellant was more vulnerable than a young man of his  age  in  the
    same situation and should have not  required  more  when  applying  the
    balance of probabilities.

16. The Judge did not apply the correct burden of proof when he  posed  the
    question to whether the appellant has family in Vietnam said that  this
    cannot be answered conclusively. He then posed the possibility that  if
    returned without family support the appellant can avail the  assistance
    of NGOs who help children in Vietnam. The Judge  while  accepting  that
    his decision would be devastating  for  the  appellant  and  his  blood
    brother, did not take into account that separating the  appellant  from
    the  much-needed  care   from   his   foster   parent   will   have   a
    disproportionate effect on their lives.

17. There was evidence that to date the Red Cross have  not  been  able  to
    track down the appellant's family in Vietnam. The Judge failed to  take
    into account all the evidence in  the  round  that  the  appellant  has
    provided sufficient evidence that  he  is  vulnerable  and  lacking  in
    maturity and has thereby departed from the modest test of a balance  of
    probabilities required something over and above that.

18. While the decision of Judge Woodcraft is the starting point, there  was
    little consideration for why the appellant must continue to live in the
    care of his foster carer beyond the expected age of 18.  The  appellant
    is younger than his chronological age and returning him  to  a  country
    where he may have spent a few years with no knowledge of his family  or
    any link with his past would be to disrupt the established family  life
    that the appellant now enjoys with others who are not blood  relatives.
    The appellant's foster carer has helped him get a solid  structure  and
    foundation and returning him will set him back and undo what  has  been
    done to assist him.

    The hearing

19. At the hearing I heard submissions from both parties which I  will  not
    set out.

    Decision as to whether there is an error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

20. I have given  anxious  scrutiny  to  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and have taken into account the  grounds  of  appeal  and  the
    evidence provided at the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
    gist of all the grounds of appeal is that the Judge  did  not  consider
    the evidence in the round and did  not  apply  the  correct  burden  of
    proof, on a balance of probabilities, in evaluating the evidence.

21. There is merit in this argument. The appellant came to this country  as
    a minor and his asylum and humanitarian protection claim was  dismissed
    by the respondent and his appeal against  the  decision  was  heard  by
    Judge Woodcraft who found the appellant not credible and dismissed  his
    appeal. The Judge was entitled to take into  account  the  decision  of
    Judge Woodcraft as the starting point and  accept  that  that  was  the
    appellant's situation as of the date of hearing. The Judge was  however
    expected to take into account evidence the appellant's situation  after
    that date.

22. The Judge in this assessment of Article 8 did not give a wide berth  to
    the evidence of  the  appellant  within  the  parameters  of  assessing
    evidence of a vulnerable witness.  Although  the  Judge  conducted  the
    hearing on the basis that the appellant was a  vulnerable  witness  but
    that did not feature in his decision.  He  accepted  the  past  adverse
    credibility findings made by Judge Woodcraft respect of his asylum  and
    humanitarian protection claim and translated it into  his  analysis  of
    Article 8 and proportionality.

23. The Judge did not consider the evidence of the appellant's  Independent
    reviewing Officer, Mr Brimkshaw  who  in  a  detailed  letter  set  out
    appellant's vulnerability and  lack  of  maturity.  The  Judge  in  his
    decision stated that he was not familiar  with  the  criteria  used  by
    independent reviewing officers. In the letter  it  was  clear  that  Mr
    Brinkmanshaw set  out  why  the  appellant  was  not  ready  for  semi-
    independent accommodation because he was younger than his chronological
    age and continued to require further support and accommodation  by  his
    foster parent. By  requiring  the  criteria  used  by  the  independent
    reviewing officers, the Judge placed too high a burden of proof on  the
    appellant.

24. This was an important piece of evidence  and  evidence  which  was  not
    before Judge Woodcraft. Failure to consider this evidence is a material
    error.

25. The Judge relied on the conclusion of Judge Woodcraft that he  was  not
    telling the truth about his father's whereabouts because  he  had  lied
    about his identity in France and therefore must be lying to the British
    authorities about his identity which is the reason why his father could
    not be traced. The Judge said even if the appellant's father cannot  be
    traced, he can rely on the support of NGOs  which  provide  support  to
    children in Vietnam. The Judge did  not  take  into  account  that  the
    appellant was a child of about 13 years of age when he  was  in  France
    and failed to consider the possibility that he did what he was told  to
    do.

26. There was clearly insufficient analysis of the evidence in the round as
    to whether the appellant could be returned to Vietnam if his father had
    not been traced. It was incumbent of the Judge to make a  fake  finding
    as to whether the appellant would be returned to his  father  or  avail
    himself of the services of an NGO in Vietnam. The Judge  left  it  open
    ended and said that the appellant can be returned to Vietnam in  either
    case without analysis of the difficulties in each  scenario  given  the
    appellant's vulnerability and lack of maturity.

27. I find that the Judge was not entitled  to  reach  his  conclusion  the
    appellant can be returned to Vietnam at the present time. The Judge did
    not  consider  all  the  evidence  including  the  evidence  from   the
    Independent Immigration Officer respect of his analysis under Article 8
    and relied on the findings of Judge  Woodcraft  about  the  appellant's
    adverse credibility. The Judge failed to  take  into  account  all  the
    evidence that post-dated the decision of Judge Woodcraft

28. I find considering all the evidence, the appellant cannot  be  returned
    to Vietnam at  the  present  time.  The  letter  from  the  Independent
    reviewing Officer, Mr Brimkshaw makes it clear that the appellant's age
    is below his chronological age and he lacks the maturity to live on his
    own and still needs assisted accommodation until  he  is  at  least  21
    years old when a further valuation would be needed.

29. I therefore set aside the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under Article 8  of
    the European Convention on Human Rights. This concludes the appeal.
