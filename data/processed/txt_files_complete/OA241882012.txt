                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Seelhoff made following a hearing at Hatton  Cross  on  25th  September
    2013.

Background

 2. The claimant is a national of Pakistan born on 12th November 1985.   He
    is married to a British national.  He applied for entry  clearance  but
    was refused on the grounds that he had not provided  evidence  to  show
    that his Sponsor earned �18,600 and  had  not  provided  the  specified
    documents required  under  the  Rules  to  establish  that  the  income
    threshold had been met.  Nor had he provided evidence that he  had  sat
    the mandatory English test.

 3. It was conceded at the hearing that the claimant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules.  The Sponsor  gave  evidence  and  confirmed
    that as at the date of application she was earning about �12,000 a year
    and had savings of �3,340 in her own account. There was  also  a  joint
    account with herself and her husband  which  held  approximately  �400.
    There was also evidence that the family would  hand  over  a  dowry  of
    �30,000 from six relatives in the UK when the  claimant  arrived  here.
    It was her evidence that she could not move to Pakistan because all her
    family are here.

 4. The judge referred herself to the relevant case law, in  particular  MM
    and R (on the application of) v SSHD [2013] EWHC 720  (Admin)  and  the
    conclusion of Blake J that the combination of the new Rules:

         "... amount together to a disproportionate  interference  with  the
         rights of British citizen Sponsors and refugees  to  enjoy  respect
         for family life.  In terms of the Strasbourg approach they  do  not
         represent a fair balance between the competing interests  and  fall
         outside  the  margin  of  appreciation  or  discretionary  area  of
         judgment   available   in   policymaking   in   this   sphere    of
         administration."

 5. Blake J accepted that the wider margin of appreciation was likely to be
    relevant to foreign Sponsors who are voluntary migrants but not British
    citizens or refugees.

 6. He went on to identify five less  intrusive  measures  which  could  be
    applied to such cases as follows:

         "1.  Reducing the minimum income required of the Sponsor  alone  to
             �13,500; or thereabouts;

         2.   Permitting any savings over the �1,000 that may  be  spent  on
             processing the application itself to be used to supplement the
             income figure;

         3.   Permitting account to be taken of the earning capacity of  the
             spouse after entry or the satisfactorily supported maintenance
             undertakings of third parties;

         4.   Reducing to twelve  months  the  period  for  which  the  pre-
             estimate of financial viability is assessed."

 7. The judge  wrote as follows:

         "In assessing the fifth stage of the Razgar  test  I  consider  the
         facts of this case.  The Sponsor at the date of application  earned
         approximately �12,000 which is now corroborated by bank statements,
         payslips and employer letters.  She also  had  savings  of  roughly
         �3,800.  If as envisaged in point 2 quoted above  I  disregard  the
         first �1,000 and then assess the savings over a one year period (as
         envisaged in 4) I have  �12,000  income  plus  �2,800  towards  the
         income threshold, which is envisaged in point  1  as  �13,500.   In
         this case I have a theoretical income of �14,800 against a required
         income of �13,500 and I consider that it is open to me to find that
         this is sufficient funds.

         In  addition  to  this  there  is  potentially  a  significant  sum
         available as a dowry, albeit I would attach more weight to  it  had
         it been paid over already.   The  Sponsor  has  free  accommodation
         available from her family which would reduce her needs and those of
         the Appellant.  I also attach weight to the misinformation  on  the
         Home Office website.  It is significant that the Sponsor is a woman
         given that women on average  earn  less  in  the  UK  and  is  from
         Doncaster where earnings are lower than the  UK  average  but  also
         living costs are considerably lower than London.

         I have considered the attempt at deception in seeking to  have  the
         old Rules applied to the case,  but  I  note  that  the  point  was
         abandoned before me and while not excused  I  do  not  consider  it
         appropriate to bear in mind  the  unfairness  in  discovering  that
         Rules other than those which appeared on the  Home  Office  website
         were to be applied to the application.

         On the facts of this case I find  that  the  refusal  represents  a
         disproportionate interference  in  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
         Appellant and his British Sponsor and I therefore allow the  appeal
         on the basis of those rights."

The Grounds of Application

 8. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the grounds  that
    the Tribunal had used MM as a basis for creating a  theoretical  income
    for the Sponsor.  In MM if Blake J had applied the proper principles to
    his assessment of proportionality he would have been compelled  to  the
    conclusion that the  interference  in  the  Article  8  rights  of  the
    applicants and their families caused by the material provisions of  the
    new Rules was proportionate.  As Mr Justice Blake correctly  recognised
    the Rules pursue a legitimate aim and are rationally connected to  that
    aim: they strike a balance between  the  interests  of  applicants  and
    their families, and the wider interests of society as a  whole.   There
    was nothing arbitrary about the balance  struck  by  the  Secretary  of
    State: it was the product of careful  consideration,  consultation  and
    expert advice.  It was therefore submitted that in relying upon  MM  in
    its proportionality assessment the Tribunal was relying upon an  unsafe
    authority and its conclusions cannot stand.  The  Tribunal  should  not
    have applied the lower threshold limit established in that  case.   The
    Tribunal's conclusion does not reach a rational  outcome  since  it  is
    anticipating that the Appellant and Sponsor will, in the absence of any
    evidence shown to the contrary, be restricted to an  annual  income  of
    �12,000  which  is  significantly  below  the  level  of  the  national
    immigration wage.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Martin on 30th
    October 2013.

Submissions

10. Mr Diwnycz relied on his grounds and said that the claimant  could  not
    meet the requirements  of the Rules.

11. Mr Simghrajah submitted that MM was binding authority on the judge.  He
    relied on the case of Mukarkar v SSHD [2006]  EWCA  Civ  1045  for  the
    proposition that the mere fact that one Tribunal has reached a generous
    decision does not mean that there has been any error of law  so  as  to
    justify an appeal. The judge had conducted a balancing exercise as  she
    was required to do and had  properly  set  out  the  relevant  law  and
    reached a decision on the basis of the facts which were open to her.

Findings and Conclusion

12. Insofar as the grounds are a complaint about the decision  in  MM  they
    are not relevant to this appeal since MM was a  binding  authority  for
    the First-tier Tribunal and remains good law unless  and  until  it  is
    overturned.

13. On the evidence before  the  judge  the  Sponsor  earned  approximately
    �12,000, a little below the figure of �13,500 suggested by Blake J. The
    judge then added �2,800 (the claimant's savings less �1,000) to give  a
    theoretical income of �14,800 which was above the level set by Blake J.



14. When Blake J was considering the question of  the  use  of  savings  to
    augment income he wrote as follows:

         "130.    When decision  makers  and  judges  assess  pre-July  2012
             applications for adequacy of maintenance,  particularly  where
             the maintenance limits rise because of dependent children, any
             shortfall in proven earnings can be met by evidence of capital
             resources.  Thus supposing a person with  a  dependent  spouse
             and children needed to show an income of �15,000 to  meet  the
             income support subsistence level test  then  applicable  could
             only show part-time earnings of �12,500; such a  person  could
             make good the difference if at the  time  of  the  application
             there were cash assets of  �6,250  available  to  support  the
             couple for the full 30 month period before  the  next  review.
             It was not necessary that savings of �16,000 first had  to  be
             shown before regard  could  be  had  to  such  savings.   This
             approach will still apply to classes of people exempt from the
             new requirements.

         131. If a similar approach had been permitted on  the  new  �18,600
             target, particularly if limited to the first 12 months  before
             review, then if  a  claimant  such  as  MM  could  demonstrate
             savings of �3,000 when added to his �15,600  income  he  could
             meet the threshold to permit his wife to come to the UK. ... I
             recognise that the Secretary of State's case is  that  she  is
             looking for long-term economic viability of families after the
             spouse has acquired settlement five years after entry, but  if
             so  it  seems  to  me  that  examination  of   the   financial
             circumstances of the couple  at  the  end  of  the  five  year
             period, when the earning capacities of  both  parties  can  be
             taken into account, is the time to make the assessment  rather
             than to front-load the substantial financial burdens on a self-
             sufficient but low-paid earner before the spouse is admitted.

         132.     Although the requirement of 30 month  assessment  preceded
             the July 2012 Rules, the inflexible continued use  of  such  a
             period when the income and capital requirements have  been  so
             dramatically heightened, is not permissible when the potential
             consequences are so severe. ... A twelve month period as  once
             was the case gives the family members a reasonable  chance  to
             settle themselves and absorb the expenses connected  with  the
             application itself."

15. Accordingly since the Sponsor earned approximately  �12,000  and,  with
    her �2,800 savings which Blake J suggested ought to  be  permitted  her
    financial resources were raised to the level suggested by  Blake  J  in
    MM.

16. Moreover there were other factors to be taken into account.  The  judge
    made reference to a figure of �30,000 which had yet to be paid over but
    which she seems to have accepted was in the frame, although it was  not
    the basis of her decision.  She was also entitled to count  it  against
    the Secretary of State, in the proportionality exercise, that there was
    no indication on the UKBA website as at the  date  of  the  application
    that new and more stringent Rules would be applied to the case.

17. In  conclusion,  the  Secretary  of  State's  challenge  amounts  to  a
    challenge on the decision of MM which  was  binding  authority  on  the
    judge and accordingly discloses no error of law.

Decision

The decision stands.  The claimant's appeal is allowed.
