                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is a somewhat unusual case.  The  respondent,  Mr  Moiseev,  hails
    from Moldova, but had been living for several years in the Republic  of
    Ireland before taking up a place at  the  University  of  Greenwich  in
    2008.  His wife, Ina, and his  daughter,  Alexandra,  joined  him  from
    Moldova in 2009, and in 2010 he obtained leave to remain for two  years
    as a Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrant.  In May 2012 Mr Moiseev made  an
    in-time application for  leave  to  remain  outside  the  Points  Based
    System, with his wife and child as his dependants, and  nearly  a  year
    went  by  before  this  application  was  refused  on  1st  May   2013.
    Simultaneously, a decision was taken to remove Mr Moiseev under section
    47 of the 2006 Act.  By this time, on 27th November 2012, Ina had  been
    issued with a  certificate  showing  that  she  had  regained  Romanian
    citizenship, although it was not until 27th  June  2013  that  she  and
    Alexandra were issued with Romanian passports.  On 15th August 2013  Mr
    Moiseev's appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal for  determination
    'on the papers', and it is that determination which has been challenged
    by the Secretary of State.  I have to say that, in granting  permission
    to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, Judge Easterman  pointed  out  lucidly
    and succinctly just what the problem was, and after hearing submissions
    from both sides today, I find myself taking exactly the same view.

2.    Judge Iqbal dismissed the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  but
    made a further three decisions favourable to  Mr  Moiseev.   She  held,
    quite rightly, that the removal decision under section 47  was  not  in
    accordance with the law.  Unnecessarily in my view,  she  "remitted  it
    back" to the Secretary of  State.   At  today's  hearing,  Miss  Holmes
    helpfully withdrew the removal decision.  Judge  Iqbal  also  "remitted
    back ... all aspects of the Appellant's claim that  might  arise  under
    the EEA Regulations 2006", but she allowed the  appeal  outright  under
    Article 8.  It is the two latter decisions of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which were the focus of submissions today.

3.   Those submissions covered the ground very thoroughly,  and  I  mean  no
    disrespect to the advocates if I do not try to summarise them now.  The
    fact is, the First-tier Tribunal got completely confused between rights
    arising under the 'free movement' provisions of European Community  law
    and rights arising under the humanitarian provisions  of  the  European
    Convention.

4.   Essentially,  the  appeal  was  allowed  under  Article  8  because  Mr
    Moiseev's wife and daughter have acquired Romanian nationality and  are
    now Union citizens.  But the fact that Mr Moiseev may be eligible for a
    residence card if he applies for one, as the spouse of a Union  citizen
    who is exercising 'Treaty rights' in  the  United  Kingdom,  is  not  a
    reason for allowing the appeal under Article 8.   The  application  has
    yet to be made, and if it is made, it will probably succeed.  There  is
    documentary evidence in the bundle prepared by AA  Immigration  Lawyers
    to show that Ina Moiseev has been undertaking part-time employment  and
    has also registered a company called Denina.  On the other hand, if Ina
    and Alexandra were not Union citizens, it  is  hard  to  see  how  this
    family, after residing together in this country for  only  four  years,
    could possibly establish a right to remain on Article 8 grounds.

5.   The First-tier Tribunal has clearly  erred  in  law,  and  Miss  Holmes
    sensibly suggests that the Upper Tribunal should allow the Secretary of
    State's appeal and re-make the  decision  on  the  original  appeal  by
    simply dismissing it.  I agree.  With the withdrawal  of  the  decision
    under section 47, there is no longer any threat of removal hanging over
    Mr  Moiseev.   He  can  apply  for  a  residence  card  under  the  EEA
    Regulations 2006 for the not unreasonable sum of ï¿½55, and  Ina  Moiseev
    can apply  for  a  registration  certificate  if  she  so  wishes.   Mr
    Moiseev's Moldovan passport is at the Home  Office,  probably  with  an
    Enforcement group, and it would be convenient  if,  instead  of  having
    first to get his passport back, Mr Moiseev could apply straight away to
    the European Casework Directorate,  to  which  his  passport  could  be
    transferred directly from Enforcement.

6.   It would certainly be  more  advantageous  to  Mr  Moiseev  to  have  a
    residence card, valid for five years with  the  prospect  of  permanent
    residence thereafter, than to  be  granted  discretionary  leave  under
    Article 8.  In the unlikely event that his application is refused and a
    fresh decision is taken to remove him, he will of course  have  a  full
    right of appeal against that decision.




     DECISION

     The Secretary of State's appeal is allowed, and  the  decision  on  the
    appeal against the refusal of further leave to  remain  is  re-made  by
    dismissing it.
