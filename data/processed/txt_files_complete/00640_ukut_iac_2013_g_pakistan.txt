On the current state of the authorities:

a) the maintenance requirements of E-LTRP.3.1-3.2 stand,  although  Blake  J
   in R (on the application of MM)   v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
   Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin) said that they  could  constitute  an
   unjustified and disproportionate interference with the ability of spouses
   to live together; he suggested that an appropriate figure may  be  around
   �13,400, and highlighted the  position  of  young  people  and  low  wage
   earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;
b) after applying the requirements of  the  Rules,  only  if  there  may  be
   arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain  outside  them  is  it
   necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there  are
   compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  them:  R  (on
   the application of) Nagre v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
   [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin);
c) the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such  as  Section  EX.1
   are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF (Article 8  -  new
   rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT 00393 (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8  -  new  rules)
   [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC); they  concern  the  practical  possibilities  of
   relocation. In the  absence  of  such  insurmountable  obstacles,  it  is
   necessary  to   show   other   non-standard   and   particular   features
   demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

The Secretary of State  addressed  the  Article  8  family  aspects  of  the
respondent's position through the Rules, in particular EX1, and the  private
life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The judge should have done  likewise,
also  paying  attention  to  the  Guidance.  Thus  the  judge  should   have
considered the Secretary of State's conclusion under EX.1  that  there  were
no insurmountable obstacles preventing the continuation of the  family  life
outside the UK. Only if there were arguably good grounds for granting  leave
to remain outside the rules was it necessary for him for Article 8  purposes
to go on  to  consider  whether  there  were  compelling  circumstances  not
sufficiently recognised under the Rules.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


Introduction


 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of Judge
    SJ Pacey, promulgated on 12 August 2013, which allowed the respondent's
    appeal and held that it was disproportionate and unlawful under Article
    8 of the European Convention on Human Rights to remove her to Pakistan.



Background


 2. Mrs Gulshan, the respondent  to  this  appeal,  was  born  in  1953  in
    Karachi, Pakistan and married her husband  (Noor  Ali  Nazar  Ali,  the
    sponsor) in 1975.   They  have  two  daughters,  who  live  with  their
    husbands in Pakistan.  There  is  a  son,  nearly  30  years  old,  who
    apparently has been in this country for some 8 years.   It  seems  that
    the husband, now aged 67, came to the United Kingdom at some  point  in
    the early 1990s.  Since details of his immigration status were  unclear
    from the papers we asked Ms Peterson, representing the  respondent,  to
    take instructions.  The husband was present in court.   It  seems  that
    the husband had entered the country as a visitor  but  had  overstayed.
    In late 2002 he had been granted indefinite leave to remain and in 2006
    became a British citizen.   On instructions  Ms  Peterson  informed  us
    that he started to work in 2003.  He has now retired.


 3. The respondent does not work and has no income.  The husband is now  in
    receipt of  a  state  pension  and  with  pension  credit  that  totals
    �7,420.40 per annum.  He seems to have received tax credits since 2006.
     He rents a council property in Hackney, London.  He pays  �67.08  rent
    per month, but receives housing benefit and council tax  benefit.   The
    respondent has had an account with the Pak Fidai  General  Co-Operative
    Society Ltd for 3 years.  There  are  savings  of  �28,996.70  in  that
    account.


 4. The respondent has visited her husband in the United  Kingdom  a  large
    number of times - we were told on some  19  occasions  -  on  visitors'
    visas.  Her application  for  leave  to  remain  in  January  2006  was
    refused.  In 2007 she was granted multi visit entry clearance  until  7
    September 2012.  Since arriving on her last visit in  March  2012,  she
    has remained here with her husband.  On 5 September 2012  she  made  an
    application for leave to remain as a spouse of  a  person  present  and
    settled here.


 5. On 5 March  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  respondent's
    application.  The refusal letter gave a number of reasons.  First,  the
    respondent did not have the requisite immigration status.  Second,  she
    did not meet the minimum income requirements of paragraph  E-LTRP.  3.2
    of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules, since  she  had  not  provided
    wage slips covering the requisite period.  It was said,  thirdly,  that
    she had failed to provide an English language certificate.  It  is  now
    accepted that she has good English.  Referring to her family life under
    Article 8 ECHR the letter  invoked  the  requirements  of  Section  EX:
    Exception of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules  and  concluded  that
    the respondent had not demonstrated any insurmountable obstacles  which
    would prevent her from continuing her family life  outside  the  United
    Kingdom.  The letter finally considered whether  removal  would  breach
    her rights to private life under Article 8 of ECHR.   By  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules  the  letter  said  that  the
    respondent could not show that she had no social or cultural ties  with
    her home country.

The judge's decision


 6. The respondent appealed on  various  grounds.  She  was  married  to  a
    British citizen and the Secretary  of  State  had  not  considered  the
    evidence  submitted  in  support  of  her  application.   Nor  had  the
    Secretary of State addressed the long relationship with her husband  in
    the United Kingdom.  The Secretary of State  "has  not  considered  the
    [respondent's] rights under Article 8 of ECHR as a wife of her  husband
    who is settled in the United Kingdom".


 7. Before Judge Pacey counsel for the respondent conceded that  she  could
    not succeed under the Immigration Rules.  The judge accepted that  that
    concession was rightly made.  The respondent's counsel invoked the then
    recent decision of R (on the application of MM) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900  (Admin)  for  the  contention
    that the interference with the respondent's family life under Article 8
    was disproportionate.   The respondent's evidence before  the  Tribunal
    was that her husband was 67 years old and she herself was  now  in  her
    old age.  She could no longer continue as a frequent traveller  to  the
    United Kingdom because of her age.  She needed to be with  her  husband
    to provide care and emotional  support.   There  was  medical  evidence
    relating to the husband before the Tribunal.  The judge concluded  that
    it did not indicate that the husband had any material care  needs.   In
    cross-examination the respondent accepted  that  she  had  not  applied
    earlier to remain as a spouse  because  her  two  daughters  were  then
    unmarried in Pakistan.  She told the judge that since her  husband  has
    been here for over 20 years he could not live in Pakistan anymore.


 8. In her reasons the judge said that she readily accepted that  both  the
    respondent and her husband were no longer young.   Perfectly  naturally
    and reasonably they wished to be together.   The  judge  also  accepted
    that it  would  cause  considerable  cost  and  inconvenience  for  the
    respondent to travel to and from Pakistan to see him.  Referring to  MM
    the judge stated that the central  question  was  whether  the  minimum
    income provisions in the  Immigration  Rules  were  a  disproportionate
    interference with the right to respect for family life.  Among  reasons
    for refusal was the minimum income requirement.   The  findings  in  MM
    relating to the financial criteria had an inescapable relevance to  the
    circumstances of the appeal.  The presenting officer had submitted that
    the proper course of  action  would  be  for  the  respondent  to  have
    returned to Pakistan and  make  the  application  for  entry  clearance
    there, but "to require the appellant to return and make an  application
    ... would, in my judgment, be disproportionate and bearing in mind  her
    age and the inconvenience and cost involved".   On  the  basis  of  her
    consideration of these various factors the  judge  concluded  that  the
    decision under appeal was disproportionate and unlawful  under  Article
    8.  On that basis she dismissed the appeal under the Immigration  Rules
    but allowed it on human rights grounds.

The law

(a) The July 2012 Immigration Rules


 9. There were major changes in July 2012 in the Immigration Rules covering
    applications for entry clearance  and  leave  to  remain  as  a  family
    member.  Appendix FM is the route for those seeking to enter or  remain
    in the UK on the basis of their family life with  a  person  who  is  a
    British citizen, is settled in the UK, or is in  the  UK  with  limited
    leave as a refugee or person  granted  humanitarian  protection.    The
    purpose is made plain at the outset (GEN.1.1).

       "It sets  out  the  requirements  to  be  met  and,  in  considering
       applications under this route, it reflects how, under Article  8  of
       the Human Rights Convention, the balance will be struck between  the
       right to respect for private and family life and the legitimate aims
       of protecting national security, public safety and the economic well-
       being  of  the  UK;  the  prevention  of  disorder  and  crime;  the
       protection of health or morals; and the protection of the rights and
       freedoms of others. It also takes into account the need to safeguard
       and promote the welfare of children in the UK."


10. Section R-LTRP. 1.1  of  Appendix  FM  contains  the  requirements  for
    limited leave to remain as a partner, which are that the applicant  and
    their partner must be in the United Kingdom; the  applicant  must  have
    made a valid application for limited or indefinite leave to remain as a
    partner; the applicant  satisfies  the  suitability  requirements;  and
    either the applicant meets all of the requirements of  Section  E-LTRP,
    or the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs  E-LTRP.1.2-1.12.
    and E-LTRP.2.1 and paragraph EX.1 applies.


11. Section E-LTRP  of  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules  contains
    relationship  requirements  in   E-LTRP.1.2-1.12.    Then   there   are
    immigration status requirements: in broad terms one must not be in  the
    United Kingdom as a visitor, with valid leave less than 6 months, or on
    temporary    admission/release:    E-LTRP.2.1-2.2.     The    financial
    requirements (as relevant) are as follows:


       "Financial requirements


       E-LTRP.3.1 The applicant must provide specified evidence,  from  the
       sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of-


       (a) a specified gross annual income of at least-


            (i) �18,600;


            ...alone or in combination with


       (b) specified savings of-


            (i) �16,000; and


           (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to 2.5 times the
           amount which is the difference between the gross  annual  income
           from the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2.(a)-(f) and  the
           total amount required under paragraph E-LTRP.3.1.(a); or


       (c) the  requirements  in  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.3.being  met,  unless
       paragraph EX.1. applies.


       ...


       E-LTRP.3.2. When determining whether the  financial  requirement  in
       paragraph ELTRP.  3.1. is met only  the  following  sources  may  be
       taken into account-


       ...


       (c) specified pension income of the applicant and partner;


       ...


       (g) specified savings of the applicant..."
          The  English  language  requirements  are   in   E-LTRP.4.1.    If
    applicants do not satisfy the  financial  requirements  and/or  English
    language in E-LTRP.3.4, they may qualify  under  Section  EX:Exception.
    The relevant part of this reads:

       "EX.1. This paragraph applies if


       ...


       (b) the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship  with  a
       partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled in the UK
       or in the UK with refugee  leave  or  humanitarian  protection,  and
       there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that  partner
       continuing outside the UK."


12. Section FM 1.0 of the October 2013 Immigration Directorate Instructions
    ("Partner and  ECHR  Article  8  guidance")  is  about  family  members
    applying after  9  July  2012  under  Chapter  8  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules. It sets out the guidance for  caseworkers  in  their
    approach to decision-making under the new rules.  The  Guidance  states
    that it:


       "reflects a two-stage approach to considering applications under the
       family and private life rules in Appendix FM and  paragraph  276ADE-
       DH. First, caseworkers must consider whether the applicant meets the
       requirements of the rules, and if they do,  leave  under  the  rules
       should be granted. If the applicant does not meet  the  requirements
       of the rules, the  caseworker  must  move  on  to  a  second  stage:
       whether, based on an overall consideration of the facts of the case,
       there are  exceptional  circumstances  which  mean  refusal  of  the
       application would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the
       individual  or  their  family  such  that  refusal  would   not   be
       proportionate  under  Article  8.  If  there  are  such  exceptional
       circumstances, leave outside the rules should be  granted.  If  not,
       the application should be refused".


13. "Insurmountable obstacles" are dealt with in paragraph  3.2.7c  of  the
    Guidance. This states  that  the  decision-maker  should  consider  the
    seriousness of the difficulties which the applicant and  their  partner
    would face in continuing their family life outside the United  Kingdom,
    and whether they entail something that  could  not  (or  could  not  be
    expected to) be overcome, even with a degree of  hardship  for  one  or
    more of the individuals concerned. It is said to  be  a  different  and
    more stringent assessment than  whether  it  would  be  "reasonable  to
    expect" the applicant's partner to join them overseas. For  example,  a
    British Citizen partner who has lived in the  UK  all  their  life  and
    speaks only English may not wish to uproot and relocate halfway  across
    the world, "but a significant degree of hardship or inconvenience  does
    not amount to  an  insurmountable  obstacle".   The  decision-maker  is
    advised to look at whether there is an inability to live in the country
    concerned. The focus should also be on the family life which  would  be
    enjoyed in the country to which the applicant would be returned, not  a
    comparison to the life they would enjoy were they to remain here. As to
    cultural barriers, the guidance explains that these might  be  relevant
    in situations where the partner would be  so  disadvantaged  that  they
    could not be expected to live in that country. "It must  be  a  barrier
    which either cannot be overcome or would present a very high degree  of
    hardship to the partner such  that  it  amounts  to  an  insurmountable
    obstacle."


14. Paragraph 3.2.8 of the  Guidance  covers  "Exceptional  circumstances",
    where an applicant does not meet the requirements of  the  rules  under
    Appendix FM. If that is  the  case  refusal  of  the  application  will
    normally be appropriate, but leave can be  granted  outside  the  rules
    where exceptional circumstances apply.


       "Where an applicant fails to meet the  requirements  of  the  rules,
       caseworkers must go on to consider  whether  there  are  exceptional
       circumstances."


15. The Guidance continues  that  exceptional  does  not  mean  unusual  or
    unique. While all cases are to some extent unique, those unique factors
    do not generally render them exceptional. A  case  is  not  exceptional
    just because the criteria set out in EX.1  of  Appendix  FM  have  been
    missed by a small  margin.  Rather,  the  Guidance  reads,  exceptional
    "means circumstances in which refusal  would  result  in  unjustifiably
    harsh consequences for the individual or their family such that refusal
    of the application would not be proportionate. That is likely to be the
    case only very rarely." The paragraph  continues  that  in  determining
    whether there are exceptional circumstances,  the  decision-maker  must
    consider all relevant factors, such as:

       "a) The circumstances around the applicant's entry to the UK and the
       proportion of the time they have been in the UK legally  as  opposed
       to illegally. Did they form their relationship with their partner at
       a time when they had no immigration status or this  was  precarious?
       Family life which involves the applicant putting down roots  in  the
       UK in the full  knowledge  that  their  stay  here  is  unlawful  or
       precarious, should be given less weight, when balanced  against  the
       factors weighing in favour of removal, than family life formed by  a
       person lawfully present in the UK.
       b) Cumulative factors should be considered. For example,  where  the
       applicant has family members in the UK but their  family  life  does
       not provide a basis for stay and they  have  a  significant  private
       life in the UK. Although under the rules  family  life  and  private
       life are considered separately, when considering whether  there  are
       exceptional circumstances private and family life can be taken  into
       account."


16. This all concerns family  life.  The  requirements  to  be  met  by  an
    applicant for leave to remain on the grounds of private  life  are  set
    out in paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.  The  applicant  must
    satisfy the suitability requirements and make a valid  application.  As
    well, the requirements are that at  the  date  of  the  application  an
    applicant, inter alia,


       "(vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously  in  the  UK
       for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)  but
       has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the  country
       to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK".

(b) The case-law


17. The case law on Article 8 is vast.  With the daily burden  of  deciding
    cases Tribunal judges face an unenviable task of keeping track  of  its
    frequent twists and turns.  We do not intend to add to the problem.  We
    need cite only three  cases  which  concern  the  status  of  the  2012
    Immigration Rules and the role of Article 8 of the Convention.


18. MM v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  1900
    (Admin) was the case referred to by the judge  below.   It  involved  a
    direct  attack  on  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.1  of  the  Immigration   Rules
    concerning the maintenance requirements for the admission  of  partners
    to the United Kingdom, including the minimum income level  of  �18,600.
    In a judgment evidencing great learning, Blake J held that,  while  the
    maintenance requirements had a legitimate aim, they could be so onerous
    in  their  effect  as  to  be  an  unjustified   and   disproportionate
    interference with Article 8 ECHR rights.  However,  he  concluded  that
    since the requirements of the rules in this respect could be Article  8
    compliant they should neither be quashed nor  made  the  subject  of  a
    declaration, but  that  "claims  of  individual  violations  should  be
    examined in the context of an application when the relevant  facts  can
    be established and the factors weighed in the balance": [120].


19. In the course of his judgment Blake J concluded that the  Secretary  of
    State was entitled  to  conclude  that  a  somewhat  higher  level  was
    required  than  the  bare  subsistence   level   set   under   previous
    interpretations of the Rules.  The Secretary of  State  had  considered
    matters such as the interests of  promoting  the  economic  and  social
    welfare of the whole community, giving the foreign  partner  sufficient
    resource to develop skills and community ties, and combating a negative
    view of family migration based  on  densely  occupied  extended  family
    homes operating at a very basic level of economic sustainability: [89]-
    [90], [110].   Blake  J  referred  to  the  �13400  gross  annual  wage
    identified by the Migration Advisory Committee, which was close to  the
    adult minimum wage for a 40 hour week.  To  set  a  higher  figure,  he
    said, effectively denied many young people  and  low-wage  earners  the
    ability to be joined by foreign spouses, which frustrated the right  of
    British citizens and refugees to live with their chosen partner  unless
    they had substantial savings: [126], [147]-[148].


20. More generally, Blake J said that an applicant had to be able to  raise
    an Article 8 case separately from the Immigration  Rules:  [152]-[153].
    That was partly because he  was  not  persuaded  that  the  exceptional
    circumstances  route  was  sufficient  to  render  the  decision-making
    process as a whole lawful and  compatible  with  the  Convention.   The
    court had also to examine whether the rules were Convention  compatible
    and reflected the appropriate balance as to Article  8  rights,  rather
    than leaving the issue to the exiguous discretion to  depart  from  the
    rules.  Further, where the terms  of  the  policy  were  themselves  so
    severe and inflexible as to be a disproportionate interference with  an
    important right, the existence of an imprecise residual  discretion  to
    depart from them would not suffice to achieve Convention compatibility.




21. In the course of his judgment in MM, Blake J made passing reference  to
    R (on the application of Nagre) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWHC  720  (Admin).  There  Sales  J  considered  the
    relationship between the 2012 Immigration Rules in relation  to  claims
    for leave to remain and Article 8. In a careful judgment, Sales J  said
    that since the new Guidance recognised a discretion to grant  leave  to
    remain outside the rules, the new rules contemplated that  there  would
    be cases falling outside them in which  a  right  to  remain  could  be
    established: [28].


       "[29] Nonetheless, the new rules do provide better explicit coverage
       of the factors identified in case-law as  relevant  to  analysis  of
       claims under Article 8 than was formerly the position,  so  in  many
       cases the main points for consideration in  relation  to  Article  8
       will be addressed by decision-makers applying the new rules.  It  is
       only if, after doing that, there remains an arguable case that there
       may be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  the  Rules
       by reference to Article 8 that it will be necessary  for  Article  8
       purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are   compelling
       circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  the  new  rules  to
       require the grant of such leave."

         Thus the rules were lawful: [35]-[36].  On  a  thorough  review  of
    the Strasbourg guidance, Sales J concluded that in a precarious  family
    life case only in exceptional circumstances would removal of  the  non-
    national family member constitute a violation of Article  8.   To  show
    that, despite the absence of insurmountable obstacles  to  removal,  it
    would nonetheless be disproportionate, it would be  necessary  to  show
    other non-standard and particular features of the case of a  compelling
    nature demonstrating that removal would be unjustifiably harsh: [42].


22. Thus Sales J held that the gap between the test  for  leave  to  remain
    under  EX.1(b)  and  the  result  one  would  arrive   at   by   direct
    consideration of Strasbourg case-law  in  the  precarious  family  life
    class of case was likely to be small: [43]. In  the  majority  of  such
    cases, where the Secretary of State concluded that  the  family  member
    applying for leave to remain could not  satisfy  the  test  in  Section
    EX.1(b) (insurmountable obstacles) in the new rules,  it  was  unlikely
    that there would be a good arguable case, let alone a  case  ultimately
    found to be established, that Article 8 would  require  that  leave  to
    remain should  be  granted  outside  the  Immigration  Rules:  [48]  In
    particular Sales J held that Section EX.1 was not unlawful: [36].  Thus
    the Secretary of State was entitled to  refuse  Nagre  (an  overstayer)
    leave to remain as the unmarried partner of  a  British  citizen  under
    EX.1 without going outside the rules: [[50].


23. Our third case is MF (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1192, where the Court of  Appeal  held  that
    the Immigration Rules of 2012, as they  apply  to  a  foreign  national
    criminal, are a  complete  code:  [44].  Paragraph  398  of  the  rules
    provides that if the specific conditions of paragraphs 399 or  399A  do
    not apply in relation to a foreign national  criminal,  in  exceptional
    circumstances the public interest in deportation may be  outweighed  by
    other factors. "Exceptional" used in the context of  foreign  prisoners
    was a recognition that very compelling reasons  would  be  required  to
    outweigh the public  interest  in  deportation:  [40]-[43].  Sales  J's
    analysis in Nagre of the concept of  exceptionality  was  approved.  In
    obiter remarks the court said that if "insurmountable"  obstacles  were
    literally obstacles which it is impossible to surmount, their scope was
    very limited indeed and that, for  the  reasons  stated  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal (Blake J, Lord Bannantyne  and  UT  Judge  Storey)  in  Izuazu
    (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT  00045  (IAC),  [53]-[59],  such  a
    stringent approach would be contrary to Article 8: [49]. On  the  facts
    of the appeal, the Upper Tribunal's careful  weighing  of  factors  and
    decision against deportation in that case was upheld: [50].


24. Drawing the threads together,  and  not  without  some  difficulty,  we
    conclude that on the current state of the authorities:


    (a) the maintenance  requirements  of  E-LTRP.3.1-3.2  stand,  although
    Blake J in MM (now under appeal) said that  they  could  constitute  an
    unjustified and  disproportionate  interference  with  the  ability  of
    spouses to live together; he suggested that an appropriate  figure  may
    be around �13,400, and highlighted the position of young people and low-
    wage earners caught by the higher figure in the rules;


    (b) after applying the requirements of the rules,  only  if  there  may
    arguably be good grounds for granting leave to remain outside  them  is
    it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on to consider whether  there
    are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  under  them:
    Nagre;


    (c) the term "insurmountable obstacles" in provisions such  as  Section
    EX.1 are not obstacles which are impossible to surmount: MF  (Nigeria);
    they concern the practical possibilities of relocation.  In the absence
    of such insurmountable obstacles, if removal is to be  disproportionate
    it is necessary to show  other  non-standard  and  particular  features
    demonstrating that removal will be unjustifiably harsh: Nagre.

The appeal

25. In seeking to uphold the First-tier Tribunal's  decision,  Ms  Peterson
    for the respondent submitted that there was no need for the  respondent
    to establish that her case was exceptional. The test was whether it was
    reasonable.   The  judge  was  correct  in  undertaking  an  Article  8
    analysis. The finding  that  the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  was
    disproportionate should be respected. The case fell into  the  category
    of case in MM, in that the  impact  of  the  maintenance  criteria  was
    disproportionate,  irrational  and  unjustifiable.  The  issue  is  not
    whether the respondent is in the same position as any other person  who
    cannot meet the requirements of the Rules and thus not exceptional, but
    whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances for her to return  to
    Pakistan to apply for entry clearance.  It was not  acceptable  that  a
    British pensioner should not live here without his wife. As  the  judge
    stated, the Secretary of State has not  been  able  to  show  that  the
    respondent would not meet any of conditions of the rules apart from the
    maintenance requirements. The judge's findings were  open  to  him  and
    should not be set aside.


26. In our respectful  view  the  judge  was  in  error  in  his  analysis.
    Certainly it was accepted that the respondent did not qualify under the
    Immigration Rules. But that did not mean that they could be passed over
    without analysis. The rules should have been the  starting  point,  not
    least because the  Secretary  of  State  rested  her  decision  -   the
    decision the respondent was appealing - on the rules. Important in  our
    view is that the respondent not only fell short of the rules, but  fell
    short by a very considerable margin. Indeed, the income figure did  not
    even approach the �13,400 income per annum  level  which  Blake  J  had
    identified in MM as a more acceptable starting point, and which he  had
    highlighted because of  the  position  of  young  people  and  low-wage
    earners. Here the pension income  of  the  husband  is  �7,420.40,  the
    respondent's savings are relatively modest and neither  the  respondent
    nor he works.  The respondent will qualify for pension credits  if  she
    settles here but this will boost that figure only slightly.


27. The  judge  then  embarked  on  a  free-wheeling  Article  8  analysis,
    unencumbered by the rules.  That  is  not  the  correct  approach.  The
    Secretary of State had addressed the Article 8 family  aspects  of  the
    respondent's position through the rules, in particular  EX.1,  and  the
    private life aspects through paragraph 276ADE. The  judge  should  have
    done likewise, also paying attention to the Guidance.  Thus  the  judge
    should have considered the Secretary of State's conclusion  under  EX.1
    that there were no insurmountable obstacles preventing the continuation
    of family life outside the United Kingdom. Only if there were  arguably
    good grounds for granting leave to remain  outside  the  rules  was  it
    necessary for him for Article 8 purposes to go on to  consider  whether
    there were compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised  under
    the rules (see paragraph 24(b) above).


28. On the judge's own findings this was a very run of the mill  case  with
    no compelling circumstances. The respondent applied when a  visitor  so
    fell outside Appendix FM. She has long  been  married  to  someone  who
    relatively recently became a British citizen. There was the claim  that
    the husband needed the respondent to care for him but the judge did not
    accept that the medical evidence supported this.  The  reality  in  our
    view is that it was convenient for many years for the husband  to  come
    to the United Kingdom to remain unlawfully, and for the  respondent  to
    be with her daughters in Pakistan. That  was  the  choice  this  couple
    made. The daughters are now married and off the respondent's hands with
    their own husbands in Pakistan. Obviously the constant travel back  and
    forth is expensive and probably more  tiring  as  the  respondent  gets
    older. But the husband is now settled here and can himself travel  back
    and forth to Pakistan.  He has the advantage here of a  state  pension,
    pension credits, housing benefit, and council tax  benefit.  Of  course
    some of that would not be transferable to Pakistan were  he  to  return
    there permanently.  The respondent's suggestion that the husband  could
    not live in Pakistan because he has been here for some decades - on our
    calculation less than a third of his life - is unsustainable.  For  our
    part we cannot see any  insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life  in
    Pakistan or unjustifiably harsh results.


29. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside.  We  re-make
    the decision as follows: the appeal against the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal to vary leave to remain is dismissed.
