Solicitors.
For the respondent:    Mrs Eboni, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

   1. The appellant had been given permission to appeal the decision of
      First-tier Tribunal Judge N Lodge who, in a decision promulgated on 4
      July 2018 dismissed the appellant's appeal against the respondent's
      decision refusing her claim for protection.

   2. The appellant made a claim for protection on 13 August 2015 with her 3
      children as dependents. She said that she was a national of the
      Islamic Republic of Iran.

   3. She said she was born in Kuwait of an Iranian father and a Kuwaiti
      mother. She had lived in Kuwait her entire life. She had married an
      Iranian national and they lived in Kuwait. The appellant is a Shia
      Muslim and her husband is an Arab who follows the Sunni branch of
      Islam.

   4. The claim was that in February 2015 she and her husband and their 3
      children visited Iran. Whilst there, her husband attended a meeting as
      he was involved in an organisation supporting Sunni Arabs. He was
      arrested the Iranian authorities and his whereabouts are now unknown.
      His friend told her of this. He had their passports. She and the
      children relocated within Iran before leaving illegally 3 months
      later.

   5. The respondent accepted the appellant is Iranian but did not accept
      the authorities had any interest in her. Her account about her
      husband's activities was considered to be vague and her account of
      being informed by his friend was not considered credible.
      Consequently, it was not accepted that she was wanted by the Iranian
      authorities because of any imputed political opinion or on account of
      her husband's claimed activities. It was accepted that she had left
      Iran illegally, travelling overland into Turkey, but it was not
      accepted that this would expose her to persecution. The respondent
      also took the view that she would be entitled to Kuwaiti citizenship.

   6. Regarding her article 8 rights, the respondent took the view that she
      could reintegrate into life in Iran. The Khuzestan province had
      between 2.5 and 5 million Arabic speakers and her husband had family
      there. The appellant also raised medical conditions she and her
      daughter had but the respondent concluded article 3 or 8 were not
      breached. Regarding section 55 the view was there would be medical
      treatment available for her daughter and the condition was not life-
      threatening.

The First tier Tribunal

   7. The appellant gave evidence and said she was unaware of her husband
      political activities but knew he helped people in Iran. The judge did
      not find this credible and rejected the claim about her husband's
      friend helping her leave. The judge questioned why she would come to
      the United Kingdom rather than return to Kuwait with her children. The
      judge concluded by stating the appellant was not credible.

   8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis it was arguable the
      judge erred in stating the appellant was an Arab entitled to Kuwaiti
      citizenship.

At hearing.

   9. Mr Khan referred me to paragraph 54 of the decision of First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Lodge. This reflects the presenting officer's
      submission that the appellant and her children could return to live in
      Kuwait, with the judge concluding she is entitled to Kuwaiti
      citizenship and that she has discarded her Kuwaiti passport to avoid
      the possibility of return. Mr Khan submitted that this was a material
      error of law in that the appellant did not have Kuwaiti citizenship.
      The grounds set out how a 3rd country national can acquire Kuwaiti
      citizenship. He submitted this did not cover the appellant situation.
      In particular, she is not an Arab.

  10. Mr Khan's point also links with the judge's comments at paragraph 44.
      The appellant's credibility was an issue. The judge said he found it
      extraordinary that having a right of residence in Kuwait and having a
      Kuwaiti passport she and her children would make the long and
      difficult journey to the United Kingdom rather than return to Kuwait.
      Mr Khan said the appellant's claim was that she held an Iranian
      passport which was endorsed with a Kuwaiti residence permit which had
      been seized by the Iranian authorities.

  11. In response, Mrs Eboni accepted that Mr W Khan had demonstrated a
      material error of law. This primarily related to the judge's apparent
      assumption that she was entitled to Kuwaiti citizenship. The decision
      was therefore premised upon error of fact, with the judge stating she
      had a Kuwaiti passport. This was never her claim. Her claim was that
      she had simply a right of residence. Paragraph 13 of the refusal
      letter sets out her claim that she is a national of Iranian who had
      lived in Kuwait all her life. She also claimed her husband was an
      Iranian national of Arab ethnicity who was living in Kuwait.

  12.  Mrs Eboni made the point that the judge may have been led into error
      by the appellant's representative at hearing. This may well have been
      the case as I note the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal at
      paragraph 1 refer to the appellant facing discrimination if returned
      on account of being an Arab. This is reflected at paragraph 50 and 51
      of the decision.

  13. Mr W Khan in concluding pointed out that the judge had not considered
      the risk because she had left Iran illegally. Whilst the case law
      suggests this would not necessarily place at risk it should have been
      considered (SSH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker) Iran CG
      [2016] UKUT 00308 (IAC), SB (risk on return-illegal exit) Iran CG
      [2009] UKAIT 00053 et al.)




Conclusion.

  14. I agree with both representatives that the decision materially errs in
      law and cannot stand. The judge has mistakenly referred to the
      appellant as being of Arab ethnicity and has apparently assumed she
      holds dual nationality. The judge has referred to her having a Kuwaiti
      passport which was not the claim made. I note one of the witnesses
      called at the appeal said he had lived in Kuwait and knew the
      appellant and her husband. He was asked by the judge about his status
      in Kuwait. His response was similar to that claimed for the appellant,
      namely, he never had a Kuwaiti passport but had a residence stamp in
      his Iranian passport. This evidence could have provided an alert for
      the judge about the appellant's position.

  15. At 1.13 on the appellant's screening interview she said she was in an
      Iranian national. At1.15 she said she had a permit to reside in
      Kuwait. She said their passports had been taken by the Iranian
      authorities. She repeats that she is an Iranian national in her
      statement and that she has siblings also borne in Kuwait who also are
      Iranian nationals. She goes on to state that her children were also
      borne in Kuwait and are Iranian nationals. Her husband was born in
      Iran. In her substantive interview she repeats that she is an Iranian
      national and paragraph 95 states that her father who is in his late
      60s was never granted naturalisation in Kuwait but the family had
      permits to reside. Authenticated birth certificates issued by the
      Iranian authorities had been submitted. Clearly, the appellant has
      consistently made the case that she is an Iranian national. This was
      accepted in the refusal letter.

  16. Paragraph 57 of the refusal letter concludes that the appellant meets
      the eligibility requirements for Kuwaiti citizenship. This is
      disputed. However, the refusal letter does not go on to state the
      significance of dual nationality in relation to the claim and so the
      judge may have overlooked this point.

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge materially errs in law and
cannot stand. None of the previous findings are preserved and the matter is
remitted for a de novo hearing to the First-tier Tribunal.

Directions.

   1. Relist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal at Birmingham
      excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge Lodge.
   2. None of the previous findings are preserved but it is common case the
      appellant is an Iranian national.
   3. An issue arising is whether she is entitled to dual nationality with
      Kuwait. To this end, the appellant's representative indicated they
      will consider instructing an expert on nationality law. If so, this
      should include comment on whether the appellant in her own right would
      be entitled to dual nationality or if this could be achieved following
      her husband's line: it being accepted he is of Arab ethnicity.
   4. For the relisted hearing the appellant's representatives should
      prepare a skeleton argument. This should include addressing the
      significance of dual nationality to the claim and submissions as to
      the appellant's entitlement.
   5. It is anticipated the hearing should take no more than 2 � hours
   6. An Arab (Middle Eastern) interpreter will be required.
