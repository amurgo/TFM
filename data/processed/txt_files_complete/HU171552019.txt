Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Ul-Haq instructed by J M Wilson Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Athwal ('the Judge')  promulgated  on  11  September
        2020 in which the Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  on  human
        rights grounds.
     2. Permission to appeal was granted by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin
        sitting as a judge of the First-tier Tribunal on  1  October  2020,
        the operative part of the grant being in the following terms:


        2.   It is arguable, as set out in the grounds, that the judge  has
             failed to deal adequately with the wealth  of  evidence  about
             the  appellant's  serious  mental  health  condition   or   to
             understand the nature of paranoid schizophrenia  which  is  an
             enduring, relapsing and remitting illness without a  cure  and
             which is controlled by medication and support, which  in  this
             case is considerable and despite that he has relapsed  several
             times, including in 2020.



Error of law


     3. The Judge sets out the  findings  and  reasons  from  [27]  of  the
        decision under challenge. At [36] the Judge writes:


        36.  It is for the Appellant to prove that  there  are  substantial
             grounds for believing that he is a seriously  ill  person  who
             faces a real risk of being exposed to  a  serious,  rapid  and
             irreversible decline in his state of health which would result
             in intense suffering or a significant reduction  in  his  life
             expectancy. The most recent letter of June 2020 from Ms  Isaac
             states the aim of supported accommodation is to 'maximise  his
             independence'. It is not  known  whether  this  aim  has  been
             achieved or not because there is an  absence  of  any  medical
             evidence that addresses his current condition.  The  Appellant
             was on a Aripiprazole but his aunt has stated he is  on  depot
             but there is no medical evidence before me that sets out  what
             medication and treatment he is  currently  receiving.  It  may
             well be the case that the Appellant remains  a  seriously  ill
             person,  but  there  is  no   recent   medical   evidence   to
             substantiate this. The witnesses have all informed me that the
             Appellants condition  has  changed,  clearly  for  the  better
             because he is no longer sectioned  in  hospital.  I  therefore
             find, for all these  reasons,  the  Appellant  has  failed  to
             discharge his burden.


     4. The Judge goes on to consider, in the  alternative,  in  the  event
        that he is wrong in the primary finding set out at [36], the second
        limb of the test which relates to the absence or lack of access  to
        appropriate treatment in India. At [39 - 41] the Judge writes:


        39.  The Appellant has not discharged  his  evidential  burden  and
             satisfied me that there is an absence of medical treatment  in
             India. There are  mental  health  hospitals  40  km  from  his
             village in India. None of the witnesses were able to  tell  me
             where the Appellant's sister lives in the  Punjab,  but  I  am
             satisfied from the evidence of JK that  she  has  successfully
             accessed clinically approved medical treatment and is able  to
             manage her condition and care for a child whilst  her  husband
             works in Dubai.


        40.  I turn to consider whether the  Appellant  would  be  able  to
             access medical treatment. Mr Birchall's report states that the
             government has legislated for free treatment for mental health
             illness, if that is correct then cost is  not  an  issue.  The
             Appellant has not established why he  would  not  be  able  to
             obtain free treatment and  the  medication  he  requires  from
             there.


        41.  The witnesses state that the Appellant needs to  be  monitored
             for psychotic episodes and his  brother  in  India  cannot  be
             trusted to  care  for  him  and  take  him  to  hospital  when
             required. I was told  by  JSS  that  it  would  be  culturally
             inappropriate for the Appellant to live with  his  sister  and
             that caring for the Appellant may worsen her situation because
             she has a child to care for and her husband  works  away  from
             home. All of the  witnesses  however,  stated  that  they  had
             limited communication with the Appellant's  family  in  India.
             None  of  the  witnesses  have  discussed  management  of  the
             Appellant's condition with his  sister.  The  sister  has  not
             provided evidence or a letter stating that she could not  care
             for her brother and the reasons why.  The  Appellant  has  not
             satisfied me that he would not have a support network that  he
             could access in India.


     5. The appellants grounds of challenge and skeleton argument reads:


        GROUND OF APPEAL


        2. The Appellant advances his  case  with  reference  to  a  single
        ground; The FTTJ materially erred in consideration of  the  medical
        evidence in that: a) she was wrong not to find that  the  Appellant
        suffered from a serious mental health  condition;  b)  because  she
        failed to consider the  wealth  of  evidence  about  what  paranoid
        schizophrenia  is  and  in  particular  that  it  is  an  enduring,
        relapsing and remitting illness without a cure; and c) because  she
        had failed to consider the wealth of evidence  and  had  failed  to
        consider what paranoid schizophrenia is, the FTTJ failed to realise
        that this illness is controlled by a strict  regime  of  medication
        and supported living.


        3. The Appellant will make good on the above ground by reference to
        the following submissions.


        4. The submissions are advanced in the context of  the  declaration
        of the Supreme Court in AM (Zimbabwe) [2020] UKSC 17, [2020] 2  WLR
        1152 ("AM (Zimbabwe)"). Lord Wilson held inter alia at �32 that the
        requisite capacity of evidence to be adduced by the appellant is to
        demonstrate 'substantial' grounds for believing  that  there  is  a
        'very exceptional' article 3 case  because  of  a  'real  risk'  of
        subjection to 'inhuman treatment'. In the event that the  appellant
        has presented evidence to such a standard then the  respondent  can
        seek to challenge it.


        SUBMISSIONS


        i) Failure to treat the Appellant as a vulnerable witness


        5. The FTTJ at �9 states that "[t]he Appellant could not attend the
        hearing because  of  poor  health,  he  is  currently  residing  in
        supported accommodation". The FTTJ has  erred  in  not  considering
        that at an earlier case management hearing on 17 June  2020,  First
        Tier Tribunal Judge Gill excused the Appellant's attendance to give
        evidence on his application that he lacked capacity. There  was  no
        dispute between the parties representatives  and  in  fact  it  was
        agreed that the Appellant was a vulnerable person.


        6. The Appellant's health was  as  such  that  his  attendance  was
        excused by First Tier Tribunal Judge Gill. The failure by the  FTTJ
        to note and consider the above set the  tone  for  the  substantive
        hearing before her on 19 August 2020.


        ii) Failure to understand paranoid schizophrenia


        7. The FTTJ at �2 states that on 23 September 2019,  the  Appellant
        submitted that he suffered from schizophrenia.  At  �27,  the  FTTJ
        notes that the Appellant's medical report  dated  22  March  20191,
        states that "...he is a 44 year old man with a history of  paranoid
        schizophrenia and past admissions under the Mental Health  Act...".
        At �35, the FTTJ on the basis of the  evidence  of  Dr.  Land,  Dr.
        George and Ms. Isaac only, accepts  that  the  Appellant  has  been
        diagnosed with schizophrenia  and  has  been  sectioned  under  the
        Mental Health Act 1983 on four separate occasions, the  last  being
        in June 2020.


        8. The FTTJ has not considered the letter dated 01  April  2019  of
        Ms. Emma Perry addressed to Dr. Hamdy. This  letter  sets  out  the
        assessment by Liaison Psychiatry of the Appellant and the  decision
        to section the Appellant under the Mental Health Act 1983.


        9. It is alarming that the FTTJ in her decision has not  sought  to
        set out what paranoid schizophrenia means. If the FTTJ had done  so
        it would have assisted the FTTJ in understanding the  illness.  The
        medical practitioners and  social  worker  all  addressed  paranoid
        schizophrenia. The FTTJ has materially erred  in  her  approach  to
        this mental health illness.


        10. The FTTJ had before her objective evidence from inter alia  the
        World Health Organisation4 . In failing to understand the  illness,
        the FTTJ has materially erred in not appreciating that this illness
        is  a  chronic  and  severe   mental   disorder   associated   with
        considerable disability; and that  sufferers  are  2-3  times  more
        likely  to  die  early  than  the   general   population.   Stigma,
        discrimination  and  violation  of  human  rights  of  people  with
        schizophrenia is common.


        11.  The  medical  notes  set  out  the   diagnosis   of   paranoid
        schizophrenia and how the Appellant was presenting  himself  during
        hospital admission. These notes were not referred to in the  FTTJ's
        decision.


        iii) Failure to understand the enduring,  remitting  and  relapsing
        nature of the illness


        12. FTTJ materially erred in not considering the  amount  of  times
        the Appellant has been sectioned when reaching her finding that the
        Appellant has not discharged his burden at �36. At the time of  the
        substantive hearing, the Appellant had been sectioned  a  total  of
        four times as noted by the FTTJ at �35. I am  instructed  that  the
        Appellant is currently sectioned.


        13.  At  �31,  the  FTTJ  notes  that  Dr.  George,  a   consultant
        psychiatrist, in a letter dated  12  June  2020,  states  that  the
        Appellant is an inpatient and that "...there  is  a  very  risk  of
        relapse if he is not supported well in the community. In my opinion
        there is a high risk of relapse of  the  psychotic  illness  if  he
        leaves the country and appropriate support is not available."


        14. The FTTJ has not noted that  Ms.  Amy  Isaac,  the  Appellant's
        local authority allocated social worker, in  her  letter  dated  11
        September 2019 had stated that the Appellant's "...recent admission
        to psychiatric hospital was triggered by  the  anxiety  and  stress
        caused by his legal status to remain in the  UK.  Consequently  and
        further stress and anxiety related to his legal status in the UK is
        likely to trigger a relapse, this includes any request to  travel."
        As the Appellant has been sectioned on numerous  occasions  and  is
        currently  sectioned,  the  FTTJ  has  materially  erred   in   not
        addressing this within her findings. At �29, the  FTTJ  notes  that
        Ms. Amy Isaac records from a meeting with  Consultant  Psychiatrist
        Dr. Wall that Dr.  Wall  confirms  that  the  Appellant  "...has  a
        diagnosed mental disorder, namely  schizophrenia..."  which  "...is
        chronic and will not be cured. He will need  to  receive  treatment
        and support for the rest of his  life."  The  FTTJ  has  materially
        erred in not factoring the above into her findings at �36 where the
        FTTJ finds that there is an absence of medical evidence to  address
        the Appellant's current condition.


        16. The FTTJ states at �35 that she has not been provided with  any
        information about the Appellant's current condition, what treatment
        and medication he is now receiving, how  long  he  will  remain  in
        supported accommodation, where he  will  live  thereafter  and  his
        prognosis. The FTTJ has materially erred  in  not  considering  the
        letter of Ms. Isaac dated 11 June 2020, in which  she  states  that
        the Appellant's mental state remains fragile and  that  his  mental
        state is directly affected by the ongoing legal matters.  The  FTTJ
        has materially erred  in  not  appreciating  and  considering  that
        paranoid schizophrenia is a lifetime illness that  is  fragile  and
        can ignite at any stage.


        17. Furthermore, the FTTJ's comment at  �43  that  the  Appellant's
        condition is no longer the same  as  it  was  sixteen  months  ago,
        demonstrates a lack of understanding of the enduring, remitting and
        relapsing nature of the Appellant's illness.


        iv) Failure to appreciate that treatment encompasses medication AND
        supported living
        18. FTTJ failed to  understand  that  the  treatment  for  paranoid
        schizophrenia involves community support  and  assisted  living  as
        well as medical  treatment.  This  is  set  out  not  only  in  the
        objective evidence of the World Health Organisation9  but  also  in
        the wealth of medical of evidence. These are in the  form  of  care
        plans and such as in the letter of Dr. George dated  12  June  2020
        who describes the Appellant needing support from the Home Treatment
        team and follow-up care  from  the  Community  Mental  Health  Team
        Services. The FTTJ it appears at �13 has underestimated the  nature
        of the support provided by the Appellant's  aunt.  The  Appellant's
        aunt is the  primary  carer  of  the  Appellant  and  part  of  the
        emotional support network that the wealth of  evidence  identifies.
        The description adopted by the FTTJ cannot be reconciled  with  the
        FTTJ's note  and  acceptance  of  the  evidence  at  �29  that  the
        Appellant needs 24/7 ongoing support from his family and support of
        the community mental health services.  The  ongoing  and  continued
        support forms part of  the  Appellant's  treatment.  The  FTTJ  has
        materially erred in not considering this in her findings that there
        is not an absence of treatment in India.


        v) Failing to attach any weight whatsoever to the medical report of
        Dr. Hanna.


        21. At �34 the FTTJ states that she can only attach limited  weight
        to Dr. Gabra Hanna's medical reports dated  26  June  2019  and  12
        September 2019 because Dr. Hanna had not considered the Appellant's
        medical records, not clarified how long he assessed  the  Appellant
        for and in what conditions, and for not stating what  expertise  he
        has to allow him to comment on  what  treatment  or  medication  is
        available in India. Dr. Hanna's reports can be found at B1  and  G1
        of the respondent's bundle. It is submitted that the FTTJ was wrong
        to attach 'limited weight'. Rather than limited weight  it  appears
        that the FTTJ has attached zero weight presumably on the invitation
        of the respondent on the purported basis that  Dr.  Hanna  did  not
        have the medical records of the Appellant.


        22. Dr. Hanna is the fourth psychiatrist to discuss the Appellant's
        mental health condition in the wealth of evidence. The others being
        Dr. Land, Dr. George and Dr. Wall. The FTTJ accepted  the  evidence
        of Dr. Land and Dr. George and also the evidence of Ms. Isaac which
        referred to Dr. Wall. The FTTJ has accepted their  evidence  whilst
        unfairly disregarding Dr. Hanna's evidence.


        23. The FTTJ notes at �32 that Dr. Hanna assessed the Appellant  at
        the Oleaster Psychiatric Unit on 29 May 2019  where  the  Appellant
        was an in-patient. Dr. Hanna was accompanied by a registered mental
        health nurse at the assessment of the Appellant10  .  Dr.  George's
        letter dated 12 June 2019 confirms the treatment and support he was
        receiving as an inpatient at the time of  Dr.  Hanna's  assessment.
        The FTTJ ought to have considered  the  corroborative  evidence  as
        support for the weight to attach to Dr. Hanna's evidence. Dr. Hanna
        had knowledge at the time of the assessment that the Appellant  was
        an inpatient and of the treatment and support he was receiving. The
        FTTJ  simply  cannot  disregard  medical  evidence.  The  FTTJ  has
        unfairly singled out Dr. Hanna and not  considered  the  wealth  of
        evidence in the round.


        24. The  FTTJ  in  criticising  Dr.  Hanna  for  not  stating  what
        expertise he has to allow him  to  comment  on  what  treatment  or
        medication is available in India has not considered  what  in  fact
        Dr. Hanna had stated. Dr Hanna whilst  discussing  the  Appellant's
        current medication, simply comments that "...[I]f  this  medication
        is available in India, it is likely to be very costly."


        vi) Failure to consider the social stigma in  India  and  the  non-
        availability of treatment for those with paranoid schizophrenia.


        25. The FTTJ materially erred  in  not  considering  the  objective
        evidence of the perception of those suffering  from  mental  health
        illnesses such as paranoid schizophrenia in  India.  The  objective
        evidence included that of Human Rights Watch which highlighted  the
        morbid practices and treatment administered to those  with  certain
        medical health conditions in psychiatric hospitals in India12;  and
        the Royal College of Psychiatrists which highlighted  some  of  the
        abuse  perpetuated  against  those   suffering   from   psychiatric
        disorders.


        26. The FTTJ at �37 placed reliance on the information provided  by
        the  respondent's  representative  that  there  were  a  number  of
        psychiatric hospitals in Jullundur, which  it  was  agreed  was  40
        kilometres from the Appellant's home village. The  FTTJ  materially
        erred in not scrutinising the information, especially in  light  of
        the objective evidence before her regarding  psychiatric  hospitals
        in India. The FTTJ has also failed to consider the  letter  of  Ms.
        Isaac dated 11 June 2020 in which she expresses her grave  concerns
        regarding the  Appellant  returning  to  India  without  access  to
        professional and personal support he desperately  depends  on.  Dr.
        George in his letter dated 12 June 2020 also states that there is a
        high risk of the  psychotic  illness  if  the  Appellant  left  the
        country and the appropriate support is not available.


        27. Furthermore, the FTTJ did not correctly apply the  second  limb
        of the test as the FTTJ  describes  at  �37.  The  second  limb  is
        relevant if the Appellant has established a prima facie  Article  3
        claim. The Appellant respectfully submits that he  has  provided  a
        wealth of sufficiently cogent  evidence.  Accordingly,  the  burden
        switches to the respondent to demonstrate that any  medication  and
        treatment the Appellant requires is both available and  accessible,
        what the cost of the medication and treatment  would  be  and  what
        support networks there would be for the Appellant. In  the  absence
        of such a rebuttal, there is a  breach  of  Article  3  unless  the
        respondent can obtain an assurance from the  authorities  in  India
        that the Appellant would be given  the  requisite  treatment.  vii)
        Failure to appropriately consider the risk of flying. The  FTTJ  at
        �42-44 materially erred in not considering the letter of Ms.  Isaac
        dated 11 September 2019 in which she states  that  any  request  to
        travel would likely trigger a relapse as part of  her  analysis  of
        whether the Appellant was at risk of flying.


        viii) Respondent's refusal letter


        29. The FTTJ notes at �3 that the respondent in the refusal  letter
        simply stated that the Appellant did not meet  the  high  threshold
        for Article 3 cases. It is submitted that the reasons  set  out  in
        the refusal letter and the reliance upon  it  as  advanced  by  the
        representative to the FTTJ would not be advanced by the  respondent
        before the First Tier Tribunal today in light of  the  respondent's
        own policy information and the declaration from the  Supreme  Court
        in AM (Zimbabwe).


        CONCLUSION


        30. For one or  all  of  the  above  reasons  it  is  with  respect
        submitted that the  decision  of  the  FTTJ  cannot  stand  and  is
        unsustainable. The Appellant respectfully requests that the  matter
        should be remitted de novo to the First Tier Tribunal for an appeal
        hearing before a Judge other than the FTTJ.

Discussion

     6. The reasons for refusal letter is dated 10 October 2019 and  it  is
        accepted would not be written in the form today that it was at that
        date following the handing down of the  judgement  of  the  Supreme
        Court in AM (Zimbabwe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
        [2020] UKSC 17 on 29 April 2020. Mrs Petterson conformed,  however,
        that she opposes the appeal on the basis  the  findings  made  were
        open to the Judge on the evidence.
     7. The Judge was also aware of AM (Zimbabwe) make  specific  reference
        to that case and the judgement of Lord Wilson between [22 - 25]  of
        the decision under challenge.
     8. The Judges primary finding at [36] that the appellant had failed to
        discharge the burden upon him to show that he is  a  seriously  ill
        person is infected by legal error when one considers the weight  of
        evidence available to the Judge in  the  numerous  medical  reports
        provided.
     9. The appellant clearly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia for which
        he has received both inpatient and outpatient  treatment  including
        being sectioned under the Mental Health Act. One of  the  documents
        in the bundle available to the Judge was a  letter  written  by  Dr
        George, a Consultant Psychiatrist with the Birmingham and  Solihull
        Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, dated 12 June 2020, stating:

[JS] is currently detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act and  has
a diagnosis of a Psychotic Disorder. He is currently  an  inpatient  and  is
treated with antipsychotic medication, nursing  and  psychological  support.
As he is recovering from a Psychotic Disorder, in my opinion he is  not  fit
to appear in Court as well as being cross examined.

Following discharge from hospital, the current plan is for him  to  stay  in
supported accommodation. After discharge  from  hospital  he  needs  support
from the Home  Treatment  Team  and  subsequent  follow  up  care  from  the
Community Mental Health Team services. There is a very high risk of  relapse
if he is not supported well in the community. In my opinion there is a  high
risk of relapse of the psychotic  illness  if  he  leaves  the  country  and
appropriate support is not available.

    10. A letter dated 1 July 2019 confirmed that the  appellant  had  been
        treated as an inpatient within the NHS Mental Health trust since 31
        March 2019 having been detained  under  section  3  of  the  Mental
        Health Act. A letter of 1 April 2019 to the appellant's GP  written
        by a Psychiatric Liaison Nurse states:

[JS] was  assessed  by  Liaison  Psychiatry,  who  identified  ongoing/acute
psychotic  symptoms,  including   hallucinations,   thought   disorder   and
paranoid/delusional beliefs.

He was also refusing psychiatric medication, which was  leading  to  further
deterioration of his mental state.

    11. A further letter before the Judge is that dated 11  September  2019
        written by Amy Isaacs an experienced social worker  of  the  Sutton
        Coldfield Constituency Team who stated she had been involved in the
        appellant's care since 4 July 2019 when she  attended  a  discharge
        planning meeting at George Ward, Highcroft Hospital with Consultant
        Psychiatrist Dr Wall. The letter states "According to Dr Wall  [JS]
        mental disorder is chronic and will not be cured. He will  need  to
        receive treatment and support for the rest of his life. The  letter
        also notes [JS] was "... discharged from psychiatric hospital  back
        into his Aunties address in order that he will receive the  ongoing
        support he requires to remain as mentally stable as  possible.  Any
        threats to [JS] current living situation  is  only  increasing  his
        anxiety  and  likelihood  of  relapse".  The  letter  states   [JS]
        continues to need 24/7 ongoing support  from  his  family  and  the
        support of community mental health services to promote recovery and
        that without such support or a change/reduction in this support  it
        would cause  [JS]  greater  anxiety  and  risk  contributing  to  a
        deterioration in mental  state  and  further  psychiatric  hospital
        admissions.
    12. There was also before the Judge a psychiatric report dated 26  June
        2019 written by Dr Hanna a Consultant Psychiatrist. This report was
        considered by the Judge who in relation to the same wrote at [34]:

        34.  I can only attach limited weight to Dr Hanna's report. He  has
             not considered the Appellant's medical  records.  He  has  not
             clarified how long he assessed the Appellant for and  in  what
             conditions. He has not stated  what  expertise  he  has,  that
             allows him to comment  on  what  treatment  or  medication  is
             available in India.


    13. It was submitted by Mr Ul-Haq that  rather  than  applying  'little
        weight the Judge, in reality, placed no weight on this document.
    14. Dr Hannah clearly  sets  out  his  professional  qualifications  in
        section 1 of the report headed "About The Author". It is clear from
        that Dr Hanna possesses the necessary  professional  qualifications
        to act as an expert witness in this case.
    15. At section 2.2 of the report Dr Hanna writes: "In order to  prepare
        this report I assessed [JS] on 29 May  2019.  The  assessment  took
        place on Tazetta Ward at the Oleaster Unit where [JS] is  currently
        an inpatient. I was accompanied by my colleague Dawn Smith who is a
        Registered Mental Health Nurse.  Prior to  assessing  [JS],  I  met
        with his paternal Aunt [JK] in order to take  a  history  and  gain
        some  collateral  information".  Although  Dr  Hanna  confirms   at
        paragraph 8.1 that he has not been made  privy  to  [JS's]  medical
        records  it  is  clear  that  he  has  had   available   sufficient
        information to set out his opinion as to [JS] illness in section  7
        of the report in the following terms:

        7.1  [JS] presentation is consistent with his established diagnosis
             of schizophrenia. From the  information  available  to  me  it
             appears that his response to treatment for this condition  has
             been limited. He has been a psychiatric inpatient for the last
             8+ months.

        7.2  [JS] is currently experiencing significant  negative  symptoms
             of this condition.  These  include:  poverty  of  thought  and
             speech; apathy and blunted affect. As  a  result  he  requires
             prompting and assistance from staff on the ward to  attend  to
             all of his activities of daily living.

        7.3   The  negative  symptoms  of  schizophrenia  are   notoriously
             difficult to treat and  it  is  likely  to  require  long-term
             support from those around  him.  This  support  is  likely  to
             include prompting and assistance with both  his  personal  and
             domestic  activities  of  daily  living  including  medication
             administration.

    16. The diagnosis is in accordance with the other reports available  to
        the Judge and it is not clear why only a 'little weight' was placed
        upon something that on the face of it appears uncontentious. Whilst
        the Judge may have been entitled  to  place  less  weight  upon  Dr
        Hanna's comments  regarding  availability  of  treatment  in  India
        without the report establishing the basis of such  expertise,  that
        does not justify all of the report being effectively dismissed.
    17. At [35] the Judge writes:

        35.  On the basis of Dr Land, Dr George and Ms Isaac's evidence,  I
             accept  that   the   Appellant   has   been   diagnosed   with
             schizophrenia and has been sectioned under the  Mental  Health
             Act 1983 on four occasions, the last occasion  being  in  June
             2020. I also accept that he has in  the  past  been  moved  to
             supported accommodation and from there returned to his  aunt's
             home I was told in oral evidence by the Appellant's aunt, that
             he is currently residing in supported  accommodation.  I  have
             not been provided any information about his current condition,
             what treatment and medication he is now receiving, how long he
             will remain in supported accommodation and where he will  live
             thereafter and his prognosis.

    18. It is not made out the Judges concerns regarding the nature of  the
        information that had been provided is not a finding reasonably open
        to the Judge on the evidence. Whilst in his written submissions  at
        [16], relied upon by Mr Ul-Haq  in  his  oral  submissions,  it  is
        written "... has materially erred in not considering the letter  of
        Ms. Isaac dated  11  June  2020,  in  which  she  states  that  the
        Appellant's mental state remains fragile and that his mental  state
        is directly affected by the ongoing legal  matters.  The  FTTJ  has
        materially erred in not appreciating and considering that  paranoid
        schizophrenia is a lifetime illness that is fragile and can  ignite
        at any stage" it is not made out the Judge did  not  consider  that
        specific piece of  evidence  or  understand  that  the  appellant's
        mental state remained fragile and was affected by the ongoing legal
        issues. The comment by the Judge simple comments that  he  had  not
        been  provided  in  particular  with  information   regarding   the
        appellant's current condition at the date of the appeal hearing, 19
        August 2020. That is an observation clearly available to the  Judge
        about the evidence as a whole.
    19.  I also find it not made out that the Judge did not understand  the
        nature paranoid schizophrenia. Judge clearly had  available  wealth
        of medical evidence and the Judge is not required to  set  out  the
        nature of that evidence or make  findings  upon  the  same  in  the
        decision under challenge.
    20. Reference was made during the submissions  to  an  earlier  hearing
        before another  judge  the  First-tier  Tribunal  who  undertook  a
        telephone CMR and who notes in the summary of that hearing,  issued
        on the same date, a number of issues that were agreed  between  the
        parties as follows:

(a) the issues for determination in the appeal are:
            . Article 3 - lack of treatment and care in India
            . Article 8 - physical and moral integrity
            . Article 8 - Private life 276  ADE  (1)(vi)  very  significant
              obstacles
            . Article 8 - family life
            . Contact with family in India

(b) the following concessions were made by the respondent:

            . Mental illness is accepted
            . Indian national

        (c)  Due to the appellant's ill-health he shall not  be  called  to
           give  evidence.  The  Tribunal  should  rely  on   his   witness
           statement.  There  should  be  three  witnesses  called  on  the
           appellant's behalf.
        (d)  Expert medical evidence is required to address the appellant's
           medical   condition,   current   treatment   (including   likely
           suitability of any  other  treatment)  the  effect  on  them  of
           inability to access it.
(e)

    21. Even though the appellant did not give oral evidence he is still  a
        vulnerable witness and was entitled to be treated as such requiring
        the Judge to set out how  the  same  had  been  factored  into  the
        assessment  of  the  appellant's  own   evidence.   Mrs   Patterson
        submission that this issue is not relevant as the appellant did not
        attend court to give oral evidence is noted but that does not  mean
        it can be ignored if some evidence is being given by the vulnerable
        individual. I do not find any error on this point, however,  to  be
        material as  the  decision  of  the  Judge  is  based  upon  expert
        evidence, country evidence, and the material  provided  from  other
        sources rather than from the appellant  alone  that  the  appellant
        fails to establish what way he has been prejudiced by the manner in
        which the Judge treated his evidence. It  is  not  suggested  those
        giving  oral  evidence  should  have  been  treated  as  vulnerable
        individuals.
    22. The Judge makes further comment at [39 -  41]  which  are  set  out
        above about further problems experienced by him  in  assessing  the
        appellant's claim in light of the evidence that was  provided.  The
        Judge notes in particular that it had not been established why  the
        appellant would not be  able  to  obtain  free  treatment  and  the
        medication he requires in India. That finding has not been shown to
        be infected by arguable legal error, per se.
    23. The Judge was clearly  aware  of  the  need  for  ongoing  care  in
        addition to the prescription medication. The Judge records that the
        appellant has a sister in India who herself  has  a  mental  health
        conditions and a brother but concluded by reference to the evidence
        that had been made available that the appellant had  not  satisfied
        the Judge that he would not have a support network  that  he  could
        access in India from these sources, as required.
    24. It is clear that if the appellant  does  not  access  the  required
        medical and practical  assistance  to  monitor  his  condition  and
        provide day to day support and for when he becomes unwell, there is
        a likelihood of there being a real risk of intense suffering in the
        receiving state. The test set out in  Paposhvili,  approved  in  AM
        (Zimbabwe), requires that such  intense  suffering  must  be  as  a
        result of the absence of appropriate  treatment  in  the  receiving
        country or lack of access to such treatment. This is the issue  the
        Judge clearly focused upon  when  considering  the  merits  of  the
        appeal  in  the  alternative;  concluding  that  it  had  not  been
        established that access to required medication or other aspects  of
        support and care had not been shown not to be available in India.
    25. The grounds of  appeal,  with  in  which  the  paragraphs  are  not
        numbered, assert:

"Consideration was not given to the fact that  the  sister's  situation  and
mental health (paragraph 38) in no way illustrates that  the  appellant  has
the same condition, and thus will be  able  to  receive  adequate  treatment
upon return. The judge did not enquire what the sister was suffering on  and
what medication she was receiving. The judge  did  have  sufficient  medical
evidence before him and the two can not be compared so casually."

    26. The Judge undertakes no impermissible conclusion at [38] but merely
        records the evidence. It was not for the Judge to seek out evidence
        in proceedings that are essentially adversarial but  in  which  the
        appellant failed to provide adequate evidence to support the  claim
        that no family member in India will be able to provide the required
        degree of support essential to his welfare. The Judge's finding  is
        clear that insufficient evidence was  provided  to  establish  that
        supported living arrangements would not be  available  to  [JS]  on
        return to India.
    27. The Judge clearly considered the report of John  Birchall  and  was
        aware of the issue of social stigma which  is  illustrated  in  the
        analysis of [JS's] sister's condition at [38]. The  Judge  was  not
        required to set out the content of John Birchall's report and noted
        aspects of that report at [40] set out above.
    28. The assertion the Judge underestimated the relationship between the
        appellant and his aunt's challenges to the Judges assessment of the
        weight  such  evidence  could   be   given   when   assessing   the
        proportionality of removal. At [50] the Judge writes:

        50.  There is  no  doubt  in  my  mind  that  there  was  a  family
             relationship between the Appellant and his aunts and  cousins.
             The care  they  demonstrated  towards  him  when  he  was  ill
             demonstrated an element of dependency which went beyond normal
             emotional  ties.  However,  JK  states  that  the  Appellant's
             condition deteriorated to such  a  degree  that  she  and  her
             family were no longer able to care for him  at  home.  He  was
             sectioned and is now in supported accommodation where he is no
             longer dependent on his family for his day to  day  care.  The
             Appellant's family now visit to the Appellant and provide  him
             with emotional support. The  medical  evidence  addresses  the
             Appellant's situation in June 2020  whilst  he  was  sectioned
             under the Mental Health Act, it does not explain how dependent
             he is on his family now that he  has  settled  into  supported
             accommodation. Dr George in his letter of  1  June  2020  only
             refers to care from NHS support agencies and does not refer to
             any family support that may be  required.  The  Appellant  has
             therefore failed to satisfy me  that  there  is  currently  an
             element of dependency that goes beyond normal emotional  ties;
             that such dependency is likely  to  exist  in  the  very  near
             future; and if so who he will dependent on to assist him  with
             his day-to-day needs and why that person could not support him
             in India.

    29.  In  relation  to  the  proportionality   of   the   decision   and
        consideration of the paragraph 276  ADE  issues  the  Judge  writes
        between [53-56]:

        53.  I can find very little that weighs in the Appellant's  favour.
             For the reasons set  out  about,  the  Appellant  has  not  on
             balance satisfied me that there would be  unjustifiably  harsh
             consequences for the Appellant or a member of his family if he
             was refused leave to remain in the UK. I must also  take  into
             account the fact that  he  does  not  speak  English,  is  not
             financially  independent  and  has  lived  in  the   UK   both
             unlawfully and precariously.

        54.  Weighing on the other side is the public interest in  removing
             him from the UK so that  effective  immigration  controls  are
             maintained. The Respondent must establish that the decision to
             remove is legitimate, taken in pursuit of a legitimate aim and
             necessary and  proportionate  in  a  democratic  society.  The
             Respondent  has  established  this  and  I  therefore   attach
             significant weight to this factor.

        55.  I have balanced these factors for and against the  Appellant's
             removal and  I  am  satisfied  that  the  public  interest  in
             maintaining  effective  immigration   controls   significantly
             outweighs   the   individual   rights   of   the    Appellant.
             Consequently, I am  satisfied  that  the  Appellant's  removal
             would be proportionate.

    30. Whilst the appellant disagrees with that outcome that  is  not  the
        issue. Whilst the family and the  appellant  would  rather  he  was
        allowed to remain in the United Kingdom where he could continue  to
        receive treatment from the NHS to meet his needs when he suffered a
        relapse, rather than have him returned to India where the burden of
        providing such assistance would fall upon family members there  and
        the mental health services in India, that is not determinative.
    31. It is accepted that the appellant suffers a serious  mental  health
        condition through no fault of his own. The Judge was clearly  aware
        of this and of the evidence relating to  the  recurring  nature  of
        such a condition especially for an individual is not compliant with
        their medication. It is not made out  the  depot  medication  which
        takes away responsibility  for  the  individual  to  have  to  take
        medication on a daily basis is not available in India.
    32. I do not find it made out the Judge was unaware  of  the  enduring,
        relapsing, or remitting nature of schizophrenia or that  it  is  an
        illness without cure,  controlled  by  medication  and  support.  A
        reading of the decision clearly shows that these  were  the  issues
        that the Judge was seeking to  address  in  relation  to  which  he
        expresses concerns regarding the nature of the  evidence  that  had
        been made available to support the appellant's claim.
    33. It was not  made  out  the  Judge  conclusion  that  returning  the
        appellant to India will not breach his article 3 rights  or  result
        in  a  breach  of  paragraph  276  ADE  or  be  a  disproportionate
        interference with a protected right pursuant to article  8  on  the
        basis of physical or moral integrity, family or private  life,  are
        findings outside the range of those  reasonably  available  to  the
        Judge on the evidence.
    34. The appellant will clearly be able to continue to  have  access  to
        professional psychiatric care  whilst  he  remains  in  the  United
        Kingdom. It was not made out that appropriate  steps  will  not  be
        taken   throughout   the   removal  process    to    protect    the
        applicant  from  the  any identifiable risk.  In  light   of   such
        precautions  to  be  taken  within the UK and during  removal,  and
        the  existence  of  adequate  psychiatric  care and the findings in
        relation to support networks in  India,  it was not  irrational  of
        the Judge to conclude  that   there   would   be   no   breach   of
        Article  3. It is not made out those responsible for  treating  the
        appellant in the United Kingdom will not be  able  to  liaise  with
        their professional colleagues in India to pass on  the  appellant's
        medical notes or to ensure that he be seen and able to access  care
        upon his return. As the Judge noted the evidence provided  was  not
        sufficient to establish the appellant  would  not  have  a  support
        network he could  access  in  India  which  is  a  finding  clearly
        available to the Judge on the evidence.
    35. The Judge's findings in relation the fitness to fly issue have  not
        been shown to be outside  the  range  of  those  available  on  the
        evidence.
    36. Notwithstanding some issues of concern recorded above, I find  that
        the Judge's findings in the  alternative  on  the  basis  that  the
        appellant is suffering a serious mental illness have not been shown
        to be infected by arguable legal error sufficient  to  warrant  the
        Upper Tribunal interfering any further in relation to this matter.

Decision

    37. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.


    38. The First-tier Tribunal made an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of

I make such order pursuant to rule 14 of the  Tribunal  Procedure     (Upper
