Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Duffy. Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer ("the ECO") has been granted permission  to
    appeal against the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Oliver who, by
    a determination promulgated on  8  January  2015,  allowed  Ms  Anene's
    appeal against refusal to grant entry clearance  as  the  spouse  of  a
    person present and settled in the United Kingdom.  As was the  position
    before the First-tier Tribunal, Ms Anene was not  represented  but  her
    husband, Mr Chibuike Okoye, attended and spoke in support of his wife's
    appeal.

 2. Although Ms Anene is the respondent before the Upper Tribunal, and  the
    ECO the appellant, we shall refer to  her  as  the  claimant  to  avoid
    confusion when discussing the determination of the First-tier Tribunal.



 3. Mr Okoye, who is a British citizen, was  married  to  the  claimant  in
    Nigeria on 30 December 2013. Before he returned to the  United  Kingdom
    he assisted the claimant to assemble and  submit  her  application  for
    entry clearance to join him in the United  Kingdom.  The  date  of  the
    application was 17 January 2014.

 4. For that application  to  succeed,  the  claimant  had  to  meet  every
    requirement of the applicable immigration rule.  The  ECO  refused  the
    application because he concluded that two requirements of the rules had
    not been met. The first reason given for refusal, because of an absence
    of evidence of the parties having maintained contact with  each  other,
    was that the ECO did not accept that this was a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship nor that the parties intended to live together permanently
    in the United Kingdom. That objection can be disposed of  shortly.  The
    judge, having heard oral evidence from the claimant's husband, has made
    a clear and unchallenged  finding  of  fact  that  this  is  a  genuine
    marriage and that the parties to it do indeed intend to  live  together
    in the United Kingdom. There is  no  reason  at  all  to  disturb  that
    finding of fact which is therefore preserved. Indeed, having  ourselves
    heard oral evidence from Mr Okoye we are in no doubt at  all  that  the
    judge was correct to make that finding.

 5. It is, therefore, only the second reason given by the ECO for  refusing
    the application with which we are concerned in this appeal. In order to
    meet the financial eligibility requirements of the  immigration  rules,
    the claimant  had  to  provide  certain  documentary  evidence  of  her
    husband's income in the United Kingdom. The ECO refused the application
    because the documentary evidence fell short of what was demanded by the
    rules. In the refusal notice the ECO said this:

         "Appendix FM-SE states that you need to provide wage slips and bank
         statements covering 6 months prior to the date of application and a
         letter from your sponsor's employer confirming the terms  of  their
         employment and  their  salary.  Appendix  FM-SE  also  states  that
         evidence must be dated no more than 28 days before the date of  the
         application and that personal bank statements should cover the same
         period as the pay slips."

    Thus, the requirement was for the claimant to provide evidence  of  her
    husband's income for the period between 17 July  2013  and  17  January
    2014, bank statements for that period and letters  from  her  husband's
    employers, dated  not  more  than  28  days  before  the  date  of  the
    application (and so between 20  December  2013  and  17  January  2014)
    confirming the terms of his employment, including his income.

 6. The claimant, who explained to us that he has  worked  hard  to  ensure
    that he could provide for his wife,  in  fact  held  two  jobs  at  the
    relevant time. He worked as a security guard for a company called Total
    Security Services Ltd ("Total") and as a cleaner for  Apex  Recruitment
    Agency ("Apex").

 7. The ECO accepted that the claimant had submitted her husband's payslips
    from Apex dated between 30 August 2013 until 13 December 2013.  As  the
    earliest of those  payslips  would  have  related  to  the  immediately
    preceding period being worked, it seems probable that,  in  respect  of
    his work as a cleaner, other than the last few days,  those  pay  slips
    covered the whole of the period of 6 months preceding the date  of  the
    application. In fact, the  documentation  before  us  includes  also  a
    payslip from Apex dated  10  January  2014.  We  assume  that  was  not
    provided to the ECO because at the time it would have become  available
    from Apex, the Mr Okoye was in Nigeria, for the purpose of his marriage
    to the claimant.

 8. A real difficulty arose in respect of  the  payslips  from  Total.  The
    applicant needed to rely upon this income  as  well  as  her  husband's
    earning from Apex were not sufficient. The ECO noted that the  claimant
    had submitted a range of pay slips from this company but the only  ones
    that were relevant for  the  purpose  of  the  application,  which  was
    concerned with the income of the claimant's  husband  between  17  July
    2013 and 17 January 2014, were dated from 16 August 2013 to 6  December
    2013. The ECO observed that:

         "None of these pay slips are dated within 28 days before  the  date
         of application or cover a 6 month  period  prior  to  the  date  of
         application."

    Once again' we have before us other payslips from Total relevant to the
    period under consideration and, again, it is not now possible for us to
    say at what stage these were made available by the  claimant.  The  ECO
    recorded also that the bank statements submitted did not  cover  the  6
    month period proceeding the  date  of  the  application.  Finally,  the
    claimant had not provided letters from each of her husband's  employers
    in a format meeting the requirements of Appendix  FM-SE.  The  claimant
    did provide a letter from one of the  employers,  Apex,  but  that  was
    dated 23 August 2013 and so not within 28 days before the date  of  the
    application as was required.

 9. It is clear from paragraph 2 of the judge's determination that  he  was
    aware of the reasons why this application had been refused. He said:

         "... it was argued that the appellant had  not  met  the  financial
         requirements under appendix FM. Not only did the sponsor's combined
         earnings  not  reach  the  required  figure  but  the  evidence  he
         submitted did not satisfy the documentary requirements of  appendix
         FM-SE. The payslips from Apex Recruitment were not dated within  28
         days of the date of application  and  did  not  cover  a  six-month
         period prior to that date. A letter had been provided from only one
         of his employers and was dated more than 28 days before the date of
         application."

    Explaining why, despite that, he allowed the  appeal,  the  judge  said
    that in evidence Mr Okoye:

         "... gave his own calculation of  his  earnings,  putting  them  at
         �19,460 per annum"

    although the claimant's  husband  was  speaking  also  of  his  current
    earning from his new employment with the NHS which  led  the  judge  to
    conclude, at paragraph 10 of his determination:

         "He has now  provided  documentation  over  a  longer  period  than
         required to show that he meets the financial requirements."

10. The ECO has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  because  the  judge
    arguably erred in allowing the appeal on the basis of evidence that did
    not  satisfy  the  requirements  of  the  immigration  rules  and,   in
    particular, not engaging with the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

    The legal framework

11. The immigration rules to be met by persons seeking leave  to  enter  as
    the partner of a person present and settled in the United  Kingdom  are
    found in Appendix FM of the immigration rules. Navigation through those
    provisions is a challenging  task  even  for  experienced  professional
    legal advisors. We do not consider it would be helpful to reproduce  in
    this determination all of  the  relevant  sections  of  the  applicable
    rules. It is sufficient for us to record that the ECO  was  correct  in
    his summary of what was required of the claimant. It  is  important  to
    recognise also that the  requirements  are  mandatory.  The  definition
    provision of GEN 1.2  having  made  clear  that  for  the  purposes  of
    Appendix FM "partner" includes a spouse of the claimant, rule  EC-P.1.1
    provides that

         'Section EC-P: Entry clearance as a partner

         EC-P.1.1. The requirements to be met for entry clearance as a
         partner are that-

          a) the applicant must be outside the UK;

          b) the applicant must have made a valid application for entry
             clearance as a partner;

          c) ...

          d) the applicant must meet all of the requirements of Section E-
             ECP: Eligibility for entry clearance as a partner.'

    Those  provisions  include  financial  requirements.   Rule   E-ECP.3.1
    requires that an applicant  in  the  position  of  this  claimant  must
    provide  Specified  Evidence  that  her  husband,  who   sponsors   her
    application, has a "specified gross annual income of at least �18,600".



12. Appendix FM-SE sets out what is accepted to be Specified  Evidence  for
    the purposes of Appendix SE. This is where  the  requirement  is  found
    that, in order to establish the income requirement has  been  met,  the
    claimant must provide payslips covering a period of 6 months  prior  to
    the date of the application, a letter  from  the  employer  who  issued
    those payslips confirming basic details of the nature and  duration  of
    the employment and bank statements covering the same period as the  pay
    slips showing that that income has been paid into the bank  account  of
    the person employed.  Appendix  FE-SE  also  contains  the  requirement
    relating to the age of the documentary evidence:

         "Where this Appendix requires the Applicant  to  provide  specified
         evidence  relating  to  a  period  which  ends  with  the  date  of
         application, that evidence, or the most recently dated part of  it,
         must  be  dated  no  earlier  than  28  days  before  the  date  of
         application."

13. The refusal to  grant  entry  clearance  was  an  immigration  decision
    falling within section 82(2)(b) of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002. Section 85A(2) provides that, in relation to an appeal
    against such an immigration decision, the Tribunal  may  consider  only
    the circumstances appertaining at the date of  the  decision.  Although
    section 85(4) provides that the Tribunal may  consider  evidence  about
    any matter which it thinks relevant to the substance of  the  decision,
    including evidence which concerns a matter arising after  the  date  of
    the decision, that is expressed to be subject to the effect of  section
    85A.

14. In consequence, while it was open to the  judge  to  consider  evidence
    arising after the date of the decision, he could  do  so  only  to  the
    extent that it illuminated the position as at the date of the decision.



15. Drawing  all  of  this  together,  it  is  readily  apparent  that  the
    determination of the judge discloses legal error.

16. First, it is not possible to discern from  the  determination  on  what
    evidential basis the judge came to the conclusion  that  the  applicant
    had met the financial requirements  of  the  rules.  His  determination
    simply does not identify any evidence upon which it was open to him  to
    conclude that the requirements of the rules had been satisfied.

17. Secondly,  the  judge  failed  to  apply  the  requirement  of  primary
    legislation that in an appeal of this type he was concerned  only  with
    the circumstances appertaining at the date of the decision.  The  issue
    to be resolved was whether at the date of the decision the claimant had
    met those requirements. In order to succeed she  had  to  establish  an
    historic fact, that she had provided the Specified  Evidence  demanded.
    That could be achieved only by pointing to pay slips,  bank  statements
    and employers' letters that pre-dated the application by no  more  than
    28 days, save that such requirement applied to the pay  slips  only  in
    respect of the most recent.

18. It can be seen from the determination that the judge  relied  upon  the
    "calculation of his earnings" provided by  the  claimant's  husband  in
    oral evidence. But that calculation was unsupported  by  the  specified
    evidence demanded by Appendix FM-SE and in proceeding upon  that  basis
    the judge impermissibly disregarded mandatory requirements that had  to
    be met of the application for entry clearance was to succeed.

19. The judge made no attempt to engage with the mandatory requirement that
    the claimant provide the Specified Evidence required  in  the  form  of
    letters from both of the employers, each of which had to be  dated  not
    earlier than 28 days before the date of the application.

20. For these reasons we are satisfied that the judge made an error of  law
    such that his determination must be set aside.

21. Having informed Mr Okoye that we would remake the decision  in  respect
    of the claimant's appeal we invited  him  to  say  whether  or  not  he
    believed he was in a position to produce, now,  pay  slips  for  the  6
    month period proceeding the date of the application  and  letters  from
    both employers dated not more than 28  days  before  the  date  of  the
    application. We were unable to secure from him a clear response and  so
    allowed him time to assemble whatever documentation  he  wished  us  to
    consider when remaking the decision. He returned later on  the  day  of
    the hearing and submitted some further pay slips and asked us  to  look
    at them although these appeared to be mainly the original documents  of
    which copies were already before us.

22. We have examined with the utmost care all of the  documentary  material
    before us. It has to be said that the documentation is in  a  state  of
    complete disarray and it is not possible to be  sure  as  to  what  was
    before the ECO and before the judge. However, doing the best we can, we
    have assembled this evidence in the form it should have been  presented
    in the first place. When this is done, it can be seen, at  least,  that
    the circumstances appertaining at the date of the  decision  were  that
    the claimant was in  fact  able  to  produce  documentary  evidence  to
    establish that her husband's  total  gross  income  was  in  excess  of
    �18,600.

23. As we have said, the claimant's husband, at the date  of  the  decision
    had two jobs. Annexed to this  determination  is  a  schedule  we  have
    prepared of the income earned from each  as  demonstrated  by  the  pay
    slips produced for the period of 6  months  immediately  preceding  the
    date of the application. The fortnightly pay slips during  this  period
    in respect of his work for Apex amounts to �3,802.50 for  the  6  month
    period between 17 July 2013 and 17 January 2014 and the pay  slips  for
    Total �5,721.90. Therefore his gross earned income  was  �9,524.40.  As
    that is for a period of 6 months that is indicative of an annual  gross
    income equivalent to �19,048.80.

24. That is reinforced by an examination of the receipts into his two  bank
    accounts during the same 6 month period between 17  July  2013  and  17
    January 2014. The total of payments  into  his  Santander  account  was
    �5,974.12 and into his Halifax account �4,722.42. Taken  together  that
    is the equivalent of receipts over a period of a  year,  if  replicated
    throughout at the same rate of receipts, of �21,393.08.

25. However, that serves also to illustrate why the rules demand more  than
    simply the production of pay slips. Plainly, some of the receipts  into
    the accounts do not represent earned income because they do  not  tally
    with the amount of the pay slips. It is, no doubt, for that reason that
    Appendix FM-SE demands a  range  of  Specified  Evidence  to  establish
    financial eligibility and not simply the production of pay  slips.  The
    problem for the claimant is that she has not provided letters from  the
    two employers and the one she did  provide  did  not  comply  with  the
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE because it was not dated within 28  days
    of the application.

26. Therefore, despite providing wage slips that appear to demonstrate  the
    required level of gross income, the applicant has failed  to  meet  the
    requirements of the immigration rules  because  she  has  not  provided
    letters from both of her husband's employers, dated not  more  than  28
    days before  the  date  of  the  application,  confirming  the  matters
    required by the rules.

27. By any view, the claimant came very close to meeting  the  requirements
    of the rules. But the appeal cannot be allowed on a "near miss"  basis.
    That much is clear  from  the  stark  provision  of  Section  D-ECP  of
    Appendix FM: if an applicant  meets  the  requirements  set  out  entry
    clearance will be granted; where  an  applicant  does  not  meet  those
    requirements, the application will be refused. Any doubt about that has
    been dispelled by the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in SSHD  v
    SS (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA Civ 387. Richards LJ observed at  the
    beginning of his judgment that the appeals had been listed together  to
    enable the court to give consideration to the  proper  approach  to  be
    adopted to the new immigration rules relating to applications for leave
    to enter by persons who are family members of persons  already  present
    in the United Kingdom.  He said:

         "... Appendix FM constituted an attempt by the Secretary  of  State
         to reflect more precisely than before the relevant  balance  to  be
         struck between the public interest and individual interests for the
         purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.."

    And that:

         "In combination with Appendix FM (which sets  out  the  substantive
         criteria according to which the Secretary of State will  grant  LTE
         or LTR, as the case may be, under the Rules),  another  section  of
         the new rules,  contained  in  Appendix  FM-SE  (Family  members  -
         specified evidence) to the Immigration Rules  sets  out  evidential
         requirements to be satisfied if a claim for LTE or  LTR  under  the
         Rules is made. The effect of Appendix FM-SE is  also  in  issue  on
         these appeals."

    At paragraph 51 he made clear that:

         "... compelling circumstances would have  to  apply  to  justify  a
         grant of LTE or LTR where  the  evidence  Rules  are  not  complied
         with."

    Explaining that:

         "This is for two principal reasons. First, the evidence rules  have
         the same general objective as  the  substantive  rules,  namely  to
         limit the risk that someone is admitted into the United Kingdom and
         then becomes a burden on public resources,  and  the  Secretary  of
         State has the same primary function in relation to them, to  assess
         the risk and put in place measures which  are  judged  suitable  to
         contain it within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given
         to her assessment of what the  public  interest  requires  in  both
         contexts...

         Secondly, enforcement of the evidence rules ensures  that  everyone
         applying for LTE or LTR is treated equally and fairly  in  relation
         to the evidential  requirements  they  must  satisfy.  As  well  as
         keeping the  costs  of  administration  within  reasonable  bounds,
         application of standard rules is an important means  of  minimising
         the risk of arbitrary differences in  treatment  of  cases  arising
         across the wide range of  officials,  tribunals  and  courts  which
         administer the system of immigration controls...

         Good reason would need to be shown why a particular  applicant  was
         entitled to more preferential treatment with  respect  to  evidence
         than other applicants would expect  to  receive  under  the  Rules.
         Moreover, in relation to the proper administration  of  immigration
         controls, weight should also be given to the Secretary  of  State's
         assessment of the evidential requirements needed to  ensure  prompt
         and fair application of  the  substantive  Rules:  compare  Stec  v
         United Kingdom, cited at para. [15] above. Again, if  an  applicant
         says that they should be given  more  preferential  treatment  with
         respect  to  evidence  than  the  Rules   allow   for,   and   more
         individualised consideration of their case, good reason  should  be
         put forward to justify that.

         'Near miss' cases

         ...Contrary to the argument of the respondents, that fact  that  an
         applicant may be able to say that their case is a  'near  miss'  in
         relation to satisfying the requirements of the  Rules  will  by  no
         means show that compelling circumstances exist requiring the  grant
         of LTE outside the Rules. A good deal more than this would need  to
         be shown to make out such a case. The respondents'  argument  fails
         to recognise the value to be attached to having a  clear  statement
         of the standards applicable to everyone and fails  to  give  proper
         weight to the judgment of the Secretary of State, as  expressed  in
         the Rules, regarding what is needed to  meet  the  public  interest
         which is in issue. The 'near  miss'  argument  of  the  respondents
         cannot be sustained in the light of these  considerations  and  the
         authority of Miah v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2012] EWCA Civ 261, especially at [21]-[26]."

28. We have little doubt that the claimant and her husband will feel  upset
    and disappointed at the outcome of this appeal. It appears  to  be  the
    case that Mr Okoye had not appreciated when he travelled to Nigeria the
    full extent of the documentation he needed to provide in support of his
    wife's application for entry clearance and so was unable to provide all
    that was required. But he has demonstrated, at least on the face of the
    payslips, that his income was  sufficient.  That  is  no  answer  to  a
    failure to comply with the Specified  Evidence  requirements,  for  the
    reasons provided by Richards LJ in SS (Congo).  There  was  nothing  to
    prevent the claimant waiting until after her husband  had  returned  to
    the United Kingdom so that he could secure  the  missing  documents  to
    enable  her  to  submit  a  complete  application  compliant  with  the
    requirements Appendix FM-SE.

29. There is, of course, nothing at all to prevent the claimant  submitting
    a fresh application and there is no reason at all to suppose that would
    not be successful. By this determination we uphold the finding of  fact
    of Judge Oliver that this is a genuine and subsisting marriage  and  we
    have made clear that, by any view, Mr Okoye is  a  diligent  individual
    with an established record of employment who will be  able  to  provide
    maintenance and accommodation for his wife should she be granted  leave
    to join him. That is the proper  course  when  an  initial  application
    falls short of what is required. This also was made clear  by  Richards
    LJ at paragraph 57 of SS (Congo):

         "The Secretary of State remains entitled to enforce  the  Rules  in
         the usual way, to say that the Rules have not  been  satisfied  and
         that the applicant should apply again when the  circumstances  have
         indeed changed. This reflects a fair balance between the  interests
         of the individual and the public interest. The Secretary  of  State
         is not required to take  a  speculative  risk  as  to  whether  the
         requirements in the Rules will in fact be satisfied in  the  future
         when deciding what to do. Generally, it is fair that the  applicant
         should  wait  until  the  circumstances  have   changed   and   the
         requirements in the Rules are satisfied and then apply, rather than
         attempting to jump the queue by asking for  preferential  treatment
         outside the Rules in advance."

30. There was no issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  of  whether  there
    should have been consideration outside the rules of rights protected by
    article 8 of the ECHR and no such argument was before us. And nor could
    there be. There is no prospect of such an argument  succeeding  in  the
    circumstances of this appeal, as is made unambiguously clear, again, by
    the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo).

31. For all of these reasons, it is clear that we must substitute  a  fresh
    appeal to dismiss the appeal under the immigration rules.

    Summary of decision:

32. The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal made  an  error  of  law  and  the
    determination is set aside

33. We substitute a fresh decision to dismiss the appeal against refusal to
    grant entry clearance.
