Representation
For the appellant : Miss  M.  Phelan,  counsel,  instructed  by  Immigration
Assist
For the respondent : Mr L. Parker, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    This is an appeal by  a citizen of  Federal  Republic  of  Yugoslavia,
      who  is  from  Kosovo  and  is  of  Albanian  ethnicity,  against  the
      determination  of  an  Adjudicator  (Mr  R.P.  Brittain)   dismissing,
      following a remitted hearing, his appeal on asylum  and  human  rights
      grounds against the decision by the respondent on 5  January  2001  to
      refuse to grant leave to enter the United Kingdom.

2.    The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom at Waterloo  International
      Terminal, having travelled by train from Brussels, on 25  March  1998.
      He was accompanied by his wife and child, who claim as his dependants.
      At an asylum interview on 6 July 2000, he said he had left his home in
      Kosovo to go to Bulgaria on 21 March 1998 and said he had  not  stayed
      in Bulgaria because they were always friendly with Serbs there and  he
      did not stand a chance over there.  He said that the event  which  had
      caused him to leave Kosovo was that the Serbian police had accused him
      of collaborating with the KLA and had sold weapons to them, but  that,
      although he had never done such a thing:  'You can't imagine how  many
      beatings I received because of this' (E10).

3.    The appellant's appeal was first heard  by  an  Adjudicator  (Mr  Paul
      Chambers) on 8 March 2002.  The Adjudicator heard  evidence  from  the
      appellant and a witness. The Adjudicator allowed the appeal on  asylum
      grounds and under Article  3  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human
      Rights. The Secretary of State was granted  leave  to  appeal  to  the
      Tribunal, which, in July 2002,  directed  that  the  appeal  be  heard
      afresh before a different Adjudicator.

4.    The appellant's immigration history  was,  in  fact,  quite  different
      from the account he had given at his  asylum  interview.  The  correct
      position is stated by Miss Phelan  at  paragraph  1  of  her  Skeleton
      argument before us in these words:

             'Arsim Rama left Kosovo for Germany  in  1993,  and  his  then
             fiancï¿½ (sic) Gezime joined in 1995. The couple were married in
             Germany in 1996, and their eldest son,  Drin,  born  there  in
             1997.  (A second son, Edi, was born in February  2002  in  the
             UK).  The appellant's claim for asylum in Germany was  refused
             and in March 1998 arrangements were made  for  their  removal.
             Faced  with  the  prospect  of  removal  to  FRY,  at  a  time
             increasing persecution of  ethnic  Albanians  in  Kosovo,  the
             appellants came instead to the United Kingdom, claming  asylum
             upon arrival in March 1998.  The appellants' asylum claim  was
             not considered until September 2000, when it was refused.'

5.    Although Miss Phelan was unclear about the point, it appears that  the
      appellant revealed the fact that he had spent five  years  in  Germany
      and had been refused asylum there, for the first time in  the  witness
      statement prepared for the hearing before Mr Brittain. At that hearing
      he withdrew his asylum appeal, and the hearing proceeded on the  basis
      of the human rights claim only. Leave to appeal to  the  Tribunal  was
      granted because 'the Adjudicator has failed to consider the Article  8
      claim fully.'

6.    Miss Phelan submitted that the  appellant  enjoyed  a  private  and/or
      family life in the United  Kingdom  and  that  removal  would  not  be
      proportionate. She put before us an extensive bundle of references and
      reports from various persons, including a letter from  the  Member  of
      Parliament for Barking.  Miss Phelan submitted that the appellant  has
      developed extensive ties in the community in the  five  years  he  has
      lived in the United Kingdom, by virtue of  his  work  as  a  volunteer
      translator and interpreter at the Barking and Dagenham Commission  for
      Racial Equality, and his participation in a theatre production. He has
      also undertaken credits towards a NVQ course in hairdressing.  He  and
      his family have made good friends in the United Kingdom  as  evidenced
      by statements and letters. His wife has equally  strong  ties  in  the
      community.  She has also volunteered as a translator  and  interpreter
      at the Barking Commission. She has sought to contribute  to  education
      and to society by successfully completing an  NVQ  Level  2  in  Early
      Years Care and Education.  She  is  now  a  qualified  nursery  school
      assistant, and can contribute a great deal  to  society.   Their  son,
      Drin, now almost seven years old, has lived in the United Kingdom  for
      most of his life. He attends a primary school; according to  the  head
      teacher, he has made a lot of friends and has  an  excellent  academic
      record, as evidenced by a school report. The family speak  English  at
      home and he speaks very little Albanian.  Their child, Edi, now almost
      three years old, was born in the United Kingdom; he speaks English but
      no Albanian. Miss Phelan submitted that the  appellants  have  a  well
      developed  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.  We  accept   that
      submission.

7.    Miss Phelan pointed out that proportionality had not  previously  been
      considered. Matters to be considered in favour of  the  appellant  and
      his family were: they were not illegal entrants or overstayers; at the
      time of their arrival they would not have expected to be  returned  to
      Kosovo; the length of time the family have been there and  the  extent
      of their ties with the community; their work  for  and  value  to  the
      community;  their skills in  interpreting  and  their  willingness  to
      offer their  interpreting  skills  pro  bono;   their  involvement  in
      organising children's activities, Mrs Rama in particular has qualified
      as a nursery assistant and there is  a  shortage  of  such  staff,  in
      particular Albanian speakers; the appellant wishes to work and  is  an
      experienced painter/decorator/carpenter - all trades  in  which  there
      are shortages in the London area; the children are  settled  here  and
      have their friends and lives here - Drin is doing well at school;  the
      family have no home and no relatives to shelter them in Kosovo  (their
      home there has been destroyed);  their extended family are in USA;  an
      extended family network is of high importance in Kosovan  society  and
      lack of such support leads to  severe  disadvantage;  unemployment  is
      high in Vushtrri; the social infrastructure has not recovered from the
      war.

8.    Miss Phelan submitted that the guidance by the Master of the Rolls  in
      Mahmood [2001] ImmAR 229  provided  limited  usefulness  in  assessing
      proportionality in cases of interference with private life. We  reject
      that submission.  We accept the  submission  by  Mr  Parker  that  the
      guidance given at paragraph 55 of the judgment in that case should  be
      followed despite the fact that the Court of Appeal was  there  dealing
      with an illegal entrant.  Mahmood makes it clear that Article 8 of the
      European Convention does not impose on a state any general  obligation
      to respect the choice of residence of a married couple. Article  8  is
      likely to be violated by the expulsion of a member of  a  family  that
      has been long established in a state if  the  circumstances  are  such
      that it is not reasonable to expect the other members of the family to
      follow the members expelled. Whether interference with  family  rights
      is justified in the interest of controlling immigration will depend on
      the facts of the particular case and the circumstances  prevailing  in
      the state whose action is impugned.

9.    In this case the appellant has withdrawn his asylum appeal.  There  is
      nothing in the evidence to suggest that there  is  any  insurmountable
      obstacle to prevent him and  his  family  returning  to  Kosovo.   Any
      return would be of the family as a  whole.   They  have  been  in  the
      United Kingdom since 1998 and have clearly decided that they  wish  to
      continue to reside here. The documentary evidence indicates that  they
      have made considerable efforts to integrate and  establish  themselves
      in the community. They appear to have impressed a considerable  number
      of people, including the Member of Parliament for Barking. The  family
      happily appears to be in good health. The children are both of an  age
      where they can be expected to adjust easily to a new environment;  and
      there is no credible evidence that the parents will be  unable  to  do
      so. We do not find circumstances which persuade us that this is a case
      in which there is good reason to require the United Kingdom to respect
      the choice of residence of the appellant and his family. It is  common
      ground that removal would be in pursuit of a  legitimate  object.   In
      our judgment removal would also be proportionate.

10.   The appeal is dismissed.
