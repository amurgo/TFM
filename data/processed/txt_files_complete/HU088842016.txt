                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD)  appeals  to  the
    Upper  Tribunal  with  permission  against  the  decision  and  reasons
    statement of First-tier Tribunal Judge M B Hussain that was  issued  on
    21 December 2017.

 2. By the time the appeal was called on, there was no appearance by or for
    the respondent.  This was of  no  surprise.   The  respondent's  former
    solicitors notified the Tribunal on 3 April  2018  that  they  were  no
    longer instructed and that the respondent  would  henceforth  represent
    himself.  On  10  April  2018,  the  Tribunal  received  the  following
    communication from the respondent:

    "Further to the notification of the intended Court Hearing on  17/04/18
    relating to myself and the Secretary of State, I write  to  inform  you
    that, due to my financial situation, age and grave  medical  condition,
    I'm neither able to afford legal representation nor fit  to  appear  in
    person.   I  appreciate  the  implications  of  not  being  legally  or
    personally represented at the hearing and  am  willing  to  accept  the
    Court's judgement made in my absence.  Please advise me if any  further
    information or action on my behalf is needed."

 3. I indicated to Mr Bramble that I intended to proceed in the absence  of
    the respondent as permitted by rule  38  of  the  2008  Upper  Tribunal
    Procedure Rules.  The communication from the respondent and his  former
    solicitors confirmed notice of hearing had been properly  served.   The
    respondent consented to the Upper Tribunal proceeding in  his  absence.
    The issues to be determined are those  raised  by  the  SSHD,  who  was
    represented.   Mr Bramble had no objection to proceeding in the absence
    of the respondent.

 4. The SSHD's grounds  of  appeal  focus  on  whether  Judge  Hussain  had
    jurisdiction to review the  discretion  exercised  by  the  SSHD  under
    paragraph S-LTR.2.3.  It was accepted that the respondent had failed to
    pay charges in accordance with the relevant NHS regulations on  charges
    to overseas visitors and that the  outstanding  charges  have  a  total
    value exceeding  �1,000.   In  fact,  the  respondent  originally  owed
    �36,508 for medical treatment, of which (according to a letter from the
    Citizen's Advice Bureau(CAB), Carshalton Branch, over �33,000  remained
    outstanding.

 5. Mr Bramble explained that underlying the grounds are the broad  changes
    made to the rights of appeal from  6  April  2015,  when  s.19  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014 came into force.  From that  point,  the  Tribunal
    has no jurisdiction to review the exercise of discretion.  This follows
    from the fact the  Tribunal  has  no  jurisdiction  to  decide  that  a
    decision is not in accordance with the immigration rules.

 6. I agree with Mr Bramble.  Judge Hussain had  no  power  to  review  the
    exercise of discretion itself.  Of course, Judge Hussain did  not  have
    the benefit of the guidance in Charles  (human  rights  appeal:  scope)
    Grenada [2018] UKUT 89, which explains why Mr Bramble's submissions are
    correct  in  law.   Judge  Hussain's  jurisdiction   was   limited   to
    undertaking a full balancing exercise to determine whether the decision
    was unlawful under s.6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

 7. This leads me to a further difficulty with  the  decision  and  reasons
    statement of Judge Hussain.  He approached the  appeal  as  if  he  had
    jurisdiction to review the decision under the immigration rules.   This
    is evident from the judge's self-direction paragraphs and the  fact  he
    sought, from paragraph 37 of his decision  and  reasons  statement,  to
    review whether the respondent satisfied paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of  the
    immigration rules.  At paragraphs 46 onwards, Judge Hussain  considered
    whether  the  respondent  met  the  suitability   requirements,   again
    demonstrating the judge was reviewing the  decision  in  terms  of  the
    immigration rules.

 8. The problem with this approach is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction
    to decide whether a decision is  in  accordance  with  the  immigration
    rules.  Judge Hussain was  required  to  decide  whether  the  decision
    appealed against was unlawful under s.6 of the Human Rights  Act  1998.
    It is evident from the comment at the end of his decision, that it  was
    unnecessary to consider the article 8 grounds outside the  rules,  that
    he did not carry out the necessary balancing act.

 9. To this extent, I observe that Judge Hussain failed to identify whether
    article 8 was engaged and if so on what basis.   It  would  appear  the
    respondent relied not merely on his private life rights  but  also  his
    family life rights.  It  was  necessary  for  the  judge  to  determine
    whether the respondent enjoyed family life in the  UK  with  his  adult
    daughter and son-in-law.  In carrying out an article 8  assessment,  it
    is necessary to identify the degree to  which  a  decision  to  exclude
    might interfere with a person's private and family life rights.

10. I mention that Judge  Hussain's  reliance  on  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
    meant he focused solely on the respondent's private life  rights.   But
    it is unclear what  private  life  was  established  in  the  UK.   The
    respondent had no right  to  free  medical  treatment.   The  need  for
    medical treatment does not automatically engage  private  life  rights.
    The respondent had arrived in the UK as a visitor.  Although  paragraph
    276ADE starts from the assumption that a person has established private
    life rights in the UK, that is not the starting point under the current
    appeal regime, which requires a "balance sheet approach" if the classic
    Razgar step by step approach is not adopted.

11. In addition, it is  necessary  to  ascertain  the  public  interest  in
    expelling a person.  In  that  context,  whether  a  person  meets  the
    requirements of the immigration rules will be a factor.   However,  the
    changes made to the appeal regime  by  the  2014  Act  mean  that  when
    conducting that exercise the Tribunal cannot go  behind  a  concession.
    Of course, if the immigration rules are in fact met,  then  the  public
    interest in expelling a person will be reduced, often decisively.

12. But the task of the judge does not end with identifying the factors for
    and against the respondent remaining in the  UK.   Once  the  competing
    factors have been identified, the task is to balance them against  each
    other to decide if the personal interests of  the  respondent  outweigh
    the public interests.

13. Unfortunately, Judge Hussain did not carry out  these  tasks.   By  not
    doing so he failed to determine  the  appeal  in  accordance  with  his
    jurisdiction. This means the decision is infected  with  serious  legal
    error and must not only be set aside but the original  appeal  must  be
    remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a hearing  afresh  wherein  the
    human rights issues can be properly considered.

14.  One  final  comment  is  appropriate.   Even  had  Judge  Hussain  had
    jurisdiction to review the exercise of discretion,  he  has  failed  to
    give adequate reasons for reversing the SSHD's decision.  At  paragraph
    53, the judge records the possibility of  a  settlement  being  reached
    between the respondent's daughter and son-in-law with the relevant  NHS
    body to repay the outstanding debt.  But this was merely a possibility.
     There was no evidence that an  agreement  had  been  reached.   It  is
    unclear why the judge concluded  that  the  sponsors  were  willing  to
    settle the debt albeit reluctantly.  He saw they were reluctant to  pay
    the debt, which is also clear from the tone of  the  CAB  letter.   The
    lack of explanation by the judge is further evidence of legal error.


Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal's decision and reasons statement contains  an  error
on a point of law and is set aside.

The appeal is remitted to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh  hearing,
before a judge other than Judge M B Hussain.
