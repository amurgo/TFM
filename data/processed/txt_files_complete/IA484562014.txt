                            Aqeel Hussain Kayani
                       (ANONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mrs Pettersen, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Not present or represented


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I shall refer to the appellant as the respondent and the respondent  as
    the appellant (as they  appeared  respectively  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal).  At the hearing on 29 September 2015, the  appellant,  Aqeel
    Hussain Kayani (who was born on 23 August 1985 and is a male citizen of
    Pakistan), did not attend nor did his representatives do  so.   In  the
    circumstances I have proceeded with the hearing in the absence  of  the
    appellant and his representatives.

 2. First-tier Tribunal (Judge Saffer) in  a  decision  promulgated  on  25
    February 2015, had allowed the appellant's appeal against the  decision
    of the respondent dated 20 November 2014 refusing his application for a
    residence card.  Judge [7] accepted that the appellant and his  partner
    (a Slovakian national) had a  child  together  who  had  been  born  in
    January 2015 and that they  had  established,  by  way  of  documentary
    evidence adduced, that they had been  and  were  continuing  to  reside
    together.  The judge was satisfied that the appellant and  his  partner
    were members of the same household involved in a durable,  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.

 3. The grounds of appeal assert that the judge erred in  law  by  allowing
    the appeal outright.  It is for the Secretary of State to exercise  her
    discretion under Regulation 17(4) of the 2006 EEA Regulations.   Having
    found that the Appellant was  an  extended/other  family  member  under
    Regulation 8(5) the judge  should  have  remitted  the  matter  to  the
    Secretary of State for further consideration and for  the  exercise  of
    discretion under Regulation 17(4).  (Ihemedu (OFMs -  meaning)  Nigeria
    [2011] UKUT 00340 (IAC)).  I find that the judge  did  err  in  law  by
    allowing the appeal outright.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 25 February  2015  is
set aside.   The  finding  that  the  appellant  and  the  partner,  Martina
Peterova have been involved in and continues to be involved  in  a  durable,
genuine subsisting relationship with a Slovakian citizen  shall  stand  (see
decision [7]).  The matter is remitted to the Secretary of  State  in  order
so that she may exercise her discretion under Regulation 17(4)  of  the  EEA
Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed   Date 10 November 2015
