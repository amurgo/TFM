Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr G Lee, Counsel instructed by Kent Immigration &
Visa Advice
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. I refer to the Upper Tribunal's decision  in  error  of  law  dated  25
    November 2017 whereby this Tribunal found a material error of  law  and
    issued directions  for  remaking  of  the  decision  including  hearing
    evidence from a witness not then available.  I rely on the  appellant's
    background set out in that error of law decision which is  appended  to
    this decision and reasons.

Appellant's Claim

 2. The appellant's claim is set out in her witness statements  which  were
    before me.  As indicated in the error  of  law  decision,  the  judge's
    findings at paragraphs 1 to  20  of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal promulgated  on  17  February  2017,  are  preserved.   It  is
    accepted therefore, including by Mr Tufan, that the appellant  and  her
    partner are in a genuine relationship.

 3. In addition, although one of the significant issues before the Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal was that he did not accept  that  it  had  been
    shown that  the  previous  relationships  had  broken  down  (both  the
    appellant and the sponsor having been previously married,  the  sponsor
    still being formally married but not in a relationship with his  wife),
    further evidence has how been produced including  a  witness  statement
    from the sponsor's first wife and the appellant's  divorce  certificate
    and translation.  As a result, Mr Tufan indicated that  the  respondent
    accepted that the previous  relationships  of  the  appellant  and  her
    partner had broken down (as required by E-LTRP.1.9 of Appendix FM).

 4. It was Mr Lee's submission that the relevant Immigration Rules were met
    at the date of the respondent's decision.

 5. The respondent refused the appellant's application under  Appendix  FM,
    five year route, due to not only the lack of evidence that the previous
    relationships had broken down, but  in  addition  in  relation  to  the
    financial requirements not being met and specifically as set out in the
    refusal letter (and discussed at the hearing before me).  The  specific
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE were not met.

 6. I heard oral evidence and submissions from  both  representatives.   At
    the end of the hearing I reserved my decision.

Findings and Reasons

 7. Contrary to  the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  I  am
    satisfied that the requirements of R-LTRP.1.1 are met as follows:

      i) The applicant  must  not  fall  for  refusal  under  Section  S-LTR
         suitability of leave to remain - such was not disputed; and

     ii) The  applicant  meets  all  the  requirements  of  Section  E-LTRP:
         eligibility for leave to remain as a partner.

 8. Paragraphs E-LTRP1.7, E-LTRP1.9 and E-LTRP1.10 of the Immigration Rules
    provide as follows:

         "E-LTRP.1.7. The  relationship  between  the  applicant  and  their
         partner must be genuine and  subsisting  -  on  the  basis  of  the
         preserved findings of the Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Sethi.
         I am satisfied that this requirement is met.

         E-LTRP.1.9. Any previous relationship of  the  applicant  or  their
         partner  must  have  broken  down  permanently,  unless  it  is   a
         relationship which falls within paragraph 278(i) of these  Rules  -
         as already indicated Mr Tufan adopted the position at  the  hearing
         that this requirement was met and I am satisfied that that  is  the
         proper approach on the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal.

         E-LTRP.1.10. The applicant and their partner must  intend  to  live
         together permanently in the UK and, in any application for  further
         leave to remain as a partner (except where the applicant is in  the
         UK as a fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner) and in any application
         for indefinite leave to remain as a  partner,  the  applicant  must
         provide evidence that, since  entry  clearance  as  a  partner  was
         granted under paragraph  D-ECP1.1.  or  since  the  last  grant  of
         limited leave to remain as  a  partner,  the  applicant  and  their
         partner have lived together in the UK  or  there  is  good  reason,
         consistent with a continuing intention to live together permanently
         in the UK, for any period in which they have not done so  -  again,
         on the basis of Judge Sethi's adopted findings I am satisfied  that
         this requirement is met.

 9. In addition, E-LTRP.3.1 and  E-LTRP.3.2(a)  of  the  Immigration  Rules
    provide:

         "E-LTRP.3.1. The applicant must provide  specified  evidence,  from
         the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of -

         (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least -

             (i)  �18,600;

             (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and

             (iii)    an additional �2,400 for each additional child; alone
                  or in combination with

         (b)  specified savings of -

             (i)  �16,000; and

             (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to  2.5  times
                  the amount which  is  the  difference  between  the  gross
                  annual income from the  sources  listed  in  paragraph  E-
                  LTRP.3.2.(a)-(f)  and  the  total  amount  required  under
                  paragraph E- LTRP.3.1.(a); or

         (c)  the requirements in  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.3.being  met,  unless
             paragraph EX.1. applies."

10. It is not disputed that at the date of decision the appellant  did  not
    meet these financial requirements due  to  a  failure  to  provide  the
    specified information required in Appendix FM-SE; Mr Lee submitted that
    she was not well-served by her representatives in this regard.

11. The respondent was not therefore satisfied  that  the  appellant  could
    meet the requirements of R-LTRP1.1(c) for leave  under  the  five  year
    settlement route.  The respondent went on to consider, in  the  Reasons
    for  Refusal  Letter  dated  12  August  2015,  whether  the  appellant
    qualified under Appendix FM EX.1. of the Rules, which required that  an
    applicant must meet all the requirements of R-LTRP.1.1(a), (b) and  (d)
    in order for EX.1. to apply.

12. The requirements of Appendix FM are - LTRP.1.1(d) under  the  ten  year
    route are that -

         "(i) The applicant must not fall for refusal under  Section  S-LTR:
             suitability leave to remain; and

         (ii) The applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-
             1.12 and E-LTRP.2.1; and

         (iii)    Paragraphs EX.1. and EX.2. apply."

13. The requirements of EX.1 and EX.2 are as follows:

         "EX.1.  This paragraph applies if -

         (a)  (i)      The applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with a child who -

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                      continuously for at least the seven years immediately
                      preceding the date of application; and

             (ii)  It would not be reasonable to expect the child to  leave
                  the UK; or

         (b)  The applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
             partner who is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled  in
             the UK or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian
             protection and there are insurmountable  obstacles  to  family
             life with that partner continuing outside the UK.

         EX.1.2  For  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1(b)  'insurmountable
         obstacles' means the very or significant difficulties which are  to
         be faced by the applicant or  their  partner  in  continuing  their
         family life outside the UK and which could not be overcome or would
         entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner."

14. Although it was not disputed before me that the appellant now satisfied
    the eligibility requirements, it  was  conceded  by  Mr  Lee  that  the
    appellant does not have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship,
    at the date of application or indeed  the  date  of  decision,  with  a
    qualifying child in the UK.

15. Therefore, Mr Tufan was correct in his submission,  that  in  order  to
    demonstrate that the appellant met the requirements of Appendix  FM  at
    the date of decision, the appellant  would  need  to  demonstrate  that
    there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  appellant  and  partner
    continuing family life outside the UK which could not be  overcome  but
    would entail very serious hardship for the appellant or their  partner.



16. In reaching my  findings  I  have  considered  the  relevant  case  law
    including Agyarko and Ikuga R (on the applications of) v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 11 which  confirms  that  the
    test of insurmountable obstacles is a stringent one.

17. Mr Lee sought to rely on the findings of Judge Sethi, at  paragraph  37
    of the Decision and Reasons of the  First-tier  Tribunal,  where  Judge
    Sethi was satisfied that the sponsor was a British citizen as  are  his
    children and that the sponsor is fully integrated in  British  society.
    The judge of the First-tier Tribunal  accepted  that  the  sponsor  was
    fully integrated into British society, this is where he  had  his  home
    and business and his children with whom he continues to have a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship.  The judge accepted  that  he  had  family
    life with his two youngest children and at the date of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision his youngest child was  a  minor  and  the  other  an
    unmarried 19 year old.

18. All of the sponsor's children are now adults  but  I  accept  that  the
    situation has continued as it was before the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    where his adult children  continue  to  live  with  their  mother,  his
    estranged  wife,  with  regular  contact  with  the  sponsor.   I  have
    considered the relevant jurisprudence including  Kugathas  [2003]  EWCA
    Civ 31 and I am satisfied, given that the adult  children  continue  to
    live in their mother's family home, albeit financially supported by the
    sponsor and to some extent emotionally dependent on their father,  that
    family life exists.

19. However, there is no best interest consideration required  in  relation
    to adult children.   The  adult  children  of  the  sponsor's  previous
    relationship continue to live with  their  mother  and  as  noted  have
    contact with their father and I accept there is family life.  There  is
    no evidence before me to suggest that the financial support the sponsor
    gives his children would cease if he were required to go  to  Pakistan.
    There was evidence before me that the sponsor has had and continues  to
    have a number of restaurant businesses in the UK and  he  indicated  in
    oral evidence before me that he was  about  to  purchase  another  such
    business, having sold some of his previous businesses.

20. In finding as Judge Sethi did that it would not be reasonable to expect
    family life to continue in Pakistan Judge Sethi applied the wrong test.
     Although there is one family life and it may present  difficulties  to
    the sponsor in maintaining family life, such as  it  continues  to  be,
    given that all his children are adults and will increasingly lead their
    own independent lives, if the sponsor  returns  to  Pakistan  with  the
    appellant, I am not satisfied that it has been demonstrated  that  such
    is an insurmountable obstacle.  I have taken into consideration that it
    was the consistent evidence before me of all  the  witnesses  that  the
    sponsor sees his adult children once every week or once every ten  days
    and that he speaks to them on the telephone two to three times a  week.
    There was no evidence to suggest that the telephone contact  could  not
    continue and that his relationship with  his  children  could  continue
    'through visits and communication  means'.   In  so  finding,  although
    modern communication means is normally not a substitute for family life
    continuing in the same country, this must be considered in the  context
    of adult children who will be increasing in their  independence;  there
    was evidence before me that his youngest child is on a gap year and his
    second youngest child is in  her  second  year  at  university  and  as
    already noted the children continue to live with their mother.

21. In assessing whether there are very  significant  difficulties  in  the
    appellant and  the  sponsor  moving  to  Pakistan  I  have  taken  into
    consideration the  evidence  before  me.   This  includes  evidence  in
    relation to the sponsor's business.  I accept that the  sponsor  has  a
    viable  ongoing  business  in  the  UK  consisting  of  a   number   of
    restaurants.  I have also taken into consideration that the sponsor  is
    a British citizen and that he has lived in the UK since the age of  16.
    However I rely on the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in  Agyarko
    & Others R (on the application of) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440 and in the Supreme Court in Agyarko.  At
    paragraph 25 of the Court of Appeal decision, it was outlined the  mere
    fact that a sponsor is a British citizen, has lived all their  life  in
    the UK and has a job here and hence may find it difficult and might  be
    reluctant to relocate could not constitute insurmountable obstacles.

22. I have also taken into consideration the evidence of both the appellant
    and the sponsor  that  they  have  concerns  as  to  maintaining  their
    relationship abroad as the sponsor is originally  from  Bangladesh  and
    the appellant is from Pakistan and their families are not supportive of
    the relationship.  However, as Mr Tufan pointed out there  is  a  large
    Bengali population in Karachi.  Although  it  was  indicated  that  the
    appellant's  family  are  from  Lahore,  that  in  itself,  even   when
    considered  cumulatively  with  all  the  other  factors,   would   not
    constitute insurmountable obstacles in requiring the couple to relocate
    to Pakistan.  There was no independent evidence before  me  to  suggest
    that there would be such difficulties.  I have taken into consideration
    that the sponsor has demonstrated an ability to establish businesses in
    the UK and there was no adequate evidence before me to suggest that  he
    would not be able to deploy his entrepreneurial abilities in a  similar
    capacity in Pakistan.  Although I accept that the sponsor would need to
    obtain a visa, there was no evidence before me to suggest that he would
    be unable to obtain  one  or  that  this  process  would  amount,  when
    considered cumulatively, to insurmountable obstacles to family life.

23. In reaching this finding I  have  taken  into  consideration  that  the
    sponsor had a heart attack in 2016.  Such was not  disputed.   Although
    he indicated that he needed his wife with him,  there  was  no  medical
    evidence to support his need for her ongoing presence and I have  taken
    into consideration that he continues to run and  indeed  establish  new
    businesses.  Although I accept, despite the lack of  medical  evidence,
    that he  may  require  ongoing  medication  and  monitoring  I  am  not
    satisfied, and there was no evidence to  suggest,  that  he  could  not
    receive any care that he needs in Pakistan if the couple were  returned
    there.  Equally, I have also taken into consideration that the  sponsor
    is originally from Bangladesh and there was  no  adequate  evidence  to
    support the appellant's claim that she could  not  go  and  live  there
    because of the history between the two countries and that she had never
    been there.  Again, there was  no  adequate  evidence  before  me  that
    obtaining a visa would amount to insurmountable obstacles if the couple
    decided to relocate there.  I am not satisfied that it has  been  shown
    that there would be "very serious hardship" to family  life  continuing
    outside of the UK.

24. I also consider that there would be no insurmountable obstacles to  the
    appellant and the sponsor continuing family life in Pakistan whilst the
    appellant applies for entry clearance or  on  a  more  extended  basis.
    There was no cogent evidence that the sponsor's  businesses  could  not
    continue in his absence or that, as already  indicated,  he  could  not
    establish himself business or  employment-wise  outside  the  UK.   The
    appellant told me that her younger sister is still in Pakistan as  well
    as extended family.  Although she told me that her family were  unhappy
    about her relationship there was no  adequate  information  to  suggest
    that this would prevent the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  establishing
    themselves in Pakistan either on a temporary or a more permanent basis.



25. I accept that there was evidence that on the face  of  it  the  sponsor
    appears to meet the financial  threshold.   However,  although  Mr  Lee
    valiantly submitted that some of the  correct  evidence  (in  terms  of
    Appendix FM-SE) was before the Upper Tribunal, this appeared  piecemeal
    at best and he did not continue with those submissions when  I  pointed
    to the various issues which had  been  raised  in  the  refusal  letter
    relation to Appendix FM-SE.  It  cannot  be  said  therefore  that  the
    appellant has  demonstrated  that  she  does  meet  the  provisions  of
    Appendix FM

26. I am also of the view that there were no compelling reasons  before  me
    that could lead to a decision in the  appellant's  favour  outside  the
    provisions of Appendix FM.  I have nevertheless applied the five  stage
    approach recommended in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  The key question is one
    of proportionality and I have  considered  a  'balance-sheet'  approach
    (see Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60).

27.  I have taken into consideration that although the appellant now  meets
    the requirements in relation to her relationship with the sponsor  they
    have  not  demonstrated  that  they  meet  the  financial  requirements
    including in terms of Appendix FM-SE.  I have taken into  consideration
    what was said Paragraph 76 of MM (Lebanon) [2017]  UKSC  10,  that  the
    tribunal should attach considerable weight to  judgments  made  by  the
    Secretary  of  State  in  the  exercise  of  her   responsibility   for
    immigration policy. However:

    "not everything in  the  rules  need  be  treated  as  high  policy  or
    peculiarly within the province  of  the  Secretary  of  State,  nor  as
    necessarily entitled to the same weight. The tribunal  is  entitled  to
    see a difference in principle between the  underlying  public  interest
    considerations, as set by the Secretary of State with the  approval  of
    Parliament, and the working out of that  policy  through  the  detailed
    machinery of the rules and its application  to  individual  cases.  The
    former naturally include issues such as the seriousness  of  levels  of
    offending sufficient to require  deportation  in  the  public  interest
    (Hesham Ali, para 46). Similar  considerations  would  apply  to  rules
    reflecting the Secretary of State's  assessment  of  levels  of  income
    required to avoid a burden on public resources, informed as  it  is  by
    the specialist  expertise  of  the  Migration  Advisory  Committee.  By
    contrast rules as to the quality of evidence necessary to satisfy  that
    test in a particular case are, as the committee  acknowledged,  matters
    of practicality rather than principle; and as such matters on which the
    tribunal may more readily draw on its own experience and expertise."

28. I have taken into consideration that this  is  not  a  case  where  the
    appellant is an overstayer.  However I have taken  into  consideration,
    as  I  must,  the  provisions  of  Section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  I accept that  the  appellant  speaks
    English and that she is financially independent and therefore no public
    interest attaches to these limbs of the test although at best they  are
    neutral factors.  However I  remind  myself  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration controls in itself is in the public interest.   I
    am not satisfied, relying on my findings above in relation to  Appendix
    FM Ex.1, that requiring the appellant and her husband  to  relocate  to
    either Pakistan or Bangladesh would be a disproportionate  interference
    with that family life.

29. I have also considered the submissions of the parties  in  relation  to
    Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40.  It was Mr Lee's submission  that  any
    application for Entry Clearance  would  succeed.   I  have  taken  into
    consideration what was said in the Supreme Court in  Agyarko  including
    at paragraph 51 as follows:

         "Whether the applicant is in the UK unlawfully, or is  entitled  to
         remain in the UK only temporarily,  however,  the  significance  of
         this consideration depends  on  what  the  outcome  of  immigration
         control might otherwise be. For  example,  if  an  applicant  would
         otherwise be automatically deported as a foreign criminal, then the
         weight of the public interest in his or her removal will  generally
         be very considerable. If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if
         residing in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted
         leave to enter, at least if an application were made  from  outside
         the UK, then there might be  no  public  interest  in  his  or  her
         removal. The point is illustrated by the decision  in  Chikwamba  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department."

30. Although I have attached considerable  weight  to  the  fact  that  the
    appellant was in the UK lawfully and that the appellant appears to meet
    the financial threshold, I agree with Mr Tufan's submission that  there
    was no certainty that the appellant would be granted  entry  clearance.
    In doing so, I have considered  what  was  said  by  this  Tribunal  in
    Chikwamba: R (on the application of Chen) IJR [2015]  UKUT  189   (IAC)
    which  confirmed  that  there  may  be  cases  where   there   are   no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life (which I have found to  be  the
    case  in  this  appeal),  but  where  temporary   separation   may   be
    disproportionate.  However:

         "in all cases it will be for the individual  to  place  before  the
         Secretary of State evidence that  such  temporary  separation  will
         interfere disproportionately with protected rights. It will not  be
         enough to rely solely upon the case law concerning Chikwamba v SSHD
         [2008] UKHL 40".

31. In my findings the appellant has not demonstrated, taking into  account
    all the factors, that requiring her to make such an application in this
    case would be disproportionate.

Visa Advice
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on [ ] 1979.  She  appealed
    to the First-tier Tribunal against the respondent's decision  dated  12
    August 2015 to refuse her leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  on
    human rights grounds as  the  partner  of  a  British  citizen.   In  a
    decision promulgated on 17 February 2017, following  a  hearing  on  20
    January 2017, Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Sethi  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights
    grounds.

 2. The appellant appeals with permission on the following grounds:

      a) the First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in her  analysis  as
         to whether the appellant's and her partner's previous marriages had
         permanently broken down,  in  circumstances  where  the  judge  had
         accepted that the appellant and sponsor had  lived  together  in  a
         genuine and subsisting relationship since 6 September 2012 and that
         they intended to permanently live together in the UK;

      b) the judge wrongly applied the case of  R  (on  the  application  of
         Chen) v SSHD (Appendix FM -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
         proportionality)  IJR   [2015]   UKUT   00189,   when   considering
         proportionality given that the judge has accepted that  there  were
         insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing abroad and  that
         the appellant was lawfully in the UK and was entitled to  make  the
         application she did within the UK to switch categories.

Decision on Error of Law and Directions

 3. For the reasons set out below I am satisfied that the judge  materially
    erred in law, such that her conclusions fall to be set aside.   It  was
    not disputed by  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe  that  the  judge's  findings  in
    relation to the genuineness of the relationship between  the  appellant
    and her sponsor were adequate and could stand.   I  therefore  preserve
    the judge's findings up to and including paragraph [20] of the Decision
    and Reasons.

 4. The judge accepted, at [17], that the appellant and  her  partner  (LR)
    had given a truthful account  of  their  relationship  having  had  the
    benefit of oral evidence from the appellant and her partner as well  as
    oral evidence from the sponsor's daughter.  She accepted that they  had
    cohabited in a genuine and subsisting  relationship  akin  to  marriage
    since September 2012 and that it was their  intention  to  continue  to
    live together permanently in such a relationship, paragraph  [20].   As
    already noted there was no dispute as to those findings.

 5. However, the judge went on to find at [24]  that  notwithstanding  that
    she was satisfied that:

         "the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  have  been  in  a  genuine  and
         subsisting relationship as an unmarried couple since 2012 that  the
         requirements of E-LTRP 1.9 were not shown to have been satisfied at
         the date of the application."

 6. E-LTRP.1.9. requires as follows:

         "Any previous relationship of the applicant or their  partner  must
         have broken down permanently, unless it  is  a  relationship  which
         falls within paragraph 278(i) of these Rules."

 7. Both the appellant and the sponsor were previously married.  The  judge
    noted, at [23], that the appellant was married in Pakistan in 2000  and
    she stated at paragraph  9  of  her  witness  statement  that  she  got
    divorced about a year later, although the judge noted that there was no
    evidence submitted to show that she was not still legally married.  The
    judge noted that the appellant gave oral evidence at  the  appeal  that
    her previous relationship had ended in a  divorce,  however  the  judge
    went on to find that there was no evidence with the application to show
    that her previous relationship had permanently broken down.  The  judge
    went on to find in the same paragraph that:

         "Equally in relation to the sponsor it is not in  dispute  that  he
         married  in  1987  and  that  at  the  date  of   the   appellant's
         application, as at the date of hearing, he remains legally  married
         to [JR], a British Citizen living in the UK."

 8. Although the respondent's Rule 24 notice dated 24 September 2017 and Ms
    Willocks-Briscoe sought to maintain that the judge's findings were open
    to her, albeit that Ms Willocks-Briscoe did not  pursue  this  argument
    with any great force, I am  of  the  view  that  the  judge's  findings
    disclose a material misunderstanding of E-LTRP.1.9., in that the  judge
    conflates the requirement that any  previous  relationships  must  have
    broken down permanently, with  a  requirement  that  the  parties  must
    provide documentary evidence that the  relationship  has  been  legally
    dissolved.

 9.  The  respondent's  own  guidance,  at  page  22  of  the   Immigration
    Directorate Instruction Family  Migration:  Appendix  FM  Section  1.0a
    Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private  Life  10-Year  Routes
    August 2015 provides as follows:

         "Note: An applicant  whose  marriage  or  civil  partnership  to  a
         previous partner (or that of the applicant's partner) has not  been
         legally dissolved, may qualify under Appendix FM  as  an  unmarried
         partner or same sex partner, provided that they meet  the  criteria
         of paragraph GEN.1.2. ... and they provide evidence  that  the  new
         relationship is  genuine  and  subsisting  and  that  the  previous
         relationship has broken down permanently."

10. With respect to the  appellant's  previous  relationship,  the  judge's
    findings at [23] in my view disclose an error in that she  equates  the
    lack of evidence of the divorce  with  a  lack  of  evidence  that  the
    previous relationship had broken down.  The  judge  accepted  that  the
    appellant was living with the sponsor and there was no evidence  before
    the judge and no findings to suggest anything otherwise in relation  to
    any continuing relationship between  the  appellant  and  her  previous
    husband.  The fact that the judge specifically refers  to  no  evidence
    being submitted "to show  that  she  was  not  still  legally  married"
    highlights that error on the judge's part.

11. With respect to the relationship between the  appellant's  sponsor  and
    his first wife, the judge made a  finding  at  [23]  that  the  sponsor
    remains legally married to [JR] which, in effect, led the judge to find
    that the appellant could not meet E-LTRP.1.9. at [24]; in  addition  in
    the judge's findings in respect of Article 8, whilst I  note  that  the
    judge  made  no  further  comment  or  findings  in  relation  to   the
    appellant's previous relationship (which in my view further  underlines
    her mistake at [23] in requiring evidence of  a  formal  divorce),  the
    judge did make findings including at [39] and [40] as to the  sponsor's
    first marriage.

12. The judge considered the sponsor's  evidence that he and his  wife  are
    estranged and considered a witness statement from the sponsor's wife in
    which [JR]  stated:

         "Our relationship broke down permanently in 2012".

    However, the judge noted that [JR] was not present at the  hearing  and
    her evidence had not been tested and attached  limited  weight  to  the
    written evidence.  The judge bore in mind that the  sponsor's  daughter
    had given evidence, which the judge  accepted  as  credible,  that  the
    sponsor and the appellant cohabited as a couple.   However,  the  judge
    went on to find that although the  sponsor  and  appellant  cohabit  as
    unmarried partners, this was insufficient in itself to cause her to  be
    satisfied that the sponsor's marriage had in  fact  ended  permanently.
    The judge took into account paragraphs 17 and 18  of  [JR]'s  statement
    where it was said that:

         "17. [LR] still comes to our house maybe once or twice  a  week  to
             collect his mail and see the children.

         18.  He supports us financially and he has a key to the house."

13.  The judge found that there was no good reason  why  the  sponsor  would
    still have a key to his wife's home and/or be collecting personal  mail
    from this property five years on, in circumstances  where  it  is  said
    that his marriage has ended and  he  has  lived  permanently  with  the
    appellant since 2012.  The judge found this to be especially  so  where
    [JR] described, at paragraph 15 of her statement, that she had recently
    moved house.  The judge went on, at [40],  to  consider  the  sponsor's
    evidence that he and his wife were not divorced because  his  wife  had
    agreed to the relationship with the appellant on the basis that he  did
    not divorce her and the sponsor's daughter also gave evidence that  she
    "likes the idea of her parents being married"  and  that  she  and  her
    siblings would be upset if her father and mother divorced.   The  judge
    accepted that it was a matter of personal choice for  the  sponsor  and
    his family as to whether he and his wife divorced, but went on to  find
    that there was no evidence to demonstrate that there were any legal  or
    religious barriers that would prevent the sponsor  and  his  wife  from
    seeking the dissolution  of  their  marriage  and  that  equally  there
    appeared to be no legal or religious  barriers  to  their  choosing  to
    effect a legal separation.  The judge went on to find,  at  [41],  that
    the position in the present case was that the parties  had  elected  to
    form an additional or  alternative  family  unit  and,  at  [42],  that
    although the judge was satisfied that the appellant and sponsor  had  a
    genuine  subsisting  relationship  and  intended   to   live   together
    permanently, she was not satisfied without further that this meant  his
    relationship with his wife had ended permanently.

14.  The judge's effective requirement, at  [40],  for  a  document  showing
    either a legal dissolution or  a  legal  separation  of  the  sponsor's
    marriage infects her findings as summarised above, including  at  [39],
    as to whether the sponsor's first marriage had permanently broken down.
     Although Ms Willocks-Briscoe submitted that the judge was entitled  to
    consider that the relationship had not broken  down,  especially  since
    the sponsor's wife had moved house and the sponsor still had a key, and
    it was her submission that emotional dependency could be  inferred,  if
    that was the judge's  finding,  it  was  incumbent  on  her  make  such
    findings and give reasons for reaching those conclusions.  In light  of
    her unchallenged findings as to the  genuineness  of  the  sponsor  and
    appellant's relationship (including  at  [37]  that  it  would  not  be
    reasonable for  family  life  between  the  appellant  and  sponsor  to
    continue in Pakistan),  it  was  incumbent  on  the  judge  to  provide
    adequate reasons for nevertheless  finding  that  the  sponsor's  first
    relationship had not permanently broken down.

15. There were, for example, no findings as to  any  physical  relationship
    between the sponsor and his first wife.  There was also  no  discussion
    as to the definition of what a relationship that has permanently broken
    down means.  Its meaning is not in my view inconsistent with  continued
    contact between the parties, or indeed regular visits (and the  holding
    of a key) in circumstances where  the  parties  had  children  and  the
    sponsor  was  supporting  his  first  wife  financially  and  providing
    accommodation.  As Mr Lee put  it,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the
    Secretary of State or any Tribunal would accept  an  assertion  of  the
    existence of a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  in  circumstances
    where the applicant held a key and visited his alleged partner once  or
    twice a week to collect mail or visit children whilst  cohabiting  with
    another partner on a full-time basis.

16. As I have  already  indicated  there  is  no  need  to  show  a  formal
    dissolution of a previous marriage in order to qualify  under  EX-1  of
    Appendix FM and the judge in effect found that without  such  a  formal
    dissolution neither the appellant nor her sponsor could show  that  the
    previous  relationship  had   broken   down   permanently,   which   is
    inconsistent with the Rules and guidance.   The  judge  has  failed  to
    provide adequate reasoning in this context to support her finding  that
    the relationship between  the  sponsor  and  his  first  wife  had  not
    permanently broken down.  I take into account that there was no finding
    with regard to a physical relationship and no finding  with  regard  to
    any continued emotional dependency and I do  not  accept  Ms  Willocks-
    Briscoe's submission that such a finding of  emotional  dependency  was
    implicit.  I reiterate that in view of the judge's very clear  findings
    of the  strength  and  genuineness  of  the  relationship  between  the
    appellant and the sponsor it was essential that the  judge  make  clear
    findings as to why the first relationships had not  permanently  broken
    down.

17. In these circumstances there is a material error of law such  that  the
    judge's conclusions had to be set aside.


Re-making of the decision

18. I was initially disposed to remaking the decision at the hearing.   The
    appellant and the sponsor were present and available to give  evidence.
    However, the sponsor's daughter who gave evidence at the first hearing,
    [SR], was not available; I was told she was at university.

19. Although I indicated that I was minded to preserve the judge's findings
    up to and including paragraph [20], given that the Tribunal  will  have
    to reach further findings of fact, including specifically  with  regard
    to whether the previous relationships have broken down permanently  and
    whether there are insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  with  the
    sponsor continuing outside  the  UK,  I  shared  Ms  Willocks-Briscoe's
    concern as to the absence of the third witness.

Notice of Decision on Error of Law

The First-tier Tribunal's determination contains an error of law capable  of
affecting the outcome of the appeal and is set aside.  The judge's  findings
of fact up to and including [20] are to be preserved

The decision on the appeal will be remade by the Upper Tribunal.

                                 Directions


     A. The appellant is to file and serve a consolidated bundle of evidence
        so that it is received no later than 11 December 2017. The bundle is
        to separately tabulate: (i) the  evidence  relied  upon  before  the
        First-tier Tribunal; and, (ii) the additional evidence  that  it  is
        now sought to rely upon before the Upper Tribunal. The  bundle  must
        contain any evidence relied on to address both the issue of  whether
        the previous relationships have broken down and how  the  additional
        requirements of Appendix  FM,  EX.1  are  satisfied  or  how  it  is
        contended that the appellant can otherwise succeed (and I note  that
        the sponsor's youngest child is now  18).   The  Tribunal  would  be
        assisted by further evidence including oral evidence at the  hearing
        from  the  sponsor's  wife  and   it   is   anticipated   that   the
        aforementioned bundle will include updated witness  statements  from
        all witnesses to be called, to stand as their evidence-in-chief.


     B. The Secretary of State is to file and serve, by  no  later  than  18
        December 2017, any evidence relied upon that is not contained within
        the bundle she relied upon before the FtT.


   Any failure to comply with these directions  may  lead  the  Tribunal  to
   exercise its powers to decide the appeal without a further oral  hearing,
   or to conclude that the defaulting party  has  no  relevant  information,
   evidence or submissions to provide.

No anonymity direction is sought or is made.
