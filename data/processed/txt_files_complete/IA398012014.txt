                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. This is an appeal and challenge against a First-tier Tribunal decision,
    promulgated on 23rd  March  2015,  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
    against the Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  refuse  to  vary  the
    appellant's leave to remain.

 2. An application for permission to appeal was  refused  by  a  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge who stated that  the  appellant  had  not  supplied  any
    evidence to support his claim.  That application, however, was  renewed
    to the Upper Tribunal and granted by an Upper Tribunal Judge who stated
    that there was a  fax  on  file  from  the  representative  dated  12th
    February 2015 to change the appeal to an oral hearing and that fax  was
    on file but there was no evidence to show  the  Tribunal  took  further
    action to respond.  It was  arguable  that  it  was  incumbent  on  the
    Tribunal to allow the appellant a fair  opportunity  to  put  his  case
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

 3. I will set out the background  to  the  appeal.   The  appellant  is  a
    citizen of  Bangladesh  born  on  20th  August  1986  and  he  made  an
    application on 31st July 2014 for a Tier 4 General Student visa.   That
    application was refused on 18th September 2014  under  paragraph  245ZX
    specifically paragraph 245ZX(d).  The respondent also made  a  decision
    to remove the appellant by way of directions under Section  47  of  the
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2006.

 4. The Secretary of State stated that the appellant had not  been  awarded
    10 points for maintenance funds as the  closing  balance  of  his  bank
    statements submitted in support of his application was dated 18th  July
    2014 and he needed to show evidence of maintenance of 28 days from 21st
    June 2014 to 18th July.  The amount he was required to show was  �9,180
    but on 15th July 2014 he only could demonstrate that he had �7,500.14.

 5. His appeal was decided on the papers on 20th March 2015  by  First-tier
    Tribunal  Judge  Grimes  who  dismissed  the  appeal  both  under   the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.

 6. Judge Grimes  stated  at  paragraph  7  that  the  appellant  "has  not
    contended that his removal would  breach  the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights and there is nothing in the papers before me  to  indicate
    that he has established a private or family life in the UK such  as  to
    lead to a possible breach of Article 8 of the ECHR.

 7. I note the appeal notice was dated 6th October 2014 and did not enclose
    any reference to human rights.  The appeal  was  lodged  by  way  of  a
    covering letter from UK Immigration Consultants on 17th November 2014.

 8. An application for permission to appeal was  made  on  8th  April  2015
    claiming that after receiving new instructions from the  appellant  the
    representative sent correspondence to the  Tribunal  on  12th  February
    2015 stating that the appellant wanted the appeal to be decided by  way
    of an oral hearing, not on the papers, where he  would  have  a  better
    opportunity to provide evidence.  This was said to have  been  sent  by
    fax to the Tribunal on 12th February 2015 at 16.05.  Since the  request
    was submitted neither the appellant nor the representative received any
    reply from the Tribunal regarding the request and on 23rd March 2015  a
    determination was promulgated from the First-tier Tribunal  without  an
    oral hearing.

 9. It was submitted that the First-tier Tribunal Procedural Rules had  not
    been followed by the  Tribunal  and  the  appellant  did  not  have  an
    opportunity to have access to justice.

10. It was submitted that the Secretary of State did not consider paragraph
    245AA and the applicant had provided  all  the  requisite  evidence  to
    support his application except for part of a bank statement with regard
    to his maintenance funds.

11. At the hearing before me Miss Isherwood submitted  that  the  appellant
    could not comply with the Immigration Rules.

12. The appellant attended and confirmed that there was one matter in issue
    in the appeal and that was the assessment of his ability  to  meet  the
    financial requirements.  He submitted that had the Secretary  of  State
    considered his funds from 14th July backwards he would have  been  able
    to comply with the 28 day period of the relevant funds.  He had checked
    with his university and they had told him that his bank statements were
    in order.  He stated that he had submitted the Barclay  Bank  statement
    with his name and address on because  he  thought  that  was  the  more
    appropriate document to submit to the Secretary of  State  rather  than
    the mere printout which stopped at 14th July.

13. The appellant produced the bank statements to show what was before  the
    respondent and this comprised a statement of 20th  June  to  18th  July
    2014.   It  is  clear  from  the  refusal  letter  that  the  statement
    considered by the respondent is that which ends on 18th July 2014.   As
    at 15th July 2014 the appellant clearly held �7,514 in his account  and
    this remained until 18th July 2014.

14. Further to Appendix C with  reference  to  paragraph  245ZX  1A(a)  the
    appellant must have  the  funds  specified  in  the  relevant  part  of
    Appendix C as at the date of the application.  Further  to  Appendix  C
    1A(c) if the applicant is applying as a Tier 4  Migrant  the  applicant
    must have the funds referred to in (a) above for a consecutive  28  day
    period of time.

15. Further to 1A(h) the end date of the 28 day period would  be  taken  as
    the date of the closing balance on the most  recent  of  the  specified
    documents (where specified documents from two  or  more  accounts  were
    submitted, this will be the end date for the account that most  favours
    the applicant), and must be no earlier than 31 days before the date  of
    the application.

16. There was no dispute that the appellant was required to show the sum of
    �9,180 but in line with the Immigration Rules the date for the purposes
    of the 28 day period would run backwards from 18th July 2015 as this is
    the statement that the appellant supplied to the  respondent.   For  at
    least three days in this 28 day period the appellant was short of funds
    in the sum of �1,599.86.

17. I note that there was a request on file for the appellant  to  have  an
    oral hearing and therefore there is an error to  the  effect  that  the
    appellant should have been afforded an oral hearing bearing in mind the
    representations made by the appellant's solicitors.  At no point in his
    appeal nor in the letter of 12th February 2015 did the issue  of  human
    rights arise and from my analysis given above the appellant  could  not
    hope to succeed on the basis of the financial documents  placed  before
    the Secretary of State.   At the hearing, I listened to his explanation
    and although there was a procedural error by the First-tier Tribunal to
    proceed by way of deliberation on the papers alone, I find  that  there
    was no substantive merit in the appellant's  claim.  I  therefore  find
    there was an error of law in the decision through the failure to afford
    the appellant an oral  hearing  but  his  physical  attendance  at  the
    Tribunal could not assist his claim because it  could  not  remedy  the
    defects within the documentation which  were  critical.  There  was  no
    mileage in the argument that Paragraph 245AA could assist him.  It  was
    not the case that there was any documentation missing in a series  (and
    therefore the case can be distinguished from  Mandalia  v  SSHD  [2015]
    UKSC 59), nor that the documentation was in the wrong format or was not
    original.  There is purpose in the  rules  as  framed  to  ensure  that
    adequate financial arrangements are in place for study.   Unfortunately
    the appellant could not comply with those  requirements.   I  therefore
    remake the decision and dismiss the appeal.

No anonymity direction is made.
