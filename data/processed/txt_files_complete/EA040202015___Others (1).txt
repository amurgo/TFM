                                     and

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                            Decision and Reasons



 1. The Tribunal issued a direction on 15 December 2017 requesting that the
    parties provide written reasons within 7 days as to why an error of law
    should not be found and the appeal remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal
    following Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.

 2. No  response  was  received  from  either  party  within  7  days.  The
    respondent wrote opposing remittal on 29  December  2017  but  gave  no
    reason for the delay in respondent which, in the context  of  a  7  day
    time limit was significant. Time is not extended for  the  respondent's
    submissions of 29 December 2017.

 3. Even taking into account  the  submissions  made  in  the  respondent's
    letter of 29 December 2017, the Tribunal's view  is  that  the  law  at
    present is that set out in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ  1755  and  that
    this requires an error of law to be found, the decision of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal set aside and  the  appeal  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 4. The decision of Designated Judge McCarthy discloses  an  error  of  law
    such that it is set aside and remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be
    re-made de novo.

 5. The hearing listed for 31 January 2018 is vacated.
