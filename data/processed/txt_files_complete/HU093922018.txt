Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside by me and the
         appeal was adjourned for a continuation hearing reserved to me.  No
         findings made in the First-tier Tribunal were preserved.

      2. The appellant entered the UK illegally on 3 March 2016, accompanied
         by her son, LP, then aged four. On 11 December 2016, she gave birth
         to her daughter, LA. On 16 November 2016 she  made  an  application
         for leave on the basis of her family life with her partner, Mr [A],
         and her children. Mr [A] has indefinite  leave  to  remain,  having
         been recognised as a refugee from Kosovo.

      3. The error of law decision made clear that the appellant's  partner,
         the father of her children, has  indefinite  leave  to  remain.  It
         follows that LA is a British  citizen  by  birth  and  therefore  a
         'qualifying child' for the purposes of section 117B(6) of the  2002
         Act. There is no challenge to the fact the appellant has a  genuine
         and subsisting relationship with her  children.  The  narrow  issue
         left to resolve is whether it is reasonable to expect LA  to  leave
         the United Kingdom.

      4. No new evidence was filed by either party.

      5. The appellant bears the burden of establishing the factual matters
         on which she relies to the civil standard of a balance of
         probabilities.

      6. I heard brief oral evidence from the appellant and her partner. The
         appellant used an Albanian  interpreter.  The  partner  managed  in
         English.

      7. The appellant said she entered the United Kingdom in  order  to  be
         with her partner, Mr [A], and so that her son, LP,  could  be  with
         his father. If she had to return to Albania, she would  prefer  her
         daughter, LA, to stay in the United Kingdom with her father but she
         is still breast-feeding her. She confirmed that she lives with  her
         partner and their two children. She is in contact with her  parents
         and siblings in Albania but she has not been back to Albania  since
         she arrived here.

      8. The appellant's partner said he is the father of both children.  He
         came from Kosovo in 1998 and has lived in the United  Kingdom  ever
         since. He works part-time. If the appellant returned to Albania, he
         would not go with her.

      9. In her submissions, Ms Pal did not challenge the evidence that  the
         appellant lives with her partner and two children as a family  unit
         and has done so since she arrived in  2016  or  that  LA  is  still
         breast-feeding at the age of 2ï¿½. I find that the evidence  of  both
         the appellant and her partner to be consistent and honest.

     10. Ms Pal invited me to find that it would be  reasonable  for  LA  to
         leave the United Kingdom despite being a British citizen. She  said
         nothing more.

     11. Mr Collins relied on the respondent's  guidance  Family  Migration:
         Appendix FM Section 1.0b Family Life (as a Partner or  Parent)  and
         Private Life: 10-Year Routes, Version 4.0, published  on  11  April
         2019. He said the starting-point was that LA should not be expected
         to leave the United Kingdom. Applying KO (Nigeria)  v  SSHD  [2018]
         UKSC 53, [2018] 1 WLR 5273, the 'real world' context was that  LA's
         father was settled in the United Kingdom and not from  Albania.  Mr
         Collins took me to the facts of JG and the tribunal's concern about
         uprooting the children. It was also pertinent to the  'real  world'
         assessment that the appellant's partner did not  meet  the  minimum
         income threshold to be able to sponsor the appellant to return with
         entry clearance. The family separation would be lengthy.

     12. Having considered the submissions made, I have decided to allow the
         appeal because I find with is not reasonable to expect LA to  leave
         the United Kingdom.

     13. The respondent's guidance was amended in April  and  now  reads  in
         relevant part as follows:

             "Would it be reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?

             If the effect of refusal of the application would  be,  or  is
             likely to be, that the child would have to leave the  UK,  the
             decision maker must consider whether it would be reasonable to
             expect the child to leave the UK.

             Where there is a qualifying child

             A child is a qualifying child if they are a British child  who
             has an automatic right of  abode  in  the  UK,  to  live  here
             without any immigration restrictions  as  a  result  of  their
             citizenship, or a non-British citizen child, who has lived  in
             the UK for a  continuous  period  of  at  least  the  7  years
             immediately  preceding  the   date   of   application,   which
             recognises that over time children start to put down roots and
             to integrate into life in the UK. The starting point  is  that
             we would not normally expect a qualifying child to  leave  the
             UK. It is normally in a child's best interest  for  the  whole
             family to remain together, which means if  the  child  is  not
             expected to leave, then the parent or parents or primary carer
             of the child will also not be expected to leave the UK.

             In the caselaw of KO and Others 2018 UKSC53,  with  particular
             reference to the case of NS (Sri  Lanka),  the  Supreme  Court
             found that "reasonableness" is to be considered in  the  real-
             world  context  in  which  the  child  finds  themselves.  The
             parents' immigration status is a relevant  fact  to  establish
             that context. The determination sets out  that  if  a  child's
             parents are both expected  to  leave  the  UK,  the  child  is
             normally expected to leave with them, unless there is evidence
             that that it would not be reasonable.

             There may be some specific circumstances  where  it  would  be
             reasonable to either expect the qualifying child to leave  the
             UK with the parent(s) or primary carer or for the parent(s) or
             primary carer to leave the UK and for the child  to  stay.  In
             deciding such cases, the decision maker must consider the best
             interests of the child and the facts relating to the family as
             a whole. The decision maker should also consider any  specific
             issues raised by the family or by, or on behalf of  the  child
             (or other children in the family).

             It may be reasonable for a qualifying child to  leave  the  UK
             with the parent or primary carer where for example:

           . the parent or parents, or child, are a citizen of the  country
             and so able to enjoy the full rights of  being  a  citizen  in
             that country

           .  there  is  nothing  in  any  country  specific   information,
             including as contained in relevant country  information  which
             suggests that relocation would be unreasonable

             .    the parent or parents  or  child  have  existing  family,
             social, or cultural ties with the country  and  if  there  are
             wider  family  or  relationships  with  friends  or  community
             overseas that can provide support:

                  o    the decision maker must consider the extent to  which
                  the child is dependent on or requires support  from  wider
                  family members in the UK in important areas of his or  her
                  life and how a  transition  to  similar  support  overseas
                  would affect them

                  o    a person who has extended  family  or  a  network  of
                  friends in the country should be able to rely on them  for
                  support to help (re)integrate there

                  o    parent or parents or a child who  have  lived  in  or
                  visited the country before for periods of more than a  few
                  weeks. should be better able to adapt, or  the  parent  or
                  parents would be able to support the child in adapting, to
                  life in the country

                  o    the decision maker  must  consider  any  evidence  of
                  exposure to,  and  the  level  of  understanding  of,  the
                  cultural norms of the country

                  o    for example, a period of time spent living amongst  a
                  diaspora from the country may give a child an awareness of
                  the culture of the country

                  o    the parents or child can speak, read and write  in  a
                  language of that country, or are likely  to  achieve  this
                  within a reasonable time period

                  o    fluency is not required - an ability  to  communicate
                  competently with sympathetic interlocutors would  normally
                  suffice

             .    removal would not give rise to a significant risk to  the
             child's health

           . there are no other specific factors raised by or on behalf  of
             the child

             ..."

     14. This guidance, as Ms Pal recognised, places the respondent in some
         difficulties in resisting this appeal. It says that the starting-
         point is that qualifying children are not normally expected to
         leave the United Kingdom and that it is in a child's best interests
         for all the family to remain living together. It is plain to me
         that it is in LA's best interests to remain living in the United
         Kingdom, where she was born, so that she can continue to live in a
         household with both parents and her older brother, who is now aged
         seven.

     15. The prospect of the appellant's partner relocating to Albania was
         not explored. He said he would not go to Albania permanently and he
         was not challenged about this. It is clear from the circumstances
         of LP's birth that he has visited Albania. However, he is not a
         national of that country and he has resided in the United Kingdom
         since 1998.

     16. There is public interest in maintaining immigration controls and
         the appellant is an illegal entrant. However, her conduct must not
         be taken into account when assessing either the best interests of
         the child or the reasonableness of expecting the child to leave.
         The real-world context is that LA's father is not from Albania to
         where the appellant would have to return with LA. There would be no
         immediate prospect of the family being reunited given the fact the
         financial requirements of Appendix FM cannot be met. The
         circumstances show that uprooting LA to separate her from her
         father would be unreasonable and, therefore, the decision is
         disproportionate.

     17. The appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds.

APPENDIX: SET ASIDE DECISION

      1. The  appellant  appeals  with  the  permission  of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal against a decision of Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
         Stedman, promulgated on 28  January  2019,  dismissing  her  appeal
         against a decision  of  the  respondent,  made  on  6  April  2018,
         refusing her application for leave to  remain  on  the  grounds  of
         private and family life. The appellant entered the UK illegally  on
         3 March 2016, accompanied by her son, LP, then  aged  four.  On  11
         December 2016, she gave birth to her daughter, LA. On  16  November
         2016 she made an application for leave on the basis of  her  family
         life with her partner,  Mr  [A],  and  her  children.  Mr  [A]  has
         indefinite leave to remain, having been  recognised  as  a  refugee
         from Kosovo.

      2. The appellant's application was refused for the following reasons:

           . the application  was  refused  by  reference  to  the  10-year
             partner route because the appellant was not married to Mr  [A]
             and had not lived with him in a relationship akin to  marriage
             for at least two years  prior  to  the  date  of  application.
             Therefore, she did not fall within the definition of 'partner'
             found in paragraph GEN.1.2 of Appendix FM Immigration Rules;

           . the application failed  on  suitability  grounds  because  the
             appellant owed ï¿½5,827.50 to the NHS for treatment received  in
             December 2016;

           . the application  could  not  be  considered  by  reference  to
             paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM of the rules;

           . there were no very significant obstacles  to  the  appellant's
             reintegration in Albania;

           . LP did not meet the eligibility requirements of the rules  for
             leave  to  remain  under  Appendix  FM  because  his  mother's
             application had been refused and his father did not have leave
             granted under Appendix FM;

           . there were no exceptional circumstances to warrant a grant  of
             leave outside the Immigration Rules because there  was  little
             documentary evidence to demonstrate  the  appellant  shared  a
             family life with her claimed partner;

           . the decision was in accordance with the best interests of  the
             children.

      3. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. She argued  that
         removing her would amount to a very serious  breach  of  article  8
         because of her genuine relationship with her  settled  partner  and
         her genuine relationship with her British child.

      4. Judge Stedman heard the appeal at Hatton Cross on 15 January  2019.
         He noted that the appellant had not made a  protection  claim  even
         though she had mentioned in  her  application  that  she  had  been
         disowned by her family  and  she  feared  for  the  safety  of  her
         children. In any event,  he  found  the  appellant's  evidence  was
         inconsistent with any such fear because she  said  her  family  had
         helped finance her travel arrangements.  The  appellant  also  said
         that the reason she could  not  return  to  Albania  was  that  the
         economic circumstances there are bad.

      5. The judge's findings on the issues under appeal begin at  paragraph
         23 of his decision. He noted that LA was born in the UK and "cannot
         be removed". He found the appellant entered the UK illegally in the
         knowledge that she was unable to apply to join her partner  through
         the normal channels. Mr [A] gave evidence that he was on  benefits.
         The judge found that  the  appellant's  actions  were  designed  to
         circumvent immigration control and that her family and private life
         had been formed at a time that her status was precarious. The judge
         noted the unimpressive nature of the  quality  of  the  appellant's
         family life. He found this was not a close  family  unit  and  that
         there were no particularly close or strong bonds or emotional  ties
         between them. Mr [A] gave evidence that he did not believe that  LP
         was his son until he had been shown  DNA  evidence  which,  to  the
         judge, demonstrated a complete lack of trust between  him  and  the
         appellant. Whatever relationship  they  had,  separation  for  many
         years did not appear to have  been  a  matter  of  consequence  for
         either of them. The judge characterised  Mr  [A]'s  evidence  under
         cross-examination as "almost nonchalant about his family life"  and
         noted  he  was  "quite  reluctant  to  disturb   his   own   life's
         equilibrium".

      6. Beginning at paragraph 28, the judge considered the best  interests
         of the children which, he recognised, were a primary consideration.
         He recognised that  it  is  generally  in  the  best  interests  of
         siblings not to be separated but to remain  together.  He  reasoned
         that, in this case, that decision is a matter for  the  parents  to
         decide because LA would not be subject to removal.

      7. The judge went on to conclude that the rules were not  met  and  he
         did not see any compelling or compassionate circumstances to render
         the refusal of leave to remain a breach of article 8. He considered
         the public interest  outweighed  the  competing  interests  of  the
         appellant and her children. He found the respondent's decision  was
         an entirely proportionate response to the  specific  facts  of  the
         case. He dismissed the appeal.

      8. The grounds seeking permission to appeal argued that the judge  had
         indulged  in  conjecture  and  speculation  rather  than   rational
         analysis of the evidence. The judge had  not  expressly  noted  the
         salient fact that LA is a  British  citizen.  As  such,  she  is  a
         'qualifying child' for the purposes of Part VA of the  Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The judge's "wholesale failure" to
         consider whether it would be reasonable for a British citizen child
         to leave the UK is a material error of law.

      9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal
         O'Brien considered it was arguable the judge had failed to consider
         reasonableness under section 117B(6), as he  was  mandated  to  do.
         Whilst the judge's conclusions might well have been  the  same,  it
         was at least arguable that his failure was material.

     10. The respondent has not filed a rule 24 response.

     11. Mr Collins's submissions followed his written grounds. In reply, Ms
         Everett accepted the force of Mr Collins's points. She accepted the
         judge had, at  most,  only  considered  the  reasonableness  of  LP
         leaving the UK.

     12. I agree with the representatives that the error in this decision is
         sufficient to require it to be set aside. I suspect the  judge  was
         fully aware that LA was a British citizen.  He  clearly  recognised
         that her father, Mr [A], had indefinite leave to remain under which
         circumstances, LA would have been born British pursuant to  section
         1(1)(b)  of  the  British  Nationality  Act   1981.   The   judge's
         recognition of this point can be read into his observation that  LA
         could not be removed.

     13. However, it follows that Mr Collins is right to argue that  section
         117A(2) of the 2002 Act mandated the judge to have  regard  to  the
         considerations listed in section  117B.  Section  117B(6)  provides
         that,

             "(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation,
             the public interest does not require the person's removal
             where-

                  (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
                  relationship with a qualifying child, and

                  (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child to
                  leave the United Kingdom."

     14. In R (MA (Pakistan))  v  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
         Chamber) and Another [2016] EWCA Civ 705, [2016] 1 WLR  5093  Elias
         LJ identified the questions posed by the section as being:

           . Is the applicant liable to deportation?

           . Does the applicant have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with the child?

           . Is the child a qualifying child?

           . Is it unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?

     15. If the answer to the first question is no, and the  answer  to  the
         other three questions is yes, then removing the applicant would  be
         a breach of article 8. The answer to the first three  questions  in
         this  case  is  uncontroversial.  There  is  no  challenge  to  the
         genuineness or subsisting nature of the parental relationship.  The
         error by the judge was his failure to direct himself  in  terms  of
         the final question.

     16. The correct approach to this  question  has  been  the  subject  of
         considerable  discussion  in  both  the  higher  courts  and   this
         Tribunal. Most recently, it was considered by the Court  of  Appeal
         in SSHD v AB (Jamaica) & Anor [2019] EWCA Civ 661. The Court  held,
         following KO (Nigeria) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
         [2018] UKSC 53, [2018] 1 WLR 5273, that the focus in paragraph  (b)
         is solely on the child and there is no  justification  for  reading
         the concept of reasonableness so as to include a  consideration  of
         the conduct and immigration history of the parents as  part  of  an
         overall analysis of the public  interest.  The  judge  acknowledged
         this in paragraph 22 of his decision.

     17. However, the Court of Appeal also confirmed the  approach  of  this
         Tribunal  in  SR  (Subsisting  Parental  Relationship  -  s117B(6))
         Pakistan [2018] UKUT 00334 (IAC) and  the  subsequent  Presidential
         decision in JG (s 117B(6): "reasonable to leave"  UK)  [2019]  UKUT
         00072 (IAC) that the section asks a single question  and  the  fact
         the child would not in reality be expected to leave the UK did  not
         mean that the question of whether it was reasonable to  expect  the
         child to leave did not arise. As Singh LJ  explained  at  paragraph
         75,

             "It is clear, in my view, that the question which the  statute
             requires  to  be  addressed  is  a  single  question:  is   it
             reasonable to expect the child to leave the UK?  It  does  not
             consist of two questions, as suggested  by  the  Secretary  of
             State. If the  answer  to  the  single  question  is  obvious,
             because it is  common  ground  that  the  child  will  not  be
             expected to leave the UK, that does not mean that the question
             does not have to be asked; it merely means that the answer  to
             the question is: No."

     18. The judge in this case did not have the benefit of the decisions in
         PG and AB (Jamaica). However, it is clear that he did not pose  the
         key question so as to  show  he  had  assessed  the  reasonableness
         question in relation to the British child. That can  be  seen  from
         the reference to LA in paragraph 35 of the decision, where he says,
         "The appellant's daughter will no doubt, with the agreement of  her
         father, return to Albania with the mother as her primary carer".

     19. I consider that the decision must be re-made in the Upper Tribunal.
         Evidence will have to be called  and  findings  made  in  order  to
         decide whether it is reasonable to  expect  the  British  child  to
         leave the UK.

     20. The appeal is therefore allowed to the extent the decision  of  the
         First-tier Tribunal is set aside. The appeal  is  adjourned  for  a
         continuance hearing reserved to me. The parties may file and  serve
         additional evidence which is focused on the single  issue  left  to
         determine.
