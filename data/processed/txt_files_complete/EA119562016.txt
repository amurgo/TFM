For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on  25  February  1959.   He
    appeals against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  M  A  Khan
    dismissing his appeal against  the  refusal  of  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a permanent right of residence  under  the  Immigration
    (EEA) Regulations 2006.

 2. The Appellant came to the UK in 2003.  His first child was born in 2006
    and his second child was born in 2007. The mother of  his  children  is
    Margaret Mary Abu [MMA]. On 25 November 2009, the Appellant married  an
    EEA national, Sarlota Mikusova. On 7  April  2010,  he  was  granted  a
    residence card for one  year.  On  1  April  2011,  he  was  granted  a
    residence card for five years. On 19 December 2011 his third child  was
    born. The mother is MMA. On 23 March 2016, the Appellant applied for  a
    permanent residence card. This was refused on 27 September 2016.

3.   In the refusal letter the Respondent stated:

         "In your application you state that your EEA national  Sponsor  was
         employed for a  continuous  period  of  five  years  and  you  have
         provided two payslips from 31st December 2015 and 31st January 2016
         as well as an  HMRC  letter  outlining  your  Sponsor's  employment
         history from April 2011 until April 2015. On this  HMRC  letter  it
         shows that in the tax year April 2013 to April 2014 there is a  gap
         in your Sponsor's employment between June 2013 and February 2014 as
         the employment information shows she worked for FSH Recruitment but
         only earned �30 for this period, meaning she was not working  full-
         time as �30 would reflect at most a day's income and  as  such  not
         exercising treaty rights. Based off  (sic)  the  evidence  provided
         your Sponsor would therefore fail to meet Regulation  15(1)(b)  for
         this period and so would not be exercising treaty rights for a full
         five years."

         ...

         "You have provided this Department with  a  photocopy  of  your  UK
         marriage certificate dated 25 February 2009  showing  your  marital
         status as 'single' but have also  provided  two  photocopied  birth
         certificates  for  REA  and  HUA  listing  you  as  their   father.
         Additionally,  on  these  birth  certificates   you   have   solely
         registered the birth which can only be done when you are married to
         the mother of the children (who is  listed  as  Margaret  Mary  Abu
         [MMA]). As such you have been married  prior  to  marrying  Sarlota
         Mikusova and have not provided any evidence of  your  divorce  from
         MMA.

         You have also provided photocopies of  the  residence  permits  for
         your children, after checking  these  records  it  shows  that  the
         children's and their mother's addresses are the same address as the
         company you registered in 2014. Also, when checking  these  records
         this Department were (sic) able to see that you and MMA had another
         child SNA born 19 December 2011  after  your  marriage  to  Sarlota
         Mikusova. As such this evidence provided shows that you are  living
         in London with three children and MMA, and  your  spouse  lives  in
         Middlesbrough with no evidence provided to show the two of you have
         ever  lived  together.   Based  on  the  above  information,   this
         Department would refuse the application even if you  were  able  to
         prove you were free to marry.

         From the evidence  you  have  provided  this  Department  does  not
         recognise your marriage to Sarlota Mikusova as  no  proof  of  your
         divorce has been seen and so for this reason your application fails
         to meet 7(1)(a) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006  as  this
         Department does not recognise you as the family member  of  an  EEA
         national."

4.   The Appellant and his EEA Sponsor did not  attend  the  hearing  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge M A Khan. The judge concluded at  [26]  that,
    on the evidence before him, the  Appellant  was  married  to  MMA,  the
    children's mother and, at [27], he was living in London  with  her  and
    his children throughout his marriage to his EEA Sponsor, who  lived  in
    Middlesbrough. The judge found at [28] that it was for the Appellant to
    establish his case, on the balance of probabilities, that  he  and  his
    EEA Sponsor were living together continuously  for  a  period  of  five
    years in accordance with the EEA Regulations and the  EEA  Sponsor  was
    exercising Treaty rights. He concluded at [29] that the Appellant could
    not meet the requirements of Regulation 7(1)(a)  and  15(1)(b)  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal  Judge  Gill  on  29
    August 2019 for the following reasons:-

         "It is arguable that Judge of the First-tier Tribunal M A Khan  may
         have erred in law as follows:

         1.   Paragraph 1 of the grounds contends that there was no evidence
             before the judge that the married couple's option  was  chosen
             as opposed to the unmarried partner's option.

             At paragraph 26 of his decision  the  judge  referred  to  the
             registration of the birth of the appellant's third child (SNA,
             date of birth  19  December  2011)  and  that  the  birth  was
             registered using the  married  couple's  option  and  not  the
             unmarried partner's option. The decision letter refers to this
             issue but in connection with the birth certificates of REA and
             HUA (at E1 and E2 of the respondent's bundle). The issue taken
             in the decision letter in connection  with  SNA  is  that  the
             appellant had this child by another woman after he was married
             to his EEA-sponsor who was living elsewhere.  Accordingly,  on
             the limited material before me it appears that the  judge  may
             have mixed up the issues taken in the decision letter.  It  is
             difficult to see what the judge meant when he referred to  the
             married couple's option and the unmarried partner's option  as
             the birth certificates do not appear to  have  clear  couple's
             option or unmarried partner's option to  select.  There  is  a
             four page document produced from  https://www.gov.uk/register-
             birth/who-can-register-a-birth which did not help me to assess
             whether there was evidence before the  judge  to  support  his
             finding at paragraph 26.

             In these circumstances I was unable to see what  evidence  was
             before the judge to support his assessment  at  paragraph  26.
             Paragraph 1 of the grounds is therefore at least arguable.

         2.   If the judge did err as described above then  it  is  arguable
             that this was material for the following reasons:

             i)   the judge's reasoning and findings at paragraphs  27  and
                  28 of his decision arguably show that he erred in thinking
                  that it was necessary for the appellant to  show  that  he
                  had been living with his EEA-sponsor  continuously  for  a
                  period of five years in order to succeed in  this  appeal.
                  The judge appears to have  required  cohabitation  between
                  the Appellant and his EEA Sponsor, contrary to PM  (EEA  -
                  spouse - "residing with") Turkey [2011] UKUT 89 (IAC); and

             ii)  it appears that the judge had  evidence  of  the  Sponsor
                  exercising Treaty rights for the tax years from April 2011
                  to April 2015 (F1-F4 of the respondent's bundle)."



Submissions

6.   Mr Airhuoyo-Obazee relied on his skeleton argument and  submitted  that
    there was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that the Appellant
    was married to his ex-partner, MMA, with whom he  had  three  children.
    The judge erred in fact in  concluding  that  the  Appellant  had  been
    married previously. Further, the case law did not require the Appellant
    to live with his EEA Sponsor. Mr Airhuoyo-Obazee  accepted  that  there
    was no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that the  Appellant  had
    lived with his EEA Sponsor in London before she moved to Middlesbrough.
    However, at the time of this application the Appellant  was  living  at
    Webb House. MMA and his children were living at  a  different  address,
    although it was accepted that the Appellant had registered his business
    at that address and not the address where he was living. The  Appellant
    was not living with MMA.

7.   In relation to the gap in  employment  the  EEA  Sponsor  had  received
    jobseeker's allowance from November 2012 to June  2013.  It  was  clear
    that her earnings during 2013 to 2014 were meaningful and that she  had
    been actively seeking employment.  The five month gap relied on by  the
    Respondent was not sufficient to show that  the  EEA  Sponsor  was  not
    exercising Treaty  rights  for  the  full  five  years.  The  financial
    information and the documents from HMRC were sufficient  to  show  that
    she was economically active during the five year period  and  therefore
    exercising Treaty rights.

8.    Mr  Bramble  submitted  that  the  refusal  letter  referred  to   the
    Appellant's first two children and that there was an error by the judge
    in dealing with the  third  child.   However,  that  was  not  material
    because the document which was before the  judge  from  the  government
    website relating to the registration of births showed that, in relation
    to married parents, either parent can register the birth on their  own.
    They can include both parents' details if they were  married  when  the
    baby was born or conceived.   In  relation  to  unmarried  parents  the
    details of both parents can be included on the birth certificate if one
    of the following happens: they sign the birth  register  together;  one
    parent completes a statutory declaration  of  parentage  form  and  the
    other takes the signed form to register the birth; or one  parent  goes
    to register the birth with a document from the court giving the  father
    parental responsibility. Mr Bramble submitted that since the  Appellant
    himself had signed the register this was sufficient for  the  judge  to
    conclude that the Appellant was married to MMA. There was  no  evidence
    of a divorce and therefore the Appellant was not able to show  that  he
    was lawfully married to his EEA Sponsor.

9.   Mr Bramble accepted that the judge erred in finding that the  Appellant
    had to show he had lived with his EEA  Sponsor  continuously  for  five
    years, but again this was not material because there was no evidence of
    a divorce and therefore the marriage could not be said to be valid.

10.  Mr Bramble submitted that the Appellant had  not  shown  that  the  EEA
    Sponsor was exercising Treaty rights for five  years.  Her  jobseeker's
    allowance ended in June 2013 and there was no other  evidence  to  show
    that she was a jobseeker thereafter. There  was  insufficient  evidence
    that the EEA Sponsor was exercising Treaty rights between June 2013 and
    February 2014. During those five months she was only paid �30 and  this
    could not be considered to be genuine  and  effective  employment.  The
    judge failed to make a finding on this issue, but it was  not  material
    because there was insufficient evidence to show that  the  EEA  Sponsor
    was exercising Treaty rights for the relevant period.

11.  In response,  Mr  Airhuoyo-Obazee  submitted  that  the  EEA  Sponsor's
    earnings were sufficient to show that she was in genuine and  effective
    employment throughout the five year period.  Further, the Appellant was
    granted a residence card in 2011 and at that time the Home  Office  had
    full knowledge of the Appellant's two children. It was  unfair  to  say
    that the marriage was invalid five years later.  The  EEA  Sponsor  had
    been employed throughout the five year period whilst the Appellant  had
    a residence card and the marriage had lasted seven years.



Conclusions and Reasons

12.  The Appellant and his EEA Sponsor did not  attend  the  hearing  before
    the First-tier Tribunal. The judge was required to decide the appeal on
    the  papers  with  the  benefit  of  submissions  by  the   Appellant's
    representative. The submissions made were that it was not necessary for
    the Appellant and his EEA  Sponsor  to  live  together.  The  Appellant
    rented a room and lived in London because of his employment whilst  his
    EEA Sponsor lived in Middlesbrough. The Appellant was never married  to
    the mother of his three children. The Respondent had not  provided  any
    evidence about this. The Appellant and the mother of his children would
    not necessarily have to be married to register the birth of their third
    child. The Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law.

13.   Mr  Airhuoyo-Obazee  submitted  that  the  judge's  finding  that  the
    Appellant was married to MMA was not open to him on the evidence before
    him because the birth  certificates  and  accompanying  documents  were
    insufficient to enable  the  judge  to  rationally  conclude  that  the
    Appellant was married. Secondly, the documents were sufficient to  show
    that the EEA Sponsor was exercising Treaty rights throughout  the  five
    year period. It was irrational for the judge to conclude that  the  gap
    relied  on  by  the  Respondent  meant  that  her  employment  was  not
    sufficient given her level of income during the relevant tax years.

14.  The judge made the following findings of fact: The Appellant had  three
    children with MMA and they were living at an address in London where he
    registered his company in 2014. MMA gave birth to his third child, SNA,
    on 19 December 2011, after his  marriage  to  his  EEA  Sponsor  on  25
    February 2009. The judge considered the information from the government
    website and concluded the Appellant was married to MMA because  it  was
    only possible to register the birth of his children, on his own, if  he
    was married. I am of the view that this finding was reasonably open  to
    the judge on the evidence before him for the following reasons.

15.  The Appellant and his EEA Sponsor did  not  give  evidence  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal. The bundle which was before the judge stated  that
    the Appellant was in a love relationship with MMA and  they  had  three
    children but had never married. The Appellant met his  EEA  Sponsor  in
    2008 while he was separated from MMA and he married his EEA Sponsor  in
    2009.  He continued to support his children. The  Appellant  registered
    the birth of  his  two  children  born  in  2006  and  2007.  He  lived
    separately from his EEA Sponsor because of his employment with  Network
    Rail and there was no possibility of a job in Middlesbrough. There  was
    no evidence before the judge to show that the Appellant had ever  lived
    with his EEA Sponsor.

16.  The evidence before the judge  showed  that  the  Appellant  was  in  a
    relationship with MMA and he had three  children  with  her,  two  born
    before his marriage to his EEA Sponsor and one born  afterwards.  There
    was evidence that it was only possible for one parent to sign the birth
    certificate if the parents were married. The birth certificates of  REA
    and HUA showed the father as 'Godfrey ABU' and the mother as  'Margaret
    Mary ABU' and referred to her maiden name  as  'OMORAGBON'.  The  birth
    certificates are signed by the Appellant alone.

17.   The  information  from  the  government  website   relating   to   the
    registration of births stated as follows:

         "Married parents

         Either parent can register the birth on their own. They can include
         both parents' details if they were married when the baby  was  born
         or conceived.

         Unmarried parents

         The  details  of  both  parents  can  be  included  on  the   birth
         certificate if one of the following happens:

                . they sign the birth register together

                . one parent completes a statutory declaration of  parentage
                  and the other takes the signed form to register the birth

                . one parent goes to register the birth with a document from
                  the court (e.g. a court order) giving the father  parental
                  responsibility"

18.  There was no statutory declaration or court order before the judge  and
    the birth certificate was signed by the Appellant not MMA. On the basis
    of the evidence before the judge his conclusion that the Appellant  was
    married to MMA was open to him. The judge was entitled to  prefer  this
    evidence to  the  unsupported  assertion  in  the  Appellant's  witness
    statement that he was only in a love relationship with MMA and they had
    never  married.  Since  there  was  no  evidence  of  a  divorce,   the
    Appellant's marriage to his EEA Sponsor was not  valid.  Any  error  in
    finding that the Appellant had failed to show he had been  living  with
    his EEA Sponsor was not material.

19.  In any event, the appeal could not succeed because  the  Appellant  had
    failed to show that his EEA Sponsor had been exercising  Treaty  rights
    continuously for five years.  On the evidence before the  judge,  there
    was a gap in the EEA Sponsor's employment from June  2013  to  February
    2014. During this time the Appellant received �30 from FSH Recruitment.
     There was insufficient evidence to show that  she  was  genuinely  and
    effectively  employed  during  this  period.   There  was  insufficient
    evidence to show that she  was  a  jobseeker  because  her  jobseeker's
    allowance ended in June 2013.

20.  On the evidence before the judge, the  Appellant  had  failed  to  show
    that he was validly married to his EEA Sponsor or that his EEA  Sponsor
    was a qualified person exercising  Treaty  rights  for  the  five  year
    period. The was no material error of law in the judge's conclusion that
    the Appellant could not satisfy Regulation 7 and Regulation 15  of  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  I dismiss the Appellant's appeal.
