For the Appellant:           -
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Sri Lanka born on the  10th  June  1959.
    He appeals with permission the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    (Judge E.M.M  Smith)  to  dismiss  his  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ('the Regulations').


 2. The matter in issue before the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  whether  the
    Appellant qualified for a further residence card as the  family  member
    of his Danish wife.  The Secretary of  State,  in  his  refusal  letter
    dated 5th January 2018 had decided not,  for  two  reasons.  First  the
    application had not been supported by documentary evidence establishing
    a direct family relationship. Second,  the  application  had  not  been
    supported by evidence  demonstrating  that  the  Appellant's  wife  was
    exercising treaty rights.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal determined the first matter in the  Appellant's
    favour. It accepted that he is married to his wife, and that they  have
    five children together. They had all lived together in Denmark  for  27
    years before moving to  the  United  Kingdom  in  2005.   There  is  no
    challenge to that part of the Tribunal's decision and that  finding  of
    fact is to stand.

 4. As to the second issue the Tribunal was presented  with  the  following
    evidence:

           a) The application form which states that the  Appellant's  wife
              is employed by 'Royal Chicken & Pizza' in Leicester;
           b) A reference from a Mr Shafeek, purportedly the proprietor  of
              Royal Chicken & Pizza, dated 25th August  2017  stating  that
              the Appellant's wife is employed there;
           c) A number of payslips issued by 'Roy Chicken & Pizza' in 2017;
           d) The Appellant's oral evidence  that  his  wife  was  employed
              there, and that in fact the family had  paid  �21,500  to  Mr
              Shafeek in order to take over the business but this  had  not
              been a success and their interest had ceased in January 2018;
           e) Further oral evidence that  his  wife  had  other  employment
              which had not been mentioned in the application form;
           f) A print out from Companies House in respect of 'Roy Chicken &
              Pizza Ltd'.

 5. Against all of this was the Respondent's refusal letter in which it  is
    said that the caseworker was unable to verify this  claimed  employment
    since the telephone number was out of order, no record could  be  found
    for the company at Companies House and the take-away  delivery  website
    Just Eat no longer carried a listing for it.

 6. The Tribunal concluded that the Appellant's evidence  relating  to  his
    wife's economic activity was a muddle. Neither he nor his wife had been
    able to satisfactorily answer questions put to them;  no  accounts  had
    been submitted in respect of the purported takeover of the company; the
    Companies House registration was in a  different  name  from  that  the
    company was apparently using day to day.   At paragraph 24 the Tribunal
    notes that the hearing was "further complicated by the  sponsor's  lack
    of understanding of the questions asked of her[r]  either  because  she
    simply did not know the answers or did not understand  the  questions".
    Finding the burden of proof  had  not  been  discharged,  the  Tribunal
    dismissed the appeal.

 7. The Appellant now has  permission  to  appeal  against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision on the grounds that he was prejudiced by the lack  of
    court interpreter. He further asserts that his then representatives had
    failed to properly advise/ prepare the evidence required.

 8. As I explained to the Appellant in  open  court,  I  am  only  able  to
    interfere  with  a  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  if  it  is
    established that the Tribunal erred in  law  to  the  extent  that  the
    decision should be set aside.  As such any failings by the  Appellant's
    previous representatives are not something I can take into  account  in
    evaluating  the  fairness  and  legality  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision.

 9. The issue of the interpreter is another  matter.  The  Tribunal  itself
    expressed  some  doubts  about  whether  the  witnesses  were  able  to
    understand the questions being put to them, and I therefore agree  that
    in fairness the Tribunal ought to  have  either  enquired  whether  the
    witnesses  were  able  to  understand,  or  whether  they  wished   the
    proceedings to be halted so that  an  interpreter  could  be  summoned.
    That remains the case regardless of the fact that  an  interpreter  was
    not requested by the former representatives.

10. That does not however mean that the First-tier Tribunal decision should
    be set aside.   As Mr Melvin points out in his 'Rule 24 response',  the
    Appellant failed to discharge the burden of proof because of a lack  of
    documentary evidence. The Tribunal  expressly  declined  to  adopt  the
    HOPO's position that the witnesses were being untruthful [at  �25].  It
    simply did not have before it sufficient documentary  evidence  of  the
    sponsor's employment to be satisfied that  she  was  exercising  treaty
    rights in the United Kingdom, and for that reason the appeal fell to be
    dismissed. The evidence that there was was  relatively  old,  piecemeal
    and inconsistent on its face vis-a vis the name of the employer. In the
    circumstances where the Respondent was putting the Appellant  to  proof
    on this matter, this was a defect that could  not  have  been  remedied
    simply by oral evidence.

11. I am satisfied that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal was open to
    it on the evidence that was before it, and notwithstanding the issue in
    respect of the interpreter, I am satisfied that  the  decision  can  be
    upheld.

12. I note that post hearing the Appellant adduced  the  clearest  possible
    evidence of his wife's economic activity in the  form  of  a  statement
    from HMRC confirming that in the year ending 5 April  2018  she  earned
    �7020 at M Three & Sons, and �7800 at Roy Chicken  &  Pizza  Ltd.   The
    Appellant said that he had requested this letter before the hearing but
    it had not arrived in time.  As I explained to the Appellant, this  was
    good evidence but since it was not before the First-tier  Tribunal,  it
    cannot  be  criticised  for  failing  to  take  it  account.  In  those
    circumstances the best option would be for the Appellant to make a  new
    application,  properly  supported  by  all  of  the  relevant  evidence
    including the  determination  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  and  this
    decision (the matter of the Appellant's marriage having been determined
    in his favour). The Appellant informed me that he has been unable to do
    so because the Respondent has retained his passport whilst this  appeal
    is pending. Now that this appeal has been determined the  passport  can
    no doubt be returned to  him  so  that  he  can  make  the  appropriate
    application. Given that the Appellant  has  already  spent  many  years
    living in the United Kingdom, and that he has twice been issued with  a
    five-year residence card (on 23rd June 2008 and 31st January  2012)  he
    may wish to consider making an application for permanent residence.

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains no material  error  of
