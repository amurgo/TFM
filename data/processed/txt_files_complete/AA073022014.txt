Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Turkey born on  1st  January  1967.   The
    Appellant arrived at Heathrow by  air  from  Greece  with  a  Bulgarian
    passport on 16th September 2013.   His  baggage  was  searched  at  the
    airport and a Turkish passport and Turkish ID card were discovered.  He
    was detained.  Prior to that the Appellant had  made  two  applications
    for family visit visas both of which had been refused.

 2. On interview the Appellant confirmed that he sought entry to the UK  by
    using a Bulgarian passport  he  bought  for  ï¿½2,000.   He  advised  the
    Secretary of State that he initially sought entry  for  three  to  four
    months to sightsee before applying for  citizenship  under  the  Ankara
    Agreement and then he wanted to bring his family to the  UK.   He  said
    that he had spent all his money  on  the  Bulgarian  passport  and  had
    nothing else available.  He advised he was looking for work in  the  UK
    and that he did not wish to return  to  Turkey  because  he  was  poor.
    Removal directions were set.  He claimed  asylum.   Removal  directions
    were then cancelled.

 3. On 4th September 2014 the Appellant's application for asylum which  was
    based on a fear that if returned to Turkey he would  face  mistreatment
    due to an accusation that he was a member of the PKK was refused.   The
    Appellant appealed and the appeal came before Judge of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal M J Gillespie sitting at Hatton Cross on 6th March 2015.  In a
    determination promulgated on 16th March 2015  the  Appellant's  appeals
    for asylum and pursuant to the Human Rights Act 1998 were dismissed and
    the Appellant was found not to be in need of humanitarian protection.

 4. On 26th March 2015 Grounds of Appeal were lodged to the Upper Tribunal.
     Those grounds contended that the Immigration Judge made  an  error  in
    law and fact when he made adverse findings of credibility  against  the
    Appellant.  To come  to  this  conclusion  the  judge  had  listed  the
    inconsistencies between the accounts given by the Appellant during  his
    asylum interview and for his medical report.  It was contended that the
    judge had failed to take  into  account  the  Helen  Bamber  Foundation
    report which  provided  an  explanation  for  the  differences  in  his
    account.  It was contended that the report explained why the  Appellant
    was confused about the amount of days and the details of his  detention
    and that the Judge had  given  no  regard  to  this.   Further  it  was
    contended that the judge had failed to attach the appropriate weight to
    the conclusions in the Helen Bamber Foundation report relating  to  the
    Appellant's scars.

 5. On 1st May 2015 First-tier Tribunal Judge Astle granted  permission  to
    appeal.  On 18th May 2015 the  Secretary  of  State  responded  to  the
    Grounds of Appeal under Rule 24.  The Rule 24 response states that  the
    judge had taken account of the report of the  Helen  Bamber  Foundation
    but  noted  that  the  writer  was  not  aware   of   the   substantial
    contradictions and the history  of  regular  travel  into  and  out  of
    Turkey.  It was contended that it was not clear that  the  assessor  of
    the Helen Bamber Foundation  was  aware  of  this  travel  history  and
    further that the report  extracted  little  to  explain  the  wholesale
    inconsistencies identified.  The response concluded by stating that the
    judge  had  reviewed  all  the   evidence   and   reached   sustainable
    conclusions.

 6. It is on that basis that  the  appeal  comes  before  me  to  determine
    whether or not there is a material error of law in the decision of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge.  The Appellant  appears  by  his  instructed
    Counsel Ms Hitschmann.  Ms Hitschmann has  considerable  experience  of
    this matter.  She appeared before the First-tier Tribunal  and  she  is
    also the author of the Grounds of Appeal.  In addition she  provided  a
    skeleton argument for the First-tier Tribunal and has provided to me  a
    further skeleton argument dated 19th June 2015 in  readiness  for  this
    appeal.  The Secretary of State appears by her Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer Ms Brocklesby-Weller.

Submission/Discussion

 7. Ms Hitschmann starts by relying on the factual  basis  upon  which  the
    Appellant brought his case before the First-tier Tribunal.  These facts
    are succinctly set out at paragraphs 4 to 9 of her initial skeleton and
    in paragraph 4(a) to (f) of her skeleton for the current hearing.   The
    basis of the claim within both documents is identical namely  that  the
    Appellant was accused by the authorities of belonging to the  PKK.   He
    was arrested in May 1995 while watching the  Nevruz  festival  and  was
    released after agreeing to be an informant.  He  claims  to  have  been
    arrested again in 2000 and 2005 and during  those  detentions  to  have
    been interrogated, beaten and tortured.  He claims in August  2013  the
    authorities searched his address as they believed he was  sheltering  a
    PKK member and since leaving Turkey the authorities have  been  to  his
    address to look for him.

 8. Ms Hitschmann takes me to  paragraphs  17  and  20  of  the  First-tier
    Judge's determination indicating  that  they  address  the  credibility
    findings and asked me to look at the two accounts.   She  submits  that
    the judge should have made a finding of post-traumatic stress  disorder
    and she submits that this goes to the credibility  of  the  Appellant's
    testimony.  She relies on that submission which is found  in  both  the
    Grounds of Appeal and her skeleton argument and submits that there is a
    material error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

 9. Ms Brocklesby-Weller on behalf of  the  Secretary  of  State  takes  me
    initially to paragraph 27 of the judge's determination and states  that
    it is quite clear from that that  the  judge  has  considered  all  the
    evidence in the round and that he has also noted that the Appellant had
    stated at paragraph 21 that although the Appellant entered  the  United
    Kingdom successfully he would have disposed of his false  passport  and
    using his Turkish identity have applied for leave for  the  purpose  of
    developing  a  business  under   the   Ankara   Agreement.    In   such
    circumstances she submits that  the  Appellant  therefore  acknowledges
    that he would be in a position to travel in and out of  Turkey  without
    difficulty.

10. She takes me to paragraph 17 of the determination pointing out that the
    discrepancies in the account are dealt with therein.   She  points  out
    the Appellant appears to have given a coherent account at interview and
    latterly appears to have developed an  inability  to  allegedly  record
    dates.  She further points out there is no other evidence  produced  in
    the appeal relating to post-traumatic stress disorder  other  than  the
    Helen Bamber report and whilst she  accepts  that  some  scars  may  be
    consistent with the Appellant having been beaten  this  does  not  mean
    that the Appellant's account is credible and that it was for the  judge
    to make that finding which he has done.

11. She further points out the  judge  found  that  there  was  substantial
    reason to doubt the report and that the report made no reference to the
    refusal decision.  She takes me  to  paragraph  25  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge's decision and submits that the judge has given adequate
    weight to the report and provided adequate reasons.  She submits  there
    is no material error of law.

12. In brief response Ms Hitschmann merely states that the account  in  the
    medical report is in greater detail.

The Law

13.  Areas  of  legislative  interpretation,  failure  to  follow   binding
    authority or to distinguish it with adequate reasons, ignoring material
    considerations  by  taking  into  account  immaterial   considerations,
    reaching irrational conclusions  on  fact  or  evaluation  or  to  give
    legally inadequate reasons for the decision and procedural  unfairness,
    constitute errors of law.

14. It is not an arguable error of law for an Immigration Judge to give too
    little weight or too much weight to a factor, unless  irrationality  is
    alleged.  Nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge to fail to
    deal with every  factual  issue  of  argument.   Disagreement  with  an
    Immigration Judge's factual conclusion, his appraisal of  the  evidence
    or assessment of credibility, or his evaluation of risk does  not  give
    rise to an error of law.  Unless an Immigration Judge's  assessment  of
    proportionality is arguable as being  completely  wrong,  there  is  no
    error of law, nor is it an error of law for an Immigration Judge not to
    have regard to evidence of events arising after his decision or for him
    to have taken  no  account  of  evidence  which  was  not  before  him.
    Rationality is a very high threshold and a conclusion is not irrational
    just because some alternative explanation has been rejected or  can  be
    said to be possible.  Nor is it necessary to  consider  every  possible
    alternative  inference  consistent   with   truthfulness   because   an
    Immigration Judge concludes that the story is untrue.  If  a  point  of
    evidence of significance has been ignored or misunderstood, that  is  a
    failure to take into account a material consideration.

Findings

15. A proper approach to credibility requires an assessment of the evidence
    and of the general claim.   In  asylum  claims,  relevant  factors  are
    firstly the internal consistency of the claim,  secondly  the  inherent
    plausibility of the claim and thirdly the consistency of the claim with
    external factors of the sort typically found in country  guidance.   It
    is theoretically correct the claimant need do no more  than  state  his
    claim.  But that claim still needs to be examined for  consistency  and
    inherent plausibility.  In this case the judge has fully, and  properly
    carried out that process and analysis.  He has begun his assessment  of
    credibility and the  findings  of  fact  at  paragraph  16,  noted  the
    material discrepancies at paragraphs 17 to 20 and at paragraphs  21  to
    23 considered the consistency of the Appellant's claim.

16. However the main  thrust  of  the  allegation  against  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge is aimed at his assessment of the medical report and the
    suggestion  that  the  judge  has  failed  to  take  into  account  the
    explanation for the differences in his account.   I  completely  reject
    that contention.  It is clear paragraphs 24 to 26 that a very  detailed
    and thorough examination of the Helen Bamber Institute report has  been
    given by the judge.  Whilst noting the skeleton argument  submitted  by
    Ms Hitschmann, it does not add a great deal and merely seeks to reargue
    that this is an Appellant whose appeal should be allowed.   Submissions
    made are tantamount to disagreement  and  the  findings  of  the  judge
    rather than to disclosing any material error of law  in  his  analysis.
    The judge has looked at the facts and has made findings  which  he  was
    entitled to.  Further he has given due and proper consideration to  the
    medical report and has given adequate weight to the report when  making
    his judicial analysis.  In such circumstances I find that the  decision
    is well  reasoned  and  the  findings  are  totally  sustainable.   The
    decision discloses no material error of law and the appeal is dismissed
    and the decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge is maintained.

Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge discloses  no  material  error
of law and the appeal is  dismissed  and  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal Judge is maintained.
