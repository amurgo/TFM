    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Mr T Melvin a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: Mr D Bazini of counsel instructed by Lawrence
& Co

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance  Officer  in  Lagos  ("the  Entry
      Clearance Officer") the respondent is a citizen  of  Nigeria  who  was
      born on the 11 September 1985 ("the claimant").  The  Entry  Clearance
      Officer has been given permission to appeal the determination of First-
      Tier Tribunal Judge Blum  ("the  FTTJ")  who  allowed  her  appeal  on
      Article 8 human rights grounds against the Entry  Clearance  Officer's
      decision of 28 September 2012 to refuse to grant her  entry  clearance
      for settlement in the United Kingdom as the spouse of her husband  and
      sponsor Mr Favour Okeoma ("the sponsor"). The sponsor is a naturalised
      British citizen.


   2. The Entry Clearance Officer was not satisfied that  the  claimant  and
      the sponsor  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship.  The
      claimant  had  not  produced  the  relevant  documentary  evidence  to
      demonstrate the sponsor's  income  as  required  by  Appendix  FM  and
      Appendix FM-SE. The claimant failed the listening part of her  English
      language test. The  decision  was  reviewed  by  the  Entry  Clearance
      Manager who concluded that in any event the English language test  was
      at a level below that required.


   3. The claimant appealed and the FTTJ heard  her  appeal  on  25  October
      2013. The claimant was represented by Mr Bazini  who  appeared  before
      me. The respondent was not represented. The sponsor attended and  gave
      evidence.


   4. Whilst expressing his conclusion in an indirect way it is sufficiently
      clear that the FTTJ found the sponsor to be  a  credible  witness.  He
      concluded that the claimant and the sponsor had  established  that  at
      the date of the  decision  they  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship. This is a conclusion not now  challenged  by  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer.


   5. The FTTJ found that the claimant had not established that the  sponsor
      met the income requirements of the Appendix FM  SE.  Although  he  had
      produced six months wage  slips  and  his  Santander  bank  statements
      covering the same period the letter from his  employer  this  did  not
      state his gross annual salary.


   6. The FTTJ also found that the claimant had not shown that she  met  the
      English  language  requirements  of  Appendix  FM.  Her   marks   were
      sufficient to pass the speaking component but not the listening one.


   7. The FTTJ went on to consider  the  Article  8  human  rights  grounds,
      firstly  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  secondly   outside   the
      Immigration Rules under the Strasberg jurisprudence and the principles
      set out in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. He concluded that the first four  of
      the Razgar questions were answered in the  affirmative  and  that  the
      appeal  turned  on  the  last,  whether  the  interference  with   the
      claimant's Article 8 human rights was proportionate to the  legitimate
      public aim sought to be achieved. For reasons to which I  will  return
      he concluded that there would be a disproportionate  interference.  He
      dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules  but  allowed  it  on
      Article 8 human rights grounds.


   8. The Entry Clearance Officer applied for permission to appeal,  arguing
      that the FTTJ had erred in law by failing to  consider  whether  there
      were exceptional circumstances which meant the refusal would result in
      an unjustifiably harsh outcome. There  had  been  a  failure  to  make
      adequate findings of fact as to the sponsor's income at the  dates  of
      the application and  decision.  The  FTTJ  erred  in  relying  on  the
      judgement of Blake J in R on the application of MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900
      (Admin) which, it is argued, failed to recognise that the Secretary of
      State was entitled to formulate policy and set criteria such as income
      requirements which applicants had  to  meet.  The  provisions  in  the
      Immigration  Rules  were  not  arbitrary.  Permission  to  appeal  was
      granted.


   9. Mr Melvin relied on the grounds of  appeal  and  emphasised  that  the
      appeal had been allowed on Article 8 human rights  grounds  only.  The
      claimant had failed on  the  maintenance  and  English  language  test
      requirements under the Immigration Rules. The Judgement of Blake J  in
      MM had been overturned by the Court of Appeal  which  had  upheld  the
      income level requirements in the Immigration Rules. He submitted  that
      this was a material error of  law  and  asked  me  to  set  aside  the
      decision and remake it, dismissing the appellant's original appeal. In
      that context there were no exceptional circumstances as at the date of
      the decision. He relied on the reasons given by  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer.


  10. Mr Bazini submitted that even if the judgement of Blake  J  was  taken
      out of the equation the FTTJ gave  cogent  reasons  for  allowing  the
      appeal on Article 8 human rights grounds. The  FTTJ  was  entitled  to
      find that this was a case which should be treated differently to other
      cases. He had accepted that the sponsor was a recognised  refugee  who
      still had a well-founded fear of persecution in  Nigeria.  There  were
      insurmountable obstacles to his returning and living  there  with  the
      appellant. The  FTTJ  had  considered  this  and  the  other  material
      factors. The Entry Clearance Officer had not challenged the finding in
      paragraph 24 that the sponsor's income would be sufficient to  support
      him and the appellant. The figure at the time of the  application  was
      given in paragraph 2, namely �1250 per month which equated to  �15,000
      per annum. Read together the evidence presented at the hearing  showed
      from the sponsor's employment letter,  payslips  and  bank  statements
      that his gross pay was  approximately  �16,700  per  annum.  Also  the
      sponsor had produced evidence to show  that  he  had  a  Bond  with  a
      surrender value of �9698 and owned two properties. One was rented  out
      and produced an income and part of the other, where the sponsor lived,
      was also rented and would produce an income  until  the  claimant  was
      able to join him. The appellant had explained why she did not  achieve
      the required level of marks in the listening section  of  the  English
      language test. She took the test that she was told  was  the  required
      one,  had  to  listen  to  a  recorded  passage  and  had   difficulty
      understanding the English accent. She passed the speaking component.


  11. Mr Bazini accepted that their child had not been born at the  date  of
      the decision and the FTTJ was correct not to take this into account in
      relation to the Article 8 grounds. Nevertheless, he  emphasised  that,
      subject to the appropriate application being  made  the  child  would,
      like his father, be a British citizen.


  12. Mr Bazini argued that this  case  met  the  requirements  of  both  MF
      (Nigeria) [2013] EWCA Civ 1192 and Gulshan (Article 8 -  new  Rules  -
      correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC). I was also referred to  R  on
      the application of MM [2014] EWCA Civ 985.  This  was  an  exceptional
      case, well out of the ordinary, where the  claimant  could  not  enjoy
      family life with the sponsor in Nigeria.


  13. Mr Bazini referred to in paragraph 49 of AAO v Entry Clearance Officer
      [2011] EWCA Civ 840 mentioned by the  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge  who
      granted permission to appeal. He submitted that  the  FTTJ  had  taken
      this into account. There was no error of law and he asked me to uphold
      the decision. If there was an  error  of  law  it  was  not  material.
      However, if I was against him, he asked  me  to  remake  the  decision
      adopting the findings of fact made by the FTTJ including  the  finding
      that the sponsor was credible.


  14. Mr Melvin submitted that this was a "near miss"  case  which  did  not
      assist the  claimant.  There  were  no  exceptional  circumstances.  I
      reserved my determination.


  15. The law and the appropriate legal principles have moved on  since  the
      FTTJ heard this appeal on 25 October 2013. It predated Gulshan, MM  in
      the Court of Appeal and MF (Nigeria) also in the Court  of  Appeal.  I
      must apply the law as it now stands although  I  sympathise  with  the
      FTTJ who was applying principles as they  were  then  thought  to  be.
      Furthermore, the Entry Clearance  Officer's  grounds  of  appeal  were
      written before MM in the Court of Appeal.


  16. With hindsight and in the light of  the  judgement  of  the  Court  of
      Appeal in MM the FTTJ erred in law by finding that  the  judgement  of
      Blake J in MM meant that he  had  to  apply  a  conclusion  "that  the
      requirement of �18,600  was  disproportionate  under  Article  8  when
      applied to British citizens and recognised refugees  as  it  was  more
      intrusive than necessary in its restrictions on family life to  ensure
      that couples are self-sufficient at the  time  of  the  spouses  first
      admission."


  17. The summary of the effect of Gulshan, prepared by the author  of  that
      determination,  Cranston  J,   states;   "(b) After applying the
      requirements of the Rules, only if there may be arguably good  grounds
      for granting leave to remain outside them is it necessary for  Article
      8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are  compelling
      circumstances not  sufficiently  recognised  under  them: R  (on  the
      application  of)  Nagre  v   Secretary   of   State   for   the   Home
      Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)"; and "(c) The term "insurmountable
      obstacles" in provisions such as Section EX.1 are not obstacles  which
      are impossible to surmount: MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012]
      UKUT 393 (IAC); Izuazu (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT 45 (IAC);
      they concern the practical possibilities of relocation. In the absence
      of such insurmountable obstacles, it is necessary to show  other  non-
      standard and particular features demonstrating that  removal  will  be
      unjustifiably harsh: Nagre."


  18. MF (Nigeria) in the Court of  Appeal  was  an  appeal  relating  to  a
      foreign criminal and  included  consideration  of  whether  addressing
      Article 8 human rights grounds under the Immigration Rules  and  under
      Strasberg jurisprudence was a one stage or two stage  test,  accepting
      that the two stage process was appropriate.


  19. I find that the FTTJ, without the benefit  of  either  Gulshan  or  MF
      (Nigeria) in the Court of Appeal, although he had before him MF in the
      Upper Tribunal, correctly concluded  that  a  two  stage  process  was
      appropriate. In paragraph 19 he said; "I must engage in  a  two  stage
      approach". I find that there was a  slip  in  the  following  sentence
      which should have read and was clearly intended to say; "it  is  clear
      from the preceding findings that the appellant is  unable  to  benefit
      under the applicable provisions of the Immigration Rules  designed  to
      address Article 8 claims."


  20. In paragraph 49 of AAO Rix LJ emphasised that States were entitled  to
      have regard to their system of immigration control and it's  generally
      consistent application and a requirement that  an  entrant  should  be
      maintained  without  recourse  to  public  funds.  I  find  that   the
      conclusion in paragraph 25 of the determination that the sponsor would
      be able to maintain the appellant in the UK "at an adequate level, and
      certainly at a level above that of the  equivalent  family  on  income
      support" paid proper regard to this.


  21. The FTTJ did not consider whether, in line with  Gulshan,  there  were
      arguably good grounds for granting leave to enter outside the  Article
      8 provisions of the Immigration Rules. I find that any error of law in
      this respect was not material because, on the facts  set  out  by  the
      FTTJ, there were such arguably good grounds. The FTTJ had  found  that
      the claimant  and  the  sponsor  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
      relationship and  there  was  considerable  evidence  of  "intervening
      devotion". Furthermore the FTTJ found, for  the  reasons  set  out  in
      paragraph 24, that the sponsor still had a  genuine  and  well-founded
      fear of persecution in Nigeria which would  prevent  him  from  living
      there with the appellant.


  22. The FTTJ did not, at least  in  terms,  consider  whether  there  were
      compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised   under   the
      Immigration Rules for granting leave to enter. I find that the reasons
      he gave did amount to such compelling circumstances. Perhaps the  most
      telling of these is the sponsor's inability to go and  live  with  the
      claimant in Nigeria because of his  continuing  well-founded  fear  of
      persecution. This is  not  a  conclusion  which  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer has challenged. In line with Gulshan the claimant did not need
      to show "insurmountable obstacles" amounting to obstacles  which  were
      impossible to surmount. In the context of this appeal the obstacles of
      sufficient severity were those which prevented the  claimant  and  the
      sponsor living together in the UK if she was refused  entry  clearance
      or in Nigeria because of his fear of  persecution.  It  has  not  been
      suggested that they could live together anywhere else. The FTTJ  found
      the sponsor to be a credible witness. The Entry Clearance Officer  has
      not challenged this finding or indeed the other findings of fact.  The
      sponsor is a British citizen. He is gainfully employed here. Whilst he
      did not produce the required documents to show  that  he  was  earning
      �18,600 per annum the FTTJ found him credible and his evidence that he
      was earning �1250 per month gross which equates to �15,000 per  annum.
      The sponsor also owned two properties one of which  was  let  and  the
      other part let until such time as the claimant was able to  join  him.
      The Entry Clearance Officer did not accept that the claimant  and  the
      sponsor were in a genuine and subsisting relationship. The FTTJ  found
      that they were and the Entry Clearance Officer has not challenged that
      conclusion. I do not apply any "near miss" argument but factors which,
      in the round, persuade me that  there  was  no  material  error  which
      should lead me to set aside the decision of the FTTJ. On that evidence
      it would have been open to him to conclude that  the  requirements  of
      the two stage test set out in Gulshan were met and that  the  claimant
      was entitled to succeed on Article 8 human rights grounds outside  the
      Immigration Rules.


  23. The FTTJ did not make an anonymity direction. I have not been asked to
      do so and can see no good reason to make such a direction.


  24. I uphold the decision of the FTTJ to allow the  appeal  on  Article  8
      human rights grounds.
