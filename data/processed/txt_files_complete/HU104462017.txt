                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing the applicant's  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds outside the Rules against the decision  of  13  September  2017
    refusing him leave to remain on the grounds of his family  and  private
    life.  In this decision I will refer to the parties as they were before
    the First-tier  Tribunal,  the  applicant  as  the  appellant  and  the
    Secretary of State as the respondent.

Background.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born on 6 May 1968.   He  married
    his former wife in Nigeria in 2001 and their first child  was  born  in
    2002.  He came to the UK on 7 February  2006  with  entry  clearance  a
    spouse and his leave was extended on two  further  occasions  until  11
    March 2010.  However, by that stage  difficulties  had  arisen  in  the
    marriage and the appellant had  returned  to  Nigeria  for  some  seven
    months while he and  his  wife's  family  attempted  to  resolve  their
    problems. He  sold  his  properties  in  Nigeria  and  made  the  funds
    available to his wife.  In May 2009 he returned to the UK and initially
    there were no issues but subsequently  arguments  about  money  started
    again.  In 2011 on return from work he found  that  the  locks  of  the
    family home had been changed and he had been locked out.  He  lived  on
    his own until 2013 when he met his  current  partner.   They  moved  in
    together in 2014 and they intend to marry.

3.   The appellant applied for further leave  to  remain  in  2013  but  his
    application was refused as he did not have any documentary evidence  in
    a court order of his contact with his children.  He then applied for  a
    contact  order,  but  his  wife  said  that,  unless  he  withdrew  the
    application, she would not allow him to see the children and, following
    a hearing in the Family Court, the judge only allowed  indirect  access
    by post.  The appellant had been granted discretionary leave to  remain
    until 5 May 2013 but a subsequent application for leave was refused  on
    25 June 2013.  That decision was later reconsidered and he was  granted
    leave from 16 May 2016 until 31  August  2016.   The  application,  the
    subject of this appeal, was made on 26 August 2016.

4.   The respondent was not satisfied that  the  appellant  could  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules or, having  taken  into  account  under  para
    GEN.3.3. of Appendix FM the best interests of his children, that  there
    were any exceptional circumstances within  para  GEN.3.2.  which  would
    result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  for  him  or  any  relevant
    child.

The Hearing Before the First-tier Tribunal.

5.   The judge found that the appellant could not meet the requirements  for
    leave to remain as a parent, as he did not have sole responsibility for
    his children; they did not live with him and he  did  not  have  direct
    access to them either as agreed with their mother or  by  court  order.
    She went on to consider the application on private life  grounds  under
    para 276ADE of the Rules but found that the appellant  would  not  face
    very significant obstacles to integrating into life in  Nigeria  as  he
    could find employment, he had family members there as did  his  present
    partner, whose father and four brothers lived in Nigeria and she was in
    contact with them.  The family home  was  not  currently  occupied  and
    there was no reason why the appellant would be unable to  reside  there
    if he returned.

6.   She went on to consider the provisions of para GEN.3.2.,  finding  that
    there were no exceptional circumstances to justify  a  grant  of  leave
    within that provision.  A court order was  extant  in  which  a  Family
    Court judge had found  that  it  was  in  the  best  interests  of  the
    appellant's children that he did not have direct contact with them.  It
    would not be an unjustifiably harsh consequence for him to  be  removed
    from the UK as he could continue with indirect  contact.   His  current
    partner was a Nigerian national who had obtained UK citizenship in 2016
    but she retained strong  family  links  with  Nigeria  and  could  find
    employment there, albeit at a lower salary.

7.   The judge then went on to consider the application outside  the  Rules.
    She said that there was a gap in the Rules, in that she  must  consider
    the likelihood of the appellant  being  granted  leave  to  enter  from
    outside the UK as  a  partner  applying  the  guidance  in  R  (on  the
    application of Chen) v Secretary of State (Appendix FM -  Chikwamba -
    temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 189.  She found
    that family life was engaged, removing the appellant to  Nigeria  would
    be an interference of sufficient gravity to engage article  8  and  the
    decision was made for a  legitimate  aim.   She  went  on  to  consider
    whether the interference would  be  proportionate  to  that  legitimate
    public aim.  She found that the appellant had provided evidence that he
    would be granted leave to enter as a partner  on  an  application  from
    Nigeria now and then said at [63]:

         "Weight must  be  given  to  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
         effective immigration controls.  Weight can be given to the  family
         life that the appellant has established in the UK, as the appellant
         was in the UK lawfully.  The appellant would meet the  requirements
         for leave to enter as a partner, now.  For  these  reasons  I  find
         that the decision  is  disproportionate  to  the  aim  to  maintain
         effective immigration controls and is in breach of the  appellant's
         right to family life."

8.   Accordingly, the appeal was allowed on human rights grounds.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions.

9.   In the grounds of appeal, it is argued that the provisions of  GEN.3.2.
    had been introduced into the Rules in August 2017 in  response  to  the
    Supreme Court judgment in Agyarko v Secretary of State [2017]  UKSC  11
    and this amendment essentially made Appendix FM a  complete  code.   It
    had brought within the Rules the test approved by the Supreme Court for
    deciding  when  an  appellant  who  could  not  meet  the   substantive
    requirements of Appendix FM should, nevertheless, be allowed to  remain
    because his removal would be a disproportionate breach of his article 8
    rights.

10.   The  judge  had  erred,  so  the  grounds  argue,  by  undertaking   a
    freewheeling  article  8  proportionality  exercise  and,  whilst   the
    relevance of Chikwamba v Secretary of State [2008] UKHL 40 was somewhat
    hard to determine, given the developments in the Rules, legislation and
    case law, in the absence of a finding that  a  brief  separation  while
    entry clearance was sought was an unjustifiably harsh consequence,  the
    judge was not entitled to find that there would be  a  disproportionate
    interference with the  article  8  rights  of  the  appellant  and  his
    partner.  In  any  event,  the  judge  was  required  to  consider  the
    application of the substantive Rules to the new relationship  and  this
    she had failed to do.

11.  Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  the
    basis that the conclusion on disproportionality pivoted on the  finding
    at [63] that the appellant had established that  he  would  be  granted
    entry clearance as a  partner  were  he  to  make  an  out  of  country
    application, but it was arguable that in  the  light  of  the  previous
    finding of no unjustifiable harshness and the developments in  the  law
    since Chikwamba that the judge's conclusion was in error.

12.  In his submissions Mr Whitwell referred to the judgment  of  the  Court
    of Appeal in R (on the application of Kaur) v Secretary of State [2018]
    EWCA Civ  1423.   He  submitted  that  Chikwamba  had  dealt  with  the
    situation within the Asylum Policy Instruction and  was  a  case  where
    there was a procedural requirement under the Rules requiring  a  person
    to make an application for entry clearance from  outside  the  UK.   He
    referred to [43] of Kaur and the fact that the facts in Chikwamba  were
    striking.  At [45] the Court had  said  that  the  Chikwamba  principle
    would require a fact specific assessment in each case  and  would  only
    apply in a very clear case and, even then, would not necessarily result
    in a grant of leave to remain.

13.  He referred to [39] of Chen which held that  if  it  was  shown  by  an
    individual that an application for entry clearance from abroad would be
    granted and that there would be significant  interference  with  family
    life by temporary removal, the weight to  be  accorded  to  the  formal
    requirement of entry clearance was reduced and that, in cases involving
    children where removal would interfere with the  child's  enjoyment  of
    family life with one or other  of  his  or  her  parents  whilst  entry
    clearance was obtained, it would be easier to show that the balance  on
    proportionality fell in favour  of  the  claimant  than  in  cases  not
    involving children  but  where  removal  interfered  with  family  life
    between parties who knowingly entered  into  the  relationship  in  the
    knowledge that family life was being established whilst the immigration
    status of one party was precarious.

14.  Mr Whitwell submitted that there had been no finding by  the  judge  on
    whether the appellant's  partner  would  remain  in  the  UK  while  an
    application was made. The precariousness of the  appellant's  leave  to
    remain had not been taken into account and the judge had not  made  any
    adequate findings to support her conclusion that  the  appellant  could
    now meet the requirements of the Rules within Appendix FM.

15.  Mr Siriwardena submitted that the judge had  not  erred  in  law.   The
    appellant's partner was a senior staff nurse in a  mental  health  ward
    and the appellant was a carer in an old people's home.   There  was  no
    evidence how long an application for entry clearance would take and the
    position now was that the appellant had received his  decree  nisi  and
    the situation had changed so far as contact was concerned.   He  argued
    that the judge had carried out the balancing exercise properly and  had
    been entitled to find in the appellant's favour.  It  would  be  unduly
    harsh, so he submitted, for the appellant to be required to  return  to
    Nigeria to make an application.  The Rules did not need to be slavishly
    followed and the appellant and  his  partner  had  entered  into  their
    relationship in good faith.

Assessment of whether the First-tier Tribunal Erred in Law.

16.  I must consider whether the judge erred in law such that  the  decision
    should be set aside.  I am satisfied that the judge has  erred  in  the
    following ways.  Having found that the appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of  the  Rules  and  in  particular  that  there  were  no
    exceptional circumstances under GEN.3.2., having taken account  of  the
    best interests of the children in GEN.3.3., the judge said  that  there
    was a gap in the Rules and she must  consider  the  likelihood  of  the
    appellant being granted leave  to  enter  from  outside  the  UK  as  a
    partner.  She then carried out  what  was  in  effect  a  free  ranging
    article 8 assessment without following  the  guidance  of  the  Supreme
    Court in Agyarko at [54] - [60] that  there  needed  to  be  compelling
    circumstances for a human rights claim to succeed  outside  the  Rules.
    The assessment of the impact of Chikwamba was not  considered  in  that
    context nor in the light  of  the  finding  that  there  would  not  be
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for the appellant within GEN.3.2.

17.  I am also satisfied that  the  judge  overstated  the  significance  of
    Chikwamba, an appeal decided in 2008 prior to the extensive  amendments
    to the Rules in 2012 and subsequently.   The  Upper  Tribunal  said  in
    Hayat v the Secretary of State [2011] UKUT 444 that the significance of
    Chikwamba was to make plain that where the only matter weighing on  the
    respondent's side of the balance was the public policy of  requiring  a
    person to apply under the Rules from abroad, that legitimate  objective
    would usually be outweighed by factors resting on the appellant's  side
    of the balance.  But in  Kaur,  the  Court  of  Appeal  held  that  the
    judgment in Chikwamba did not justify inclusion of the  word  "usually"
    in that approach.  In this context the Court referred to the passage of
    Lord Reed in Agyarko referring to Chikwamba where he had noted that the
    reference was to an applicant who was "certain to be granted  leave  to
    enter" and that in such a case there might be  no  public  interest  in
    removing the applicant.  The Court held that  the  Chikwamba  principle
    would require a fact specific assessment in each case  and  would  only
    apply in a very clear case and would not necessarily result in a  grant
    of leave to remain.

18.  Further, the judge did not explain in her decision how it was that  she
    was satisfied that the appellant would be granted leave to enter  as  a
    partner.  No adequate reasons are given for this conclusion.  This  is,
    therefore, not a case where the only  factor  weighing  in  the  public
    interest is the need to make an application  from  abroad.   The  judge
    referred to s.117B of the 2002 Act, but the fact  remains  that  family
    life with his partner was established when his  leave  in  the  UK  was
    precarious as he did not have indefinite leave to remain.

19.  For these reasons I am satisfied that the errors of law  by  the  judge
    are such that the decision should be set aside and, in the light of the
    issues raised, should be remade in  the  Upper  Tribunal,  rather  than
    being remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  I made  further  directions
    to enable the appellant to update the position relating to  his  family
    life.

Further Evidence.

20.  At the resumed hearing  a  further  bundle  of  documents  indexed  and
    paginated A1-C66 was filed on behalf of the appellant.  He gave further
    oral evidence in accordance with his witness statement dated  27  March
    2019 (A3-6).  He explained that his partner, whose witness statement is
    at A7-8, was not able to attend  the  hearing  as  she  had  to  attend
    mandatory training as a nurse.  He confirmed that  he  understood  that
    the threshold income for a grant of entry clearance  as  a  spouse  was
    about �18,500 and that his partner earned in excess of that.  He had no
    criminal convictions.  He and his partner been living together for five
    years and his divorce from his previous wife had now come through.   He
    understood that the cost of making a visa application in Nigeria  would
    be about �1050 and he thought the application would  take  about  three
    months, but a friend had said that it could take longer.


21.  He accepted that his immigration status was precarious.   He  explained
    that he had taken out a number of loans to  obtain  qualifications  for
    his present employment as a support worker and to buy a car needed  for
    that work.  He had to visit  elderly  people  and  this  would  not  be
    possible by public transport.  If he had to stay in Nigeria,  his  loan
    payments would pile up.  He could get a job there and would earn  about
    80,000 naira, about �200, but this was not enough to finance his loans.
     By this May he would have been in the UK for 10 years.   He  explained
    that he belonged to a health care professional body and needed to  keep
    up with training.


22.  In cross-examination he said that he could not  have  got  his  present
    job without his own transport.  He worked 40 hours in a care  home  and
    did agency work of up to 20 hours a week.  He  confirmed  that  he  had
    taken out his loans so that he could obtain and carry out his job.   He
    was paying a total of  about  �800  a  month  to  pay  them  off.   His
    household bills were paid by his partner and they shared  the  cost  of
    their present accommodation.  He was asked whether he would be able  to
    get work on return to the UK and he thought that would  depend  on  how
    long he was away. He could not continue to pay off the loans in Nigeria
    whilst  waiting  for  his  application  for  entry  clearance   to   be
    considered. If his application for entry clearance was not  successful,
    he said it would cause his partner a lot of distress  and  he  did  not
    know what she would do as she believed that he would be  able  to  come
    back.


Further submissions.

23.  Ms Kenny submitted that it will be entirely reasonable  to  expect  the
    appellant to return  to  Nigeria  to  make  an  application  for  entry
    clearance.  She relied on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in  Kaur,
    submitting that this was not a case where the appellant was certain  to
    be granted leave to enter.  She argued that he had acted  irresponsibly
    by taking out loans when  he  knew  that  his  immigration  status  was
    precarious.  There were  no  exceptional  or  compelling  circumstances
    justifying a grant of leave outside the Rules.


24.  Mr Siri, referring to Kaur,  submitted  that  each  appeal  had  to  be
    looked at on a case-by-case basis.  The appellant and his partner would
    be able to meet the requirements of the Rules and he  had  no  criminal
    convictions or civil judgments against him.  He also had only a  matter
    of weeks to go before completing 10 years residence in the  UK.  Taking
    the length of his residence into account with the fact that  he  had  a
    very  good  chance   of   obtaining   a   visa,   removal   would   the
    disproportionate.  The fact that the appellant's status was  precarious
    had to be balanced with the fact that he was in employment valuable  to
    the community as was his partner.  There would be  an  unnecessary  and
    disproportionate disruption to both their lives, so he argued,  if  the
    appellant had to return to Nigeria even for a short period to  make  an
    application for entry clearance.


Assessment of the issues.


25.  It is not  in  dispute  that  the  appellant  is  unable  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules for entry clearance either as a parent  or  a
    partner.  As set out in the  decision  letter  he  does  not  meet  the
    eligibility requirements of E-LTRPT.2.2.-2.4. as he was unable to  show
    that he had direct access to his children by his previous marriage.  He
    was granted discretionary leave which enabled him to pursue a claim for
    contact but following hearings in the Family Court  the  appellant  was
    only granted indirect contact.  In his recent witness statement at [13]
    the appellant refers to a hearing when the judge told him that it be  a
    waste of his time and money to try and obtain contact with his children
    as his former wife had done everything possible  to  avoid  him  having
    contact.  This is clearly a sad and unhappy situation but, nonetheless,
    the appellant is unable to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules  in
    relation to his contact with his children.

26.  The First-tier Tribunal judge found that  the  provisions  of  GEN  3.2
    were not met and that there were no exceptional circumstances  relating
    to the best interests of the children requiring  further  consideration
    under the Rules and further, that there would not be  very  significant
    obstacles to the appellant integrating into life in  Nigeria.  This  is
    confirmed by the appellant's acceptance that he has  accommodation  and
    could find work in Nigeria. For the sake of completeness, it must  also
    follow from the findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  from  the
    further evidence  that  this  is  not  a  case  where  there  would  be
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  with  his  partner  continuing
    outside the UK within para EX.1.


27.  It is not in dispute that removing the appellant would  interfere  with
    his family life to such an extent as to engage article 8, the  decision
    is in accordance with the law and is for the legitimate aim maintaining
    effective  immigration  control  as  part  of  the  legitimate  aim  of
    protecting the economic well-being of the UK.  The issue, therefore, is
    whether the interference would be proportionate to a legitimate  public
    aim.


28.  I must approach this assessment in accordance with the  guidance  given
    by the Supreme Court in cases such as Agyarko (see  [16]  above)  which
    sets out the importance of taking into account in assessing the  public
    interest the policy of the Secretary of State as set out in the  Rules.
    The Court held that there needed to be compelling circumstances  for  a
    claim on human rights grounds to succeed outside the Rules.

29.  A factor of importance when assessing family life  is  whether  it  was
    formed at a time when  the  appellant  had  only  precarious  leave  to
    remain.  In Rhuppiah v Secretary of State [2018] UKSC 2018 the  Supreme
    Court confirmed that a person who was not a UK citizen but  present  in
    the UK with  leave  to  reside  here  other  than  indefinitely  had  a
    precarious immigration status, which had to be taken into account  when
    assessing proportionality.  In Agyarko at [49], the Court  referred  to
    the judgment of the ECtHR in Jeunesse v Netherlands [2015] 60  ECRR  17
    and in particular to the statement that in cases of  precarious  family
    life it was likely to be only in exceptional circumstances that removal
    would constitute a breach of article 8.


30.  The appellant's marriage finally broke  down  in  2011  after  previous
    difficulties which had led him to return to Nigeria in 2008,  returning
    to the UK in 2009. He applied for further leave to remain in  2013  and
    subsequent applications were successful to a limited extent in that  he
    was granted discretionary leave until 5 May 2013 and again from 16  May
    2016 until 31 August  2016  giving  him  the  opportunity  of  pursuing
    contact proceedings in relation to his three children in  the  UK.   He
    moved in with his partner in 2014 and it is  clearly  their  wish  that
    should continue to live in the UK.  His partner is a UK citizen but has
    strong links to Nigeria.

31.  I must take into account the factors set out  in  s.117B  of  the  2002
    Act.  The maintenance of  effective  immigration  controls  is  in  the
    public interest: s.117B(1). The appellant can speak English and  he  is
    not a burden on taxpayers as he  is  working.   The  provisions  of  s.
    117B(4) and (5) do not apply but his family life was  formed  when  his
    status was precarious.  He  is  unable  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    s.117B(6).

32.  It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that if he had to return  to
    Nigeria, he would have difficulty maintaining his loan  repayments  and
    he and his partner would be in  difficulty  in  meeting  their  current
    outgoings.  However, no evidence has been produced  to  show  that  any
    attempt has been made to obtain any deferment of the repayments  or  to
    obtain a short-term loan to cover repayments whilst the appellant makes
    an application from abroad.  In any event, these loans were obtained by
    the appellant at a time when he knew his leave was precarious.

33.  It is further argued that it would  take  three  months,  perhaps  even
    longer, to obtain entry clearance and there  would  be  the  additional
    costs of the application but there is no reason to believe  that  there
    would be any undue delay in deciding his application and the  costs  of
    the application have to be met by all who apply.

34.  It is further argued that in May 2019 he will  have  been  residing  in
    the UK for 10 years.  Whilst I take into  account  the  length  of  his
    residence, a possible future claim which has not yet crystallised is  a
    matter of relatively little weight.

35.  I must also take into account the judgment of the Court  of  Appeal  in
    Kaur that in cases where it is asserted that an appellant can now  meet
    the requirements of the Rules, it must be shown that the  appellant  is
    "certain to be granted leave to enter" and that in such  a  case  there
    might be no public interest in removing the appellant.

36.  The appellant does not satisfy me that he  is  certain  to  be  granted
    entry clearance.  His claim that he meets the financial requirements of
    the Rules is substantially based on his assertions but neither  he  nor
    his partner have provided in the documents produced for this appeal the
    specified  evidence  required  to  be  submitted  in  support   of   an
    application for entry  clearance  as  set  out  in  the  provisions  of
    appendix FM-SE, para 2 in relation to salaried employment.  The  public
    interest in the maintenance of immigration controls includes  requiring
    applications for entry clearance to be made and assessed in  accordance
    with the specific requirements of the Rules  including  the  evidential
    provisions.

37.   I  am  not  satisfied  that  these  various  factors  individually  or
    cumulatively  approach  the   kind   of   compelling   or   exceptional
    circumstances  which  could  justify  a  finding  that  requiring   the
    appellant to comply with the requirements of the  Rules  would  in  his
    circumstances be disproportionate.


38.  Accordingly, I am not satisfied that removing the  appellant  would  be
    disproportionate to a legitimate aim or  that  it  is  unreasonable  to
    expect him to make a claim in accordance with the Rules.


Decision.


39.  The First-tier Tribunal erred in law and  the  decision  has  been  set
    aside. I remake the decision by dismissing the appeal on  human  rights
    grounds.  The anonymity order made by the First-tier  Tribunal  remains
    in force until further order.
