Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms S Saifolahi, Counsel, instructed by Breytenbachs
                    Immigration Consultants Ltd
For the Respondent:    Ms K Pal, Specialist Appeals Team


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dismissing her appeal against the decision of the respondent to  refuse
    to grant her leave to remain  on  human  rights  grounds  either  under
    Appendix FM or outside the Rules.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make
    an anonymity direction, and do not consider that the appellant requires
    anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.



The Relevant Factual Background

 2. The appellant is a national of  Georgia,  whose  date  of  birth  is  6
    December 1980.   She  admits  to  having  entered  the  United  Kingdom
    illegally  in  April  2009.   On  22  December  2011  she  was  granted
    discretionary leave to remain until 15 February 2015 on  the  basis  of
    her relationship with [MO], whom she married in 2011.   They  separated
    at the end of 2012, and the appellant began a relationship  with  [DP],
    and moved into his accommodation in March 2013.

 3. On 29 January 2015 she  applied  for  further  discretionary  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.  The application was refused on 17  March
    2015 because her relationship with [MO] was no longer subsisting.   The
    Secretary of State was not satisfied that the grounds under  which  she
    had previously been granted discretionary leave still persisted.

 4. A decision was also made under the partner route in Appendix FM.   [DP]
    did not meet the definition of a partner contained in GEN.1.2.  For she
    provided no evidence that she was married to or been living  with  [DP]
    in a relationship akin to marriage or a civil partnership for at  least
    two years prior to the date of application.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The judge's findings are  set  out  at  paragraphs  [16]  onwards.   In
    paragraph [17] he observed that the respondent did  not  challenge  the
    dates of the relationship  between  the  appellant  and  [DP]  and  the
    Presenting  Officer  also  accepted  there  were  sufficient  financial
    resources to meet the income threshold of �18,600 specified in Appendix
    FM of the Immigration Rules.   The  Presenting  Officer  also  did  not
    challenge the evidence that the relationship between the appellant  and
    [DP] was genuine and subsisting, that they intended  to  live  together
    permanently in the  UK  and  they  had  accommodation  which  would  be
    adequate without recourse to public funds.

 6. The judge went on to consider whether EX.1 applied.  He found  that  it
    did not apply, for the reasons he gave in paragraphs [20] and [21].

 7. The judge turned to consider the suggestion by the  Presenting  Officer
    that it would be reasonable to expect  the  appellant  to  go  back  to
    Georgia to make an application for entry clearance to settle in the  UK
    as a partner.  The judge held that, although her return to  Georgia  to
    make an application for entry clearance  might  entail  some  practical
    problems and elements of hardship, they were not of  sufficient  weight
    or seriousness to amount to insurmountable obstacles and would not make
    her removal from the UK disproportionate.  He cited Butt [2015] CSIH 72
    and R on the application of Chen) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -   temporary   separation   -
    proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC).

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 8. The application for permission to appeal was settled by Ms Saifolahi of
    Counsel, who had appeared for the appellant before Judge Nicholls.   In
    ground 1, she referred to what the judge had said at paragraph [17]  of
    the decision.  As the respondent had not challenged  the  core  of  the
    requirements to be met in Appendix FM for leave to remain as a partner,
    she submitted that the Tribunal had erred in law in not reasoning  why,
    given the acceptance of the facts within paragraph [17], the  appellant
    did not meet the requirements of Appendix FM.  If the appellant met the
    substantive requirements of Appendix FM, she would  not  need  to  rely
    upon EX.1.

 9. Ground 2 was that the Tribunal had erred in the  application  of  Chen.
    Counsel cited a passage from Chen, in which Upper Tribunal  Judge  Gill
    observed at paragraph [40] that in Chikwamba it was  accepted  that  an
    application for entry clearance would succeed, and  this  consideration
    went in the claimant's favour.  Judge Gill continued:

         "To state the obvious, if an individual makes  an  application  for
         leave to remain on the basis of Article 8, the Secretary  of  State
         is only obliged to reach a decision on that  application.   She  is
         not obliged to consider further (although she is not prevented from
         doing so if  she  wishes  to)  whether  an  application  for  entry
         clearance would succeed."

10. Ms Saifolahi submitted that the  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  in  not
    applying the facts of the appellant's case the findings made  in  Chen,
    given that:

      a) it was not challenge that the appellant could meet the requirements
         of Appendix FM;

      b) it was not challenged that the appellant's partner  had  a  contact
         order in place relating to his weekly contact with his 10 year  old
         son; and

      c) it was not disputed that the appellant had recently been  sectioned
         and been allocated a care coordinator.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

11. On 23 August 2015 Judge Pooler granted permission to appeal  on  ground
    1, but not on ground 2.  He held that it was arguable  that  the  judge
    had misdirected himself in law in terms of the requirements  which  had
    to be met under Appendix FM.  But there was no arguable error of law in
    the judge going on  to  find  that  the  temporary  separation  of  the
    appellant and her  British  citizen  partner  (while  she  returned  to
    Georgia and applied for entry clearance) was not disproportionate.   He
    had properly directed himself in law and he had reached findings and  a
    conclusion in this respect which  were  open  to  him  and  which  were
    adequately reasoned.

The Rule 24 Response

12. In the Rule 24 Response dated 8 September 2016, Julie Isherwood of  the
    Specialists  Appeals  Team  opposed  the  appeal  on  ground  1.    She
    submitted that the  appellant  could  not  succeed  under  Appendix  FM
    because the couple had not lived together for two years at the date  of
    application.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

13. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law was  made
    out, Ms Saifolahi acknowledged the  force  of  the  Rule  24  Response.
    Nonetheless she submitted that  there  was  an  error  in  the  judge's
    reasoning in paragraph [17].  She agreed with me that, on analysis, she
    had a stronger argument under ground 2, but she  faced  the  difficulty
    that she had not been granted permission to appeal on ground 2.

Discussion and Findings

14. Permission to appeal on ground 1 was granted  on  the  basis  that  the
    judge had arguably erred in  law  in  only  looking  at  EX.1  and  not
    considering the alternative route by which the appellant qualified  for
    leave to remain under Appendix FM, which was that she met  the  minimum
    income threshold of �18,600 per annum.

15. However, the judge did not err in failing to take the  course  proposed
    by Ms Saifolahi.  This was because  the  appellant  did  not  meet  the
    condition precedent for the grant of leave to remain under Appendix FM;
    [DP] needed to be a partner of the appellant within the definition of a
    partner contained in GEN.1.2.

16. For the same reason, it was not strictly necessary  for  the  judge  to
    consider EX.1.  The line taken in  the  refusal  letter  was  that  the
    appellant could not benefit from the criteria set out in EX.1,  as  she
    did not meet all the mandatory eligibility requirements.   But  as  the
    central thrust of the appellant's case before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was that it was not be possible for her and [DP] to settle in  Georgia,
    the judge needed  to  make  findings  on  this  question,  and  it  was
    convenient for him to do so within the context of  a  consideration  of
    the application of EX.1. But if the judge had found in the  appellant's
    favour on this issue, he would only have been able to allow the  appeal
    outside the Rules.

17. Ms Saifolahi identified one error in the judge's  chain  of  reasoning,
    but the error  is  not  material.   The  judge  questions  whether  the
    appellant is eligible for consideration under EX.1 on the basis of  her
    immigration status.  He  refers  to  the  fact  she  was  only  granted
    discretionary  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  having  entered  the  UK
    illegally, and he appears to be of the view that this places her within
    the scope of E-LTRP.2.2 which provides as follows:

         "The applicant must not be in the UK -

          a) on temporary admission or temporary release, unless  paragraph
             EX.1 applies; or

          b)  breach  of  immigration  laws  (disregarding  any  period  of
             overstaying for a period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph
             EX.1 applies."

18. In fact, as acknowledged in the Rule 24 Response, the appellant met the
    immigration status requirements to be eligible  for  limited  leave  to
    remain as a partner.

19. The fact that the judge has  erred  in  this  regard  is  not  directly
    material, as it did not have a bearing on  his  assessment  of  whether
    EX.1 applied.  Equally, it did not have a bearing on the fact that  the
    appellant was not eligible for leave to remain under  Appendix  FM  for
    another reason, which was that [DP] did not meet the  definition  of  a
    partner.

20. Arguably, the judge's misdirection had an impact on his  assessment  of
    the Chikwamba question.  He began his discussion on this topic with the
    observation  that  the  appellant's   immigration   history   was   not
    particularly in her favour.  Prime facie the slate was wiped clean when
    the appellant was granted discretionary leave to remain in 2011. At the
    date of the hearing she had remained lawfully  in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 2011.  So this was not  a  classic  case  where  the  applicant's
    adverse immigration history provided a good reason  for  requiring  the
    applicant to return to the country of origin to regularise his  or  her
    status.

21. However, the appellant was not granted permission to appeal  on  ground
    2.  Moreover, the judge was not saying that the  appellant  had  to  go
    back to make an application for entry clearance.

22. The judge simply did not address the alternative  and  more  attractive
    possibility of the appellant making an in-country application for leave
    to remain, now that [DP] met the definition of a partner in GEN.1.2.

23.  Provided  that  the  application  was  made  within  30  days  of  the
    appellant's appeal rights being deemed to be  exhausted,  she  was  not
    going to be treated as an overstayer and so  ineligible  for  leave  to
    remain under Appendix FM.

24. Since, as the judge found at paragraph [22], the qualifying  conditions
    of a genuine relationship, income, and accommodation were likely to  be
    met, the prospects of the  appellant  making  a  successful  in-country
    application were (and still are)  just  as  good  as  making  one  from
    Georgia; and she would  be  (and  still  will  be)  able  to  make  the
    application without the practical problems  and  elements  of  hardship
    which the judge acknowledged would arise if she  made  the  application
    from Georgia,

25. For the above reasons, I find that there is no material error of law in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
