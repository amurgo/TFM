For the Respondent:    Mr S Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is the appeal against a decision reached  by  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Martins following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 22 January 2015 in
    a  determination  dated  27  February  2015  when  she  dismissed   the
    appellant's appeal against  a  decision  of  27  May  2014  to  make  a
    deportation order in  relation  to  him.  The  Appellant  asked  us  to
    consider making an anonymity direction in this case but we can  see  no
    basis upon which such an order should be made and have declined  to  do
    so.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Belgium who  was  born  on  22  September
    1972.  In terms of the issues that were raised in this appeal it is not
    necessary to delve deeply into the history of the  matter  and  how  he
    came to find himself before FtTJ Martins.  It suffices for us  to  note
    that he arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  in  1993  having  first  been
    cautioned on 4 July 1994 for criminal damage.  He then, between October
    1994 and March 2014, has been convicted of 99  offences  including  ten
    offences against the  person,  seven  offences  against  property,  two
    thefts and light offences, 23 public order offences, nineteen  offences
    relating  to  the  authorities  for  drug   offences   and   34   other
    miscellaneous offences.

3.   During his submissions before us Mr Hebbreecht has been keen  to  point
    out that some of these may have  been  overstated  and  that  on  other
    occasions he may have pleaded guilty on  advice  or  tactically  rather
    than because he genuinely felt he was guilty of  the  offence.   Whilst
    that is understood and his feelings in that respect are respected those
    submissions are of no materiality to us as we have to take his criminal
    record as it is presented in the documentation and  cannot  reopen  the
    circumstances of that litany of offending.

4.   On 24 March 2014 at the North West Magistrates' Court he was  convicted
    of battery, destroying or damaging property and breach of a conditional
    discharge.  He was sentenced to ten weeks' imprisonment and ordered  to
    pay a ï¿½100 fine.  That led to the service upon him on 27  May  2014  of
    the notice of a decision to make a deportation  order  in  relation  to
    him.  Although a deportation order was made on 1 August  2014  it  then
    came to light that he had lodged an out  of  time  appeal  against  the
    earlier decision on 30 July 2014, leading to the matter  being  brought
    on before FtTJ Martins.

5.   Prior to the hearing on 22  January  2015  Mr  Hebbreecht  had  made  a
    number of appearances at bail  hearings  where  he  had  sought  to  be
    released from detention.  It is clear  from  the  helpful  decision  in
    relation to the grant of permission to appeal by FtTJ  Landes  in  this
    case that so far as the hearing is concerned there are contained on the
    Tribunal's file notices of 5 September 2014 and 11 September 2014 which
    included directions and a notification of the hearing which  have  been
    sent by post to HMP Wormwood Scrubs and returned marked "addressee gone
    away".  That was surprising bearing in mind that the appellant had been
    held at HMP Wormwood Scrubs during that time.  In  fact  the  appellant
    was produced at the hearing on 22 January 2015 and during the course of
    the hearing this morning he accepted that he knew that that was for the
    purposes of his appeal albeit that he felt unprepared  to  address  the
    issues at the appeal and appeared without  documentation  and  was  not
    feeling well.

6.   He also wished for reasons that we shall turn to in due course to  have
    available the material  that  he  furnished  in  support  of  his  bail
    applications.  That material he advises both in the grounds  of  appeal
    and in his submissions to us today included information on two  topics,
    firstly his employment history  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  secondly
    documents  which  pertained   to   the   opportunities   he   had   for
    rehabilitation in the United Kingdom and which evidenced his earnest of
    seeking to address the causes of his offending.

7.   In any event, as we have explained, he attended on 22 January 2015  and
    represented himself before FtTJ Martins.  She having heard the evidence
    reached the following findings and conclusions:

         "57. I had the opportunity of hearing and observing  the  appellant
             give evidence.  It  was  clear  that  the  appellant  is  very
             confused about his time in the United Kingdom, particularly in
             terms of the employment he has had.  He attributes much of his
             offending to the fact that he became homeless in  2006,  after
             which time his dependence on alcohol escalated.  His  evidence
             however makes it clear  that  he  takes  very  little  if  any
             responsibility for his offending and that  which  he  says  is
             helpful, namely attending meetings for his alcohol  dependency
             does  not  appear  to  have  helped,  as   he   has   offended
             consistently within eighteen months  of  his  arrival  in  the
             United  Kingdom  in  1993,  his  first  offence  having   been
             committed in 1994 until he was imprisoned in 2013.

         58.  I find that I cannot  conclude  from  the  evidence  that  the
             appellant has exercised treaty rights  continuously  for  five
             years, such that he  has  acquired  permanent  residence.   As
             submitted by the respondent's  representative,  the  appellant
             cannot demonstrate such and his offending also calls that into
             question, in that in accordance with the case of  LG  and  CC,
             time spent in prison does not count towards the acquisition of
             the level of years to afford him protection given  to  an  EEA
             national, by Regulation 21(4) of the 2006 EEA Regulations,  or
             to establish him as a person who  has  a  right  of  permanent
             residence in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  mere  fact  of  the
             appellant's presence in  the  United  Kingdom  for  a  lengthy
             period does not entitle him to  permanent  residence  and  the
             evidence is such that  I  cannot  be  satisfied  that  he  has
             resided in accordance with the  2006  EEA  Regulations  for  a
             continuous period of five years, given that as observed by the
             respondent's representative, every  time  he  is  incarcerated
             that resets the clock  insofar  as  the  required  five  years
             continuous residence,  in  accordance  with  the  Regulations.
             Even in respect of the period between 2002 and  2007  when  it
             appears the appellant was not in prison he has no evidence  of
             his exercise of treaty rights in that period, as  on  his  own
             evidence his working life was sporadic on  account  of  having
             been made homeless in  January  2006.   He  is  therefore  not
             eligible for the enhanced protection under Regulation 21(5) of
             the 2006 EEA Regulations.  The decision  to  deport  therefore
             has to be proportionate and based on his  own  conduct,  which
             should present a genuine and sufficiently serious threat.

         59.  The appellant does not accept responsibility for his offending
             and does minimise or blame others for it.  Even that which  he
             claims is helping in rehabilitating him, namely attendance  at
             meetings for his alcohol dependency, does  not  appear  to  be
             assisting   him   and   I   agree   with   the    respondent's
             representative's submission that there is no evidence on which
             I can conclude that the pattern of the appellant's  life  over
             the last twenty years has been broken and that he will  behave
             differently."

8.   That led the judge to a finding that she could not  be  satisfied  that
    the appellant had acquired a permanent right of residence in the United
    Kingdom in accordance with Regulation 15 of the  2006  Regulations  nor
    that she could be satisfied that he had resided in the  United  Kingdom
    for a continuous period of at least ten years in  accordance  with  the
    2006 EEA Regulations such he should  only  be  deported  on  imperative
    grounds of public security.

9.   She concluded applying Regulation 21(5) of the  2006  Regulations  that
    the appellant did, in the light of his long and significant history  of
    previous offences, represent a genuine present and sufficiently serious
    threat affecting the fundamental interests of society so as to  justify
    the decision to deport him to Belgium.  She went  on  to  consider  the
    issues in relation to proportionality and in particular  what  she  had
    been told by the appellant about his previous life in Belgium  and  his
    medical history.  She concluded in relation  to  those  matters  within
    paragraph 63 of the determination as follows:

         "63. The appellant is from Belgium and spent twenty  years  of  his
             life there.  According to his own evidence he has parents  and
             siblings whom albeit not frequently he  is  still  in  contact
             with.  He  stated  at  the  hearing  that  he  has  a  medical
             condition and does not believe that he can access medical help
             in Belgium, having not been in that country for  a  very  long
             time.  I find  however  that  none  of  the  exceptions  under
             paragraph 117C of the 2014 Act, apply to  this  appellant  and
             there is no independent evidence before me  of  his  assertion
             that he will not be able to obtain treatment  for  his  health
             issues in Belgium.  I find given the  appellant's  substantial
             criminal offending, I do not  find  him  credible  and  cannot
             place  reliance  on  his   assertions,   without   independent
             evidence."

10.  She went on to conclude that there would not be a breach of  Article  8
    based on proportionality and in those circumstances that  the  decision
    of the respondent should be upheld.

11.  As we have indicated there were two  bases  upon  which  permission  to
    appeal was granted in this case.  It is important for us  to  emphasise
    that our jurisdiction and our decision is not a full reconsideration of
    the merits of the appellant's appeal.  It  proceeds  on  the  basis  of
    analysing whether or not in the earlier decision there were  errors  of
    law or incidents of unfairness which mean that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

12.  In this case the appeal proceeds on two aspects which  are  related  to
    an allegation of unfairness in respect of the proceedings.   The  first
    of those is that as we have set out above  there  was  misunderstanding
    and confusion in relation to the communication of  the  hearing  and  a
    notification to the appellant in that regard.   The  second,  which  we
    have  also  alluded  to  above,  relates  to  the   absence   of   bail
    documentation before FtTJ Martins which it is said  contained  material
    which might bear upon the issues which she had to consider.

13.  Dealing firstly with the ground in relation to the notification of  the
    hearing, there are two features which in our view are of note.  Firstly
    it was sensible of the Tribunal to  notify  the  prison  at  which  the
    appellant was being held rather than trusting necessarily  to  personal
    communication with the appellant  whilst  he  was  detained.   That  is
    because it is incumbent upon those  who  have  responsibility  for  the
    prison to ensure that he was in attendance at the hearing.

14.   The  second  and  very  important  feature  of  the   case   is   that
    notwithstanding the appellant's confusion  about  whether  or  not  the
    notification of the hearing was  accepted  at  the  prison  it  appears
    beyond argument that the prison authorities and also the appellant were
    aware of the hearing and that the appellant attended and  was  able  to
    take part in the hearing.   Whilst  the  appellant  has  expressed  his
    concern about whether or not he was  fully  prepared  at  the  hearing,
    nonetheless he was present and we  are  satisfied  that  there  was  no
    unfairness in terms of the delivery of the notice and  the  ability  of
    the appellant to attend the hearing in person.

15.  Turning then to the second ground on  which  the  appeal  is  advanced,
    there is the suggestion of unfairness from the appellant on  the  basis
    of the absence of available documentation pertaining in  particular  to
    issues   associated   with   his   employment    and    rehabilitation.
    Additionally, and building upon ground 1, he expressed his concern that
    there may have been other documentation which he  could  have  produced
    and witnesses which may have been available in  support  of  his  case.
    Having carefully scrutinised those suggestions, we are unpersuaded that
    there is substance in them.

16.  Firstly, so far as the  documentation  in  relation  to  employment  is
    concerned it will be clear from both our citation of  paragraph  58  of
    the determination but also as  detected  by  FtTJ  Landes  in  granting
    permission to appeal the precise employment history of the appellant in
    this case was unlikely if not certain to be incapable of assisting  him
    bearing in mind the number of occasions on which he had been imprisoned
    during the course of his time in the United Kingdom  and  therefore  it
    would have made no difference at all to the decision which was  reached
    by the judge.

17.   So  far  as  the  documentation  in  relation  to  rehabilitation  was
    concerned we have been shown documents of a similar nature  during  the
    course of the hearing today.  There is no doubt that that documentation
    and documentation obtained by the appellant at an earlier  stage  speak
    to his credit and  also  his  determination  to  rehabilitate  himself.
    Equally, however, there is no doubt that  the  conclusions  reached  in
    paragraph 59 of the determination about  the  extent  of  the  repeated
    criminal offending of which the appellant has  been  responsible  would
    weigh exceedingly heavily on the other side of  the  balance.   In  the
    circumstances we cannot detect any unfairness in what  occurred.  There
    was little particularity about the nature  of  the  material  that  the
    Appellant would have been able to produce and in any event  bearing  in
    mind the extensive pattern of previous  offending  and  the  inevitable
    heavy weight that that would have carried in the decision which was  to
    be reached on the appeal we are  not  satisfied  that  any  substantive
    unfairness has been made out in this case.

18.  So far as the appellant relies upon medical issues  it  is  clear  from
    paragraph 63 that the judge was alive  to  those  and  took  them  into
    account, but in the absence of independent evidence she was entitled to
    reach the conclusion which she did.  In any event those issues  bearing
    in mind the extensive criminal history which had to be  borne  in  mind
    and would, as we have already observed, carry significant weight in the
    determination of the appeal it is unlikely if not certain that it would
    have made no difference to the outcome of this appeal.

19.  For all of those reasons and  notwithstanding  the  material  which  Mr
    Hebbreecht has put before us this afternoon in support of his appeal we
    are satisfied that there is no error of law in  the  conclusions  which
    were reached  by  FtTJ  Martins  and  therefore  this  appeal  must  be
    dismissed.

Notice of Decision

The appellant's appeal is dismissed on all grounds.
