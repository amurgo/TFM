                                                                    Claimant

Representation:

For the claimant: Mr H Sarwar, instructed by MA Consultants
For the appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Muhammad Amnan, date of birth 8.10.86, is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This  is  the  appeal  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  against  the
    determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Cox  promulgated  15.7.14,
    allowing the claimant's appeal against the decision of the  respondent,
    dated 11.3.13, to refuse his application made  on  21.12.12  for  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as the partner of Qurat Ul-Ain Jamil, a
    British citizen present in the UK.   The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    2.7.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    4.8.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Cox should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    application was refused because the Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied  that  the  claimant  met  the  financial  requirements   and
    specifically that he failed to provide  the  specified  evidence  under
    Appendix FM-SE.

 7. The appeal against the refusal decision was first heard by Judge Sangha
    on 3.12.13, who found  that  the  sponsor  met  the  �18,600  threshold
    requirement for a couple. The Entry Clearance Officer  sought  and  was
    granted permission to appeal that decision on the basis that the appeal
    had been allowed without demonstrating compliance  with  the  mandatory
    specified evidence requirements. The matter then came before the  Upper
    Tribunal and  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Davidge,  who  found  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal in error of law, as no reasons  had
    been given for dispensing with the requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE  by
    reference to paragraph D. Judge Davidge  set  the  decision  aside  and
    remitted it to the First-tier Tribunal, to be decided de novo.  It  was
    then listed before Judge Cox on 2.7.14 and it is Judge  Cox's  decision
    which is the subject matter of this appeal.

 8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Saffer was "satisfied  that  it
    is arguable that there is merit in the grounds for the reasons set  out
    in the application,  and  in  particular  the  failure  to  apply  Ukus
    (discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT 00307 (IAC), which says  that
    in such cases it should not be determined substantively but  should  be
    remitted back to the respondent for failing to exercise discretion."

 9. The missing documentation  justifying  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's
    refusal of the application was: (1) a statement in the letter from  the
    employer confirming the gross annual salary; and (2)  a  personal  bank
    statement matching the period of the wage slips and  showing  that  the
    salary was paid into the  account.  These  are  mandatory  requirements
    under Appendix FM-SE of  the  Immigration  Rules.  Not  only  must  the
    claimant demonstrate that the financial threshold of  �18,600  is  met,
    but it must be proven by specified evidence. In relation to  the  facts
    of this  case,  wage  slips  and/or  a  letter  from  the  employer  is
    insufficient. The employer's  letter  must  contain  certain  specified
    information and the claimant has to show that corresponding deposits in
    the bank statement match the wages shown in the wage slips.

10. In summary, Judge Cox  considered  section  D  of  Appendix  FM-SE  and
    acceded to the submission that D(d)(iii) and (e) applied  and  that  it
    was in the circumstances open to the  Tribunal  to  dispense  with  the
    strict  requirements  of  FM-SE.  The  judge  was  satisfied  that  the
    sponsor's income exceeded  �18,600  and  that  she  had  satisfactorily
    explained why she could  not  produce  a  bank  statement  showing  the
    salary, which was paid in cash, paid into the account. The  judge  also
    found that the missing  information  from  the  employer's  letter  was
    easily identifiable from the wage slips and bank statements.

11. At �15 Judge Cox stated, "I find that the respondent could  and  should
    have applied those provisions and exercised his discretion there  under
    to grant the application. Having  so  found,  and  the  respondent  not
    having considered the exercise of that discretion, I exercise it myself
    and find that the decision was not in accordance with the law  and  the
    Immigration Rules. I find that the appellant and the Sponsor  did  meet
    the financial requirements of Appendix FM  and  that,  no  other  point
    having been taken against them, the appellant was entitled to the entry
    clearance he sought. I therefore allow the appeal under the Immigration
    Rules."

12. The  grounds  of  application  for  permission  to  appeal  point  out,
    correctly, that if the First-tier Tribunal Judge  considered  that  the
    decision of the Entry Clearance Officer was not in accordance with  the
    law by failure to exercise discretion, the correct approach is to allow
    the appeal to  the  limited  extent  that  it  remains  for  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to make a decision that is  in  accordance  with  the
    law. It is submitted that such  an  approach  would  enable  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer  the  opportunity  to  request  alternative  evidence
    and/or to conduct checks as to the veracity  of  the  limited  evidence
    submitted.

13. The second ground of appeal is that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is devoid of adequate reason to support  the  conclusion  that
    the sponsor had provided a valid reason why she could not  or  did  not
    deposit her cash earnings into the bank account.  All  the  judge  said
    about this matter at �14 of the decision was that it had been explained
    in the grounds of appeal and the wages  had  been  shown  on  the  wage
    slips, supported by the employer's letter. With respect to  Judge  Cox,
    the grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal stated only  that  the
    sponsor was paid in cash and does not deposit money into  her  account;
    she contributes the money towards household expenses and the balance is
    kept at home. That is not a valid reason not to comply with the  strict
    requirement that the bank account must show the wages shown on the wage
    slips deposited into the account.

14. However, there is a more serious difficulty with the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal. That is that Judge Cox  purported  to  exercise  a
    discretion the Tribunal did not have.

15. In Ukus, the Upper Tribunal panel pointed out  that  where  a  decision
    maker has failed to exercise a discretion vested in him, the Tribunal's
    jurisdiction on an appeal is limited to a  decision  that  the  failure
    renders the decision 'not in accordance  with  the  law',  pursuant  to
    section 86(3)(a). "Because the discretion is vested in  the  Executive,
    the appropriate course will be for the Tribunal to require the decision
    maker to complete his  task  by  reaching  a  lawful  decision  on  the
    outstanding application." It is clear from D(a) that the discretion  is
    vested entirely in  the  decision-maker,  either  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer or the Secretary of  State.  There  is  no  extension  of  that
    discretion to the Tribunal on appeal. In  other  words,  Judge  Cox  no
    power or authority or power to exercise the discretion on behalf of the
    Entry Clearance Officer and  in  acceding  to  the  submission  of  the
    claimant's representative she misdirected  herself.  For  that  reason,
    quite apart from the other significant failures highlighted above,  the
    decision cannot stand and must be set aside and remade.

16. In remaking the decision in the appeal, I am  wholly  unpersuaded  that
    there was any failure on the part of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    exercise a discretion under section D of Appendix FM-SE to disapply the
    specified evidence requirements. D(a) explains that the Entry Clearance
    Officer will consider the documents submitted with the application  and
    will only consider documents submitted after the application where sub-
    paragraph (b) or (e) applies. Those provisions do  not  apply  in  this
    case. There was no further documentation provided. The letter from  the
    employer was deficient in that it failed to  state,  as  required,  the
    sponsor's gross annual salary. D(c) explains  that  the  decision-maker
    will not request documents where he or she  does  not  anticipate  that
    addressing the error or omission referred to in sub-paragraph (b)  will
    lead to a grant because the  application  will  be  refused  for  other
    reasons. As the sponsor had not  deposited  the  wages  into  the  bank
    account, there was  no  missing  documentation  that  could  have  been
    provided to cure the defect to demonstrate that wages  were  paid  into
    the account. There was no basis for the Entry Clearance Officer to even
    begin to consider exercising  a  discretion  to  either  ask  for  more
    information or alternative verification.

17. It is a matter for the Entry Clearance Officer as to whether there is a
    valid reason as to why a specified document cannot  be  provided.  That
    there may be an explanation as to why wages were not deposited does not
    amount to a reason to dispense  with  the  requirement.  In  Sultana  &
    Others (rules: waiver/further  enquiry;  discretion)  [2014]  UKUT  540
    (IAC), the panel, including the President, held that  where  applicants
    wished to invoke any discretion of the kind covered  by  section  D  of
    Appendix  FM-SE,  "they  should  do  so  when   making   the   relevant
    application, highlighting the specific provision of the  Rules  invoked
    and the grounds upon which the exercise of  discretion  is  requested."
    There was no such request in this case  and  no  basis  for  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to unilaterally exercise  discretion.  The  specified
    evidence requirement therefore stands. Even if the payment is in  cash,
    the applicant has to show that  the  salary  was  paid  into  the  bank
    account. A letter from the employer and/or wage slips  is  insufficient
    to meet the requirement.

18. In the circumstances, I find that there was  no  basis  for  concluding
    that the Entry Clearance Officer had failed to exercise  a  discretion.
    The  application  did  not  meet  the  financial  requirements  and  in
    particular the specified evidence requirements of Appendix  FM-SE.  The
    application as made was doomed to  failure  and  could  not  have  been
    rescued by the application of section D. It  follows  that  the  appeal
    cannot succeed on the Immigration Rules.

   1. No article 8 ECHR issue was raised in the grounds  of  appeal  to  the
      First-tier Tribunal or addressed  in  submissions  at  the  First-tier
      Tribunal appeal hearing. Neither was there any such  issue  raised  by
      the claimant by way of a Rule  24  response  or  in  submissions  made
      before me in the Upper Tribunal. In Sarkar [2014] EWCA  Civ  195,  the
      Court of Appeal held that even when Article 8 is  in  the  grounds  of
      appeal, if  no  evidence  is  adduced  and  no  submissions  made  the
      Appellant can be taken to have abandoned it as a ground of appeal  and
      the  Judge  does  not  err  in  failing  to  deal  with  it.  In   the
      circumstances, I need not address article 8 at all.


Conclusion & Decision:

19. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be  set  aside  and  remade,
    which I did, by dismissing the appeal.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
