Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Emeka Pipi, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant, a national of Algeria, date of birth 24  February  1980,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision dated 28  February  2013  to
    make removal directions under Section 10 of the Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 1999, a form IS.151A having been served on the  same  date  and  an
    asylum/human rights-based claim having been dismissed.

2.   That appeal came before First-tier Tribunal Judge E Grant (the  judge),
    who on 26 July 2013 dismissed the appeal based on paragraph 278B of the
    Immigration Rules and on Article 8 ECHR grounds and no anonymity  order
    was made.

3.   The Appellant appealed against the judge's decision which  was  refused
    by Designated  Immigration  Judge  McClure  on  16  August  2013.   The
    application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal and was again refused  on
    12 September 2013.

4.   By order of Mr Justice Collins, in  judicial  review  proceedings,  the
    Upper Tribunal was directed  to  grant  leave  to  appeal  and  hear  a
    substantive appeal against the order of the First-tier Tribunal  of  26
    July 2013.  Accordingly on 2 September 2014 Mr C  M  G  Ockelton,  Vice
    President of the Upper Tribunal, granted permission in accordance  with
    the decision of the High Court.

5.   With the grant of permission the Respondent on 3 October 2014 put in  a
    response under The Upper Tribunal Procedure Rules Rule 24 opposing  the
    appeal.  The Respondent complained that the Upper  Tribunal's  decision
    did not demonstrate, as Mr  Justice  Collins'  decision  had  also  not
    demonstrated, what was the arguable error of law.

6.   There are no factual issues with the  documents  that  the  judge  took
    into account. It was clearly reasoned why the judge  found  that  there
    was documentary evidence to support the Appellant's claim of continuous
    presence in the United Kingdom for a period  of  nine  years  and  nine
    months running from 2003.  The  judge  also  correctly  identified  the
    three documents being an enrolment letter of 30 January  2003,  a  pass
    certificate in Computing level 2 of 25 March 2003, a  letter  from  the
    London College of Computing and Education Limited dated 23 August 2002,
    an enrolment letter made reference to a deposit paid  on  16  September
    2002 and a  letter  of  15  January  1998  confirming  the  Appellant's
    enrolment on a short English language course with The English  Language
    Consultancy Limited.  The judge also had the material of a letter  from
    a defunct business described as Balham Glass  Works  Limited  dated  16
    July 2002 on a 'to whom it may concern  basis'  and  stating  that  the
    Appellant was employed by the company from November 1997 to  May  2000.
    The letter gives no indication as to what form of employment that took.
     There were also some payslips from Balham Glass Works Limited and from
    a later employer, Raja Tandoori which are undated, said to commence  on
    20 March 2001.

7.   There really was no explanation given to the judge as to how the  early
    period is completely without  any  documentary  evidence  and  yet  the
    period from 2003  and  onwards  is  plainly  supported  by  documentary
    evidence.  In those circumstances the judge was faced with the evidence
    of three of the  Appellant's  friends.   First,  there  was  Mr  Brahim
    Begredj, who considered the Appellant to be his younger brother who  he
    has been accommodating for many years as a family member.  He said that
    he met the Appellant in March or April of 1998  in  the  Finsbury  Park
    area of London in a cafï¿½.  Mr  Kamal  Benamer-Belkacem  speaks  to  the
    period from May 2004 of meeting the Appellant in September and  October
    2004 and their close contact thereafter.

8.   A statement from Mr Djillali Azzout, who is a cousin of  the  Appellant
    and plainly a friend of the Appellant, asserted that the Appellant  has
    lived continuously in the United Kingdom  since  January  1998.   Other
    statements recited by the judge make  reference  to  persons  who  made
    statements knowing the Appellant since 2007 and  2006.   But  one  from
    Djamel Ibesaine asserted that he met the Appellant in 2002 as a friend.

9.   Another, Rachid Belouar, claimed to have known  the  Appellant  in  the
    United Kingdom since sometime in 2000.  Nasser Eddine  Hedjem  referred
    to knowing the Appellant since 1999 as a  friend.   Similarly  Sidahmed
    Khalfa claimed to have known the Appellant in the United Kingdom  since
    2002.  All those persons appear to have known the Appellant in a  false
    identity which he had adopted, namely Farid Zouai, with  the  exception
    of Imran Kalam, who claimed to have known the Appellant in the identity
    he now uses.  The judge did not refer to the letters of  reference  and
    that may have been because having looked at the evidence in  the  round
    and concluded that the live evidence that was called from the witnesses
    was unreliable and that the untested letters did not add any weight  to
    the claim.  I understand  that  none  of  those  persons  attended  the
    hearing to give evidence to support what they had put in writing.

10.  It may also be that the Appellant's own admitted circumstances did  not
    really bring him within the description given in the reference  letters
    of being trustworthy, honest and honourable or a model citizen  of  the
    UK.

11.  Having considered the Record of Proceedings it seems  to  me  that  the
    judge was not under any obligation  to  put  her  misgivings  upon  the
    documentation from the  London  College  of  Computing  and  Education,
    Balham Glass Works, the Raja Tandoori  evidence  or  from  The  English
    Language Consultancy Limited to the Appellant's representatives.

12.  It is also very difficult to see how a limited company as Balham  Glass
    with an employees would not be making deductions for national insurance
    and tax but it seems the gross pay was paid as such without  deduction.
    Similarly the pay advice on the Raja  Tandoori  restaurant  appears  to
    have been made with no tax deducted during the relevant periods.

13.  The judge was  therefore  presented  with  documentation  which  really
    could not be checked and its reliability was open to doubt.

14.  Insofar as the witnesses  called  were  concerned  the  judge  made  no
    adverse comments upon Kamal Benamer-Belkacem, whose evidence covered  a
    period in which the judge had accepted the Appellant was in the  United
    Kingdom.  Therefore he added nothing in the disputed period of 1998  to
    2003.  As a fact the judge was  entitled  to  take  the  view  that  Mr
    Begredj and Mr Azzout had been illegal entrants to the  United  Kingdom
    who had no basis to remain although each of them had later done so on a
    different basis.  Mr Azzout was allowed to  remain,  his  claim  having
    been considered, under the legacy arrangements.  Mr  Begredj,  who  was
    not granted refugee status, stayed on the basis of  marriage  to  a  UK
    national in due course.

15.  I find that the fact that  they  had  known  of  the  Appellant's  true
    identity but had been content to associate with him on a regular  basis
    in the knowledge of him having no lawful status were  matters  to  take
    into account when weighing their honesty and credibility.  It does seem
    to me that the fact that  they  have  made  return  visits  to  Algeria
    without greater knowledge of their claimed  bases  for  seeking  asylum
    really adds little to the matter and perhaps that it  was  of  no  real
    weight.  In considering the grounds of appeal, I note that no complaint
    was made about the absence  of  reference  to  the  letters  that  were
    provided.  It seemed to me that the judge was entitled to give the  un-
    tested references the weight she  thought  appropriate.   As  such  the
    omission of reference to it was not a material error of law.

16.  Therefore on those issues I do not  find  that  the  original  Tribunal
    made any error of law.

17.  There was a  further  ground  of  challenge  relating  to  the  judge's
    consideration of Article 8 of the ECHR.  When the judge was considering
    the matter she was obviously doing so in the context  of  the  evidence
    that did establish that the Appellant had been in  the  United  Kingdom
    since 2003.  The original grounds dated 29 August 2013 did not refer to
    Article 8 as an error of law.  The original grounds to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, which are undated,  simply  refer  to  the  Appellant  having
    established a private and family life which had not been considered  by
    the Secretary of  State.   As  it  happens  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision letter of  28  February  2013  did  address  Article  8  as  a
    consideration arising under the Immigration Rules in respect of private
    life issues.  So far as I  can  tell  no  challenge  was  made  in  the
    original grounds of appeal against that element of the decision.

18.  In the further grounds to the Upper Tribunal, undated but  attached  to
    the application of 6 August 2013, again no issue was raised in relation
    to whether or not  the  Appellant  could  succeed  under  private  life
    provisions within the Immigration  Rules  but  rather  made  a  general
    Article 8 claim.

19.  The premise of much of that claim was based on the assertion  that  the
    Appellant had been in the United Kingdom for fourteen years,  which  of
    course was not established, and on the face of it there was no evidence
    from the Appellant that he has any family life in the United Kingdom as
    contained within his statement other than the passing reference to  his
    being provided with accommodation by his cousin.

20.  It really seems extremely difficult to see what family  life  could  be
    relied upon.  The Appellant's  statement  dated  2  July  2013  at  its
    highest in paragraph 14 referred to the length of time he had  been  in
    the United Kingdom, the fact that he considered the United  Kingdom  as
    his home and was well-integrated into the community  and  that  he  had
    established a private life here.  Again he  relied  upon  some  fifteen
    years continuous presence in the United Kingdom.

21.  It is difficult to see what material there really was  concerning  even
    the extent of private life and the significance of interference in  it.
    The judge found that the Appellant had a private  life  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The judge found Article 8(1) ECHR  rights  were  engaged  and
    properly considered whether or not the decision by the  Respondent  was
    in accordance with the law and properly  served  the  purposes  arising
    under Article 8(2) of  the  ECHR.   The  judge  gave  reasons  why  she
    concluded  that  the  Respondent's  decision  was   proportionate   and
    dismissed the appeal accordingly.  The judge's reasons do not  disclose
    any error of law: This may indeed be why the original grounds of appeal
    to the Tribunal made no reference to them,  settled  as  they  were  by
    Counsel.

22.  In these circumstances I find that the judge made no material error  of
    law in relation to the assessment of the Article  8  ECHR  claim.   The
    original Tribunal's decision stands.
