                                                                  Respondent

For the appellant:        Mr D Aihe, Legal Representative, Wisestep
For the respondent:     Mr P Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. On 1 October 2015  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  McWilliam  dismissed  the
appellant's appeal against a decision dated 11 December  2014  refusing  the
appellant's protection claim. Unbeknown to the judge, the respondent  on  14
January 20015 had in fact withdrawn her decision  and  promised  to  make  a
fresh one. In such circumstances the judge's determination cannot  stand  as
she  had  no  jurisdiction  under  the  Asylum  and   Immigration   Tribunal
(Procedure) Rules 2005 Procedure then in force to determine the appeal.

2. For the above reasons the decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set
aside and I re-make it by concluding that the effect of the withdrawal of
the respondent's decision is that there was (and is no) appeal before the
tribunal.
