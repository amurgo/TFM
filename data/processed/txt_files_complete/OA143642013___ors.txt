Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr R M Ahmed, instructed by Lincoln's Chambers
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens of Bangladesh born on 27th  May  1971,  4th
    March 1995 and 18th May 2000, and they applied for entry  clearance  as
    the partner and children of their sponsor, Mr Mohammed Rashid, on  27th
    February 2013.  Those applications were refused by the Entry  Clearance
    Officer on 13th June 2013 on the basis that the  sponsor's  income  was
    contrived for the purposes of the  application  and  that  the  English
    language documents were not accepted as genuine.

 2. The appeal was determined by First-tier Tribunal Judge A  J  M  Baldwin
    and he refused the appeal.  He  took  into  account  the  documentation
    placed before him which included the respondent's bundle including  the
    applications,  employment  contract,  payslips,  bank  statements   and
    accommodation evidence, and the appellants'  bundle  which  included  a
    skeleton argument, statements, bank statements, employer's  letter  and
    contract, payslips, P60 and tax coding.

 3. He also took into account evidence from HMRC.

 4. An application for permission to appeal  was  submitted  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal stating that the sponsor clearly earned  the  required  funds.
    The Immigration Rules required that  the  sponsor  earned  �24,800  per
    annum and it was submitted that he earned in excess of this in the  six
    months prior to the application which was lodged on 27th February 2013.
     It was submitted that the sponsor's gross income in the relevant  year
    was �24,960 per annum.

 5. It was asserted in the grounds of application for permission to  appeal
    that the judge was concerned at the increase in  the  sponsor's  salary
    and had doubted that the appellant had gone on holiday in Europe.   The
    important question was whether the sponsor's salary or increased salary
    was supported by the proper documentary  evidence  and  this  had  been
    proved  by  the  income  and  concrete  documentary  evidence  such  as
    confirmation from the Inland  Revenue,  P60,  payslips  and  employment
    letter.  The judge had failed to give due weight  to  these  documents,
    which was a material error of  law.   It  was  not  mandatory  for  the
    sponsor to come and give evidence for the hearing.

 6. The employer clearly wrote  a  letter  clarifying  and  confirming  the
    sponsor's employment and presented a P60, payslips and  Inland  Revenue
    letters.

 7. Further issue was taken with the  language  certificate.   The  British
    High Commission suspended all the circumstances issued by  the  City  &
    Guilds for a temporary period and all applicants who  had  passed  from
    City & Guilds were victims.  As a result, following  the  British  High
    Commission's advice, the principal appellant did re-sit  the  test  and
    passed and was issued with certificates.  It was wrong  for  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer to assess the applicant's level  of  English  through
    telephone.

 8. The judge had not taken this into account and it was an error of law.

 9. Further the judge made a speculative finding in paragraph 20 in stating
    that:

         "The fact that the ECO was not sent a copy of the new certificate I
         find it unsafe to conclude that the second certificate is  probably
         genuine, though it may subsequently be found to be."

10.  If  the  judge  had   any   doubt   he   could   have   remitted   the
    matter/certificate to the Entry Clearance  Officer.   The  case  of  DR
    (ECO: post-decision evidence) Morocco* [2005] UKIAT 00038 clearly  sets
    out the law and principles in relation  to  postdecision  evidence  and
    that there was a contrast between "circumstances appertaining"  at  the
    date of decision and "a matter arising" after that date.  The judge was
    wrong not to take this into account.

11. Further it was wrong to state that Article 8 was not  developed  before
    him.   The  skeleton  argument  submitted  in  the  appellants'  bundle
    mentioned various points of Article 8 and supporting case laws and  the
    judge did not make proper findings on Article 8.  Further the judge did
    not apply the five questions in Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

12. The judge should have considered Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL and the family
    unit as a whole.

13. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge White who stated that it  was
    arguable that the judge gave inadequate reasoning for finding that  the
    appellants failed to meet the financial  requirements  given  that  the
    judge stated that the documentary evidence "appears to corroborate" the
    sponsor's claimed income.

14. Secondly it was arguable that in the judge finding that the  appellants
    had not proved that the first English language certificate was  genuine
    at paragraph 20 showed the judge had failed to apply the correct burden
    of proof, see for example RP [2006] UKAIT 00086.

15. Thirdly it was arguable that in regard to the second  English  language
    certificate the judge had  failed  to  take  into  account  the  re-sit
    process referred to in the respondent's undated letter to the applicant
    and the Entry Clearance Manager review of 29th April 2014.

16. It was argued that the judge's reasoning with regard to Article  8  was
    inadequate and did not  address  the  points  raised  in  the  skeleton
    argument contained in the appellants' bundle.

17. At the hearing Mr Ahmed relied on the written grounds for permission to
    appeal and submitted that there was  a  contradictory  finding  in  the
    decision between paragraphs 8 and 19 with regards to what evidence  was
    accepted.  The sponsor had shown income for the relevant tax  year  and
    confirmed in oral evidence that he had recommenced  employment  on  1st
    September 2012.  I was referred to pages 47 and 48 of the  bundle  with
    respect to the HMRC documentation submitted before the judge.

18. With regard to the language course the appellant  had  now  passed  the
    English  language  test.   She  had  made  arrangements  for  a  proper
    assessment and a chance to re-sit  which  the  appellant  did  and  she
    passed.  A new certificate was available from 22nd  March  2013.   This
    evidence should be submitted as per DR (Morocco).

19. Mr Avery submitted that  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  the  judge's
    findings.  He had taken into account the evidence  and  the  judge  was
    entitled to find that he  was  surprised  that  the  employer  was  not
    called.

20. DR (Morocco) did not apply to the language tests which were taken after
    the decision to sit and the appellant could not rely on what was  being
    said.  There  was  no  policy  with  regards  to  a  process  in  these
    particular circumstances.  The judge had  stated  that  the  Article  8
    argument had not been developed.

21. Mr Ahmed responded and stated that Article 8 had  been  raised  in  the
    hearing and in  the  skeleton  argument  submitted  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

Conclusions

22. There are specific requirements under the  Immigration  Rules  for  the
    appellant and sponsor to satisfy and in this case because there was  an
    appellant and two children requesting entry to the UK  and  the  annual
    figure of income which was required was that  of  �24,800.   The  Entry
    Clearance Officer had clearly set out in the reasons for refusal letter
    that the appellant  had  submitted  six  payslips,  corresponding  bank
    statements for the same period and a P60 for 2011 to  2012  showing  he
    earned an annual income of �11,297.  It was stated that the sponsor was
    paid in cash each month and that as of September 2012 his earnings  had
    increased to �20,400 per year.  Previously he had earned �400 per  week
    gross and from 1st September this increased to �480 gross per week.

23. The Entry Clearance Officer  states  that  there  was  no  evidence  in
    relation to the previous wage received prior to September and no reason
    why it would  be  increased  so  significantly.   The  Entry  Clearance
    Officer stated that he noted that the position held by the sponsor  was
    already head  chef  and  thus  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the income had increased as the sponsor had stated.

24. Further the Entry Clearance Officer stated that the documents submitted
    did not reliably demonstrate that she had passed the  English  language
    test as required under the Immigration Rules.

25. The judge clearly set out the evidence he considered under paragraph  8
    which stated:

         "In relation to  the  sponsor's  income,  payslips,  an  employment
         contract and bank statements were provided with  the  applications.
         They appear to corroborate  the  claim  that  the  sponsor's  gross
         income was �24,960 per annum."

26. The judge  also  recorded  that  the  first  payment  of  �2,080  gross
    (�1,625.44 net) was stated to be earned from September 2012.

27. The judge then  recorded  that  the  appellant  had  earned  a  sum  of
    �11,297.45 from the same employer the previous year.   The  judge  also
    set out the letter from the employer dated 28th August 2012  confirming
    that his salary increase would be from 1st September 2012 at a rate  of
    �480.

28. The judge also noted that the contract with  effect  from  1st  October
    2011, that is the previous year, recorded the sponsor as being the head
    chef and showed his salary as �20,800.

29. The judge at paragraph 8 did not accept the evidence  but  stated  that
    the evidence merely appeared to corroborate the appellants' case.   The
    judge did not set out that the evidence of the employer  was  mandatory
    of the Immigration Rules but merely stated quite correctly that bearing
    in mind that the sponsor had known for over ten months that there was a
    challenge to the income that the oral evidence of  the  employer  might
    have been helpful.

30. However, the judge at paragraph 10  of  his  determination  noted  that
    revenue records recorded the sponsor as starting his present employment
    on 1st August 2012 and earning �16,640 in the tax year  2012  to  2013.
    The P60 recorded a gross pay of �24,960 in the tax year 2013 to 2014.

31. The judge clearly shows in paragraph 11 that he had asked  the  sponsor
    why he had only earned a total of �16,640 in 2012/13 if he  worked  for
    the same employer in the same job and found that the appellant  changed
    his evidence and did not give adequate responses.  At first stated that
    he had gone abroad but could not  produce  the  passport  to  show  the
    stamps and then stated that he had not returned from  Bangladesh  until
    13th July 2011 and that  he  had  started  work  again  with  the  same
    employer in September 2012.  He then stated that he did  not  work  for
    the employer between April and July but started  again  on  1st  August
    2012.  He was asked how it was that his salary in August 2012, that  is
    before it was said to have increased, was the same as  it  was  on  1st
    September 2012, and he stated that he had worked extra hours and he had
    left his job for several months because they  would  not  increase  his
    salary and he instead travelled around Europe.  The  sponsor,  I  note,
    did not state that he was paid in arrears but that he did extra  hours.
    In addition the judge found that overtime did not feature in  a  single
    of the pay slips provided for  subsequent  months.  Thus  even  if  the
    sponsor was paid in arrears and I stress, this  was  not  the  evidence
    given, the judge still did not accept that his salary would  have  gone
    up so significantly when he was in the same role as head  chef  working
    for the same employer.  The judge found at [11] that 'he had worked  in
    the same capacity since 1st October 2011 and clearly did not accept the
    evidence from the employer letter and P60 and payslip in  the  face  of
    the HMRC documentation.

32. Although the evidence of the sponsor was recorded the judge clearly did
    not accept it and his findings are set out at paragraph 19.  The  judge
    reviewed the evidence comprehensively and set out the challenges to the
    evidence that the appellant had produced.  The judge took into  account
    the fact that the sponsor in the oral hearing was "less than  clear  in
    his answers" and that he become more and more unclear [19].  The  judge
    recorded the fact that the appellant claimed he had gone on holiday  in
    Europe in the summer of 2012 but was unable to produce stamps in either
    passport for 2012 [11].

33. The judge also doubted the sponsor's evidence because the  hearing  was
    the first time he had ever made mention of  leaving  India  Limited  in
    favour of touring Europe for several months and not working  with  them
    in March to July inclusive [19].

34. The judge did not accept this on the basis  that  he  found  it  highly
    improbable that with a wife and three children in Bangladesh  he  would
    choose to tour Europe  rather  than  continue  working  in  the  UK  or
    spending time in Bangladesh.

35. Also the judge found that his claim that his pay in August 2012 was the
    same as it was in September when his salary was supposed to  have  gone
    up by 20% was "highly unlikely" as it was not evidenced by a payslip or
    a bank statement for August 2012.

36. The judge did not accept  the  sponsor's  explanation  that  there  was
    overtime.  The judge was aware that the income claimed for 2011 to 2012
    was in fact �16,640.  This is evidence produced by the HMRC and is  the
    most reliable evidence and the evidence from  the  HMRC  was  that  the
    appellant only earned that lower amount in the relevant tax  year  2012
    to 2013 and in the period relevant for the appeal.  The sponsor's claim
    that this increased in the following year just did  not  withstand  the
    judge's scrutiny not least because of the shifting oral evidence of the
    appellant's sponsor.

37. In sum the judge found that the appellant had  failed  to  clarify  the
    maintenance issue raised by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  and  rather
    "cast a shadow over the issue".

38. It was open to the judge to find that the evidence was  unreliable  and
    he clearly did so.

39. I find no error of law in respect to the judge's treatment of  evidence
    regarding maintenance.

40. The Entry Clearance Officer submitted a letter from City & Guilds dated
    20th May 2013 and this was available at the First-tier Tribunal hearing
    to  the  effect  that  all  certificates  relating  to  an  examination
    conducted in Bangladesh with an issue date prior to  1st  October  2012
    would not be accepted  as  evidence  of  a  pass  in  English  language
    proficiency for visa applications.  I can accept  that  the  burden  of
    proof is initially on the respondent to show that  the  document  is  a
    forgery but in fact the City & Guilds  letter  shows  that  there  were
    irregularities in the  conduct  of  English  language  examinations  in
    Bangladesh.  Thus the burden may shift to the appellant and thus  I  do
    not accept that the judge used the wrong burden or standard of proof in
    respect of the language certificate as he stated: "In the light of  the
    interview record answers and the other information provided by the  ECO
    I find that  the  appellants  have  not  proved  that  it  is  probably
    genuine."  As the judge stated, she provided  had  another  certificate
    which related to a date ten  months  after  the  decision.   The  judge
    recorded that the Entry Clearance Officer was not sent a  copy  of  the
    new certificate.  What is clear is that the  appellant  had  taken  the
    second examination prior to the Entry Clearance Manager review  but  no
    certificate had even  been  submitted  prior  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager review ten months later.

41. I was asked to consider DR (Morocco)  in  this  respect  but  taking  a
    language test ten  months  later  does  not  demonstrate  circumstances
    appertaining at the time, and that indeed I find is  a  matter  arising
    after that date.  The appellant had not attempted to submit  a  further
    certificate prior to the Entry Clearance Manager's review which was ten
    months after the decision.

42. The fact is that the appellants could not comply with  the  Immigration
    Rules with respect to maintenance and  the  judge's  findings  in  this
    respect contained no material error of law and any further issue  under
    the language certificate could not make a difference.

43. The judge was clear in relation to Article 8 that it was raised in  the
    grounds of appeal and he did make findings not least that there are  in
    fact three children of this couple and one of them aged 16 who would be
    left behind in Bangladesh whilst her mother and two siblings  moved  to
    the UK.  He stated: "One cannot look at the best interests  of  two  of
    the sponsor's children in isolation from their sister."

44. Further Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC)

    Where an area of the rules does not have such an express mechanism, the
    approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) ([29]-[31] in particular) and Gulshan  (Article
    8 - new Rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  640  (IAC)  should  be
    followed: i.e. after applying the requirements of the  rules,  only  if
    there may be arguably good grounds for granting leave to remain outside
    them is it necessary for Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether there are compelling circumstances not sufficiently  recognised
    under them.

45. The judge considered the Immigration Rules and found that there was "no
    good arguable case has been  made  out  under  Article  8  outside  the
    Rules".

46. The judge was entitled to make this finding and  although  his  reasons
    may be brief further to Shizad  (sufficiency  of  reasons:  set  aside)
    [2013] UKUT 00085 (IAC) I find that they are adequate bearing  in  mind
    the judge has had regard to the evidence.  In essence the  judge  found
    that the appellants could not comply with the maintenance requirements.
     R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985  is  proposition  that  the
    maintenance requirements under the Immigration Rules are necessary  and
    lawful and not  incapable  of  being  applied  in  a  manner  which  is
    proportionate or  justifiable  and  that  within  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules the best interests of the child have been considered.

47. On an overall reading of this determination there is no  error  of  law
    and it shall stand.
