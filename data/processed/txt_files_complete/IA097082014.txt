                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Ghani, promulgated on 14th August 2014, following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 29th July 2014.  In the determination,  the
    judge dismissed the appeal of Mrs Mandeep Kaur  Sidhu.   The  Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of India,  who  was  born  on  7th
    January 1982.  She appeals  against  the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 13th February 2014, refusing  her  application
    for a derivative residence card on the basis of  Regulation  15A(7)  of
    the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006.  She  relies
    upon the case of Ruiz Zambrano.  Her case is that she  is  the  primary
    carer under Regulation 15A(7) of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2006, and she relies upon the  well-established  case
    of Ruiz Zambrano  (C-34/09).   Her  daughter,  on  whom  she  exercises
    primary care, is Pratibha Sarin, and she is a British  citizen,  having
    acquired her British nationality from her father, Sanjay Sarin, who  is
    married to the Appellant.  Sanjay Sarin is employed but does  not  earn
    enough to meet the �18,600 financial threshold, such  as  would  enable
    the Appellant, who is not a British citizen, to remain in the  UK  with
    her husband and child.  Therefore, the Appellant relies upon Regulation
    15A(7).

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that she entered the UK in September 2009 as a
    student.  She met Sanjay Sarin a year later in 2010.   They  started  a
    relationship.  They began living together in  2012.   On  12th  January
    2013, a daughter was born to them, Pratibha  Sarin,  and  this  was  in
    Leicester.  She, the  Appellant,  became  her  primary  carer,  as  her
    mother.  The child's father, Sanjay Sarin, could not be a primary carer
    because he was out at work.  Since  Sanjay  Sarin  does  not  earn  the
    requisite amount to enable the Appellant to succeed as a  spouse  under
    the Immigration Rules, the Appellant will have to return to India.  She
    would have to consider making an application from India.  Her  husband,
    Sanjay Sarin, would then have to give up his  job,  in  order  to  look
    after their daughter, Pratibha Sarin and he would then become dependent
    on public funds.  He cannot leave the United Kingdom  to  go  to  India
    because he is settled here.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge held that the Appellant could not meet the requirements for a
    derivative right of residence under the case of Ruiz  Zambrano  because
    the Appellant shared equally the responsibility for her child with  her
    partner who was an exempt person because he  was  a  British  national.
    The judge held that Mrs Sarin's mother lived with the Appellant and,

         "There is no reason why the child cannot remain in the UK  and  the
         grandmother could look after the child  if  the  Appellant  had  to
         return  in  order  to  make  a  proper  application  as  a  spouse.
         Furthermore, Mr Sarin works at different times and  therefore  that
         would give him time to be with the child." (Paragraph 9)

 5. The judge went on to consider Article 8, but held that as the Appellant
    could not meet the financial threshold  requirement  for  a  spouse  of
    �18,600 under the Rules, to enable her to succeed under Article 8 would
    be to circumvent the Immigration Rules (paragraph 10).  The judge  also
    considered the "best interests of the child" under

 6. Section 55 of the BCIA 2009 and held that as a  young  child  the  best
    interests of Pratibha Sarin was to be with her mother but that,  "there
    would be a temporary separation between the father and  the  child  and
    such temporary separation will not make the decision  disproportionate"
    (paragraph 11).

 7. In considering the issue of "proportionality" the judge held that,

         "The current case law seems to suggest that only if  there  may  be
         arguably good grounds for granting  leave  to  remain  outside  the
         Immigration Rules [is] it necessary for Article 8 purposes to go on
         to  consider  that   there   are   compelling   circumstances   not
         sufficiently recognised under them.   The  Appellant  has  her  own
         family in India.  Apart from the child who is of course very young,
         no other  compelling  circumstances  have  been  put  forward  ..."
         (Paragraph 11)

    The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that the determination was  flawed  in
    this analysis of Article 8 and the question of how proportionality  was
    to be examined.

 9. On 22nd September 2014, permission to appeal was  granted  robustly  on
    the basis that the judge had failed to have regard to  Section  117B(6)
    of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which now  codified
    through statute the relevant principles of Article 8.

Submissions

10. At the hearing before me on 9th January 2015,  Mr  Ruparelia  submitted
    two additional documents before me.  First, there was a letter from the
    University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust dated  10th  December  2014
    confirming that Mr Sanjay Sarin had been admitted with chest  pain  and
    ST elevation in the inferior and posterior leads.  He  had  since  been
    discharged home with routine advice.  He worked as an  HGV  driver  and
    has been advised to inform the DVLA that he  will  not  be  allowed  to
    drive until he has had his ETT  (requested).   Mr  Ruparelia  submitted
    that this showed that the Appellant's husband, Mr Sanjay Sarin, was not
    now able to work.

11. Second, he submitted a skeleton argument with respect to Article 8  and
    EX1, together with a reference to Section 117B of the  Immigration  Act
    2014.  Otherwise, he submitted that he would rely upon the  Grounds  of
    Appeal and the manner in which the permission had been granted  by  the
    Tribunal on 22nd September 2014.

12. For his part, Mr Smart relied upon  the  Rule  24  response  dated  1st
    October 2014.  It is said that the  grounds  complain  that  the  judge
    adopted the  wrong  test  of  "compelling  circumstances"  rather  than
    "arguably good grounds", but this was entirely wrong because  the  test
    in Nagre and Gulshan was clear that only if  there  are  arguably  good
    grounds for granting leave should one consider freestanding  Article  8
    jurisprudence on the basis that there are compelling circumstances  not
    sufficiently recognised under the Immigration Rules.  It was true  that
    the judge did not set out the whole  test  but  he  was  aware  of  the
    relevant cases. At paragraph 11 the  judge  found  that  the  temporary
    separation between the father and the child whilst the  mother  applied
    for entry clearance, and although the judge did not explicitly consider
    EX1, it is clear that the judge did not consider  it  unreasonable  for
    the child to leave the UK.

13. Mr Smart submitted that there  was  here  a  refusal  of  a  derivative
    residence card.  The right to  a  derivative  residence  card  was  not
    recognised.  The refusal letter was clear (see page 3 of 5) that,

         "Since you  have  not  made  a  valid  application  for  Article  8
         consideration, consideration has not been given as to whether  your
         removal from the UK would  breach  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.   ...
         Additionally, it is pointed out that a  decision  not  to  issue  a
         derivative residence card does not require you to leave the  United
         Kingdom if you can otherwise demonstrate that you have a  right  to
         reside under the Regulations."

14. Mr Smart submitted that this is as far as it went.   The  consideration
    of the claim did not go into a consideration of Article 8.  It  stopped
    at a consideration of  a  derivative  residence  card.   To  this,  the
    Appellant was not entitled.   The  application  was  for  a  derivative
    residence card.  It was rejected.  It ended there.

15. There was no need to consider matters relating to the child, especially
    in circumstances that both the grandmother and the father of the  child
    could look after Pratibha Sarin.  There was also no need for the  judge
    to go into EX1 because the application was not  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.

16. In reply, Mr Ruparelia submitted that  the  application  for  leave  to
    remain must  be  considered  as  a  whole.   He  relied  upon  Omotunde
    (Nigeria) [2011] UKUT 00247, which also concerned  the  application  of
    the Ruiz Zambrano principles, but where  the  Tribunal  held  that  the
    assessment questions set  out  in  Razgar  [2004]  UKHL  27  should  be
    tailored,  placing  the  assessment  of   necessity   where   it   most
    appropriately belongs in the final question dependent on the outcome of
    proportionality and  a  fair  balance,  rather  than  as  part  of  the
    identification of the legitimate aim.  Furthermore, Section 117B of the
    2014 Act had not been considered.

Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should  set  aside  the  decision.   The  fundamental
    reason for this is, as the grant of permission on 22nd  September  2014
    stipulates, the failure of the judge to consider Section  117B  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014 (and not the NIAA 2002  as  the  grant  suggests).
    The judge had held (at paragraph 9) that there was no  reason  why  the
    Appellant's British child "cannot remain in the UK and the  grandmother
    could look after the child if the Appellant had to return in  order  to
    make a proper application as a spouse".  However, Section 117B(6) makes
    it clear, that there is an additional requirement of whether "it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom".

18. The judge had already accepted that  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom (because the  judge  found
    that the child could remain in the UK with the grandmother  whilst  the
    Appellant made her application from abroad), so  if  the  principle  in
    Section 117B(6) had been applied,  it  is  arguable  that  a  different
    outcome to the appeal would have been achieved.

19. Second, the case law has moved on from Nagre and from Gulshan and it is
    clear now that there is no "threshold requirement" which has to be  met
    before a consideration of Article 8 rights under the Immigration  Rules
    can be abandoned in favour of  freestanding  Article  8  jurisprudence.
    The matter has to be looked at as  a  composite  whole,  especially  in
    cases where the Rules are not a complete code.  In particular,  matters
    will now have to be assessed on the basis of cases such as  Ganesabalan
    [2014] EWHC 2712 and Oludoyi [2014] UKUT 00539.



Notice of Decision




20. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I remake the decision as follows.

21. This appeal is to be remitted back to a First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court other than Judge Ghani  to  be  determined  de
    novo on the basis of the application of both Section 117B of  the  2014
    Act and on the basis  of  the  latest  jurisprudence  with  respect  to
    Article 8 identified above.  A  careful  assessment  will  have  to  be
    undertaken on the basis of the evidence.  This  matter  is  appropriate
    for  remittal  under  Section  7.2  of  the  Upper  Tribunal   Practice
    Statement.  The appeal is allowed to that extent.

22. No anonymity order is made.
