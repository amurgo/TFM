For the Appellant:           Mr P Duffy (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)
For the Respondent:        Mr J Rene (counsel instructed by Queen's Park
Solicitors)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeals of Helen [A], a  citizen
       of Nigeria, against the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal to allow
       the appeals of Mrs [A] and of  her  four  dependent  children:  [ASA]
       (born [ ] 2003), [ESA] (born [ ] 2005), [AA] (born [ ] 2007) and [EA]
       (born [ ] 2009).


    2. The refusal letter states that the family entered the United  Kingdom
       on 6 October 2009, save for [EA] who was born in this country.  Their
       applications were refused on the  basis  that  the  Rules  addressing
       private and family life were not satisfied: the mother could not show
       very significant obstacles to her integration in Nigeria, none of the
       children had resided in the  UK  for  seven  years  at  the  date  of
       decision, and the children did not assist  their  mother  to  qualify
       under the "parent" route under Appendix FM as  there  was  no  parent
       with limited leave under Appendix FM or indefinite  leave  to  remain
       upon whom such an application could found. There were no  exceptional
       circumstances justifying the grant  of  leave  given  the  childrens'
       circumstances: they were to be removed with their  mother  who  could
       help them to readapt to life abroad, they were nationals of  Nigeria,
       the elder children had lived in Nigeria for their  early  years,  and
       were not yet studying towards a recognised qualification. The  mother
       would be able to live lawfully in Nigeria where she  would  have  the
       legal right to work, and could rely on extended family for support.


    3. In its decision of 24 March 2017, the  First-tier  Tribunal  set  out
       further  information  regarding  the  family's   circumstances.   The
       childrens'  father,  Mrs  [A]'s  husband,  had  been   convicted   of
       assaulting a child aged under twelve years in 2015 and was  sentenced
       to  six  years'  imprisonment;  once  his  sentence  ended  he  faced
       deportation to Nigeria. Accordingly Mrs [A] did not wish the children
       to have any contact with him until they were older. She had completed
       a degree in Business Management in Nigeria, and a  Masters  in  Human
       Resources in  the  United  Kingdom;  she  volunteered  at  the  local
       Citizens Advice Bureau here.  She thought it would  be  difficult  to
       find work for herself there.


    4. The First-tier  Tribunal  first  considered  the  appeals  under  the
       Immigration Rules. It found there were no  significant  obstacles  to
       the mother's integration in Nigeria, as she was healthy and could  be
       expected to find work, and clearly had  skills  and  experience  that
       would help her make a living there, even though  life  might  not  be
       easy. She had social, cultural and family ties to the  country.   The
       Rules did not cater for the situation of the children. However, there
       were compelling reasons to consider their  cases  outside  the  Rules
       given the strength of their ties in this country, and as they had all
       lived in the UK for seven years by the date of the  hearing,  section
       117B(6) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was highly
       relevant to the outcome of the appeal.


    5. The whole family were actively  involved  in  their  church  and  had
       established community ties. Each  child  had  established  sufficient
       ties outside the family unit, in church and school, to amount  to  an
       independent private life of  their  own.  The  eldest  child  already
       attended boarding school. Having regard to the section 117B  factors,
       they were proficient in the English language and were established  as
       financially  independent,  given  the  evidence   to   that   effect:
       accordingly these factors did not count  against  them,  albeit  they
       were otherwise neutral in the balancing exercise.


    6. The First-tier Tribunal went  on  to  look  at  the  quality  of  the
       mother's residence and whether it was  precarious,  noting  that  the
       family unit had been resident in a category of the Rules that led  to
       settlement. They accordingly had an expectation, in  a  broad  rather
       than a public law "legitimate" sense, that they need  not  intend  to
       leave the country at the end of their residence.  The  Tribunal  also
       noted that despite the length  of  residence  of  the  children,  the
       Secretary of State had not  taken  their  wishes  into  account  when
       considering the applications.


    7. Having  regard  to  those  considerations,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       evaluated the  question  of  the  reasonableness  of  the  childrens'
       relocation abroad. The mother would be returning  as  a  lone  parent
       with four children to care for; whilst she might be able to count  on
       some familial support,  she  had  primary  responsibility  for  their
       welfare,  in  circumstances  where  they  would  all  be  foreseeably
       suffering significant disruption from  the  loss  of  their  friends,
       school and home. Having regard to the considerations identified in MA
       (Pakistan), including the fact that seven years'  residence  of  non-
       British citizen  children had to be given significant weight  in  the
       proportionality balance having regard  to  the  likelihood  of  their
       having put down roots over that period, and to the fact that three of
       the children had been resident for seven years after the age of  four
       and thus at a time when they were particularly likely to be beginning
       to develop private lives of their own, it could not be said that  the
       public interest mandated their exclusion.


    8. Grounds of appeal from the Secretary  of  State  submitted  that  the
       considerations identified in section 117A-D had not been  considered,
       in either substance of form.


    9. A judge of the First-tier Tribunal granted permission to appeal on 27
       September 2017 on the basis that the judge's reasoning was "silent on
       section 117B".


Findings and reasons


   10. Unsurprisingly, Mr Duffy showed some reticence in pressing the appeal
       of the Secretary of  State.  The  most  cursory  examination  of  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal demonstrates that section 117B of
       the NIAA 2002 was specifically cited in  the  part  of  the  decision
       below that contains the Tribunal's material reasoning.  Each  of  its
       relevant constituents is plainly assessed and identified over several
       closely reasoned paragraphs.  It is very hard to see how  any  person
       who had read the decision could possibly  think  otherwise,  and  one
       fears that the First-tier  Tribunal  granting  permission  to  appeal
       simply acted on the Secretary of State's grounds  of  appeal  without
       checking  whether  the  decision  impugned  actually  contained   the
       asserted errors.


   11. The First-tier Tribunal records  that  it  was  undisputed  that  the
       family was financially independent. The mother and children all spoke
       English. So those factors did not count against them  when  assessing
       the public interest under sub-sections 117B(2) and (3). They were not
       resident unlawfully, so  section  117B(4)  was  not  in  play.  Their
       residence had to be evaluated for any precarious  quality:  this  was
       addressed in detail, the judge  noting  that  they  had  always  been
       present lawfully, within a settlement route. Given the requirement to
       assess precariousness on an "evaluative" basis, as observed by  Sales
       LJ in Rhuppiah [2016] EWCA Civ 803, and the need to bear in mind  all
       relevant circumstances as identified by Lord Reed in  Agyarko  [2017]
       UKSC 11 ï¿½53, the closely reasoned decision of the First-tier Tribunal
       can be seen to be fully in accordance with the governing authorities.




   12. It is necessary for the Tribunal to express its  extreme  disapproval
       of the grounds of appeal in this case. They asserted  in  unequivocal
       terms that consideration of section 117B of the NIAA 2002 was  absent
       from the decision. This was simply untrue.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
       was seriously misled when it  granted  permission  to  appeal.  As  a
       result, the time and  resources  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  have  been
       unnecessarily expended. The Respondents have been put to  unjustified
       expense.

Award of costs

   13. It is against  this  backdrop  that  the  Respondents  have  made  an
       application for a costs order on  account  of  the  approach  to  the
       litigation taken by the Secretary of State,  which  they  argued  was
       unreasonable. They gave notice in writing of this intention  via  the
       Rule 24 notice submitted on 24  October  2017,  citing  the  relevant
       authorities. Mr Duffy had not appreciated this application  had  been
       made, although it appears to have been sent to the Secretary of State
       and  is  present  on  the  Upper  Tribunal  correspondence  file.  He
       nevertheless dealt with it, arguing that  the  conduct  of  the  Home
       Office draftsperson had been in good faith and should not be  treated
       as "unreasonable".


   14. The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 provide:

           "Orders for costs(a)


           10.-(1)     The Upper Tribunal may not make an order in respect
           of costs ... except-


           ...


                    (d)      if the Upper Tribunal considers that a party or
                    its representative has acted unreasonably in bringing,
                    defending or conducting the proceedings;


                (5)    A person making an application for an order for costs
                or expenses must-


                    (a)      send or deliver a written application to the
                    Upper Tribunal and to the person against whom it is
                    proposed that the order be made;"

   15. In Ridehalgh v Horsefield [1994] Ch 205, the Court of Appeal stated:

           "... unreasonable also means what it has been understood to mean
           in this context for at least  half  a  century.  The  expression
           aptly describes conduct which is vexatious, designed  to  harass
           the other side rather than advance the resolution  of  the  case
           and it makes no difference that the conduct is  the  product  of
           excessive zeal and not improper motive. But  conduct  cannot  be
           described as unreasonable simply because it leads in  the  event
           to an unsuccessful result or because other more  cautious  legal
           representatives would have acted differently. The acid  test  is
           whether the conduct permits of a reasonable explanation. If  so,
           the  course  adopted  may  be  regarded  as  optimistic  and  as
           reflecting  on  a  practitioner's  judgment,  but  it   is   not
           unreasonable ..."

   16. I find that on the facts of this case, the  Secretary  of  State  has
       acted unreasonably. Active misrepresentation of the  contents  of  an
       appealed decision goes far beyond legitimate written advocacy and can
       properly be considered vexatious. It cannot be equated  to  pleadings
       which are unduly  optimistic.   As  explained  in  Ridehalgh,  it  is
       unnecessary to determine the motive of the draftsperson, and  whether
       they were driven merely by "excessive zeal" or not.  Unfortunately, a
       serious  misrepresentation  of  fact  was  made,  and  no  reasonable
       explanation has been offered for the conduct of the  draftsperson  of
       the grounds of appeal. The  Secretary  of  State's  systems  as  they
       operated in this particular case plainly did not extend to  reviewing
       the arguability of the grounds before the hearing or  to  making  any
       enquiries as to why such unsatisfactory arguments  should  have  been
       advanced.


   17. None of this is any reflection upon the conduct of  Mr  Duffy  before
       me; it is to his credit  that  he  expended  no  more  of  the  Upper
       Tribunal's time than was minimally necessary to address the substance
       of the grounds and to briefly defend the grounds of appeal as falling
       within the bounds of reasonable litigation rather  than  constituting
       unreasonable conduct. However, I was unpersuaded by  his  submissions
       for the reasons already stated.


   18. I accordingly find it is  appropriate  to  award  costs  against  the
       Secretary of State. That is my finding on liability  for  costs.  The
       quantum remains to be determined.




    Decision:

    The appeal of the Secretary of State is dismissed.


    The Secretary of State is to pay the Respondent's  costs  in  defending
    this appeal, the amount of costs to be  determined  in  line  with  the
    Directions below.


    Directions:


    The Respondent's representatives have  produced  a  schedule  of  costs
    incurred in defending the appeal; these have been sent to the Secretary
    of State and to the Upper Tribunal. As that schedule was not  available
    at the hearing, it is appropriate to give the Secretary  of  State  the
    opportunity to make representations as to the extent of costs for which
    she is said to be liable.


      1) The Secretary of State is to make  written  submissions  within  14
         days of the date that this decision is sent to her.


      2) The Respondent may then have 7 days from the date those submissions
         are sent to her representatives to respond to those submissions.


      3) The Upper Tribunal will then make a summary assessment of the costs
         based on the material before it.


 Signed:                                           Date: 15 February 2018
