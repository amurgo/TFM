                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge David Page and a lay member), sitting at Newport on  16
    July, to  a deportation  appeal by a Kurdish citizen of  Iran,  born  1
    December 1985. The appeal turns on whether the panel were justified  in
    refusing a request for an adjournment for a report to  be  commissioned
    from a 'country expert', and in their  approach  to  Devaseelan  [2002]
    UKIAT 00702*; so first we shall need to say something about the history
    of these proceedings.

 2. The appellant had clandestinely arrived in this  country  on  about  16
    September 2005, claiming asylum on the 22nd: his claim was based on his
    having been approached by the Iranian security forces to act as  a  spy
    for them, and the likely consequences of his  refusal  to  do  so.  His
    first appeal, against refusal of asylum, was dismissed by Judge Stephen
    Hall on 26 January 2006, and came finally to an  end  with  refusal  of
    reconsideration of that decision by a senior immigration  judge  on  20
    February that year. The appellant  did  not  leave  this  country,  but
    stayed on till he was  given  indefinite  leave  to  remain,  for  what
    reasons the grant leaves unclear, on 17 September 2010.

 3. In early November  2010  the  appellant  committed  three  offences  of
    conversion or possession of criminal property, for which on 26  October
    2011 he was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment, concurrently on each.
    That led to a notice from the Home Office, inviting him to say  why  an
    order for his deportation should not automatically follow, to which  he
    responded on 9 December 2011,  repeating  his  previous  asylum  claim,
    without any apparent fresh material to support it. A deportation  order
    followed on 28 May 2013, posted  with  a  decision  letter  giving  the
    reasons for it to his solicitors on 2 June, and  personally  served  on
    him on the 5th. The letter referred to the appellant's  reassertion  of
    his asylum claim, and to its having been dismissed on appeal in January
    2006.

 4.  The  appellant  appealed  through  his  very  experienced   specialist
    solicitors on 17 June: the grounds referred in  general  terms  to  the
    appellant's rights under the Refugee Convention, but  gave  no  further
    details. The solicitors' covering letter referred, apparently in  their
    standard terms, to the need to list  their  firm's  London  appeals  at
    Taylor House, rather than Hatton Cross. This appellant,  as  they  knew
    however, had since his release on immigration bail on 2 April 2012 been
    living in Bristol, so that, in accordance  with  the  usual  procedure,
    his appeal was not  listed  for  hearing  in  London,  but  in  Newport
    (Gwent).

 5. On 25 June 2013 the appellant and his solicitors were  sent  by  first-
    class post notice of hearing at Newport on 16 July. The solicitors  did
    not reply to that till Friday 12 July at 1506, when they faxed a letter
    to that centre, complaining that

            a) they had only just received the Home Office bundle  for  the
               appeal, missing some pages, which they listed;

            b) they had not yet  received  a  reply  from  the  appellant's
               former probation officer to questions they had  asked  about
               him; and

            c) since the appellant had  been  unrepresented  at  his  first
               appeal, they wanted to submit  further  evidence,  which  at
               this stage they did not specify;

    and asking for the appeal hearing either to be  transferred  to  Taylor
    House for a pre-hearing review, or  to  be  converted  into  a  similar
    hearing at Newport, so that appropriate directions could be  given.  No
    point was taken before us on (b), and the panel in  any  case  accepted
    that this appellant had been assessed as presenting low  risks  of  re-
    offending, and of harm to the public, and had behaved well  in  prison,
    leading  to  his  being  given  'enhamced  status'  while  there.  That
    application was refused by a judge and the solicitors were told of  the
    refusal on Monday 15 July.

 6. On 16 July, the day of the hearing itself,  the  solicitors  faxed  the
    hearing centre again, saying their counsel would  be  applying  to  the
    hearing judge for an adjournment: the relevant part of this application
    referred to an attached e-mail of the 15th  from  Mrs  Anna  Enayat,  a
    'country expert' well known to this Tribunal, where she says

        I am able to write a report on the issues you have raised but  owing
       to the complexity of some, coupled with travel plans in August, I  am
       unable to meet a deadline until early September.

       The report will  need  to  cover  the  background  to  your  client's
       original appeal, which was not explored at the time,  taking  in  the
       use  of  informers  among  the  Kurdish  population  by  the  Iranian
       authorities, the reasons why an inhabitant of the particular  village
       he came from would have been of particular value to them, as well  as
       certain cultural issues that were not taken account of  in  his  2006
       hearing.

 7. The solicitors added, though this did not appear  in  Mrs  Enayat's  e-
    mail, that she had

       ... confirmed that she would  be  able  to  comment  on  the  Iranian
       authorities' likely adverse interest in the appellant on  account  of
       his criminal conviction and the likely consequences of this in  terms
       of interrogation, detention and any ill-treatment. This is plainly  a
       new issue which did not arise before the Tribunal in the  appellant's
       original appeal.

 8. The application was repeated  by  counsel  at  the  hearing  (not  Miss
    Short), and the one involving Mrs Enayat's evidence was dealt  with  by
    the panel at paragraph  22,  after  referring  to  r.  21  (2)  of  the
    Procedure Rules, which provides that

       The Tribunal  must  not  adjourn  a  hearing  of  an  appeal  on  the
       application of a party,  unless  satisfied  that  the  appeal  cannot
       otherwise be justly determined.

    The panel went on to say this

       The issues in the asylum appeal had been fully determined  and  those
       issues were essentially credibility - not in-country questions to  be
       determined with the assistance of expert evidence.

    and to conclude that they were not satisfied as required by the rule.

 9. The panel referred at paragraph 25 to Judge Hall's findings of fact  at
    his paragraph 28, and said this

       It is unnecessary to set all of those findings out here,  suffice  it
       to say that at paragraph 29 the judge said that each and every one of
       his findings of fact led him to the conclusion that the appellant had
       been an untruthful and unreliable witness.

    They went on to refer at paragraph 41 to Devaseelan; while they did not
    go into further  details  about  this  very  well-known  decision,  the
    guideline they were thinking of was clearly (6):

       If before the second Adjudicator the Appellant relies on  facts  that
       are not materially different from those put to the first Adjudicator,
       and proposes to support the claim by what  is  in  essence  the  same
       evidence as that available to the Appellant at that time, the  second
       Adjudicator  should  regard  the  issues  as  settled  by  the  first
       Adjudicator's determination and make his findings in line  with  that
       determination rather than allowing the matter to be re-litigated.

10. The panel reviewed the likely effect of the proposed evidence from  Mrs
    Enayat, as a well-known 'country expert', giving expert opinion on  the
    plausibility of the appellant's account, and concluded as follows:

       The issue was essentially credibility [always a matter for the judge,
       not an expert witness] and given the nature of the appellant's  story
       an expert report was unlikely to have taken the case much further.

11. Permission to appeal was given on the basis that

            a) the appellant's solicitors  might  not  have  had  a  proper
               opportunity to take proper instructions  and  then  consider
               whether expert evidence  was  necessary,  in  particular  on
               whether the appellant's conviction would put him at risk  on
               return; and

            b) the fact of  the  appellant's  conviction  amounted  to  new
               evidence, in terms of the panel's approach to Devaseelan.

12. So  far  as  the  facts  behind  the  appellant's  original  claim  are
    concerned, Judge Hall's  findings  were  just  as  they  had  said:  at
    paragraph  28,  he  reached  nine  separate  conclusions  against   the
    appellant on his personal credibility,  for  reasons  relating  to  his
    individual history, and not to the plausibility  or  otherwise  of  the
    Iranian  security  forces  taking  a  particular  interest  in  getting
    information out of someone from his village. While Mrs  Enayat's  views
    on this point were something they could legitimately  have  taken  into
    account, if they had had them  before  them,  the  panel  did  not  say
    anything to the  contrary,  but  simply  concluded  that  her  proposed
    evidence on it was unlikely to have made any  real  difference  to  the
    result.

13. While it was to say the least regrettable that the Home  Office  should
    have served a bundle only a few days before the hearing (the Tribunal's
    own  copy  was  not  received  till  10  July),  which  was  even  then
    incomplete,  it  would  certainly  have  been  possible,  and   equally
    certainly desirable, for a full copy of Judge Hall's decision  to  have
    been obtained and considered  by  the  panel  and  both  sides  at  the
    hearing, as they did for themselves  later.  However,  the  application
    before them was not for a short adjournment  for  this  purpose,  which
    could easily have been accommodated; but for one of at least two months
    to allow for 'country expert' evidence to be  given.  The  question  is
    whether the panel were entitled to take the view they did  on  whether,
    weighing the e-mail from Mrs Enayat, and what the solicitors said about
    it, against Judge Hall's findings of fact, the appeal could  be  justly
    determined without full evidence from her.

14. At the time of the first-tier hearing on 16 July  2013,  the  appellant
    had been aware of Judge Hall's findings against him  for  the  last  7�
    years, and his solicitors had at least been put on notice of them,  and
    that the Home Office were relying on them for their present decision on
    the appellant's renewed asylum claim, by  the  terms  of  the  decision
    letter they had received in early June. There was no application for an
    adjournment at all, nor any attempt to enlist  Mrs  Enayat's  services,
    till their letter of 12 July, where they did not even then refer to any
    need for expert evidence. That was first mentioned on 16 July, the  day
    of the hearing itself.

15. The panel did not refer to, but clearly had in mind, the provisions  of
    r. 4 of the Procedure Rules:

       The overriding objective of these Rules is to secure that proceedings
       before the Tribunal are handled as fairly, quickly and efficiently as
       possible; and, where appropriate, that members of the  Tribunal  have
       responsibility for ensuring this, in the interests of the parties  to
       the proceedings and in the wider public interest.

16. So far as the credibility  of  the  appellant's  original  account  was
    concerned, and bearing in mind that overriding objective  and  what  we
    have said at 12 - 14, we consider the panel were entitled to  take  the
    view that this very late application for two months' delay for a report
    from Mrs Enayat, not likely even then to  cast  any  serious  doubt  on
    Judge Hall's 7�-year old findings,  was  not  something  which  justice
    required to be granted.

17. Somewhat different considerations apply to the claim, not made  by  the
    appellant himself in his reply to the deportation notice, nor mentioned
    by Mrs Enayat in her e-mail of 15 July, which was the  one  before  the
    panel, to the effect that he might be at risk on return to Iran, simply
    by the fact of his conviction in this  country.  This  claim  was  only
    before the panel, if at all, by way of the assertion by the  solicitors
    themselves in their letter of 16  July,  set  out  at  7;  nor  was  it
    repeated by counsel at the hearing, so far  as  we  can  see  from  the
    panel's careful account of his submissions at paragraphs 22  and  35  -
    38, or the appellant's oral evidence, and this may have been  why  they
    did not see the need to deal with it. If it had been a live  point,  on
    the other hand, then it would of  course  have  been  a  new  one,  not
    covered by the panel's view on the effect of Devaseelan.

18. Our primary view on this point is that it was not something  which  the
    panel were required to consider in the first place in dealing with  the
    application for an adjournment; nor one on which they were required  to
    reconsider the need for 'country expert' evidence in the light of  what
    was said when they decided to go ahead with the hearing. No  doubt  Mrs
    Enayat had said something to the solicitors about it; but  the  factual
    basis for such a claim had not been laid by the  end  of  the  hearing,
    apart from the appellant's conviction itself.

19. However we thought it right,  in  the  interests  of  fairness  to  the
    appellant, to check our view on that point against what Mrs Enayat  did
    later say herself, in an e-mail of 8 August, not of course  before  the
    panel, but put before us by Miss Short. Here Mrs Enayat  makes  further
    reference to the point already dealt with, and goes on

       The other issue that I could comment on in this case  is  the  likely
       consequences on return of [the  appellant's]  recent  conviction  for
       money laundering in the UK. This is a complex  issue  as,  in  recent
       years, there has been a significant amount of  legislation  regarding
       money-laundering in Iran, prompted  in  part  by  pressure  from  the
       international community and the United Nations. In my report, I would
       be able to explain this context and comment on how, if this  came  to
       light when [the appellant] was screened on return, it could  lead  to
       his being imprisoned, prosecuted and punished,  particularly  if  his
       activities  are  perceived  to  be   political   and/or   linked   to
       transactions between Kurds in the diaspora.

20. This does not  provide  any  factual  basis  for  suggesting  that  the
    circumstances of the appellant's conviction were reasonably  likely  to
    become known to the  Iranian  authorities,  or  seen  as  political  or
    otherwise suspect if they did become known. It confirms our  view  that
    this 'double jeopardy' claim, only  before  the  panel  by  way  of  an
    assertion in the solicitors' letter, was not something they  needed  to
    deal with at all.
