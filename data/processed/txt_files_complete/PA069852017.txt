                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:     Mr G P McGowan, of Quinn Martin & Langan, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Clark, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iran,  born  in  June  1974.   He  sought
    asylum in the UK in June 2015, saying that he had been detained by  the
    Basij for 10 months for setting fires and using fireworks, and would be
    at risk from the authorities  if  returned.   The  respondent  did  not
    accept his account, and refused his claim.  In the FtT, Judge  Bradshaw
    found his account not credible, and dismissed his appeal.   His  appeal
    rights were exhausted on 10 August 2016.

 2. The appellant made further submissions  on  16  March  2017,  based  on
    having converted to Christianity.  In a decision dated 3 July 2017, the
    respondent did not accept that he was a genuine Christian.

 3. In the FtT, Judge David C Clapham, in  a  decision  promulgated  on  31
    October 2017, at [57] took  the  decision  of  Judge  Bradshaw  as  his
    starting point, asked why, if the appellant was not credible before, he
    should be believed now, and dismissed the appeal.

 4. On 20 November 2017, FtT Judge Keane granted permission  to  appeal  to
    the UT, on the view that there had arguably been "real scope  for  fact
    finding" notwithstanding failure of the first claim.

 5. In a decision promulgated on 9 April 2018,  Deputy  UT  Judge  Farrelly
    held that Judge Clapham had taken the previous negative  finding  as  a
    factor but not as determinative, no material  error  of  law  had  been
    shown, and the FtT's decision was to stand.

 6. On 3 July 2018, UT Judge Perkins refused permission to  appeal  to  the
    Inner House of the Court of Session.

 7. The Court granted permission to appeal.  In terms  of  an  interlocutor
    dated 3 October 2019, following upon a joint minute by the parties, the
    Court set aside the decision of Judge Farrelly and remitted to  the  UT
    for consideration anew.

 8. The joint minute agrees, in light of TF & MA (Iran)  SC  81,  that  the
    findings of the tribunals left doubt as  to  the  standard  applied  in
    assessing the appellant's claim to have converted.

 9. Mr Clark and Mr McGowan agreed on further procedure, as follows.

10. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.  The nature of the case is such  that  it
    is appropriate under section 12 of the 2007  Act,  and  under  Practice
    Statement 7.2, to remit to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.   The
    member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case  are  not  to  include
    Judge Clapham.

11. The FtT made an anonymity direction.  The matter was not  addressed  in
    the UT, so that remains in place.
