Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms K Wass, Counsel, instructed by Michael Ren�
                    Immigration Services
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant was refused entry clearance to settle in the UK with  his
    British wife, the sponsor Dennica Jones.  The appeal against the  entry
    clearance refusal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Kainth, in
    a decision promulgated on 17 June 2014.  The sponsor  appeared  at  the
    hearing, but was not legally represented.

2.    The  appellant,  again  without  legal  representation,  applied   for
    permission to appeal.  This was granted on 7 October 2014 by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Pooler.  Having noted that there was  no  representation
    at the hearing, or for the grounds, Judge Pooler indicated that he  had
    read the determination with particular care.  Permission to appeal  was
    granted on the basis that the judge had arguably  failed  to  determine
    the appeal on Article 8 grounds, which had been raised in the notice of
    appeal.

3.   The hearing was originally listed in the Upper Tribunal on 18  November
    2014, but was adjourned  following  receipt  of  an  application,  with
    supporting medical evidence, from the sponsor.

4.   At the hearing on 12 March  2015  the  sponsor  was  present,  and  the
    appellant was, for the first time, legally represented.   A  bundle  of
    documents under cover of a letter dated 6 March 2015 had been submitted
    in advance of the hearing.

5.   The debate at the hearing was not  about  whether  there  had  been  an
    error of law in the judge's decision,  but  rather  about  whether  the
    error in not considering Article 8 at  all  was  a  material  one.   Mr
    Wilding accepted that Article 8 had  been  raised  in  the  grounds  of
    appeal to the First-tier, although he noted  that  no  particulars  had
    been provided.  He also  accepted  that  the  judge  had  considered  a
    statement from the sponsor, which was mentioned at paragraph 13 of  the
    judge's determination.  His submission, however, was  that  this  could
    not have amounted  to  evidence  capable  of  showing  very  compelling
    circumstances  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   The   evidence   was
    therefore not present for a positive Article 8 case to be put.

6.   Ms Wass submitted that the error in not  dealing  with  Article  8  was
    material.  She pointed to the circumstances  set  out  in  the  witness
    statement, some of which predated the Entry Clearance Officer's refusal
    in May 2013.

Error of Law

7.   As I indicated at the hearing I have decided  that  the  error  in  not
    considering Article 8 was material.  It is certainly the case  that  it
    is very difficult for an Article 8 argument  to  succeed  in  an  entry
    clearance appeal, but it cannot be said that the door has  been  closed
    to the possibility of arguments of  this  sort  succeeding  in  certain
    cases, depending on the facts.

8.   The Article 8 assessment,  had  it  been  conducted,  would  have  been
    concerned with the circumstances at the date of decision.  The  essence
    of the sponsor's statement  prepared  for  the  hearing  was  that  the
    continuing separation of the couple had a significant impact  not  only
    on the sponsor, but also on her  son,  the  appellant's  stepson.   The
    statement described his emotional distress at the separation.  It  then
    referred to the sponsor discovering that she was pregnant on  returning
    from one of her visits to the appellant in Jamaica.   She  subsequently
    had a miscarriage.  She described the significant emotional  impact  of
    this on her, and her belief that it  was  connected  to  the  level  of
    stress that  she  was  under,  which  was  in  turn  connected  to  her
    separation from the appellant, and to her overworking in  her  attempts
    to meet the financial requirements.  She then went on to mention in the
    statement that she was  pregnant  again,  and  was  anxious  about  the
    possibility of suffering another miscarriage.  (A happy  postscript  to
    this is that the sponsor attended the hearing in March with  her  baby,
    her son with the appellant, who was born on 1 December 2014.)

9.   For an error of law to be material there must have been  the  potential
    for it to alter the outcome of the appeal.   In  my  view  the  matters
    raised in the statement were  significant  matters  of  substance  that
    required, in fairness, a proper  examination.   This  was  therefore  a
    situation where Article 8 had been formally raised in  the  grounds  of
    appeal, and  there  were  matters  of  substance,  concerned  with  the
    physical and emotional wellbeing of the appellant's wife  and  stepson,
    which deserved full and proper consideration.  On that basis it appears
    to me that the agreed error of law in not considering Article 8  cannot
    be properly characterised, in this particular appeal, as one  that  was
    not a material error.

Remittal

10.  There was a reference in the more recent statement, at paragraph 7,  to
    an issue of whether the sponsor's second job  had  accurately  reported
    the correct hours and tax to HMRC, as reflected in  the  P60.   Despite
    this it was confirmed by Ms Wass that the Article 8 point was the  only
    one being pursued.  The judge's findings in relation to the Immigration
    Rules, that the sponsor's earnings fell short of the  required  �18,600
    level at the date of decision, is therefore preserved.

11.  It was agreed between the parties that the appropriate course  was  for
    the appeal to be remitted  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a  fresh
    hearing, restricted to Article 8.  It was  noted  that  this  would  be
    concerned with what the circumstances were when the decision was  taken
    by the Entry Clearance Officer, in May 2013.  There was also  reference
    to a recent Court of Appeal case, in which judgement has not  yet  been
    delivered, dealing with a number of Article 8 challenges in cases where
    couples were unable to meet the financial requirements.  It may be that
    the Court of Appeal's judgment in these cases will be of assistance  in
    framing the approach to be taken to Article 8.

12.  It was not suggested that there was  any  need  for  anonymity  in  the
    appeal, and I make no such order.  No  mention  was  made  of  the  fee
    award, and in particular there was no application  for  this.   In  the
    circumstances I can  see  no  reason  to  interfere  with  the  judge's
    approach not to make a fee award.  The issue could be reopened  at  the
    remitted hearing.

Notice of Decision

The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is allowed. The appeal is remitted  to  the
First-tier Tribunal for a hearing to  consider  Article  8  only,  with  the
judge's findings in relation to the Immigration Rules preserved.

No anonymity direction is made.
