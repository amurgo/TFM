Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance or representation
For the Respondent:    Mr J Parkinson, Home Office Presenting Officer


                    NOTICE OF INVALID APPEAL AND REASONS

 1. The appellant who is a citizen of Pakistan, born on  10  January  1991,
    appeals  with  permission  against  the  determination  of   First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Holder, sitting at Newport, promulgated on 10 June  2013
    in which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of
    the respondent to refuse to grant him further leave to remain as a Tier
    4 (General) Student.

 2. When the  matter  came  before  me  there  was  no  appearance  by  the
    appellant.  I deferred the matter until 12:30pm by which time there was
    still no appearance by the appellant.  I caused enquiries to be made by
    court staff who informed me that although they had attempted to contact
    the appellant using the mobile telephone number given by him, there was
    no response.  I am satisfied from the court file that due notice of the
    time, date and venue of the hearing was served on the appellant at  the
    address given by  him  but  there  is  no  appearance  by  him  and  no
    explanation for that.  In all  the  circumstances  of  the  case  I  am
    satisfied to deem it appropriate to proceed in the appellant's absence.



 3. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom with leave to remain  as  a
    Tier 4 Student on 21 June 2011 with leave to remain  until  29  October
    2012.  His case is that  on  24  October  2012  he  submitted  a  valid
    application for further leave to remain as a Tier 4  (General)  Student
    with a valid CAS and the required bank statements  in  support  of  the
    application.  The respondent rejected that  application  on  the  basis
    that it was invalid  as  the  payment  could  not  be  processed.   The
    appellant then re-submitted the application on 4 February 2013 and that
    was again refused, on this occasion on the basis that, as the appellant
    was not a continuing student with an established presence in the United
    Kingdom, he was required but had failed to  provide  evidence  covering
    the relevant period to show that he had  maintenance  funds  of  �7,200
    plus any outstanding fees to be paid.

 4. The appellant appealed against that decision  on  the  basis  that  the
    Secretary of State's decision to treat his first application as invalid
    was not the correct one to take.  It is  also  submitted  that  in  any
    event he had provided sufficient evidence that he had the correct funds
    as a continuing student, on the basis that the decision to  reject  the
    first application was incorrect.

 5. The Secretary of State considered that there was no  valid  appeal.  On
    the basis of Basnet (validity of the application -  respondent)  [2012]
    UKUT 00113 the First-tier Tribunal directed the respondent to serve  on
    the Tribunal and the appellant the evidence upon which the assertion is
    made that the appeal is invalid, in  addition  to  any  other  evidence
    filed in accordance  with  Rule  13  of  2005  Procedural  Rules.   The
    appellant was also directed to file evidence to show that  his  account
    was in funds on the relevant date.

 6. The matter then came before Judge Holder who considered the  matter  on
    the papers.  It appears that the court file was given to him on 29  May
    2013 but his determination was not promulgated until 10 June 2013.   He
    records in his decision that the respondent had not served the required
    information in response to the directions made and had not  provided  a
    bundle at all and, mindful of the decision in Basnet,  considered  that
    there was a valid appeal.  He then went on to find at paragraph 17 that
    the appellant had not submitted evidence that he had either the  �2,000
    relevant if he were a student with established presence  or  �7,500  in
    his NatWest Bank account for a continuous period of 28  days  prior  to
    either 24 October 2012 or 4 February 2013.  He then went on to  dismiss
    the appeal under Article 8 as well.

 7. The appellant then applied  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the grounds:

          i) that his application was valid; and

         ii) that he had submitted the correct evidence showing that he had
             the relevant funds in place and the judge failed to take  that
             into account.

 8. Permission was granted on all grounds by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb.

 9. It appears from the court file that the respondent did in fact serve  a
    bundle on the Tribunal which is marked as "received at Newport"  on  29
    May 2013.  It is not clear from the file why that  is  not  before  the
    judge but it appears  that  there  has  been  an  administrative  error
    whereby it was not placed before the judge.  I am satisfied  that  this
    is a procedural irregularity  and  it  is  apparent  from  this  bundle
    firstly that there were bank statements from the appellant from NatWest
    Bank amongst other documents in support  of  his  application.   It  is
    clear from the judge's determination  that  he  was  unaware  of  those
    documents and, owing to a procedural error,  he  reached  a  conclusion
    without having had regard to material evidence,  capable  of  affecting
    his decision. The determination is thus unsustainable.  It is therefore
    necessary to re-make the decision and in doing so, I consider that  the
    entire decision has to be re-made, given the nature of the error.

10. The judge's conclusion with respect to the validity of the  appeal  was
    incorrect.  As Mr Parkinson submitted,  the  letter  which  appears  at
    Annex C1 of the respondent's bundle is a letter from the  appellant  in
    which he accepts that the reason the bank refused to honour payment  to
    the respondent was that he had upgraded his bank account to  a  current
    account, that his bank had closed the basic account and sent him a  new
    debit card and that he had tried to inform the UKBA of that by  sending
    a new visa application and provided the new  card  details  with  these
    applications.  There is no evidence before me that that was done and  I
    consider that the Secretary of State was entitled to  conclude  on  the
    facts of this case, that there had been no proper payment made

11. It appears from this letter that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  acted
    properly in rejecting the application as invalid.  The facts  here  are
    entirely different from those in Basnet.  The Secretary of State has, I
    consider provided sufficient evidence in the form of a letter from  the
    appellant admitting that there were  debt  problems  with  payment  and
    accordingly there was no procedural unfairness in this case.

12. I therefore re-make the decision on the basis  that  the  Secretary  of
    State has satisfied me in line with the decision  in  Basnet  that  the
    decision to reject the purported application on  24  October  2012  was
    correct.  It follows from that that there was no valid appeal and  that
    the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to consider it.





13. I therefore re-make the determination by recording  that  the  Tribunal
    had no jurisdiction to consider the appeal and there  is  therefore  no
    valid appeal pending.

SUMMARY OF DECISIONS

   1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of  a
      material error of law and I set it aside.


   2. I remake the decision by concluding that there  was  no  valid  appeal
      before the First-tier Tribunal.
