Representation:

For the Appellant:       Ms N Nnamani, Counsel instructed by Howe and Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Chris Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mr Chham Bahadur Pun and Mr Ram Prasad Pun against
    the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Chudleigh, promulgated on the
    17th July 2017,  to  dismiss  the  appeals  against  refusal  of  their
    applications for entry clearance (hereafter, "the decision") as the son
    of Sasiram Pun (hereafter, "the sponsor").

 2. The appellants are citizens of Nepal, who were respectively born on the
    17th March 1981 and the 6th August 1986, and the sponsor  is  a  person
    with settled  status  in  the  United  Kingdom  which  was  granted  in
    recognition of his military service with the Brigade of Gurkas  in  the
    British Army.

 3. The respondent's reasons for refusing their applications were that  the
    appellants did not meet the  requirements  under  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as  adult
    dependent relatives, and the respondent was not  satisfied  that  there
    was a sufficient degree of dependency between the appellants and  their
    parents to constitute family life and  thus  to  engage  the  potential
    operation of Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.

 4. The background to  the  appeals  can  be  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellants have  five  other  siblings.  Two  are  married  and  living
    independent lives with their families in Baglung. Another (Bal  Bhadur)
    has disabilities and lives with their parents in  the  United  Kingdom.
    The other two (Lokendra and Denesh) live with  the  appellants  in  the
    family home in Baglung. The sponsor has had settled  status  since  his
    arrival in the UK on the 9th July 2010. He has not visited Nepal  since
    then, although his  wife  has  done  so  on  one  occasion.  The  first
    appellant worked as a labourer in Malaysia between 2009  and  2013.  He
    was unable to save any of his earnings due to the agency  fees  he  had
    incurred in obtaining that employment. There is little  work  available
    in their village in Nepal. The appellants are however sometimes able to
    find work cutting grass and ploughing fields. They live too far away to
    be able to commute to work in the cities. The sponsor sends an  average
    of �1,923.70 a year to the second appellant.

 5. Judge Chudleigh was not  satisfied  that  the  appellants  were  wholly
    financially dependent upon the sponsor. She noted that she did not have
    any evidence from the second appellant and that  the  evidence  of  the
    first appellant was "sketchy" and had failed to  mention  his  work  in
    Malaysia. She concluded that the sums remitted by the sponsor to  Nepal
    were intended to 'top up' the income of all four of his sons living  in
    the family home. The total annual amount thus equated  to  around  �500
    for each adult child. The judge accepted that it was part  of  Nepalese
    culture for adult children to be considered as part of  their  parents'
    family unit until they were married. She also accepted that there  were
    what she described as "occasional" telephone calls between the  sponsor
    and the appellants. She was however unable to find that the appellants'
    current emotional ties to their parents in the UK  were  anything  more
    than the ordinary love and affection that one expects  between  parents
    and adult children She was not therefore satisfied that the  appellants
    had established 'family life' with the sponsor [paragraphs 33  to  37].
    She also made it clear that had she found Article 8 to be engaged, then
    she  would  have  found  the  appellants  exclusion  from  the  UK  was
    disproportionate in furthering the legitimate objective of  maintaining
    immigration controls. She would in those circumstances  have  therefore
    allowed the appeals [paragraphs 38 to 40].

 6. Ms Nnamani submitted that the judge had materially erred in law by  (a)
    failing to refer to the leading authorities in relation to the  correct
    approach to Article 8 cases involving the 'historic injustice' suffered
    by former Ghurkha soldiers and their families,  and  (b)  unfairly  and
    inaccurately characterising the telephone contact between  the  sponsor
    and the appellants as "occasional". Ms Nnamani further submitted  that,
    upon her own findings, the judge was bound to conclude that family life
    existed between the appellants  and  their  parents  and  that  it  was
    perverse  to  have  concluded  otherwise.  Given  that  the  judge  had
    expressly stated that she would have allowed the appeals had she  found
    family life to have  been  established,  it  followed  that  we  should
    reverse her decision to dismiss the appeals.

 7. We do not accept those submissions. We agree with Mr Avery that the key
    question is whether the judge applied the appropriate legal  principles
    to the facts as found she found them to be,  rather  than  whether  she
    cited the case-law that enunciates those principles. The  leading  case
    concerning the approach to the 'historic wrong'  in  Ghurkha  cases  is
    arguably Ghising and others  (Ghurkhas/BOCs:  historic  wrong;  weight)
    [2013] UKUT 00567 (IAC) in which the Tribunal concluded that -

      ..., where it is found that Article 8 is  engaged  and,  but  for  the
      historic wrong, the Appellant would have been settled in the  UK  long
      ago, this will ordinarily determine  the  outcome  of  the  Article  8
      proportionality assessment in an Appellant's favour, where the matters
      relied on by the Secretary of State/ entry clearance  officer  consist
      solely of the  public  interest  in  maintaining  a  firm  immigration
      policy. [Emphasis added]

    As  we  have  already  observed,  the  judge  faithfully  applied  this
    principle upon the premise (which she did not accept) that family  life
    had been established. The decision in Ghishing did not  however  assist
    her in approaching the question of whether Article  8  was  potentially
    engaged in the first place. In relation to that issue, the judge  would
    have been guided by decisions such as Kugathas v The Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2003] EWCA Civ 31 and Singh v The Secretary of
    State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 630, in which it was held
    that there needs to be something  more  than  the  love  and  affection
    between an adult and his parents or siblings  in  order  to  justify  a
    finding of a family life for the purposes of  Article  8.  That  is  of
    course precisely the test that the judge applied at paragraph 36 of her
    decision

 8. We also reject the  submission  that  the  judge  came  to  a  perverse
    conclusion. As Stanley-Burnton LJ said in  Singh,  the  answer  to  the
    question of whether Article 8 is engaged, "all depends on  the  facts".
    It was in our view reasonably open for  the  judge  to  find  that  the
    payments made by the sponsor to  the  second  appellant  were  intended
    simply to "top up" the income of the household of which the  appellants
    (together with two of their siblings) were  members,  and  we  did  not
    understand Ms Nnamani to be suggesting that we should  go  behind  that
    finding. In our judgement, it was not  perverse  for  the  Tribunal  to
    find, on the particular facts of  this  case,  that  regular  financial
    contributions by a parent to an adult  child,  with  whom  he  had  not
    resided for many years, provided an insufficient basis for a finding of
     'family life' and consequent engagement of the potential operation  of
    Article 8.  Similarly,  whilst  the  judge's  characterisation  of  the
    telephone contact between  them  as  "occasional"  may  not  have  been
    entirely apposite, we do not consider this to have been material to the
    judge's overall assessment of the potential engagement of Article 8.
