For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    None


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   In this determination the  Secretary  of  State  as  the  Appellant  is
    referred to as the Secretary of State and the Respondent is referred to
    as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant, a national of  Bangladesh,  date  of  birth  25  December
    1989, appealed against the decision of the Secretary of State dated  26
    June 2013 to refuse a combined application for leave to  remain  on  26
    October 2012 seeking leave to remain as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
    Migrant.  The Secretary of State also refused the  matter  and  made  a
    decision  to  make  removal  directions  under  Section   47   of   the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

3.   An appeal against those  decisions  was  made  to  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Aziz (the judge) who on 2 June  2014  allowed  the  appeal  under
    paragraph 245ZX finding that the claimant had met the  requirements  of
    the  Rules  by  reason  of  having  the  necessary   English   language
    qualification and by providing a relevant test certificate  as  defined
    in paragraph 118(b)(ii)(1) - (3) of Appendix A to the Immigration Rules
    (the Rules).

4.   The  Secretary  of  State  sought  permission  to  appeal  the  judge's
    decision which was granted on 27 June 2014 by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    P J M Hollingworth.

5.   Notice of hearing was served on the Claimant  at  his  last  identified
    address and upon his representatives at their last notified address  by
    notice dated 9 July 2014.

6.   Neither notice has been returned to the  Tribunal  undelivered  and  no
    representations  have  been  made  by  either  the  Claimant   or   his
    representatives concerning the hearing  today.   I  am  satisfied  that
    notice of hearing was given identifying Monday 18 August 2014 at 2pm as
    being the  appropriate  time  to  attend  at  Field  House,  15  Breams
    Buildings, London EC4.

7.   No request for an adjournment was made, no explanation for absence  was
    given and in the circumstances, having  considered  the  case  file,  I
    decided that it was fair, consistent with the overriding objectives, to
    proceed with the appeal in the absence of the Claimant.

8.   It is common ground that the  Claimant  had  three  TOEIC  certificates
    indicating that he had met the required reading and listening, as  well
    as the speaking, and writing] requirements so as to meet as a fact  the
    four English language components at level B2 (CEFR).

9.    It  is  accepted  that  that  evidence  was  contained  within   three
    certificates and in the circumstances there is no challenge to the fact
    that paragraph 118 of the Rules required the applicant  to  provide  an
    original English language test certificate  from  an  English  language
    test provider and within that it should show the applicant's name,  the
    achievement of all four components  and  the  date  of  the  award  (my
    emphasis).

10.  The judge concluded that it  was  open  to  read  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 118 of the Rules as enabling two or more documents to be read
    as if they were one.

11.  In reasoning which I have to say is confusing in paragraph  37  of  the
    determination it appears that the judge was concluding that  you  could
    have one document which was an English language certificate showing the
    components had been met but reliant upon other  documents  which  taken
    together, as he put it showed that the Claimant was able  to  meet  the
    relevant English language standard and the requirements of the Rules.

12.  I find the  wording  of  paragraph  118(b)(ii)  of  Appendix  A  wholly
    unequivocal and clear as to what was required; One certificate must  be
    produced.     I do not accept the point that there is a  general  right
    to read into the Rules flexibility where none is provided for.

14.  It is clear that what the Claimant should have done, when the  language
    problem was identified, was made a fresh  application  having  obtained
    the necessary supporting documents as required to meet the requirements
    of the Rules.  However, that did not come to pass and I cannot  resolve
    that matter now.   In  the  circumstances  I  find  that  the  original
    Tribunal made an error of law in seeking  to  widely  construe  several
    documents as being one certificate.

15.  The matter will have to be remade.  I decided whether  or  not  it  was
    necessary, in the  light  of  the  absence  of  the  Claimant,  or  his
    representatives, the remaking matter should  proceed today.

16.  In the light of the  above  facts  set  out  and  the  absence  of  any
    response or any other indication to  show  how  certificates  could  be
    justified I concluded that there was  no  single  certificate  provided
    which set out all of the components as required under paragraph 118 set
    out above find that the appeal by the claimant fails

17.  The Original Tribunal's  decision  can  not  stand  and  the  following
    decision is substituted.

18.   The appeal on immigration grounds is dismissed.

ANONYMITY
No anonymity order was made nor is one now necessary or appropriate.

FEE AWARD
In remaking this case the appeal has failed and therefore there  can  be  no
fee award in the sum of ï¿½140 or otherwise in favour of the Claimant.


Signed                                  Date 19 August 2014
