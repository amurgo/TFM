For the Respondent:    None (Mr Fadairo appeared in person)


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   Although this appeal was allowed at the First-tier, and  the  appellant
    is the Secretary of State, I will refer to the parties as they were  at
    the First-tier.

2.   The appellant's application as a Tier 4 Student, to study for a  master
    of  science  degree  in  business  economics  at  the   University   of
    Portsmouth, was refused on  21  February  2014.   The  Confirmation  of
    Acceptance for Studies (CAS) document was accepted, but the application
    was refused on  funds,  which  turned  on  the  issue  of  whether  the
    appellant had  paid  fees  to  the  university  of  �3,850  before  the
    application was made.

3.   The appeal was allowed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Clough,  in  a
    decision promulgated on 28 November 2014.   Permission  to  appeal  was
    granted by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan.   The  application  for
    permission to appeal was on the basis that the judge had erred  in  law
    in allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules when  the  appellant
    had admitted that he had forgotten to provide an original  receipt  for
    the fees.

4.   The appellant appeared in person at  the  error  of  law  hearing.   He
    indicated that  he  had  started  the  MSc  in  business  economics  in
    September 2014, and was due to finish in September 2015.  He said  that
    the handwritten alteration to the CAS, where the figure of  �3,850  had
    been crossed out and replaced by the figures 0.00,  was  an  alteration
    made by a lady in  the  Portsmouth  University  International  Students
    Office.   He  had  paid  all  of  the  fees  before  he  submitted  his
    application.

Error of Law

5.   As I indicated at the hearing I have decided that the judge did err  in
    law, in a manner material to the outcome, in taking  into  account  the
    receipt that the appellant sent in with his appeal form.  This was  not
    evidence submitted  with  the  application.   In  points-based  appeals
    section 85A of the 2002  Act,  which  was  in  force  at  the  date  of
    decision, rendered inadmissible any evidence  not  submitted  with  the
    application.  This does not appear to have been considered and  applied
    by the judge, who incorrectly directed himself  that  the  receipt  was
    evidence that could be taken into account because it was  in  existence
    at the date of decision.  This is a confusion with the  law  applicable
    in entry clearance appeals.

Remaking

6.   There was an examination, with the assistance of Mr Walker, to  whom  I
    am grateful, of the correct method for remaking  the  decision  in  the
    appeal.  After consideration of various issues Mr  Walker  agreed  that
    the correct course was for the  appeal  to  be  allowed  to  a  limited
    extent, as not in accordance with the law, to enable the application to
    be reconsidered.

7.   The basis for this sensible agreed position was as follows.

8.    Paragraph  13C  of  Annex  C  to  the  Immigration  Rules  gives   two
    alternatives.  The first is that the CAS checking service entry  should
    confirm details of fees already paid.  The second is that  an  original
    paper receipt should be provided.  Although the paper receipt cannot be
    considered as admissible evidence in the appeal, for the reasons  given
    above, there is an outstanding issue in relation to  the  CAS  checking
    service.

9.   From the refusal letter  it  is  unclear  whether  the  decision  maker
    consulted the CAS checking service.  The decision maker  did  have  the
    CAS which is in the  respondent's  bundle.   On  this  the  handwritten
    alteration has been made, as described above.  This was, unfortunately,
    less than clear.  What is also unclear is the exact nature of  the  CAS
    checking service, and Mr Walker was not able to help on this point.  It
    is presumably a checking service that operates digitally.  In any event
    the alteration on the CAS should have rung some alarm bells  about  the
    safety of treating the CAS as indicating that no fees  had  been  paid,
    rather than that all  of  them  had  been  paid.   The  next  point  of
    information was on the application form itself, which  was  before  the
    decision maker.  At page 7 of the application form the appellant stated
    that he had paid �3,850 in fees, and that  the  evidence  that  he  was
    providing to show that this amount had been paid was the information on
    the CAS (not a receipt).

10.  Although paragraph 245AA, concerned with evidential flexibility,  would
    not cover a situation where an appellant had simply failed to  remember
    to submit a document, such as a receipt, in this case there was  enough
    to justify the decision maker referring to  the  CAS  checking  service
    entry.  As I have said Mr Walker agreed that  the  failure  to  do  so,
    given that  this  was  an  alternative  to  the  paper  receipt  within
    paragraph  13C,  was  a  matter  that  rendered  the  decision  not  in
    accordance with the law.

11.  As I explained to the appellant this means that it is open  to  him  to
    make any other submissions,  and  submit  any  further  evidence.   The
    restrictions on the consideration of evidence  not  submitted  with  an
    application does not apply to the Secretary of State.  I  suggested  to
    the appellant that he should take this decision  to  the  International
    Students Office at the University  of  Portsmouth  and  ask  for  their
    assistance in ensuring that the information on the CAS checking service
    as to the position with his fees is up-to-date.  They could also  offer
    assistance in suggesting where and how any further required information
    could be provided to the correct Home Office caseworker.

12.  No issue as to anonymity was raised by either side, and I make no  such
    order.  The appellant made no application for  a  fee  award.   I  have
    nevertheless considered whether to make a fee award, and have  decided,
    given that the matter remains somewhat unclear, that a fee award is not
    justified.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the appeal is set aside.
The decision is remade as follows.
The appeal is allowed to the limited extent that the  decision  was  not  in
accordance with the law, and the application remains outstanding.
