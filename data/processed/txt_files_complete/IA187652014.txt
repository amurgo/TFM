For the Appellant:     Mr S Kerr.  Karis Law Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State (to whom we shall refer  as
    the respondent) against the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    promulgated on 4 August 2015 in three appeals in which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal upheld the first appellant's appeal against a decision of  the
    respondent to refuse him a residence card under the  Immigration  (EEA)
    Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations) and the  respondent's  decision
    to seek the appellant's removal under Section 10 of the Immigration and
    Asylum Act 1999. A further appeal against the respondent's decision  to
    refuse to issue him with permanent residence on the basis  of  marriage
    to an EEA national was abandoned at the outset of a hearing before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The first appellant is an Albanian national born on  10  January  1981.
    He claimed to have first arrived in the United Kingdom as  a  minor  in
    1998 and applied  for  asylum  which  was  refused  in  2000.   He  was
    therefore removed to Albania in 2004.   However  no  records  exist  in
    relation to that matter and the respondent does not accept  that  as  a
    matter of fact.

3.   However, he was granted entry clearance into the United Kingdom  on  25
    October 2005 on EEA family permit to join  his  then  wife,  a  Swedish
    national.  He was granted an EEA residence card as a  non-EEA  national
    in July 2006 valid until July 2011.

4.   On 28 January 2008 the appellant was convicted at  Inner  London  Crown
    Court of possession of cocaine with intent to supply.   The  sentencing
    judge's remarks are quoted at page 4 of the respondent's letter  of  29
    April 2009 setting out the reasons for  a  deportation  order.   It  is
    clear that the sentencing judge viewed the appellant  as  a  commercial
    supplier having all the trappings of a commercial drug dealer.  He  was
    found with �1,200 in his car, �685 cash at home, 50 grammes of cocaine,
    digital scales,  plastic  bags  and  cling  film.   The  appellant  was
    sentenced to three years imprisonment.

5.   A deportation order was then made  upon  him  which  was  intimated  by
    letter of 29 April  2009.  His  appeal  against  that  deportation  was
    dismissed on 10 June 2009  and  shortly  thereafter  he  was  deported.
    However he re-entered the United Kingdom sometime in that same year  in
    breach of that order.

6.   He was divorced from his Swedish wife in June 2011 but  then  submitted
    an application for EEA permanent residence on  the  basis  of  retained
    rights of residence. That application was refused in January 2014.

7.   On  20  April  2014  the  appellant  married  a  Finnish  national  and
    submitted an EEA  residence  card  application  as  her  spouse.   That
    application was  refused.   He  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    against that decision.

8.   On 14 April 2014 the appellant was served with a notice  under  Section
    10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 as a person liable to removal
    as an illegal entrant since he had returned to the  United  Kingdom  in
    breach of his deportation order.  The appellant appealed that  decision
    to the First-tier Tribunal also.  On 8 October 2014 and 20  April  2015
    the First-tier Tribunal sat  to  consider  his  appeals  against  these
    orders.  As stated above, his representative did not proceed  with  the
    appeal against the decision to refuse the appellant permanent residence
    but insisted on his appeal against the refuse to issue him a  residence
    card and the decision to seek his removal from the United Kingdom under
    Section 10 of the 1999 Act.

9.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  concluded  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision to refuse to issue the appellant with a residence card on  the
    grounds under Regulation 20 of the 2006 Regulations  on  the  basis  of
    public policy or public security and the decision to seek  his  removal
    under Section 10 of the 1999 Act was not in accordance with the law and
    allowed those appeals.  The judge concluded that the tests contained in
    Regulation 21(3) and (5) were not made  out  and,  in  particular,  the
    personal conduct of the appellant did not represent a genuine,  present
    and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting  one  of  the  fundamental
    interests of society.

10.  The judge found that the appellant was married and  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship.  There was no evidence that he had  reoffended
    since his conviction of January 2008.  There was no evidence  that  the
    appellant posed a threat in any way. He was found to pose a low risk of
    reoffending in the reports available  from  his  trial  and  he  had  a
    genuine  intention  not  to  reoffend,  demonstrated  by  his  lack  of
    convictions since 2008.  The illegal entry into the United Kingdom  did
    not, by itself, show that his  behaviour poses a  genuine  and  serious
    threat to the fundamental interests of society.       The  judge  found
    that there was evidence of his social and cultural  integration  within
    the United Kingdom.  He had worked for many years in the United Kingdom
    in a London club and  appeared  to  be  rehabilitated.  He  spoke  good
    English.

11.  In the assessment of  proportionality  the  judge  had  regard  to  the
    single offence of which the Appellant had been committed, the  lack  of
    reoffending and the time that had passed since his  conviction  without
    any further offences.  She found that the decision to  remove  him  was
    disproportionate for someone who had a right of residence as  a  family
    member of an EEA national.  Although the breach of a deportation  order
    was serious  misbehaviour  clearly  undermining  the  effectiveness  of
    immigration laws, without more  evidence  of  serious  misconduct,  she
    could not find that behaviour alone to represent a genuine, present and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society so as to fulfil the requirements of Regulation 21(5).

12.  Mr Wilding on behalf of the respondent  restricted  his  appeal  to  an
    attack on the First-tier Tribunal's findings that the grounds  set  out
    in Regulation 21(5) had not been made out.  He pointed out that in this
    case the appellant was entitled to the lowest level  of  protection  as
    set out in Regulation 21(5) and (6).  It was not a necessary  criterion
    that the appellant had been convicted of criminality.   The  First-tier
    Tribunal had materially  erred  in  their  assessment  of  whether  the
    appellant  represented  the  serious  threat  envisaged  by  Regulation
    21(5)(c).  It was  acknowledged  by  the  Tribunal  that  he  had  been
    convicted of a serious offence.  It was also accepted that  the  breach
    of his deportation order was serious misconduct.  No sufficient  weight
    had been placed on the serious nature of the original  conviction.  Nor
    was that conviction properly weighted in the context that he  had  been
    in breach of a deportation order for five years during  which  time  he
    worked illegally, deceiving his employers in  respect  of  his  illegal
    status.  During that period he had remarried in the UK.

13.  The failure to look at  these  matters  cumulatively,  the  failure  to
    recognise his continuing criminal behaviour in remaining  illegally  in
    the United Kingdom and deceiving his employers were material errors  in
    law.  The decision was an irrational and perverse one,  notwithstanding
    the evidential position accepted by the First-tier Judge.

14.  Mr Kerr for  the  appellant  submitted  that  we  should  dismiss  this
    appeal.  There was no error of law.  The judge had taken  into  account
    all relevant factors.   The  passage  of  time  since  the  appellant's
    conviction and his integration into society thereafter by  obtaining  a
    long term job demonstrated that he  was  not  a  genuine,  present  and
    serious threat in terms of the Regulations. In any event, the  Tribunal
    was entitled to come to that view.

15.  We consider that the First-tier Tribunal materially  erred  in  law  in
    this case by failing to have proper regard to the cumulative effect  of
    the conviction in 2008, the continuous nature of the criminal behaviour
    in breaching the deportation order and remaining in this country  since
    2009 on an illegal basis and his willingness to deceive  his  employers
    as to his illegal status.  It appears to us that in paragraphs 35 to 37
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge has artificially compartmentalised  these
    factors and has failed, in the proportionality exercise,  to  recognise
    their cumulative weight.

16.  It  is  stated  in  paragraph  35  that  by  itself  the  breach  of  a
    deportation order does not pose a necessary threat.   In  paragraph  36
    she finds that the appellant  is  socially  and  culturally  integrated
    within the United Kingdom because he is married and has worked here for
    many  years.   In  paragraph  37  she  considers  that   the   "serious
    misbehaviour" of the breach  of  the  deportation  order  cannot  alone
    represent the necessary serious threat without more evidence of serious
    misconduct.

17.  We have  concluded  that  this  fragmentative  approach  is  materially
    erroneous and for these reasons allow the Secretary of State's appeal.

18.  We announced our view at the end of submissions and invited Mr Kerr  to
    make any further  submissions  on  this  matter  after  an  appropriate
    adjournment.  In taking advantage of that opportunity Mr Kerr submitted
    that we should find that the grounds contained in Regulation 21(5) were
    not made out.  The two adverse features, namely the conviction and  the
    breach of the deportation order did not, even taken together, amount to
    a sufficiently serious threat to a  fundamental  interest  of  society.
    The appellant had pled guilty to the offence, he had not committed  any
    further offences and had been found to have fulfilled the intention not
    to reoffend.  His behaviour since had been  positive  in  that  he  had
    been  entrusted with a responsible job,  as  was  attested  to  by  the
    letter from  his employers in the appellant's bundle.

19.  The conviction was over eight years ago and he had entered  the  United
    Kingdom illegally six years ago.  It could not be said that  there  was
    any genuine and presently serious threat in those circumstances.

Discussion and Decision

20.  We have to  consider  whether  the  appellant's  conduct  represents  a
    genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one  of  the
    fundamental interests of society.   This must be based  exclusively  on
    the personal conduct of the appellant, and bearing  in  mind  that  his
    convictions alone do not justify his decision to remove him.   We  have
    had regard to his age, state of health, family and  economic  situation
    and his length of residence in the United  Kingdom  together  with  his
    social and cultural integration. No  issue  arose  in  respect  of  any
    severance of his links with Albania. We have to  consider  whether  his
    removal, in all the circumstances, would be proportionate.

21.  The relevant circumstances appear to us to be as follows.   This  is  a
    35 year old man who came to the United Kingdom in 2005 as  the  husband
    of an EEA national.  He had  no  previous  criminal  history.   He  was
    convicted of a serious offence in respect of  the  supply  of  Class  A
    drugs on the basis that he did so on a commercial basis.  Having served
    a substantial period of imprisonment he was lawfully deported from this
    country.  In blatant breach of that order he returned to  this  country
    and purported to establish a life here.  Although not  entitled  to  do
    so, he obtained employment once again, married for the second time  and
    claimed residence rights as a result thereof.

22.  He only obtained that employment by deceiving his employers as  to  his
    immigration status.  Furthermore, at paragraph 34 of the  determination
    it is plain that the First-tier Tribunal Judge found him to been wholly
    incredible when he asserted that his employer knew that  the  appellant
    had entered the United Kingdom illegally when he was re-employed.

23.  Accordingly, there exists in this case not  only  the  existence  of  a
    very serious criminal offence which strikes at  the  heart  of  ordered
    society but thereafter there is evidence of a determined breach on  the
    appellant's part of an order deporting him by re-entering this country.
     In addition, there is evidence of a continuing breach of that order by
    remaining in this country and deliberate deception of his employers  on
    a continuing basis in the failure to point out that his employers  were
    continuing to employ him on an illegal basis and thus exposing them  to
    sanctions.  There is also the circumstance that  he  was  found  to  be
    incredible in relation to his assertion that he had made his  employers
    aware of his illegal status.

24.  We have regard to his stable marital status but since  he  was  married
    in London at a time when he  ought not to have been  there, the  weight
    of this factor is diminished. We also note  that  he  has  remained  in
    employment since January 2013.  However, that employment  was  achieved
    by deception and again during a period where he ought not to have  been
    in this country.

25.  Accordingly, the life he has established  in  marriage  and  employment
    since his illegal return to the United Kingdom  has  been  achieved  in
    breach of immigration laws and in the course of committing a continuous
    criminal offence.  In all the circumstances we are satisfied  that  the
    personal conduct of the appellant does represent a genuine, present and
    sufficiently serious threat  affecting  the  fundamental  interests  of
    society.    His  criminal  conviction  coupled  with  his  ability   to
    disregard the deportation order and to deceive his  employers  in  that
    respect seems to us plainly to establish the level of threat to society
    envisaged in the Regulations. The weight to be attached to his years of
    employment  in  this  country  is  significantly  undermined   by   the
    circumstances by which it was achieved.

26.  Having regard to the cumulative nature of these circumstances  we  find
    it proportionate for the appellant to be removed in spite of the  right
    of residence acquired as a family member of an EEA national.

Notice of Decision

27.  Accordingly we will allow the appeal of the Secretary of State  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.  The linked decisions of the  First-tier  Tribunal  are
    set aside because of material error of law.

     The original  decisions  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  are  remade  as
    follows:

      The  decision  to  remove  the  appellant  under  Section  10  of  the
    Immigration and Asyslum Act 1999 is, we find, in  accordance  with  the
    law.

     His appeals under the Immigration (European Economic Area)  Regulations
    2006 and against his removal from the United  Kingdom  are  accordingly
    dismissed.i



No anonymity direction is made.
