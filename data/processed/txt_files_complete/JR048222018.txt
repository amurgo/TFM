                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:      Mr P Lewis of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Z Malik of Counsel, instructed by the Government
                  Legal Department









The Honourable Mr Justice Julian Knowles:

Introduction

   1. This is an application for judicial review of the Respondent's refusal
      to grant the Applicant indefinite leave to remain  (ILR).   Permission
      was granted by UT Judge Blum following an oral hearing on  6  November
      2018.


   2. For the reasons set out in this judgment I allow the claim  and  quash
      the Respondent's refusal of ILR.


   3. The Applicant was represented by Mr Lewis and  the  Respondent  by  Mr
      Malik.  I am  grateful  to  them  both  for  their  written  and  oral
      submissions.

Factual background

   4. The Applicant arrived in the UK on 18  January  2007,  with  an  entry
      clearance as a student, valid from 15 October 2006  until  31  October
      2009. He was granted further leave to remain as a Tier 1  (Post  Study
      Work) Migrant on 19 November 2009 until 19 November 2011  pursuant  to
      an application made on 30 October 2009. He was granted  further  leave
      to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on 3 June 2011  until  3  June
      2013, on an application made on 4 April 2011. He was  granted  further
      leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant on 16 July 2013 until 16
      July 2016, on an application made on 3 June 2013.
   5. On 11 March 2016, the Applicant amended his self-employment income. On
      24 June 2016, the Applicant made an application for  indefinite  leave
      to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant  which
      was refused on the same day.


   6. On 15 July 2016 the Applicant made an application for indefinite leave
      to remain in the UK as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant. On the Secretary of
      State's  invitation,  on  5  May  2017  he  completed  and   filed   a
      questionnaire in connection with his application.


   7. The Secretary of State refused this application for  indefinite  leave
      to remain on 9 March 2018, for two main reasons:


   a. First, the Secretary of State concluded that it was not desirable  for
      the Applicant to be granted indefinite leave  to  remain  due  to  his
      character and conduct pursuant to [322(5)] of  the  Immigration  Rules
      (the Rules).


   b. Secondly, the Secretary of State held that the  Applicant's  currently
      claimed earnings were not genuine as required by [19(i)] of Appendix A
      to the I Rules. These conclusions were based on the fact that  in  the
      Secretary of State's opinion there was a discrepancy in  the  earnings
      that the Applicant claimed in his earlier applications  for  leave  to
      remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant and  the  earnings  that  he  had
      declared to HMRC for the corresponding tax years.

   8. This is the decision  that  is  challenged  in  this  application  for
      judicial review.


   9. On 21 March 2018 the Applicant applied for an Administrative Review of
      the decision, maintaining that any discrepancies were  due  to  errors
      which were the fault of by the accountants then  acting  for  him  and
      that no dishonesty on his part had been  established.  The  Respondent
      maintained his refusal by a letter dated 17 April 2018.


  10. A Pre-Action Protocol letter was sent to  the  Respondent  on  25  May
      2018.


  11. By a letter dated 6 June 2018 the Respondent maintained  the  decision
      for the same reasons set out in the refusal of Administrative Review.


  12. Permission to apply for judicial review was refused by UT Judge  Kekic
      on 2 October 2018.  However, as I have said,  permission  was  granted
      following an oral hearing on 6 November 2018.  In summary,  permission
      was granted because in the judge's  view  it  was  arguable  that  the
      Respondent was not entitled to rely on [322(5)] of the Rules.


  13. For completeness, I note that on 24 April 2018 the  Applicant  made  a
      fresh application for indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of his
      long  residence  in  the  UK.  This  is  presently  pending  with  the
      Respondent.


The decision under challenge

  14. I should now set out the decision under challenge of 9 March  2018  in
      more detail.


  15. After setting out the Applicant's immigration history, the  Respondent
      said that in order to qualify for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier
      1 (General) Migrant, the Applicant had to  meet  the  requirements  of
      [245CD] of the Rules and also [19(i)] and [19(j)] of Appendix A to the
      Rules.  Paragraph 19(i) provides that the Secretary of State  must  be
      satisfied that the earnings claimed are from  genuine  employment  and
      that if he is not so satisfied then points for those earnings will not
      be awarded.


  16. The Secretary of State then set out  the  evidence  submitted  by  the
      Applicant  that  he  had  considered  in  making  this  assessment  of
      genuineness, including bank statements; letters from  the  Applicant's
      accountants; payslips; tax returns, as well as other documents.


  17. The letter pointed out that in the application dated 15 July 2016  the
      Applicant had claimed earnings of �60 531.26 for  the  period  29  May
      2015 to 27 May 2016 made up of earnings from various employers.


  18. The letter then set out various answers which the Applicant had  given
      in the May 2017 questionnaire.   Among these, he was asked whether  he
      had checked and signed the tax returns he had submitted as  supporting
      evidence and he replied:


             "Please note that the Tax Returns always were submitted online
             by the Accountant.  I had provided all supporting documents to
             the Accountant but I cannot remember whether I had to sign  it
             or not."


  19. He went on to confirm that he was satisfied that his tax returns  were
      accurate.


  20. He was also asked whether he had ever had to correct or resubmit a tax
      return and answered that in March 2016 he had been going  through  his
      previous tax returns with his accountant and discovered that there had
      been an error in his 2014 tax calculation.  He said he had immediately
      contacted HMRC and submitted an amended  return  for  that  year.   He
      later discovered an error in his 2011 tax calculation and  resubmitted
      for that year as well.   The Applicant submitted  a  letter  from  his
      accountant, Sheikh &  Co,  which  stated  that  there  had  been  some
      'inadvertent typographical inaccuracies' in the returns.  For example,
      the letter stated that for the tax  year  ended  5  April  2014  self-
      employed gross income and net income of �11 824 had been omitted  from
      his return 'due to clerical mistakes'.


  21. The Respondent's decision letter went on to  point  out  that  in  his
      initial Tier 1 (General) Application dated 4 April 2011 the  Applicant
      had claimed earnings of �43 993.89 for the period 1 April 2010  to  31
      March 2011, but that in his return to HMRC dated 13 October 2016,  for
      the year ended 5 April 2011, he claimed pay from employment of �17 764
      and self-employed income of �299.    The letter said that 'this  shows
      a significant difference of �25 930 [ie, �43 993.89 - �17 764 - �299 =
      �25 930] to what was declared to UKVI for application  dated  4  April
      2011.'   The letter went on to say that the Applicant had amended  the
      figures for the year ended 5 April 2011 to show pay  as  �17  764  and
      self-employed income of �26 229.


  22. The letter went on to point out  a  further  discrepancy  of  �11  824
      between what the Applicant had been declared as income in  support  of
      his Tier 1 (General) application dated 3 June  2013  and  in  his  tax
      return for the same period.


  23. It then said:


             "Having decided to work as self-employed in the United Kingdom
             it is your responsibility to ensure the correct declaration of
             earnings are  made  to  HMRC  at  the  correct  time,  whether
             prepared by yourself or a third  party.  At  question  11  you
             confirm the types of documents that were  used  in  order  for
             your accountant to prepare your self- assessment tax return(s)
             in the financial year(s) stated in your answer to  question  2
             included invoices  bank  statements,  dividend  vouchers,  pay
             slips, employers' letter. Therefore, since an  accountant  was
             used it is not credible that a professional  accountant  would
             make such fundamental mistakes when declaring taxes  to  HMRC,
             as the accounts would have been prepared based on the evidence
             md information provided by you. The onus is on you  to  ensure
             that the correct figures are submitted initially. You  have  a
             responsibility to maintain accurate records of  your  finances
             and tax liabilities.

             Consideration has been given to the explanations  provided  in
             your questionnaire and supporting evidence and the explanation
             to account for the amendments is not accepted.


             The Secretary of State is  satisfied  that  the  earnings  you
             declared in your previous Tier 1 (General) applications of  04
             April 2011 and 03 June  2013  are  not  consistent  with  your
             initial declarations made to HMRC in the relevant tax  period.
             The fact that your declared earnings to UKVI in your  previous
             Tier 1 (General) applications dated 04 April 2011 and 03  June
             2013 compared to what you  declared  to  HMRC  for  a  similar
             periods differed significantly, does not demonstrate that your
             declaration of earnings to both UKVI and HMRC are consistent.

             Had you declared earnings in your Tier 1 (General) application
             of 04 April 2011 and 03 June 2013 which were  consistent  with
             the  information  provided  to  HMRC  at  the  time   of   the
             applications, you would  not  have  scored  sufficient  points
             under the Immigration Rules for leave to remain to be granted.

             We are satisfied that, based  on  your  actions  in  declaring
             different amounts of income to HMRC and UKVI, you have  either
             misrepresented your earnings to HMRC in order to  reduce  your
             tax  liability  or  provided  false  information  about   your
             earnings to UKVI in order to obtain leave to remain, or both.


             In light of the above, and with regard to the fact  that  your
             declaration to HMRC did not  corroborate  with  your  earnings
             claimed in your previous applications, the Secretary of  State
             on balance of probabilities is not satisfied that  your  self-
             employed earnings claimed in your previous and current Tier  1
             (General) applications are genuine."


  24. The letter then referred  to  [322]  of  the  Rules  which  is  headed
      'Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave to  enter  or
      remain in the United Kingdom should  normally  be  refused'  and  sub-
      paragraph [5], which refers to the undesirability  of  permitting  the
      person concerned to  remain  in  the  UK  his  conduct,  character  or
      associations.  It continued:


             "You submitted the requested Questionnaire on the 05 May  2017
             detailing your previous earnings  and  Tax.   These  documents
             have been  considered  by  our  department  and  it  has  been
             concluded that  you  do  not  meet  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
             Immigration Rules.


             The Secretary of State has considered whether  the  particular
             circumstances of your case merit the exercise  of  discretion.
             Having considered these circumstances the Secretary  of  State
             is satisfied that the refusal remains appropriate and  is  not
             prepared to exercise discretion in your favour.


             Your actions in declaring different amounts of income to  HMRC
             and UKVI  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  in  light  of  your
             character and conduct it would be undesirable to allow you  to
             remain in the United Kingdom.    Your  character  and  conduct
             with regards to declaring your income would lead to a  refusal
             of your application under General Grounds Paragraph 322(5)  of
             the Immigration Rules. Whilst a refusal under Paragraph 322(5)
             is not a mandatory decision, it is considered your actions  in
             declaring different income to HMRC and UKVI would mean that  a
             refusal under Paragraph 322(5) is appropriate."


  25. The letter went on to say that  the  Applicant  did  not  qualify  for
      indefinite leave to remain under [245CD] of the Rules because  he  had
      been  refused  it  under  [322(5)].   Further  the  letter  said  that
      [245CD(g)] read with Appendix A required the  Applicant  to  score  80
      points to be awarded indefinite leave to remain and on the  income  he
      had declared he did not qualify.


  26. The Applicant sought an Administrative Review of this decision,  which
      was refused on 17 April 2018. The decision letter said that  the  fact
      that the Applicant had obtained a new accountant  and  retrospectively
      declared his earnings to HMRC:


             " ... is not sufficient to satisfy the Secretary of State that
             your earnings  are  as  a  result  from  engaging  in  genuine
             business activities.  Therefore as your  self  assessment  tax
             returns differ to the income to the income (sic)  declared  to
             Home Office places concerns on your character and conduct  and
             makes it undesirable for you to remain in the United Kingdom.


             You state your field of expertise is IT therefore you are  not
             expected to have a sound knowledge about tax and  accountancy.
             You contend you have always  relied  upon  the  help  of  your
             accountant.   However,  having  decided  to   undertake   self
             employed work in the United Kingdom it is your  responsibility
             to ensure the correct declaration of earnings are made to HMRC
             at the correct time, whether prepared  by  yourself  or  third
             party.  It is accepted that you would have had sight of  these
             documents prior to their submission to HMRC."


  27. It went on:


             "You  state  you  have  never  been  purposely  deceitful   or
             dishonest to the HMRC.   In  light  of  this  issue  you  have
             mentioned the case of Ozbogina and Tarasova (Deception  within
             paragraph 320(7B) Russia))  [2011]  UKUT  00197  (IAC)  it  is
             established (sic) that it necessary to show that deception  is
             deliberately made ...


             A review of the original caseworker's decision letter confirms
             that there were no direct accusations  of  dishonesty  against
             you.  Rather the original caseworker highlights concerns  over
             your character and conduct, essentially due to your failure to
             report your earnings and tax liability accurately to the  Home
             Office and HMRC.  Therefore, in light of Ozbogina and Tarasova
             we do not accept your assertion that there is a responsibility
             on the Home Office to establish that dishonesty and  deception
             was deliberately made, as no  accusation  was  raised  in  the
             first instance."

The parties' submissions on the application

  28. On behalf of the Applicant,  Mr  Lewis  challenges  the  Secretary  of
      State's decision on the basis that the facts as found did not  justify
      a refusal of indefinite leave to remain under [322(5)].  In summary he
      submits:

       a. For the Applicant to be disqualified from remaining under [322(5)]
          it must be shown that he has engaged in deliberate  wrongdoing  or
          dishonesty sufficient to make his continued  presence  in  the  UK
          undesirable.


       b. Mere carelessness or negligence on the part of  the  Applicant  is
          not enough to justify reliance on [322(5)].


       c. Taken together, the decision of 9 March 2018 and the review of  17
          April 2018 expressly disavowed any allegation of dishonesty by the
          Applicant.


       d. Thus, the Respondent was not  entitled  to  rely  on  [322(5)]  to
          refuse  the  Applicant  indefinite  leave  to  remain.    If   the
          Respondent wished to make  out  a  case  based  on  dishonesty  or
          deliberate wrongdoing then there had to be clear findings of  fact
          to that effect, and there were no such findings.

  29. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Malik submits that it was  for
      the Secretary of State to determine whether  the  Applicant's  conduct
      fell within [322(5)], and that it is not for me to substitute  my  own
      view of the evidence in order to reach my own findings  of  fact.   He
      reminds me that a judicial review is not a merits-based appeal  but  a
      determination whether the decision taken by  the  Secretary  of  State
      fell within the range of reasonable responses open to him, or  whether
      it contains an error of law properly material  to  the  outcome.    He
      submits that that Secretary  of  State  was  entitled  to  refuse  the
      Applicant's application under [322(5)] if he rationally concluded that
      he had not been honest and  transparent  in  relation  to  his  income
      either to HMRC in his tax returns or to the Secretary of State in  his
      applications for leave to remain.   Mr Malik says that for the reasons
      the Secretary of State gave, this finding of fact was open to him,  as
      was his  determination  that  that  finding  justified  refusal  under
      [322(5)] of the Rules.   The Upper Tribunal has considered the use  of
      [322(5)] of the Immigration Rules in cases of this nature on a  number
      of occasions: see eg R (Sultana) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
      Department [2018] UKAITUR JR/10580/2017 (UTJ Freeman); see R  (Samant)
      v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department   [2017]   UKAITUR
      JR/6546/2016 (Collins J); R (Varghase) v Secretary of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2017] JR/5167/2016 (Judge Kekic); R (Shahbaz Khan)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  UKUT  00384  (IAC)
      (Martin Spencer J), among other cases. He invites me  to  follow  this
      consistent line of authority in relation to cases concerning  [322(5)]
      and to dismiss the Applicant's claim.

Discussion


  30. It is convenient to begin by setting out [322(5)] of the Rules:


             "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation  of  leave  to
             enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  should  normally  be
             refused ...


             ...


             (5) the undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security; ..."


  31. The Secretary of State's published policy guidance on [322(5)] of  the
      Rules, so far as relevant, provides:


             "A person does not need to have been convicted of  a  criminal
             offence for this provision to apply. When deciding whether  to
             refuse under this category, the key thing to  consider  is  if
             there is reliable evidence to  support  a  decision  that  the
             person's behaviour calls into question their character  and/or
             conduct and/or their associations to the  extent  that  it  is
             undesirable to allow them to enter or remain in the  UK.  This
             may include cases where a migrant has  entered,  attempted  to
             enter or facilitated a  sham  marriage  to  evade  immigration
             control. If you are not sure  the  evidence  to  support  your
             decision is reliable, then  speak  to  your  line  manager  or
             senior caseworker."


  32. The factual scenario presented by the case before me is not new. As Mr
      Malik observed, there are a number of decisions of the Upper  Tribunal
      and other courts in which the application of [322(5)] of the Rules has
      been considered in circumstances where  the  Secretary  of  State  has
      refused leave to remain having concluded there has been dishonesty  by
      an applicant on the basis of discrepancies in income declared by  them
      on their application for  leave  to  remain  (where  it  is  to  their
      advantage under the Rules to have a higher income)  as  compared  with
      the income declared in their tax returns made to HMRC (where it is  in
      their interest to minimise their income): R (Samant)  v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department, JR/6546/2016, [3].   It is  a  frequent
      feature of such cases  that  the  applicant  denies  having  submitted
      dishonest figures and instead blames their accountant for the errors.


  33. It is clear from the cases  that  where  the  Secretary  of  State  is
      entitled on the facts to infer that the applicant has  been  dishonest
      in the presentation of his income then he  is  generally  entitled  to
      conclude pursuant to [322(5)] that it is undesirable for the applicant
      to remain in the UK.   However mere carelessness in  the  presentation
      of the figures, or even negligence, will not, in general, suffice: cf.
      Shahbaz Khan, supra, [35];  Dadzie and Parker-Wilson  v  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2018] CSOH 128, [27].  The way Mr Malik
      on behalf of the Secretary of State puts it in his  Skeleton  Argument
      at [23] is as follows:


             "... the Secretary of State is entitled to refuse  a  person's
             application under Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules if
             he rationally  concludes  that  he  has  not  been  honest  or
             transparent in relation to his income  either  with  the  Home
             Office or with HMRC. This is consistent with the text  of  the
             rule and the Secretary  of  State's  published  guidance.  The
             Secretary of State observes that an understanding of the  need
             to  deal  with  the  authorities  and  institutions  with  the
             requisite probity is a fundamental to  preserving  good  order
             and stability."

  34. Where the Secretary  of  State  finds  that  the  applicant  has  been
      dishonest then the issue on a judicial  review  challenge  is  whether
      that conclusion was  reasonably  available  to  him:  R  (Varghese)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department, JR/5167/2016,  [32].    It
      is not for the Upper Tribunal to  determine  for  itself  the  factual
      question of whether or not the applicant has been dishonest:  R (Giri)
      v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] 1 WLR 4418,  [19].




  35. Some of the relevant case law was recently reviewed by Martin  Spencer
      J in Shahbaz Khan, supra.  He said at [32]-[34]:


             "32. The starting point seems to me  to  be  that,  where  the
             Secretary of State discovers a significant difference  between
             the income claimed in a  previous  application  for  leave  to
             remain and the income declared  to  HMRC  (as  here),  she  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  However, it
             does not follow that, in all such cases, a decision to  refuse
             ILR will be lawful.  Where an Applicant has presented evidence
             to show that, despite the prima facie inference, he was not in
             fact dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary of  State
             is presented with a fact-finding task which  must  be  carried
             out fairly and lawfully.  In that regard, she needs to  remind
             herself that a finding that a person has  been  deceitful  and
             dishonest in relation to his tax affairs with the  consequence
             he is denied settlement in this  country  is  a  very  serious
             finding with serious consequences and therefore  the  evidence
             must be cogent and strong although, as the  authorities  show,
             the standard of proof remains on the balance of probabilities.




             33. It is further the  case,  in  my  judgment,  that  for  an
             applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for an "error"
             in relation to the historical tax return will not be  the  end
             of the matter.  Thus, the Secretary of State  is  entitled  to
             take into account that even where an accountant  has  made  an
             error, the accountant will or should have asked  the  taxpayer
             to confirm that the return was accurate and to have signed the
             tax return, and furthermore the Applicant will have  known  of
             his or her earnings and will have expected to pay tax thereon.
              Thus, in this case the Applicant did not pay  tax  of  almost
             �15,000 when he would have expected to do so and the Secretary
             of State is therefore entitled to ask why, put  on  notice  in
             this way that something was wrong, the "mistake" had not  been
             remedied earlier.


             34. Where an issue arises as to whether an error  in  relation
             to a tax return has been dishonest  or  merely  careless,  the
             Secretary of State would be not merely entitled but obliged to
             consider the evidence pointing in each direction and,  in  her
             decision,  justify  her  conclusion  by  reference   to   that
             evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the reasoning was
             rational and the evidence had been  properly  considered,  the
             decision of the Secretary of State could not be impugned ..."

  36. At [37] Martin Spencer J gave the following helpful  guidance  on  how
      the Secretary of State should go about his  decision  making  in  this
      scenario which, as I have said, is fairly common:


             "37. In order not to fall into the trap which I consider  that
             the Secretary of State (or those acting on  her  behalf)  fell
             into on this occasion, it may  assist  for  me  to  give  some
             guidance in relation  to  the  decision-making  process  where
             there have been discrepancies  between  previous  applications
             for Leave to Remain (with  points  claimed  on  the  basis  of
             earnings or profits) and tax  returns  which  have  been  made
             covering  the  same  period.   This  guidance  stems  from  my
             observations at paragraphs 32-34 above:


          i) Where there has been  a  significant  difference  between  the
             income claimed in a previous application for leave  to  remain
             and the income declared to HMRC, the  Secretary  of  State  is
             entitled to draw an inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful or dishonest and therefore he should be refused  ILR
             within paragraph 322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   I  would
             expect the Secretary of State to  draw  that  inference  where
             there is no plausible explanation for the discrepancy.


         ii) However, where an Applicant has  presented  evidence  to  show
             that, despite the prima facie inference, he was  not  in  fact
             dishonest but only careless, then the Secretary  of  State  is
             presented with a fact-finding task: she  must  decide  whether
             the explanation and evidence is sufficient, in  her  view,  to
             displace the prima facie inference of deceit/dishonesty.


        iii) In approaching that fact-finding task, the Secretary of  State
             should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is
             the 'balance of probability', a finding that a person has been
             deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with
             the consequence that he is denied settlement in  this  country
             is a very serious finding with serious consequences.


         iv)  However,  for  an  applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
             accountant for an 'error' in relation to  the  historical  tax
             return will not be the end of the matter: far from it.   Thus,
             the Secretary of State is entitled to take into account  that,
             even where an accountant has made  an  error,  the  accountant
             will or should have asked the tax payer to  confirm  that  the
             return was accurate and to have signed  the  tax  return,  and
             furthermore the Applicant  will  have  known  of  his  or  her
             earnings and will have  expected  to  pay  tax  thereon.   If,
             realising  this  (or  wilfully  shutting  his  eyes   to   the
             situation),  the  Applicant  has  not  taken  steps  within  a
             reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the  Secretary  of
             State may be entitled to conclude either that  the  error  was
             not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively,  the
             Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself justifies a
             conclusion that he has been has been  deceitful  or  dishonest
             and therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)
             of the Immigration Rules.


          v) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation to  a
             tax  return  has  been  dishonest  or  merely  careless,   the
             Secretary  of  State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence
             pointing in each direction and, in her decision,  justify  her
             conclusion  by  reference   to   that   evidence.   In   those
             circumstances, as long as the reasoning is  rational  and  the
             evidence has been properly considered,  the  decision  of  the
             Secretary of State cannot be impugned.


         vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State
             to consider in reaching her decision in these cases, including
             (but these are by no means exclusive):


             i. Whether the explanation for the error by the  accountant  is
                plausible;


            ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed to exist (for
                example,  correspondence  between  the  Applicant  and   his
                accountant at the time of the tax return) has been disclosed
                or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;


           iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that  an  error  had  been
                made because his liability to  pay  tax  was  less  than  he
                should have expected;


            iv. Whether, at any stage, the  Applicant  has  taken  steps  to
                remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken
                and the explanation for any significant delay.


        vii) In relation to any of the  above  matters,  the  Secretary  of
             State is likely to want to see evidence which goes beyond mere
             assertion:  for example, in a case such as the  present  where
             the explanation is that the Applicant was  distracted  by  his
             concern for his son's  health,  there  should  be  documentary
             evidence about the matter.  If there is, then the Secretary of
             State would need to weigh up whether  such  concern  genuinely
             excuses or explains the failure to  account  for  tax,  or  at
             least displaces the inference  that  the  Applicant  has  been
             deceitful/dishonest. The Secretary of State, before making her
             decision, should call for the  evidence  which  she  considers
             ought to exist, and may draw an  unfavourable  inference  from
             any failure on the part of the Applicant to produce it.


             (viii)  In  her  decision,  the  Secretary  of  State   should
             articulate her reasoning, setting out the  matters  which  she
             has taken into account in reaching her  decision  and  stating
             the reasons for the decision she has reached."






  37. Shahbaz Khan was followed in Dadzie and Parker-Wilson, supra, in which
      the Court of Session held:


           "[27] All of the above assumes, however, that the  falsification
           of one or other declaration of income was intentional. Where, in
           contrast, an incorrect income tax declaration was  made  because
           of carelessness or inadvertence, very  different  considerations
           would apply. A decision by the respondent to refuse ILR  because
           an incorrect tax return had been inadvertently  submitted  would
           be much more difficult to justify. That is  why,  as  Spencer  J
           observed in Khan, it is necessary for the respondent to  conduct
           a proper fact-finding process in  order  to  be  satisfied  that
           there has been  intentional  wrongdoing.  A  conclusion  that  a
           person has attempted either to evade tax or to  falsely  inflate
           his income for ILR purposes is a serious one,  with  potentially
           grave practical consequences if it results in refusal of  leave.
           The respondent must therefore be satisfied, on  the  balance  of
           probabilities, that an incorrect declaration (whichever  of  the
           two it might be) has been intentionally made. Where no plausible
           explanation is offered for the discrepancy, the respondent might
           reasonably conclude that there has been  an  intentional  under-
           declaration  of  income  to  HMRC.  The  fact  that  the  under-
           declaration has subsequently been corrected will not necessarily
           tip the balance in favour of the applicant,  especially  if  the
           correction took  place  at  or  around  the  same  time  as  the
           submission of an application  for  ILR.  As  mentioned  earlier,
           Appendix A to the Immigration Rules gives  express  notice  that
           the respondent may carry out a  process  of  verifying  previous
           earnings claims  with  declarations  made  to  other  government
           departments. The respondent might  well  form  the  view,  in  a
           particular case, that it was the prospect of such a verification
           exercise that prompted the correction, rather than a belated and
           unconnected  realisation  that  an  error  had  previously  been
           made...
           [29]  I  turn  now  to  apply  the  foregoing  analysis  to  the
           respondent's decision in the present case. As can be  seen  from
           the narrative earlier in this opinion, the decision  letter  set
           out, in turn, (i) the earnings claimed by the petitioner in  the
           preceding 12 months; (ii) the self-employed earnings claimed  by
           the petitioner in a previous application to UKVI; and (iii)  the
           lower self-employed earnings declared  to  HMRC  for  a  similar
           period. The letter then quoted the petitioner's answers  to  the
           questions put to him in  the  questionnaire.  On  the  foregoing
           basis, the writer of the letter concluded  that  the  petitioner
           had intentionally misrepresented his earnings to either HMRC  or
           UKVI.
           [30] In my opinion the mere fact  that  different  amounts  were
           declared to HMRC and to UKVI for one particular period  did  not
           constitute a  sufficient  basis  for  the  conclusion  that  the
           petitioner had acted dishonestly and  that  it  was  accordingly
           undesirable to grant him permission to remain. The  letter  does
           not contain any indication that  the  respondent  addressed  her
           mind  to  the  question  whether   the   discrepancy   indicated
           inadvertence on the one hand or intentional  wrongdoing  on  the
           other. No reason is given for the conclusion that  there  was  a
           deliberate under-statement or over-statement of income in one or
           other of the declarations. Although the petitioner had  earnings
           from self-employment in  other  years,  nothing  is  said  about
           these. The discrepancy  is  relatively  modest.  The  subsequent
           correction took place at the time of submission of a tax  return
           and not at the same time as the application for ILR.
           [31] In the circumstances of the present case,  one  would  have
           expected  the  respondent  to  explain  why  an   inference   of
           dishonesty was  to  be  drawn  despite  these  factors  and  the
           petitioner's statement that the under-declaration had  been  due
           to oversight. The respondent was not, of course, bound to accept
           that statement as plausible or satisfactory. But the  difficulty
           with the decision letter is that it does  not  demonstrate  that
           any consideration was given to  these  matters  at  all.  It  is
           further vitiated by the reference to an error by an  accountant:
           no such excuse had been put forward by the petitioner and  there
           is nothing in the papers to  indicate  that  an  accountant  was
           involved in the submission  of  the  incorrect  return.  In  the
           absence of any assessment  of  whether  there  was  evidence  of
           deliberate misdeclaration as  opposed  to  innocent  error,  the
           decision  was,  in  my  opinion,   unreasonable   according   to
           Wednesbury principles. It must therefore be reduced."
  38. The submission for the Applicant is that the decision to refuse ILR on
      the basis of [322(5)] of  the  Rules  was  based  essentially  on  the
      discrepancy in the figures provided by the Applicant to HMRC and  UKVI
      and that there was no finding of dishonesty  or  deception.   He  says
      this is apparent from, for example,  what  is  said  in  the  decision
      letter:
           "Your actions in declaring different amounts of income  to  HMRC
           and UKVI lead to the  conclusion  that  in  the  light  of  your
           character and conduct it would be undesirable to  allow  you  to
           remain in the United Kingdom.  Your character and  conduct  with
           regards to declaring your income would lead to a refusal of your
           application  under  General  Grounds  Paragraph  322(5)  of  the
           Immigration Rules. Whilst a refusal under  Paragraph  322(5)  of
           the Immigration  Rules  is  not  a  mandatory  decision,  it  is
           considered that your actions in declaring  different  income  to
           HMRC and UKVI would mean that a refusal under  Paragraph  322(5)
           is appropriate."

  39. He also relies on that part  of  the  Administrative  Review  decision
      which I have already quoted but which it  is  convenient  to  set  out
      again:

             "You  state  you  have  never  been  purposely  deceitful   or
             dishonest to the HMRC.   In  light  of  this  issue  you  have
             mentioned the case of Ozbogina and Tarasova (Deception  within
             paragraph 320(7B) Russia))  [2011]  UKUT  00197  (IAC)  it  is
             established (sic) that it necessary to show that deception  is
             deliberately made ...


             A review of the original caseworker's decision letter confirms
             that there were no direct accusations  of  dishonesty  against
             you.  Rather the original caseworker highlights concerns  over
             your character and conduct, essentially due to your failure to
             report your earnings and tax liability accurately to the  Home
             Office and HMRC.  Therefore, in light of Ozbogina and Tarasova
             we do not accept your assertion that there is a responsibility
             on the Home Office to establish that dishonesty and  deception
             was deliberately made, as no  accusation  was  raised  in  the
             first instance."


  40. I have considered the decision in Ozbogina and Tarasova  but  it  does
      not seem to me to be of any relevance.


  41. In my judgment this claim succeeds on the simple basis that  when  the
      initial decision letter and the  Administrative  Review  decision  are
      read together it is not possible to say that the  Secretary  of  State
      reached a clear conclusion that the Applicant had been  dishonest,  as
      opposed to something else.   The statement that the Secretary of State
      does 'not accept your assertion that there is a responsibility on  the
      Home  Office  to  establish  that   dishonesty   and   deception   was
      deliberately made' cannot be read as anything other than  a  disavowal
      by the Secretary of State that  dishonesty  is  not  necessary  before
      [322(5)] can be relied upon in this context. But, for  the  reasons  I
      have given, such a finding is essential if ILR is to be refused on the
      grounds of conduct pursuant to [322(5)].


  42. I am not saying that the Secretary of State must necessarily  use  the
      word 'dishonest' in his decision  letter,  although  if  that  is  his
      conclusion on applicant's state of mind that is what  he  should  say.
      What is necessary is that the facts found by the  Secretary  of  State
      should impel this inference as to the applicant's state of mind at the
      time he presented the figures to UKVI and/or HMRC.    For  example,  a
      finding in the following terms:  'You  intentionally  presented  false
      income figures to UKVI in support of an  application  for  ILR'  would
      impel  such  an  inference  because  intentionally  presenting   false
      information in such a context can be anything  other  than  dishonest.
      However, in the present case, although there are parts of the decision
      letter which contain findings which  might  possibly  on  one  reading
      allow such an inference to be drawn, when read against what is said in
      the Administrative Review, such a conclusion is  not  possible.     As
      the cases I have cited make clear, a finding of dishonesty is  a  very
      grave matter  indeed  with  serious  and  far  reaching  consequences.
      There is therefore no room for ambiguity.


  43. For these reasons,  this  claim  succeeds  and  the  decision  of  the
      Secretary of State is quashed.
