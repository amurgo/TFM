Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowing on human rights grounds  an  appeal  by  a
    citizen of Nigeria against a decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    refuse to vary his leave and to remove him from the United Kingdom.

 2. At paragraph 10 of the determination the First-tier Tribunal Judge says
    in terms: "I will not follow Gulshan  for  the  reasons  given  above."
    This is a reference to the reported decision of the Tribunal in Gulshan
    (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC)  which
    is a decision of Mr Justice Cranston sitting with Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Taylor.

 3. It is not the business of the First-tier Tribunal to decline to  follow
    decisions of the Upper Tribunal.  The decision is binding and it should
    have been followed. I fairness to the First-tier Tribunal Judge she has
    had more regard to the decision in Gulshan than this infelicitous might
    suggest but the failure to follow it is plainly an error of law.

 4. The decision in Gulshan has proved to be controversial for reasons that
    are not particularly plain to me.  There is a wealth  of  jurisprudence
    dealing with the application of Article 8 of the European Convention on
    Human Rights to immigration cases, both from this Tribunal, and perhaps
    more importantly from the Court of Appeal and beyond.

 5. All that is required in Gulshan is that the  Rules  introduced  by  the
    Secretary of State are taken seriously and are followed  systematically
    and are used to see if the circumstances of the person's  case  entitle
    them to remain.  Sometimes they will.  For  example,  people  who  have
    been in the United Kingdom for particularly long periods  of  time  may
    well be able to remain even if there is no other merit in their  cases.
    In many cases a person will not satisfy the requirements of  the  Rules
    but the exercise of following them through is a good  tool  to  analyse
    their case because it throws up the weak and strong points; weak in the
    sense of showing what they fail to do to meet the ordinary requirements
    of the Rules, strong in the sense that it may show up the circumstances
    that make the cases particularly compelling.

 6. This is precisely what the First-tier Tribunal Judge started to do. She
    has noted that the claimant is over 18 years old  and  under  25  years
    old, that he has not lived in the United Kingdom for 20 years,  and  he
    has not lived in the United  Kingdom  for  more  than  half  his  life.
    Neither did she accept that the claimant has lost ties with the country
    to which he would be sent.  This is explained at paragraph 5(4) of  the
    determination where the judge clearly concluded that the  claimant  has
    ties in the Ivory Coast and so cannot rely on paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of
    HC 395.

 7. All of these findings point to the claimant's  appeal  being  dismissed
    but the First-tier Tribunal Judge allowed the appeal.

 8. The decision is Gulshan does not claim to decide that all  cases  ought
    to be allowed solely with reference to the Rules.  What  Gulshan  makes
    plain is that where an appeal cannot be allowed under the main parts of
    the Rules then, absent out-of-the-ordinary circumstances, it cannot  be
    allowed properly. Ordinary circumstances are considered  fully  by  the
    Rules.  It  is  sometimes  said  that   there   must   be   "compelling
    circumstances not sufficiently recognised under  the  Rules"  or  "non-
    standard and particular features demonstrating that  removal  would  be
    unjustifiably harsh".

 9. The First-tier Tribunal Judge should have followed Gulshan  and  looked
    to see firstly if the claim should have been allowed  under  the  Rules
    (it can't) and then, secondly, if there were  compelling  circumstances
    or non-standard and  particular  features  demonstrating  that  removal
    would be unjustifiably harsh. This approach  might  have  been  in  the
    judge's mind but she did not spell it out.

10. The applicant is a young man.  He was born in January 1993  and  so  is
    just 21 years old.  He has been in the United Kingdom since he  arrived
    in 2005 when he was aged 12  years.   Although  he  is  a  national  of
    Nigeria he has never lived in that  country.  The  Secretary  of  State
    intends to return him to the Ivory Coast where he grew up.

11. This is not a case where he has any of the very strong elements to  his
    private and family life that weigh heavily in the  balancing  exercise.
    He is no doubt close to his immediate family in the United Kingdom  and
    may well regard his cousins as if they were his  brothers  and  sisters
    and may well regard his aunt and uncle as if  they  were  his  parents.
    The fact is that he is of  an  age  where  he  should  be  looking  for
    independent living and the relationships with his immediate family  are
    not relationships that carry much  weight  in  the  balancing  exercise
    absent circumstances of special dependency such as  extreme  disability
    of something of that kind which thankfully are not present here.

12. He does have a  close  relationship  with  a  girlfriend  and  that  is
    something which is part of his private and family life that is entitled
    to be respected.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge rejected the suggestion
    that they live together but they clearly spend a lot of  time  together
    and appear to have an intimate relationship. That  is  their  business.
    It is not uncommon for young people to live like that.

13. His girlfriend, for want of a better description, is of a  similar  age
    to the claimant.  She says that she hopes  they  will  marry  one  day.
    Perhaps they  will.   She  says  in  her  statement  that  she  has  no
    experience of life outside the United Kingdom.  That  might  be  right.
    There was nothing in  her  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  or  in  the
    claimant's evidence before the Tribunal that began  to  show  that  she
    could not settle with  him  in  the  Ivory  Coast.   Neither  is  there
    anything to show that in due  course  the  relationship  could  not  be
    rekindled and the appellant could return to the  United  Kingdom  as  a
    fiancï¿½ or a husband if that is how they chose to organise their private
    life.  There is nothing to indicate that this could not happen. This is
    not a deportation case. If the claimant leaves  promptly  he  will  not
    face a lengthy ban on returning to the United Kingdom.

14. It follows therefore that this is a case of  a  young  person  who  has
    spent quite a lot of his formative years in the United Kingdom  but  is
    not a United Kingdom national, who has no particular strong  ties  with
    the United Kingdom, whose removal would not disrupt  the  relationships
    that are highly protected, such as the relationship  between  a  parent
    and a minor child or a relationship between husband and  wife,  neither
    are there any unusual  or  exceptional  circumstances  which  begin  to
    satisfy the requirement for compelling circumstances features that make
    removal unjustifiably harsh.

15. If the First-tier Tribunal Judge had applied Gulshan properly the judge
    would have concluded that the claimant cannot satisfy the  requirements
    of the Rules but would also have concluded that there are none  of  the
    special circumstances necessary that make it right to allow the  appeal
    outside the Rules.

16. I am not surprised that special circumstances are  not  listed  in  the
    determination because they are just not present in this  appeal.   This
    is a case of a judge choosing to allow an appeal of  someone  for  whom
    the judge felt a degree of sympathy.  At one  level  I  can  understand
    that.  It is right that somebody is prepared to stand back and think  a
    little and ask if it is really necessary  to  remove  somebody  from  a
    country where he has grown up and spent much of his life to  a  country
    where he where he has no strong links, even though he clearly has ties.
    The fact is that there are a lot of people in those  circumstances  and
    in the absence of some compelling feature immigration control  requires
    such people to be removed or the whole idea  of  control  would  become
    meaningless.

17. Although I am going through papers looking for  things  to  assist  the
    claimant I cannot find  anything  that  would  justify  the  conclusion
    reached.  It follows therefore that  I  agree  with  the  Secretary  of
    State's grounds that the First-tier Tribunal failed to apply Gulshan in
    the way it should have been applied which is the way I  have  indicated
    above.

18. I have therefore reached the conclusion that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    has reached a decision that not open to it on the evidence and  I  have
    to set aside that decision and substitute the decision  dismissing  the
    claimant's appeal against the Secretary of State's decision.

19. I realise this would be exceedingly unwelcome to a person  who  thought
    that he had been successful and I have reminded myself of the need  not
    to substitute my judgment for the First-tier Tribunal's decision but to
    ask myself if the First-tier Tribunal's decision was right in law,  and
    for the reasons I have given I am persuaded  that  it  was  not  and  I
    therefore correct the error in the way that I have indicated.

20. I therefore allow the Secretary of State's appeal  against  the  First-
    tier Tribunal's decision. I set aside the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and I dismiss the claimant's appeal against the  Secretary  of
    State's decision.
