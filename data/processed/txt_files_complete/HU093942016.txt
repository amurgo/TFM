Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Thornhill, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I do not make an anonymity direction.

 2. The appellant is an Afghan national. He originally entered  the  United
    Kingdom on October 1, 2008 and claimed asylum. The  respondent  refused
    his claim and he appealed that decision to the First-tier Tribunal. The
    Tribunal dismissed his appeal on January  5,  2010  but  the  appellant
    remained in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

 3. Further submissions were lodged on October 16, 2012 and this led to him
    being granted limited leave to remain based on his relationship with  a
    British citizen and the fact that they had a child. This leave  expired
    on August 5, 2015. Shortly before  that  leave  expired  the  appellant
    lodged an application for further leave to remain as a parent  on  July
    20, 2015. His application was refused by the  respondent  on  March  2,
    2016 and Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Brookfield  (hereinafter
    called "the Judge") refused his appeal in  a  decision  promulgated  on
    February 20, 2017.  She dismissed  his  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    Rules and article 8 ECHR. On February 26, 2018 I heard submissions that
    the Judge had erred and I concluded that the Judge had erred by failing
    to give consideration to  the  Immigration  Directorate  Instruction  -
    Family Migration - Appendix  FM,  Section  1.0(B)  "Family  Life  as  a
    Partner or Parent and Private Life, 10 year Routes" and I adjourned the
    appeal for further submissions in light of the fact an  updated  Family
    Migration policy had been issued on February 21, 2018.

 4. I gave the appellant permission to adduce further evidence and  I  have
    had regard to a bundle containing a letter from the  school,  a  letter
    from a friend and  some  photographs  of  the  appellant  and  his  son
    together along with evidence of the appellant and his son  together  in
    hospital.

 5. The representatives agreed at the resumed hearing that no further  oral
    evidence was necessary.

 6. The two representatives agreed that the new policy brought  in  a  two-
    stage test. Firstly, the Tribunal had to consider whether  the  British
    child would have to leave the United Kingdom.

 7. They agreed that the first consideration, as set out on page 76 of  the
    new guidance, was to consider whether the child would have to leave the
    United Kingdom. If the child was not, or was not likely to, continue to
    live in the United Kingdom with another parent or  primary  carer  then
    section EX.1(a) of Appendix FM of the Immigration was likely to apply.

 8. Mr Bates thereafter submitted that as this was a case where  the  child
    would remain here with his mother and primary carer then  the  Tribunal
    had to consider whether in the round the removal of the  appellant  was
    appropriate in light of the all the circumstances of  the  case  taking
    into account the best interests of the child as a primary consideration
    and the impact on the child  of  the  appellant's  departure  from  the
    United  Kingdom.  If  the  Tribunal  considered  this  would  lead   to
    unjustifiable harsh consequences for the  appellant  and/or  the  child
    leave  would  fall  to  be  granted  on  the   basis   of   exceptional
    circumstances.

 9. Mr Thornhill did not agree with this approach and referred to pages  76
    and 77 of  the  aforementioned  guidance  which  said  that  where  the
    appellant had a very poor immigration history or a criminal record then
    only then would public interest considerations point to removal.

    AGREED FACTS

10. Following the dismissal of  his  asylum  appeal  in  January  2010  the
    appellant  remained  illegally  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  began  a
    relationship which led to his son being conceived. His son was born  on
    [ ] 2012 and is a British citizen and is now aged 5 ï¿½ years of age.

11. Based on his relationship with the child and mother the  appellant  was
    granted leave to remain until August 5, 2015. Shortly after  succeeding
    with this application the appellant and child's  mother  separated  and
    his application to extend his current application is  based  solely  on
    the fact that he was the parent of a British Citizen child.

12. On February 13, 2017  the  appellant  obtained,  by  consent,  a  Child
    Arrangements Order  allowing  him  unsupervised  contact  every  Sunday
    between the hours of 11 AM and 6 PM and during the school holidays on a
    Tuesday between the hours of 12 PM and  6  PM.  His  witness  statement
    dated January 30, 2017 indicates that whilst his relationship with  the
    child's mother had broken down in 2013 he continued to see his  son  at
    her home. The appellant continues to see his son and recently  attended
    with him when he was in hospital for one day.

13. The appellant spoke  English  and  worked.  He  did  claim  any  public
    benefits and that there were no negative findings under section 117B of
    the 2002 Act. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act  applies.  The  appellant
    does not have a very poor immigration history or a criminal record.

    FINDINGS

14. The appellant is seeking to be granted leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom on the basis that he is the parent of a British citizen. He had
    come to the United Kingdom and claimed asylum and  it  was  only  after
    that claim was refused that he then  sought  leave  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom on the basis that he was in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his partner and that they had a child. Shortly  after
    being granted that leave he and his partner separated so when  he  came
    to make a further application for leave to remain his  application  was
    based solely on the basis that he was the parent of a British child.

15. The appellant did not meet the Immigration Rules when  his  appeal  was
    first considered and it seems the case today that in order to meet  the
    Immigration Rules the appellant would have to rely on Section  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

16. The child has always lived with his mother and the appellant has  lived
    apart from his son since 2013 although it  seems  agreed  that  he  has
    continued to see his son throughout this period  and  he  now  has  the
    benefit of a Court Order.

17. The child's mother is a British national and she is the  primary  carer
    and I can see no situation where this child would ever be  required  to
    leave the United Kingdom. This is a case where the relationship between
    the appellant and the child's  mother  broke  down  shortly  after  the
    appellant was granted leave to remain in 2013 and the mother  has  been
    the primary carer since that time.

18. The respondent's new guidance makes clear that  only  in  circumstances
    where it was likely the child would have to leave  the  United  Kingdom
    would Section EX.1 of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules be engaged.

19. The case therefore falls to be considered outside  of  the  Immigration
    Rules. Mr Bates argued that the guidance, whilst not law, sets out  the
    respondent's approach to the legislation and he submits that  as  there
    is no likelihood of the child leaving  the  United  Kingdom  the  issue
    ultimately comes down to whether it would  be  unjustifiably  harsh  to
    require the appellant to leave the United Kingdom. Mr Thornhill, whilst
    acknowledging the guidance placed a different twist on the legislation,
    submitted that unless  the  appellant  had  a  "very  poor  immigration
    history" or  a  criminal  record  then  it  would  not  be  reasonable,
    according to the guidance, to require the appellant to leave the United
    Kingdom.

20. I have considered both arguments and I have also  considered  the  full
    content of the latest guidance which applies in this appeal.

21. The respondent's  position,  as  set  out  in  the  2018  guidance,  is
    different to the position set  out  in  the  2015  guidance.  Mr  Bates
    submitted the previous policy had been badly worded and  it  had  never
    been the respondent's intention that being  the  parent  of  a  British
    child meant an appeal must succeed unless that person had a  very  poor
    immigration history or a criminal record. If such an approach had  been
    intended then virtually every article 8 parent claim would succeed.

22. It seems to me that this is what the Tribunal has been faced with since
    the introduction of the 2015  policy  and  it  therefore  comes  as  no
    surprise that the latest policy switches the  emphasis  away  from  the
    appellant and places the emphasis on whether the child was at  risk  of
    having to leave the United Kingdom.

23. The appellant cannot argue that this child would be removed and I agree
    with the submissions advanced by Mr Bates that if the child is  not  at
    risk of removal then there is no longer a  presumption,  as  previously
    appeared to be the case, that the child's father would  be  allowed  to
    remain unless he had a very poor  immigration  history  or  a  criminal
    record.

24. This does not mean that the appellant cannot succeed  in  this  current
    application but what it  does  mean  is  that  there  is  no  longer  a
    presumption that he must be allowed to stay purely  because  he  has  a
    child who is British.

25. Applying Section 117B of the 2002 Act I  accept  the  appellant  speaks
    English,  has  been  in  gainful  employment  and  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship with his son. Section 117B(6) of the  2002  Act
    makes clear that where the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with his child and it would not be  reasonable  to  expect
    the child to leave the United Kingdom the  public  interest  would  not
    require his removal. The respondent's  updated  policy  reinforces  the
    point that the child will not be expected to leave the United Kingdom.

26. Mr Thornhill submitted that  if  he  met  the  requirements  for  entry
    clearance it would be disproportionate to  require  him  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.  As  things  currently  stand  he  does  not  meet  the
    requirements for entry clearance as he does not  have  the  appropriate
    English-language certificate. It had of course  been  open  to  him  to
    obtain such a certificate bearing in mind the length  of  time  he  has
    been here but for whatever reason he has not  chosen  to  take  such  a
    test. Mr Thornhill submitted he would clearly pass the test and  whilst
    that may be the case the fact  remains  he  has  not  at  the  date  of
    hearing.

27. The appellant came  to  this  country  seeking  asylum  and  when  that
    application was rejected he became an overstayer and the only reason he
    was allowed to remain in the country was due to the relationship he had
    with his child's mother and  the  fact  that  they  had  a  child.  The
    appellant and his partner separated shortly after he received his leave
    which meant the only basis the appellant could  extend  his  leave  was
    based on his relationship with his son.

28. The appellant's immigration status is  precarious  because  he  has  no
    permanent status in this country. Until such  time  as  he  is  granted
    indefinite leave to remain he must always comply with  the  Immigration
    Rules. The fact he does not meet the Rules is a factor I must take into
    account  because  the  public  interest  requires  the  maintaining  of
    immigration control.

29. Merely having a British citizen child is  insufficient.  The  fact  the
    appellant's child and his mother are British citizens  gives  them  the
    right to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  but  it  does  not  give  the
    appellant the right to remain in the United Kingdom.

30. The issue is one of proportionality and Section 117B (1)  of  the  2002
    Act requires me to have regard to the public  interest.  The  appellant
    has the option of meeting the Immigration Rules  and  if  so  would  be
    entitled to make a formal entry clearance application. That is a factor
    I must have regard to.

31. Having considered all the above factors I have concluded that it  would
    not be disproportionate to require the appellant to  leave  the  United
    Kingdom.

    DECISION

32. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision.

33. I have remade the decision and dismissed the  appeal  on  human  rights
    grounds.
