For the Appellant:     Mr RD, Sponsor
For the Respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Venezuela born in July 1990. He applied
       for entry clearance to come to the UK as the same sex  partner  of  a
       British citizen, whom he later married in Denmark  on  19th  December
       2018. The respondent refused the application made on 26th  June  2018
       on 27th September 2018.  His appeal against the decision was  decided
       on the papers and dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Hobson in  a
       determination promulgated on the 29th May 2019.

    2. The appellant was refused a request for  expedition  of  the  hearing
       before the First-tier Tribunal on 22nd March 2019  by  Judge  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal Kaler, but this was later done administratively.

    3. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge McWilliam on
       15th September 2019 on the basis that it was arguable that the First-
       tier judge had erred in law  as  there  was  an  arguable  procedural
       irregularity as it was arguably unclear which date the appellant  had
       to serve his bundle by.

    4. The matter  came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    5. The grounds of appeal argue that the appellant, who acts  in  person,
       did not have a fair hearing because it is contended that  the  First-
       tier Tribunal did not  place  all  of  the  192  pages  of  documents
       supplied by the appellant by special delivery on 30th May 2019 (which
       had been filed in  this  way  as  he  could  not  email  them  as  an
       attachment due to the size of  the  bundle)  before  the  Judge,  and
       instead the Judge only had  the  documents  lodged  with  the  appeal
       notice  and  some  evidence  submitted  on  8th  January  2019.   The
       appellant did not believe that the case would be heard  on  29th  May
       2019 due to an assurance  by  First-tier  Tribunal  staff,  and  thus
       believed that his full  evidence  would  be  before  the  Judge.  The
       evidence filed on 30th May 2019 would  have  addressed  the  concerns
       that led to the dismissal of the appeal.

    6. Ms Everett  accepted  for  the  respondent  that  there  has  been  a
       procedural unfairness amounting to an error of law,  in  relation  to
       the full documents not being before the First-tier Tribunal Judge who
       determined the appeal, in light of what was said in the HM  Courts  &
       Tribunals Service letter of 2nd September 2019.

    7. I explained to the sponsor that there  was  an  option,  which  would
       normally be followed, that the case was remitted for hearing de  novo
       before the First-tier Tribunal, but that there  was  also  an  option
       that we would remake the hearing immediately. The sponsor  said  that
       he wished to proceed immediately with the remaking.  Ms  Everett  was
       also happy to proceed with the remaking,  but  I  gave  her  time  to
       peruse the large bundle of documents lodged by the  appellant  before
       we commenced the remaking hearing. At  the  end  of  that  hearing  I
       informed the sponsor that I would allow the appeal but that  I  would
       set out my full reasons in writing.

Conclusions - Error of Law

    8. There is conclusively evidence supporting the appellant's  contention
       that he was told his case would not be heard until 30th May 2019,  in
       the form of a letter  of  2nd  September  2019  from  the  HM  Courts
       Customer Investigation Team which  accepts  that  the  appellant  was
       misled into believing that he could submit his bundle by  post  in  a
       timely way by sending it to arrive on the 30th May 2019, when in fact
       by so doing it could not have reached the judge in time.  The  letter
       offers an ex gratia payment of �100 as a goodwill  gesture  for  this
       error. In these circumstances I find  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       hearing  was  procedurally  unfair  as  material  evidence,  properly
       submitted, was not considered.

Evidence and Submissions - Remaking

    9. At the start of the remaking hearing I clarified  the  issues.  There
       were two issues raised as a result of the refusal:  it  was  said  in
       the refusal that there was insufficient evidence that  the  appellant
       and his partner had met, and that they therefore could not  therefore
       meet the eligibility requirement at paragraph E-ECP 2.5  of  Appendix
       FM to the Immigration Rules. Secondly, even if this requirement  were
       satisfied, the appellant and his sponsor had  not  shown  that  their
       relationship was genuine and subsisting and  that  they  intended  to
       live together permanently in  the  UK,  and  thus  could  not  fulfil
       paragraphs E-ECP 2.6 and 2.10  of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
       Rules. The suitability, financial and English  language  requirements
       were accepted as being met in the refusal.

   10. There was no objection  from  the  respondent  to  the  admitting  of
       further evidence updating the progress of the relationship  from  May
       2019 to the present, and so I have admitted that evidence as  clearly
       it could not have been lodged previously, it was properly  served  on
       the respondent, and assists the Upper Tribunal in the remaking of the
       appeal.

   11. The appellant and his partner met online in May 2018, but they  first
       met in person on 29th June 2018 in Buenos Aires. This is supported by
       the evidence of the sponsor, passport stamps, airline  documents  and
       room booking documents, this date is three days after the  submission
       of the application but well before the  decision.  It  is  clearly  a
       requirement of the Immigration Rules at Appendix FM  E-ECP  2.5  that
       the couple must have met but it is not said in the Immigration  Rules
       that this has to be so at the date of application, in  contrast,  for
       instance, to the requirement that the couple are over the age  of  18
       years. Ms Everett indicated that she accepted that the requirement to
       have met in person had to be satisfied at the date of decision  under
       the Rules, and that she was satisfied on the evidence that  this  had
       taken place. As such the only issue that needed to be determined  was
       whether the relationship was genuine and subsisting, and whether  the
       couple intended to live together permanently.

   12. The sponsor confirmed his name and address and that  the  information
       in the document "Appellant's Reply to ECM Appeal Review" at  pages  9
       to 23 of the bundle was  true  and  correct.  In  short  summary  the
       evidence in the bundle and given orally is as follows. The  appellant
       and sponsor met via the www.badoo.com online dating  website  in  May
       2018. They have been video chatting everyday using WhatsApp and  also
       use a phone services Rebtel and Movistar, and met in person  for  the
       first time in Buenos Aires  on  29th  June  2018.  The  sponsor  then
       visited the appellant and met his parents in Venezuela in July  2018.
       The couple were married in Denmark on 19th  December  2018,  and  had
       their honeymoon in Paris. They chose  to  marry  in  Denmark  as  the
       sponsor wished to visit that country  and  had  never  done  so.  The
       sponsor accepts that their relationship developed quickly.  They  met
       again in person again in Madrid in August 2019. The sponsor does  not
       wish to make their home in Venezuela because of the  difficulties  in
       that country, and also due to  his  family  and  religious  community
       responsibilities in the UK.  The sponsor has a good friend  who  have
       written a letter of  support  confirming  that  the  relationship  is
       genuine, but he did not think it was necessary to bring him  to  give
       evidence before the Upper Tribunal. The  sponsor  and  appellant  are
       committed to live together permanently  as  a  married  couple  in  a
       shared home, and are making  joint  decisions  about  the  d�cor  and
       fittings.

   13. Ms Everett submitted that whilst the original  refusal  and  the  ECM
       review gave reasonable reasons  for  refusing  there  was  perhaps  a
       failure to deal with the substance of the evidence submitted, and she
       accepted that she could not properly  make  any  further  submissions
       given the wealth of evidence before the Upper Tribunal.

   14. Mr RD submitted that the appeal should be allowed because there was a
       large amount of evidence which showed that his relationship with  the
       appellant was genuine; that  they  were  planning  their  joint  home
       together; that they had been in continuous contact via social  media;
       and that they had  spent  time  face  to  face  with  three  holidays
       together in Argentina, Denmark/France and Spain.

   Conclusions - Remaking

   15. As indicated above I find that the requirement to have met in  person
       at the date of decision at paragraph E-ECP 2.5 of Appendix FM to  the
       Immigration Rules is met because the appellant and Mr DM had  met  in
       Buenos Aires between 29th June 2018 and 7th July 2018.  This  meeting
       was confirmed by the evidence of Mr RD, which I found to be  entirely
       straight forward and credible, and is supported  by  documents  which
       relate to the booking and payment for the hotel, passport stamps  and
       airline documents including boarding passes.

   16. I also find that the appellant and sponsor are, and were at the  date
       of  decision,  in  a  genuine   and   subsisting   relationship   and
       intend/intended to live together permanently due to the detailed  and
       extensive documentary evidence submitted in support  of  this,  along
       with the confirmatory oral evidence of the sponsor.

   17. The WhatsApp messages between the  appellant  and  sponsor  span  the
       period 22nd May 2018 to 4th October 2019 and show  intense  messaging
       and video calls in this period with overtly  romantic  content  which
       references the trips the couple have made  together,  their  wedding,
       birthdays and plans  for  their  life  together  in  the  UK.   I  am
       satisfied that they married in  Denmark  on  19th  December  2018  in
       Denmark, and that  they  have  spent  time  on  holiday  together  in
       Denmark/Paris between 13th December 2018 and 23rd December  2018  and
       in Madrid between the 30th August and 7th September 2019 (as evidence
       by the sponsor's evidence, passport stamps, airline tickets and hotel
       bookings). There is also a significant amount of email  and  WhatsApp
       evidence showing the couple making  arrangements  for  their  marital
       home with respect to fittings etc, and also a letter from the sponsor
       friend, Mr SM,  and  the  appellant's  parents  confirming  that  the
       appellant and sponsor are in a genuine relationship.

   18. As such I am satisfied that the appellant and  sponsor  met  all  the
       requirements of  the  relevant  Immigration  Rules  at  the  time  of
       decision, and continue to do so. I find that  the  refusal  of  entry
       clearance interferes with their right to respect for family life, and
       that this interference is disproportionate to the legitimate  aim  as
       the appellant  can,  and  did  at  the  time  of  decision,  met  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules in all respects and so there is
       no public interest in the appellant being excluded from the  UK.  The
       appellant speaks English and will be financially self-sufficient,  as
       he has shown that he meets  these  requirements  of  the  Immigration
       Rules.

Decision:

    1. The making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
       making of an error on a point of law.

    2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

    3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it on Article 8 ECHR
       grounds.



Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the  original
appellant. This direction applies  to,  amongst  others,  all  parties.  Any
failure to comply with this direction could give rise to contempt  of  court
proceedings. I do so in order to avoid a potential of harm  arising  to  the
sponsor due to the views of his family and religious community with  respect
to his entering a same-sex relationship.
