For the Appellant:     Mrs H Price, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1.   The appellant is a citizen of Egypt born on 1 February 1981, who has
      appealed with the permission of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  against  a
      decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Quigley,  who  dismissed
      his appeal against a decision of the respondent to refuse to  issue  a
      residence card as confirmation of a right of residence as  the  family
      member or extended family member of an EEA national exercising  Treaty
      rights.


   2.   The appellant appears to have entered  the  UK  in  around  November
      2009. Since  then  he  has  been  refused  a  residence  card  on  six
      occasions. On 1 October  2012  he  was  refused  because  his  claimed
      spouse's Slovakian ID card had been  reported  stolen.  The  appellant
      made his most recent  application  on  15  October  2012  through  the
      offices of his former representative, Mr T  S  Chodha.  The  appellant
      again claimed to be the family member (spouse) of Ms Ivana  Kari?kov�,
      a Slovakian national born on 29  June  1986.  It  was  stated  in  the
      application form that she worked for Mr Mohamed Al Masri  (trading  as
      "MNH  Fashion")  earning  �121.60  per  week  and  that  her  job  was
      permanent. Documents were submitted suggesting the couple  married  in
      Cairo on 23 September 2008. Ms Kari?kov�'s passport, issued  in  March
      2011, was submitted with the application. The respondent  refused  the
      application because it had not been possible to contact Ms Kari?kov�'s
      claimed employer, the employment letter was not on  headed  paper  and
      there were discrepancies in the  pay  slips.  There  was  insufficient
      evidence to show she was a qualified  person.  The  Egyptian  marriage
      document had previously been found to be not as issued.  The  evidence
      showing cohabitation was considered. There was only  one  document  in
      the  name  of  Ms  Kari?kov�  and  none  in  joint  names.  There  was
      insufficient evidence to show they were in a durable relationship. The
      letter also considered the rules relating to article 8  of  the  Human
      Rights Convention.


   3.    The appellant's grounds of appeal asserted he is the family  member
      of an EEA national  and  removing  him  would  breach  article  8.  He
      requested his appeal  be  determined  on  the  papers.  Judge  Quigley
      considered the documents. She noted the appellant had  stated  in  his
      application form that Ms Kari?kov� was employed whereas his claim  was
      now that she was self-employed and had been since 2011. She considered
      the appellant's responses to the reasons for refusal but concluded the
      burden  of  proof,  which  rested  on  the  appellant,  had  not  been
      discharged.


   4.   The appellant sought permission to appeal, arguing the  judge  erred
      by  failing  to  consider  the  evidence  and  merely  endorsing   the
      respondent's reasons for refusal. Permission to appeal was granted  by
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Astle because  it  was  arguable  the
      judge had failed  to  give  adequate  consideration  to  the  evidence
      submitted on behalf of the appellant. The respondent has filed a  rule
      24 response opposing  the  appeal.  This  notes  that  Ms  Kari?kov�'s
      financial statement for the tax year 2012 to 2013 had  been  submitted
      but this was insufficient to  show  that  she  was  exercising  Treaty
      rights.


   5.   I heard submissions as to whether the  judge  had  made  a  material
      error of law. Mrs Price was  concerned  that  she  had  not  seen  the
      respondent's bundle or the grounds seeking permission to appeal  so  I
      provided her with a  copy  of  them.  I  explained  to  her  that  the
      appellant's bundle, which she had a copy of, had not  been  lodged  at
      the First-tier Tribunal. The judge only  had  witness  statements  and
      some original documents before her. I showed these to  Mrs  Price.  In
      her submissions, she relied chiefly on evidence which  she  understood
      had been filed showing the appellant had been  granted  an  EA  family
      permit in order to enter the UK as the family member of  Ms Kari?kov�.
      I noted that. Mrs Price did not pursue an adjournment application.


   6.    The reason Mrs Price felt the family  permit  was  significant  was
      that the refusal letter had noted that, in  the  appellant's  previous
      application made on 21 September 2012, he submitted the same  Egyptian
      marriage document which was found not to be  "as  issued".  The  judge
      simply reproduced this in her determination even  though  no  evidence
      had been submitted on the point by the respondent.  Mr  Avery  pointed
      out that the appellant had had two previous unsuccessful appeals.


   7.   Mrs Price said she was prepared to deal with  the  financial  issue,
      which I took to mean whether the appellant had shown that Ms Kari?kov�
      was a qualified person. It is clear from the notice of  decision  that
      this was  the  primary  reason  for  refusal.  She  argued  there  was
      sufficient material before the  judge  to  find  Ms  Kari?kov�  was  a
      qualified person and the judge had  erred  by  failing  to  take  into
      account all the evidence. She  had  not  given  adequate  reasons  for
      rejecting the evidence. Mrs Price also  argued  the  judge  had  given
      insufficient reasons for finding the couple  were  not  in  a  durable
      relationship.


   8.   Mr Avery agued the judge had not made a material error  of  law  and
      her decision should stand. She had set out the evidence in paragraph 7
      of her determination and given reasons for rejecting it  in  paragraph
      11. She was perfectly entitled to reach the conclusion she reached.


   9. I  find  there  is  no  material  error  of  law  in  Judge  Quigley's
      determination. The key issue was whether Ms Kari?kov� was a  qualified
      person. As noted, the appellant did not file a  complete  bundle.  The
      judge noted in paragraph 7 that the appellant  had  submitted  various
      documents and witness statements. She noted the evidence  had  changed
      and that the appellant now said his wife  worked  as  a  self-employed
      cleaner in addition to working for MNH Fashion.  The  judge  noted  in
      particular that trading accounts had  been  provided  for  the  period
      March  2012  to  March  2013.  The   following   paragraphs   of   the
      determination show that the judge felt the change of evidence was very
      significant. There had been  no  mention  of  self-employment  in  the
      application and, following the refusal, which  was  in  large  measure
      based  on  an  inability  to  verify   Ms  Kari?kov�'s  employment,  a
      different case was made that she was self-employed and had been  since
      2011. The judge noted the appellant's attempt to explain why telephone
      calls made to MNH Fashion were not picked  up  and  rejected  it.  The
      judge went on to note, in paragraph 12, that  there  were  unexplained
      discrepancies in the pay slips which the appellant had produced.


  10. In fairness to the appellant, it is right to point out that the  judge
      did not comment on the letter he provided  from  Leadenhall  Financial
      Management Ltd commenting on the rates of pay and the  change  in  the
      National Minimum Wage,  although  it  does  not  deal  with  what  the
      respondent regarded as discrepancies in the figures for total pay. The
      judge did not comment in detail on those  either.  Paragraph  12  does
      therefore given the impression the judge was endorsing the reasons for
      refusal without assessing the evidence for  herself.  This  impression
      was compounded by paragraph 13, which simply notes what  was  recorded
      about the  marriage  documents  without  acknowledging  the  fact  the
      appellant had submitted evidence from the Consulate  addressing  this.
      Nor does the judge  note  what  the  appellant  said  in  his  witness
      statement about gaining  a  family  permit  on  the  strength  of  the
      marriage.


  11. However, on the primary issue of whether the appellant had  discharged
      the burden of proving Ms Kari?kov� was a qualified person,  the  judge
      was entitled to make the finding she made for the reasons she gave  in
      paragraphs 8 to 11. The appellant had fundamentally shifted the  basis
      of his application in the manner described and, having chosen to  have
      his appeal determined on the papers, gave no opportunity  for  any  of
      the evidence to be tested. The judge's  conclusion  was  rational  and
      based on the evidence. Her reasons were adequate. The appeal was bound
      to be dismissed.


  12. It follows that any error concerning the validity of the marriage  was
      immaterial to the outcome of the appeal. There is a further reason why
      any error was immaterial. The marriage documents in question show that
      the  appellant's  marriage  to  Ms  Kari?kov�  was  conducted  through
      proxies. The  Upper  Tribunal  has  now  clarified  in  Kareem  (Proxy
      marriages  -  EU  law)  [2014]  UKUT  00024  (IAC)   that   in   those
      circumstances, the  appellant  had  to  show  that  his  marriage  was
      recognised under Slovakian law. That is the law  whether  or  not  the
      issue was raised in the reasons for refusal letter.  No  evidence  has
      been provided by the appellant on this issue and  therefore  he  could
      not have demonstrated that he was a family member for the purposes  of
      his application for a residence card.


  13. Mrs Price also challenged the  judge's  assessment  of  the  issue  of
      whether the couple were in a durable  relationship.  The  reasons  for
      refusal letter  noted  the  appellant  had  provided  some  documents.
      However, they were not considered sufficient. He provided 7 documents,
      such as bills and bank statements dating back to 2010, in his name and
      only one document in Ms Kari?kov�'s name from  April  2011.  No  joint
      documents were submitted. In paragraph 14 the judge  simply  says  she
      has studied the documents provided in support of the  appeal  and  she
      remained "far from satisfied"  that  the  couple  were  in  a  durable
      relationship. No other reasons  are  given  and  the  judge  does  not
      describe the documents which were submitted.


  14. I have carefully considered the documents. There are  still  no  joint
      documents. The majority of the documents are what might  be  described
      as  marketing  materials  and  there  is  an  absence  of  significant
      documents, such as  bank  statements  or  official  correspondence  in
      respect of Ms Kari?kov�. There is a single BT bill  for  Ms  Kari?kov�
      going back to May 2011. Otherwise the  documents  are  all  relatively
      recent.


  15. The judge's conclusion, albeit somewhat  briefly  expressed,  was  one
      which it was open to her to reach. There is no material error  in  her
      decision.

     The Judge of the First-tier Tribunal did not make a material error  on
