For the Appellant:     Mrs Shafait Bibi Khan (Sponsor)
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwncyz, a Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Farhan Ali, was born on 3 July 1993 and is a citizen  of
    Pakistan.  He applied to enter the United Kingdom as a  spouse  of  the
    sponsor (Mrs Shafait Bibi Khan) whose application was  refused  by  the
    Entry Clearance Officer on 17 April 2013.  The  appellant  appealed  to
    the First-tier Tribunal (Judge R Caswell)  which,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 24 February 2014, dismissed the appeal.   The  appellant
    now appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. Granting permission,  Judge  Adio  limited  the  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on Article 8 ECHR grounds only.  In  granting  permission,  he
    noted:

         Having decided to consider Article 8 as an obvious point  and  make
         very positive findings about the sponsor and  the  desire  of  both
         parties to very much  want  to  live  together,  the  judge  should
         arguably  have  assessed  proportionality  and  given  sufficiently
         reasoned findings particularly  as  the  maintenance  threshold  of
         �18,600 under the Rules had been satisfied.

 3. Judge Caswell had  noted  that  "All  the  indications  are  that  [the
    sponsor] earns over �18,600 gross per year" but she  had  not  provided
    "the required documents" in order to prove that as a fact.  As  regards
    Article 8 Judge Caswell wrote [10]:

         There was no appeal on Article  8  grounds  but  I  considered  the
         position nonetheless.  The appellant cannot succeed in any  Article
         8 appeal under Appendix FM to the Rules since he does not meet  the
         tests there.   I  considered  whether  there  were  'arguably  good
         grounds' for saying that there are  'compelling  circumstances  not
         sufficiently recognised under the Rules' in this  case,  but  could
         not find that there were.  I  accept  that  the  sponsor  had  been
         working very hard and the couple very much want to live together as
         husband and wife in the UK, but there are not  exceptional  matters
         should as to lead to assessment of the position under  the  general
         Article 8 case law.  In the circumstances, any appeal on Article  8
         grounds fails also.

 4. Judge Caswell directed herself at [7] to  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Gulshan [2013] UKUT 640.  The judge was clearly of the view
    that "very much wanting to live together as husband and wife in the UK"
    did not amount to an exceptional matter such as to lead her to consider
    Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration Rules.  Although  she  does  not
    mention it, it is also clear that the fact that the sponsor appeared to
    earn in excess of the income required by the Immigration Rules likewise
    did not amount to an exceptional circumstance.  I do not find that  her
    judgment is arguably wrong in law.  As acknowledged  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in MF [2013] EWCA Civ 1192,  the  Immigration  Rules  concerning
    Article 8 constitute a complete code and is likely  that  only  appeals
    with very unusual or compelling circumstances not  anticipated  by  the
    provisions of the Rules are likely to  succeed  under  Article  8  ECHR
    outside of the Rules.  There is nothing about the circumstances of this
    appeal which would call into question the judge's  reasoning  or  which
    might indicate that she has misapplied Gulshan and MF. Nothing has been
    put before us which  requires  the  Upper  Tribunal  to  revisit  Judge
    Caswell's decision.  In the circumstances,  the  appeal  is  dismissed.
    There is, of course, nothing to prevent the appellant making a  further
    application especially in light of the fact that  the  sponsor  is  now
    aware of the documentary evidence which she must produce to  prove  her
    income.  However, that is a matter for the appellant, the  sponsor  and
    their advisers.

DECISION

 5.  This appeal is dismissed.
