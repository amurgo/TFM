                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In respect of this matter the Appellant's appeal had  been  listed  for
    hearing on 15 July 2015 at Hatton Cross.  The  case  was  to  be  heard
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Wright.  Mr Bellara of Counsel  had  attended
    before the Judge but there was  no  representation  on  behalf  of  the
    Secretary of State. It does not appear that any reason was provided  as
    to why the Secretary of State was not represented at that hearing.

2.   As my extempore decision will show, a difficulty arose, indeed  a  very
    significant difficulty arose at that hearing.  The  Appellant  had  not
    attended the hearing.   The First-tier Tribunal Judge  at  paragraph  8
    refers to what appears to have happened on the day and he said in  part
    as follows:

         "The matter eventually proceeded to full hearing in  the  afternoon
         (submissions  only)  following  refusal  of  Mr   Bellara's   brief
         adjournment application based  on  the  Appellant's  non-attendance
         (application  not  supported   by   any   medical   evidence   from
         A&E/Whitechapel Hospital or from  the  Appellant's  GP  or  to  his
         claimed unfitness to attend the Tribunal [see  Western  Solicitors'
         letter of 15 July 2015 based  on  a  text  message].   Despite  the
         matter initially being put back in the last until after  lunch  and
         then again and  Mr  Bellara's  finally  request  until  3  pm,  the
         Tribunal being satisfied after  careful  consideration  of  Rule  2
         overriding objective and parties' obligations to cooperate with the
         Tribunal together with  Rule  4  Case  Management   Powers  of  the
         Tribunal  Procedure  First-tier  Tribunal  Immigration  and  Asylum
         Chamber Rules 2014 [the 2014  Procedure  Rules]  and  the  case  of
         Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418  (IAC)  that  the
         Appellant's case could still be dealt with fairly  and  justly  and
         without the Appellant  being  deprived  of  his  right  to  a  fair
         hearing, especially in light of the fact  that  the  Appellant  was
         legally represented at court by Mr Bellara Counsel) ..."

3.   In this case the position is that there was an initial letter from  the
    Appellant's solicitors to the Tribunal to say that  the  Appellant  was
    unwell.   As  it  happened  the  Appellant  was  also  seeking  medical
    attention and a medical note to  prove  that  was  also  sought.   That
    medical note did not make its way to the Tribunal or the Tribunal judge
    until after 3 pm on the same day of the hearing.  The grounds of appeal
    on behalf of the Appellant are detailed and state in part as follows:

         "3.  It is clear that the Appellant's representative  made  written
             submissions at the appeal hearing to adjourn  matters  as  the
             Appellant was not well.   At paragraph 8 the judge states that
             the Appellant did not provide any evidence that he  was  unfit
             to attend.  The representatives sent the evidence through  fax
             at 15.43 pm and 15.46 pm.  The  adjournment  request  and  the
             faxed confirmation is attached herewith.  ..."

4.   And it is said at paragraph 4

         "4.  The  judge  appears  to  have  overlooked  the  importance  of
             considering an adjournment simply because no medical  evidence
             was provided. There had been no consideration by the judge  of
             whether it was fair to hear  the  appeal  and  the  overriding
             objective  was  not  taken  into  account.   The   Appellant's
             solicitors had  written  to  the  Tribunal  stating  that  the
             Appellant was unwell.  It was unfortunate that  the  Appellant
             could not provide  medical  evidence  at  15.00  pm,  however,
             medical evidence was provide at 15.45 pm [sic].  The Appellant
             was unable to get evidence in time as the GP  was  in  meeting
             since morning [sic] and the Appellant was unable  to  see  him
             until 15.00 pm. The Appellant was not well, someone  help  him
             to reach at net cafï¿½ in order to scan the medical evidence  to
             the representatives. The circumstances or alternatively  delay
             were not in the Appellant control [sic].

         5.   The  judge  also  had  an  explanation  from  the  Appellant's
             solicitors that due to the ill health of the Appellant he  was
             able to pick up the two additional witnesses.  These witnesses
             had also produced witness statements."

5.   The judge rightly referred to the Presidential Tribunal's  decision  in
    Nwaigwe (Adjournment: fairness) [2014] UKUT 00418  (IAC).   That  is  a
    very important decision which it is right to say  changed  the  way  in
    which the Tribunal ought to  consider  adjournment  applications.   The
    judicial head note makes it clear

         "In practice, in most  cases  the  question  will  be  whether  the
         refusal deprived the affected party of his right to a fair hearing.
          Where an adjournment refusal is challenged on fairness grounds, it
         is important to recognise that the question for the Upper  Tribunal
         is not whether the FtT had acted reasonably.  Rather, the  test  to
         be applied is that of fairness:  was there any deprivation  of  the
         affected party's right to a fair hearing?"

6.   In the body of the decision at paragraph 5 it states

         "In the Rules matrix outlined above, Rule 21(2) is a  provision  of
         critical importance.  Its effect is that where a party applies  for
         an adjournment of a hearing, the  Tribunal  is  obliged,  in  every
         case, to consider whether the appeal can be "justly determined"  in
         the moving party's absence.  If  the  decision  is  to  refuse  the
         application, this must be based on the Tribunal  satisfying  itself
         that the appeal can be justly determined  in  the  absence  of  the
         party concerned.  This means that, in principle, there may be cases
         where an adjournment should be  ordered  notwithstanding  that  the
         moving party has failed to demonstrate good reason for this course.
          As a general rule, good reason will have  to  be  demonstrated  in
         order to secure an adjournment. There are strong practical and case
         management reasons  for  this,  particularly  in  the  contemporary
         litigation culture with its emphasis on efficiency and  expedition.
         However, these considerations, unquestionably important though they
         are, must be tempered and  applied  with  the  recognition  that  a
         fundamental common law right, namely the right of every litigant to
         a fair hearing, is engaged."

7.   And then at paragraph 7:

         "If a Tribunal refuses to accede to an  adjournment  request,  such
         decision could, in  principle,  be  erroneous  in  law  in  several
         respects: these include a failure to take into account all material
         considerations; permitting immaterial  considerations  to  intrude;
         denying the party concerned a fair hearing; failing  to  apply  the
         correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most  cases
         the question will be whether  the  refusal  deprived  the  affected
         party of his right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal
         is challenged on fairness grounds, it  is  important  to  recognise
         that the question for the Upper Tribunal is  not  whether  the  FtT
         acted reasonably.  Rather, the  test  to  be  applied  is  that  of
         fairness: was there any deprivation of the affected  party's  right
         to a fair  hearing?  Any  temptation  to  review  the  conduct  and
         decision of the FtT through the  lens  of  reasonableness  must  be
         firmly resisted, in order to avoid a misdirection  in  law.   In  a
         nutshell, fairness is the supreme criterion."

8.   Therefore I now consider the substantive matters before me. I  am  well
    aware and accept that there are attempts  by  some  litigants  in  this
    jurisdiction as in others to "play the system". Some litigants want  to
    delay the hearing of their case because it means they can remain in the
    United Kingdom for longer than they would normally be permitted  to  do
    so and when it is clear as a pikestaff  that  they  have  no  basis  to
    remain.

9.   This case was very different to  those  sorts  of  cases.  This  is  an
    Appellant who has always turned up at his hearing. He was  represented.
    His solicitors had alerted the Tribunal to the problem of his  illness,
    it  appears,  as  soon  as  they  became  aware  of  it  by  sending  a
    communication  urgently  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal   and   to   the
    Appellant's Counsel who had been  at  the  hearing  and  was  appearing
    before Judge Wright.

10.  This was an Appellant  who  had  cooperated  in  terms  of  bundles  of
    documents and in terms of the preparation towards his case.

11.  In this day and age of course one would hope that patients are able  to
    see their general practitioner or a medical  practitioner  swiftly  but
    that is not always possible.   I  can  well  accept  that  the  medical
    practitioner in this  instance  was  not  able  to  see  the  Appellant
    immediately, that the Appellant had to wait towards the end of the day,
    and that when the Appellant was ultimately seen, a brief short document
    was  completed  and  provided  to  the   Appellant   by   the   medical
    practitioner. In turn the Appellant then had to find an  internet  cafï¿½
    to get that document scanned and sent to the Tribunal.

12.  I take judicial knowledge of the fact that it is  not  always  easy  to
    immediately see a medical or general practitioner and to get  a  letter
    or document from that medical practitioner.  Medical practitioners  are
    busy and they have other things to  do.   Their  priority  is  not  the
    Tribunal. Their priority is their list of patients that  they  have  to
    get through.

13.  It is therefore noteworthy that this Appellant did  produce  supporting
    corroborative evidence of his  attendance  at  a  general  practitioner
    albeit it was not within the timescale sought by Judge Wright.  It  was
    just under an hour later than the time imposed by the  judge.   When  I
    come back to the question which the  Presidential  Tribunal  raises  in
    Nwaigwe at paragraph 7 and reminding myself that fairness is a  supreme
    criterion, I ask myself  was  there  fairness  in  this  case?   In  my
    judgement there was not. There was material error of law.  There should
    have been an adjournment of the case to enable the  Appellant  to  give
    evidence and for his witnesses to give evidence.  I do not indicate one
    way or the other the strength of the Appellant's case. That  is  for  a
    different occasion.  But reminding myself, as I have  to  of  what  the
    test is at this stage, I am of the clear  view  that  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Wright has to be set aside.

Notice of Decision

14.  Having given some thought to what should happen next,  in  my  judgment
    it is quite clear that  there  has  to  be  a  rehearing  and  for  the
    Appellant  and/or  his  witnesses  to  have  the  opportunity  to  give
    evidence.   The  appropriate  forum  for  that  is  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.   This case was originally heard at Hatton Cross.  It  should
    return for hearing at Hatton Cross and will be heard by a  judge  there
    other than Judge Wright.

15.  The decision of First-tier Tribunal contains a material  error  of  law
    and is set aside.

16.  The appeal shall be re-heard at the First-tier Tribunal.

No anonymity direction is made.
