For the appellant:     Ms Z Ahmed, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Sangha promulgated 19.10.15, allowing on both
    immigration and human rights grounds the claimant's appeal against  the
    decision of the Secretary  of  State,  dated  26.5.15,  to  refuse  her
    application made on 1.4.15 for leave to remain in  the  United  Kingdom
    outside the Immigration Rules on human rights grounds.  The Judge heard
    the appeal on 8.10.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Nicholson granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    6.4.16.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 26.5.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out briefly below I found such error of law in  the
    making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  to  require  the
    decision of Judge Sangha to be set aside and the decision in the appeal
    remitted to be made afresh by the First-tier  Tribunal,  in  accordance
    with the attached directions.

 5. I find that the decisions in respect of both  immigration  grounds  and
    human rights grounds were flawed.

 6. The relevant background to the appeal  can  be  summarised  briefly  as
    follows. The claimant first came to the UK in 2007 aged 13  with  entry
    clearance as a child. Her  leave  expired  in  October  2007,  but  she
    overstayed. She has been living with her mother, step-father,  and  two
    younger siblings, who are now British citizens. She is now 22 years  of
    age and has been in the  UK  for  9  years,  completing  her  secondary
    education in the UK. Several applications for EEA Residence Cards  made
    between 2007 and 2013 were refused. The application the subject of this
    appeal was made on 1.4.15, and considered on the basis of private life.



 7. It is clear that the appellant does not meet the  primary  requirements
    of paragraph 276ADE.  She  has  not  lived  in  the  UK  for  20  years
    continuously and has not lived more than half her life  here.  However,
    at �23 of the decision Judge Sangha  concluded  pursuant  to  paragraph
    276ADE(vi)  that  there  would  be  "significant   obstacles   to   the
    appellant's integration into the Ivory Coast if she were  now  required
    to leave the UK." However, the judge was in error in stating the  test.
    The  test  is  not  "significant  obstacles,"  but  "very   significant
    obstacles" to her integration in Ivory Coast.

 8. In granting permission to appeal,  Judge  Nicholson  pointed  out  that
    Judge Sangha erred in focusing on the claimant's circumstances  in  the
    UK, rather than on her prospective circumstances in Ivory Coast,  which
    should have considered primary issues relevant to return to Ivory Coast
    such as the period of time the appellant spent  in  that  country,  her
    nationality, employment prospects,  language,  and  other  difficulties
    that may be encountered there. It  is  clear  from  this  part  of  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal that the conclusion was reached  on
    the basis  of  her  family  circumstances  in  the  UK,  her  financial
    dependency on family in the UK, and her study and desire to continue to
    study in the UK. The focus being  misplaced,  Judge  Sangha  failed  to
    identify very significant obstacles that would affect  her  integration
    on return to Ivory Coast, including that she still has family there and
    her mother was able to return there in 2014.

 9. In the circumstances, the approach to paragraph 276ADE was flawed by  a
    failure to focus primarily on prospective integration in  Ivory  Coast,
    and a concentration on her integration in the UK.

10. There are a number of other errors of law in respect of the alternative
    human rights decision.

11. First, pursuant to the Nagre principle elaborated in SS (Congo)  &  Ors
    [2015] EWCA Civ  387,  the  judge  failed  to  identify  compelling  or
    exceptional circumstances insufficiently recognised in the  Immigration
    Rules so as to justify consideration of private or family life  outside
    the Rules on the basis of private or family life under article 8  ECHR,
    so that otherwise the decision would be unjustifiably harsh.

12. In SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors, the Court of Appeal re-stated  the  context
    and considered the role of public policy as expressed in the  Rules  in
    the proportionality assessment.  The  decision  maker  is  entitled  to
    decide that Article 8 considerations have been fully addressed  in  the
    Rules when dealing with 'stage two'.  If they have, it is enough to say
    so.  This will necessarily involve deciding whether there  is  a  'gap'
    between  the  Rules  and  Article  8,  and  then  whether   there   are
    circumstances in the case under consideration which take it outside the
    class of cases which the Rules properly  provide  for.   Whether  these
    circumstances are described as 'compelling' or 'exceptional' is  not  a
    matter of substance.  They must be relevant,  weighty,  and  not  fully
    provided for within the Rules.  In practice they are likely to be  both
    compelling and exceptional, but this is not a legal  requirement.   The
    first stage, therefore, is to assess how completely the  Rules  reflect
    Article 8 considerations. That exercise was  not  done  and  compelling
    circumstances  justifying  an  article   8   consideration   were   not
    identified.


13. Further and in any event, any consideration of  article  8  has  to  be
    considered through the prism of the Rules, which are the  Secretary  of
    State's proportionate response  to  private  and  family  life  claims,
    balancing those rights  against  the  public  interest  in  maintaining
    immigration control.

14. In addition, in considering article 8  outside  the  Rules,  the  judge
    failed to accord any or any sufficient weight to the public interest in
    maintaining immigration control, as required under section 117B of  the
    2002 Act. It is not sufficient for the judge to reference section 117B,
    which is done at �28 but it has to be clear that  proper  consideration
    has been made of the public interest. The  judge  also  relies  on  the
    consideration  under  paragraph  276ADE  as  outweighing   the   public
    interest, which was to confuse the balance between  rights  and  public
    interest provided within the Rules with the 'outside the Rules'  public
    interest considerations under article 8. The approach  was  flawed.  If
    the claimant met the requirements of 276ADE,  she  would  succeed.  Her
    failure to do so does not, however, strengthen the article 8 claim.

15. Further, the judge  inappropriately  gave  credit  against  the  public
    interest for the fact that the claimant speaks English and is allegedly
    financially independent, and asserts that she "has otherwise been a law
    abiding resident of the UK," when  in  fact  her  presence  was  always
    precarious and after October 2007 was entirely illegal, so that  little
    if any weight should be accorded to a private life developed in the UK.
    AM (S 117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) held that,

     (1)          The statutory duty to consider the matters set out  in  s
    117B of the 2002 Act is satisfied if the Tribunal's decision shows that
    it has had regard to such parts of it as are relevant.

     (2)          An appellant can obtain no positive right to a  grant  of
    leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever  the  degree  of
    his fluency in English, or the strength of his financial resources.

     (3)          Parliament has now drawn a sharp distinction between  any
    period of time during which a person has been in the  UK  "unlawfully",
    and any period of time during which that person's immigration status in
    the UK was merely "precarious".

     (4)          Those who at any given date held a precarious immigration
    status must have held at that date an otherwise lawful grant  of  leave
    to enter or to remain. A person's immigration status is "precarious" if
    their continued presence  in  the  UK  will  be  dependent  upon  their
    obtaining a further grant of leave.

16. Having allowed the appeal on immigration grounds it was  not  necessary
    to also allow it on human rights  grounds,  though  there  was  nothing
    wrong  in  principle  in  considering  human  rights  grounds  in   the
    alternative, which the  judge  did  from  �24  onwards.  However,  both
    decisions were flawed, in error of law, and cannot stand.

17. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal vitiates all  other  findings  of
    fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been  a
    valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

18. In all the circumstances, I consider  it  appropriate  to  relist  this
    appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I do so  on  the
    basis that this is a  case  which  falls  squarely  within  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement at paragraph  7.2.  The  effect  of  the
    error has been to deprive the appellant of a fair hearing and that  the
    nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which  is  necessary  for
    the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such that, having regard to
    the overriding objective in rule  2  to  deal  with  cases  fairly  and
    justly, including with the avoidance  of  delay,  I  find  that  it  is
    appropriate  to  remit  this  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal to be made de novo.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.




Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal of the Secretary of State has been allowed.
