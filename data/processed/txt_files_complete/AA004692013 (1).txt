For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, a Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant who was born on 17 October 1978 is a citizen of Nigeria.
      She appeals to the Upper Tribunal against a decision of the First-tier
      Tribunal dated 29 April 2013.
   2. The  appellant's  documents  which  were  put  before  the  First-tier
      Tribunal included  a  report  of  an  expert  witness,  Bisi  Olateru-
      Olagbegi. That witness's report considered inter alia,  matters  which
      touched upon the credibility of the appellant's  account.  Whilst  she
      concluded that the core of the appellant's account  was  not  credible
      [57] the First-tier Tribunal judge made no reference whatever  to  the
      report of the expert witness. We consider her failure to do so  to  be
      an error of law such that her determination falls  to  be  set  aside.
      Given that the credibility findings of the First-tier Tribunal  cannot
      be considered reliable, we consider that it  is  appropriate  for  the
      appeal to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal (not Judge Henderson)
      to remake the decision following a substantive fact-finding hearing.


DECISION

1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal dated 29 April 2013  is  set
aside. The appeal is remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  remake  the
decision. None of the findings of fact  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  shall
stand.



Signed                              Date 15 July 2013
