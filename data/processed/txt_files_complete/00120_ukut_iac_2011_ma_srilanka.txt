Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr H Kanangara
For the Respondent:    Mr J Gulvin, Home Office Presenting Officer

The requirement by the respondent that an applicant for leave to  remain  as
a Tier 1 (General) Migrant, whose last leave  was  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
Student), must have physically  undertaken work in an overseas  country  for
an uplift to apply to his earnings in that country, is imposed  by  Guidance
only and is not contained in the Rules. Thus, in line with  SSHD  v  Pankina
[2010] EWCA Civ  719,  this  Guidance  is  ineffective  to  impose  such  an
additional requirement.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka and was born  on  12  November
    1984.

2.    On 20 April 2010 he was granted leave to remain in the United  Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student until 12 July 2010.  On 12 July  2010  he
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General)
    Migrant.  That application was refused  by  the  respondent  by  letter
    dated 27 August 2010.

The Law and Guidance

3.    The application was governed by paragraph 245C of HC  395  Immigration
    Rules as amended.  Paragraph 245C provides that to qualify for leave to
    remain as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant,  an  applicant  must  meet  the
    requirements listed there.  If those requirements are  satisfied  leave
    to remain will be granted.  The requirements there set out include that
    the applicant must have the specified minimum number  of  points  under
    paragraphs 1 to 31 of Appendix A.

      The provisions of Appendix A  in  relation  to  earnings  include  the
    following.

            "13. Earnings include, but are not limited to:


           (a) salaries (includes full-time, part-time and bonuses),


           (b) earnings derived through self-employment,


           (c) earnings derived through business activities,


           (d) statutory  and  contractual  maternity  pay,  statutory  and
           contractual adoption pay,


           (e)  allowances  (such  as  accommodation,  schooling   or   car
           allowances) which  form  part  of  an  applicant's  remuneration
           package,


           (f) dividends from investments, where it is a company  in  which
           the applicant is active in the day-to-day management,  or  where
           the  applicant  receives  the  dividend   as   part   of   their
           remuneration package,


           (g) property rental income, where this constitutes part  of  the
           applicant's business, and
           (h) payments in lieu of notice.


           14. Where the earnings take the form of a salary or wages,  they
           will be assessed before tax (i.e. gross salary).


           15. Where the earnings are the profits  of  a  business  derived
           through  self-employment  or  other  business  activities,   the
           earnings that will be assessed are the profits of  the  business
           before tax.  Where  the  applicant  only  has  a  share  of  the
           business, the earnings that will be assessed are the profits  of
           the business before tax to  which  to  which  the  applicant  is
           entitled.


           ....................


           18. Earnings in a foreign currency will be  converted  to  pound
           sterling (�) using the closing spot exchange rate for  the  last
           day of the period for which the applicant has  claimed  earnings
           in that currency.


           ....................


           21.  Once  converted,  earnings  will  be  multiplied   by   the
           multiplier shown in table 2A  below.  The  relevant  country  or
           territory is whichever country or  territory  the  currency  was
           earned in.


           22. A multiplier will not be applied to  oversees  earnings  (if
           any) of an applicant who has, or was last granted,  leave  as  a
           Highly  Skilled  Migrant,  Tier  1  (General)  Migrant,  Writer,
           Composer or Artist, or Self-employed Lawyer and who is  applying
           for leave to remain.


           23.  Where  the  previous  earnings  claimed  are  in  different
           currencies,  any  foreign  currencies  will  be  converted   and
           multiplied before being added together, and then added to any UK
           earnings, to give a total amount."

      Table 2A provides for the application of a  multiplier  of  5.3  where
    the money was earned in Sri Lanka.

4.    The UK Border Agency published  policy  guidance  in  respect  of  the
    points-based system under Tier 1 (General).  The  edition  relevant  to
    the application with which we are concerned was published  on  6  April
    2010.  That included the following statements in relation to  adjusting
    overseas earnings.

         "131. To reflect differences in income levels across the world, the
             income level required to  score  points  varies  depending  on
             where the applicant was working at the time he/she earned  the
             money.  We use a  series  of  calculations  (known  as  uplift
             ratios) to bring overseas salaries in line with United Kingdom
             equivalents.  The level of  uplift  we  give  depends  on  the
             average income in the country in which the earnings were  made
             ... Table 2A of Appendix A  (Attributes)  of  the  Immigration
             Rules lists countries and the appropriate conversion rate.


         132.      The  country  in  which  the  applicant  has   physically
             undertaken the work,  rather  than  his/her  nationality,  the
             currency payment is made in or the country in which payment is
             made, determines the income band against which we will  assess
             the earnings.


         133.     Where  an  applicant  has  earnings  from  more  than  one
             country,  the  points  based  calculator  will  apply  in  the
             appropriate  uplift  ratio  for  each  country  in  which  the
             relevant earnings were made in order to  provide  a  total  UK
             equivalent value of earnings."

5.    By  a  letter  dated  27  August  2010  the  respondent  rejected  the
    appellant's application.  The letter stated in relevant part:

         "You have claimed 20 points for previous earnings under Appendix  A
         of the Immigration Rules, but on the basis  of  the  documents  you
         have provided you do not qualify for the award of  points  in  this
         area.


         The reasons for this decision are detailed below.


         You have claimed points  for  earnings  of  �38,605.20  from  self-
         employment and have  supplied  financial  statements,  accountant's
         letter, employer (client) letter and tax documents as  evidence  of
         these earnings.


         ...


         Also, the income band against which previous earnings are  accessed
         at initial application stage is dependent upon the country in which
         an applicant has been physically working, rather than  the  country
         in which the earnings were paid.


         As the earnings you are claiming points for were  generated  whilst
         you were working in the UK, no uplift has been applied to them.


         We have therefore been unable to award the  points,  in  line  with
         published guidance ..."

      In addition the respondent decided  that  certain  documents  did  not
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

6.    The appellant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  and
    Asylum Chamber). The appeal was heard at the IAC, Sheldon,  Birmingham,
    on 4 October 2010 before Immigration Judge Meah.

7.    In a determination promulgated on 5  October  2010  Immigration  Judge
    Meah concluded that the additional documents which  had  been  received
    were sufficient to  satisfy  the  documentary  requirements  under  the
    Rules.  However, he concluded that the appellant was still not eligible
    to receive the 20 points claimed under the previous  earnings  heading.
    The judge considered that  he  did  not  qualify  for  the  uplift  for
    overseas earnings because the work had actually been carried out in the
    United Kingdom.

8.    We note that the argument on this point before the  Immigration  Judge
    proceeded on the basis of the  policy  guidance  document.   The  judge
    concluded (at page 14):

         "... I find that given the appellant's  employment  was  based  and
         undertaken in the UK, this must count as UK earnings as opposed  to
         earnings from overseas, notwithstanding the fact that he  may  have
         been paid and taxed overseas.  In other words, I find the  physical
         location of where the employment  is  undertaken  is  an  important
         factor in deciding whether an applicant is eligible for  an  uplift
         based on claimed overseas earnings."

9.    The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal.
     On 27 October 2010 Senior Immigration Judge Martin granted  permission
    to appeal on the ground that it was arguable that the Immigration Judge
    erred in failing to  apply  the  uplift  to  the  sums  earned  by  the
    appellant in Sri Lanka and upon which he paid taxes in Sri Lanka.

10.   The appeal came before us on 1 February 2011.   For  reasons  set  out
    later in this judgment we considered that  the  Immigration  Judge  had
    made a material error of law in his decision on the application of  the
    uplift.  Accordingly we set  aside  those  parts  of  the  decision  of
    Immigration Judge Meah relating to the uplift  (paragraphs  10  to  17)
    save  that  we  maintained  his   conclusion   that   the   documentary
    requirements of the Immigration Rules had been complied with.  We  then
    proceeded at the same hearing to remake the decision.

11.   There was no issue as to the facts of the matter. The  earnings  which
    the appellant claimed should be brought into account under  Appendix  A
    included income for consultancy services  he  had  provided  to  a  Sri
    Lankan company based in Sri Lanka.  The appellant was  present  in  the
    United Kingdom when he actually undertook the work. The  services  were
    provided from the United Kingdom by using e-mails and fax. He was  paid
    in Sri Lankan rupees.  In this way  the  appellant  earned  Sri  Lankan
    rupees 1,200,000.00 gross (Sri Lankan rupees  1,189,500.00  net).   The
    sums were paid to his bank account in Sri Lanka in Sri Lankan currency.
    He paid the appropriate income tax on these sums in Sri Lanka.

12.   The only issue before us was whether this income fell  to  be  treated
    as overseas earnings to which the uplift applied within Appendix A.  It
    was common ground between the parties that if the  uplift  applied  the
    appeal must succeed and the application must be granted.  On behalf  of
    the appellant Mr Kanangara relies on  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
    Appeal in Secretary of State for the Home Department v  Pankina  [2010]
    EWCA Civ 719.  There the Court of Appeal  held  that  only  that  which
    enjoys or secures Parliament's authority - in the present case  by  the
    absence of a negative resolution within 40 days after being laid before
    Parliament - is entitled  to  the  quasi-legal  status  of  Immigration
    Rules.  In that case the particular requirement which had been  imposed
    by the Secretary of State did not form part of the Rules  as  so  laid.
    The Court of Appeal held that the  guidance  did  not  have  the  legal
    effect of imposing  such  a  requirement.   Sedley  LJ  explained  that
    statutory recognition of Rules which would have the character  and,  on
    appeal, the force of law,  requires  such  Rules  to  be  certain.   He
    considered that that shut out criteria  affecting  individuals'  status
    and  entitlements  which  have  not  themselves   been   tendered   for
    Parliamentary scrutiny and even if ascertainable at that point of  time
    may  be  changed  without  fresh  scrutiny.  Therefore  the  additional
    criterion imposed by the Guidance formed no part of the Rules.

13.   It follows from Pankina that the issue in the  present  case  must  be
    determined by reference to the  rules  and  not  by  reference  to  any
    requirements or criteria indicated by guidance which are not  contained
    in the Rules.

14.   We consider that the uplift provision contained  in  paragraph  21  of
    Appendix A applies. These were earnings derived  from  self-employment.
    They were earned in Sri Lanka within the meaning  of  paragraph  21  of
    Schedule  A  notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  appellant  was  not
    physically present there at that time.  The earnings were  payment  for
    services provided in Sri Lanka to a Sri Lankan  company  based  in  Sri
    Lanka.  They were paid for there in Sri Lankan rupees, in sums credited
    to the appellant's account there and they were subject  to  income  tax
    there.  There is no specific requirement under the  Immigration  Rules,
    whether expressly or by necessary implication, that the person  earning
    the payment must be physically present there at the relevant time.   In
    the particular circumstances of  this  case  the  payment  is  properly
    regarded as arising in Sri Lanka.

  15. We accept that the Guidelines seek to impose a  requirement  that  the
      person earning must be physically present in the country concerned  at
      the  relevant  time.   However,  that  seeks  to  impose   a   further
      requirement which is not imposed by the Immigration Rules  themselves.
      Pankina makes clear that this is not permissible.  The Guidance cannot
      be used in this way to alter the  substantive  effect  of  Immigration
      Rules approved by Parliament.


  16. Mr Gulvin did not contend that at the date  of  the  adoption  of  the
      relevant provisions  in  Appendix  A  there  was  pre-existing  policy
      guidance to the effect that the applicant must  have  been  physically
      present in the country concerned at the time the sums were earned.  He
      did not seek to advance any argument on that basis.

  17. We note that the other categories of qualifying earnings in  paragraph
      13 of Appendix A include earnings derived through business activities,
      allowances which form part of  an  applicant's  remuneration  package,
      dividends from investments where the applicant receives  the  dividend
      as part of a remuneration package and  property  rental  income  where
      this constitutes part of the applicant's business. As with  qualifying
      earnings derived through self-employment,  there  is  nothing  in  the
      Immigration Rules to suggest that there  is  a  requirement  that  the
      applicant be physically present in the country where the income arises
      at the relevant time.  Indeed, these categories may  well  contemplate
      situations in which  a  person  is  not  physically  present  in  that
      jurisdiction.

  18. More fundamentally, we consider that the clear purpose of  the  uplift
      provision in Appendix A is to attempt to  equalise  levels  of  income
      from different countries in order to secure the  fair  application  of
      the Immigration Rules. Overseas earnings are,  in  this  way,  brought
      into  line  with  their  United  Kingdom  equivalents.  Countries  and
      territories are allocated to different  groups  within  Table  2A  and
      different multipliers apply  accordingly.   The  multipliers  are,  no
      doubt, intended to reflect local conditions and  levels  of  earnings.
      The intention of the uplift is to  secure,  so  far  as  this  may  be
      possible, that income arising in different jurisdictions is considered
      on an equal basis. The criteria laid down  in  the  Immigration  Rules
      achieve that result.  For all the reasons we  have  given  above,  the
      income with which we are concerned in the particular circumstances  of
      the present case clearly falls to be regarded as earned in Sri  Lanka,
      notwithstanding the fact that the appellant was  not  present  in  Sri
      Lanka at the relevant time. It clearly falls within the policy of  the
      rule. It is necessary  to  apply  the  uplift  in  order  that  it  be
      considered fairly in the application of the Immigration Rules.


  19. Mr  Gulvin  submitted  that  although  the  Appellant  is  not  within
      paragraph 22 of Appendix A, because his last leave was  as  a  Tier  4
      (General) Student, the Guidance extends the exclusion  of  the  uplift
      provided for in paragraph 22 with modifications to  Tier  4  (General)
      Students.  However, whatever may have been the  intention  in  issuing
      the Guidance, this argument cannot succeed because, as  Pankina  makes
      clear, Guidance cannot be used to impose on  an  applicant  additional
      requirements  which  are  not  contained  in  the  Immigration   Rules
      themselves.

  20. Mr Gulvin accepted that if the physical location of the  appellant  is
      not a  requirement  for  the  application  of  the  uplift  under  the
      Immigration Rules, the appellant would qualify for  leave  to  remain.
      He did not seek to persuade us that the application would fail on  any
      other grounds.

  21. For these reasons we allow the appeal.

The          Hon.          Mr          Justice          Lloyd          Jones
