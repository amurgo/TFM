Representation:

For the Appellants:          Ms H Masood (counsel instructed by Law Dale
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:       Mr S Melvin (Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. These are the appeals of Zahid  Hasan  Roni  and  [NB],  citizens  of
       Bangladesh born 4 August 1999  and  22  November  2005,  against  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge  Brewer)  of  26  November
       2018  to  dismiss  their  appeals,  themselves  brought  against  the
       Respondent's decision of 13 October 2017 to refuse their applications
       to join their mother in the  UK  on  the  basis  that  she  had  sole
       responsibility for their upbringing.


    2. The applications, made on 7 July 2017,  were  to  join  their  mother
       [GB], born 7 July 1971.

    3. The First-tier Tribunal noted that the Sponsor  had  difficulties  in
       giving oral evidence, and struggled to remember her  childrens'  ages
       or her own date of birth; she failed at  times  to  answer  even  the
       simplest questions and could not recall  when  she  obtained  British
       citizenship. The Tribunal accepted that her evidence was nevertheless
       credible, and that any discrepancies or vagueness was simply down  to
       her being clearly upset and confused.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal set out the evidence that  it  accepted.  The
       Sponsor married her husband in Bangladesh in 1987, and they had  five
       children, four daughters and one son. Three daughters  (aged  27,  28
       and 29) were married, two living with their families  in  Bangladesh,
       one with her family in the UK.

    5. The Appellants were (as at November 2018) aged 18 and  13.  They  had
       originally been raised by their parents together in  Bangladesh,  and
       since 2007 had  lived  with  their  father.  When  the  Sponsor  left
       Bangladesh they were aged 8 and 2. She spoke to them  regularly  over
       the telephone. They had extended family in Bangladesh by way of their
       mother's brother  and  sister,  and  their  father's  relatives.  The
       Sponsor earned �23,000 in steady employment as a culinary  recruiter.
       She regularly sent them money, via their father until  Zahid  reached
       the age of 17, at which point he was named  as  the  recipient;  this
       money was used for the whole family in Bangladesh, including food and
       school fees, and medical bills for the Sponsor's husband.

    6. The Judge noted that the medical  evidence  relating  to  the  father
       related only to a back problem;  there  was  no  evidence  of  mental
       capacity issues or that he could not walk, though he was recorded  as
       having had problems walking in 2017.

    7. In oral evidence the Sponsor stated that her husband "cannot walk  or
       feed the children" though then back-tracked to say that he could cook
       by sitting on a chair, and spent most of the time lying down, using a
       stick to  move  around;  the  children  went  hungry  as  he  had  no
       assistance in raising them. He could not make decisions  about  their
       welfare. When her husband went to the doctor he was taken by Zahid.

    8. The Sponsor had variously stated that  she  took  all  the  decisions
       about  her  childrens'  education  including  in  relation  to  their
       education "by working"; she  sometimes  spoke  to  the  school  about
       school fees. She also said that her sister,  their  aunt,  told  them
       when to see a doctor.

    9. The Judge reviewed the authorities on sole responsibility,  including
       Mundeba and TD Yemen, noting that this was a case where the  children
       continued to live with their father,  the  question  therefore  being
       whether he had abdicated responsibility for them.

   10. The Tribunal accepted  that  the  Sponsor  provided  for  the  family
       generally in Bangladesh, including for her childrens' upkeep. It  did
       not accept that she precisely specified on what the money  should  be
       spent; it was not plausible that she would  detail  the  food  to  be
       bought. It was  not  established  that  the  Sponsor  had  continuing
       control and  direction  over  their  upbringing  including  important
       decision making; her husband had stated that he  discussed  decisions
       about the Appellant's education, and her  sister  made  decisions  on
       medical issues. The documents from the schools  were  silent  on  any
       involvement by the Sponsor in her childrens' schooling.

   11. At �38 the Tribunal stated "The evidence is that the father has never
       not been involved  in  the  appellants'  upbringing,  and  that  this
       involvement does equate to shared responsibility; it  is  not  simply
       the inevitable consequence of the sponsor being in the UK."

   12. Reviewing the case outside the Rules via Article 8 ECHR,  and  having
       regard to the best interests of the child, it would be disruptive  to
       remove Nila from school at a critical moment in  her  education,  and
       there was no evidence that Zahid wished to study in the UK. There was
       no evidence that their best interests would be served other  than  by
       the present arrangements continuing, and  the  Sponsor  was  free  to
       visit them; indeed they could visit her  in  the  UK.  There  was  no
       evidence that they had any problems with their education or that they
       had not had a normal upbringing. Overall the immigration decision was
       not disproportionate with the private and family life with  which  it
       interfered.

   13. Grounds of appeal contended the First-tier  Tribunal  had  materially
       erred in law because


      a) The appropriate test was not simply whether the Sponsor had
         continuing control and direction over the childrens' upbringing:
         the test was modified in a "two-parent" case and thus the Judge
         had been wrong to unduly concentrate on the mother's role in
         decision making;


      b) It attached undue weight to the evidence that the Sponsor's sister
         was involved in medical decision making;


      c) There was no clear evidential basis for the conclusion �38 that
         the father "had never not been involved" in their upbringing.

   14. Permission to appeal was granted by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  4
       January 2019 on the basis that the grounds were arguable.


   15. Ms Masood argued that the critical question in  a  "two-parent"  case
       was not whether the Sponsor exercised control and direction from  the
       United  Kingdom  but  whether  the  parent  abroad  had   effectively
       abrogated responsibility for their child's care. This wrongful  focus
       inevitably led to the Tribunal becoming distracted in its  subsequent
       evaluation of the evidence.

   16. Mr Melvin relied on the Rule 24 response which had  highlighted  that
       the Judge had referred to the lack of evidence that the  mother  took
       the important or key decisions in the Appellants' lives, and that the
       school documents did not mention any involvement by the Sponsor.

  Decision and reasons

   17. The admission of the Appellants is governed by immigration rule  297,
       which so far as relevant to the issues in dispute provides:


         "297. The requirements to be met by a person seeking indefinite
         leave to enter the United Kingdom as the child of a parent, parents
         or a relative present and settled or being admitted for settlement
         in the United Kingdom are that he:
         (i) is seeking leave to enter to accompany or join a parent,
         parents or a relative in one of the following circumstances:
         ...
           (e) one parent is present and settled in the United Kingdom or
           being admitted on the same occasion for settlement and has had
           sole responsibility for the child's upbringing; or
           (f) one parent or a relative is present and settled in the
           United Kingdom or being admitted on the same occasion for
           settlement and there are serious and compelling family or other
           considerations which make exclusion of the child undesirable and
           suitable arrangements have been made for the child's care;"


Children and Sole Responsibility


   18. As is explained in judgments such as  that  of  Buxton  LJ  in  Cenir
       [2003] EWCA Civ 572: "The general guidance is to look at whether what
       has been done in relation to the upbringing has been done  under  the
       direction of the sponsoring settled parent ... the importance of  the
       parent with responsibility, albeit at a distance, having what can  be
       identified as direction over or control of important decisions in the
       child's life."


   19. TD Yemen [2006] UKAIT 00049 made a very thorough survey of the  legal
       principles relevant to the assessment of sole responsibility:

           "13. A central part of the notion of "sole responsibility" for a
           child's upbringing is the UK-based parent's continuing  interest
           and involvement in the child's life, including making  or  being
           consulted about and  approving  important  decisions  about  the
           child's upbringing. ...
           30. The Court of Appeal [in Nmaju  [2001]  INLR  26]  saw  "sole
           responsibility" as a practical (rather than  exclusively  legal)
           exercise of "control" by the UK-based parent  over  the  child's
           upbringing and whether what is done by the carer is done  "under
           the direction" of that parent.
           ...
           27. What is apparent from both the  judgments  is  the  need  to
           establish "responsibility" for the  child's  upbringing  in  the
           sense of decision-making, control  and  obligation  towards  the
           child which must lie  exclusively  with  the  parent.  Financial
           support, even exclusive financial support, will not  necessarily
           mean that the person providing it has "sole responsibility"  for
           the child. It is a factor but no more than that.
           ...
           34. These cases are largely concerned with the  issue  of  "sole
           responsibility" arising between a UK-parent  and  relatives  who
           are looking after the child in the country of origin. In many of
           the cases, the other parent has  disappeared  from  the  child's
           life totally or plays so little part  as  to  have,  in  effect,
           abdicated any responsibility for its upbringing. What emerges is
           a concept of "authority" or "control" over a child's  upbringing
           which derives from the natural  social  and  legal  role  of  an
           individual  as  a  parent.  Whilst  others  may,  by  force   of
           circumstances, look after a child, it may be that they are doing
           so only on behalf of the child's parent.  The  struggle  in  the
           case law is to identify when  the  parent's  responsibility  has
           been relinquished in part or  whole  to  another  such  that  it
           should  be  said  that  there  is  shared   rather   than   sole
           responsibility. By contrast, where both parents  are  active  in
           the child's life, the involvement of the parent in  the  country
           of origin is  significant  -  perhaps  crucial  -  in  assessing
           whether the parent in the UK has "sole responsibility"  for  the
           child.
           ...
           44. In most of the cases, the parent based in  the  child's  own
           country - usually the father - has abdicated any  responsibility
           for his child by disappearing or taking no part in  the  child's
           upbringing. There is only one parent  involved  in  the  child's
           life. If one started from principle, it might  be  thought  that
           the issue of "responsibility" for a child  and  whether  or  not
           that amounts to "sole responsibility" is  exclusively  an  issue
           between parents. The issue of sole  responsibility  should  not,
           therefore, arise. However, that is not the position taken in the
           cases, including those in the Court of Appeal.  We  accept  that
           the question of "sole responsibility" is not so  restricted  and
           it remains an issue even where there is only one parent but, for
           practical reasons, the child is looked  after  by  others  (see,
           Ramos, above, per Dillon  LJ  at  p  151).  The  issue  is  then
           whether, as between the relative/carers and the UK-based parent,
           the latter has "sole responsibility" for the child.
           45. To understand the proper approach  to  the  issue  of  "sole
           responsibility", we begin with the situation where a  child  has
           both parents involved in its life. The starting  point  must  be
           that  both  parents  share  responsibility  for  their   child's
           upbringing. This would be the position if the parents and  child
           lived in the same country and we can see no reason in  principle
           why it should be different if one parent has moved to the United
           Kingdom. 46. In order to conclude that the UK-based  parent  had
           "sole responsibility" for the child, it would  be  necessary  to
           show that the parent abroad had abdicated any responsibility for
           the child and was merely acting at the direction of the UK-based
           parent and was  otherwise  totally  uninvolved  in  the  child's
           upbringing. The possibility clearly cannot be ruled out:  Alagon
           provides an example of this exceptional situation and turns upon
           an acceptance by the judge of the wholly unusual situation  that
           the father was "doing nothing for the child beyond the bare fact
           of living with her on reasonably good terms". (at p 345).
           ...
           52. Questions of "sole  responsibility"  under  the  immigration
           rules should be approached as follows:
           ...
                 iv. Wherever the parents are, if both parents are  involved
                 in the upbringing of the child, it will be exceptional that
                 one of them will have sole responsibility."


   20. Notwithstanding the elegant concision with which Ms Masood  made  her
       central submission, I do not consider that the grounds of appeal  are
       here made out.


   21. Ms Masood was quite correct to identify that the case law shows  that
       where two parents have been involved in a child's upbringing,  it  is
       necessary  to  evaluate  whether  the  one  abroad  has  relinquished
       responsibility. However, as the authorities also show,  the  critical
       question will remain whether the  UK-resident  parent  can  establish
       responsibility for the child's upbringing via their "decision-making,
       control and obligation towards the child" (TD Yemen).  Doubtless  the
       fact  of  abdication  of  responsibility  would  make  it  easier  to
       establish sole responsibility by the UK-based parent. However, either
       parent  may  be  found  to   have   relinquished   some   degree   of
       responsibility to another person such that  there  is  shared  rather
       than sole responsibility; here  of  course  there  is  the  Sponsor's
       sister's role to consider, too.

   22. Where a child has two parents involved  in  its  life,  the  starting
       point must be  that  they  share  responsibility  for  their  child's
       upbringing, and only exceptional factors will rebut this presumption.
       The father has consistently been involved in his daughter's life.  It
       was in this context that the Appellant's task on appeal  arose:  that
       being  "to  show  that  the   parent   abroad   had   abdicated   any
       responsibility for the child and was merely acting at  the  direction
       of the UK-based parent and was otherwise totally  uninvolved  in  the
       child's upbringing" (TD (Yemen) �45).

   23. The First-tier Tribunal was plainly alive to the critical question on
       the  appeal,  which  was  that   whether   the   Sponsor   had   sole
       responsibility  was  a  question  of  fact  to   which   geographical
       separation was of only limited relevance. It is  understandable  that
       the Judge concluded that the evidence before it was  not  capable  of
       demonstrating sole responsibility.

   24. For example, a letter from the Appellants' father Bashir  Ali  stated
       "My wife is in the UK. Due to financial difficulties she had to go to
       the UK to earn money. I was not in any position  to  provide  support
       our family in Bangladesh. My  wife  is  the  decision  maker  in  the
       family. I always consult with her for the upbringing,  education  and
       medical needs of the children. It is very difficult for  me  to  look
       after them. I am very ill. I had an operation and  it  getting  worse
       day to day." There are rather vague assertions in the  Sponsor's  own
       witness statement as to having had responsibility for  schooling  and
       health.

   25. It is very difficult to see how material of  this  unspecific  nature
       could demonstrate that the father had  abrogated  responsibility  for
       his children. On the  chronology  here,  he  had  apparently  jointly
       raised the Appellants with their mother from their births in 1999 and
       2005 until her departure in 2007. Given that the medical evidence  is
       put forward to demonstrate a history by which the father  has  become
       increasingly less able to cope physically, the question arises as  to
       the timing of the asserted abrogation of responsibility, and thus the
       moment at which the parents stopped sharing  overall  responsibility.
       And this arises in the context of the Sponsor's sister  (their  aunt)
       having been present to help  with  issues  such  as  healthcare.  The
       proposition apparently underlying this case is that  at  some  point,
       the father has relinquished all responsibility for assisting  in  the
       direction of the childrens' well-being; but this does not necessarily
       flow from the mere fact that he has become less  physically  able  to
       care for them. Their aunt has apparently consistently been  available
       to help with the physical side of things.

   26. The First-tier Tribunal noted evidence that the Sponsor's husband had
       stated that he discussed decisions regarding  the  child's  education
       with her: it was entitled to find that  this  represented  a  shared,
       rather than a sole responsibility. Indeed, the husband's statement in
       his letter that he consulted with  his  wife  provides  a  reasonable
       evidence base for this conclusion. Equally, the  First-tier  Tribunal
       was entitled to find that responsibility for the Appellants' care was
       shared between the Sponsor and her sister given that the  latter  had
       control over medical decision making.


   27. As to the other grounds, the weight to be given to the evidence as to
       the sister's involvement was a matter for  the  Judge  assessing  the
       evidence as a whole. I do not consider that any aspect  of  the  case
       was left out of consideration when this finding was  made.  Doubtless
       the phrase impugned in the grounds of appeal, ie the finding that the
       father "had never not been involved" in  their  upbringing,  was  one
       whose syntax invited a challenge as to  its  cogency.  But  when  one
       steps back and reviews the evidence as a whole, it seems to  me  that
       the Judge was  there  pointing  to  the  very  consideration  I  have
       outlined above  at  greater  length.  By  drawing  attention  to  the
       father's ostensible ongoing involvement in the childrens' lives,  the
       First-tier Tribunal was highlighting the fact that the  case  on  the
       timing of any shift in responsibility between the parents was  simply
       too vague for the appeal to succeed.

   28. I accordingly conclude that there was no material error of law in the
       decision appealed, which stands.

          Decision:

    There is no material error of law in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.
    The appeal is dismissed.
