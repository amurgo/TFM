                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Harding, Counsel.
For the Respondent:    Ms. A. Holmes, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. An anonymity order has been made in these proceedings and I direct that
    it continues.

 2. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  Tanzania  who  appealed  against  the
    respondent's refusal to grant  international  protection  and  also  on
    human rights grounds.  His appeal was heard by Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Wylie who in a decision promulgated on 16 April 2015 dismissed
    the appellant's appeal.

 3. The appellant sought permission to appeal which was granted by Judge of
    the First-tier Tribunal Osborne on 15 May  2015.   Although  permission
    was granted on all grounds the emphasis was  on  the  Article  8  issue
    which Judge Osborne dealt with at paragraph 3 of his  reasons  for  his
    decision.  It states:-

         "In an otherwise careful and focused decision  and  reasons  it  is
         nonetheless arguable that the judge  erred  in  her  assessment  of
         Article 8.  It is arguable that it is irrational for the  judge  to
         have found that after nearly twenty years of living in the UK  that
         the appellant had not established  either  a  family  nor  (sic)  a
         private life."

 4. Thus the appeal came before me today.

 5. Mr. Harding relied upon his grounds of appeal but told  me  that  there
    had been discussions between the two representatives and if appropriate
    the hearing before me could be dealt with simply  by  reliance  on  the
    inadequate analysis of the appellant's private and family life and  the
    irrationality disclosed within the judge's conclusions.  In  any  event
    the appellant has now been resident in the United Kingdom for in excess
    of twenty years.

 6. Ms. Holmes agreed with the position as outlined by Mr. Harding  and  by
    consent of both parties I was  invited  to  allow  the  appeal  to  the
    limited extent that it be remitted back to the Secretary of State for a
    lawful decision to be made.

 7. I, on my own analysis of the appeal, share the analysis put forward  by
    the two representatives.

Decision

 8. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I remake the decision in the appeal  by  allowing  it  to  the  limited
    extent that it is remitted back to the Secretary of State for a  lawful
    decision to be made.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

Signed                              Date 21 September 2015.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Appleyard
