Representation:
For the Appellant:      Mr S. Vokes, instructed by Coventry Law Centre
For the Respondent:     Mr. T. Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant is a national  of  Afghanistan  and  a  Pashtun.  He  had
    initially stated that he was born on 1 September 1994 but his  date  of
    birth was subsequently assessed by  his  local  authority  as  being  1
    September 1994. This assessment was not challenged within this appeal.

2.   He arrived in the United Kingdom on 23 November 2011  and  applied  for
    asylum. The basis of his claim was that he and his family were at  risk
    in  Afghanistan  from  people  to  whom  his  father  owed  money.  His
    application was refused on 22 February 2011 but he was granted  limited
    leave to remain as an unaccompanied child who had claimed asylum  until
    1 March 2012. He did not appeal against  the  decision  to  refuse  him
    asylum.

3.   The Appellant applied for further leave to remain on 15  February  2012
    but his application was refused on 10 May 2012. He did  appeal  against
    this decision and his appeal was allowed by Immigration Judge  Grimmett
    on 5 July 2012  on  the  basis  that  the  decision  had  not  been  in
    accordance with the law as the Respondent had failed to take any  steps
    to trace the Appellant's parents.

4.   The Respondent undertook a review of the  Appellant's  case  but  on  3
    December 2014 maintained her decision to refuse the  Appellant  further
    leave to remain. He appealed against this decision and his  appeal  was
    dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Mather in a decision promulgated
    on 17 July 2015.  He sought permission to appeal against this  decision
    on 14 July 2015. First-tier Tribunal Judge Pedro refused to  grant  him
    permission to appeal  on  31  July  2015.  However,  I  did  grant  him
    permission to appeal on 4 September 2015.

5.   When doing so I noted that the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed  to
    refer to the contents of the letters  from  Professor  Clayton  or  The
    Children's Society or give detailed consideration to what was  said  by
    the Appellant and Linda Morgan about the circumstances which would face
    the Appellant if he were to be returned to Kabul. In addition, I  noted
    that she had failed to take into account the fact  that  the  Appellant
    would be returning as a young adult who no  longer  subscribed  to  the
    cultural norms  of  Afghanistan.   In  a  decision,  promulgated  on  8
    December 2015 The President, The Honourable Mr. Justice  McCloskey  and
    myself found that there were errors of law made in the decision made by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Mather and set aside her decision and set the
    appeal down for a re-hearing in the Upper Tribunal.

THE HEARINGS

6.   I started to hear the appeal in the Upper Tribunal on 25 November  2015
    and heard oral evidence that day from Linda Morgan, who  had  been  the
    Appellant's foster carer.  I also started to hear  oral  evidence  from
    Professor Susan Clayton. However, issues arose in relation to  some  of
    the evidence being referred  to  by  Professor  Clayton.  Therefore,  I
    adjourned the hearing part-heard and gave directions to both parties to
    provide me with further evidence. There was  a  delay  in  the  parties
    complying with these directions and the hearing was not able to be  re-
    listed until 4 July 2016. On that day Professor  Clayton  gave  further
    evidence and I heard submissions by counsel for the Appellant  and  the
    Home  Office  Presenting  Officer.  Professor  Clayton  also  forwarded
    material she had referred to at the hearing shortly afterwards. I  will
    refer to the evidence being relied  upon,  these  submissions  and  the
    content of the skeleton argument and further written  submissions  made
    by counsel when  considering  my  findings  below.  (I  have  read  and
    considered all the evidence and the fact that I do not refer to  it  in
    detail should not be taken to indicate that I have not  taken  it  into
    account.)

7.   At the beginning of  the  second  hearing  counsel  for  the  Appellant
    confirmed that the Appellant did not seek to rely on any rights he  may
    have under the European Convention on Human Rights and  submitted  that
    the  Appellant  was  entitled  to  leave  to  remain  under   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules.

MY FINDINGS

8.   I have considered the report by Mir Abas, which is in  the  Appellant's
    Bundle, and I accept that the Appellant is a national  of  Afghanistan.
    Mir Abas provided a copy of his interview with the  Appellant  and  his
    reasons for deciding that he was a national of  Afghanistan  were  both
    cogent and detailed.

9.   The Appellant does not submit that he is entitled to  protection  under
    the  Refugee  Convention  or  subsidiary  protection  in  the  form  of
    Humanitarian Protection. The sole issue in this appeal is  whether  the
    Appellant is entitled to leave to remain under paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
    on  the  basis  that  there  are  very  significant  obstacles  to  him
    integrating in Afghanistan if he is returned there as a young adult.

10.  As a consequence, the recent case of  R (on the application of  HN  and
    SA) (Afghanistan) v Secretary of Staet for the Home  Department  [2016]
    EWCA Civ 123 does not serve as a precedent. In that case the Appellants
    were challenging  the  failure  by  the  Respondent  to  treat  further
    submissions as a  fresh  claim  to  protection  in  the  light  of  the
    worsening security situation in Afghanistan.  They  submitted  that  in
    the light of this situation they were entitled to protection under  the
    EU Qualification Directive 2004/83/EC on the basis  that  there  was  a
    serious and individual threat to their lives or persons  by  reason  of
    indiscriminate violence in a  situation  of  armed  internal  conflict.
    This is not the  claim  being  made  by  the  Appellant.  Although  the
    security situations is one of the background factors in this case.

11.  In JS (former  unaccompanied  child  -  durable  solution)  Afghanistan
    [2013] UKUT  00568  (IAC)  the  Upper  Tribunal  held  that  where  the
    appellant is no longer a minor, the duty  on  the  Secretary  of  State
    under s55 of the Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009  no
    longer arises but when making the assessment of whether  removal  would
    lead to a breach of article 8 all relevant factors must be  taken  into
    account including age, background,  length  of  residence  in  the  UK,
    family and general circumstances including any particular vulnerability
    and whether the appellant will have family or other  adult  support  on
    return to his home country appropriate to his particular needs.

12.  During the hearing of this appeal, counsel for the Appellant  confirmed
    that he was not relying on Article 8 of  the  ECHR  but,  as  paragraph
    276ADE was designed to reflect the private life  duties  arising  under
    Article 8, these factors are also relevant in this appeal.

13.  This is reflected in the IDI on Family Reunion, which states  that  the
    factors to be considered in relation to  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  include
    cultural ones, the length of time the Appellant had lived in the United
    Kingdom and  whether  he  has  a  network  of  family  and  friends  in
    Afghanistan. In the current case, the Appellant had maintained  contact
    in the United Kingdom with other young people of Afghan origin and  had
    lived in Afghanistan until he was 17. Therefore, it  is  reasonable  to
    assume that he has retained some cultural ties with  that  country.  In
    addition, he has only been here since 27 November 2011 and arrived here
    at the age of 17. Therefore, he has not lived here very long  and  came
    here a year before he became an adult.

14.  It is also the Appellant's case that he does not have any relatives  or
    friends who would assist him if he is removed to Afghanistan  but  this
    is disputed by the Respondent. In his witness statement, dated 29  June
    2015, the Appellant said that he had not heard from his family for  six
    years and did not know where they were. His assertion that  he  has  no
    contact with  his  family  was  supported  by  Linda  Morgan,  who  was
    previously his foster carer, when she gave oral evidence on  the  first
    day of the hearing. This was based on what he  had  told  her  and  her
    knowledge of his reactions to events.

15.  Counsel for the Appellant correctly submitted that I  must  assess  the
    individual  facts  of  the  Appellant's  case  and  not  just  rely  on
    suppositions. Therefore, I have considered the evidence  given  by  the
    Appellant in the light of the background evidence  about  the  outcomes
    for young adults returned to Afghanistan. I have also  reminded  myself
    that the appropriate  standard  of  proof  is  that  of  a  balance  of
    probabilities. There was a significant amount of objective and academic
    evidence in the Appellant's Consolidated Bundle  and  the  Respondent's
    Bundle, which I have read and considered.

16.  In his screening interview the Appellant said that he could not  return
    to Afghanistan because of his enemies, the Tarakheel, who were in Kabul
    and that they had confiscated his family  home  and  that  all  of  his
    family had escaped. However, it was  also  his  case  that  his  father
    travelled back to Afghanistan and was there when he left for the United
    Kingdom.  Therefore,  it  may  be  the  case  that  his  father  is  in
    Afghanistan or, at least, visits it on a regular basis.

17.   In addition the Appellant had previously said that his brother in  law
    was in the Afghan army and  paid  for  him  to  travel  to  the  United
    Kingdom.   He did not explain why he is not able to contact him or  his
    sister, when the nature of his brother in law's employment is likely to
    make tracing him  less  difficult.  In  his  screening  interview,  the
    Appellant also said that he had two brothers, one of whom was 25  years
    old at that time and that he had  two  sisters  who  were  married  and
    living in Afghanistan. In his substantive interview he  also  confirmed
    that his sisters were not in Pakistan. No explanation has been given as
    to why he would not  be  able  to  approach  them  for  assistance  and
    support.

18.  I also remind myself in EU (Afghanistan) & Others v Secretary of  State
    for the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  32  Sir  Stanley  Burnton
    mentioned a point made by the Secretary of State, which  he  considered
    to have substance. This was that "unaccompanied children who arrive  in
    this country from Afghanistan have done so as the  result  of  someone,
    presumably their families, paying for their fare and/or for a so-called
    agent to arrange for their journey to this country. Costs  incurred  by
    the family will have been considerable, relative to the wealth  of  the
    average Afghan family.  The motivation for their  incurring  that  cost
    may be that their child faces risk if he or she remains in Afghanistan,
    or it may simply be that they believe that  their  child  will  have  a
    better life in  this  country".   This  was  said  in  the  context  of
    arguments about the duty which may fall on the Secretary  of  State  to
    trace an unaccompanied asylum seeking child's family but it may also be
    of relevance whether it is really the case that a young person and  his
    family have not kept in touch.

19.  I have also taken into account the fact that both the Respondent and  a
    First-tier Tribunal Judge have doubted the Appellant's credibility  and
    that he now seeks to rely on a bare assertion that he is no  longer  in
    touch with his family. Taking all of this into account and applying the
    necessary balance of probabilities, I find that the Appellant  has  not
    established that he does not have any family members in Afghanistan.

20.  However, I am aware from some of the evidence given in this case,  even
    if he has family there, they may not wish to support him. Linda  Morgan
    said in evidence that another of her foster children had returned  home
    to visit his mother and sister on two occasions but had been  asked  to
    leave as his mother who thought that he was placing them at  risk.  The
    Refugee Support Network report entitled After Return:  Documenting  the
    Experiences of Young  People  Forcibly  Returned  to  Afghanistan  also
    addressed the question of whether young people would  be  supported  by
    their families on return. It noted that at least four young people, who
    were able to  find  their  parents,  spoke  of  being  confronted  with
    hostility and disappointment when they returned to their  families.  It
    explained that this was because these families  were  often  living  in
    poverty and were sometimes still indebted from  financing  the  initial
    migration of the young returnee.  Therefore,  the  families'  resources
    were under strain. It also added  that  "where  there  is  evidence  of
    family living in Afghanistan, the level of support young returnees  are
    able to receive from them is  inconsistent.  The  simple  existence  of
    family in Afghanistan does not equate to protection for the returnees".
    However, the report also indicates that 12 of  the  25  returnees  were
    able to rely on support from their families.

21.  If it is the case that  the  Appellant  does  have  family  members  in
    Afghanistan, I have taken into account that at the point  at  which  he
    left Afghanistan, he had a brother in law in the  Army,  a  father  who
    travelled between Pakistan and Afghanistan and another sister  who  was
    married and lived in Afghanistan. The Appellant has not  explained  why
    they would not support him if he returned to Afghanistan.

22.  In the alternative, I have considered whether he could seek  assistance
    from friends. Counsel for the Appellant submitted  that  the  Appellant
    had spent the formative years of his adolescence in the United  Kingdom
    and that, therefore, his personal social networks in Afghanistan  would
    be a lot less than older individuals who had applied for  asylum  here.
    However, the Appellant did not challenge his age assessment  before  me
    and therefore, the factual matrix of this appeal is that he  spent  the
    first seventeen years of his life in Afghanistan and the next two years
    of his adolescence in the United Kingdom. In  addition,  the  Appellant
    had been in  school  in  Kabul  until  5th  grade  and  had  only  left
    Afghanistan at the age of 17 but did not explain why he could not  seek
    out the assistance of any old friends. He would not be  hindered  by  a
    language barrier as he accepted  that  he  speaks  Pushto  and,  as  he
    attended school until 5th grade, he is likely to have some  ability  at
    least to read and write in this language.

23.  It was also submitted that, as a young adult, the  Appellant  would  be
    less able to cope if removed to  Afghanistan  and  I  have  taken  into
    account paragraph 18 of KA (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 1014, in which Lord Justice Maurice Kay
    held that:

         "At this point, it is appropriate to refer to what I may call  "the
         eighteenth birthday point".  Although  the  duty  to  endeavour  to
         trace does not endure beyond the date  when  an  applicant  reaches
         that age, it cannot be the case that  the  assessment  of  risk  on
         return is subject to such a bright line  rule.   The  relevance  of
         this relates to the definition of a "particular social  group"  for
         asylum purposes. In DS, Lloyd  LJ  considered  LQ  (Age:  immutable
         characteristic) Afghanistan [2008] UKAIT 00005  in  which  the  AIT
         held that "for these purposes age is immutable", in the sense that,
         although one's age is constantly  changing,  one  is  powerless  to
         change it oneself.  Lloyd LJ said (at paragraph 54): "that leaves a
         degree of uncertainty as to the definition of a  particular  social
         group.  Does membership cease on the day of the person's eighteenth
         birthday?  It is not easy to see that risks of the relevant kind to
         who as a child would continue until the eve of that  birthday,  and
         cease at once the next day." Given that the kinds of risk in  issue
         include the  forced  recruitment  or  the  sexual  exploitation  of
         vulnerable young males, persecution is not respectful of  birthdays
         - apparent or assumed age is more important than chronological age.
          Indeed, as submissions developed there seemed to be  a  degree  of
         common ground derived from the observation of Lloyd LJ"

24.  However, in this case the Appellant has  not  asserted  that  he  fears
    forced recruitment or  sexual  or  other  forms  of  exploitation.  His
    concern is that he will not be able to integrate into Afghan society.

25.   Professor  Clayton  asserted  that  the  Appellant  faced   the   same
    challenges returning to Afghanistan, as a young man of nearly 22, as he
    would have done as a child and referred me to passages relating to  the
    situation facing children  in  the  UNHCR  Eligibility  Guidelines  for
    Assessing the International Protection  Needs  of  Asylum-seekers  from
    Afghanistan. However, the categories of risk contained in that part  of
    the Guidelines were  defined  as  bonded  or  hazardous  child  labour,
    violence against children, systematic denial of  access  to  education,
    abductions, punishment and reprisals. There was no evidence to  suggest
    that such risks applied to the Appellant. In addition, the position  of
    someone who is now very nearly 22  years  old  is  likely  to  be  very
    different to someone who is just 18 and no evidence was put  before  me
    to show that the Appellant had any special needs which  would  indicate
    that this was not the case.

26.  I have also considered the Appellant's  case  in  the  context  of  him
    being forcibly returned as a former unaccompanied asylum seeking child.
    The Home Office Presenting Officer relied on a number of reports  which
    indicated that a large number of individuals and families had been able
    to return to Afghanistan and  re-integrate  there.  In  particular,  he
    noted  that  data  compiled  by  the  International  Organization   for
    Migration ("IOM")  showed  that,  between  January  and  November  2015
    83,128, individuals returned to Afghanistan on a  voluntary  basis  and
    that 11,914 were deported there; of which 1,525 were assisted  by  IOM.
    The figures also showed  that  6  individuals  from  the  UK  had  been
    provided with re-integration assistance in January to  March  2016  but
    there was no information as to whether any of these returnees had  been
    former unaccompanied children.

27.  The Home Office Presenting Officer  also  relied  on  an  IOM  document
    entitled Afghanistan: Migration profile and published in 2014. At  page
    185 it stated that IS Academy Survey data showed that the  majority  of
    households who returned strongly  disagreed  with  the  statement  that
    return migrants do not fit into their community. Moreover,  over  three
    quarters argued that returning migrants brought  new  ideas,  knowledge
    and technologies to  Afghanistan.   The  report  also  said  that  "the
    migration experience does not seem to lead to a decrease in the  social
    integration of the return  migrants  in  their  original  community  in
    Afghanistan. Upon return, almost 90 per cent of migrants feel very much
    a part of the community in which they live.... However,  the  migration
    experience itself appear to subjectively  alienate  people  from  their
    original community".

28.  In addition, the Home Office Presenting Officer  noted  that  Table  73
    that 58.5 % of returnees were coping, 16.7% were living comfortably and
    1.4% were living very comfortably and only 3.3% were  finding  it  very
    difficult and only 20.1% were finding it difficult. However, this  data
    does not distinguish between those returning as individuals  and  those
    returning as part of a family. It also does not indicate whether any of
    these returnees had previously  been  unaccompanied  migrant  children.
    Therefore, this evidence was not of direct relevance to  the  issue  in
    this appeal.

29.  I considered that content of Refugee Support  Network's  report  Broken
    futures: young Afghan asylum seekers in the UK and in their country  of
    origin, dated August 2012. But all of the young people interviewed  for
    the report were still in the UK.  But  I  have  given   weight  to  the
    contents  of  its  report  entitled  After  Return:   Documenting   the
    Experiences of Young People Forcibly Removed to Afghanistan' . This  is
    because, although the Refugee Support Network is based in  London,  its
    employees have visited Afghanistan on a  regular  basis  and  the  data
    contained in the Report was compiled by their Monitoring Officer, Abdul
    Ghafoor, who is based in Kabul.

30.  The RSN undertook detailed research between  March  2014  and  December
    2015 into the outcomes for  25  young  people  who  had  been  forcibly
    returned to Afghanistan. ( 29 young people were  in  contact  with  its
    Monitoring Officer during this period. However, three  of  these  young
    people could only be contacted once and a fourth had been over 18  when
    he had initially arrived in the United Kingdom.)

31.  But this sample needs to be considered in the light of  the  fact  that
    Home Office data, which was provided in  response  to  a  parliamentary
    question tabled by Louise Haigh M. P., and indicates  that  since  2007
    2,018 former unaccompanied asylum seeking children have  been  forcibly
    returned to Afghanistan. In particular, 269 were returned in 2013,  154
    in 2014 and 57 in 2015. Therefore, the number of young people monitored
    by the Refugee Support Network was relatively small.  It  is  also  the
    case that their experiences did differ.

32.  The evidence suggests that  there  is  some  immediate  assistance  for
    young people who are  forcibly  returned  but  that  not  all  of  them
    accepted this assistance. Linda  Morgan  said  in  evidence  that  when
    another of her foster children was forcibly removed to Afghanistan,  he
    was provided with accommodation for two weeks.  He  was  then  given  a
    further �100.   In contrast, Professor Clayton said that  she  knew  of
    two young people who had not been able to access the  hostel.  But  she
    did not provide any details of their cases.

33.  It was clear from the RSN report that 13 of the young people  monitored
    had not heard that they could stay in a hostel  for  a  short  time  as
    someone who had forcibly been returned to Afghanistan. But  this  would
    not be the case, if the Appellant were removed, as the availability  of
    this accommodation is now known to him. The Report also  said  that  11
    young people had decided not to stay there as they were afraid of being
    identified as a "returnee" and I  return  to  this  issue  below.   One
    further young person had decided not to stay there  but  to  stay  with
    some friends.

34.  The RSN report also confirmed that the majority  of  the  young  people
    who needed to travel to another province from  Kabul  on  their  return
    were provided with the necessary cash to do so.

35.  In her oral evidence Linda Morgan confirmed that another of her  foster
    carers had been given �10  when  he  arrived  in  Afghanistan  and  had
    subsequently been given �100 to buy equipment but had  to  wait  for  a
    long time for this and believed that the process was corrupt.

36.  In terms of on-going support, the RSN report noted that only 4  out  of
    10 of the young people, who applied for assistance, were able to access
    funding to set up a business or further their education.  But  it  also
    explained that in 2 of the remaining 6  cases  this  was  because  they
    could not provide evidence of having a business partner  and  a  viable
    business plan. For three others the administrative processes  had  been
    impossible to navigate. It also noted that two  young  people  who  had
    used reintegration finance from IOM or loans from friends or family  to
    purchase taxis explained that generalised unemployment  had  also  made
    this an over-saturated market...and neither had been  able  to  sustain
    their taxi business. The Appellant has not established  that  he  would
    not be able to set himself up in another  form  of  business  with  the
    skills which he had gained here.

37.  In relation to finding work, Linda Morgan  said  that  another  of  her
    foster children had earned a very minimum amount of money cleaning  car
    windows, clearing snow and selling fruit but that  he  would  not  have
    been able to pay for a room and training courses and learning to  drive
    without her sending him about �300 every  couple  of  months.  The  RSN
    report also found that "the most successful approach  to  finding  work
    for young returnees has been through personal connections,  with  seven
    of the 12 young people who found at  least  a  few  days  of  temporary
    manual labour doing so this way". In contrast, only two of the 13 young
    people who attempted  to  secure  employment  by  contacting  employers
    directly have managed to do so". It also found that "none  of  the  six
    young returnees who had tried to make  use  of  third  party  services,
    including NGOs, to find work had been successful".

38.   But  the  report  also  noted  that  young  people  had   demonstrated
    significant determination, attempting to earn a living (or be  provided
    with accommodation and food) by washing dishes; picking fruit; driving;
    guarding or washing cars; selling vegetables from a  cart;  working  in
    small shops, on construction sites, in factories; and  repairing  items
    included fridges and roofs".  Again the Appellant has  not  established
    that he would not be able to find work relying on his own skills or the
    assistance of any friends or relatives.

39.  In relation to the difficulties which may be  faced  as  a  "returnee",
    the RSN report five young person may incur as a  "returnee".  It  noted
    that five young people talked about being  made  redundant  or  refused
    employment when it emerged that they were a returnee.  But  the  report
    also referred to Jalalabad being the single most lived-in locations for
    the young people and that one such returnee  had  said  that  this  was
    because it was cheap.

40.   The  difficulties  faced  by  a  young  returnee  were  documented  in
    Professor Clayton's 2011 Hamdullah: The Road Hone.   Professor  Clayton
    is now a Professor of Media and Communications at  Goldsmiths  College,
    which is part of the University of London. She has also  a  history  of
    work as a journalist looking at the issues facing unaccompanied migrant
    children. Therefore, I have given weight to the content of  this  film.
    However, I also note that in his written submissions  counsel  for  the
    Appellant accepted that the IDI on  Family  Reunion  stated  that  when
    "considering  whether  there  are   very   significant   obstacles   to
    integration, the decision maker should consider whether  the  applicant
    has the ability to form an adequate private life by  the  standards  of
    the country of return - not by UK standards".

41.  The film is a compassionate exposition of the plight of a young  Afghan
    man returned to Afghanistan at the age of 18.  It showed  that  housing
    and the environment in Afghanistan was very different to that the young
    man had experienced in foster care in  Kent.  However,  this  does  not
    equate with there being very significant obstacles to  integration.  In
    addition, the film confirmed that, after Hamadullah had been  returned,
    he  had  been  taken  in  by  some  students  who  provided  him   with
    accommodation and assistance for some months.

42.  When they returned home during the winter, he  lost  his  accommodation
    but was able to obtain basic accommodation in  an  abandoned  building.
    He had to use a lamp but he was able to access water from a local  well
    and the footage showed him engaging with local children when he did so.
    There was also film of him going to local markets  where  there  was  a
    variety of local food on sale. The film did not show him being  shunned
    or threatened by local people even though at times he was not  covering
    his head and was merely wearing jeans and shirt.   He  was  undoubtedly
    lonely at times and was struggling to find a job but the film indicated
    that he was able to survive there albeit not at the  same  standard  of
    living as here.

43.  The Appellant also relied on an excerpt from an ITN News  at  Ten  item
    on the deportation of former child asylum seekers, which was  broadcast
    on 9 December 2015.  The footage  showed  a  young  man  who  had  been
    returned from the United Kingdom living in  poor  housing  but  he  was
    dressed in traditional Afghan clothing and was  seen  interacting  with
    local people and the overall impression  was  that  he  was  surviving,
    albeit with difficulty.

44.  The Appellant also  relied  on  the  UNHCR  Guidance  which  stated  at
    paragraph A 1 (j) that  anti-government  elements  ("AGEs")  reportedly
    target individuals who are perceived  to  have  adopted  values  and/or
    appearances associated with Western countries,  due  to  their  imputed
    support for the Government and the international community.  This was a
    finding  which  had  been  drawn  from  the  Bureau  of   Investigative
    Journalism's report From Kent  to  Kabul:  The  Former  Asylum  Seeking
    Children Sent Back to Afghanistan, which had been published on 17  July
    2015.  This report was not in the Consolidated Bundle but there was  an
    extract from its website entitled Long Read: From Kent to Kabul  -  The
    Westernised Young Men Being Deported to Afghanistan. It referred  to  a
    young man being returned to Afghanistan after spending six years in the
    United Kingdom as an unaccompanied child who had told the  Bureau  that
    when he returned to "Afghanistan it was the worst situation of my life.
    No one helped me at all because I was  completely  different  ...I  was
    strange to them and they were for me. I dressed differently  and  ended
    up living in a derelict warehouse". He also told them it  that  he  had
    been kidnapped by thieves who demanded he pay a ransom to be  released.
    But he also said that after paying a portion of the demanded  money  he
    managed to escape.

45.  The effect of return was also addressed in  the  article  What  happens
    post-deportation? The experiences of deported Afghans, by Lisa Schuster
    and N. Majidi, which appeared in Migration Studies. This is an  article
    by two experienced academics. Based on interviews conducted with  young
    Afghan men, they argued that" the experience  of  removal  [which  they
    refer to as deportation] is likely to make adjustment, integration,  or
    integration difficult if not impossible, and creates  three  additional
    reasons to re-migrate. These  include  deepening  economic  opportunity
    losses and the impossibility of repaying debts incurred by the  initial
    departure, the social existence or lack thereof  of  transnational  and
    local ties and responsibilities and finally the socio-cultural shame of
    failure and the suspicions of the community".

46.  This was based on a belief that "families are increasingly  sending  to
    Europe at least one of their sons as an investment  in  their  future".
    There was nothing in the Appellant's evidence to suggest that this  was
    the case. It was not his case that he had been sending  money  back  to
    them or that he owed a debt to his brother-in-law.

47.  The article did not  say  that  all  returnees  failed  to  thrive  and
    mentioned one young returnee who "used his English language  skills  to
    turn his forced return into a positive and thriving social and economic
    experience at home". Majid also mentioned those who had  been  able  to
    establish businesses with the assistance of the IOM.

48.  The article did confirm that those returned  were  likely  to  try  and
    migrate again. This mirrored conclusions in the RSN report, which  said
    that six young people were known to have left Afghanistan  despite  the
    risks of undertaking a further journey and one other had  made  several
    unsuccessful attempts to do so. In addition, it noted that 15 of the 25
    young people had reported that leaving again was their priority and six
    of them had specific plans of how to do so. However, the motivation for
    doing so was mixed and did not solely relate  to  difficulties  in  re-
    integration. I note that Linda Morgan's other foster child had  decided
    to leave Afghanistan despite being provided with financial  support  to
    obtain accommodation and re-training.

49.  Professor Clayton also provided two short  letters  and  in  the  first
    letter she had included electronic links to some background evidence. I
    have referred to the content  of  these  links  where  relevant  to  my
    decision. In her oral evidence she made further observations which were
    not covered in other published reports.

50.  Counsel for the Appellant  accepted  that  Professor  Clayton  had  not
    provided an expert report but submitted that she was an expert witness.
    I accept that she is a Professor at Goldsmiths College, which  is  part
    of the University of London, but  she  is  a  Professor  of  Media  and
    Communications as opposed to an expert on Afghanistan and her expertise
    arises from her film-making and direct contact with  young  Afghan  men
    about to be removed from the United Kingdom. But this is the  limit  of
    her expertise.

51.  She said in oral evidence that she has never visited that  country  but
    instead had "briefed film crews" travelling there  on  her  behalf.  In
    addition, although she said in her letter, dated 22  April  2016,  that
    she had been involved in research on the  welfare  of  separated  child
    asylum seekers for the past fifteen years  and  had  been  tracking  55
    young people forcibly returned to Afghanistan, she has yet  to  publish
    this research. I note that she co-hosted a conference  entitled  Facing
    the Abyss; Exploring the  Challenges  for  separated  children  seeking
    asylum when they turn 18 but there was no report of this conference  or
    its outcomes in the Consolidated Bundle.

52.  In paragraph 23 of HN & SA McCombe LJ referred to a letter  written  by
    Professor Clayton and noted that she had not explained her  methodology
    and made a comparison between Kabul and a Western city which was not  a
    material comparison.  It was also my  experience  that  she  tended  to
    assert that if conditions were not comparable to those experienced here
    a young person could not be returned to Afghanistan. This was odds with
    the written submissions made by counsel for the Appellant in  which  he
    accepted that the IDI on Family Reunion  stated  that  "in  considering
    whether there  are  very  significant  obstacles  to  integration,  the
    decision maker should consider whether the applicant has the ability to
    form an adequate private life by the standards of the country of return
    - not by UK standards".

53.  Professor Clayton also made a number of criticisms of the  Respondent's
    failure to conduct research into the outcomes of  former  unaccompanied
    children removed to Afghanistan. However, the burden of proof  lies  on
    the Appellant and there is no obligation on the Respondent to undertake
    research into particular groups of returnees. Furthermore, in  National
    Justice CIA Naviera SA v Prudential Assurance Company Limited [1993]  2
    Lloyds Reports 68 Cresswell J found at pages 81 - 82 that;

         "The duties and responsibilities of expert witnesses in civil cases
         include the following:

         2.   An expert witness should provide independent assistance to the
             court by way of objective  unbiased  opinion  in  relation  to
             matters within his expertise...An expert witness in  the  High
             Court should never assume the role of an advocate".

54.  It is my  view  that  on  a  number  of  occasions  during  her  cross-
    examination Professor Clayton crossed the line between independence and
    advocacy. This was particularly the case when she criticised inactivity
    on behalf of the Home Office and previous decisions  by  the  Tribunal.
    Therefore, the weight which I place on  her  evidence  is  that  to  be
    ascribed to a witness who has worked with this group  of  young  people
    and has read research on the subject but not that of an expert witness.



55.  In her oral evidence she asserted that these young people  had  made  a
    life style choice as they had adopted British life and Christianity and
    saw themselves as British.  This does not support the Appellant's  case
    that there would be very significant obstacles to  him  integrating  in
    Afghanistan.

56.  The Home Office Presenting Officer also relied on the fact  that  there
    is an Assisted Voluntary Return  package,  which  the  Appellant  could
    benefit from. In her oral evidence, Professor Clayton said that in  her
    view former unaccompanied children viewed applying for such  a  package
    as an admission that they had no basis for claiming  asylum  and  were,
    therefore, not keen to do so.   She  also  asserted  that  these  young
    people were also aware from social media networks that the package  was
    not delivered. In addition, Linda  Morgan  said  that  another  of  her
    foster children had not sought assistance under the Assisted  Voluntary
    Return programme as they were not able to find  any  positive  feedback
    about the programme.

57.  However, in the current case the Appellant is no longer asserting  that
    he is at risk of persecution in Afghanistan. It was also asserted  that
    young people did not receive the promised support  under  this  Scheme.
    However, the majority of the evidence submitted related  to  those  who
    had been forcibly returned to Afghanistan and who were not entitled  to
    assistance under this scheme.  The Appellant did not  put  forward  any
    other reasons for not applying for assistance under the  Scheme,  which
    would potentially assist him to re-integrate in Afghanistan  and  which
    would amount to �500 on arrival and up to �1,500 at a later date. Linda
    Morgan's evidence indicates that such sums could assist him to obtain a
    room and pay for training course, albeit for a short period of time.

58.  Even if he were to be forcibly returned, he would be able to apply  for
    the package of support provided by the International  Organization  for
    Migration. This includes small amounts of cash for onward  travel  from
    Kabul, accommodation in a hostel, called Jangalak, for up to two  years
    and "in-kind" reintegration assistance up to the value of �750 to  help
    them set up a business or up to �900 to cover the cost of  training  or
    education. In her evidence Professor Clayton asserted that the BBC crew
    filming Hamdullah: The Road Home had  visited  a  "return  centre"  and
    found that returnees were not being given the career support and  money
    promised. However, she did not name this  centre  or  explain  why  the
    support and money were not being provided. Other evidence  referred  to
    above indicates that the substance of this support is available, albeit
    with conditions, such as the provision of a business plan.

59.  There was also a letter  of  support  from  a  project  worker  at  The
    Children's Society, dated 9 January 2015, but it did  not  address  the
    issues of whether there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellant re-integrating in Afghanistan.

60.  Taking all of the above evidenced into account and applying  a  balance
    of probabilities, I find that the Appellant has  not  established  that
    his  individual  circumstances  are  such  that  there  would  be  very
    significant obstacles to him being able to re-integrate in  Afghanistan
    if he were removed there.

DECISION

    The Appellant's appeal is  dismissed  under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.
