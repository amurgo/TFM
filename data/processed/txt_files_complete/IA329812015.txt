Representation:

For the Respondent:    Mr A McVettey, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction.

    1. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal has been granted to the
       appellant against the dismissal of her appeal by Judge of the First
       tier Tribunal Fox.


    2. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born in August 1978. She came
       to the United Kingdom on a visit visa in July 2008 and then
       overstayed. On 4 August 2011 she applied for leave to remain on the
       basis of article 8. This was refused with no right of appeal. She
       then requested reconsideration on 21st December 2011 which was
       refused on 29 September 2015. That decision conferred a right of
       appeal.

    3. The basis of her claim was that she has a partner, Mr Jason Mills
       who is a British national. The application was considered under
       appendix FM. It was accepted she met the suitability requirements.
       It was accepted that she met R-LTRP 1.1. (d)(ii). The issue was
       whether paragraph EX 1 (b) applied, namely, that she had a genuine
       and subsisting relationship with the British partner and there were
       insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing outside the
       United Kingdom. The respondent took the view that she and her
       partner could live in Nigeria. The partner said he had never been to
       Nigeria but the respondent said she could help him adjust. The
       couple were undergoing fertility treatment in the United Kingdom but
       this was also available in Nigeria.

    4. Regarding private life she had not been here the necessary 20 years
       required under paragraph 276 ADE of the immigration rules. The
       respondent did not accept there were very significant obstacles to
       her integration back into Nigeria.

    5.  No exceptional circumstances were identified justifying a
       freestanding article 8 right to remain.

The First tier Tribunal

    6. There was no presenting officer in attendance before First-tier
       Judge Fox. At paragraphs 5 to 7 the judge set out the principal case
       law relating to article 8 as incorporated in appendix FM and on a
       freestanding basis and referred to the decisions on section 117 B of
       the 2002 Act. At paragraphs 22 to 27 the judge set out his findings.




    7. He commenced by stating that her claim in relation to return to
       Nigeria and her partner's ability to join her, amounted to no more
       than matters of personal convenience. The judge referred to the
       appellant entering on a temporary basis and her partner being aware
       of her precarious status. The judge referred to section 117 B. The
       judge stated there was no evidence to demonstrate why the appellant
       could not return to Nigeria and apply for entry clearance from
       there. The judge pointed out she had no entitlement to the medical
       services she had received to date in the United Kingdom and that
       there was provision for fertility treatment in Nigeria.


The Upper Tribunal.

    8. Permission to appeal was granted on the basis the judge failed to
       provide a structured assessment in line with the Razgar sequential
       approach for an article 8 assessment. The grant of leave referred to
       an attendant brevity of findings and a lack of reasoning or
       consideration of the immigration rules.


    9. The appeal was opposed by the respondent and the rule 24 response
       submitted that the judge had directed himself appropriately. It was
       contended that the decision did address the rules as well as a
       freestanding article 8 assessment.

   10.  In the appellant's statement she sets out how she was put in
       contact with her partner and they telephoned each other. She came to
       the United Kingdom in 2007 to meet him and then returned to Nigeria.
       When she came back in 2008 they resume their relationship and have
       been together since.  She says she is receiving fertility treatment
       at the hospital in Manchester and that she suffered a miscarriage in
       May 2016.

   11. At hearing the appellant's representative relied on the grant of
       permission to appeal. He submitted there was no detailed
       consideration of the proportionality of the decision in line with
       the Razgar approach. He referred to the length of the relationship
       and submitted it would be harsh to expect the appellant's partner to
       go to Nigeria. He was in full-time employment here.

   12. The present officer referred me to the high threshold indicated in
       the case law. For instance, in Agyarko & Ors, R (on the application
       of) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 440 the Court of Appeal referred to a
       party who had overstayed unlawfully and  formed a relationship with
       a British citizen who then sought leave to remain, as is the case
       here. The "insurmountable obstacles" test under the Immigration
       Rules was a stringent test and more demanding than a mere test of
       whether it would be reasonable to expect a couple to continue their
       family life outside the United Kingdom.However,the test was to be
       interpreted in a sensible and practical rather than purely literal
       way.

   13. The Supreme Court (R -v- Agyarko and Ikuga [2017] UKSC 11) referred
       to the respondent's instructions to caseworkers who are required to
       consider the seriousness of the difficulties. Relevant factors where
       the ability of the parties to enter and stay in the country
       concerned; cultural and religious barriers and the impact on any
       disability. At paragraph 42 Supreme Court referred to the Grand
       Chamber decision of Jeunesse in relation to insurmountable
       obstacles. Relevant was the extent to which family life would
       effectively be ruptured; the ties with the contracting State; the
       obstacles to the family living in the country of origin and the need
       for immigration control. The Supreme Court referred to the need for
       a practical and realistic approach and that the issue was not
       whether it was literally impossible for a family to live together.

   14. The presenting officer submitted that the fact that a partner had
       employment or family here or that a move would be inconvenient was
       generally not be sufficient. Whilst the decision of Immigration
       Judge Fox was brief he contended that it was difficult to see how
       the appellant could have otherwise succeeded, particularly having
       regard to the provisions of section 117 B.

   15. The decision at paragraph 18 records a submission from the
       appellant's representatives that the insurmountable obstacles
       suggested consisted of her partner's employment and his status as a
       British citizen and the fact he had never travelled to Nigeria. The
       presenting officer submitted it was open to the appellant to return
       to Nigeria and her partner could support an application for entry
       clearance if the necessary requirements were met. Against this, the
       appellant's representative said there was no guaranteed such an
       application would succeed.

   16. While still dealing with the error of law issue I asked the parties
       if they were agreeable to me asking the appellant's partners some
       questions. No objection was raised. He confirmed he had never been
       married before and had no children. He said he enjoyed good health.
       He said he earned in excess of the ï¿½18,600 set out in the rules. He
       confirmed that his wife had been receiving fertility treatment
       provided by the National Health Service rather than privately.

Consideration

   17. The decision of First-tier Judge Fox is very brief. That is no fault
       and brevity is to be aspired to provide the decision adequately deal
       with the points arising. In this instance the decision would have
       benefited from greater structure.


   18. The grounds of appeal complain that the judge appeared to assume
       there were compelling circumstances justifying freestanding article
       8 assessment. Having done so, the judge did not follow the
       sequential steps in Razgar. I have difficulty seeing how an
       appellant can complain about a judge going on to consider a
       freestanding assessment if an appeal does not succeed under the
       rules.


   19. It would have been preferable for the judge to set out separately
       the immigration rules and then state why article 8 on a freestanding
       basis was being considered. However, in this instance this amounts
       to a matter of form. It is my conclusion it would have made no
       material difference to the outcome. The factual matrix is clear and
       the judge obviously grasped this.

   20. Essentially, the appellant came to the United Kingdom in 2008
       intending to resume her relationship with her partner by
       deliberately overstaying. He was aware of her precarious position.
       Whilst here she has sought to conceive and has availed of the
       National Health Service. She did not pay for what undoubtedly
       expensive treatment. I acknowledge that she did try to regularise
       her situation in 2011 but this was unsuccessful.

   21. The immigration rules are meant to be article 8 compliant. There
       were similarities between the issue of significant obstacles under
       paragraph 276 ADE (vi) and the question of insurmountable obstacles
       to family life in EX (1(b) of appendix FM. At paragraph 5 the judge
       refers to article 8 being codified in the rules. The judge set out
       the relevant arguments in relation to insurmountable obstacles at
       paragraph 18 and the question of integration at paragraph 19. He
       also sets out the basis for a freestanding assessment at paragraph
       20. In the findings the judge does roll all the matters together and
       it is here that a separate structure would have been preferable.
       Ultimately however it is clear what factors were taken into
       consideration. In particular, the judge was influenced by the abuse
       of immigration control by the appellant and the connivance in this
       by her partner. The judge referred to the section 117 B factors:
       principally, the parties' awareness of their situation. Whilst the
       judge did not formally go through the sequential approach of Razgar
       the existence of family life was accepted and he progressed to the
       final determinative issue of proportionality.


   22. In conclusion, whilst the decision would have benefited from a more
       structured approach the essential points were set out .On the facts
       the conclusion was one open to the judge.

Decision

I find no material error of law established in the decision of First tier
Judge Fox. Consequently, that decision, dismissing the appellant's appeal
shall stand.
