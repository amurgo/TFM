                                AAMIR SALEEM
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent

                           DECISION ON ABANDONMENT


    1. The appellant's appeal against the decision of the respondent  dated
       17 July 2013 to make a deportation order against him pursuant to the
       automatic deportation provisions of the  UK  Borders  Act  2007  was
       dismissed by a judge of the First-tier Tribunal after a  hearing  on
       20 August 2014. Permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal was granted by a judge of the Upper Tribunal  on
       11 February 2015.

    2. On 22 April 2015 there was a hearing before me pursuant to the grant
       of permission. At the conclusion  of  that  hearing  I  reserved  my
       decision in relation to whether there was an error  of  law  in  the
       decision of the First-tier Tribunal, and if so whether the  decision
       was to be set aside. I indicated to the parties that if I found that
       the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law such that the decision  was
       to be set aside, there would be a further  hearing  before  any  re-
       making of the decision in the Upper Tribunal.

    3. Subsequent to the hearing, on 11 June 2015 the  Upper  Tribunal  was
       notified  by  the  respondent  that  the  appellant  had  'signed  a
       disclaimer' indicating his intention to return to Pakistan. A letter
       from The Home Office to the Immigration  Enforcement  Department  of
       the Home Office was provided which repeated the same.  A  pro  forma
       notice  entitled  "Disclaimer  in  a  Deportation  Case"  was   also
       provided, signed by the appellant and  dated  5  June  2015.  A  box
       marked with an 'X' states:

             "I am aware that I have an outstanding right of appeal against
             my deportation but I wish nevertheless  to  leave  the  United
             Kingdom and waive this appeal right."

    4. On 16 June 2015, at my request, the appellant's representatives were
       contacted   by   the   Upper   Tribunal's   administration   seeking
       confirmation that the appellant wished to abandon  his  appeal.  The
       reply from the appellant's representatives, Good Advice UK, dated 22
       June 2015, states that the  appellant  had  elected  voluntarily  to
       return to Pakistan and that the flight was  scheduled  for  26  June
       2015, but that he does not wish to abandon  his  appeal.  The  Upper
       Tribunal was then informed by the respondent that the appellant  had
       been "removed" from the UK on 25 June 2015.

    5. Directions were then sent to the parties on 3  July  2015  requiring
       them to indicate whether they accept that by reason of the appellant
       having left the UK his appeal is  to  be  treated  as  abandoned  by
       virtue of section 104(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
       Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").

    6. The appellant's representatives responded on 7 July  repeating  that
       the appellant did not wish to abandon his appeal and stating that it
       was not accepted that the appeal should be treated as abandoned. The
       respondent replied on 14 July expressing the view  that  the  appeal
       was to be so treated. Neither party made any detailed submissions on
       the point.

    7. S.104(4) of the 2002 Act provides that:

             "An appeal under section 82(1) [of the 2002 Act] brought by  a
             person while he is in the United Kingdom shall be  treated  as
             abandoned if the appellant leaves the United Kingdom."

    8. However, Schedule 9, paragraph 47 of the Immigration Act 2014 amends
       s.104(4) of the 2002 Act by deleting it but with  saving  provisions
       set out in articles 9-11 of the Immigration Act  2014  (Commencement
       No.3, Transitional and Saving  Provisions)  Order  2014,  S.I.  2014
       No.2771. The effect of  the  savings  provisions  is  that  s.104(4)
       remains in force.

    9. Although there was a hearing before the Upper Tribunal on  22  April
       2015, there has been no determination of the appeal. The  appeal  is
       therefore still pending (s.104(1)-(2) of the 2002 Act).

   10. The result is that by reason of the appellant having left the UK his
       appeal is to be treated as abandoned  by  virtue  of  s.104(4).  The
       Upper Tribunal has no jurisdiction to  do  anything  other  than  to
       treat the appeal as abandoned.

Decision

      The appeal is abandoned by virtue of s.104(4) of the 2002 Act.
