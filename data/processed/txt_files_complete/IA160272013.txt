For the Respondent:    Ms Sreeraman, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nepal born on 23rd September 1956 and she
    applied for a residence card as confirmation of a right  to  reside  in
    the UK as  the  dependent  family  member  of  an  EEA  national  under
    Regulation 7(1)(c).  That application was refused on  23rd  April  2013
    because in the view of the respondent she had failed to demonstrate she
    was genuinely dependent on her EEA family member.  She claimed to  have
    entered the UK on 9th May 2012 having previously been refused visitor's
    leave on 2nd June 2009.  The application for  the  residence  card  was
    made on 12th October 2012.

 2. In the letter of refusal dated 23rd April 2013 it was stated  that  the
    appellant had not shown that she was living  with  or  was  financially
    dependent on her sponsor Pradip Budhathoki and Nirmala Budhathoki.

 3. Judge Davies of the  First-tier  Tribunal  heard  the  appeal  on  23rd
    January 2015 and dismissed that appeal on 6th February 2015.  He  found
    at paragraph 25 that given the assets  which  the  appellant  owned  in
    Nepal valued at around �120,000 in UK money in 2009 she could meet  her
    essential needs without the support of  her  son  and  daughter-in-law.
    She had accommodation and could  obtain  income  from  the  land.   She
    confirmed that her late husband had obtained an income from  the  land.
    He found that as recently as 2009 she declared her intention to  return
    to Nepal as she had valuable assets.  The judge  also  found  that  the
    credibility of the appellant and that  of  her  son  and  daughter  was
    undermined by their evidence in 2009.  It was  contended  that  as  she
    owned such valuable assets in Nepal it would not be credible to suggest
    she would not return.

 4. An application for permission was made to the First-tier Tribunal which
    was refused and then renewed to the Upper Tribunal which was granted by
    Upper Tribunal Judge Canavan.

 5. The application for permission to  appeal  cited  MR  and  Others  (EEA
    extended family members) Bangladesh [2010]  UKUT  449  which  confirmed
    that "dependency  had  to  be  genuine,  not  contrived  and  that  its
    interpretation had to be informed by the  principle  of  effectiveness"
    and Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013] UKUT 314 that there should be a
    holistic examination of  a  number  of  factors  "including  financial,
    physical and social conditions, so as to  establish  whether  there  is
    dependence that is genuine" and

         "the essential focus has to be on the nature  of  the  relationship
         concerned and on whether it is one characterised by a situation  of
         dependence based on an examination of all the factual circumstances
         bearing in mind the underlying objective of maintaining  the  unity
         of the family"

    and

         "the test is one of the present and not past dependency".

 6. Lebon C-316/85 [1987] ECR 2811 confirmed that  "there  is  no  need  to
    determine the reasons for recourse to that  support  or  to  raise  the
    question whether the person concerned is able  to  support  himself  by
    taking up paid employment".

 7. The application for permission to appeal submitted that at [25] of  his
    decision Judge Davies erred in assessing the appellant's dependency  as
    not genuine.  It was clear from the appellant's  bank  statements  that
    the financial support she received from her family and her husband  was
    not contrived as each credit was derived from them  and  there  was  no
    alternative income.  At question 8 of the  decision  Judge  Davies  had
    questioned large deposits made in  other  names  such  as  "Tara  Devi"
    despite testimony explaining the nature of how money was transferred to
    Nepal via agents.  The dependency was not contrived.

 8. Secondly, dependency was a present consideration and relevant as at the
    time of appeal.

 9. Third, there was no assessment  of  the  holistic  examination  of  the
    appellant's circumstances  with  regard  to  her  physical  and  social
    condition and Judge  Davies  placed  significance  on  the  appellant's
    ability to arrange the sale of property despite the fact that  she  was
    illiterate.  She would not  be  able  to  take  sufficient  actions  to
    generate an income.

10.  There  was  no  consideration  from  Judge  Davies  of  the  important
    underlying objective of maintaining the unit of the family as  set  out
    in Reyes.

11. Fifth, in Re J family life was protected by Article 8.

12. Sixth, family life would not normally exist  between  them  within  the
    meaning of Article 8 at all and  there  would  be  absence  of  further
    elements of dependency.

13. A Rule 24 response was served in which the respondent made  clear  that
    she opposed the appellant's appeal, save to say that the evidence found
    by the appellant and her supporters was not credible.

The Hearing

14. At the hearing  Miss  Norman  relied  on  her  grounds  of  appeal  and
    submitted that the  examination  of  dependency  by  the  claimant  was
    hypothetical  and  futuristic.   There  was  no  suggestion  that   the
    appellant had income other than the sponsor's since May 2012  when  she
    moved to the UK.  In relation  to  the  Immigration  Rules  it  may  be
    appropriate to consider future maintenance but that was not permissible
    under the EEA Regulations.  The judge did not look holistically at  the
    appellant's position and there was no investigation as to the  proposed
    sale of land or income.  The husband had previously paid a labourer and
    there was no firm finding in relation to income  from  the  land.   The
    judge did not look at the practical  considerations  of  restarting  an
    income.  The issue was  current  dependency.   This  was  a  depressed,
    illiterate woman and there was no explanation of  how  practically  she
    currently was deriving income from the land.

15. Ms Norman asserted that there was no consideration of Article 8  but  I
    pointed out that this was irrelevant as no Section 120 notice had  been
    served.

16. Ms Sreeraman stated that the judge had applied the principles in  Reyes
    and was entitled to make findings on the dependency.  There had been  a
    gap in remittances  of  eighteen  months  between  the  dates  of  14th
    November 2009 and 15th March 2011 and no  satisfactory  explanation  of
    this.  She had assets able to meet her needs and  the  judge  had  made
    reference to this at paragraphs 25  to  26.   The  judge  had  taken  a
    holistic approach.  Ms Sreeraman submitted there was  a  clear  finding
    there was income from land and little evidence as to  deterioration  of
    that land or the property on it.  The gap of eighteen  months  had  not
    been challenged by the appellant.

17. Miss Norman submitted that there was no suggestion the  land  presently
    provided a source of income or that the judge dealt  clearly  with  the
    testimony regarding the transferred money from agents.   There  was  no
    record of when payments were made and the amounts.

Conclusions

18. The respondent's case was summarised by the judge at paragraph 6  where
    he recorded that the appellant was not genuinely dependent on  her  son
    and daughter-in-law and the witnesses were not being truthful  and  had
    failed to provide evidence of genuine dependency.

19. Although the judge cites Reyes (EEA Regs: dependency) [2013]  UKUT  314
    (IAC) he does not appear to follow  it.   Reyes  provides  guidance  on
    dependency, and the judge correctly states that the test is  a  factual
    one which must not consist solely of a bare  calculation  of  financial
    dependency  but  should  holistically  examine  a  number  of   factors
    including financial, physical and social conditions should  assess  the
    present position and must not interpret the term so as to deprive it of
    its effectiveness.  However, at paragraph 16 the judge finds that

         "Given the assets which she owns in Nepal valued at around �120,000
         in UK money in 2009 she can meet her essential  needs  without  the
         support of her son and  daughter-in-law.   She  has  accommodation.
         She can obtain an income from the land.   She  confirmed  that  her
         late husband had obtained an income from the land.  While I  accept
         that the appellant may not have the skill or experience to  arrange
         either the sale of the assets or to arrange arrangements for income
         from the land it is likely that she  could  obtain  help  in  doing
         that.  As recently as 2009 she had declared her intention to return
         to Nepal as she had valuable assets".

20. The difficulty with this is that it is  framed  in  the  past  and  the
    future, not the present.  The judge at [10] recorded  evidence from the
    son to the effect that

         "There was no income from the land.   The  land  had  in  the  past
         provided food for the  family.   His  father  had  got  someone  to
         cultivate the land so as to provide some months of  food  from  the
         land.  Asked about his mother's statement that the  land  had  been
         farmed and that there was income from the land  he  said  that  she
         might have forgotten.  It would need considerable time for  him  to
         go to Nepal to sell the land for his mother".

    There was no finding as to the amount of income and  whether  this  was
    genuinely presently available.

21. In Lim (EEA dependency [2013] UKUT 00437 Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey
    considered at [25] the issue of dependency of choice in  that  he  made
    specific reference to choosing not to live off savings.  He had this to
    say

         "25.     Whilst the  jurisprudence  has  not  to  date  dealt  with
             dependency of choice in the form of choosing not to  live  off
             savings, it has expressly approved dependency of choice in the
             form of choosing not to take up employment:  see  above  Lebon
             [22].  I readily acknowledge that in SM  (India)  Sullivan  LJ
             saw it as possible that there was a  distinction  relating  to
             the situation of a claimant who preferred living  off  savings
             and a claimant who preferred not to work (see above [14]). But
             it is very difficult  to  discern  any  principled  basis  for
             differentiating between the two different forms of  dependency
             of choice when the test is simply a question of fact  and  the
             reasons why there is dependency  are  irrelevant.  Indeed,  if
             anything, one might have  thought  that  expecting  a  retired
             person  to  utilise  existing  financial  resources  after   a
             lifetime of work is more problematic than  expecting  a  young
             able bodied person to earn a wage". .

22. It is correct to say that for dependency to arise it is  not  necessary
    that the person be wholly or even mainly dependent if a person requires
    material support for essential needs in part that is sufficient.

23. Despite alluding to a holistic assessment the judge did not  appear  to
    undertake one.  I can accept that he made adverse credibility  findings
    and he might have found the evidence in  relation  to  income  and  the
    ability to derive income from the land not credible but there  were  no
    findings regarding the income from the land merely  that  it  could  be
    sold.  As Reyes makes clear  dependency  is  not  a  matter  merely  of
    financial dependency but a  question  of  essential  living  needs  and
    although the judge looked at the health of the appellant, there did not
    appear to be an overall assessment of her accommodation  and  financial
    requirements.   I therefore find an error of law which may be material.
     Article 8 is not relevant in this case. There is no Section 120 notice
    and no removal decision.

24. The Judge erred materially for the reasons identified. I set aside  the
    decision pursuant to Section  12(2)(a)  of  the  Tribunals  Courts  and
    Enforcement Act 2007 (TCE 2007).  Bearing in mind the nature and extent
    of the findings to be made the matter should be remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal under section 12(2) (b) (i) of the TCE 2007  and  further
    to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential Practice Statement.

25. No anonymity direction is made.
