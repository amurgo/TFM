                                   Between

                 Secretary of State for the Home Department
                        [No anonymity direction made]
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                                Nour Ramadan
                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Not represented
For the appellant:     Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Nour Ramadan, date of birth  16.6.87,  is  a  citizen  of
    Syria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Chambers,  who  allowed  the  claimant's
    appeal against the decision of the respondent, dated 10.7.13, to refuse
    the claimant's application for leave to remain in the  UK  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard the appeal on 5.2.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Fisher  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    6.3.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 15.10.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. I found an error of law and  set  the  decision  aside,  reserving  the
    making of the decision to myself in the Upper Tribunal.

 6. It came back before me on 17.12.14. However, Mr Harrison confirmed that
    following my error of law decision, the Secretary of State had  granted
    leave to remain to the appellant. In  the  circumstances,  the  refusal
    decision which is the subject of the  appeal  has  been  withdrawn  and
    there is no appeal to be decided.



Conclusion & Decision:

 7. There is no extant appeal before the Upper Tribunal

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.








Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There is no extant appeal.
