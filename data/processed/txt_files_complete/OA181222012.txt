                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   This is an appeal  brought  against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal dated 26 June 2013.  That decision  rejected  the  appellant's
    appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State dated  23  August
    2012.  The Secretary  of  State's  decision  rejected  the  appellant's
    application for entry clearance to  the  United  Kingdom  to  join  his
    spouse with a view to settlement.

2.   The basic facts can be briefly summarised.  The appellant  was  granted
    a visa as a visitor for 30 March 2004 valid for six  months.   However,
    the appellant overstayed the limits in the  visa.   On  an  undisclosed
    date the appellant sought to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  at  his  own
    expense and voluntarily.  He was encountered at London Heathrow Airport
    by the United Kingdom  Borders  Agency  and  was  issued  with  a  form
    notifying him that he was a person liable to detention and removal from
    the United Kingdom.

3.   The decision of the Secretary of State refused the application  upon  a
    number of bases.  First, that the submission made by the appellant that
    he was leaving to return to Bangladesh to  regularise  his  status  was
    doubted.  Secondly, that his submission that he intended  to  marry  in
    the United Kingdom was also doubted.  Thirdly, the Secretary  of  State
    further doubted that the spouse he said he was to marry in  the  United
    Kingdom had continuous employment of a genuine nature.  Fourthly,  that
    the alleged spouse was in receipt of public funds of �189.12  per  week
    and that the appellant's addition  would  place  a  further  burden  on
    public funds.  As to this the Secretary of State was not satisfied that
    the appellant could be maintained by the spouse as  a  sponsor  without
    further recourse to public funds.  Fifthly, that the submission made by
    the applicant that he  had  been  offered  employment  was  lacking  in
    evidential support  and  was  not  treated  as  genuine.   Sixthly  and
    finally, the decision rejected the appellant's Article 8  private  life
    claim.

4.   The appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was  dismissed.   The
    Tribunal stated at the outset of the determination that it had heard no
    oral evidence from the sponsor who  had  been  present  throughout  the
    hearing.  An interpreter had been requested for the  hearing  but  none
    was available at the time the appeal was called on but the  appellant's
    solicitor had indicated that he would not be calling  the  sponsor  and
    was content to proceed upon the basis of submissions only  and  without
    an interpreter.

5.   The Tribunal set out the background in some  detail  at  paragraphs  12
    and 13 and then proceeded  to  make  specific  findings  which  may  be
    summarised as follows.  First, that the appellant  and  his  wife  were
    properly married in a genuine relationship.  Secondly, that the  effect
    of the appellant living with his spouse  would  have  consequences  for
    rent and council tax and the appellant had not shown that this increase
    in costs could be met.  Thirdly, that the alleged job offer made to the
    appellant was not genuine.  In these circumstances the judge found that
    on what he described as the twin bases of maintenance and accommodation
    the requirements in the Immigration Rules were not satisfied.

6.   The appellant appeals with leave of the Upper Tribunal  on  essentially
    three points as set out  in  the  grounds  of  appeal  which  we  would
    summarise  as  follows.   First,  the  judge  erred  in  ignoring   the
    appellant's job offer and in failing to take  judicial  notice  of  the
    fact that the United Kingdom catering and food manufacturing sector had
    a sustained and acute labour shortage and that even if  the  job  offer
    were ignored the appellant could obtain work.  It  was  also  submitted
    that the judge erred in concluding that the job offer was not  genuine.
    Secondly, the grounds submit that the judge erred in  failing  to  find
    that the income of the sponsor and that of the appellant when  combined
    failed to meet the maintenance requirements in the Rules.  Thirdly, the
    judge erred in paragraph 22  in  failing  to  find  that  accommodation
    requirements were met given that the sponsor was a secure tenant of the
    London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

7.   We turn now to consider the merits of these  grounds.   We  start  with
    the question of the job offer which we  can  deal  with  briefly.   The
    judge set out fully his reasons why he rejected the genuineness of  the
    offer at paragraphs 18 to 21.  We consider that this  fact-finding  was
    within his margin of discretion to find facts.  We do not  accept  that
    the judge was bound to have regard to the general circumstances of  the
    market in the absence of evidence about that and the specific skills of
    the appellant and how or why he could find work in that  wider  market.
    He had to deal with the evidence before him.  He did not err.

8.   We turn to the second issue concerning income.  Two points arise  here.
     First, concerning savings and secondly  concerning  rent  and  council
    tax.  As to savings the sponsor put evidence to the Tribunal  that  she
    had savings in excess of �7,000 and  that  this  was  relevant  to  her
    ability  to  maintain  the  appellant.   At   paragraph   17   of   the
    determination the Judge stated as follows:

         "I have also noted that the Tower Hamlets calculations submitted by
         the sponsor indicate total assessed capital �0.   The  sponsor  now
         says she has savings in excess of �7,000.  She  does  not  indicate
         that these were obtained after the council's assessment was made or
         if her level of savings were such that they  fell  properly  to  be
         disregarded or, if they should have been taken into  account,  what
         their effect on the calculation Mr Kalam provided would have been."

    The reference to the calculation provided by Mr Kalam is to a  schedule
    set out in paragraph 15 of the determination which identifies  relevant
    income and expenditure.  On the income side of  the  calculation  is  a
    reference to savings in a  sum  of  �5,647.59  divided  by  104  weekly
    payments amounting to a  weekly  figure  of  �54.30.   In  essence  the
    Tribunal  considered  that  the  statement   of   savings   alone   was
    insufficient and that other evidence and proof was required  to  enable
    it to be taken into account.  We can detect no error in his  conclusion
    which was, at base one, of the sufficiency of evidence.  He was  simply
    unsatisfied that this was a sufficiently secure figure to be taken into
    account in the light of the evidence before him.  That is  why  at  the
    end of paragraph 17 he states that he was uncertain what the effect  of
    that figure would have been on Mr Kalam's calculation had it in  effect
    been taken out of account.

9.   The second matter concerns rent  and  council  tax.   As  to  this  the
    Tribunal stated in paragraph 16 as follows:

         "In his submission Mr Lowton pointed out that  the  effect  of  the
         appellant residing with the sponsor  on  the  amount  of  rent  and
         council tax which would then be payable has  not  been  taken  into
         account in Mr Kalam's calculation.  I accept that submission as the
         statement of reason which is at page 35 of the  appellant's  bundle
         shows the calculation made by Tower Hamlets Council is based  on  a
         'lone parent 18 to pension age'.  The appellant has not shown  that
         the amount of rent and council tax payable would remain the same if
         he lived with the sponsor or that if those sums were increased  the
         family's expenditure would be such that the maintenance requirement
         would still be met."

10.  We do not accept that in arriving at  this  particular  conclusion  the
    judge in any way erred.  There is no dispute that if the appellant were
    to join his spouse that rent and council tax might  increase.   In  the
    final  account  the  Tribunal  was  not  satisfied  that   with   these
    uncertainties the sponsor would be able to maintain the appellant.

11.  We turn now to consider the alternative issue of accommodation.  As  to
    this the first point to note is that the Secretary of State's  decision
    is based upon maintenance only and  not  accommodation.   We  read  the
    reference to accommodation in the Tribunal's judgment at  paragraph  22
    as referring to the council tax and rent issue  that  we  have  already
    referred to.  It is not therefore a separate point which  needs  to  be
    addressed.

12.  Finally, although the matter is raised only indirectly in  the  grounds
    of appeal we will address the question of Article 8.  Again, as to this
    we can detect no error in the judge's assessment.   The  judge  applied
    the correct test and took account of all relevant matters including the
    period of time in which the appellant was present in the United Kingdom
    without authorisation and the fact that  he  had  not  lost  ties  with
    Bangladesh.

13.  Finally, the Tribunal concluded that the  appellant  entered  into  the
    spousal relationship in full knowledge that  he  had  no  right  to  be
    present in the United Kingdom and she took account of  the  absence  of
    evidence establishing that the wife and stepson could not join  him  in
    Bangladesh.  These were findings which she was entitled to make and  we
    can detect no error in them  and  for  these  reasons  this  appeal  is
    dismissed.
