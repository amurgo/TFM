                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

This decision is reported solely for the  approach  to  the  facts  of  such
cases suggested at �� 27-28.

   This is a case where the Immigration Appeal Tribunal allowed  an  appeal
   from  a  decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Mr  JDL  Edwards),  sitting  at
   Manchester on 2 April 2004, dismissing an asylum and human rights appeal
   by a citizen of Iran,  and  directed  a  fresh  hearing  before  another
   adjudicator. Under the transitional provisions of the 2004 Act (see 2005
   No. 65 (C.25) article 5.1a and 5.2), the case proceeds as if it  were  a
   reconsideration following review by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal:
   since the Immigration Appeal Tribunal  directed  a  fresh  hearing,  the
   parties agreed that we should deal with the case as if we  were  sitting
   to hear the appeal for the first time.

2. The appellant is a homosexual: though  he  never  had  any  face-to-face
   confrontation with the Iranian authorities over that, he  says  he  fled
   when he realized a member of his c�terie  had  been  arrested  by  them,
   apparently leaving  an  incriminating  video  in  their  hands,  showing
   unseemly activity on the part of this appellant  and  others.  His  case
   before us  was  based  partly  on  the  consequences  of  that  history,
   including the issue of summonses against him since he left, if accepted;
   and, if not, on what was said to be the real risk on return  of  Refugee
   Convention persecution or  article  3  ill-treatment,  if  the  relevant
   international law did not require him to express  his  predilections  in
   the relatively discreet way he had so far adopted in public. There is no
   issue as to the appellant's homosexual life-style in Iran; but there are
   serious live issues over the existence of the video and the  genuineness
   of the summonses.The appellant had enjoyed two homosexual liaisons while
   in this country; but by the date of the hearing before us both had  come
   to an end, so no article 8 point was argued on any private life he might
   have had of that kind.

3. The appellant's history appears in his statement of evidence form [SEF],
   interview, and a further statement, all of which he adopted as  part  of
   his evidence in chief. Briefly, he was born in Teheran in 1976, and  had
   first engaged in buggery with a contemporary  called  Dawood  when  both
   were only 14: later a school-mate of theirs  called  Mohsin  had  become
   involved too in their activities, which took place  in  Mohsin's  house,
   where no-one else was usually present. One occasion with Dawood  at  the
   appellant's family home did become known to his brother, and so  to  his
   parents; but they did not take it seriously.

4. In 1992, when the appellant was 16, he went  as  a  trainee  to  a  shoe
   factory, and lost touch with Dawood and Mohsin, but then established.  a
   liaison with another young man called Abbas. Some time  after  finishing
   military service, when he was 21, the appellant met  two  others,  Arash
   and Hussein.  The  four  of  them  started  going  to  "Park  Daneshjoo"
   (literally, 'Student Park', though the appellant said it  did  not  form
   part of any campus) which he described as "a park for gays to meet  in":
   it is referred to in the background evidence, to which we  shall  return
   in due course. There they met two  others  of  like  mind,  Behnood  and
   Hamid.

5. Arash was later arrested and not seen again, apparently because of  what
   the authorities considered the outrageous way he dressed. This led to  a
   temporary decline in the outdoor meetings  of  the  others,  though  the
   appellant and Abbas continued to engage  in  buggery  with  each  other.
   Eventually the meetings in the park, going on to  the  cinema,  resumed,
   and the appellant began to indulge in the same practice with  the  other
   three, without Abbas being aware of it. There is no suggestion that  any
   buggery took place, other than in private.

6. The five of them used to have private parties  every  fortnight:  on  15
   April 2001, one was to be held at Hussein's house. The appellant however
   had to take his mother to see her doctor, so  rang  Hussein  to  say  he
   could not come. When Hussein insisted, the appellant became  suspicious,
   and took his mother to stay with his sister for the night. Next day  his
   brother rang to say the security forces had been to their  family  house
   looking for him: the appellant realized, according  to  him,  that  they
   must have been at Hussein's when he was pressing  him  to  come  to  the
   party.

7. The appellant had no idea, as he confirmed before us, how the police got
   to know what sort of party they were having; but he knew, he said,  that
   his life was in danger, and he must leave the  country,  which  he  did,
   first going to a cousin at Karaj, who arranged the services of an agent,
   through whom he crossed the Turkish border and claimed asylum on 18  May
   2001, saying he had got here by road (presumably in the back of a lorry)
   that same day.

8. The appellant's case was that the video which  must  (he  assumed)  have
   fallen into the hands of the police when  they  raided  Hussein's  house
   showed the five of them kissing  on  trips  they  had  made  to  various
   places. There was only one cassette, though  it  had  been  recorded  at
   various times on various cameras: they had made it to remind  themselves
   of happier times when for some reason they were unable to meet. In  view
   of the different customs on such matters in the Middle  East,  we  asked
   the appellant whether he and his friends were  exchanging  the  kind  of
   kiss normal between men who know each other well in  that  part  of  the
   world: he said no, they were kissing on the lips. The video  would  also
   have exposed them  to  suspicion  as  they  were  discussing  sex-change
   operations.

9. The appellant had got permission to appeal from the original adjudicator
   decision by means of the summonses, which he had produced for the  first
   time with his grounds of appeal: how that amounted to an arguable  error
   of law on the part of the adjudicator is more than we can say,  but  not
   something we are required to explain.  (The  Tribunal  had  allowed  the
   appeal and directed a fresh hearing on the basis  that  the  adjudicator
   had not made any finding as to whether the video was in the hands of the
   authorities: again this was a little odd, as clearly he had not accepted
   the existence of such a video at all, but again we are not called on  to
   give any explanation for that).

10. The hearing before the adjudicator took place on  2  April  2004,  at  a
   time when the appellant had been in this country for  just  under  three
   years. This is what the adjudicator recorded, at � 17:

   ...he had heard from his family that the authorities  had  been  looking
   for him  and  correspondence  had  been  received  there  demanding  his
   attendance at a police station. He did not have these documents.

   In the appellant's original grounds of appeal to the  Tribunal,  it  was
   said at � 3:

   The Appellant has mentioned the summons throughout his claim but was  in
   the process of obtaining them. Unfortunately he  did  not  receive  them
   until after his Appeal Hearing. The Summon was faxed  across  from  Iran
   and have been translated.

   While translated  "papers  of  summon"  and  "letter  from  the  Iranian
   authorities" were attached to the grounds of  appeal,  this  history  is
   not, as it happens, true: there is nothing about any  summonses  in  the
   appellant's SEF statement (A9-10), filed by his previous  solicitors  on
   18 December 2001, just seven months after he arrived and claimed  asylum
   in this country. At his  interview  on  22  March  2002,  where  he  was
   accompanied by a representative who intervened as and when she  saw  fit
   (see B9), there is no mention of them either. The appellant's notice  of
   appeal to the adjudicator, filed by his present solicitors on 27 January
   2004, equally says nothing about any summonses.


11. Nevertheless the appellant was  granted  permission  to  appeal  to  the
   Tribunal on the basis of the summonses; and they said  at  �  5,  (after
   allowing the appeal and directing a fresh hearing  on  the  point  about
   whether the video was in the hands of the authorities):

   In addition to the above,  the  Adjudicator  accepted  that  there  were
   certain summonses issued  by  the  authorities  against  the  appellant,
   however these summonses were not available to the Adjudicator.

   Regrettably, this is not quite accurate either: what the adjudicator had
   actually said, at � 24e, was this:

   I note that the summons that the appellant says was sent to his  address
   has not been produced to me.  The  appellant  seemed  to  me  to  be  an
   intelligent individual, who has been  properly  advised  throughout  his
   claim. He would realise the importance of such  items,  and  I  find  it
   surprising that he took no steps to produce it.

   It is clear from the adjudicator's general negative credibility findings
   at � 25-26 that he did not accept  that  any  summons  had  been  issued
   against the appellant.

12. Before us, the appellant produced the originals of the  documents  which
   are attached to his solicitors' letter of 11 July 2005, and we  numbered
   them in order of production. The appellant also produced  two  envelopes
   (exhibits 2 and 3), one stamped and post-marked in Persian, but  without
   anything we were able to read to show the date it was  sent:  the  other
   had no post-marks at all, but was said to have been sent inside a larger
   envelope through a courier service. He was not able to say what had come
   in each of the envelopes: one at least had  also  contained  a  personal
   letter. Exhibit 1, which he said had been sent him  by  his  family,  is
   headed,  in  translation  "Administration  of  justice  of  the  Islamic
   Republic  of  Iran:  Paper  of  summon":  it  is  dated,  Persian-style,
   "1380/2/4" [agreed Gregorian  equivalent  24  April  2001]  directs  the
   appellant's appearance 15 days later [ie 9 May] at the "Judicial complex
   of Hashemi, section  1117",  the  "Subject  of  incrimination:  Unlawful
   relations". The original is completed in handwriting on  an  A5  printed
   form, showing the usual crescent and scales motif.

13. The appellant went on to say that he had asked his family  to  send  the
   originals of exhibits 4 and 5 after the adjudicator hearing  as  he  had
   not been able to produce them then. Exhibit 4 is a handwritten  document
   on A5 paper with a printed crescent heading,  completed  with  the  date
   (agreed equivalent 17 April 2001), requiring the appellant to report  to
   police station no. 115 the next day for "explanation regarding the above
   offence", which had been stated at the top as "Immodest acts". Exhibit 4
   is on a similar form to exhibit 1, headed "Administration of justice  of
   the Islamic Republic of Iran: Warrant of Arrest", and is  dated  (agreed
   equivalent) 2 May 2001; but it does not direct the appellant's immediate
   arrest, instead requiring his appearance at the same "judicial  complex"
   seven days later (ie 9 May). It alleges his "... failure  to  attend  on
   the last occasion", and announces an intention to arrest  the  appellant
   if he does not do so this time.

14. In cross-examination the appellant maintained that these  documents  had
   indeed been sent to his family after his departure. In closing, Mr  Wood
   suggested that, on the background evidence, the one headed  "Warrant  of
   Arrest" would not have been supplied to them. However we pointed out  to
   him that, while the point  of  an  immediate  warrant  would  have  been
   defeated by handing it over to the suspect's family,  the  operation  of
   this one was apparently suspended, pending his appearance or  not  on  9
   May; so that it might reasonably have been handed over to  secure  that,
   and Mr Wood realistically withdrew this argument. Mr Brown for his  part
   frankly acknowledged that the timing of production of the summonses  did
   go against their authenticity; but he argued that  this  should  not  be
   held against the appellant on the more crucial question of  whether  the
   authorities had seized a video showing him as he claimed. We shall  come
   to that point when we have reached our conclusions on  the  authenticity
   of all these documents, after reviewing the rest of the evidence.

15. Background   Mr Brown did not refer us to  any  background  evidence  as
   such, relying instead  on  the  extensive  review  of  it  in  RM  &  BB
   (Homosexuals)  Iran  CG  [2005]  UKIAT  00117.  The  Tribunal's  primary
   conclusions, at � 123, were as follows:

   We consider that we can properly conclude from the evidence that  it  is
   most unlikely, given the statistics and the problems of proof, that  the
   death penalty for sodomy  is  anything  other  than  an  extremely  rare
   occurrence. It is clear however that, and here we are in agreement  with
   paragraph 24 of Ms Rogers summary  of  the  evidence,  those  guilty  of
   immoral acts under Article 147/115 and Tafkhiz under  Article  121  face
   harsh punishments which can include long  prison  sentences  up  to  six
   years and up to one hundred lashes.  We  remind  ourselves  of  what  Mr
   Kovats accepted on behalf of the Secretary of State that a  sentence  of
   lashing would be such as to give rise to a breach of Article  3  rights.
   Although we agree with Mr  Kovats  that  the  interest  of  the  Iranian
   authorities in homosexual offenders  is  essentially  focused  upon  any
   outrage to public decency, it is in our view clear that the  authorities
   would not simply ignore, as Mr Kovats suggested they  might  in  certain
   situations, reports made to them of persons carrying out homosexual acts
   albeit in private. If a complaint is brought to the authorities then  we
   are satisfied that they would act upon that  to  the  extent  that  they
   would arrest the claimed offenders  and  question  them  and  thereafter
   there is a real  risk  that  either  on  the  basis  of  confessions  or
   knowledge of the judge which might arise from such matters  as  previous
   history or medical evidence or the evidence of the person who claimed to
   have observed the homosexual acts,  that  they  would  be  subjected  to
   significant prison sentences and/or lashing.

16. We are prepared to assume, for present  purposes,  that,  if  the  video
   existed and was in the hands of the authorities, then, though  it  could
   certainly  not  lead  to  any  death  sentence  for  sodomy,  it   might
   conceivably lead to a lashing for lesser  immoral  acts,  which  on  the
   European jurisprudence would amount to "inhuman or degrading  treatment"
   contrary to article 3 of the Human Rights Convention. There  is  nothing
   in the summons procedure they are said to have adopted to indicate  that
   a capital charge was even contemplated, though again  a  conviction  for
   "unlawful relations" or "immodest acts" between men may  be  assumed  to
   merit a lashing under Iranian law.

17. Mr Wood referred us to � 6.179 of the  April  2005  CIPU  report,  which
   cites a report of a seminar held in Berlin in 2001 to the effect that

   There are special parks in Tehran, known as homosexual  meeting  places.
   There are also a large number of transvestites walking around  in  North
   Tehran. Furthermore, sex changes are permitted in  Iran  and  operations
   are frequently and openly carried out. A  different  sexual  orientation
   may, however, create problems. Still, homosexuality is  practised  every
   day, and as long as people do not intend to proselytise 'transvestim' or
   homosexuality, they will most likely remain unharmed.

18. This has to be read in the light of the evidence of a  "country  expert"
   called Anna Enayat, set out in RM & BB at � 28:

   It was clear that there were practising homosexuals in Iran and  it  was
   "well known" that homosexual men made contact with one another in  parks
   in Tehran,  the  Dameshjoo  Park  being  the  location  most  frequently
   mentioned in the literature, but it  could  not  be  inferred  from  the
   existence of such meeting places and  the  fact  that  undoubtedly  many
   homosexuals managed to avoid prosecution that  a  practicing  homosexual
   does not face risks. Nor did she consider that it could be inferred that
   there was anything resembling a publicly accepted "gay scene"  in  Iran.
   Homosexuals did not congregate in an overt  fashion.  Urban  parks  were
   patrolled by members of the Basij and other morality police units,  some
   in plain clothes. Homosexuals who avoid showing  overt  signs  of  their
   sexual orientation in public can for the most part avoid being  targeted
   by the controls. Enforcement of the law is inconsistent on the  part  of
   the Iranian authorities.

19. The Tribunal in RM & BB did  not  express  any  specific  view  on  that
   evidence, perhaps because of their � 124:

   Given that we consider therefore that there is a real risk that a person
   who comes to the authorities' attention  for  having  committed  an  act
   falling within the relevant provisions of the code, it must follow  that
   since this can be presumed to be known by those engaging in  such  acts,
   such actions would be likely to be carried out carefully.  We  have  not
   been addressed on the issue of discretion and whether people engaging in
   such acts can be expected to act discreetly, which was considered by the
   Australian High Court recently, in Appellant S395/2002  v  Minister  for
   Immigration [2003] HCA 71. That is another argument for another day  and
   we would not wish this determination to be  interpreted  as  imposing  a
   requirement of discretion, but rather a recognition that  in  the  legal
   context in which homosexuals operate in Iran it  can  be  expected  that
   they would be likely to conduct themselves discreetly for  fear  of  the
   obvious repercussions that would follow.

20.  Findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  on  history     In  view  of  the
   background evidence about  public  displays  of  homosexuality,  we  are
   prepared to accept that the appellant and his friends might have  kissed
   each other on the lips while on outings; but we have no doubt that  they
   would have done so with some discretion. There is nothing to support the
   appellant's own evidence as to the police raid on Hussein's and presumed
   discovery of the video, except for the summonses (by which we  mean  all
   the police and court documents produced). While so far as we know  there
   is nothing intrinsic on the face of any of these to show  they  are  not
   genuine, the timing of their production raises a serious question  about
   that. Each of them is directed to the appellant in April  or  May  2001,
   and the presumption, in the absence of any  evidence  to  the  contrary,
   must be that they were sent to or served at his family home during those
   months.

21.  The  appellant  claimed  asylum  on  18  May  2001,  and  was   already
   represented by London solicitors when his SEF was filed on  18  December
   that year. Either they or  his  present  firm  represented  him  at  his
   interview on 22 March 2002: that may have been his  present  solicitors,
   from Burnley, as the interview took place in Liverpool, and it was  they
   who filed notice of appeal to the adjudicator  for  him  on  27  January
   2004. Yet there was no mention of any summonses till he appeared  before
   the adjudicator on 2 April that year, and no production of even  a  copy
   of them (at first  apparently  faxed  ones)  till  his  application  for
   permission to appeal from the decision which  followed.  We  agree  with
   what  the  adjudicator  said  (see  11)  about  this   appellant   being
   intelligent and well advised, and we cannot accept  that,  if  summonses
   had genuinely reached his family home in April or May 2001,  they  would
   not have made any appearance in his asylum claim till nearly three years
   had passed.

22. We fully recognize that someone who has a genuine  fear  of  persecution
   may  sometimes  resort  to  lies,  or  even  the  concoction  of   false
   documentary evidence, to support a case about  which  he  is  less  than
   optimistic. However, bearing that note of caution in mind,  we  have  to
   consider the evidence about the video in the light of what we have found
   to be the appellant's serious falsehood on the  summonses.  As  we  have
   already made clear, we take the view that any lip-kissing would probably
   have been performed fairly discreetly in the first place: would it  have
   been recorded by video as claimed?

23. The appellant's case is that it was so recorded as  a  memento  for  the
   members of his group when they were unable to see each other. We can see
   no reason why they should have chosen for that purpose  to  record  acts
   which the appellant claims (and we are prepared to  accept)  would  have
   exposed them to "inhuman or degrading treatment" if they fell  into  the
   hands of the authorities. We cannot claim any  particular  knowledge  of
   the ways of homosexuals, still less of Iranian homosexuals; but  we  are
   entitled to use what we know of human  nature,  so  far  as  it  appears
   common to mankind in general.

24. Couples in general habitually derive considerable comfort,  when  apart,
   from photographs of each other, and would no doubt  do  so  from  videos
   too; of course  groups  of  more  than  two  also  exist,  where  sexual
   activities are engaged in together.  In  the  absence  of  a  degree  of
   voyeurism, which has not been suggested in this case, however, we do not
   see why mementos should need to take the form  of  the  protagonists  or
   others kissing, rather than  the  kind  of  holiday  or  other  portrait
   pictures so well known to most people. That is especially so where  such
   mementos should be as risky as these are said to  have  turned  out.  We
   cannot see why those concerned should have wished to remember each other
   discussing sex-change operations, when there had been nothing said about
   any of them contemplating such drastic measures. We take the  view  that
   this element was brought in simply to make the effect of the video  more
   explicit, though it seems from the CIPU report (see 17) that  there  was
   no risk attached to such operations in themselves.

25. We do not think much of Mr Brown's point that the appellant  could  have
   invented an even more explicit video if he had chosen.  Refraining  from
   an outrageous lie  in  favour  of  a  moderate  one  is  rarely  a  real
   recommendation  for  truthfulness.  Bearing  in  mind  the   appellant's
   willingness to use what we have found to be concocted  evidence  in  the
   form of the summonses, we have no doubt  that  his  evidence  about  the
   video was also made up to explain what it was that put him at risk  with
   the authorities, when  he  had  refused  the  invitation  to  Hussein's,
   allowing him to escape any direct confrontation with them.

26. We do not accept the appellant's evidence on either  the  video  or  the
   summonses, and we see nothing in the rest of his history to put  him  at
   any real risk on return. For the avoidance of doubt, we  do  not  accept
   that there was a raid on Hussein's at all, in view of what the appellant
   found it necessary to claim about the video; but, if there was, it would
   have disclosed no evidence likely to put the appellant at  risk  without
   the video, without which there was nothing to support  whatever  Hussain
   might have said about him: see RM & BB at � 122 for the Tribunal's  view
   that there is "an impressive level of care"  within  the  Iranian  legal
   system, at least so far as the formalities are concerned.

27. Generic risk We have chosen this name to indicate Mr Brown's  subsidiary
   argument, relying on the point left open by the Tribunal in RM & BB at �
   124 (see 18), and taken up before them by the New Zealand Refugee Status
   Appeals  Authority [RSAA] in Refugee Appeal No. 74655/03,  to  which  he
   also referred us. The RSAA held that homosexuals, in Iran there as here,
   could not be required to conduct themselves with discretion: the crucial
   passage is perhaps at � 114:

   By requiring the refugee applicant to abandon a core right  the  refugee
   decision-maker is requiring of  the  refugee  the  same  submissive  and
   compliant behaviour, which the agent of persecution in  the  country  of
   origin seeks to achieve by persecutory conduct.

28. Whether there is or is not a "core right"  for  persons  of  any  sexual
   orientation to conduct themselves with discretion in their public sexual
   practices is not something we need in our view decide, though we  should
   have thought that such discretion was part of the ordinary consensus  of
   civilized mankind (and still more so of a  number  of  races  considered
   "uncivilized", so far as they still exist).  The  reason  is  that  this
   appellant on our findings of fact, and his own expressed intentions  for
   the future, has never shown the slightest wish to engage  in  homosexual
   conduct in any way in the face of the public or the authorities, such as
   might expose him to any real risk, on the background evidence, on return
   to Iran. Whether he has or does not have a "core right"  to  go  in  for
   that sort of thing, his return will not expose him either to  Convention
   persecution or ill-treatment.
