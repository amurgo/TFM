For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Murphy, Counsel


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of State.  However,
    it is convenient to continue to refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 30 December 2003 as a  visitor.   He
    was granted subsequent periods of leave until on 8 July 2013 his  leave
    was curtailed, to expire on 3 November 2013.

 3. On 30 October 2013 he made a further application for  leave  to  remain
    which was withdrawn on 22 March 2015.   On  4  December  2013  he  made
    another application for leave to remain, outside the Immigration Rules,
    but that application was rejected in a decision on 7 March 2014.  Then,
    on 27 March 2014, the appellant  made  the  application  for  leave  to
    remain on the grounds of long residence  with  reference  to  paragraph
    276B of the Rules.  That application was rejected in the decision dated
    3 September 2015 and which is the subject matter of this appeal.

 4. The appellant's appeal to the First-tier Tribunal was heard  by  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Flynn ("the FtJ") on 23  January  2017.   Following
    that hearing she allowed the appeal.

 5. The respondent had refused the application for leave to remain  on  the
    grounds of long residence on the basis that she was not satisfied  that
    the appellant met the requirements of para  276B(ii)  (public  interest
    considerations) because she was satisfied that  there  was  significant
    evidence to conclude that an English language  test  certificate  which
    the appellant used in an application for leave to remain on 29 February
    2012 was  fraudulently  obtained.   The  respondent  also  refused  the
    application    with     reference     to     para     322(2)     (false
    representations/failure to disclose any material fact  in  relation  to
    obtaining leave).

 6. The respondent's grounds of appeal in relation to the decision  of  the
    FtJ criticises the FtJ's conclusion that the methodology of  assessment
    of the English language  tests  at  the  particular  college,  Westlink
    College, was open to doubt.  It is argued that the FtJ applied too high
    a standard of proof (presumably the reference to "burden of  proof"  in
    the grounds is a mistake).  It is argued that the appellant's  evidence
    did not address the fact that no  tests  from  that  college  could  be
    verified as having been  genuinely  obtained  and  the  result  of  the
    appellant's test was regarded as "questionable" in the analysis.  It is
    argued that on the balance of probabilities the  appellant's  test  was
    carried out by a proxy test taker.

 7. It is accepted in the respondent's grounds that  the  ETS  verification
    system is not infallible, but it is argued that it is adequately robust
    and rigorous.  Furthermore, given that the appellant's English language
    certificate was withdrawn, and the validity of the information provided
    in relation to the English language test was no longer vouched  for  by
    ETS, that was sufficient for the respondent to refuse the application.

 8. The submissions on behalf of the respondent  before  me  were  to  like
    effect.  I was referred to the respondent's bundle that was before  the
    FtJ, which included the 'look-up' tool' in relation to the  appellant's
    test.  The appellant's test was stated as being "invalid".  There  were
    witness statements from Rebecca Collings  and  Peter  Millington  which
    explained the term 'questionable'.  The evidence was that  in  relation
    to Westlink College 87% of the tests were found to be invalid and  only
    13% questionable.

 9. The FtJ had not referred to the evidence of Professor French,  also  in
    the respondent's supplementary bundle, to the effect that the chance of
    a false positive result (of invalidity) was less than  1%.   There  was
    both human and digital assessment.

10. It  was  submitted  that  the  FtJ  had  misunderstood  what  the  term
    'questionable' meant, and that materially undermined her conclusions.

11. Having heard submissions on behalf of the respondent, I did not feel it
    necessary to hear any  submissions  on  behalf  of  the  appellant.   I
    announced at the end of the hearing that I was not satisfied that there
    was any error of law in the  decision  of  the  FtJ.   I  now  give  my
    reasons.

12. At [15] the FtJ commenced her summary of the appellant's oral evidence.
     She referred to the appellant giving evidence before her  in  English,
    and submitting his original  certificates  which  were  examined.   She
    referred to tests he had taken after the questioned  test  in  December
    2011.

13. She recorded that the appellant was cross-examined in detail about  his
    taking of the test in 2011, with  many  specific  and  precise  details
    being recorded.  He gave evidence about times, how he  got  there,  and
    answered detailed questions in cross-examination about the  details  of
    the test.  There were some matters that he was unable to remember.

14. The person who is said to have given the appellant a lift in his car to
    the test centre, his friend/cousin, also gave  evidence.   He  was  not
    cross-examined.

15. The FtJ summarised the submissions made on behalf  of  the  respondent,
    those submissions including reference  to  the  witness  statements  of
    Rebecca  Collings,  Peter  Millington  and  Professor  French.    Those
    submissions also referred to the Project Fa�ade report relied on by the
    respondent.

16. The FtJ in her conclusions set out the legal framework within which her
    decision needed to be made, and referred to relevant authority.

17. At [39] she referred to the  respondent  having  produced  the  witness
    statements of Ms Collings and Mr Millington, as  well  as  the  Project
    Fa�ade report, which she described as a criminal enquiry into abuse  of
    the TOEIC for Westlink College in Essex.  She stated  that  the  report
    indicated that between 18 October 2011  and  18  April  2012,  Westlink
    College administered 815 TOEIC speaking and writing tests, of which 661
    (72%) were invalid.  She referred to the look-up tool  in  relation  to
    the appellant's test, found to be invalid.

18. In the light of that evidence she concluded  that  the  respondent  had
    discharged the evidential burden of establishing dishonesty on the part
    of the appellant.

19. At [43] she stated that she had listened carefully to the  evidence  of
    the appellant, and she found him to be a credible witness, as  was  the
    witness called on his behalf.  She stated that he had provided evidence
    of his studies in the UK, including  a  level  6  advanced  diploma  in
    business management, which he completed around three months  before  he
    took the TOEIC examination.

20. In the next paragraph she said that she considered it significant  that
    the appellant had successfully undertaken studies in the UK for  almost
    eight years before the TOEIC examination in December 2011.

21. At [45] she said that she accepted the submissions  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent to the effect that the appellant's  evidence  was  vague  in
    many respects.  She stated however, that she  could  not  overlook  the
    lapse of more than five years since the test  was  taken.   She  stated
    that she agreed with the submissions made on behalf of  the  appellant,
    namely that  it  was  "entirely  clear"  that  the  appellant  had  not
    rehearsed what took place on the day of  the  examination.   She  added
    that in fact it appeared that he had not thought about that day  for  a
    considerable time.

22. She stated that in line with the  decision  in  SM  and  Qadir  (ETS  -
    Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 (IAC), she attached  little
    weight to the fact that  the  Appellant  had  difficulty  in  recalling
    precisely what took place during the  test  or  even  what  results  he
    achieved.   She  disagreed  with  the  contention  on  behalf  of   the
    respondent that the appellant's forgetfulness meant that he was  not  a
    credible witness.

23. She also found merit in the submission on behalf of  the  appellant  in
    relation to the appellant having taken  subsequent  tests,  albeit  two
    years after the TOEIC test, and reached level 3 after only  one  week's
    additional study.  She said that she  considered  that  those  were  an
    indication that he could communicate well in English.

24. At [48], reminding herself of the guidance given by the Upper  Tribunal
    in  other  cases,  she  said  that  the  appellant   had   no   trouble
    understanding any of the questions put to him and did not need to  have
    any of them repeated or rephrased.  More significantly, she  said  that
    there was nothing to suggest that he had any  difficulty  with  English
    during his studies before the TOEIC test.

25. It is really the next paragraph in particular that the respondent takes
    issue with.  There the FtJ said that it was clear  that  a  significant
    minority of results from Westlink College (including more than a  dozen
    on the same date that the appellant took his test) were not invalidated
    but were treated as "questionable".  She stated  that  she  found  that
    this result "raises doubts about the methodology employed, particularly
    as the only evidence specific to the appellant is the extract from  the
    computer record".

26. In the following  paragraph  however,  she  said  that  she  could  not
    overlook the fact that the Project Fa�ade report states that  an  audit
    was conducted on 15 May 2012, following which the tests carried out  on
    that date were invalidated, but it appeared that Westlink  College  was
    not suspended until 2014.  The appellant had  submitted  evidence  that
    the college was being monitored by the review  team,  but  it  did  not
    appear that the  respondent  notified  anyone  who  had  provided  test
    results undertaken at the College or required  them  to  undertake  new
    tests.  She agreed with the submissions on behalf of the appellant that
    that delay made it more difficult for the appellant to provide evidence
    that he had not used any deception.

27. Finally, on the question of deception, at [51] she concluded  that  the
    appellant had provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate on a  balance
    of probabilities that he did not use deception,  nor  provide  a  false
    document  with  his  2012  application.   Thus,  she  found  that   the
    respondent  was  not  justified  in  refusing  the  application   under
    paragraph 322.

28. The definition of "questionable" as explained at [29] of  Ms  Collings'
    statement, where she refers to Mr Millington's statement, is  where  an
    individual's test result was still  cancelled  on  the  basis  of  test
    administration irregularity, including the fact that the test was taken
    at  a  UK  testing  centre  when  numerous  other  results   had   been
    invalidated, and by which point  ETS  had  analysed  over  10,000  test
    scores, of which the majority were cancelled as invalid, the  remainder
    being cancelled as questionable.

29. It is evident from the FtJ's decision that she was fully aware  of  the
    evidence provided on  behalf  of  the  respondent  in  support  of  the
    contention that the appellant's test was  obtained  fraudulently.   She
    specifically referred to that evidence and some aspects of it.  It  is,
    however, apparent that she was  impressed  by  the  evidence  that  the
    appellant gave in relation to the test that he says he took and she had
    the opportunity of making an assessment of the appellant as a  witness,
    as well as the evidence of his supporting witness.  It is apparent that
    the appellant's evidence made a significant impression on the FtJ.

30. It is true that the FtJ could have referred to  other  aspects  of  the
    evidence provided by the respondent in relation to the testing process,
    for example the report of Professor French.  However, in order for  the
    respondent to make good the complaint in the grounds  about  the  FtJ's
    assessment of the evidence, it would have to be demonstrated  that  the
    FtJ failed to appreciate the import of the evidence, or failed to  take
    it into account.  I  cannot  see  that  this  is  demonstrated  in  the
    circumstances of this case.

31. It may be that the FtJ ought to have explained why she  concluded  that
    the treatment of some of the  test  results  as  "questionable"  raised
    doubt about the methodology of the testing process.   However,  and  in
    any event, that was but  one  part  of  the  FtJ's  assessment  of  the
    evidence.  Furthermore, I do not see in the FtJ's decision any sense in
    which that aspect of her conclusions was decisive or  of  more  potency
    than other aspects of the evidence which she considered.

32. Even  if  I  was  to  conclude  that  the  FtJ  was  in  error  in  her
    understanding of the process of investigation in relation to the  tests
    at Westlink College, I would not have concluded  that  that  error  was
    such as to amount to an error of law in her overall assessment.

33. I am satisfied that the FtJ's conclusion that  the  appellant  had  not
    used deception in the test taken in 2011 was a conclusion that was open
    to her on the evidence.

34. It was accepted on behalf of the respondent  before  me  that  if  that
    matter was lawfully resolved in favour of the appellant, no other issue
    arose in terms of the appellant's ability to meet the  requirements  of
    para 276B of the Rules.   As  Mr  Jarvis  fairly  pointed  out  at  the
    hearing, not only was  no  other  matter  raised  in  the  respondent's
    decision, the only other possible question arises in relation  to  para
    276B(iv) (life and language in the UK), but the appellant's evidence in
    his witness statement is to the effect that he  had  taken  and  passed
    that test, with details having been provided. Furthermore, I note  that
    at page 37 of the appellant's  bundle  there  is  confirmation  of  the
    appellant having taken and passed the relevant test.

35. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any error of law
    in the decision of the FtJ and her decision to allow  the  appeal  must
    stand.

36. By way of postscript, I note that the FtJ said  that  the  respondent's
    decision was not in accordance with the law and that  she  allowed  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.  However, it was not  open  to  the
    FtJ to conclude that the decision was not in accordance with  the  law,
    or to allow the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules,  under  the  new
    appeals regime.  However, that is an error of form, not of substance.

    Decision

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  Its decision to allow the appeal therefore
    stands.
