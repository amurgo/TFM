For the Secretary of State:      Mr T Lindsay on 20th September and Mr E
Tufan on 10th December, Senior Home Office Presenting Officers

For SM: Ms C H Bexson instructed by AJA solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008
(SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless  the  Upper  Tribunal  or  a
Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any  form  of
publication thereof shall directly or indirectly identify the  appellant  in
this determination identified as SB  or  his  son  identified  as  BB.  This
direction applies to, amongst others, all parties.  Any  failure  to  comply
with this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings.

The Secretary of State was both appellant and respondent,  as  was  SB.  See
below for chronology.

         1. On 9th January 2016 SB's human rights claim for leave to remain
            in the UK was refused by the SSHD. His appeal  was  allowed  by
            First-tier Tribunal judge Clarke  for  reasons  set  out  in  a
            decision promulgated on 22nd February 2017. That  decision  was
            set aside by the Upper Tribunal and remitted to the  First-tier
            Tribunal for a fresh decision to be taken. First-tier  Tribunal
            Cohen heard the appeal and allowed the appeal for  reasons  set
            out in a decision promulgated on  26th  April  2018.  The  SSHD
            sought and was granted permission to appeal on the grounds that
            it was arguable the First-tier Tribunal  judge  had  failed  to
            have adequate regard to the dicta in Su [2017] EWCA Civ 1069.


         2. SB was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment for drugs offences  on
            15th February 1996. He was deported on 16th July 1997.  He  re-
            entered the UK in breach of  the  deportation  order  in  March
            1998. That date is unsubstantiated.


         3. First-tier Tribunal judge Cohen stated ([16]) that  he  had  to
            have particular regard to Su and he  found  that  SB  could  no
            longer be classified as a persistent  offender.  Although  that
            finding is not challenged, the judge has failed to engage  with
            paragraph 399D of the Immigration Rules which, as confirmed  in
            Su expressly deals with those who enter the UK in breach  of  a
            deportation order. The stringent requirements of that paragraph
            of the Rules have not been complied with;  the  judge  has  not
            considered whether very exceptional circumstances exist and has
            failed to consider s117B(4) of the Nationality Immigration  and
            Asylum Act 2002.


         4. I set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal judge Cohen for
            material error of law. The resumed hearing took place before me
            on 10th December 2018. AJA solicitors filed a small  bundle  of
            documents on behalf  of  SB,  the  content  of  which  was  not
            challenged. I heard no oral  evidence,  it  being  agreed  that
            because  of  the  retained  findings  and  the  recently  filed
            documentary evidence  there  was  no  requirement  for  further
            evidence. I heard submissions from both representatives.

         5. Su involved a  foreign  criminal  who  had  been  deported  but
            returned to the UK in breach of the deportation order.  At  the
            time of his conviction he had leave to remain in the  UK  as  a
            spouse;  he  was  sentenced  to  42  months  imprisonment   and
            recommended  for  deportation.  He  was  eventually,  after  an
            unsuccessful statutory appeal, deported in October 1998. He re-
            entered the UK in 2000. His marriage was dissolved  in  January
            2002 and he subsequently married a  woman  who  had  originally
            come from Pakistan  and  then  become  a  British  Citizen.  He
            applied for leave to remain as a spouse in  June  200423;  that
            application was eventually considered by  the  SSHD  who  first
            considered whether to revoke the  deportation  order  that  had
            been made in 1998. The SSHD decided not  to  revoke  the  order
            (February 2014) and it was the  appeal  against  that  decision
            that was before the Court of Appeal,  his  appeal  having  been
            successful before the First-tier Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
            Tribunal decision being upheld by the Upper Tribunal. The Court
            of Appeal referred explicitly to paragraph 399D:

             Where a foreign criminal has  been  deported  and  enters  the
             United Kingdom in breach of a deportation  order,  enforcement
             of the deportation order is in the public interest and will be
             implemented unless there are very exceptional circumstances.


         6. The Court of Appeal held that paragraph 399D  encapsulated  the
            public interest in ensuring that a deportation order was  fully
            effective. The First-tier Tribunal and the Upper  Tribunal  had
            considered paragraph 391 (revocation  of  a  deportation  order
            after deportation)  which  provided  that  for  those  deported
            having been sentenced to less  than  four  years  imprisonment,
            continuation of a deportation order would be the proper  course
            unless 10 years have elapsed since the making of the order. The
            Court of Appeal  held  that  paragraph  399D  made  clear  that
            paragraph 391 did not apply  if  a  person  returned  illegally
            during the 10 years.


         7.  The  appeals  landscape  has  changed   somewhat   since   the
            respondent's decision in Su. In the instant case, the appeal is
            against the refusal of the human rights  claim.  But  paragraph
            399D remains the operative paragraph in the Immigration  Rules.
            Considering  "very  exceptional  circumstances"  the  Court  of
            Appeal said

                  In  considering  whether  there   are   very   exceptional
                  circumstances as required by para.399D, it is necessary to
                  know the weight  to  be  attached  to  each  side  of  the
                  balance. It was essential  to  appreciate  and  apply  the
                  statutory requirement to  apply  "little  weight"  to  the
                  respondent's  private  and  family  life  developed  while
                  unlawfully present in the UK.


         8. The Court of Appeal in Su also considered the  issue  of  delay
            and refers to Mr Yeo's submissions:


                       where the SSHD delays deportation for many years,  it
                  lessens the weight of some reasons  for  the  high  public
                  interest in the deportation of foreign criminals. The risk
                  of re-offending had been much reduced  during  the  delay.
                  The deterrent effect on offending was weakened  if  prompt
                  action to deport is not taken. The expression of society's
                  revulsion at the offender's criminal conduct  is  blunted.
                  These observations are of course well made, but they  were
                  not made in the context of a person who had unlawfully re-
                  entered the country in breach of a deportation  order  and
                  they clearly do not obviate the  need  for  the  decision-
                  making tribunal to apply the relevant provisions and legal
                  principles.


         9. First-tier Tribunal judge Cohen found:


                . SB has a genuine and subsisting relationship with his wife
                  and children (son and stepson);
                . He has not offended  since  1996  and  can  no  longer  be
                  considered to be a persistent offender;
                . He is at low risk of  re-offending  and  at  low  risk  of
                  causing serious harm in the future;
                . He has shown remorse;
                . He has significant responsibility for his son  BB  who  is
                  challenging.
                . He has  assisted  BB  through  his  schooling,  frequently
                  attending meetings with  the  head  and  teachers  of  his
                  school;
                .  His  wife,  despite  health   problems,   is   the   sole
                  breadwinner;
                . He and his wife have a long term relationship;
                . Relocation of his wife and children to  Jamaica  would  be
                  disastrous;  their  happiness   and   school   performance
                  deteriorated when he was in Jamaica and there has  been  a
                  dramatic improvement in their psychological  and  physical
                  wellbeing after his release from detention.


        10. These  findings  were  not  challenged  by  the  SSHD  and  are
            retained. It is necessary to  consider  the  circumstances  and
            immigration and criminal history of SB and his family  in  more
            depth.


        11. SB arrive in the UK on 27th June 1994 as a visitor. He and  his
            wife[1] married and on 16th December 1994 he applied for  leave
            to remain as a spouse.  That  application  was  refused  on  11
            October 1996 and he was  served  with  a  decision  to  make  a
            deportation order against  him  following  his  conviction  for
            drugs offences and a sentence  of  3  years  imprisonment.  His
            appeal against that decision was dismissed on 4 June 1997 and a
            deportation order was signed on 25th June 1997; he was deported
            to Jamaica on 16th July 1997. His wife  and  their  oldest  son
            (born July 1995) followed the next day.  They  remained  living
            with him in Jamaica for 2-6 months (It was unclear how long she
            was there, but it seems to have been  roughly  that  amount  of
            time) and then returned to the UK. SB returned illegally to the
            UK on an unconfirmed date but said by him  to  be  March  1998.
            There was no corroborating documentary  evidence  that  he  had
            arrived then. In 2001 SB  was  fined  �100  for  possession  of
            cannabis.

        12. On 17th June 2004 he made an application for leave to remain as
            a spouse. A second son, BB, was born in  September  2004.  That
            application by SB was treated by the SSHD as an application  to
            revoke  the  deportation  order  in  addition   to   being   an
            application for leave to remain.  The  SSHD  refused  both  for
            reasons set out in a letter dated 3rd April 2008.  Between  the
            making of that  application  and  the  SSHD  decision,  SB  was
            convicted of possession of a bladed weapon in  2006  and  fined
            �300. SB appealed the SSHD's decision. His appeal was dismissed
            by the First-tier Tribunal in a decision  promulgated  on  10th
            June 2008.

        13. He did not leave the UK; the SSHD does not appear to have taken
            any steps to remove him.

        14. On 27th October 2015 he applied for leave to  remain  on  human
            rights grounds - family and private life. That application  was
            refused on 9th January 2016. his appeal against  that  decision
            was allowed on 22nd February 2017 by First-tier Tribunal  judge
            Clarke. That decision was set aside  by  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
            Kebede on 20th November 2017 and  remitted  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal. First-tier Tribunal Judge Cohen allowed the appeal on
            26th April 2018. The SSHD was granted permission to appeal  and
            I found a material error of law and set aside the decision.

        15. The youngest son, BB, has behavioural problems. Included in the
            bundle of documents before me are various letters and  reports.
            BB has been excluded from  primary  and  secondary  school.  In
            October 2015 Family Solutions Key worker said that she had been
            liaising with BB's school because the school had grave concerns
            that his behaviour was "spiralling out of control" and  he  was
            in danger of being permanently excluded from school. She writes
            of the intention of both the  appellant  SB  and  his  wife  to
            attend a parenting programme. She writes:

            ...if SB were to be removed from his family the  outcome  would
            be devastating for the family but especially for BB  who  is  a
            young child who has emotional and challenging needs. SB plays a
            pivotal role in his children's life, especially in  BB's  life.
            SB  takes  and  collects  BB  from  school,  he   attends   all
            professional meeting with the school,  Social  Services,  Child
            and  Adolescent  Mental  Health  Services  "CAMHS"  as   stated
            previously SB is a "main Carer for the children".


        16. A letter dated 2nd February 2017 from Family  Solutions  states
            that due to the positive interventions which  took  place  with
            professionals and family, the case was closed with them on 17th
            March 2016. There continue to be concerns about BB's behaviour.
            A letter from the school  dated  17  October  2018  details  an
            exclusion for 2 days in October 2018 and that this has been the
            second exclusion since he joined the school. The school  refers
            to  BB  having  received   internal   seclusions,   alternative
            provision at Right Track, being on a behaviour Support plan and
            on report to his Learning Advisor  and  Year  Team  Leader  and
            having a mentor to  help  support  his  needs.  There  were  no
            reports from any of these individuals.  There is  reference  in
            that letter to a reintegration meeting scheduled to take  place
            on 29th October 2018 but the letter from the Year  Team  Leader
            dated 9th November 2018 makes no mention of this. Nor  does  it
            make any mention of what he has been doing with BB. He confirms
            that SB has been an active parent and has a positive impact  on
            BB's learning. This is difficult to reconcile with  the  letter
            written  less  than  a  month  earlier  which  refers  to   the
            involvement of the Team Leader with BB at the school.


        17. An undated letter, although written  after  1st  February  2018
            given the content, from  the  Commanding  Officer  of  the  406
            Willesden RAF Air Cadets is of more assistance in that it  says
            that since BB became involved with the cadets, he  has  "turned
            his behaviour round significantly", "that there are still  some
            discipline issues",  he  is  "taking  more  responsibility  for
            himself" and that BB "responds better in  his  behaviour"  when
            his father is involved.


        18. There is some reference in the papers to SB's wife having had a
            suspected stroke. There is no medical evidence to support this,
            but on the basis that this did occur there was no  evidence  of
            any long-term health problems. SB's wife continues to work full
            time.

        19. There  is  also  reference  to  their  older  son  having  been
            identified as requiring special needs assistance at school  and
            that  this  was  only  obtained  after  lengthy  argument   and
            intervention by both parents and that SB played  a  significant
            role in this achievement.  Again,  there  is  no  corroborative
            evidence  of  this  or  whether  that  young  person  has   any
            continuing difficulties. That son is an adult, but I have taken
            at its highest the suggestion that he  has  special  needs  and
            continues to need support from his parents.

        20. The difficulty with the evidence before me is that  nowhere  is
            there  any  clear  exposition  of  exactly  what  problems  and
            behavioural difficulties BB has. It seems that over  the  years
            there may have been CAMHS and social services involvement, that
            there  are  detailed  school  records  of   the   interventions
            undertaken by the school and there  has  been  some  one-to-one
            involvement  of  mentors/teachers.  In  the  absence  of   this
            detailed information it is simply not possible for me to  reach
            a conclusion as to the effect on BB of  the  departure  of  his
            father. That it will have an effect is evident - the  departure
            of a father is bound to have an effect, particularly where  the
            father has been closely involved with his son as appears to  be
            the case here.  But  for  that  departure  to  amount  to  very
            exceptional circumstances  needs  more  than  just  an  adverse
            effect is required.  There is no significant evidence before me
            what the effect would be on BB if he and  his  mother  were  to
            move to Jamaica with the appellant. I  acknowledge  that  there
            were some difficulties some 10  years  or  so  ago,  but  those
            difficulties are not very specific, may not be apparent now and
            in any event staying for only 2 to 6 months  does  not  seem  a
            very long period within which to determine whether a  move  was
            the correct process or not. There is a lack of significant  and
            detailed evidence of the effect on BB  of  separation,  of  the
            effect on SB's wife on her employment and ability  to  continue
            to deal with one, possibly two vulnerable people in her  family
            in the absence of SB the appellant and a lack of evidence  from
            individuals with whom the family have a  close  connections  of
            what they would do, or not do, if SB was deported.


        21. I note that SB has been  before  the  criminal  courts  on  two
            occasions since his unlawful entry to the UK after deportation.
            I also note that an earlier appeal was dismissed, and he became
            appeal rights exhausted in June 2008 yet the SSHD  did  nothing
            to remove him despite knowing  where  he  lived.  I  note  that
            paragraph 399D states that a  person  "will"  be  removed.  The
            failure on the part of  the  SSHD  to  remove  SB  indicates  a
            diminution in the public interest in  deporting  him,  but  the
            fact remains that taking that factor into account together with
            the lack  of  evidence  before  me  of  the  necessity  of  the
            relationship with BB and  the  consequences  of  its  fracture,
            there are inadequate compelling circumstances to find  in  SB's
            favour.

        22. On the evidence before me I am not  satisfied  that  there  are
            very compelling circumstances. SB does not meet paragraph  399D
            of the Immigration Rules.

        23. I have considered ss117B and C of the  Nationality  Immigration
            and Asylum Act 2002. Although the First-tier Tribunal has found
            that SB is not a persistent offender, such a finding has little
            bearing, now, on the questions  to  be  considered  namely  the
            proportionality of the decision  to  refuse  his  human  rights
            claim.  The  factors  in  ss117B  and  C  are  factors  to   be
            considered; they are not the only matters in contention.  He is
            a foreign criminal and although it may  not  be  reasonable  to
            expect BB and/or his mother to leave the UK (and  the  evidence
            upon which to make such a finding is sadly lacking) there is no
            particular up  to  date  evidence  as  to  the  possibility  of
            significant  obstacles  to  reintegration  to  Jamaica  and  no
            particular evidence that the effect of SB's  deportation  would
            be unduly harsh on BB.

        24. SB was in the UK lawfully during his visit visa and during  the
            time his application for leave to remain as a spouse was  being
            considered. He was never given leave to remain as a spouse. His
            application for leave to remain as a spouse was made whilst  he
            was lawfully in the UK and there is no doubt but that it  is  a
            genuine and subsisting relationship. Although it cannot be said
            that the relationship was entered  into  when  his  immigration
            status was unlawful, and it is to the couple's benefit that  it
            continued after his deportation, upon his return to the  UK  it
            continued whilst his status was unlawful. His  extended  family
            and private life has strengthened during that lengthy period of
            unlawful residence and little  weight  can  be  given  to  that
            development. It may well be  different  if  there  were  strong
            evidence as  to  why  the  couple  had  allowed  that  unlawful
            residence to continue, particularly after he lost his appeal in
            2008, but there is no such relevant evidence before me.

        25. Taking all these matters  into  account,  I  dismiss  SB's  the
            appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Secretary   of   State
            respondent to refuse the human rights claim.



                  Conclusions:

                  I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The
             findings of fact are retained.
             I dismiss the  appeal  by  SB  against  the  decision  of  the
             Secretary of State  respondent  to  refuse  the  human  rights
             claim.
