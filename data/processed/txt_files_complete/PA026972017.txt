NOTICE OF DECISION 

	Both subparagraphs of rule 40(3) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698 as amended) apply to this decision.

	The decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge I D Boyes) sent out on 7 July 2018 is erroneous in law.  I set it aside.

	The appeal is remitted to be determined by the First-tier Tribunal de novo at an oral hearing by a judge other than Judge I D Boyes. 



Signed



	A Grubb

	Judge of the Upper Tribunal
