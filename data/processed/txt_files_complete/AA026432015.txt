                          DETERMINATION and REASONS

 1. First-tier Tribunal Judge Bradshaw  dismissed  the  appellant's  asylum
    appeal by determination promulgated on 6 May 2015.

 2. The appellant appealed to the Upper Tribunal on the following grounds:

    "...

    Ground 1 - Danian Point

    2.     The FTT erred in law when rejecting the appellant's claim  based
    on her membership of the Xin Min party:

         (i)      the FTT erred in law at paragraphs 82-83 when finding that
         it did not accept the appellant would continue her  membership  and
         activities in China and found that the appellant had said  this  in
         order to improve her chance of success in her  asylum  claim.   The
         FTT has erred in law by failing to have regard  to YB  v  Secretary
         of State for the Home Department  [2008] EWCA  Civ  360  (see  also
         Danian v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2000]  Imm  AR
         96) which held that  activities  other  than  bona  fide  political
         protect could create refugee status.   The  FTT  erred  in  law  by
         failing to take account or  assess  the  case  on  the  basis  that
         although it might be unpalatable that the  appellant  might  become
         entitled to refugee status as a result of her cynical manipulation,
         if objective she had a well-founded fear of persecution  by  reason
         of political opinion, that might be a reality  (see  YB,  supra  as
         approved in KS (Burma) and NL (Burma) v Secretary of State for  the
         Home Department [2013] Imm AR 525 at paragraphs  32-33).   The  FTT
         erred in law by failing to recognise that there is no principle  as
         relied on that a claimant is not entitled  to  asylum  if  she  has
         manufactured her claim by reason of her activities  in  the  UK  or
         indeed  would  carry   on   with   those   activities   in   China.
         Opportunistic activity is not an automatic bar to asylum.   Whether
         a claimant's consequent fear of  persecution  or  ill-treatment  is
         well-founded is an objective question.  The purpose  is  to  assess
         whether such activities would expose the claimant to persecution or
         serious harm if returned.  That suggests that the  initial  inquiry
         is whether the authorities in the country of origin are  likely  to
         observe and record  the  claimant's  activity  and  it  appears  to
         countenance a possible finding that the authorities  would  realise
         that the activity was opportunistic and insincere.  In  that  event
         the  fear  of  consequent  ill-treatment  might   be   ill-founded.
         However, the appellant does have a well-founded fear as  the  party
         is proscribed and standing the country information as  to  how  the
         Chinese  authorities  view  political  dissent,  the  FTT  was  not
         entitled to say that the appellant did not have a well-founded fear
         of persecution.  The FTT had objective evidence  that  the  Chinese
         government suppressed political opponents.  It  therefore  required
         little or no evidence to arrive at a strong  possibility  that  the
         government monitored oppositionist groups and had  informers.   The
         FTT was not entitled to say that the appellant did not have a well-
         founded fear of persecution.

    Ground 2 - Flawed Credibility Finding

    3.     It is submitted  that  the  FTT  erred  by  arriving  at  flawed
    credibility findings when assessing the appellant's claim based on  her
    membership of the Xin Min party:

         (i)       notwithstanding  the  foregoing  ground,  the   appellant
         maintains that the FTT has erred in law in disbelieving  her.   The
         FTT finds at paragraphs 60-88 that the appellant's contention  that
         she would go out to introduce the public to the party in  the  hope
         that people would join  them  was  inconsistent  with  the  country
         information which showed that communication  among  members  is  by
         email and blog.  However, the FTT has erred in law as there  is  no
         true inconsistency as  the  country  information  only  related  to
         communication between members and not how persons were recruited to
         the party.  The FTT has thus  erred  in  law  by  relying  on  this
         purported  inconsistency  when   in   fact   there   is   no   true
         inconsistency.  In other  words,  the  FTT  erred  in  law  as  the
         evidence did not support the finding of the FTT;

         (ii)       the   FTT    erred    in    law    by    falling    into
         speculation/conjecture at paragraph  66.   The  FTT  embarks  on  a
         number of  assumptions  on  which  there  was  no  or  insufficient
         evidence to base those assumptions.  Indeed the FTT accepts that it
         had no information as to whether the appellant had  a  computer  or
         access to same;

         (iii)    the FTT erred in law by failing to act in a fair manner at
         paragraph 66.  If the FTT had any such concerns it  ought  to  have
         clarified those with the appellant.  The appellant has been  denied
         an opportunity to  respond  to  the  FTT's  queries  on  which  the
         findings at paragraph 66 are based;

         (iv)     the FTT erred in law at paragraph 67  by  relying  on  the
         fact that the appellant has not provided any  evidence  to  support
         the contention that party members were involved  in  activities  in
         the street.  However the FTT has erred as there is no  onus  on  an
         asylum seeker to corroborate her claim;

         (v)      the FTT erred in law at paragraph 75 by  placing  reliance
         on the fact that the  appellant  did  not  have  a  high  political
         profile in China.  However, the FTT has fallen into error as  there
         is no evidence to show that it is only high  profile  members  that
         are at risk, when the FTT notes that the organisation is proscribed
         by the Chinese authorities (see paragraph 61 of the FTT's decision)
         and which would indicate that any member is at risk;

         (vi)     the FTT erred in law when finding that  as  the  appellant
         has not been involved with the party for a period of 6 years within
         the UK.  In stating the reasons why the appellant was not involved,
         the FTT has not taken into account or failed to assess  or  explain
         how it has assessed the appellant's explanation that she could  not
         find anything about the party in Glasgow.   It  is  unrealistic  to
         maintain that the appellant could involve herself  in  the  party's
         activities  in  London  when  she  was  an  asylum   seeker   being
         accommodated in Glasgow  through  NSS  with  limited  finances  and
         limited access to finding out about the party;

         (vii)    in light of  the  foregoing,  the  FTT  erred  in  law  is
         disbelieving the appellant's political claim and that the remaining
         errors are not sufficient to allow the rejection of the appellant's
         political asylum claim to stand."

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson granted permission to appeal  to  the
    UT by decision dated 27 August 2015,  adding  this  (slightly  cryptic)
    observation:

         "As to AX (family planning scheme) China CG  [2012],  there  is  no
         need to ignore evidence from an expert as to matters that post-date
         the promulgation of that case."

 4. In a Rule 24 response dated 15 September 2015 the respondent  says  the
    judge gave adequate reasons for finding that the appellant  was  not  a
    member of the Xin Min party; that the judge noted at paragraphs 80  and
    81 that the appellant had not participated in any political  activities
    in the UK since 2009; and that the judge  was  entitled  to  find  that
    there was little evidence to show that the appellant might be  at  risk
    on return to China.

 5. In light of the observation by  the  permission  judge,  the  appellant
    under cover of a letter dated 24 September  2015  sought  to  amend  by
    adding a third ground of appeal:

         ... the FtT [failed] to exercise anxious scrutiny  in  relation  to
         the expert report which post-dated country guidance and  /  or  was
         not considered in AX .. specifically looking at  the  situation  in
         Fujian suggesting that the appellant  would  be  at  real  risk  of
         sterilisation or forcible  insertion  of  an  IUD  (�29-37  of  the
         report) that internal flight would  be  unreasonable  (�57-65)  and
         that ... it would not be in the best interests of the  children  to
         be returned (�38 onwards).

 6. Having heard the submissions for the appellant on 7  December  2015,  I
    allowed the amendment.  Mr  Matthews  unfortunately  had  not  received
    intimation of the proposed third ground.  Mr Winter  accepted  that  it
    would be reasonable to give time to reply.  There was also  a  lack  of
    time to complete all cases before the UT on the day.

 7. I indicated that I was not persuaded by the first ground of appeal.  It
    makes a great deal of the correct approach to a sur  place  claim,  but
    glosses over  the  fact  that  the  appellant  described  only  minimal
    involvement in the UK with the party to which  he  claimed  allegiance.
    The ground also fails to identify  any  passage  in  the  determination
    which misstates or misapplies the law about activities conducted in bad
    faith to enhance a claim.  Beyond that, the hearing was  adjourned  for
    further submissions to be made.

 8. These are the written submissions for the respondent:

    "...

      2. In light of the fact that the Upper Tribunal found that  they  were
         not persuaded by the  appellant's  first  ground  of  appeal,  this
         response to the appellant's oral submissions does not dwell on  the
         substance of that  ground.   The  ground  ignores  the  finding  at
         paragraph 82 that the appellant wasn't to be believed when she said
         that she was still studying materials about her  party  whilst  she
         was in the UK [and] the finding at paragraph 83 that the  appellant
         gave evidence that "she would continue to participate in activities
         of the party in China and that she was still studying material  for
         the party at the moment because she thought that it was appropriate
         to answer in this way as it would improve her chances of success in
         her asylum claim."  The FtT went on to give  detailed  reasons  for
         that finding ...

      3. Standing the Upper Tribunal's rejection  of  the  first  ground  of
         appeal, the appellant's second ground of appeal becomes irrelevant.
          That is because the appellant's own claim, even if it is taken  at
         face value, is that she had limited involvement with  the  CNDP  in
         China for a limited time there.  There was no evidence  before  the
         FtT that the Chinese government had found out about her involvement
         despite the appellant's best efforts to say that she was likely  to
         be on a list - see paragraphs 71 and 84 of the FtT's determination.
          The FtT's finding at paragraph 75 that  she  had  not  established
         that she would be of interest to the authorities if she returned to
         China on the basis of her membership of the party,  in  conjunction
         with the findings at paragraph 82 and 83 regarding whether she  has
         retained any interest in politics, effectively determine the appeal
         on the basis of political opinion against her.  This is, after all,
         an appellant who presents no evidence  that  the  authorities  were
         aware of her claimed activities in China before she left,  nor  any
         evidence that they have subsequently become aware.  As such  it  is
         difficult to see where any risk to her might arise from.

    ...

    5.     Taking the points in the sub-paragraphs of ground 2 in turn:

         (i)      Firstly, it is important to note that the  FtT  considered
             this issue in the round taking into account all of their other
             findings.  They include their finding at paragraph 59 that the
             appellant had not given a satisfactory explanation to her lack
             of knowledge over a fundamental matter, at paragraph  67  they
             noted there was a contradiction between what her  team  leader
             was said to have told her to do and her actual activities  and
             finally that she was not believed  in  paragraphs  82  and  83
             about her  claimed  activities  in  the  UK  or  her  intended
             political activities in China.

             Secondly, the operative part of the  FtT's  decision  on  this
             point  is  in  paragraph  66.   That  contains   an   entirely
             intelligible and reasonable assessment of  the  evidence  with
             appropriate and lawful inferences being drawn.   The  FtT  are
             not saying that  the  evidence  showed  that  the  recruitment
             process happened only on line.  What they are saying  is  that
             it was reasonable to conclude, in the circumstances, that  she
             would have been aware that the main means of communication was
             on line and that as a member of the party, it  was  reasonable
             to conclude  that  she  would  have  had  some  resource  made
             available to her  to  allow  her  to  communicate  with  other
             members in that way, if she was as interested in the party  as
             claimed.  That finding involves a lawful  inference  from  the
             evidence as a whole and a finding on the  appellant's  general
             credibility ie if she really was as interested in the party as
             she claimed  then  she  would  have  communicated  with  other
             members on line.  That was a finding open to the FtT.

         ii)     Submissions on this point are made above ...

        iii) There was no requirement to seek clarification.  The issue was
             the subject of evidence  in  both  cross-examination  and  re-
             examination.  The drawing of an inference from  that  evidence
             does not require the  possible  inference  to  be  put  to  an
             appellant and no authority is  cited  in  support  of  such  a
             proposition.

         iv) Noting what the evidence says or does not say is not an  error
             of law.  In any event the operative part of that paragraph  is
             the lawful reference to the contradiction in  the  appellant's
             evidence referred to in (i) above.

          v)     Firstly, there was no evidence which the appellant pointed
             to  which  established  that  someone  who   had   a   distant
             involvement, at a low level, with the CNDP was at risk.  There
             was no evidence that the Chinese government knew of  her  past
             involvement.  There was no accepted evidence that she would be
             involved again with that organisation if we returned to China.
              Taking that into account the finding at  paragraph  75,  made
             after  considering  the  evidence  in  the  round,  that   the
             appellant hadn't established any basis to say that she was  at
             risk in China was unassailable.

             Secondly, the fact that the organisation was proscribed wasn't
             of itself capable of being evidence which  was  supportive  of
             low level, historic, members being at risk.  There  are  after
             all 10 million people said to  support  that  organisation  in
             China.

         (vi)     This point is simply a disagreement.  There is no basis to
             say that the FtT failed  to  take  into  account  the  matters
             referred to in this sub-paragraph  of  ground  2.   Given  the
             other difficulties in her evidence the FtT were well  entitled
             to be unimpressed by her evidence on this point.

      6. The new ground 3  is  that  the  FtT  failed  to  exercise  anxious
         scrutiny in relation to an expert report which post dated AX  China
         CG [2012]  UKUT  000097  (IAC)  or  was  not  considered  in  AX...
         specifically looking at the situation in Fujian suggesting that the
         appellant would be  at  real  risk  of  sterilisation  or  forcible
         insertion of an IUD, that internal flight would not  be  reasonable
         and that it would not be in the best interests of the  children  to
         be returned.

      7. ... There is also no substance to this ground of appeal.   ...  The
         FtT had regard  to  the  report  of  Ms  Gordon  and  gave  careful
         consideration to it - paragraph 86.  In paragraph  89  of  the  FtT
         indicated that they took into account what was said in Ms  Gordon's
         report but, essentially they preferred  the  guidance  in  AX.   As
         such, anxious scrutiny was given to the expert report.

      8. Ms Gordon's report does not deal with the position of children born
         outside of China, or more specifically  in  this  instance,  Fujian
         province.  At paragraph 19  she  appears  to  assume  that  as  the
         children were born out of wedlock the  appellant  and  her  partner
         would be liable to a fine of  4  to  6  times  the  average  annual
         disposable income of urban residents (the  appellant  is  an  urban
         resident).  The fine would probably be higher given that  a  second
         child has been born of the relationship.

      9. The Upper Tribunal in AX did deal with the issue  of  foreign  born
         children.  They gave general guidance at paras 186-190.  They noted
         and accepted Professor Fu's evidence  regarding  the  existence  of
         statutory protection against  destitution  at  paragraph  186.   At
         paragraph  187  they  noted  the  attitude  taken   by   provincial
         authorities  to  parents  returning  to  China  with   foreign-born
         children is unclear.  Some indicated that they would be  considered
         authorised whilst others said that they would not and the  children
         would only be registered on payment of a fine.  The level of a SUC,
         even if it is imposed, is not likely to be beyond the  means  of  a
         couple who have lived abroad for years.  There was little  evidence
         of parents being disproportionately penalised when they return with
         foreign born children - paragraph 188.  Their ultimate  conclusion,
         which is entirely apposite to this case given the  claim  that  the
         appellant as an unmarried mother who was not entitled to  have  any
         children, is that foreign couples who have children over  and  over
         the permitted number are not at real risk of persecution or serious
         harm - paragraph 189.  Moreover, as the  Upper  Tribunal  noted  in
         paragraph 173 family planning officials are  required  to  register
         children born outside of the regulations once a SUC has been  paid.



     10. In any event, the FtT specifically  agreed  with  the  respondent's
         reasons for refusing the claim on the grounds of family planning  -
         paragraph 90.  Paragraph 34 of the decision letter referred to  the
         assisted voluntary return scheme in place at the date  of  decision
         which allowed for financial payments of  up  to  �2000  per  family
         member.  The amount of fine  which  the  appellant  might  face  is
         unknown.  However, in paragraph 203 of AX the Upper Tribunal  held,
         in the context of Hunan, that the fine of 6 to 8 times  the  income
         multiplier for that province would be between �2940 and �3920.   On
         the assumption that the fine would be around that level it would be
         within the appellant's means to pay that if she took  the  assisted
         voluntary return package - a finding endorsed by the FtT here.   As
         in AX there is no basis here to suggest that the children would not
         be registered because a fine could not be paid - see also paragraph
         204 of AX.

     11.  Otherwise  the  report  of  Ms  Gordon  is  said  to  support  the
         proposition that there is  a  risk  that  the  appellant  would  be
         subjected to forcible sterilisation or the forcible insertion of an
         IUD.  Nothing in Ms Gordon's report on this issue would  justify  a
         departure from what the Upper Tribunal found in AX on  this  issue.
         Some of what is said by her on this issue seems to  be  unsupported
         general assertions - see paragraphs 34 and 37.   Reference  to  the
         decision of the US Court of Appeals  for  the  Seventh  Circuit  to
         support her assertions is entirely misplaced. That decision  was  a
         decision to remit the appeal to the decision maker to consider  the
         evidence again and is not any authority  for  the  guidance  in  AX
         being wrong - see DL [2014] CSOH 147.  Some of the expert  evidence
         before the Upper Tribunal in AX was that a mother of 4 children was
         overwhelmingly likely to be forced into sterilisation  -  paragraph
         92.  It was clearly a live issue.  However, the Upper Tribunal,  on
         the extensive evidence available to them were  not  satisfied  that
         there was in general a real risk of sterilisation aside  from  when
         there are  'crackdowns'  -  paragraph  185.   The  evidence  in  Ms
         Gordon's report falls very far  short  of  providing  a  principled
         basis for  departing  from  that  clear  conclusion  reached  after
         considering extensive evidence.

     12. As such, given that the findings of the FtT  are  essentially  that
         any fine which might be levied could be paid (given that they refer
         to the decision letter and adopt what it says) and that  there  was
         no evidence in Ms Gordon's report which would allow them to  depart
         from AX in  relation  to  forcible  sterilisation,  they  have  not
         committed the error of law which the appellant now  complains  they
         have.  To the contrary, they have reached a decision on this  issue
         which was clearly lawful with reference to AX and the report of  Ms
         Gordon.  In addition there is no basis to  say  that  the  children
         would not be registered on the payment  of  a  SUC.   Consequently,
         internal relocation does not arise and there is  no  basis  to  say
         that the best interests of the children would be harmed on  account
         of the family planning regulations.

     13. Should those submissions not be  accepted  the  respondent  submits
         that the appeal should still not be allowed on remaking.   That  is
         because there have been further relaxations of the family  planning
         regulations  so  as  to  permit  couples  to  have  2  children   -
         http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-34665539.  The  appeal  should
         either be remade and dismissed  or  a  further  hearing  should  be
         convened  in  order  to  consider  the  relevance  of  the  further
         relaxation of the scheme."

 9. These are the final written submissions for the appellant:

      1. The appellant would not seek to expand on Ground 1 as amplified  in
         oral submissions at the last  hearing.   In  any  event  the  Upper
         Tribunal has found that in its view Ground 1 has no merit.

    Ground 2

      2. In response to paragraph 3 of the respondent's submissions:

          i) ... the respondent's submissions go too far in suggesting that
             due to the rejection of the first ground of appeal,  Ground  2
             becomes irrelevant.  Ground 2 is a stand alone ground and  has
             no connection to the first ground;

         ii) although the respondent cites paragraphs  71  and  74  of  the
             FtT's decision, the appellant's position was that she  was  at
             risk as other members had been arrested and she was  told  not
             to return (see paragraph 24 of the FtT's decision);

        iii) The respondent cites paragraphs 75 of the FtT's submission but
             that is subject to challenge in the grounds.;

         iv) the respondent  cites  paragraphs  82  and  83  of  the  FtT's
             submission but those findings are undermined  if  the  grounds
             are made out and in particular whether  the grounds  undermine
             the findings that the appellant is not at real risk;

          v) it is correct to say  that  the  appellant  has  presented  no
             evidence that  the  authorities  were  aware  of  her  claimed
             activities in China before she left nor any evidence that they
             have subsequently become aware.  The appellant  presented  her
             own oral and written evidence to confirm that the  authorities
             have become  aware  of  her  involvement.   It  must  also  be
             remembered that an asylum seeker is not under an obligation to
             corroborate her claim.

      3. In response to paragraph 5  of  the  respondent's  submissions  and
         dealing seriatim with the respondent's sub-paragraphs:

          i) ... the  error  at  Ground  2(1)  is  well-founded.   Although
             paragraph 59 of the FtT's decision is not challenged, ... that
             finding on its own would  not  be  sufficient  to  refuse  the
             appeal.  Paragraph 67 of the FtT's decision is also challenged
             in the grounds of appeal.  Paragraphs 82 and 83 of  the  FtT's
             decision are undermined if the errors are made  out  as  there
             would have to be a re-assessment of whether the  appellant  is
             at risk.

             The appellant maintains that the FtT fell into error  for  the
             reasons set out at Ground 2(1).  The country information which
             is relied on is quoted at paragraph 19 of the  refusal  letter
             (see E7 of the Home Office's bundle).  The quotation states:

                  "... the party is a proscribed organisation  and  to  this
                  extent does not possess any  meaningful  hierarchy  as  we
                  would understand.  Communication among members  (ie  those
                  who have subscribed to the on  line,  what  I  might  call
                  "virtual party") is by email and blog ..."

             The country information indicates  that  it  is  communication
             between members which is done online.  It does not  state  how
             recruitment is undertaken.  Further, the  country  information
             relates to those who are already members.  Although the  party
             disseminates information, this is to  those  who  are  already
             members.

         ii) ... the country information indicates that communication among
             members ie those who have subscribed online is done by  email.
             However, as the ground states the FtT had no  or  insufficient
             evidence that the appellant  had  access  to  a  computer  and
             accordingly erred in law by falling into speculation;

        iii) The appellant maintains this ground is well-founded;

         iv) The appellant maintains this ground is well-founded;

          v) As pointed out  the  party  is  a  proscribed  party  and  the
             appellant maintains that in light of  that  there  is  a  real
             risk.  As noted above there  was  evidence  that  the  Chinese
             government  knew   of   the   appellant's   involvement   (the
             appellant's  testimony  is  evidence).   Even   if   the   FtT
             disbelieve that the appellant would not involve  herself  with
             the party on return, that does not matter if the  findings  in
             relation to the authorities wanting to find her are undermined
             by the errors in the grounds.

             Although there are 10 million members, these are said to be in
             the US, New Zealand, Taiwan and Canada (See G1 and G2  of  the
             Home Office's bundle).  It is very unclear  how  many  members
             are actually in China.

         vi) ... there is an error of law identified namely failing to take
             account and/or  assess  evidence  which  is  material  to  the
             outcome of the findings in this paragraph.

    Ground 3

      4. In relation to paragraph 7 of the respondent's written submissions,
         although the FtT had regard to the expert report (paragraph  86  of
         the FtT's decision), anxious scrutiny has  not  been  demonstrated.
         That is to say that not every factor in favour of the appellant has
         properly been taken into account.  ... the word "properly" is to be
         emphasised in order to show that lip service is not to be  paid  to
         the contents of the report.  In  particular  the  contents  of  the
         report were required to be anxiously scrutinised as  it  relied  on
         information which was either  not  considered  or  assessed  in  AX
         (family planning scheme) China CG [2012]  UKUT  00097I  (IAC)  (see
         paragraph 7 of the expert report).  The expert  report  focused  on
         the situation in Fujian  Province  (see  paragraphs  13-37  of  the
         expert report) whereas AX gave general guidance without focusing on
         a particular Province in China.  The guidance given  in  AX  is  of
         limited value where there is specific  information  relating  to  a
         specific   Province    especially    in    relation    to    forced
         sterilisation/forcible insertion of an IUD  (see  paragraphs  29-37
         and  47-49  of  the  expert  report  and  contrast  this  with  the
         generalised findings of AX at paragraph 180 and 184-185.

      5. The information contained  in  the  expert  report  looked  at  the
         specific practice in Fujian and from the expert report it  did  not
         appear that one needed to show there was  a  general  crackdown  to
         show the  appellant  was  at  risk  of  forcible  sterilisation  or
         forcible insertion of an IUD (see  the  paragraphs  of  the  expert
         report which are referred to in  these  submissions).   This  would
         undermine the findings at paragraph 89 of the FtT's decision.

      6.  In  relation  to  paragraphs  8-9  of  the  respondent's   written
         submissions, it is clear that even if the expert  report  does  not
         deal with foreign born children, paragraphs 61-66 of  AX  and  also
         paragraph 26.37 of the COI report make clear that there will be  no
         SUC imposed on foreign born children in  Fujian  Province  if  they
         fall into a particular exception.  None of the exceptions  set  out
         by the regulations applicable to Fujian apply to the appellant.

      7. In any event, the fact that the children have been born in  the  UK
         and outside of wedlock would not appear to change the fact that she
         would be required to either be subjected to forcible  sterilisation
         or be subject to forcible insertion of an IUD (see  the  paragraphs
         already cited above in relation to the expert's report).

      8. In relation to paragraph 9 of the respondent's written submissions:

          i)  although  there  is  protection   against   destitution,   an
             assessment would still have to be made as to whether it is  in
             the best interests of the child where they would  nevertheless
             suffer disadvantages by not being able to be registered  where
             the appellant is unlikely to be able to afford to pay the  SUC
             (see paragraphs 50-56 of the  expert  report).   AX  does  not
             appear to deal with the best interests of the child where  the
             SUC is not likely to be paid;

         ii) further AX looked at the situation of  couples  returning  and
             not single parents;

        iii) even if the SUC was paid  it  would  not  affect  whether  the
             appellant is to be forcibly  sterilised  or  be  subjected  to
             forcible insertion of an IUD;

      9.  In  relation  to  paragraph  10  of   the   respondent's   written
         submissions:

          i) the refusal letter did not say in absolute terms the appellant
             would receive �2000.  Indeed there was no evidence produced by
             the respondent  to  show  what  package  the  appellant  would
             obtain.

         ii) further ... even if the appellant can afford to pay  the  SUC,
             this would  not  appear  to  result  in  her  escaping  either
             forcible  sterilisation  or  being   subjected   to   forcible
             insertion of an IUD

     10. In relation to paragraphs 11 and 12  of  the  respondent's  written
         submissions:

          i) the expert acknowledges she looks at information  which  post-
             dates or which was not assess in AX (see paragraphs 7,  29-37,
             and 47-49 of her report);

         ii) although the expert has not footnoted or sourced paragraph  34
             of her report , it has to be borne in mind that the expert  is
             a source herself and indeed has sourced/footnoted many of  the
             other findings and the report has to be read as a whole;

        iii) the expert is simply saying that  her  view  is  supported  in
             terms of the decision of the  US  Court  of  Appeals  for  the
             Seventh Circuit;

         iv) the appellant in AX was from a different province than that of
             the present appellant;

          v)  the  expert  report  looks  at   the   issues   of   forcible
             sterilisation or forcible insertion of an IUD as they  pertain
             to Fujian Province (see paragraphs of the expert report  which
             have already been referred to) and in light of that  there  is
             sufficient  justification  for  departing  from  the   general
             guidance in AX;

         vi) although the FtT, at paragraph 89, follows the guidance of  AX
             in relation to internal relocation, the  expert's  information
             when dealing with internal  relocation  focuses  also  on  the
             impact that will have on the children (see paragraphs 57-65 of
             the expert report).   Such  information  as  to  how  internal
             relocation impacts on the children was  not  assessed  in  AX.
             The findings on internal flight in AX are found  at  paragraph
             191(14).

     11.  In  relation  to  paragraph  13  of   the   respondent's   written
         submissions, the appellant submits that the expert had  noted  that
         the relaxation of the family planning regulations would not resolve
         the appellant's fear (see paragraph 10 of the expert report).

     12. ... the foregoing errors and these submissions would also impact on
         the assessment of the best interests of the children undertaken  by
         the FtT at paragraphs 93-102.  For the reasons outlined in the oral
         submissions and above, it would not be in the best interests of the
         children to be returned to China.

     13. In light of the foregoing, there are material errors of  law.   The
         Upper Tribunal can remake  the  decision  itself  or  alternatively
         convene a further hearing to hear evidence de novo.

10. At the resumed hearing on 26 January 2016, subject to the  observations
    above regarding ground 1, I reserved my determination.

11. On ground 2, I have no difficulty in preferring the submissions for the
    respondent, for the reasons given by  Mr  Matthews.   The  matter  does
    overlap with ground 1.  There is no overall error in  arriving  at  the
    adverse credibility finding, for which the judge gave several  sensible
    reasons.  He found accordingly that the appellant's connection  to  the
    Xin Min Party was not established.  The claim to be at risk for reasons
    of political opinion was a very skimpy one.

12. I turn to ground 3.

13. The submission in the First-tier Tribunal regarding the  expert  report
    is recorded at paragraph 53.  It was based on  the  appellant  and  her
    partner being unmarried, unlike in AX; on her having breached a  number
    of conditions of family planning policy; on the fines involved; and  on
    the distinction, re forced sterilisation, that if the  appellant  could
    not pay compensation she would have to  undergo  that  procedure.   The
    judge said at paragraph 86 that he had given careful  consideration  to
    the report, but went on at paragraphs 88-90 to apply AX,  to the effect
    that financial consequences  did  not  generally  reach  the  necessary
    threshold of severity; risk of forced  abortion  or  sterilisation  was
    limited to instances of crackdowns  in  a  hukou  area;  there  was  no
    evidence that the appellant fell into that category; and any such  risk
    could in any event be avoided by moving to a city as many  millions  of
    Chinese internal migrants had done.  The judge at  paragraph  89  noted
    from the expert report that changes were to be implemented in  November
    2014 to allow two children, which might operate to the benefit  of  the
    appellant and her partner.  He concluded that there was no real risk of
    persecution or ill-treatment in China for  breach  of  family  planning
    regulations.

14. The appellant now argues that AX is of limited  value  where  there  is
    specific information relating to a  specific  province,  in  this  case
    Fujian.  However, the conclusions of  AX  on  internal  relocation  are
    general, not geographically restricted, so such information  would  not
    undermine the FtT's conclusions.

15. The expert, Ms Gordon, states at paragraph 7 that she defers to  recent
    Country of Origin Information Reports and to AX, and that she  presents
    primary  evidence  "collected  last  year"  and  not  included  in  AX.
    However,  the  appellant  has  not  demonstrated  that  there  is   any
    substantial evidence later than and different from that  considered  by
    the Tribunal in AX.  The expert quotes a few  individual  examples  she
    has encountered, in particular at paragraphs 31-33.  She draws  on  her
    own research to justify the  conclusion  at  paragraph  48  that  Hukou
    denial is an insurmountable barrier "for some  parents  across  China",
    having previously estimated that the number  of  children  unregistered
    and without Hukou is higher than the 13 million officially estimated.

16. There is nothing of substance in the report to displace the  conclusion
    in  AX  that  there  was  very  little  evidence   of   parents   being
    disproportionately penalised when they returned to China  with  foreign
    born children, even if they did so over and above the permitted  number
    for that couple, and that was not an outcome which placed them at  real
    risk.

17.  The  respondent  makes  a  reasonable  point  about  the  resettlement
    assistance available to the appellant (and her partner).   It  is  well
    known to practitioners within this jurisdiction that such packages  are
    available.  It is obvious that such  resources  would  go  a  long  way
    towards paying any social compensation fees.

18. There is no error in the conclusion that the application of AX  to  the
    facts of this  case  required  it  to  be  dismissed.   That  much  was
    effectively common ground.

19.  A  judge  is  required  to  apply  and  treat  country   guidance   as
    authoritative in  a  case  which  depends  upon  the  same  or  similar
    evidence.  The need to tackle that issue head on, if the appellant  was
    to succeed, was not well focused in the First-tier Tribunal and did not
    emerge until prompted by the judge granting  permission.    In  arguing
    the amended grounds, the appellant has not pointed to  any  substantial
    evidence underlying the expert report which is distinct in nature  from
    the evidence considered in AX.

20. Judge Bradshaw did not only say that he gave careful  consideration  to
    the report, he plainly did so; he makes specific further  reference  to
    it in paragraph 89.

21. The submissions about the best interests of the children seek to add to
    that aspect of the case but do not show any error, as the matter is  to
    be approached  on  the  basis  of  their  return  with  their  parents,
    resulting in no disadvantage greater than  any  other  ordinary  family
    returning to China.

22. The appellant's case, as fully developed in light of the observation in
    the grant of permission, does not disclose any material  error  in  the
    determination, and it shall stand.
