For the Appellant:     Ms I Vijiwale, Senior Home Officer presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Not legally represented


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals with permission against the decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Howard promulgated on 4 July 2019,  in  which
    Mr Azeem's appeal against the decision to refuse  his  application  for
    entry clearance dated 16 April 2018 was allowed.  For ease  I  continue
    to refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    with Mr Azeem as the Appellant  and  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
    Respondent.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan, born on 28 December 1988,  who
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the  spouse  of  a
    person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

 3. The Respondent refused the application for two  reasons.   First,  that
    the Appellant did not meet the suitability  requirements  for  a  grant
    because he had failed to disclose an unsuccessful application for entry
    clearance  made  in  2009.   Secondly,  the  financial  requirement  in
    Appendix FM  had  not  been  met  as  the  Sponsor's  income  was  only
    �17,307.72, short of the �18,600 required and  there  was  insufficient
    evidence of the required savings of �19,230.70 which would be needed to
    top up the income.  It was accepted that the Appellant was in a genuine
    and subsisting relationship with his partner in the United Kingdom  and
    that he satisfied the English language  requirements.   The  Respondent
    did not consider that  there  were  any  exceptional  circumstances  to
    warrant a grant of leave to remain outside of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    An entry clearance manager reviewed and maintained the decision  on  14
    November 2018.

 4. Judge Howard allowed the appeal in a decision  promulgated  on  4  July
    2019 on human rights grounds.  Although accepting  that  the  Appellant
    did not meet the suitability requirements  for  a  grant  of  leave  to
    remain as he had failed to disclose previous  unsuccessful  application
    for  entry  clearance,  it  was  found  that  the  Applicant  did  have
    sufficient earnings, together with a sufficient  level  of  savings  to
    meet the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM  to  the  Immigration
    Rules; matters which were taken into account in the assessment  of  the
    appeal on Article 8 grounds.  There was no  dispute  that  this  was  a
    genuine and subsisting marriage,  with  a  young  child  and  that  the
    refusal of entry clearance would be an interference with  the  family's
    right to respect for family life.

 5. When undertaking the final balancing exercise, the First-tier  Tribunal
    took into account the factors  in  section  117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, noting that the Appellant would not be
    a burden on the taxpayer given that the financial requirements had been
    met and that he was likely to be able to successfully  seek  employment
    in the United Kingdom as a primary school  teacher.   Further,  it  was
    noted that the Respondent had not alleged any dishonesty on the part of
    the Appellant nor any substantive reason why  his  earlier  application
    was refused that would have a bearing on  the  public  interest  to  be
    taken into account now, such that in  all  of  the  circumstances,  the
    weight to be attached to the maintenance  of  immigration  control  was
    limited and overall the public interest was  outweighed  in  favour  of
    admitting the Appellant to the United Kingdom to pursue family life and
    undertake his role as a parent.

The appeal

 6. The Respondent appeals on three grounds as follows.   First,  that  the
    decision  was  inconsistent  in  finding  first  that  the  suitability
    requirements had not been met by the Appellant, but later finding  that
    the requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules had been  met.
    The First-tier Tribunal erred in law in not properly factoring into the
    proportionality assessment for the purposes of Article  8,  the  public
    interest which went beyond the maintenance of immigration  control,  in
    circumstances  where  the  Appellant  could  not  meet   all   of   the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules for a grant of  leave  to  remain
    given his failure to  disclose  an  earlier  unsuccessful  application.
    Secondly, that the First-tier Tribunal erred in accepting the sponsor's
    income based on assertion in her evidence, without giving  reasons  for
    the finding that she would earn �18,200 per annum.  Thirdly,  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal erred in finding that the Appellant had  sufficient
    savings to supplement her income to the  required  level  to  meet  the
    financial requirements and fails to give  adequate  reasons  given  the
    reference to savings of �12,000 when over �19,000 was needed.

 7. At the oral hearing, on behalf of the Respondent, Ms Vijiwale made oral
    submissions only in respect of the first ground of appeal on the  basis
    that the Appellant's failure  to  meet  the  suitability  criteria  for
    failing to disclose  an  earlier  unsuccessful  application  for  entry
    clearance is significant, as is the mere fact that he did not meet  all
    of  the  requirements  for  a  grant  of  leave  to  remain  under  the
    Immigration Rules.  It  was  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to take this into account or attach appropriate  weight  to  it,
    leading to a failure to undertake a proper balancing exercise  for  the
    purposes of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

 8.  The  Appellant's  wife,  his  sponsor,  attended  the  oral   hearing,
    supporting the decision made by the First-tier Tribunal and emphasising
    that there was no dishonesty in the failure to disclose details of  the
    earlier unsuccessful application but that the Appellant was simply  not
    aware of all of the details having been the  victim  of  fraud  by  his
    previous  representatives  who  submitted  an  appeal  against  refusal
    without his knowledge.  In any event it was suggested that the  refusal
    was than 10 years ago should not be given significant weight in all the
    circumstances.

Findings and reasons

 1. In relation to the first ground of appeal, I do not find that there  is
    any material discrepancy in the decision as to  whether  the  Appellant
    can meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules for a grant of leave
    to remain, nor is there any  failure  when  undertaking  the  balancing
    exercise to attach weight to the fact that the Appellant could not meet
    the suitability requirements under Appendix FM.  In paragraph 17 of the
    decision, the First-tier Tribunal is satisfied  that  the  sponsor  has
    sufficient income and savings to satisfy that requirement  of  Appendix
    FM (my emphasis), i.e., the financial requirement and in paragraph  21,
    records that the Appellant fails to meet all  of  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM, by reference to the preceding three  paragraphs  referring
    to the suitability criteria.

 2. The later reference in paragraph 26(4) of the decision to the Appellant
    now meeting the relevant requirements of Appendix FM, in particular the
    financial threshold, is in the context of consideration of  the  public
    interest in section 117B(3) of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum
    Act 2002 only.  It is followed by a reference to  the  reality  of  the
    circumstances being  that  if  the  Appellant  were  to  make  a  fresh
    application for  entry  clearance,  disclosing  this  and  the  earlier
    unsuccessful  application,  he  would  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules for a grant of entry clearance.

 3. In any event, in the  final  substantive  paragraph  of  the  decision.
    There is express acknowledgement by the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  in
    this appeal the Immigration Rules were not met, with reasons then given
    as to why in all of the circumstances of the case,  the  weight  to  be
    attached to the maintenance of effective immigration control is limited
    and in any event the matters in favour of the  Appellant  outweigh  the
    public  interest  in   refusal,   such   that   the   decision   is   a
    disproportionate interference with his right to respect for private and
    family life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
     The weight to be attached to particular factors is primarily a  matter
    for the First-tier Tribunal and it is clear that all relevant  factors,
    including the failure to  meet  the  suitability  criteria,  have  been
    expressly taken into account and a conclusion reached which was open to
    the Judge on the facts when conducting the balancing  exercise.   There
    is no error of law on the first ground relied upon by the Respondent.

 4. The second and third grounds of challenge were not  pursued  orally  by
    the Respondent, given the view in the grant of  permission  that  these
    were not arguable.  For completeness, there is no material error of law
    on either of  these  two  grounds  given  that  there  was  documentary
    evidence in the form of the bank statement available before the  First-
    tier Tribunal showing savings of over �20,000, which is  sufficient  to
    cover any shortfall in earnings, either on the higher amount claimed by
    the Sponsor or on the lower amount supported by  documentary  evidence.
    On any view of the evidence, the financial requirements were met at the
    date of hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such  it  is  not  necessary  to  set
aside the decision.

The decision to allow the appeal is therefore confirmed.

No anonymity direction is made.
