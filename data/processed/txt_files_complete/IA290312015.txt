For the Respondent:    Mr A N Janjua of Counsel, instructed by Morden
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Metzer promulgated on 5 May  2017,  in  which  Ms  Naz's
    appeal against the decision to refuse  her  application  for  leave  to
    remain as a spouse dated 10  August  2015  was  allowed.   For  ease  I
    continue to refer to the parties as they  were  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, with Ms Naz as the Appellant and the Secretary  of  State  as
    the Respondent.

 2. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan  born  on  15  June  1979,  who
    entered the United Kingdom on 25 March 2012 with entry clearance  valid
    to 20 October 2014.  However,  the  Appellant's  leave  to  remain  was
    curtailed on 4 September 2013 to expire on 3 November 2013 as  she  had
    stopped studying.  The Appellant then made an application for leave  to
    remain as a spouse on 3 March 2015.

 3. The Respondent refused the application on 10 August 2015 for four  main
    reasons.  First, the application was refused under paragraph  S-LTR.2.2
    of Appendix FM on suitability grounds, that the Appellant's presence in
    the United Kingdom was not conducive to the  public  good  as  she  had
    fraudulently obtained an English language test certificate by  the  use
    of a proxy test taker, using deception in an application for  leave  to
    remain made on 30 October 2013.  Secondly, the Appellant did  not  meet
    the definition of 'partner' in Appendix FM because she was not married,
    nor had she cohabited with her sponsor for the required period of time.
     Thirdly, there was insufficient evidence that the Appellant's  sponsor
    satisfied the  maintenance  requirements  in  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.1  of
    Appendix FM.  Finally, the application was refused under  paragraph  E-
    LTRP.4.1 of Appendix FM as the Appellant failed  to  meet  the  English
    language requirements.

 4. The Respondent also  considered  the  Appellant's  private  life  under
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules, but she did not meet any  of
    the requirements therein as she had not resided in the  United  Kingdom
    for long enough and there were no very  significant  obstacles  to  her
    reintegration in to Pakistan where she had spent the  majority  of  her
    life.  There were no exceptional circumstances to warrant  a  grant  of
    leave to remain outside of the Immigration Rules.

 5. Judge Metzer allowed the appeal in a  decision  promulgated  on  5  May
    2017, under paragraph 287 of the Immigration Rules.   The  findings  on
    the appeal are contained in a single paragraph which found as follows:

         "Mr O'Monaghan on behalf of the Respondent accepted  that  most  of
         the  documents  to  support  the  alleged  deception  were  generic
         although there was reference to invalid tests  in  respect  of  the
         Appellant.  The generic  evidence  suggests  that  there  has  been
         widespread  fraud  in  relation  to  the  TOIEC  certificate   from
         Educational Testing Service (ETS).  However, there was no  evidence
         that the Appellant had used a proxy test taker  and  I  accept  the
         evidence of the Appellant that she did  attend  the  interview  and
         undertook the test in the way that she described.  Although  it  is
         not determinative at the hearing that she spoke fluent English,  it
         is a good indicator that she would have been able to pass the tests
         at the relevant time and I accept the Appellant's evidence that she
         did indeed attend and passed as she claimed.  In the circumstances,
         I find the Respondent has  failed  to  establish  to  the  relevant
         standard that the  Appellant  obtained  the  TOIEC  certificate  by
         deception.  In respect of the  financial  evidence,  I  accept  the
         evidence of the sponsor that he is employed  as  he  sets  out  and
         clearly met the threshold of ï¿½18,600 per year as  required  at  the
         time of  the  application  and  continues  to  meet  the  financial
         eligibility requirement."

The appeal

 6. The Secretary of State appeals on two grounds.  First, that the  First-
    tier Tribunal has failed to deal with all of the issues in the  appeal,
    making no findings at all on  the  reason  for  the  refusal  that  the
    Appellant could not meet the definition of 'partner' in Appendix FM  of
    the Immigration Rules.  In the absence of a positive finding  that  the
    requirement was met, the appeal could not have been allowed  under  the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. Secondly, that the First-tier  Tribunal  materially  erred  in  law  in
    relation to the use of  deception,  failing  to  correctly  assess  the
    burden of proof in accordance with SM  and  Qadir  (ETS  -  Evidence  -
    Burden of Proof) [2016]  UKUT  229;  with  findings  that  the  generic
    evidence was sufficient to discharge the initial evidential  burden  of
    proof on the Respondent and the burden then shifts to the Appellant  to
    provide an innocent explanation, if  so,  the  burden  reverts  to  the
    Respondent to discharge the legal burden.  The First-tier Tribunal  did
    not give sufficient reasons for finding that  the  Respondent  had  not
    discharged the final legal burden and no account was taken of MA (ETS -
    TOIEC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT  450  that  there  are  a  range  of
    reasons why a person proficient in English may  nonetheless  engage  in
    TOIEC fraud.

 8. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Frankish on 29 November 2017.
     At the time of consideration of  the  application  for  permission  to
    appeal, the file had been lost and permission was granted on the  basis
    that it was not possible to say that there was  no  arguable  error  of
    law.  The Respondent complied with the directions for the  file  to  be
    reconstituted for the purposes of the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

 9. At the oral hearing, Mr Tufan relied on the written grounds of  appeal,
    emphasising that the determination was very short and did  not  contain
    adequate reasons.   In  particular,  there  was  no  reference  to  any
    significant documents or evidence  and  no  reference  to  any  of  the
    applicable authorities on the use of deception in ETS/TOIEC cases.

10. Further, although not included in the original grounds  of  appeal,  it
    was submitted that there was an additional error of  law  in  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal allowed the  appeal  under  paragraph  287  of  the
    Immigration  Rules,  which  no  longer  exists.   The  application  and
    decision was expressly under Appendix FM and  the  appeal  should  have
    been determined by reference to those provisions.

11. Mr Janjua,  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  accepted  that  there  were
    difficulties with the findings made by the First-tier Tribunal and that
    the reasoning was very short.  However, he submitted that  in  relation
    to the ETS and deception point, the findings reflected how the case was
    put on behalf  of  the  Respondent  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In
    addition, there was a previous appeal  decision  which  considered  the
    Appellant's English language ability and she had previously passed  the
    entry clearance requirements  in  this  regard.   Mr  Janjua  therefore
    submitted that the findings in relation to  ETS  should  be  preserved,
    with only the issues in relation the relationship to be remitted.

Findings and reasons

 1. I find that the First-tier Tribunal materially  erred  in  law  on  all
    grounds identified by the Respondent.   The  very  short  determination
    with a single paragraph of findings is wholly inadequate.   First,  the
    decision fails to deal at all with the  reason  for  refusal  that  the
    Appellant did not meet the definition of 'partner' in Appendix  FM  and
    as such could not meet the main requirements for leave  to  remain  nor
    the alternative in paragraph EX.1.  That was a clear reason for refusal
    and an issue in the appeal which required express determination by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.  Secondly, the appeal is allowed  under  paragraph
    287 of the Immigration Rules which was  no  longer  in  force  and  not
    applicable at all to the Appellant's application and in any event could
    not  have  been  satisfied  without  an  express  finding  as  to   the
    Appellant's  relationship.   Thirdly,  the  mere  statement  that   the
    sponsor's evidence as to earnings was accepted fails to engage  at  all
    with the reason for refusal  or  the  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal upon which such a finding is based.

 2. Finally, I find that the First-tier Tribunal has failed to identify any
    of the applicable case law in relation to  deception  around  ETS/TOIEC
    English language tests and has not set out fully the burden of proof on
    this point, referring only  to  the  burden  being  on  the  Respondent
    without any reference to what has been referred  to  as  the  ping-pong
    burden in cases such as this where the initial evidential burden is  on
    the Respondent (where  the  generic  evidence  has  been  found  to  be
    sufficient), switching to the Appellant to give  a  plausible  innocent
    explanation and finally back to the Respondent to discharge  the  legal
    burden.  The reasons given do not  show  that  this  process  has  been
    applied nor considered and instead dismissed the Respondent's  evidence
    in the main because of its generic nature.  No account is taken of  the
    reasons why a person may engage  in  fraud  aside  from  their  English
    language ability.  There is also therefore a material error in  law  in
    failing to give adequate reasons for the decision.

 3. For these reasons, the decision must be set aside and  no  findings  of
    fact can be preserved.  The appeal is therefore remitted to the  First-
    tier Tribunal to be remade de novo.  It  is  not  appropriate  for  the
    appeal to be remade in the Upper Tribunal due  to  the  extensive  fact
    finding required to determine the appeal on all grounds.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of a material error of law.  As such it is  necessary  to  set  aside
the decision.

I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  and  remit  it  to  the
First-tier Tribunal (Taylor House hearing centre)  for  a  de  novo  hearing
before any Judge except Judge Metzer.

No anonymity direction is made.
