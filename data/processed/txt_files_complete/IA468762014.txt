Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr M Rayaz, instructed by Rasools Law
For the respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Asad Shahbaz, date of birth 15.12.93, is  a  citizen  of
    Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Edwards promulgated 10.3.15, dismissing his appeal against the decision
    of the Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  his  application  for  an  EEA
    Residence Card as confirmation of a right to reside in the  UK  as  the
    spouse of an EEA national exercising Treaty  rights,  pursuant  to  the
    Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    6.3.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Davidge  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    11.5.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein granted permission  to  appeal
    on 8.7.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 8.10.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find that there was no material  error
    of law in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such as
    to required the decision of Judge Edwards to be set aside.

 6. I note that there are a number of errors in the grant of permission. At
    �3 Judge Goldstein found arguable merit  in  the  submission  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge's  finding  that  the  marriage  was  one  of
    convenience was perverse or irrational "when there was evidence  before
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the appellant was pregnant and as to
    the appellant's paternity." First, it was not the  male  appellant  who
    was pregnant, nor was the appellant's paternity in  issue,  but  rather
    the paternity of the then unborn child. Second, it is  not  clear  that
    there was any evidence of paternity at all. As Mr Rayaz  suggested,  it
    would be difficult to have evidence of paternity when the child was not
    yet born.

 7. However, on the core finding of the decision, I find no error of law in
    the conclusion that the marriage was one of convenience. Although Judge
    Edwards did not specifically refer to Papajorgji (EEA spouse - marriage
    of convenience) Greece [2012] UKUT 00038 (IAC), at �9 the judge pointed
    out that it was for the Secretary of State  to  establish  at  least  a
    prima facie case that the marriage was one of convenience.  Thereafter,
    the burden falls on the appellant on the balance  of  probabilities  to
    demonstrate that it is not a marriage of convenience.

 8. I reject the  submission  of  Mr  Rayaz  that  at  �23  the  judge  was
    propounding a perverse and new principle of law in the comment, "I note
    the fact that the sponsor is pregnant, allegedly by the appellant. That
    really adds little. If a marriage is one of convenience, there can also
    be children of convenience." The comment was no more than the  obvious,
    that the fact that a child was expected is not by itself  determinative
    of a genuine or subsisting marriage. As the judge stated,  and  bearing
    in mind there was no evidence  of  paternity  at  the  time,  it  added
    little.

 9. I also reject the submission that the judge failed to  have  regard  to
    all the relevant evidence in the case. Mr Rayaz relied on  evidence  of
    different addresses, photographs and a marriage certificate. These were
    matters considered by the judge. For example, at �15 the judge referred
    to the evidence of  different  addresses,  but  noted  that  there  was
    limited evidence in joint  names.  At  �22  the  judge  summarised  the
    quality of the evidence as "lamentably  sketchy.  There  is  little  or
    nothing to show a joint establishment."

10. Mr Rayaz suggested that there was a mistake of fact  at  �15  when  the
    judge referred to the sponsor's evidence that two other people lived at
    325 [ - ], Bolton, adding, "The sponsor said one of them was a relative
    of the appellant, but she did not know their names." At �21  the  judge
    found the evidence of the appellant and the sponsor unsatisfactory, and
    referred to discrepancies between them, adding, "I  do  not  accept  Mr
    Rayaz's point that it would be understandable for the  sponsor  not  to
    know the names her flat-mates, particularly when one was  apparently  a
    relative of her husband." Mr Rayaz disputed that the sponsor  had  said
    in evidence that one of the other occupants was a relative  whose  name
    she did not know. However, that is entirely consistent with the judge's
    handwritten notes forming the record of proceedings. If Mr Rayaz wanted
    to challenge the accuracy, he should have produced better evidence than
    merely his assertion in submissions to me.

11. Much of Mr Rayaz's submissions amounted to no more than a  disagreement
    with the findings and conclusions of the judge, suggesting to  me  that
    more weight should have  been  given  to  the  evidence  favouring  the
    appellant. However, weight is a matter for the judge to assess, in  the
    round in the context of the evidence as a whole. I find  that  although
    the decision is  relatively  brief,  there  is  no  evidence  that  the
    decision was not made after taking into account all of the evidence  in
    the round. The grounds and submissions are simply disagreements and  do
    not disclose any material error of law. There is nothing in the matters
    submitted to me to  demonstrate  that  the  decision  was  perverse  or
    irrational.

12. In the circumstances, and for the reasons stated, there is no  material
    error in the making of Judge Edwards' decision.

Conclusions:

13. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There is no merit in the grounds of appeal against the decision  of
the First-tier Tribunal and the appeal remains dismissed.
