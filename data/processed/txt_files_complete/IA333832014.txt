For the Appellant:     Mr Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The application for permission to appeal was made by the  Secretary  of
    State but for the purposes of  this  decision  I  shall  refer  to  the
    parties as they were described  before  the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  in
    particular Mr Haq as the appellant.

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 19th October 1985 and he
    appealed against the refusal of his  application  dated  12th  February
    2014 for leave to remain as the spouse of Rabbiya Seher Rehman.

 3. The Secretary of State considered refused the application on 7th August
    2014 under Appendix FM, in particular R-LTRP.1.1.:

    "Section R-LTRP: Requirements for limited leave to remain as a partner

    R-LTRP.1.1.   The requirements to be met for limited leave to remain as
                a partner are -

                (a)    the applicant and their partner must be in the UK;

                (b)    the applicant must have made a valid application  for
                    limited or indefinite leave to remain as a partner;  and
                    either

                (c)

                    (i)    the applicant must not  fall  for  refusal  under
                        Section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

                    (ii)   the applicant meets all of  the  requirements  of
                        Section E-LTRP: Eligibility for leave to remain  as
                        a partner; or

                (d)

                    (i)    the applicant must not  fall  for  refusal  under
                        Section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

                    (ii)    the  applicant   meets   the   requirements   of
                        paragraphs E-LTRP.1.2-1.12. and E- LTRP.2.1.; and

                    (iii)  paragraph EX.1. applies."

 4. The appellant was notified that  his  application  was  refused  solely
    because he  did  not  meet  the  income  threshold  requirements  under
    Appendix FM.  His  application  had  been  previously  placed  on  hold
    pending the pronouncement of R (MM & Others) v  SSHD  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    985, that is the legal challenge to the income  threshold  requirement.
    It was considered that his application for leave to remain was  refused
    because he did not meet the income threshold requirement under Appendix
    FM and the related evidential requirements under Appendix FM-SE.   That
    income requirement was �18,600 per annum.

 5. The appellant had failed to  provide  the  specified  documentation  to
    evidence that he and his spouse had an annual income of  �18,600  prior
    to the date of the application and he had failed  to  provide  evidence
    that his spouse had an annual income of �13,924 from self-employment.

 6. EX.1. was also considered:

    "EX.1.   This paragraph applies if

           (a)    (i)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting  parental
                relationship with a child who -

                    (aa)   is under the age of 18 years, or  was  under  the
                        age of  18  years  when  the  applicant  was  first
                        granted leave on  the  basis  that  this  paragraph
                        applied;

                    (bb)   is in the UK;

                    (cc)   is a British Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                        continuously for at least the 7  years  immediately
                        preceding the date of application; and

                (ii)   it would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                    leave the UK; or

           (b)    the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
                with a partner who is in the UK and is  a  British  Citizen,
                settled in the UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
                humanitarian  protection,  and  there   are   insurmountable
                obstacles  to  family  life  with  that  partner  continuing
                outside the UK."

 7.  EX.2.  -  for  the  purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
    obstacles"' meant very significant difficulties which would be faced by
    the applicant or their partner in continuing their family life together
    outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
    serious hardship.  He had failed to  provide  documentary  evidence  to
    demonstrate that he was  the  parent  of  a  child  and  therefore  his
    application failed under EX.1.(a) and he had not demonstrated  why  his
    relationship could not continue in the country of origin and  therefore
    he failed under EX.1.(b).

 8. Again there were no exceptional circumstances to  consider  the  matter
    outside the Immigration Rules.

 9. The appeal came before Tribunal Judge Walker, who  allowed  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  He identified that the respondent did not
    specify  how  the  appellant  had  failed  to   meet   the   evidential
    requirements.

Application for Permission to Appeal

10. The respondent made an application for  permission  to  appeal  on  the
    basis that the Rules of specified evidence are comprehensively set  out
    in Appendix FM-SE.  These set out the types of evidence  required,  the
    periods covered and the format they should be in.  At paragraph  31  of
    the  decision  the  Tribunal  ignored  this.   For  Appendix   FM   the
    significant date is the date of the  application  and  the  significant
    evidence is from the specified period before that date.   The  Tribunal
    had not addressed the relevant evidence from  prior  to  12th  February
    2014.  It was not clear what the sponsor's actual gross income  was  at
    the date of the application.  It also followed that  the  appeal  could
    not therefore be made out.  If the sponsor's current income did  exceed
    the income threshold there was  no  reason  to  prevent  the  appellant
    making a fresh application based on the sponsor's income at  this  time
    along with the requisite specified evidence.

11. The application for permission to appeal was initially refused by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Lever but on renewal  of  the  application  to  the
    Upper Tribunal granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker,  who  stated  it
    appeared the First-tier Tribunal Judge was confused as  to  whether  it
    was an entry clearance appeal or an in country appeal.

The Hearing

12. The appellant did not attend the hearing despite having been  forwarded
    a notice of the hearing on 8th May 2015 to his last home address.  I am
    satisfied that the appellant received the date, time and venue  of  the
    hearing on the basis that he  submitted  a  written  skeleton  argument
    received at Field House on 28th May 2015.

13. Mr Jarvis made submissions on the basis that the demands of  the  Rules
    under FM-SE  were  definite  and  in  particular  the  requirements  in
    relation to employment were based on a timeline, that is the  appellant
    had to show evidence six or twelve months prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application which in this case was 12th February 2014.  The  judge  had
    found that the cumulative total in week 52 for employment  in  2013  to
    2014 was �3,522.59 but  the  judge  had  not  set  out  the  evidential
    requirements for Appendix FM-SE.

14. There were  further  numerous  layers  of  evidential  requirements  in
    relation  to  self-employment  and  the  judge  had   set   out   those
    requirements at paragraph 11 of his determination but the  findings  of
    the judge did not address all of the requisite elements  of  the  self-
    employment evidential requirements.

15. The appellant could not comply with the evidential requirements.

16. Mr Jarvis also submitted that there were no compelling reasons for  the
    matter to be considered outside the Immigration Rules and  referred  me
    to SS (Congo) which  confirms  that  the  requirements  of  FM-SE  were
    justifiable.  The fact that his wife was now pregnant was not relevant.
     The failure to meet the Rules was significant.

Conclusions

17. Under  paragraph  E-LTRP.3.1.  the  applicant  must  provide  specified
    evidence, from the sources listed in paragraph E-LTRP.3.2., of -

    (a)  a specified gross annual income of at least -

         (i)  �18,600.

18. Appendix FM-SE sets out the specified evidence to  meet  the  financial
    requirements for both employment and  self-employment,  under  Appendix
    FM.

    'D.  (a) In deciding an application in relation to which this Appendix
         states that specified documents must be provided, the Entry
         Clearance Officer or Secretary of State ("the decision-maker") will
         consider documents that have been submitted with the application,
         and will only consider documents submitted after the application
         where sub-paragraph (b) or (e) applies.

         (b)  If the applicant:

             (i)  has submitted:

                  (aa) a sequence of documents and some of the documents in
                  the sequence have been omitted (e.g. if one bank statement
                  from a series is missing);

                  (bb) a document in the wrong format (for example, if a
                  letter is not on letterhead paper as specified); or

                  (cc) a document that is a copy and not an original
                  document; or

                  (dd) a document which does not contain all of the
                  specified information; or

             (ii) has not submitted a specified document,

             the decision-maker may contact the applicant or his
             representative in writing or otherwise, and request the
             document(s) or the correct version(s). The material requested
             must be received at the address specified in the request
             within a reasonable timescale specified in the request.

         (c)  The decision-maker will not request documents where he or she
         does not anticipate that addressing the error or omission referred
         to in sub-paragraph (b) will lead to a grant because the
         application will be refused for other reasons.

         (d)  If the applicant has submitted:

             (i)  a document in the wrong format; or

             (ii) a document that is a copy and not an original document,
             or

             (iii)    a document that does not contain all of the specified
             information, but the missing information is verifiable from:

                  (1)  other documents submitted with the application,

                  (2)  the website of the organisation which issued the
                  document, or

                  (3)  the website of the appropriate regulatory body,

             the application may be granted exceptionally, providing the
             decision-maker is satisfied that the document(s) is genuine
             and that the applicant meets the requirement to which the
             document relates. The decision-maker reserves the right to
             request the specified original document(s) in the correct
             format in all cases where sub-paragraph (b) applies, and to
             refuse applications if this material is not provided as set
             out in sub-paragraph (b).

         (e)  Where the decision-maker is satisfied that there is a valid
         reason why a specified document(s) cannot be supplied, e.g. because
         it is not issued in a particular country or has been permanently
         lost, he or she may exercise discretion not to apply the
         requirement for the document(s) or to request alternative or
         additional information or document(s) be submitted by the
         applicant.

         (f)  Before making a decision under Appendix FM or this Appendix,
         the decision-maker may contact the applicant or their
         representative in writing or otherwise to request further
         information or documents. The material requested must be received
         at the address specified in the request within a reasonable
         timescale specified in the request.

    In addition at

    "2.  In  respect  of  salaried  employment  in  the  UK  (except  where
    paragraph 9 applies), all of the following evidence must be provided:

         (a)  Payslips covering:

             (i)  a period of 6 months prior to the date of application  if
                  the person has been employed by their current employer for
                  at least 6 months  (and  where  paragraph  13(b)  of  this
                  Appendix does not apply); or

             (ii) any period of salaried employment in  the  period  of  12
                  months prior to the date of application if the person  has
                  been employed by their current employer for  less  than  6
                  months (or at least 6 months but the person does not  rely
                  on paragraph 13(a) of this Appendix), or in the  financial
                  year(s) relied upon by a self-employed person.

         (b)  A letter from the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at

             (ii) the length of their employment;

             been paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

         (d)  Where the person is a director of a limited company  based  in
             the UK, evidence that the company is not of a  type  specified
             in paragraph 9(a). This can include the latest  Annual  Return
             filed at Companies House.

    ....

    7.   In respect of self-employment in the UK as a partner,  as  a  sole
         trader or in a franchise all of the following must be provided:

         (a)  Evidence of the amount of tax payable, paid and unpaid for the
             last full financial year.

             years):

             (i)   annual self-assessment tax return to  HMRC  (a  copy  or

         (e)  Where the person  holds  or  held  a  separate  business  bank
             account(s), bank statements for the same  12-month  period  as
             the tax return(s).

         (f)  personal bank statements for the same 12-month period  as  the
             tax return(s) showing that the income from self-employment has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.

         (g)   Evidence  of  ongoing  self-employment  through  evidence  of
             payment of Class 2 National Insurance contributions, or (where
             the person has reached state pension age) through  alternative
             evidence (which may include, but is not confined to,  evidence
             of  ongoing  payment  of  business   rates,   business-related
             insurance premiums, employer National Insurance  contributions
             or franchise payments to the parent company).

         (h)  One of the following documents must also be submitted:

             (i)  (aa)     if the business is required  to  produce  annual
                  audited  accounts,  such  accounts  for  the   last   full
                  financial year; or

                  (bb) if the business is not  required  to  produce  annual
                  audited accounts, unaudited accounts  for  the  last  full
                  financial  year  and  an   accountant's   certificate   of
                  confirmation, from an accountant who is a member of  a  UK
                  Recognised Supervisory Body (as defined in  the  Companies
                  Act 2006);

             (ii) a certificate of VAT registration and the VAT return  for
                  the  last  full  financial  year  (a  copy  or  print-out)
                  confirming the VAT registration number, if turnover is  in
                  excess of �79,000 or was in excess of the threshold  which
                  applied during the last full financial year;

             (iii)    evidence to show appropriate planning  permission  or
                  local planning authority consent is held  to  operate  the
                  type/class of business at the trading address (where  this
                  is a local authority requirement); or

             (iv) a franchise agreement signed by both parties.

         (i)  The  document  referred  to  in  paragraph  7(h)(iv)  must  be
             provided if the organisation is a franchise."

19. The requirements  are  extensive.   Although  the  judge  set  out  the
    requirements  for  self-employment  there  was  no  reference  to   the
    requirements in respect of salaried employment, although the judge took
    this figure into account.   As  can  be  seen  from  above  a  specific
    requirement under 2(b) a letter  is  required  from  the  employer  who
    issued the payslips at paragraph 2(a) confirming:

         (i)  the person's employment and gross annual salary;

         (ii) the length of their employment;

         (iii)    the period over which they have  been  or  were  paid  the
             level of salary relied upon in the application; and

         (iv) the type of  employment  (permanent,  fixed-term  contract  or
             agency).

20. There was no indication that the judge had addressed this issue.

21. With respect to the payslips for the appellant's name  referred  to  at
    paragraph 24 of the judge's decision he stated as follows:

         "Copy payslips in the appellant's name for weeks 31,  32,  33,  34,
         35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 have been filed.  Who  issued  these
         or in what year are not ascertainable because of the  poor  quality
         of the photocopies.  There part of a reference to JD Sports Fashion
         PLC in week 41 but it is still not sufficiently clear to know  that
         they issued that payslip.  The cumulative total appearing  in  week
         44 was �2,516.13."

22. The judge  then  went  on  to  record  that  the  total  shown  by  the
    appellant's P60 for the tax year ending 2014 was gross �3,522.59 [25].

23. The judge stated at [27] of the decision that

         "... an extract of the appellant's tax  return  for  2013-2014  has
         been filed and shows payments from self-employment of  �15,614  and
         from employment of �3,522" (totalling �19,136).

24. In his findings with respect to the self-employment, the judge referred
    to the requirements but did not apply them for the relevant period. For
    the purposes of the Rules the date on which an application or claim  is
    made is the date on which the application form is  sent  by  post,  the
    date of posting, or, where the form is submitted in person the date  on
    which it is accepted by the Home Office, or, where made by courier  the
    date on which it is  delivered  to  the  Home  Office,  or,  where  the
    application is made via the online application process on the  date  on
    which the online application is submitted.  (Rule 34 of the Immigration
    Rules).

25. At [28] the judge recorded that a letter dated 7th February  2014  from
    Azed & Co certified public accountants stated that  the  appellant  had
    filed a tax return for the year ended  5th  April  2013.   Further  the
    appellant had a taxable profit of �13,924 for period 1st April 2013  to
    1st January 2014.  A further letter from Azed &  Co  dated  24th  April
    2014 showed for the year period to 31st March 2014  the  self  employed
    profit was �15,614. A letter from the  appellant  dated  5th  May  2014
    included the letter dated 24th April from Azed & Co together  with  tax
    documentation and certificate which showed the income  from  both  self
    employment and employment of �19,136, to  demonstrate  compliance  with
    the rules.

26. The judge found at [31]:

         "In order to meet the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE the
         appellant must meet the requirements of para 7 set out above.   The
         amount of tax payable for the last financial year  is  included  in
         the tax return and his National Insurance number  is  contained  in
         the tax return  as  well  as  in  his  payslips.   His  Unique  Tax
         Reference Number is also contained in the return.  He has filed  12
         months of bank statements and the total of the  payments  into  the
         account for the year is �67,427.65 which  of  course  includes  the
         salary payments but it follows that since the letter from Azad & Co
         refers to gross income of �48,862  from  self-employment  the  bank
         statement income is more than  commensurate  with  the  appellant's
         income  from  self-employment.   The  appellant  has  supplied   an
         accountant's certificate  as  to  his  income  in  the  year  ended
         05.04.2014 and shows the appellant's income to be �19,136.00.   The
         letter from Azad & Co dated 24.04.2014 refers  to  the  profit  and
         loss account accounts.  Their letter heading states that  they  are
         certified public accountants.  The respondent did not assert in the
         refusal letter that Azad & Co is not a member of a recognised  body
         and I consider that if that was the piece of information  that  the
         respondent  considered  was  defective  then  it  would  have  been
         mentioned specifically in the letter of refusal.  I  also  consider
         the evidential flexibility which is embodied within Appendix  FM-SE
         and note that this is unlikely  to  have  been  applied  since  the
         respondent has not mentioned in the refusal letter what evidence is
         complained of",

27. The judge erred in taking figures from the income from  self-employment
    from the financial year which ends after the date  of  the  application
    which was in February 2014.  It is  clear  that  in  respect  of  self-
    employment the evidence at 7(a) should be "evidence of  the  amount  of
    tax payable, paid and unpaid for the last full financial year" prior to
    the application.  The  judge  misconstrued  this  and  took  the  self-
    employment of �19,136  for  the  year  ending  April  2014  [31].   The
    evidential flexibility rule is not applicable in this circumstance.

28. The bank statements filed were from 23rd February 2013  to  25th  April
    2014.  These also post dated the application date. As such the personal
    bank statements for the requisite same twelve month period were not  in
    existence either.

29. Even if the evidence should have been considered with the  letter  from
    the appellant dated 5th May 2014 (which I do not accept as it was after
    the application), as can be seen there was no employers' letter and  no
    mention of an employers' letter within the decision.  Thus  the  income
    from Cars Zone of �15,614 to 31st March 2014 could not be  supplemented
    by the income from the employment of �3,522.

30.  I  considered  EX.1  (with  reference  to  EX,2)  in  respect  of  the
    application but am not persuaded on the evidence  that  there  are  any
    significant difficulties, let alone very significant difficulties, that
    would be faced by the appellant or there partner  in  continuing  their
    family life together outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or
    would entail serious hardship. In effect there was  a  bald  assertion,
    rather than any specific evidence, that the parties could not  relocate
    because they had an established life in the UK and the wife  had  lived
    all her life her.   The wife  has  indeed  visited  Pakistan  with  her
    family and must have links there. However she will  be  relocating,  if
    she wishes, with her husband.

31. I find that there is an  error  of  law  and  therefore  I  remake  the
    decision and dismiss Mr Ul Haq's appeal under the Immigration Rules for
    failure to comply with the specific evidential requirements as  at  the
    relevant date.

32. I note that there was no reference to Article 8 despite the  fact  that
    the grounds of appeal were lodged on the basis that the  appellant  had
    an Article 8 right to remain in the UK.

33. I acknowledge that  the  appeal  was  lodged  on  the  basis  that  the
    appellant was married to a British national but there  was  a  distinct
    paucity of evidence produced in relation to the appellant's claim and a
    distinct paucity of information regarding  any  Article  8  claim.   At
    paragraph 2 of his further submissions the appellant stated:

         "It is not reasonable or just for my wife who is a British  citizen
         since birth to relocate to Pakistan.  Firstly  she  has  lived  her
         whole life here in the UK and does not hold any ties  in  Pakistan,
         as all her close  family  including  both  her  parents,  siblings,
         grandparents, all extended relatives and friends are here  residing
         in the UK.  She has only been to Pakistan on  family  visits  under
         the age of 16 as a child with her parents, and the  last  time  she
         went to Pakistan was also with her family in 2008 which  was  seven
         years ago.  Hence it would be unreasonable and unjust  to  consider
         her relocating to Pakistan  as  this  would  immensely  affect  her
         emotional and social set-up and would have a detrimental effect  on
         her health.

         Furthermore, my wife is fully financially dependent on me as  shown
         in the documents provided, I am the only person who is earning  and
         providing for my family.  Also, as we are renting at the moment all
         rent and bills are also being  paid  by  myself.   As  my  wife  is
         currently pregnant and we are expecting a baby in October 2015, she
         is unable to currently work as she  has  been  extremely  ill  with
         regards to pregnancy symptoms and is also lacking energy which  has
         had a  huge  effect  on  her  health.   Hence,  my  wife  is  fully
         financially dependent on me.  Therefore  our  child  will  also  be
         fully financially dependent on me."

34. I can accept that the appellant has established a  private  and  family
    life in the UK with his wife but I have considered  whether  there  are
    any compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
    Rules and Appendix FM which incorporate considerations under Article  8
    further to MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT  00393  (IAC)
    and Nagre (on the application of) v Secretary of State [2013] EWHC 720.
     Of particular relevance in this case is that  MM  (Lebanon)  confirmed
    that the financial requirements under the Immigration Rules were lawful
    and SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 confirms that the requirements under
    Appendix FM-SE are justifiable, in particular:

         "55.  In  our  judgment,  the  true  position  lies  between  these
             submissions.  Contrary to the  argument  of  the  respondents,
             that fact that an applicant may be able to say that their case
             is a 'near miss' in relation to satisfying the requirements of
             the Rules will by no means show that compelling  circumstances
             exist requiring the grant of LTE outside the  Rules.   A  good
             deal more than this would need to be shown to make out such  a
             case.  The respondents' argument fails to recognise the  value
             to be attached to having a clear statement  of  the  standards
             applicable to everyone and fails to give proper weight to  the
             judgment of the Secretary of State, as expressed in the Rules,
             regarding what is needed to meet the public interest which  is
             in issue.  The 'near miss' argument of the respondents  cannot
             be sustained in the light  of  these  considerations  and  the
             authority of Miah v Secretary of State for the Home Department
             [2012] EWCA Civ 261, especially at [21]-[26].

         56.  However, it cannot be said that the fact that a case  involves
             a 'near miss' in relation to the requirements set out  in  the
             Rules is wholly irrelevant to the balancing exercise  required
             under Article 8.  If an applicant  can  show  that  there  are
             individual interests at stake covered by Article 8 which  give
             rise to a strong claim that compelling circumstances may exist
             to justify the grant of LTE outside the Rules, the  fact  that
             their case is also a  'near  miss'  case  may  be  a  relevant
             consideration which tips the balance under Article 8 in  their
             favour.  In such a case, the applicant will  be  able  to  say
             that the detrimental impact on the public interest in issue if
             LTE is granted in their favour will be somewhat less than in a
             case where the gap between the applicant's  position  and  the
             requirements of the Rules is great, and the risk that they may
             end up having  recourse  to  public  funds  and  resources  is
             therefore greater."

35. Even if the application were considered outside the  Immigration  Rules
    and I find no reason to do so, there is a legitimate aim being  pursued
    in denying leave to remain to a spouse in the claimant's circumstances,
    who does not comply with the rules on admission.  It  is  open  to  the
    appellant to return to Pakistan and make an application  for  leave  to
    remain from there.  This is  not  a  case  where  the  application  has
    fulfilled all the essential requirements and the  requirement  that  he
    leave the UK is just a formal requirement.  I take  note  of  the  fact
    that the appellant claims that his wife is a British citizen and I take
    this into account.  Article 8 does not oblige  states  to  respect  the
    choice by married couples of their matrimonial residence or  to  accept
    the settlement of a non-national spouse in the country.   The  relevant
    principles were articulated in Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali  v  UK
    [1985] 7 EHRR 471.   It is clear that the wife still has connections to
    Pakistan but she married the appellant knowing that he had entered  the
    UK as a student and had only been in the UK  for  four  years  and  had
    spent the majority of his life in Pakistan.  She knew  that  he  had  a
    precarious status.  I make it clear she is not required  to  leave  the
    European Union.  It is a matter of choice.

36. The appellant's parents and siblings continue to reside in Pakistan and
    I also note that the appellant's wife has connections and  has  in  the
    past visited family in  Pakistan.  There  was  no  independent  medical
    evidence before me that the wife had any significant medical conditions
    with her pregnancy or that there is no healthcare in the event that she
    wishes to give birth in Pakistan.  I take the  point  that  SS  (Congo)
    refers to leave to enter  rather  than  leave  to  remain  but  in  the
    assessment of proportionality I find no reason why he cannot return and
    make an application from  abroad.   He  cannot  comply  with  Paragraph
    276ADE as he has not been in the United Kingdom for 20 years and  there
    are no very significant obstacles to his  re-integration  in  Pakistan,
    and, with regards any  private  life,   I  must  specifically  consider
    Section 117B of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act.   The
    appellant was clear that his wife was fully dependent on him and as has
    been  indicated  he  could  not  satisfy   the   financial   evidential
    requirements.  I am not satisfied either that the appellant  would  not
    be a financial burden on the  UK  economy  and  further  there  was  no
    specific evidence that the appellant could indeed speak English.

37. I find that the decision to  refuse  the  appellant's  application  for
    leave to remain is proportionate, Huang v SSHD [2007] UKHL  11,  taking
    full account of all considerations, I did not consider that any  family
    or private life of the claimant was prejudiced in a manner sufficiently
    serious to amount to a breach of the  fundamental  right  protected  by
    Article 8.
