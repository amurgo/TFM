For the Appellant:     Mr O'Ryan
For the Respondent:    Mrs Brewer, Home Office Presenting Officer


                               DECISION NOTICE


 1. This notice of decision is made with the consent of  both  parties,  Mr
    O'Ryan for Mrs PB and Mrs Brewer for the Secretary  of  State  for  the
    Home Department.

 2. Both parties are agreed I have no jurisdiction to hear what purports to
    be "an appeal" by Mrs PB against the decision of the Secretary of State
    to refuse to grant her, a citizen of Iran, asylum as  a  refugee  under
    the UN Convention.

 3. The short history  of  this  matter  was  outlined  by  Mr  O'Ryan  who
    represented Mrs PB before me on 13th February 2014.

 4. Mrs PB entered the United Kingdom on 19th August 2010 together with her
    husband and 5 year old daughter. She entered  as  a  dependent  of  her
    husband who had a Tier 2 visa. He was an employee of Iranian Airways, a
    government owned company. Their second child was  born  in  the  United
    Kingdom on 30th August 2012. Following the birth of  the  second  child
    relations between the spouses deteriorated.

 5. Prior to this Mrs PB's leave  was  renewed  (along  with  that  of  her
    husband) and she was granted limited leave to remain extant  until  6th
    May 2015. That leave remains in force.

 6. Mrs PB's husband left the United Kingdom and returned to Iran, but just
    prior to leaving, she applied for asylum.

 7. On 14th August  2013  Mrs  PB  was  issued  with  a  decision  entitled
    "Rejection of asylum claim"; but no removal directions were given.  The
    notice which was dated 14th August 2013 purported to give her  a  right
    of appeal under Section 83(2) of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002. Clearly no removal directions were issued because Mrs PB  had
    extant leave until May 2015 and that leave has never been curtailed.

 8. As Mr O'Ryan pointed out (and  Mrs  Brewer  acknowledged)  a  right  of
    appeal is governed by Section 83 and Section 82(ii)(d) of the 2002 Act.
    Mrs PB has extant leave which has not been curtailed. Therefore at  the
    date of decision purporting to refuse her  asylum  she  was  not  in  a
    position of having no leave to enter or remain. She  had  extant  leave
    until 2015. Therefore the notice dated 14th August 2013  purporting  to
    give Mrs PB a right of appeal under Section  83  of  the  2002  Act  is
    incorrect. I have no jurisdiction in this matter.

 9. No Jurisdiction.

Direction regarding anonymity - rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration
Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005

The appellant is granted anonymity throughout these proceedings, unless  and
until the Tribunal directs otherwise. No report of these  proceedings  shall

direction applies both to the Appellant and to the  Respondent.  Failure  to
comply with this direction could lead to contempt of Court proceedings.
