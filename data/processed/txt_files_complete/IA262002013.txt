                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No appearance

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against a decision of  the
      First-tier Tribunal (Judge Deavin) which allowed the claimant's appeal
      under the Immigration Rules (Appendix FM) against a  refusal  to  vary
      her leave made on 23 July 2013 on the  basis  of  her  marriage  to  a
      British citizen, Stephen Heaven.

   2. For convenience, I will refer to the parties as they  appeared  before
      the First-tier Tribunal.

Background

   3. The appellant is a citizen of Vietnam who was born on 5 May 1986.   On
      23 December 2013, she entered the United Kingdom  as  a  visitor  with
      entry clearance valid until 12 June  2013.   On  29  April  2013,  she
      married Stephen Heaven, a British citizen (the "sponsor").  On 10 June
      2013, she made an in-time application for further leave to  remain  as
      his spouse under Appendix FM.  That was refused by  the  Secretary  of
      State on 23 July 2013.

The Appeal

   4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  appeal  was
      determined by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Deavin) on the papers  as
      no oral hearing was requested.  He accepted that the parties' marriage
      was a "genuine  and  subsisting  relationship"  and  that,  given  the
      serious health condition of the sponsor,  there  were  "insurmountable
      obstacles" to the appellant and sponsor continuing their  family  life
      outside the UK.  As a consequence, Judge  Deavin  was  satisfied  that
      section EX.1 of Appendix FM applied and he allowed  the  appeal  under
      the Immigration Rules.

   5. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on the  basis  that
      the appellant could not show that she met the requirements of Appendix
      FM even if section EX.1 applied.  That  was  because  the  eligibility
      requirement in E-LTRP 2.1(a) was that:

           "[t]he applicant must not be in the UK -

                 (a) as a visitor; ...."

   6. Section EX.1  did  not  absolve  the  appellant  from  satisfying  the
      requirement in E-LTRP 2.1(a) although it did mean that  the  appellant
      did not have to meet the financial requirements in Appendix FM.

   7. On 6 March 2014, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Cruthers) granted  the
      Secretary of State permission to appeal on the basis that that  ground
      was arguable citing Sabir  (Appendix  FM  -  EX.1  Not  Free-standing)
      Pakistan  [2014]  UKUT  0063  (IAC).   At  para  4  of  his  grant  of
      permission, Judge Cruthers also commented that:

           "At  least  on  the  face  of  the  facts  summarised   in   the
           determination under consideration,  one  might  think  that  the
           appellant has a strong case for  leave  to  remain  on  'classic
           Article 8 law principles', ie the law relating to Article  8  of
           the European Convention on Human Rights which  goes  beyond  the
           'Article 8 Immigration Rules'."

   8. Thus, the appeal came before me on 15 May 2014.

   9. The appellant is not legally represented and she did not appear at the
      hearing.  Notice of the date and time of the hearing was sent  to  the
      appellant's address on the file (which was confirmed by Mr Richards as
      being that held by the Secretary of State) on 14 April 2014.   In  the
      absence of any explanation for the appellant's absence,  I  considered
      it to be in the interests of justice to proceed with  the  hearing  in
      the absence of the appellant exercising my discretion under rule 38 of
      the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2698).

The Submissions

  10. On behalf of the Secretary of State, Mr Richards  handed  up  a  small
      bundle of documents under cover of a letter from a firm of  solicitors
      which whilst not acting in the appeal  stated  that  they  dealt  with
      other matters for Stephen Heaven and had been requested to forward the
      documents to the respondent.  Those documents showed that on  9  April
      2014, the appellant gave birth to a son in  hospital  at  Aberystwyth.
      Stephen Heaven is named as the father on the  birth  certificate.   Mr
      Richards reminded me that at the date of Judge Deavin's decision,  the
      appellant had been pregnant.

  11. Mr Richards made two submissions.  First, he submitted that the  Judge
      had made a clear error in allowing the appeal  under  the  Immigration
      Rules on the basis of section EX.1.  The appellant could  not  succeed
      under Appendix FM if she was in the UK as a visitor.  On  that  basis,
      he invited me to dismiss  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
      Secondly, however, Mr  Richards  drew  my  attention  to  the  factual
      situation of the sponsor set out in Judge Deavin's determination  and,
      in particular, his health condition resulting from two  heart  attacks
      and a serious motor accident that had occurred in September 2012 which
      had caused him to no longer to be  able  to  work  as  a  construction
      manager/overseas and had  required  him  to  return  to  the  UK.   Mr
      Richards indicated that he was content for me to remake  the  decision
      in relation to Article 8 of the  ECHR.   He  invited  me  to  consider
      whether there were compelling circumstances such that the  appellant's
      removal would be disproportionate under Article 8 outside  the  Rules.



Error of Law

  12. The requirements for being  granted  limited  leave  to  remain  as  a
      partner are set out in section R-LTRP  in  Appendix  FM.   So  far  as
      relevant, R-LTRP 1.1 provides as follows:

           "Section R-LTRP: Requirements for limited leave to remain  as  a
           partner

            "LTRP.1.1. The requirements to be  met  for  limited  leave  to
              remain as a partner are-

           (a)  the applicant and their partner must be in the UK.;

           (b)  the applicant  must  have  made  a  valid  application  for
              limited or indefinite leave  to  remain  as  a  partner;  and
              either

           (c)  (i)    the  applicant  must  not  fall  for  refusal  under
                 Section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

              (ii)     the applicant meets all the requirements of  Section
                 E-LTRP

                 Eligibility for leave to remain as a partner; or

           (d)   (i)   the  applicant  must  not  fall  for  refusal  under
                 Section S-LTR: Suitability leave to remain; and

              (ii)     the applicant meets the requirements of paragraphs E-
                 LTRP 1.2-1.12and E-LTRP 2.1; and

              (iii)    paragraph EX.1 applies."

  13. The appellant clearly met R-LTRP 1.1(a)  and  (b).   In  addition,  in
      order to succeed the appellant was required to either  satisfy  R-LTRP
      1.1(c) or R-LTRP 1.1(d).  R-LTRP 1.1(c) requires, inter alia, that the
      appellant meet all the requirements of section E-LTRP.  R-LTRP  1.1(d)
      on the other hand, required the appellant only to establish (so far as
      the relevant for the purposes of this appeal)  paras  E-LTRP  1.2-1.12
      and E-LTRP 2.1 providing that also section EX.1 applies.

  14. Importantly,  both  R-LTRP  1.1(c)  and  R-LTRP  1.1(d)  required  the
      appellant to meet the requirements  of  E-LTRP  2.1.   That  provision
      relates to the individual's immigration status and is in the following
      terms:

           " Immigration Status Requirements

           E-LTRP.2.1 The applicant must not be in the UK -

           (a)   as a visitor

           (b)   with valid leave granted for a period of 6 months of less,
                 unless that leave is  as  a  fianc�(e)  or  proposed  civil
                 partner, or was granted pending the outcome of family court
                 or divorce proceedings; or

           (c)   on  temporary  admission  or  temporary  release  (*unless
                 paragraph EX.1 applies).

           E-LTRP.2.2. The applicant must not be in the  UK  in  breach  of
           immigration laws (disregarding any period of overstaying  for  a
           period of 28 days or less), unless paragraph EX.1 applies."

  15. In order to succeed under either R-LTRP 1.1(c ) or R-LTRP  1.1(d),  E-
      LTRP 2.1(a) required that the appellant should not be in the UK " as a
      visitor".  However, that was precisely her immigration status  in  the
      UK when she made her application for further leave as a spouse.  As  a
      consequence, she could not succeed in meeting the  requirement  in  R-
      LTRP 1.1(c) or R-LTRP1.1 (d) even if in the latter case  section  EX.1
      applied.  Section EX.1, again so far as relevant states that:

           "Section EX: Exception

           EX.1  This paragraph applies if ....

                    (b)      the applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
                       relationship with a partner who is in the UK and is a
                       British  citizen...and   there   are   insurmountable
                       obstacles to family life for that partner  continuing
                       outside the UK."

  16. Judge Deavin found in the appellant's favour on the substantive issues
      in section EX.1, namely that her relationship with the sponsor  was  a
      genuine and subsisting one; he was a British citizen  and  that  there
      were insurmountable obstacles to their family life continuing  outside
      the UK.  Nevertheless, as the  Upper  Tribunal  recognised  in  Sabir,
      section EX.1 is not 'free-standing'. The appellant had also to satisfy
      the requirement in E-LTRP 2.1(a) which she could not.

  17. Thus, the appellant could not establish that she met the  requirements
      of Appendix FM and was entitled to further  leave  as  a  spouse.   In
      finding that she did meet those requirements, Judge  Deavin  erred  in
      law.  His decision cannot stand.  I set it aside.   There is no  other
      basis  upon  which  the  appellant  could  have  succeeded  under  the
      Immigration Rules at the time of Judge Deavin's  decision.   I  remake
      that part of his decision dismissing the appellant's appeal under  the
      Immigration Rules.

Re-making the decision

  18. Mr Richards invited me to remake the decision under Article 8  of  the
      ECHR.  He accepted that there was family life  between  the  appellant
      and sponsor.  He invited me to consider whether there were  compelling
      circumstances which made the appellant's removal  unjustifiably  harsh
      such that her removal would be disproportionate.

  19. The relevant evidence is  set  out  in  Judge  Deavin's  determination
      beginning at para 10.  The sponsor worked in Singapore and Malaysia as
      an oil rig construction manager  earning  approximately  $200,000  per
      annum.  The sponsor met the appellant in September 2008  in  Singapore
      where  he  was  working  and  the  appellant  was  a  student.   Their
      relationship developed and they lived together  for  extended  periods
      prior to their marriage.

  20. In March 2012, the sponsor suffered two heart attacks and was admitted
      to hospital in Thailand.   In  September  2012,  he  suffered  serious
      injury in a motor accident and had one eye removed.   On  25  November
      2012, the sponsor returned to the UK as his cardiac condition and  the
      injuries he had sustained in the  accident  meant  that  he  could  no
      longer continue to work as a construction manager.   He  was  severely
      incapacitated following the accident and lives with his 77  years  old
      father.

  21. On 23 December 2012, the appellant entered the UK with entry clearance
      as a visitor giving her valid leave until 12 June 2013.  The appellant
      and sponsor married in the UK on 29 April 2013.  They  lived  together
      in the home of the sponsor's father in north Wales.

  22. The Judge dealt with the  evidence  concerning  the  sponsor's  health
      conditions and the impact that that might have on his ability to  live
      abroad at paras 19-20, 22, 24 and 27-28 as follows:

           "19.  The Sponsor's GP is concerned about his medical  condition
                 and has referred  him  to  a  consultant  neurologist.   He
                 collapsed and blacked out recently without  warning,  which
                 caused him to suffer further injury.   His  GP  fears  some
                 sort of neurological problem may have been sustained during
                 the motor accident.  His  GP  considers  that  he  requires
                 twenty four hour care.

             20. The Sponsor's father alone is not strong enough to  provide
                 him with such care and his son cannot provide  care  as  he
                 spends extended periods at work and shares a  flat  with  a
                 friend in Birmingham.  The only person able to provide  him
                 with the required care currently is his wife.

                 ... .

             22. To refuse the application will cause a great deal of  undue
                 stress to the Appellant, as she will be required  to  leave
                 her spouse and return to Vietnam.  She wishes to settle  in
                 the United Kingdom on a permanent basis  with  her  spouse.
                 The Appellant has established her own family  unit  in  the
                 United Kingdom with her spouse and they  wish  to  continue
                 their subsisting relationship and family  life  on  a  more
                 permanent basis together in the United Kingdom.

                 ....

             24. Her husband does not want to live abroad  anymore  as  they
                 felt that medical treatment is better in the United Kingdom
                 and she wants to remain with him to  care  for  him.   They
                 have now been together for five years.  His father is  aged
                 seventy seven and not able to care for him  properly.   She
                 was asked if she had ever been refused a  visa  before  and
                 said she was refused  on  the  first  application,  as  the
                 British Embassy in Hanoi wanted them to show they had  been
                 in a relationship  since  2008.   Her  husband  had  emails
                 dating back to then and photographs and the  Embassy  could
                 see that they had visited several Asian countries together.
                  When she reapplied, she was granted six months...

                 ...

             27. In a covering letter, the Sponsor says that he cannot  live
                 in Vietnam because of his medical conditions.

             28. Additionally, he says that the Appellant visited the doctor
                 in August and has now been told that she is  pregnant  with
                 their child."

  23. As regards the appellant's pregnancy, as I have already  indicated  Mr
      Richards provided me with a birth certificate relating to the  son  of
      the appellant and sponsor who was born on 9 April 2014.

  24. In relation to the Immigration Rules, Judge Deavin made  a  number  of
      findings at paragraphs 37-45.  Relevant to my decision  under  Article
      8, he found, as the respondent had accepted and  Mr  Richards  did  so
      before  me,  that  the  parties'  relationship  was  a  "genuine   and
      subsisting" one.  At para 40, the Judge  noted  the  evidence  of  the
      appellant and sponsor  that  because  of  the  sponsor's  "substantial
      medical problems" it would not be possible for them to move away  from
      the UK and live in Vietnam.  At paragraph 42, he referred to a  letter
      from the sponsor's GP which set out that the sponsor had suffered  two
      major heart attacks before moving back to the UK  following  his  road
      accident and that he "is in need of support and care".   At  paragraph
      43, the Judge found:

           "It is on that evidence that I am satisfied that  any  suggested
           removal to Vietnam  for  the  Sponsor  would  give  rise  to  an
           insurmountable  obstacle  on  account  of  his  current  medical
           problems."

  25. In applying Article 8 of the ECHR, the five stage test set out by Lord
      Bingham of Cornhill in Razgar [2004] UKHL  27  at  [17]  requires  the
      following questions to be answered:

           "(i)  Will the proposed removal be an interference by  a  public
                 authority with the exercise of  the  applicant's  right  to
                 respect for his private or (as the case maybe) family life?

           (ii)  If so, will such interference have  consequences  of  such
                 gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Art 8?

            iii) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?

             iv) If so, is  such  interference  necessary  in  a  democratic
                 society in the interest of national security, public safety
                 or  the  economic  well-being  of  the  country,  for   the
                 prevention of disorder or  crime,  for  the  protection  of
                 health or morals, or for the protection of the  rights  and
                 freedoms of others?

              v) If so, is such interference proportionate to the legitimate
                 public aims sought to be achieved?"

  26. At [20] Lord Bingham stated that question 5:

           "...must always involve the striking of a fair  balance  between
           the rights of the individual and the interest of  the  community
           which is inherent in the whole of the convention.  The  severity
           and consequences of the interference will  call  for  a  careful
           assessment at this stage."

  27.  As  I  have  already  indicated,  Judge  Deavins  accepted   that   a
      relationship with the sponsor was a genuine and subsisting one.   They
      have known each other since September  2008  and  have  cohabited  for
      extended periods prior to their marriage which took place on 29  April
      2013.  Since the appellant came to the UK in December  2012,  she  has
      lived together with the sponsor in his father's home in north Wales.

  28. I have set out the evidence concerning the sponsor's health conditions
      and I am in no doubt that it would not be reasonable to expect him  to
      leave the UK to live with the sponsor as  her  husband  elsewhere,  in
      particular, Vietnam.  That mirrors Judge Deavin's  finding  (which  is
      not challenged) that there was an "insurmountable obstacle on  account
      of [the sponsor's] current medical problems"  in  the  parties  living
      abroad.

  29. For those reasons, I am satisfied that Article 8.1 is  engaged:  there
      is family life which will be sufficiently seriously interfered with if
      the appellant is not permitted to remain in the UK.

  30. As regards Art 8.2, the appellant does not meet  the  requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules, in particular Appendix FM and consequently  the
      decision is in accordance with the law.  The  interference  is  for  a
      legitimate aim, namely the economic well-being of the  country.    The
      crucial issue is, as Mr Richard accepted before me, in question (5) of
      Lord Bingham's speech in Razgar at [17], namely whether  the   removal
      of the appellant would be proportionate.

  31. As I have said, the appellant does not meet the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules.  It is clear from the case law which has  developed
      since the new "Article 8 rules" came into effect on 9 July  2012  that
      it will only be where there are "compelling" circumstances  such  that
      unjustifiably harsh consequences will result from the decision that an
      individual who cannot meet the requirements  of  the  new  rules  may,
      nevertheless, establish that the decision  is  disproportionate  under
      Article 8 (see MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 1192; R  (Nagre)  v
      SSHD [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin) and Gulshan (Article  8  -  New  Rules  -
      Correct Approach) [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)).

  32. In my judgement, there are a number of features of this  appeal  which
      do give rise  to  compelling  circumstances  and  unjustifiably  harsh
      consequences such that the public  interest  is  out  weighed  by  the
      rights of the appellant and her partner to respect  for  their  family
      life.

  33. First, and foremost, there is the sponsor's medical condition.   Judge
      Deavin accepted that it was a serious condition and I  entirely  agree
      with that assessment.  The sponsor  has  suffered  two  serious  heart
      attacks and a serious road traffic injury which resulted in him losing
      an eye.  The evidence from his GP is that the  sponsor  has  collapsed
      and blacked out recently without warning and  the  GP  considers  that
      there maybe some sort of  neurological  problem  which  was  sustained
      during the road accident.   The GP considers that the sponsor requires
      24 hour care and, in practical terms, that is provided  by  his  wife,
      the appellant.  The sponsor's father is 77 years of age  and  not,  in
      practical terms, able to provide that care and the  sponsor's  son  is
      unable to do so due to  his  work  and  the  fact  that  he  lives  in
      Birmingham.

  34. I take into account that when the appellant came to the UK she had  no
      expectation of being allowed to remain beyond the maximum  six  months
      of her visit visa.  She and the sponsor married in full  knowledge  of
      that limitation.  However, the appellant is lawfully  in  the  UK  and
      there is no suggestion that her residence  has  ever  been  otherwise.
      She has a long standing relationship with the sponsor dating  back  to
      September 2008 even though their marriage is relatively recent  having
      been celebrated on 29 April 2013.   At  the  date  of  Judge  Deavin's
      decision the appellant was pregnant and it is now the  case  that  the
      appellant has given birth to a  son  and,  as  the  birth  certificate
      shows, the sponsor is the father.  As a consequence  of  his  father's
      nationality, that child is a British citizen.

  35.  It  is  also  the  case  that  the  appellant  met  the   substantive
      requirements of Appendix FM; she only failed on  the  basis  that  she
      could not obtain the leave by switching from leave as a visitor. In my
      judgement, it would place  a  procedural  requirement  (and  therefore
      form) over the substance of the appellant's claim if she were required
      to return to Vietnam and seek entry clearance (Chikwamba v SSHD [2008]
      UKHL 40 and SSHD v Treebhowan and Hayat [2012] EWCA  Civ  10).   Given
      the obvious dependence of the sponsor upon her because of his  medical
      condition, it would  be  wholly  unreasonably,  in  my  judgement,  to
      require her to leave him (even on a temporary  basis)  to  seek  entry
      clearance.  She does, of course, also now have a young son (just  over
      1 year old) which would add to the difficulties of doing so.

  36. I accept, as did Judge Deavin, that there are insurmountable obstacles
      to the appellant and sponsor continuing their family life outside  the
      UK.  Given his health condition, it would not be reasonable to  expect
      him to leave the UK and live abroad.  I also take into account,  as  I
      am entitled to under  s.85(4)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002 a matter arising since the date of decision  which  is
      relevant to the substance of the decision, namely  the  birth  of  the
      parties' child in the UK and who is a British citizen. That fact  only
      seeks to emphasise, in my judgement, the unreasonableness of expecting
      the appellant to return to Vietnam not just to  seek  entry  clearance
      but also to counter any suggestion that the parties should relocate to
      Vietnam to carry on their married life.

  37. For these reasons, therefore, I am satisfied that there are compelling
      circumstances such that there will be unjustifiably harsh consequences
      if the appellant is not granted leave to remain in the UK.   Balancing
      the public interest against the Article 8 rights of the appellant  and
      sponsor,  I  am  satisfied  that  the  appellant's  removal   (whether
      temporarily or permanently) would be a  disproportionate  interference
      with the right to respect for her and the sponsor's family life in the
      UK.

  38. For these reasons, the appellant's removal would breach Article  8  of
      the ECHR and I allow her appeal on that basis.

Decision

  39. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  allow  the  appellant's
      appeal under the Immigration Rules involved the making of an error  of
      law.  That decision cannot stand and I set it aside.

  40. I re-make the decision dismissing the  appellant's  appeal  under  the
      Immigration Rules but I allow the appeal under Article 8 of the  ECHR.
