For the Appellant:     Mr Z Malik, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr G Saunders, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

Details of appellant and basis of claim

   1.       This appeal comes before me following the grant of permission on
      11 November 2013 by First-tier Tribunal Judge Cheales  in  respect  of
      the determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge Walters  who  dismissed
      the appeal of the  lead  appellant  and  her  dependants  following  a
      hearing at Taylor House on 12 September 2013 by way of a determination
      promulgated on 18 October 2012.

   2.       The lead appellant is the wife of the second and the  mother  of
      the third and fourth twin appellants and they are all citizens of  Sri
      Lanka born on 24 March 1970,  12  October  1968  and  2  October  2008
      respectively. On 28 March 2013 the respondent refused to  grant  leave
      to remain to the first appellant and her dependants under the  Tier  1
      provisions. This was because the appellant had failed to establish all
      her previous earnings; in particular, because the  payslips  and  bank
      deposits showing her salary from Moonstone Restaurant and  Bistro  did
      not tally with one another. Points  were,  however,  awarded  for  her
      employment with EDF.

   3.       The appellant appealed and argued that her  employers  had  made
      mistakes which accounted for the discrepancies  between  some  of  the
      payslips and the cheques that had been issued to her and paid into her
      account. One discrepancy was caused by the payment of a  separate  ï¿½50
      cheque from a friend into her account along with  her  salary  cheque.
      The judge took this explanation into account and  was  satisfied  that
      the salary was as claimed. However, he found that this explanation had
      not been provided to the Secretary of State and nor had the additional
      documentary evidence which was adduced in support of  the  appeal.  He
      found that in those circumstances, the evidence could  not  be  relied
      upon to find that the respondent had acted incorrectly in refusing the
      application. Accordingly he dismissed the appeal.

Appeal hearing

   4.       At the hearing I  heard  submissions  from  the  parties  as  to
      whether the judge made errors of law.

   5.       Mr Malik submitted that the requirements of the rules  had  been
      met in that in accordance with paragraphs 19(a)  and  19  -  SD(a)  of
      Appendix A, the appellant had submitted her payslips and personal bank
      statements. That was what the rules required of her and that had  been
      done. There had been some discrepancies but these had been resolved at
      the hearing. The Tribunal should therefore have  allowed  the  appeal.
      His second submission was that the judge  had  erred  in  refusing  to
      allow the appeal on the basis of the fresh  documentary  evidence.  He
      submitted that the letter from the appellant's employer (at page 24 of
      the bundle) had been before the Secretary of State before the decision
      was made although he could show no evidence to confirm  that  or  that
      the judge had been told that was the case. Whilst he argued  that  the
      Secretary of State had written to the appellant  to  ask  for  further
      evidence, he conceded that a copy of that letter had not been included
      in the bundle and it appeared that it had  not  been  brought  to  the
      attention of the judge. He submitted that  regardless  of  that  fact,
      however, the letter from the employer was in the bundle and the  judge
      had not made any finding on it. Further, s. 85A (4)(c) provided for an
      exception to the  rule  of  refusing  to  admit  documentary  evidence
      submitted after the application.  It allowed  for  the  acceptance  of
      evidence "adduced to prove that a document is genuine or  valid".  The
      documents submitted to the Tribunal were to show that  the  pay  slips
      and bank statements submitted with the application  were  genuine  and
      valid and so the judge had been wrong to exclude them.

   6.       For the respondent, Mr Saunders argued that the  judge  had  not
      made errors. It had been open to him to accept that the appellant  had
      made out her case at the hearing but had not done so when she made her
      application. He had therefore been right not to allow the appeal.  The
      exception did not apply as the respondent  had  not  argued  that  the
      appellant's documents were invalid or not genuine.

   7.       In response Mr Malik submitted that the appellant  had  provided
      the evidence required of her and once the  judge  found  there  was  a
      match between the payslips and her salary, he should have allowed  the
      appeal.

   8.       At the conclusion of the hearing  I  reserved  my  determination
      which I now give.

Findings and Conclusions

   9.       I have carefully considered all the submissions and the evidence
      before arriving at my conclusions.

  10.        It has to be said that the grant  of  permission  makes  little
      sense. It states that as the judge found that there  was  no  mismatch
      between the payslips and bank statements, he  should  have  considered
      and given weight  to  the  appellant's  explanation  as  to  how  this
      disparity had occurred. It is plain from the  determination,  however,
      that the judge did indeed consider the explanation. If he had not done
      so, he would now have reached the conclusion that there was in  effect
      no conflict between the salary and the bank deposits  or  rather  than
      the apparent disparity had been resolved. The judge's  difficulty  was
      that this information and the subsequent documentary evidence, arising
      after the  date  of  the  decision,  had  not  been  supplied  to  the
      respondent with the application. As such, he found that the respondent
      could not be expected  to  know  that  the  appellant  had  banked  an
      additional cheque with her salary cheque on one occasion or  that  her
      employers accounting was so bad that they made  repeated  mistakes  on
      other occasions. His reasoning was that as there had been a  conflict,
      the appellant should have sought to clarify the reason when  she  made
      her application, not later after the refusal.
  11.       With respect, having considered the arguments made,  I  find  no
      merit in Mr Malik's submission that the letter  from  the  appellant's
      employers had been forwarded to the Secretary of State  prior  to  the
      decision. There is no evidence that was done and such a submission was
      not made to  the  judge.  Additionally,  the  fact  that  he  did  not
      specifically make a finding on this letter  does  not  assist  in  the
      appellant's challenge as it would have done no more than reinforce the
      finding he already made about her salary. She has not  therefore  been
      disadvantaged by a lack of finding in this respect.

  12.       Mr Malik's last submission  was,  in  my  view,  his  strongest.
      Section 85A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  sets
      out matters to be considered on appeal; i.e. fresh evidence.  It  also
      sets out exceptions. Section 85A(4)(c) allows the Tribunal to consider
      evidence adduced by the appellant if it is adduced  to  prove  that  a
      document is genuine or valid. The argument is that  her  evidence  was
      designed to support the documents she supplied with  her  application;
      that is to say, to support her claimed salary.  I  note  Mr  Saunders'
      resistance to that submission on the basis  that  the  respondent  had
      never maintained that the appellant's  documents  were  not  valid  or
      genuine but surely the inference of the rejection of the  evidence  of
      the appellant's salary was that something was amiss in respect of  the
      evidence supplied. In that sense the respondent was  indeed  rejecting
      the reliability of the evidence.

  13.       The appellant's subsequent evidence, both documentary  and  oral
      (the latter not being precluded from 85A(4)(c) focused  on  clarifying
      the conflict in the earlier documentary evidence and  in  establishing
      that the appellant did indeed earn the salary claimed. The documentary
      evidence from her employer established  that  and  her  oral  evidence
      explained the anomalies between some of the bank deposits and the  pay
      slips. The judge could and should have taken  al  this  evidence  into
      account when deciding whether the appeal could be allowed. I accept he
      took account of it at the hearing and indeed found that it established
      that the rules had been met, but he stopped too soon. He  should  have
      gone on further and found that it was covered by the  exception  cited
      above and that the appeal therefore succeeded.

  14.       It was not argued by Mr Saunders that because the issue over the
      exception was not argued before the judge, it could not now be raised.
      Indeed, it would be difficult to see how he could  have  made  such  a
      submission. The exception is part  of  statutory  law  and  the  judge
      should have had it in mind when he considered section 85A.  It follows
      that the judge made an error of law in refusing to consider the  fresh
      evidence for the purposes of allowing the appeal. Both parties were in
      agreement that if an error of law was found, it followed that I  would
      remake the decision and allow the appeal. That I do.



Decision

  15.       The First-tier Tribunal made an  error  of  law  such  that  the
      decision is set aside. I remake the decision and allow the appeals  on
      immigration grounds.
