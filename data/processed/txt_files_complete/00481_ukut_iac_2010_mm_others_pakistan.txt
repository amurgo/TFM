Judicial decision-makers should be careful to identify and reject  arguments
based on an alleged near-miss, which, on proper analysis, are an attempt  to
import extraneous qualifications into the immigration rules. The  Article  8
proportionality balancing exercise is unlikely to be properly  conducted  if
the judge has, in effect, substituted his or her own view of what the  rules
should say.

The requirement in paragraph  116  of  Appendix  A  to  the  rules,  that  a
Confirmation for Acceptance of Studies  must  be  issued  not  more  than  6
months before the application for leave is made, is  not  met  by  a  letter
issued after the application has been made.



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The Secretary of State appeals, with permission granted by the  First-
    tier Tribunal, against the determination of Immigration Judge Duff who,
    following a hearing at North Shields  on  30  June  2010,  allowed  the
    appeals of the respondents against the Secretary of  State's  decisions
    to refuse to vary their leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

2.    The respondents are nationals of Pakistan,  born  respectively  on  20
    July 1979 and 18 October 1978.  The  first  respondent  applied  for  a
    variation of her leave as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant under  the
    points-based system of the Immigration Rules.   The  second  respondent
    applied as the dependant of the first respondent.  It was and is common
    ground that the appeal of the second respondent is  entirely  dependent
    upon that of the first respondent.

3.    The relevant provisions of the Immigration Rules are as follows:-

         "245ZX   Requirements for leave to remain




            To qualify for leave to remain as a  Tier  4  (General)  Student
                under this Rule, an applicant  must  meet  the  requirements
                listed below.  If the applicant  meets  these  requirements,
                leave to remain will be granted.  If the applicant does  not
                meet these requirements, the applicant will be refused.


            Requirements:


                ...


                (b)    the applicant must have or have  last  been  granted,
                    entry clearance, leave to enter or leave to remain:


                    (i)      as a Tier 4 (General) Student,


                    ...


                (c)    the applicant must have a minimum of 30 points  under
                    paragraphs 113 to 120 of Appendix A,


                ...




         Appendix A


         Attributes for Tier 4 (General) Students


         113.     An applicant applying for  entry  clearance  or  leave  to
                remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student must  score  30  points
                for attributes.


         114.     Available points are shown in Table 16 below.


         115.     Notes to accompany Table 16 appear below that table.




         Table 16




         |Criterion                                      |Points awarded     |
|                                               |                   |
|Confirmation of acceptance for studies         |30                 |
|                                               |                   |






         Notes




         116.     A Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies  will  only  be
                considered to be valid if:


                (a)    it was issued  no  more  than  6  months  before  the
                    application is made,


                (b)    the application  for  entry  clearance  or  leave  to
                    remain is made no more than 3 months  before  the  start
                    date  of  the  course  of  study  as   stated   on   the
                    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies,


                ...


                (d)    it was  issued  by  an  institution  with  a  Tier  4
                    (General) Student Sponsor Licence,


                (e)    the institution must still hold such a licence at the
                    time the application for entry  clearance  or  leave  to
                    remain is determined,


                ..."

4.    The first respondent wished to vary her leave to remain  in  order  to
    study for an Advanced Diploma in  Business  Management  at  the  London
    School of Business and Computing in London, N1.  The course was due  to
    begin on 12 October 2009.  The Confirmation of Acceptance  for  Studies
    comprised a letter dated 30 September 2009 from LSBC.

5.     The  Secretary  of  State's  decision  in  respect   of   the   first
    respondent's refusal is  dated  15  March  2010.   For  the  30  points
    required for attributes in relation to the Confirmation  of  Acceptance
    for Studies, the appellant was awarded no points.  The letter explained
    as follows:-

         "The Tier 4 Sponsor Register was  checked  on  02  March  2010  but
         London School of Business and Computing, Business Design Center, 52
         Upper Street, Islington, London, N1 0QH was not listed as  of  this
         date.  In view of  these  facts  the  Secretary  of  State  is  not
         satisfied that you have a valid visa letter."

6.    The Immigration Judge's reasoning is set out at paragraphs 2 to  7  of
    his determination:-

         "2.      The burden of proving the case lies upon the appellant and
             the standard of proof is  on  the  balance  of  probabilities.
             Pursuant to section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration  and
             Asylum Act 2002 I may  consider  evidence  about  any  matter,
             which I consider relevant to the substance  of  the  decision,
             including evidence which concerns matters  arising  since  the
             date of the Respondent's decision, but the appellant  must  be
             able to demonstrate that she qualified as at the date  of  her
             application, which was on 27 November 2009.


         3. I state the above as it is crucial to the decision in this case.
              At the beginning of the hearing I raised that matter with  Ms
             Cornford [the Presenting Officer] who suggested that - because
             this is an in-country appeal - the appropriate  date  for  the
             appellant to demonstrate that she satisfied  the  requirements
             was at the date of the hearing.   I  made  it  clear  that  my
             understanding of the matter was that the relevant date was the
             date of the application and that  I  proposed  to  decide  the
             matter on that basis and - if I was incorrect - then it  would
             be open to the Respondent [the Secretary of State] to have  my
             decision reviewed.


         4. I am fortified in my view of the matter by the decision in  SSHD
             v  Pankina  and  Others  [2010]  EWCA  Civ  718  in  which  at
             paragraphs 37 & 38 under the heading 'The date  at  which  the
             facts are to be tested' Lord Justice Sedley states that  -  in
             that case - compliance is to be judged as at the date  of  the
             application.  Although that case  was  concerned  with  funds,
             nonetheless it accords  with  the  only  commonsense  approach
             that, as it is to the  Home  Office  a  proof  of  having  the
             appropriate points is to be submitted that it can only  be  at
             the time of the submission of that  proof  i.e.  the  date  of
             application.


         5. On that basis it is clear that the  reasoning  set  out  in  the
             refusal letter of 15 March 2010 is flawed  since  that  letter
             makes it clear that the application was made  on  27  November
             2009 but then goes  on  to  state  that  the  Tier  4  Sponsor
             Register was checked on 2 March 2010 but the London School  of
             Business and Computing (from whom the appellant had  submitted
             a visa letter) was not - at that date -  listed.   The  proper
             test to be applied was  whether  -  as  at  the  date  of  the
             application - the college was on the Tier 4 Sponsor Register.


         6. Neither Ms Cornford nor the appellant was able to produce a copy
             of the register as at the date  of  the  application  but  the
             appellant gave evidence that it appeared on  the  register  on
             the Respondent's website at that time and Ms Cornford did  not
             contend that it did not.  The appellant  stated  that  it  had
             been suspended at the end of January and then removed from the
             list.


         7. Since it is perfectly clear from the documentation that as  soon
             as soon as the college was removed from the list the appellant
             took active steps  to  find  another  qualifying  college  and
             communicated with the Respondent that she was doing so,  I  am
             satisfied that it was indeed on that list at the time  of  the
             application.


         8. The Respondent awarded the appellant the necessary points  under
             the heading of Maintenance and it was on the sole  basis  that
             the college had been removed that she was not awarded  the  30
             points for the visa letter.  The true position was that, as at
             the date of the application, the college that had supplied the
             visa letter was on the list of approved institutions  and  the
             Respondent ought to have awarded 30 points accordingly."

7.    The Immigration Judge's  reasoning  in  these  paragraphs  is  plainly
    wrong and Ms Iqbal, for the respondents, did not seek to persuade us to
    the contrary.  The Immigration Judge has misunderstood the judgment  in
    Pankina.  The effect of that judgment is not such that,  as  a  general
    matter, compliance with the Immigration Rules  is  to  be  assessed  by
    reference to the date of application.  The essence of Pankina  is  that
    the Secretary of State may not impose requirements by means of guidance
    that does not form part  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  lie  outside
    Parliament's scrutiny.  In Pankina the  purported  requirement  in  the
    guidance required applicants to have at least �800 of personal  savings
    for at least three months prior to the  date  of  application.   Absent
    that guidance, the only meaningful way of construing paragraph 245Z and
    paragraph 2 of Appendix C was that those provisions required  the  �800
    savings to be held at the time of the application (paragraph 37).

8.    In the present case, the provision upon which the Secretary  of  State
    relied, and with which she asserted  the  first  respondent  could  not
    comply, was paragraph 116(e) of Appendix A to  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Appendix A is part of the Immigration Rules, as  required  to  be  laid
    before Parliament in accordance with  the  procedure  set  out  in  the
    Immigration Act 1971.  It is in no sense to be equated with guidance of
    the kind with which Pankina was concerned.

9.     Paragraph  116(e)  requires   the   institution   that   issued   the
    Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (or "visa letter") still to hold
    the requisite licence "at the time the application for entry  clearance
    or leave to remain is determined" (our emphasis).

10.   There is  nothing  in  paragraph  38  of  Pankina  that  supports  the
    approach of  the  Immigration  Judge  in  the  present  case.   On  the
    contrary, paragraphs 38 and 39 (which need to  be  read  together)  are
    obiter dicta laying to rest the mistaken argument, which had frequently
    been run, that section 85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 means everything is to be  decided  as  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing  before  the  Immigration  Judge,  irrespective  of  what   the
    Immigration Rules actually say.  The true position is that, if  a  Rule
    specifically requires a particular state of affairs  to  pertain  at  a
    particular point in time, then that  is  what  needs  to  be  shown  by
    evidence, albeit that  that  might  include  "evidence  which  concerns
    matters arising since the date of the decision":-

         "38.     If,  contrary  to  my  clear  view,  the  material  policy
             guidance forms part of the Appendix C criteria, question  2(a)
             asks at what date compliance is to be judged.  In the  present
             cases, this means the date  of  application  or  the  date  of
             appeal.  The  �800  in  the  bank  accounts  of  some  of  the
             applicants had not  been  there  continuously  for  the  three
             months preceding their applications but  had  been  there  for
             three continuous months by the time their appeals came up.


         39.      Although argument has been directed  to  large  issues  of
             principle arising out of the phraseology of  the  legislation,
             the answer has in my judgment to be found  in  the  provisions
             themselves.  The Rule as framed makes it clear that it  is  to
             the Home Office that the necessary proof  must  be  submitted.
             The argument that a fresh  opportunity  arises  on  appeal  is
             based on s.85(4) of the 2002 Act, which provides that on  such
             an appeal the tribunal 'may consider evidence about any matter
             which it thinks relevant to the  substance  of  the  decision,
             including evidence which concerns a matter arising  after  the
             date of the decision'.  There are many instances of Rule-based
             issues which need to be appraised as they stand at the  moment
             of the appeal hearing, but the question whether at the date of
             the  application  the  specified  funds  had   been   in   the
             applicant's bank account for three  continuous  months  cannot
             intelligibly be answered by evidence that they had not, albeit
             that they now have been."

11.   By the same token, section 85(4) cannot be  used  to  write  paragraph
    116(e) of Appendix A out of existence.

12.   For these reasons, the Upper Tribunal found on 17 November that  there
    was an error of law in the determination of the Immigration Judge, such
    as to  require  that  determination  to  be  set  aside.   Pursuant  to
    directions issued by the Tribunal on 13 October  2010,  we  accordingly
    proceeded to hear submissions regarding our re-making of  the  decision
    in the appeal.

13.   According  to  the  appellant,  after  the  LSBC  was  suspended,  the
    appellant sent an email to the Secretary of  State  on  19  March  2010
    asking for permission  to  obtain  a  Confirmation  of  Acceptance  for
    Studies letter from a new Tier 4 sponsor.  The email  was  acknowledged
    but nothing further was heard from the Secretary of State.  On 23 March
    2010 she obtained such a  letter  from  the  Overseas  Nurses  Training
    Organisation (ONTO), based in Leeds, in respect of an NVQ in Health and
    Social Care programme.  She started this course there on 19 April  2010
    with an end date of 23 April 2012.  A letter  dated  16  November  2010
    from ONTO states that the first respondent "is progressing well on  her
    course and is regularly attending planned sessions with her assessor".

14.   For the respondents, Ms Iqbal sought to  rely  on  relevant  guidance,
    which she said assisted her clients' case. As such the guidance fell to
    be construed as policies, which, if not followed, would mean  that  the
    Secretary of State's decision to refuse  to  vary  leave  "was  not  in
    accordance  with  the  law"  (section  86(3)(b)  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002).   The  guidance  to  be  used  for
    applications made on or after 5  October  2009,  so  far  as  relevant,
    provides as follows:-

         "Changes to the Tier 4 sponsor's licence


         8. There are certain circumstances where the status of the  Tier  4
             sponsor's licence may have an effect on a student and  his/her
             application.


         If the Tier 4 sponsor's licence is suspended


         If the Tier 4 sponsor's licence is suspended,  they  cannot  assign
         any new Confirmations of Acceptance for Studies or  issue  any  new
         visa letters.


         |Licence suspended              |What will happen                  |
|                               |                                  |
|If the student is already in   |If the student is already in the  |
|the United Kingdom studying    |United Kingdom and studying with a|
|                               |Tier 4 sponsor, we will not tell  |
|                               |him/her if we suspend their       |
|                               |licence.  However, if the result  |
|                               |of the suspension is that the Tier|
|                               |4 sponsor loses their licence, we |
|                               |will tell the student and his/her |
|                               |permission to stay will be        |
|                               |limited.                          |
|                               |                                  |
|If the student is extending    |A student can still apply to      |

|                               |if it runs out when the Tier 4    |
|                               |sponsor's licence is suspended, as|
|                               |long as he/she already has a      |
|                               |Confirmation of Acceptance for    |
|                               |Studies or a visa letter.         |
|                               |However, we will hold the         |
|                               |application until the suspension  |
|                               |is resolved."                     |


15.   In the present case it is common ground that  the  suspension  of  the
    LSBC was followed by  the  withdrawal  of  the  institution's  licence.
    Accordingly, the provisions of the guidance referred to by Ms Iqbal did
    not advance the first  respondent's  case,  a  matter  which  Ms  Iqbal
    appeared to acknowledge.

16.    Instead,  Ms  Iqbal  urged  the  Tribunal  to  concentrate  upon  the
    provisions in the guidance that  concerned  withdrawal  of  a  licence.
    According to the guidance for applications on or after 5 October  2009,
    in the case of withdrawal where a student  is  already  in  the  United
    Kingdom studying, the Secretary of  State  would  limit  the  student's
    permission to 60 days if the student was not involved  in  the  reasons
    why the Tier 4 sponsor had  had  their  licence  withdrawn;  otherwise,
    permission to stay would in effect be withdrawn with immediate  effect.
    The 60 day limitation would not, however, apply if the student had less
    than six months' leave left; but "the student may  want  to  apply  for
    permission to stay with another Tier 4 sponsor during this time".

17.   According to Ms Iqbal, for a reason we  will  come  to  shortly,  this
    leads on to a requirement  to  consider  the  guidance  in  respect  of
    applications made on or after 3 March 2010.  Here,  specific  provision
    was made in the case of withdrawal of the licence, where a student  has
    an application under consideration with the UK Border Agency.  In  such
    circumstances:-

         "If the Tier  4  sponsor's  licence  is  withdrawn,  the  student's
         Confirmation of Acceptance for  Studies  will  become  invalid  and
         his/her application will be refused.


         The student must either make a new Tier 4 application  with  a  new
         Tier 4 sponsor,  apply  for  permission  to  stay  in  a  different
         category, or leave the United Kingdom."

18.   It is clear from the guidance that the limitation to 60  days  is  not
    to be treated as an indication that the Secretary of State will, in the
    case of licence withdrawal, grant the student a further 60 days' leave.
    On the contrary, the guidance makes it plain that the 60 day period  is
    a restriction and that where a student has less than six months' leave,
    the remaining period will be left unaffected.  In the present case, the
    leave previously granted to the appellant had elapsed before  the  date
    of decision and was, accordingly, extended only to the extent permitted
    by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971.

19.   Ms Iqbal sought to rely on the last  set  of  guidance  on  the  basis
    that, according to the  first  respondent,  the  Secretary  of  State's
    decision of 15 March was not received  until  May.   The  Secretary  of
    State's records, however, showed that this arose from the Secretary  of
    State not being supplied with a current address of the respondents.  In
    any event, the matter does not materially affect the position  because,
    even if one accepted  Ms  Iqbal's  submission  that  the  guidance  for
    applications on and after 3 March 2010 had a part to play, the relevant
    provisions of that guidance to which we  have  just  referred  make  it
    plain that, where the licence is withdrawn,  the  student  must  either
    make a new Tier 4 application with a new Tier 4 sponsor  or  leave  the
    United Kingdom.

20.   The first respondent did neither of these  things.   The  email  query
    sent to the Secretary of State, concerning switching to study a nursing
    qualification with  ONTO,  cannot  be  said  to  constitute  a  Tier  4
    application.  The  first  respondent  knew  what  such  an  application
    entailed; she had, after all, already made one.  Ms Iqbal attempted  to
    rely on DC (Section 3C - meaning and effect) Ghana [2007] UKAIT  00043,
    although she did not provide  a  copy  of  this  determination  to  the
    Tribunal.[1]  On inspection, however, we find that it fails  to  assist
    the respondents.  That case held that it was not open to the  Secretary
    of State to treat an entirely new application as merely a variation  of
    an existing one, in the context of the prohibition on new  applications
    in section 3C(4) of the 1971 Act.  The case in no way can  be  held  to
    suggest that the action taken by  the  first  respondent  falls  to  be
    treated as a new Tier 4 application.

21.   However, even if it could, Ms Iqbal's submission runs  into  the  sand
    because the Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies issued  by  ONTO  in
    March 2010 cannot comply with paragraph 116 of Appendix A.  That letter
    was not issued "no more than 6 months before the application  is  made"
    (paragraph 116(a)).  The requirement that the  letter  must  be  issued
    "before" the application is inherent in paragraph 116(a). We find  that
    the respondents have failed to show that the decision appealed was  not
    in accordance with the law.

22.   The final part of Ms Iqbal's submissions related to paragraphs  41  to
    47 of Pankina and the interplay between  the  points-based  system  and
    Article 8 of the ECHR.  Ms Iqbal submitted that it was through no fault
    of the first respondent that the institution  at  which  she  had  been
    studying had had its licence withdrawn and that she had taken steps  to
    inform the Secretary of State of her decision to switch to the  nursing
    course in Leeds.  Ms Iqbal cited  CDS  (PBS:  "available":  Article  8)
    Brazil [2010] UKUT 00305 (IAC).  In that case, decided in the light  of
    and by reference to Pankina, the Tribunal found that, whilst Article  8
    did not give judicial fact-finders a  freestanding  liberty  to  depart
    from the Immigration Rules and it was unlikely that a person  would  be
    able to show an Article 8 right by coming to  the  United  Kingdom  for
    temporary purposes, nevertheless a person who was admitted to follow  a
    course that had not yet ended may have built up  a  private  life  that
    deserved respect and the public interest in removal before the  end  of
    the course might be reduced where there are ample  financial  resources
    available.

23.   Ms Iqbal also referred us to MB  (Article  8  -  near  miss)  Pakistan
    [2010] UKUT 282 (IAC),  where  Lord  Justice  Sedley,  sitting  in  the
    Tribunal said:-

         "5.      We have considered whether, notwithstanding  that  it  was
             not on her written agenda, the Immigration Judge ought to have
             dealt with [Article 8] as  what  one  could  call  a  Robinson
             point.  It is the case, as Mr Blundell very properly  for  the
             Home Office has pointed out to us, that this is a  door  which
             at least is arguably open by what has recently  been  said  by
             the Court of Appeal in the case of  Pankina  &  Others  [2010]
             EWCA Civ 719 from paragraphs 41 to 47.   Because  we  are  not
             required to determine this question, we do no more  than  note
             that it is at least respectably arguable that if an Article  8
             case is properly before a fact finding Tribunal or Tribunal of
             law in this  field,  one  of  the  matters  which  may  go  to
             proportionality is what is described by Ms Asanovic as a  near
             miss argument.  That is to say, if one is considering  on  the
             one hand the demands of a firm and  fair  immigration  control
             policy and on the other the situation of somebody whose family
             or private life is going to be disrupted in a material way  by
             removal for non-compliance with the Rules.  It may well matter
             what the nature and degree of non-compliance was.   We  go  no
             further down that road at present because it  does  not  arise
             materially in this case."

24.   For the Secretary of State, Mrs Sharland referred us to BN (Article  8
    - post study work) Kenya [2010] UKUT 162 (IAC), in which  the  Tribunal
    noted the "fact-sensitive" nature of what the Court of Appeal had found
    in  OA  (Nigeria)  [2008]  EWCA  Civ  82.   In  the  latter  case,  the
    appellant's private  life  was  found  to  require  protection  through
    Article 8, against removal from the United Kingdom in the middle of  an
    academic year.  Mrs Sharland submitted that the facts  of  the  present
    case were far removed from  those  in  OA  (Nigeria).   They  were,  in
    reality, closer to those considered by the Tribunal in MM (Tier 1  PSW;
    Art 8; "private life") Zimbabwe [2009] UKAIT 00037.

25.   We find that the  private  life  of  the  first  respondent  (and,  by
    extension, the second  respondent)  is  engaged  for  the  purposes  of
    providing a positive answer to the second of the five  questions  posed
    in paragraph 17 of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27. It is common ground that  the
    third and fourth questions also fall to be answered in the affirmative.
      The  issue  in  this  case  is,  accordingly,  whether  in  all   the
    circumstances it is proportionate to expect the  respondents  to  leave
    the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the effect that would have  on  the
    first respondent's studies.

26.   In the respondent's favour is, of course, the fact that, had the  LSBC
    not had its licence withdrawn, she might have expected successfully  to
    have  completed  her  Advanced  Diploma  in  Business  Management,  the
    teaching for which, we note, was due to end on 17  December  2010.   So
    far as her present course is concerned, we have described this  earlier
    in the determination but it is also worth setting out  paragraph  6  of
    the first respondent's statement of 21 October 2010:-

         "6.      I confirm that I started my course with ONTO on  19  April
             2010.  The end  date  of  course  is  23  April  2012.   I  am
             regularly attending the course since its start date.   I  have
             paid course fee partly, have invested time  in  attending  and
             studying  the  course  and   heavily   spending   amount   for
             maintenance.  It will be unfair and unjust if I am not allowed
             to complete my course."

27.   In deciding the proportionality issue, we have had regard to what  has
    recently been said in CDS and MB, in relation to the scope of what  may
    be described as a near-miss  argument,  post-Pankina,  in  points-based
    cases of this kind. It is important to emphasise the point made in  CDS
    that Article 8 is not to be viewed as a means whereby  the  immigration
    rules can be ignored or in effect re-written, because a judicial  fact-
    finder regards a person as having only narrowly failed to  comply  with
    the relevant rules. As the House of Lords held in Huang [2007] UKHL 11:-



              "There  will,  in  almost  any  case,  be   certain   general
          considerations  to  bear  in  mind:  the  general   administrative
          desirability of applying known rules if a  system  of  immigration
          control is to be workable, predictable,  consistent  and  fair  as
          between  one  applicant  and   another;   the   damage   to   good
          administration and effective control if a system is  perceived  by
          applicants internationally to be unduly porous,  unpredictable  or
          perfunctory; the need to discourage non-nationals admitted to  the
          country temporarily from believing that they  can  commit  serious
          crimes and yet be allowed to remain; the need to discourage fraud,
          deception  and  deliberate  breaches  of  the  law;  and  so   on"
          (paragraph 16).


28.    The first two of those considerations need to be firmly kept in  mind
    in considering a near-miss argument. In the present context they remind
    us that judicial decision makers should  be  careful  to  identify  and
    reject arguments based  on  an  alleged  near-miss,  which,  on  proper
    analysis, are an attempt to import  extraneous  qualifications  into  a
    provision of the Rules, such as that the applicant had no control  over
    the failings of or other difficulties faced by an educational provider.
    Such  factors  might  have  a  legitimate   part   to   play   in   the
    proportionality exercise, as weighing in favour of an applicant who has
    an independently strong private or family life case;  but  they  should
    not be used to diminish the weight to be given  to  the  considerations
    described in paragraph 16  of  Huang.  On  the  other  hand,  the  �800
    requirement, which was at issue in  Pankina,  lends  itself  much  more
    readily  to  near-miss  arguments  (paragraph  46  of  the  judgments).
    Although it might at first sight be said that it  does  not  matter  on
    which side of the balance factors which are extraneous to the Rules are
    placed, in fact it does.  The  proportionality  balancing  exercise  is
    unlikely to  be  properly  conducted  if  the  judge  has,  in  effect,
    substituted his or her own view of what the Rules should say.

29.   As the AIT held in KL  (Article  8-Lekstaka-delay-near-misses)  Serbia
    and Montenegro [2007] UKAIT 00044, even  if  a  near-miss  is  properly
    identified, this does not mean that the applicant will necessarily win.
    A near-miss is a factor to be taken into account and thus may still  be
    insufficient  if  the  applicant's   private   and   family   life   is
    insubstantial.

30.    In the present case, the first respondent has not shown that she  had
    a near-miss, so far  as  compliance  with  the  Immigration  Rules  was
    concerned. Paragraph 116(e) of Appendix A was not  complied  with.  The
    LSBC was not a licence holder when the application was determined.  The
    Secretary of State may, accordingly, point to the first two factors  in
    paragraph 16 of Huang as weighing, with undiminished force, on her side
    of the balance.

31.     We  therefore  turn  to  the  factors  weighing  in  favour  of  the
    respondents.  The Tribunal has to  make  a  fact-sensitive  assessment.
    This is not a case where the first respondent is facing  the  premature
    termination of a course of studies for which she has been  admitted  or
    otherwise given leave  to  pursue  in  the  United  Kingdom  (cf.  CDS,
    paragraph  22  above).   Upon  receiving  information   regarding   the
    difficulties faced by LSBC, the appellant, who, according to the letter
    from LSBC of 30 September 2009, had previously obtained  a  Diploma  in
    Business Administration, and who was then about to embark on a one year
    Advanced Diploma in Business Management with them in  London,  promptly
    decided to switch to a two year course in Leeds, designed to lead to an
    NVQ in Health and Social  Care.   No  explanation  has  been  provided,
    either in evidence or submissions,  regarding  the  first  respondent's
    reasons in this regard. But, even if she had sound reasons for what, on
    its face, is an odd change of academic direction, which has led to  her
    embarking on a course due to finish long after the  LSBC  course  would
    have finished, she is not very far advanced on the NVQ course. There is
    no evidence that  a  course  of  this  kind  cannot  be  undertaken  in
    Pakistan.  The appellant asserts that she is  regularly  attending  the
    NVQ course.  The letter of 16 November,  to  which  we  have  referred,
    purports to support that; but does  so  in  terms  which  can  only  be
    described as vague.

32.   The first respondent has been in the United  Kingdom  only  since  May
    2008 as, it seems, has the second respondent.  No reliance is sought to
    be placed  upon  any  private  life  that  the  second  respondent  has
    established in the United Kingdom.  Indeed, neither of the  respondents
    put their private life claim  on  any  basis  other  than  the  student
    activities of the first respondent.  There is no  evidence  to  suggest
    that they would face  any  difficulty  in  returning  as  a  couple  to
    Pakistan.

33.   We take account of the fact that  the  first  respondent  was  not  to
    blame in any way for the situation that led to the suspension and later
    withdrawal of LSBC's licence. However, although  the  first  respondent
    notified the Secretary of State of her switch to ONTO,  she  failed  to
    make a Tier 4 application in respect of that course.

34.   In all the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that  the  weight  to  be
    accorded  to  the  importance  of  maintaining   immigration   controls
    outweighs the weight to be placed  on  the  respondents'  side  of  the
    balance.  Their Article 8 case therefore fails.


Decision

35.   The determination of the Immigration Judge contains a  material  error
    of law and is set aside.  We substitute a  fresh  decision,  dismissing
    the appeal of the respondents against the Secretary of State's decision
    to refuse to vary their leave to remain in the United Kingdom.
