Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Norman, counsel, instructed by Sterling & Law
                    Associates LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Appellant a national of the Ukraine appealed the decision of First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Povey, who on 11 January 2018 dismissed her  appeal
    against the Respondent's decision to refuse leave to  remain  based  on
    human rights grounds.

2.   The Appellant's husband Mr [VM] had also  appealed  and  their  appeals
    were considered by the First-tier Tribunal Judge Povey under  reference
    [~].  At material times Sterling & Law Associates  were  instructed  by
    the husband, but whilst they remain on record they have no instructions
    from him, no address at which they can contact him  but  they  do  have
    some form of telephone contact with their  client.   It  appears  their
    client also has some form of  occasional  telephone  contact  with  his
    children who are in the care of the Appellant but other than that there
    was no means at the moment for the Tribunal to communicate with Mr [M].

3.   Accordingly it was agreed between the parties and myself that we  would
    proceed to hear the appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whilst  her  husband's
    appeal would be adjourned.  Further steps will be taken to establish if
    he wished to continue to pursue his appeal and if so  with  or  without
    representation.

4.   When this matter came  before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Povey  (the
    Judge) for reasons that I gave  in  writing  in  a  decision  dated  29
    September 2018, I concluded that the Judge had not  correctly  assessed
    the case law or applied it to the facts: In the context that one of the
    children of the family named [R], date of birth 22  February  2009  had
    not been properly considered.  The position was since his  birth  there
    was a second child [I], date of birth 28 June 2013 who was just under 6
    years of age.

5.   As a fact [R] has applied for British nationality and that  application
    was acknowledged on 14 March 2019 on the basis of his presence  in  the
    United Kingdom of ten years.  That application  may  be  determined  by
    September 2019 but there was no guarantee of that date.  At present  in
    the light of the considerations that apply there  was  nothing  at  the
    moment  which  raised  any  particular  difficulty  with  the   child's
    application under  the  provisions  of  Section  1(4)  of  the  British
    Nationality Act 1981.

6.   For these purposes I do not proceed on the  basis  that  he  will  have
    British nationality but I take it into account as  a  factor  that  can
    reasonably be considered in the light of the seemingly undisputed facts
    as to his presence since birth in the United Kingdom.

7.   In considering this matter I have been taken to  the  provisions  under
    the Rules in relation to paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv), in that it was argued
    that [R] was under 18 years of  age,  had  lived  continuously  in  the
    United Kingdom for seven years and it would not be reasonable to expect
    him to leave.  Ultimately this is an appeal addressing Article  8  ECHR
    grounds.  I conclude that there was an issue of the Appellant  and  her
    son and family having a family life in the  United  Kingdom  and  to  a
    degree the Appellant's son has partly a private life of which no  doubt
    his family forms the  significant  part.   I accepted  also  that  the
    Appellant has no rights to remain here and her immigration history  was
    poor.  It was clear that the Respondent's  decision  gave  rise  to  an
    interference  in  the  exercise  of  private/family  life  rights.   No
    specific  case  in  terms  of  national  security  or  public   safety,
    protection of  health  and  morals  and  the  freedoms  of  others  was
    particularly raised.  Nevertheless I concluded on the  facts  that  the
    interference was an interference  sufficient  to  engage  Article  8(1)
    rights.  I concluded that the decision of the Respondent was lawful and
    properly served Article 8(2) purposes.

8.   I therefore in that context apply in the assessment the  provisions  of
    Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and  Immigration  Act  2009,  in
    relation to the welfare of the children.  I also  apply  Sections  117A
    and 117B of the NIAA 2002.  I concluded on the  evidence  that  I  have
    received that the son, [R] of the Appellant has grown up in the  United
    Kingdom without return to the Ukraine.  On the evidence  [R],  as  does
    his sister speak English between themselves and at school but  that  in
    the home his mother communicates with them in Ukrainian  even  if  they
    respond in English.  It seemed to me the likelihood on  the  background
    evidence  was  that  the  Appellant's  son   and   daughter   have   an
    understanding of Ukrainian and if it is necessary some limited  ability
    to communicate with relatives and  others  in  the  Ukraine  on  family
    matters.  I find their preference  was  to  be  in  the  UK  and  speak
    English.
9.   The evident benefits of the provisions made both in guidance  given  to
    caseworkers and earlier guidance as long ago as DP5/96 with  the  seven
    year Rule as  it  was  then  referred  to,  embraced  a  continuity  of
    recognising that the analysis needed to be addressed under the 2002 Act
    on a discrete basis under Section 117B (6), for the Appellant  was  not
    liable to deportation and under the provisions of the Act the  question
    is whether the public interest does  require  the  Appellant's  removal
    where the Appellant has a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship
    with a qualifying child and it would not be reasonable  to  expect  the
    child to leave the UK.

10.  That was clearly a fact specific matter but there was no argument  that
    the  Appellant  does  have  such  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship.  As is clear from the case law demonstrated  recently  in
    JG (Section 117B(6): "reasonable to leave" UK) Turkey  219  UKUT  00072
    Rev 1, that there was  the  need  to  hypothesise  that  the  child  in
    question would leave the UK, even if it is not likely to be  the  case,
    and ask whether it would be reasonable to expect the child to leave.

11.  The Tribunal's analysis helpfully takes on the development of the  case
    law through KO Nigeria [2018] UKSC  53  and  explained  the  contextual
    relationship between a child and the immigration history of the child's
    parents as reflected in EV (Philippines) and  Others  [2014]  EWCA  Civ
    874.  What was  clear  and  remained  clear  was  that  Parliament  has
    intended to benefit children, who are qualifying children, and  it  was
    no issue in this case that [R] was a qualifying  child  and  that  they
    should have and be able to enjoy the benefits of status in the UK if it
    was not reasonable to require or expect the child to leave the UK.

12.  On the evidence I find that the correct assessment of the facts  showed
    that the Appellant's son, [R], was settled  in  school  in  the  United
    Kingdom and doing well albeit earlier school reports showed plainly the
    difficulties associated with language and settling  in.   Secondly  his
    social and community ties, friends are in the United Kingdom.   Thirdly
    he has never been to the  Ukraine  and  whilst  he  has  some  language
    understanding and ability to communicate, the fact was that he  has  no
    experience of life, schooling and social customs in  the  Ukraine.   It
    was unlikely he was numerate in Ukrainian or reads Ukrainian.   He  was
    not  on  any  view  fluent  in  the  Ukrainian  language  and  that  is
    demonstrated by his lack of  meaningful  contact  with  anyone  in  the
    Ukraine.

13.  Therefore the position was that [R] was a qualifying child and  it  did
    not seem to me that simply saying while he can return with  his  sister
    and his mother addressed the benefits intended by  Parliament  to  fall
    upon a qualifying child, if it is not reasonable for him to be removed.
     I did not find it becomes reasonable for  him  to  be  removed  simply
    because he would return to Ukraine with his mother and sibling  sister.



14.  On this basis, irrespective of the any weight that might  be  given  to
    his application for nationality, it seemed to me that it would  not  be
    reasonable for him to leave the United Kingdom and it follows  that  it
    is not in the public interest and disproportionate for the Appellant to
    be required to leave the UK when she is the sole carer of [R].

15.  So far as the sibling sister is concerned it seemed to  me  clearly  in
    the child's best interests to remain with her brother.   There  was  no
    suggestion there was anyone that could care for him in the  absence  of
    the mother and it  followed  logically  that  the  family  unit  is  an
    important one in the children's development.

16.  Accordingly irrespective of the position  under  Section  117B(6)  NIAA
    2002 I concluded that in relation in any event to the Appellant and her
    daughter that their removal would be disproportionate.

17.  In reaching that view I have also  taken  into  account,  although  the
    medical evidence which was very limited, that  the  Appellant's  father
    was suffering from mental health problems and left the family  home  in
    January 2019. It was uncertain what if any future role he might play in
    the children's lives or to what  extent  his  removal  would  have  any
    meaningful impact on them.  At the present time  it  appeared  that  he
    may, if minded to telephone, speak  with  the  children,  but  not  the
    Appellant, on one or two occasions a week by telephone:  I know no more
    of that contact. There was  nothing  to  indicate  he  was  financially
    supporting the children, in part or whole, nor if he  was  playing  any
    decision making role whatsoever in the daily lives of the  children  or
    if he has been doing for any particular period of time.

18.  In the circumstances it  did  not  seem  to  me  there  was  sufficient
    evidence to take a view one way or another on any significance of  this
    decision on the Appellant's husband, nor  his  failure  to  attend  the
    appeal hearing.

Decision

19.  The appeal is allowed under Article 8 ECHR grounds.

Anonymity

Given the ages of the children and the presidential guidance  it  seemed  to
me that no anonymity order was sought nor required.

Fee Award

The appeal has succeeded.  A fee of �140 was paid by the  Appellant  and  in
the   circumstances   a   fee   award   in   that   sum   is    appropriate.
