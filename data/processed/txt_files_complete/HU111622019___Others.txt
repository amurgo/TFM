                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)


For the appellant:     Mr M Murphy of  Counsel,  instructed  by  Krishmorgan
                    Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Tan, Senior Presenting Officer

This  has  been  a  remote  hearing  which  has   been   consented   to by
the parties. The form of remote hearing was video by Skype (V). A face-to-
face hearing was not held because it was not  practicable,  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing. At the conclusion of  the  hearing,
I reserved my decisions and reasons,  which  I  now  give.  The  order  made
is described at the end of these reasons.



Appeal Chronology

 1. The appellants are husband, wife and son, each a citizen of India, with
    dates of birth given as 28.5.97, 13.12.83,  and  5.7.09,  respectively.
    They have appealed with permission to the Upper  Tribunal  against  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated 23.9.19 (Judge  Lewis),
    dismissing their linked human rights appeals against the  decisions  of
    the Secretary of State, dated 14.6.19,  to  refuse  their  applications
    made on 2.1.19 for leave to remain in the UK on private and family life
    grounds.

 2. The first appellant's application was refused on suitability grounds of
    S-LTR under paragraph 276ADE(1)(i) on the basis  that  he  fraudulently
    obtained a TOEIC English language  certificate  in  November  2012,  by
    using a proxy to take his test, so that his continued presence  in  the
    UK was not  conducive  to  the  public  good.  The  respondent  further
    considered that  there  were  no  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    integration in India pursuant to paragraph 276ADE of the Rules, and  no
    exceptional or compelling reasons to grant leave to remain outside  the
    Rules pursuant to article 8 ECHR. The  second  appellant's  application
    was refused on  the  basis  of  no  very  significant  obstacles  under
    paragraph  276ADE  or  exceptional  reasons.  The   third   appellant's
    application was refused as his parents had no leave to  remain  and  he
    could not meet the requirements of  paragraph  276ADE,  or  demonstrate
    exceptional reasons to remain outside the Rules.

 3. In summary,  the  grounds  of  application  for  permission  to  appeal
    complained that the judge erred in refusing an adjournment  application
    to obtain a psychiatric report, erred in purporting he  could  make  an
    assessment using his own  "expertise",  failed  to  consider  the  best
    interests of the child, and erred in his findings in  relation  to  the
    TOEIC test.

 4. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 6.2.20, on the basis that it was  considered  arguable
    that the judge erred in failing to make a distinct assessment as to the
    child's best interests. The judge granting permission  considered  that
    the First-tier Tribunal had used the correct criteria when deciding the
    adjournment application, and that the judge's reference to  "expertise"
    related only to the fact that the Tribunal would make findings of  fact
    as  to  the  consequences  of  removal  for  the  child.  Nevertheless,
    permission was granted on all grounds.

 5. In a decision made on the papers without an oral hearing,  pursuant  to
    Rule 34, promulgated on 2.7.20, Upper Tribunal Judge Jackson  concluded
    that the decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making  of  a
    material error of law  in  relation  to  its  assessment  of  the  best
    interests of the child third appellant and on article 8 ECHR, such that
    it was necessary to set aside the decision. However, in doing so, Judge
    Jackson preserved the findings of fact made by the First-tier  Tribunal
    between [43] to [52] inclusive of the impugned decision, as well as the
    findings on article 3 of the Convention on Human Rights.

 6. Judge Jackson issued a number of directions to both the appellants  and
    the respondent, addressing in particular paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv) and/or
    section 117B of the 2002 Act, and  whether  the  respondent  considered
    that this was a new matter for the purpose of section 85  of  the  2002
    Act and whether  consent  was  given  for  such  a  new  matter  to  be
    considered in the remaking of the decision in the appeal.

 7. The appellants responded to the directions on 13.7.20, confirming  that
    they sought to rely on paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv)  and  s117B,  submitting
    further documentation relating to the third appellant.

 8. The respondent's response to the  directions,  dated  20.7.20,  accepts
    that the child third appellant had by then lived in the UK continuously
    for 7 years but contended that the appellants had not established  that
    it would be unreasonable to expect the child to leave the UK  with  his
    parents, that it would be in his best interests  to  do  so,  and  that
    there are no sufficiently compelling circumstances to justify  a  grant
    of leave outside the Rules.

 9. The resumed hearing  was  listed  as  a  remote  hearing  before  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Jackson on 23.12.20. However,  there  were  difficulties
    for the respondent in accessing the case file  electronically  and  the
    appellants did not have access to sufficient IT facilities to  be  able
    to participate in the  remote  hearing.  Judge  Jackson  adjourned  the
    hearing, relisting the matter for a face-to-face hearing at  Manchester
    Civil Justice Centre (CJC).

10. Pursuant to the Transfer Order made on  6.7.21,  the  remaking  of  the
    decision in  the  appeal  has  been  allocated  to  me  and  listed  at
    Manchester CJC on 28.7.21.

Documentary Evidence

11. Outside of the time limits set by Judge Jackson and  only  a  few  days
    before the resumed hearing, the Upper Tribunal has received  electronic
    copies of the following:

      a. The First-tier Tribunal appeal bundle (203 pps), a  paper  copy  of
         which is with the Tribunal's case file;

      b. A second bundle (62 pps);

      c. A third bundle (22 pps), including  further  evidence  and  witness
         statements

12. I also have  received  copies  of  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]  UKSC  53,  EV
    (Philippines) [2014] EWCA Civ 874, and, from Mr Tan, the  recent  Court
    of Appeal decision in NA (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2021] EWCA Civ 953.

13. I confirm that all documents now before the Upper Tribunal  and  relied
    on by either party, together with the oral  evidence  and  submissions,
    have been carefully considered in the round in the context of the whole
    before reaching any findings  of  fact.  That  is  so  whether  or  not
    documents have been specifically referenced below.

Relevant Background

14. The relevant background can be summarised as follows.

15. Each of the appellants was born in India. The third appellant is now 12
    years of age.

16. The second appellant (wife and mother) came to  the  UK  in  2009  with
    entry clearance as a Tier 4 student, later extended to September  2013.
    In April 2010, the first appellant (husband and father) was  granted  a
    Tier 4 partner  visa,  also  extended  to  September  2013.  The  third
    appellant (son) was granted entry clearance as a visitor  to  join  his
    parents for a 6 month period from July 2012. Although it was not  clear
    from the documentary evidence, it transpired during the hearing  before
    me that up until the visit visa when the second  and  first  appellants
    were both in the UK, the third appellant lived with his grandmother  in
    India.

17. Towards the end of 2012, though the precise  date  is  not  clear,  the
    first and second appellant returned to India. However, in May 2013, the
    first appellant was granted entry clearance as a  Tier  1  Entrepreneur
    valid to September 2016  and  the  second  and  third  appellants  were
    granted dependent visas in line with their  husband/father.  The  three
    appellants entered the UK together on 17.6.13. In  January  2014,  they
    all returned to India for a family wedding, staying  approximately  two
    weeks before returning to the UK.

18. On the expiry date of their visas in  September  2016,  the  appellants
    sought leave to remain outside the Rules, which was refused in  October
    2017. The first appellant attempted to judicially review this  decision
    but permission was refused on the papers in May 2018 and orally in June
    2018. A further application for leave to remain was refused in November
    2018. There then followed the application  for  leave  to  remain,  the
    refusal of which on 14.6.19 is the subject matter of this appeal.

19. It follows from the above that the appellants' immigration  status  has
    always been precarious and they have been  unlawful  overstayers  since
    the expiry of their visas in September 2016.

The First-tier Tribunal Decision

20. In relation to the  adjournment  application  made  at  the  First-tier
    Tribunal appeal hearing for a psychological report on the impact on the
    third appellant of removal to India, this was refused on the basis that
    that application was made late, was speculative, and because the First-
    tier Tribunal considered that it had sufficient material upon which  to
    fairly determine the appeals together with the Tribunal's own expertise
    of such matters.

21. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeals, finding that  the  first
    appellant had used deception by using a proxy to take his test  for  an
    English language certificate and that the respondent had discharged the
    burden of proof of establishing this.

22. In relation to the article 3 ECHR claim, the first appellant relied  on
    medical grounds of having previously been treated for  a  brain  tumor,
    which in December 2018 required no further  treatment.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal concluded that this  was  not  a  life-threatening  condition,
    there was no planned treatment, and in any event the  appellant  could,
    if  necessary,  access  India's  functioning  health  system.  In   the
    premises, the circumstances did not reach the high  threshold  required
    under article 3.

23. The First-tier Tribunal found that there would not be very  significant
    obstacles to the appellants' integration in India  and  also  concluded
    that there were no exceptional or compelling circumstances outside  the
    Rules which would render removal a disproportionate  interference  with
    the appellants' rights to respect  for  private  and  family  life.  In
    reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal noted that the parents had spent
    the majority of their lives in India, retaining a knowledge of the life
    and culture of their native country. The first appellant spoke  Arabic,
    Hindi and English. There  was  no  reason  why  the  family  could  not
    continue to  be  supported  by  their  friends  in  the  UK.  With  his
    qualifications and employment history, the first appellant would be  in
    a position to secure employment in India, and the second appellant  was
    skilled and would also be able to secure employment.

The Upper Tribunal Error of Law Decision

24. Judge Jackson's decision recorded that the respondent accepted that the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal disclosed a material error  in  the
    failure of the Tribunal to assess  the  best  interests  of  the  third
    appellant child, and in  consequence  in  relation  to  the  article  8
    assessment as a whole. Whilst the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    asserted that the child's best interests  had  been  considered,  there
    were no express findings on that subject. Judge Jackson  also  observed
    that  the  Tribunal  did  not  address  the   s117B   public   interest
    considerations.

25. For the reasons stated in her  decision  and  summarised  above,  Judge
    Jackson concluded that it was necessary to set aside  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal to be remade.

26. However, from  [15]  onwards,  Judge  Jackson  concluded  that  it  was
    unarguably open on the evidence available to the First-tier Tribunal to
    conclude that the respondent had discharged the legal  burden  to  show
    that the first appellant had indeed used a proxy test  taker  in  2012.
    The finding was adequately reasoned, having taken all the evidence into
    account. In the premises,  Judge  Jackson  specifically  preserved  the
    findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  between  [43]  and  [52].  This
    included the First-tier Tribunal's rejection of the  article  3  claim,
    for the  reasoning  summarised  above,  findings  which  had  not  been
    challenged.

27. It follows from the above that  the  first  appellant's  dishonesty  in
    using a proxy to obtain an English language certificate  and  in  using
    that to remain in the UK is a weighty factor against him in any article
    8 proportionality balancing exercise.

The Limited Issues in the Remaking of the Decision

28. It follows that the  issues  now  before  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the
    remaking of the appeal are limited to the very significant obstacles to
    integration test under paragraph 276ADE,  and,  given  that  the  third
    appellant child has lived continuously in the UK for over 7  years  and
    is a qualifying child, the 276ADE(1)(iv) test, reflected in s117B(6) as
    to whether it is reasonable to expect the third appellant to leave  the
    UK.

29. I bear in mind that whilst this is a human rights appeal, it is for the
    appellants to demonstrate  that  they  meet  the  requirements  of  any
    relevant Rules, on the balance of probabilities.  In  relation  to  the
    article 8 ECHR consideration outside the Rules,  I  have  followed  the
    Razgar stepped approach, accepting that article 8 is engaged  and  that
    removal of the appellants from the UK would interfere at least to  some
    degree with their rights to respect for private and family life.  Given
    the legitimate and lawful reason for refusing further leave to  remain,
    it follows that the  key  question  is  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise, taking into account the s117B public interest  considerations
    and assessing the best interests of the third appellant  child,  to  be
    taken as a primary consideration. In this regard, I bear in  mind  that
    once the appellants have demonstrated that article 8 is engaged,  which
    I accept they have, it is for the  respondent  to  demonstrate  on  the
    balance  of  probabilities  that  the  removal   of   the   family   is
    proportionate. Whilst each appellant is entitled to and has been  given
    individual  consideration,  there  is  no  question  in  this  case  of
    individual family members being removed without the rest of the family.
    In short, the appellants will either all remain in the  UK  or  all  be
    removed together to India.

The Appellants' Circumstances

30.  In  assessing  the  appellants'  circumstances  in  the  UK  and   the
    prospective situation on return to India, particularly  for  the  third
    appellant,  I  have  carefully  read  their  witness   statements   and
    considered the  oral  evidence,  in  the  context  of  the  documentary
    evidence, their immigration history, and the case as a whole.

31. The third appellant's short witness statement, dated 20.7.21. He is now
    12 years of age, having come to  the  UK  at  age  4,  and  is  now  in
    secondary schooling at Ripley St  Thomas  Academy.  He  speaks  of  his
    parents struggling and that their dream is to work in  the  UK  without
    help from family and friends. His own dream is to continue to study  in
    the UK and get a good job. He has many school friends,  enjoys  playing
    football, and has joined a club. He says he does not recall  anyone  in
    India. The July 2021 letter from the school's English teacher  commends
    him on  his  consistent  effort  and  fantastic  progress  in  what  is
    described as the Bedrock Vocabulary programme, for which he has won  an
    award. From his overall grades, he is undoubtedly doing well at  school
    in all subjects. The previous report  from  West  End  Primary  School,
    dated 7.7.20, confirmed that the third appellant is  committed  to  his
    education and had sought  every  opportunity  to  better  himself.  His
    learning is described as outstanding and he is an  exceptional  student
    who has engaged in many after school activities including  representing
    the school in sports.

32. The first appellant's witness statement confirms that his son wants  to
    continue with his education in the UK, and has  lots  of  friends  from
    Junior School with  whom  he  retains  contact  despite  moving  on  to
    secondary school. The first appellant suggests that his son has adapted
    to his "western style surroundings and environment" in the UK  and  his
    "ties of real substance are to his family and to  the  UK  but  not  to
    India." He is said to be doing  well  academically  and  in  particular
    mathematics. He is also involved in extra-curricular activities. It  is
    said he adores British culture, preferring the country's food,  clothes
    and language.  It is  submitted  that  returning  him  to  India  would
    adversely  affect  his  educational  and   psychological   development.
    Although the parents' native language is spoken at home, his son sticks
    to speaking English. It is suggested that in  returning  to  India  the
    third appellant would feel unconnected and the  change  would  lead  to
    social isolation. The first appellant states that  returning  to  India
    would be a "dead end with no hope with tremendously difficult financial
    situation." He asserts that given his medical circumstances,  he  would
    have  no  job  prospects  in  India  and  would  be  without  financial
    assistance  or  accommodation.  The  latest  medical  report  from  the
    consultant  neurosurgeon  confirms  that  he  remains  on  radiological
    surveillance and that there have been some changes to be monitored  but
    that "we are reassured by the fact  that  his  pathology  has  shown  a
    benign lesion."

33. The second appellant's short witness statement  of  the  same  date  is
    largely a  reflection  of  the  information  already  set  out  in  the
    statements of the other appellants.

34. The third appellant was at the hearing but remained outside and was not
    called to give evidence.  I  was  satisfied  that  given  that  Mr  Tan
    indicated that he did  not  intend  to  cross-examine  the  child,  his
    statement could be taken as read.

35. I then  heard  oral  evidence  from  the  first  and  then  the  second
    appellants, both of whom relied on their updated witness statements.

36. I found both the  first  and  second  appellants  poor  and  unreliable
    witnesses in their own cause. Their oral evidence  was  generally  very
    vague and the facts  difficult  to  ascertain  despite  my  attempt  to
    clarify the answers given to questions asked. I take into account  that
    both were giving their  evidence  in  English  and  I  have  made  some
    allowance for language comprehension  difficulties.  However,  to  some
    degree  their  evidence  was  inconsistent  with  both  their   witness
    statements and the documentary evidence. I reached the conclusion  that
    they were both prone to exaggerate or minimise where it suited them and
    that they were generally unreliable witnesses.

37. Although the first appellant maintained that if returned  to  India  he
    would not be able to work because of his age and medical condition,  he
    stated that he was in receipt of financial  support  from  friends  and
    family in the UK on the basis that he would repay the  monies  when  he
    was able to work  in  the  UK.  He  did  not  seem  to  appreciate  the
    inconsistency between his intentions to work in the UK  and  his  claim
    that he would not be able to work in India. He said that he received up
    to around �900 per month in financial support from unnamed friends  and
    family, of which there was no documentary evidence in support of either
    the amounts or the claim that this was by way  of  loans.  I  found  it
    incredible that allegedly having had an average of �900  per  month  in
    alleged financial support for some five years that there was  any  real
    prospect of being able to repay such a sum and reject  the  claim  that
    the support he has received has been as a  loan.  The  first  appellant
    maintained that he had not worked or operated any  business  since  the
    Home Office told him in 2016 that he was not  permitted  to  do  so.  I
    found this difficult to accept given that both his  witness  statements
    and in his Home Office application in 2019 he stated that the  business
    were still operating "to date". He maintained that this was a  mistake.
    However, I do not accept that he is not working in some way or to  some
    extent. He confirmed to Mr Tan that he was qualified as an  electrician
    and as an air conditioning technician. Considering the evidence,  I  am
    not satisfied that the first appellant  has  been  truthful  about  his
    income or the source of his income.

38. The second appellant also claimed that she had not  worked  since  late
    2015 but was confronted by Mr Tan with her P60 from the  2017/2018  tax
    year, showing salaried income a little under �10,000 in that year.  She
    was unable to explain the discrepancy. I  am  satisfied  that  she  has
    worked more than she has been prepared to admit.

39. Whilst maintaining that they would have no employment, no accommodation
    and no financial support in India, the first and second appellants were
    difficult to pin down as to what relatives they had in the  UK  and  in
    India. For example the second appellant stated she had only her parents
    and her grandmother in India but when pressed admitted that there  were
    other family members. In  cross-examination  she  initially  maintained
    that there were no other relatives. However, when pressed, she admitted
    that she had an aunt, her father's sister, and three sisters outside of
    India, an uncle in  Abu  Dhabi,  and  several  cousins  in  India.  She
    accepted that when they returned for a visit  in  2014  they  had  been
    accommodated by the first appellant's family.  I am satisfied that they
    were deliberately minimising the extent of family support  and  contact
    with their family members in India.  I  reject  the  first  appellant's
    account that he was "only very rarely" in contact with his own  family.
    I do not accept that they would  not  receive  support  and  help  with
    accommodation from family  members  in  India  and  am  satisfied  that
    continued financial support from friends  or  family  in  the  UK  will
    remain available to them on return.

40. I also found the first and  second  appellant  entirely  incredible  in
    respect of their claim that their son does not understand at all  their
    native language, which was said to be Malayalam. It was clarified  that
    their son was 3 years and 11 months of age when all three came  to  the
    UK in June 2013. The first appellant  suggestion  that  his  son  spoke
    barely a word of their language at that age is entirely incredible  and
    I reject the claim. It took some time and questions from me to  clarify
    that their son had not lived with them and lived some three years  with
    his grandmother in India. Given that their native language is spoken in
    the home, I am satisfied that the third  appellant  must  at  the  very
    least retain a reasonable understanding of their language, even  if  no
    longer fluent.

41. I also reject the claim made by the first appellant that his son  would
    not be able to attend school in India. He said that the school would be
    taught in Malayalam and that the subjects are  different.  However,  he
    confirmed that English and Maths  would  be  taught.  Although  he  was
    clearly evasive  in  his  replies,  he  eventually  admitted  that  all
    subjects would be taught and then admitted that he doesn't really  know
    what differences there will be.  He is not at a crucial  stage  in  his
    education  and  will  have  a  number  of  years   before   significant
    examinations and qualifications have to be taken,  allowing  him  ample
    time to adapt to life and schooling in India. I am satisfied that there
    is an education system that the third appellant will be  able  to  take
    advantage of. It may be different and less  valued  by  the  appellants
    than being able to continue his education in the UK, but that  test  is
    not of comparative quality or equality of standards or opportunity.

Best Interests of the Child

42. Pursuant to s55, I have carefully considered the best interests of  the
    third appellant child and taken this as a primary consideration in  the
    article 8 ECHR proportionality balancing  exercise  and  reasonableness
    test. In doing so,  I  have  taken  account  of  the  EV  (Philippines)
    principles that a best interests assessment will depend on a number  of
    factors including, (a) age; (b) length of residence in the UK; (c)  how
    long they have been in education; (d) what stage  their  education  has
    reached; (e) to what extent they have become distanced from the country
    to which it is proposed they will be returned; (f) how renewable  their
    connection  with  it  may  be;  (g)  to  what  extent  they  will  have
    linguistic, medical or other difficulties in adapting to life  in  that
    country; and (h) the extent to which the proposed course will interfere
    with their family life or their rights (if they have  any)  as  British
    citizens.

43. I bear in mind that the third appellant  came  to  the  UK  at  age  4,
    accompanying his parents. He was  born  in  India  and  retains  Indian
    nationality. He has been here over 8 years and all his formal education
    has been in the UK. Outside of the considerations in this appeal,  like
    his parents, he has no entitlement  to  remain  in  the  UK  or  to  be
    educated or to settle here. His parents came first as  a  student  (his
    mother) and then his father as a Tier 1 entrepreneur, but they  can  no
    longer bring themselves within the Rules. The third appellant is  doing
    very well at school, has worked hard and is  likely  to  excel  in  the
    future.  He  has  also  engaged  in  extra-curricular  activities   and
    developed friendships in Primary and, no doubt, will do so in secondary
    education. He speaks fluent English and  has  lost  to  some  uncertain
    degree his ability in his national tongue.

44. In an ideal world, his best interests would obviously be to  remain  in
    the UK and continue his education, maintaining  the  status  quo  of  a
    settled life in school and with friends and developing his social  life
    outside the family unit.

45. However, whilst he has been here now in excess of 8 years, it will only
    be the latter part of his time in which  he  has  had  any  significant
    interaction beyond the family unit,  attending  school  and  developing
    associations and friendships. Children are adaptable and  there  is  no
    reason to consider that the third appellant, who  appears  to  be  very
    bright and hard-working, will suffer any significant long-term  adverse
    effect on his mental health from relocating to India with his  parents.
    He may be sad at leaving behind his friends and life generally  in  the
    UK. However, it is the common experience of many families  to  relocate
    within the UK and to change schools. Families increasingly  also  spend
    time living in different countries. On the facts of his  case,  nothing
    about such a move is itself so traumatic an event as to  demand  he  be
    allowed to remain in the UK. I  accept  that  he  has  little  personal
    experience  of  life  in  India  and  in  many  ways  has  successfully
    integrated into life in the  UK.  However,  I  am  satisfied  that  his
    connection with India is renewable and will be all  the  more  so  with
    parental support in adapting to life in India. He will have  plenty  of
    time to settle and integrate before crucial schooling and  examinations
    come around in a few years' time.

46. Whilst there may be a short-term language challenge on return to India,
    he must be at the very least familiar with the native language  of  his
    parents and they will be able to assist  him  to  learn  and  adapt  on
    return to India. I am fully satisfied that he will within a short  time
    be able to establish himself in India and to  continue  his  education,
    developing his ties with  his  cultural  heritage  with  full  parental
    support.

47. In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the best interests of the
    third appellant will be to remain with his parents and, if his  parents
    are returning to India, to  accompany  them,  thereby  maintaining  the
    integrity of the family unit. I  find  that  it  is  not  in  his  best
    interests to remain here in the UK alone when his parents are  expected
    to return to India.

48. I have taken this best interest assessment into account  as  a  primary
    consideration in both the reasonableness assessment and in the  article
    8 proportionality balancing exercise.

Paragraph 276ADE & s117B of the 2002 Act

49. Paragraph 276ADE provides as follows:

         "276ADE (1). The requirements to be met by an applicant for leave
         to remain on the grounds of private life in the UK are that at the
         date of application, the applicant:

         (i) does not fall for refusal under any of the grounds in Section S-
         LTR 1.1 to S-LTR 2.2. and S-LTR.3.1. to S-LTR.4.5. in Appendix FM;
         and

         (ii) has made a valid application for leave to remain on the
         grounds of private life in the UK; and

         (iii) has lived continuously in the UK for at least 20 years
         (discounting any period of imprisonment); or

         (iv) is under the age of 18 years and has lived continuously in the
         UK for at least 7 years (discounting any period of imprisonment)
         and it would not be reasonable to expect the applicant to leave the
         UK; or

         (v) is aged 18 years or above and under 25 years and has spent at
         least half of his life living continuously in the UK (discounting
         any period of imprisonment); or

         (vi) subject to sub-paragraph (2), is aged 18 years or above, has
         lived continuously in the UK for less than 20 years (discounting
         any period of imprisonment) but there would be very significant
         obstacles to the applicant's integration into the country to which
         he would have to go if required to leave the UK."

Section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002

50. Section 117B provides as follows:

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all
         cases

         (1)  The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

         (2)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a)  are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)  It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a)  are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b)  are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)  Little weight should be given to-

             (a)  a private life, or

             (b)  a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)  Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

         (6)  In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.

Very Significant Obstacles to Integration

51. The appellants continue  to  argue  that  there  are  very  significant
    obstacles to their integration in India. However, like  the  First-tier
    Tribunal, I find that  there  are  significant  factors  in  favour  of
    integration, including that the parents  have  spent  the  majority  of
    their lives in India, where their son was also  born  and  lived  until
    they returned to the UK in 2013. They have strong family  and  cultural
    ties to return to, with no language barrier at least for the first  and
    second appellants.

52. It is asserted that the first appellant will be unable to work  because
    of his health issues and  that  they  will  have  no  accommodation  or
    financial support. However, for the reasons set  out  above,  I  reject
    that claim. Whilst  there  may  be  difficulties  these  are  not  very
    significant obstacles to integration. I note they are  not  financially
    independent and depend now on the significant support  of  friends  and
    family, and as the First-tier Tribunal found, I also find that there is
    no reason why that support cannot continue in India. There will  be  no
    language, social or cultural barrier  for  either  of  the  parents  to
    overcome. Whilst the first appellant has some health concerns, there is
    no active treatment and no treatment or care that he will not  be  able
    to obtain in India within its functioning health care  system.  Nothing
    in the evidence placed before the Tribunal demonstrates that he will be
    unable to work, as claimed and I note that he intends to  work  in  the
    UK, despite his health concerns. I do not  accept  that  his  condition
    will prevent him from seeking and  obtaining  at  least  some  form  of
    employment to support the family in India. As the  First-tier  Tribunal
    found, his wife is also skilled and with no health issues, there is  no
    reason why she  cannot  also  or  alternatively  obtain  employment  to
    support the family. Despite the length of time they have spent  in  the
    UK, and their desire to continue to do  so,  I  cannot  find  any  very
    significant obstacles to the parents' integration in India.

53. The third appellant  may  recall  little  of  life  in  India.  He  has
    effectively been raised and educated in the UK, living here for some  8
    years, though in a household with an undoubtedly strong Indian cultural
    heritage, where their native language is  commonly  spoken  within  the
    home. He was raised by his grandmother for three years  and  must  have
    spoken the native language during that time. Whilst he may no longer be
    fluent in his  native  language,  he  must  have  been  at  least  age-
    appropriately fluent when he came to the UK at the age of  4.  As  that
    language continues to be spoken in the home,  he  must  therefore  have
    some good familiarity with it, particularly before he started school. I
    have no doubt that, with the assistance of his parents, he will be able
    to develop a fluency sufficient to enable  him  to  continue  with  and
    develop a reasonably fulfilling life in India including  at  school  in
    India. Whilst he may wish to remain in the UK to continue his education
    and obtain employment here in the UK, his secondary school education is
    at an early stage and he is not at any crucial stage of study  such  as
    preparing for national educational qualification. In the premises, I am
    not satisfied that there are very significant obstacles  to  the  third
    appellant's integration in India, the country of his birth, nationality
    and cultural background. I am, therefore, satisfied that  none  of  the
    three appellants has been able to demonstrate that they meet  the  very
    significant obstacles test.

Insurmountable Obstacles to the Continuation of Family Life

54. This consideration, derived from Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules,
    was not argued before the First-tier Tribunal. When I raised this  with
    Mr Murphy he said he wished to keep this claim open, but I declined  to
    accept this was open to him, having never previously been  pursued.  In
    any event, as Mr Tan pointed out, the appellants  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of EX1 as neither is settled in the UK. I also  note  that
    in TZ (Pakistan) v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, the Court of Appeal  held
    that Agyarko made it clear that the scheme established by the Rules was
    lawful and compatible with article 8. The effect was that the secretary
    of state was entitled to apply a test of  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    the relocation of the family within the Rules and a test of exceptional
    circumstances outside the Rules. I  am  satisfied  that  there  are  no
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing in India as  defined
    by EX1 and Ex2 of Appendix FM.

The Reasonableness Test

55. This arises both within the Rules under paragraph  276ADE  and  outside
    the Rules under s117B in direction relation to  the  third  appellant's
    length of residence in  the  UK,  though  the  latter  is  one  of  the
    considerations for the article 8 proportionality assessment in relation
    to a parent with a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  their
    child.

56. In essence, the strongest argument for the appellants remaining in  the
    UK is that the third appellant child is now a 'qualifying  child',  who
    has been in the UK since the age of 4 and for a period now exceeding  8
    years. I recognise this is a significant period  and  a  factor  to  be
    taken into account. Paragraph 267ADE(1)(iv) provides that he may remain
    under the Rules, if it would be unreasonable to expect him to leave the
    UK. In other  words,  whilst  the  period  of  time  in  which  he  has
    integrated into UK society is important, it is not alone enough to meet
    the qualification. Inevitably, whether it is reasonable for  the  third
    appellant to leave the UK turns in significant part on the situation of
    his parents, whom I am satisfied do not meet paragraph 276ADE and  have
    no entitlement of their own to remain in the UK, and have not  done  so
    since their leave expired in 2016, some five years ago. The son is  not
    to be blamed for his parent's  immigration  history,  or  his  father's
    dishonesty and I disregard that in  assessing  reasonableness.  I  also
    take into account his best interests as assessed above.

57. Under s117B of the 2002 Act, the parents will not be required to  leave
    and the public interest in enforcing immigration control in the article
    8 ECHR proportionality balancing exercise  will  be  outweighed  if  it
    would not be reasonable to expect their son to leave the UK,  accepting
    that they have a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with him.



58. In the very recent case of NA (Bangladesh) v SSHD [2021] EWCA Civ  953,
    relied on by Mr Tan, the Court of Appeal held that where a child  whose
    parents had no entitlement to leave to remain in the UK sought leave to
    remain under the Immigration Rules para.276ADE(1)(iv) on the basis that
    they had  seven  years'  continuous  residence  and  it  would  not  be
    reasonable to expect them to leave, the  starting  point  was  that  it
    would be reasonable to expect them to leave with their parents. In that
    case the child had been born in the UK. The Court of Appeal agreed with
    the Upper  Tribunal  that  the  "powerful  reasons"  doctrine  had  not
    survived the Supreme Court decision in  KO  (Nigeria)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2018] UKSC 53, which  had  overruled  MM
    (Uganda).  It followed that  the  Upper  Tribunal  had  been  right  to
    conclude that the "powerful reasons" doctrine was no longer  good  law.
    The seven-year provision did not create a presumption in  favour  of  a
    child (and thus their parents) being  granted  leave  to  remain.  That
    said, it was important to emphasise that the approach in  KO  (Nigeria)
    did not create a presumption in the opposite direction.  It  was  still
    necessary to evaluate all the circumstances  to  establish  whether  it
    would be reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  UK  with  their
    parents. If it would not be reasonable, the family as a whole would  be
    entitled to leave to remain.

59. That decision followed a line of earlier decisions,  including  Runa  v
    SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 514, where the Court of Appeal held that the focus
    of s117B(6) had to be on the child, but the question had to be answered
    against the background of the relevant facts, which would include  what
    was likely to happen to the family unit if the person seeking leave  to
    remain was required to leave the UK.

60.  Accordingly,  I  have  carefully  considered  all  relevant   factors.
    Considering the facts of this case against the legal authorities, I  am
    satisfied that the correct starting point for the  reasonableness  test
    is that  the  first  and  second  appellants  have  no  entitlement  or
    legitimate expectation of being able to remain in the UK and  that  the
    third appellant should be expected to return with them.  I  have  found
    that there are no very significant obstacles to  their  integration  in
    India, for the reasons stated herein. Their  only  effective  remaining
    claim is through the third appellant. However, there is no  presumption
    that even 8 years of continuous residence should result in a  grant  of
    leave. Given the matters  I  have  set  out  above  in  addressing  the
    appellants'   circumstances,   individually   and   collectively,   and
    particularly in relation to the third appellant, I am satisfied that it
    would be reasonable to expect the third appellant to leave  the  UK  to
    return to India with his parents rather than to remain here in the  UK.
    In India, the family unit can continue largely  uninterrupted  and  the
    third appellant will have the assistance of his parents to  settle  and
    integrate, become more fluent in the local language, and will  be  able
    to attend school, continuing to work hard in his schooling  towards  an
    eventual career. In that  regard,  his  fluency  in  English  and  life
    experience in the UK will stand him in good stead.

61. In summary and for the reasons  set  out  above,  I  find  that  it  is
    reasonable to expect the  third  appellant  to  leave  the  UK  in  the
    circumstances where his parents are expected to return to India.

Article 8 ECHR Proportionality Balancing Exercise

62. Despite the above findings, it is necessary to go on to consider all of
    the facts  and  circumstances  of  this  case  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise between on the  one  hand  the  public  interest  in
    enforcing immigration control by removing the appellants  from  the  UK
    and on the other the extent  of  private  and  family  life  they  have
    developed whilst in the UK. I have also considered  whether  there  are
    any exceptional or  compelling  circumstances  that  would  render  the
    removal of any or all of  the  appellants  unjustifiably  harsh,  which
    would be disproportionate.

63. Article 8 is not a shortcut to compliance with  the  Rules,  which  are
    themselves the Secretary of State's proportionate response to article 8
    private and family life rights. There is a route for those who meet the
    requirements of the Rules to remain. That none of  the  appellants  can
    bring themselves within the Rules is a highly significant factor in the
    proportionality balancing exercise.

64. The public interest considerations set out in s117B  are  to  be  taken
    into account in all cases. On the one side of the balance sheet is  the
    statutory provision that maintenance of effective immigration  controls
    is in the public interest. The public interest in  removing  the  first
    appellant is enhanced by reason of his proven  dishonesty  in  using  a
    proxy to obtain an English language test certificate in 2012.  However,
    that disreputable conduct is not attributable to the  second  or  third
    appellants and I disregard it when considering their  circumstances  in
    the balancing exercise.

65. I accept that all three appellants speak fluent English but no positive
    credit can be given for that fact. More significant is  that  they  are
    not financially independent and depend on the kindness of  friends  and
    family for continued survival in the UK. Whilst  all  three  will  have
    developed a private life whilst in the UK, s117B provides  that  little
    weight is to be accorded to such private life where  their  immigration
    status is precarious, as it always was. Furthermore, since  2016  their
    immigration status has been that of unlawful  overstayers.  Neither  is
    any credit due for the appellants claim to  have  lived  a  law-abiding
    life, when that is only what is expected of a resident of the  UK.  The
    claim itself rings rather hollow in the mouth of the  first  appellant,
    given his proven dishonesty.

66. On the positive side, in the appellants' favour is that over the length
    of time they have been in the UK, I accept  that  they  have  genuinely
    attempted to integrate in the UK. This is more clear on the part of the
    third appellant, whose schooling and life outside the family home  will
    have developed perhaps more rapidly and in more significant  ways  than
    that of their parents who have been unable to work  and  for  whom  the
    home undoubtedly remains the centre of their lives.  I  recognise  that
    all three appellants have  genuine  and  understandable  ambitions  for
    their future lives in the UK and in particular for their  son's  future
    education and career. One may have some sympathy for  their  desire  to
    remain here rather than return to India.  I  recognise  that  they  and
    particularly the third appellant will be sad to  leave  behind  friends
    and associates from school. I also accept there will be difficulties in
    returning to India after several years away. However,  after  carefully
    considering the entirety of  this  case,  I  find  that  there  are  no
    particularly compelling or exceptional  circumstances,  even  including
    the third  appellant's  schooling  and  the  first  appellant's  health
    concerns. As  stated  above,  I  am  satisfied  that  they  can  expect
    financial support to continue  on  their  return  from  friends  and/or
    family in the UK, which will aid their settlement and integration.

67. Taking all factors into  consideration  and  weighing  matters  in  the
    rounds, I find that it would not be unjustifiably or unduly  harsh  for
    any and all of the appellants to return to  India  and  find  that  the
    requirement to  leave  the  UK,  the  effect  of  the  refusal  of  the
    respondent to grant leave to remain, is  not  disproportionate  to  the
    rights  to  respect  for  their  private  and/or  family  life,  either
    individually or together as a family. I am satisfied that despite  some
    initial difficulty, the third appellant will, with the support  of  his
    parents and wider family in India, be able to adapt in sufficient  time
    to resume his education without detriment to  his  long-term  education
    and career ambitions. I am satisfied that he will  be  able  to  attend
    school and that he will become fluent in the  language  he  once  spoke
    more fluently than perhaps he does now. In any event, given the history
    and circumstances described above, he will not be in the same  position
    as a child who has never had exposure to his native  language.  I  have
    also pointed to the advantages his English language and education  will
    have for his further education and career.

68. In the circumstances and for the reasons set out above, I find that the
    appellants  have  each  failed  to  demonstrate  that  they  meet   the
    requirements of the Rules for leave to remain and that  the  respondent
    has discharged the burden to demonstrate  that  the  refusal  of  their
    applications for leave to remain  is  entirely  proportionate  and  not
    unduly harsh. In reaching this  conclusion,  I  have  taken  the  third
    appellant's best interests into account and also considered that it  is
    reasonable to expect him to leave the UK. I further find no exceptional
    or compelling circumstances so that removal would  have  an  unduly  or
    unjustifiably  harsh   effect   so   that   the   decision   would   be
    disproportionate to private and family life rights.

Decision

    The appeal of each appellant is dismissed.

    I make no order for costs.
