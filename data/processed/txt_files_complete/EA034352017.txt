For the Appellant:      In person
For the Respondent:     Mr D Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

       1. This appeal comes before me following my decision  of  30  October
          2018 to set aside the determination of First-tier  Tribunal  James
          dated 27 April 2018.

       2. The appellant is a Portuguese national born on 26  May  1960.  She
          entered the UK in March 1993 and has lived here ever since. On  11
          January 2017 she applied for a permanent residence card  but  that
          was refused on 12 March 2017 on the basis that she had  failed  to
          provide documentary evidence to show that she had exercised treaty
          rights for a continuous five-year period.

       3. The appellant had challenged that decision on the basis  that  the
          judge's findings were contradictory and permission to  appeal  was
          granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Davidge on 9 August 2018.   I
          heard the challenge on 15 October  2018.  Having  found  that  the
          judge had failed to explain why she dismissed the appeal when  she
          found the appellant to have been a truthful witness, I  set  aside
          the determination.

          The hearing

       4. The appellant attended in person accompanied by  her  partner,  as
          she  had  done  on  previous  occasions.  As   before,   she   was
          unrepresented and  confirmed  she  wished  to  proceed  without  a
          representative. She relied on a chronology of  her  activities  in
          the UK since her arrival in 1993. She explained that she had  come
          to the UK to study at a private college. She had been supported by
          her father and had studied for four years, obtaining a  degree  in
          decorative arts in 1997. Following that she had been a job  seeker
          and had attended  several  job  interviews  and  visited  the  Job
          Centre. She had undertaken paid  occasional  work,  commencing  in
          1998 and continuing through to 2000 when she then became  a  field
          work researcher at Luton University for  a  six  month  period  in
          2000/2001. After that, she became an employee for Kable Ltd  until
          going on maternity leave to have  her  twins  in  late  2002.  Her
          maternity leave came to an end in May 2003. She  and  her  partner
          then decided that she should stay at home with their children.

       5. At this point in the hearing, Mr Mills indicated  that  given  the
          appellant's evidence, which he accepted, he was satisfied that the
          appellant had been exercising treaty rights for a five year period
          between May 1998 and May 2003. He had no  further  submissions  to
          make and invited me to allow the appeal.

       6. In the circumstances I had no need to  trouble  the  appellant  to
          make any submissions and I indicated that I would be allowing  the
          appeal. I give my reasons below.

          Discussion and Conclusions

       7. I have considered the submissions and the evidence. I am  grateful
          to Mr Mills for his pragmatic and wholly appropriate acceptance of
          the appellant's claim. I  found  the  appellant  to  be  a  wholly
          credible witness both at this hearing and on the past occasion she
          came before me and  I  note  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  also
          expressed a similar view.

       8. I accept that the appellant has been living in the UK  since  1993
          and has made this country her home. She has a British partner  and
          they have twin daughters now aged 16. I accept that  she  came  to
          the UK to study and indeed that she did so at  a  private  college
          for 4 years from 1993 - 1997 following  which  she  became  a  job
          seeker for 2-3 years. I accept that her  illness  interfered  with
          her plans to work full time but note that she did  undertake  part
          time work from 1998 and then in  2000  commenced  employment  with
          Luton University and then Kable Ltd until May 2003. I am satisfied
          that the appellant completed two  five  year  periods  in  the  UK
          during which she exercised her treaty rights. The first  was  from
          1993 - 1998 and the second, as accepted by Mr Mills, from May 1998
          - May 2003. I also accept that the appellant had  not  thought  it
          necessary to keep evidence of her past  activities  and  that  the
          current situation of the UK leaving the  European  Union  was  one
          which she could not have foreseen. In the particular circumstances
          of this very deserving case,  I  am  satisfied  that  despite  the
          absence of complete documentary evidence for the periods  covered,
          the appellant's oral  testimony,  combined  with  the  documentary
          evidence that is available, is sufficient evidence to make out her
          claim. I find that she is entitled to a permanent residence card.

       9. Decision

      10. The appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.

      11. Anonymity

      12. I was not asked to make an anonymity order and, in any event,  see
          no reason to do so.
