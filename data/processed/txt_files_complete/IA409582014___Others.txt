Representation:
For the claimants:     Mr E Fripp, instructed by Morden Solicitors (London)
For the appellant:     Ms A Brocklesby Weller, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The claimants, comprising mother, father and  four  children,  are  all
    citizens of Pakistan.

 2. This is his appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Emmerton  promulgated  3.7.15,  allowing  the
    claimants appeals against the decisions  of  the  Secretary  of  State,
    dated 1.10.14, to refuse their applications for leave to remain in  the
    UK on grounds of private and family life.  The Judge heard  the  appeal
    on 17.2.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Davies  refused  permission  to  appeal  on
    5.10.15. However,  when  the  application  was  renewed  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal, Upper Tribunal Judge Pitt granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    28.10.15.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 2.2.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein I find that there was an error of law in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal as to require the
    decision of Judge Emerton to be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can be briefly summarised as follows. The first
    four claimants  came  to  the  UK  as  family  visitors  in  2007,  but
    overstayed their visa limit. The second claimant made an asylum  claim,
    which was refused on 4.7.07. The two younger child claimants were  born
    in the UK, in 2007 and 2009 respectively. The first  claimant  made  an
    asylum claim in 2010, refused on 11.8.10. They did not  leave  the  UK.
    Some 4 years later, on 21.2.14 the claimants sought leave to remain  in
    the UK on the basis of private and family life, refused on  3.4.14.  On
    9.8.14, the Secretary of  State  agreed  to  reconsider  the  decision,
    resulting in the refusal decisions of 1.10.14.

 7. It thus follows that the claimants have had no right to be or remain in
    the UK since 2007. As summarised by the judge at �18, "...the  parents'
    claims, on their own, would not justify the granting of leave. They are
    failed asylum seekers and over-stayers, who have been content to  flout
    immigration law by remaining illegally  in  the  UK."  Other  than  the
    arguable claim under paragraph 276ADE in relation to  the  three  older
    children who have been in the UK over 7 years, the judge  regarded  the
    appeals as unmeritorious.

 8. At �24 of the decision the judge cited the well-know dicta from  Azimi-
    Moayed, that "As a starting point  it  is  in  the  best  interests  of
    children to be with both their parents and if both  parents  are  being
    removed from the UK then the starting point  suggests  that  so  should
    dependent children who form part of their household  unless  there  are
    reasons to the contrary."

 9. In essence, Judge Emerton found that because the older children are  in
    education in the UK, and because of their lack of Urdu, it is in  their
    best interests to remain in the UK and  applying  paragraph  276ADE(iv)
    considered it would not be reasonable to expect them to leave the UK.

10. Following on from the decision to allow the appeal of the oldest child,
    the judge went on to allow the appeals of the two other older children,
    who have also spent more than 7 years in the UK. The judge then allowed
    the appeal of the parents and the youngest child on article 8  grounds,
    it being necessary for the family to stay together.

11. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Pitt found  it  "arguable  that
    grounds two and four  have  merit  where  in  the  best  interests  and
    reasonableness assessment under  paragraph  276ADE(iv)  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did not address the family  situation  as  a  whole  and
    wider issues such as the reasonableness of the  children  returning  to
    Pakistan when this would be with their parents, the parents having ties
    in Pakistan and their ability to assist the children to reintegrate and
    so on."

12. However,  Judge  Pitt  found  no  merit  in  grounds  1  and  3,  being
    misconceived in law, and thus the appeal is limited to grounds 2 and  4
    only.

13. It is absolutely clear that there was and could  be  no  merit  in  the
    appeals of the parents either under immigration grounds, in respect  of
    which they could not qualify, or on  private  or  family  life  grounds
    outside the Rules pursuant to article 8 ECHR.

14. Whilst the judge  may  have  considered  the  factors  set  out  in  EV
    (Philippines), I am satisfied that the assessment of reasonableness  of
    removal of the children was flawed.

15. As pointed out in EV (Philippines), which case the judge cited  at  �23
    of the decision, the best interests assessment of  children  should  be
    made in the light of the real world facts that none of the  family  had
    any right to remain in the UK and in particular  the  children  had  no
    right to be educated in the UK.

16. It may be that the judge conflated the best interests  assessment  with
    the reasonableness assessment under 276ADE and failed to recognise that
    reasonableness of removal can outweigh if not entirely  displace  those
    best interests. I find that the judge failed to undertake  the  correct
    balancing  exercise  and  that  the  assessment  made  was   manifestly
    unbalanced in favour of the claimants.  Any  reading  of  the  decision
    demonstrates that the judge concentrated almost  exclusively  on  those
    factors in favour of the children and that  there  was  little  if  any
    regard given to the public interest. The advantages of education in the
    UK is not a trump card; as stated in EV (Philippines), but  ignored  by
    the judge, "we cannot educate the world." At �33 of the same  case  the
    Court of Appeal said, "Whether or not it is in the interests of a child
    to continue his  or  her  education  in  England  may  depend  on  what
    assumptions one makes as to what happens to the parents."

17. In  determining  whether  or  not  the  need  for  immigration  control
    outweighs the best interests  of  the  children,  it  is  necessary  to
    determine the relative strength of the factors which make it  in  their
    best interests to remain here, and also to take account of any  factors
    that point the other way." At �37 the Court of Appeal stated,  "In  the
    balance on the other side there falls to  be  taken  into  account  the
    strong weight to be given to the need to maintain  immigration  control
    in pursuit of the economic well-being of  the  country,  and  the  fact
    that, ex-hypothesi, the applicants have no entitlement to  remain.  The
    immigration history of the parents may also be relevant  e.g.  if  they
    are overstayers, or have acted deceitfully."

18. The assessment of whether it was reasonable  for  the  children  to  be
    removed from the UK should have taken into account significant  factors
    entire absent from consideration, including that the family was a drain
    on the public purse, being  in  receipt  of  state  benefits,  with  no
    employment or financial security. None of  the  family  was  a  British
    citizen and none had any right to be  in  the  UK.  The  parents'  poor
    immigration history was mentioned, but not given adequate weight in the
    reasonableness assessment.

19. In summary, I find that the judge failed to assess the family situation
    as a whole and  lost  sight  of  the  reasonableness  or  otherwise  of
    expecting the children to return to Pakistan with  their  parents,  who
    had ties to Pakistan, where they had spent the vast majority  of  their
    lives, and who would be able to assist their children to  integrate.  I
    reject the submission of Mr Fripp that the complaint of  the  Secretary
    of State is no more than a disagreement with the outcome of the appeal.
    I find the decision flawed and  amounting  to  such  error  of  law  as
    requires the decision to be set aside to be remade.

20. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the assessment of  a  crucial
    issue at the heart of an appeal is flawed, effectively  there  has  not
    been a valid determination of that issue. The error of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal vitiates all other findings of fact and the  conclusions  from
    those facts so that there has not been a  valid  determination  of  the
    issues in the appeal.

21. In all the circumstances, I relist this appeal for a fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, I do so on the basis that this is a case which
    falls squarely within the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  at
    paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of  the  error  has  been  to  deprive  the
    appellant of a fair hearing and  that  the  nature  or  extent  of  any
    judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision in the appeal
    to be re-made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
    in rule 2 to deal with cases fairly  and  justly,  including  with  the
    avoidance of delay, I find that it is appropriate to remit this  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusions:

22. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the decision in the appeal to be  remade  afresh
                    in the First-tier Tribunal, with no findings preserved.

Consequential Directions

23. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor House;

24. No findings are preserved. The appeal is to be reheard de novo;

25. The estimated length of hearing is 2+ hours;

26. An interpreter in Urdu will be required.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal to the Upper Tribunal has succeeded and the  outcome  of
the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal remains to be decided.
