Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant, Rahamuth Ragoonanan, was born on 11 September  1964  and
    is a male citizen of Trinidad and Tobago.  The appellant is married  to
    Ms Hameshah Green (hereafter referred to as the sponsor) and the couple
    have three children: Micky [date of birth 2 January 1994]; Tamara [date
    of birth 11 October 1996] and Rodney [date of  birth  29  April  2002].
    The sponsor and the  children  are  British  citizens.   The  appellant
    applied for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  as  a  spouse,  his
    application was refused on 9 October 2012.  The appellant  appealed  to
    the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Mensah)  which,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 25 June 2013 dismissed the appeal.   The  appellant  now
    appeals, with permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. There are two grounds of appeal.  The first  ground  asserts  that  the
    judge failed to treat the best interests of the  children  affected  by
    the appeal as a primary consideration.  That  obligation  arises  under
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act.

 3. I reject that ground of appeal.  I  find  that  the  judge  had  proper
    regard to the evidence given  by  the  children.   At  [14]  the  judge
    recorded that,

         the sponsor explained how [she and the appellant]  had  decided  to
         give their relationship another go and as they already had children
         together this was supported by the children.  The sponsor explained
         the appellant had never stopped playing a part in the lives of  the
         children but their relationship began  to  redevelop  and  lead  to
         their marriage in 2011.

    Again, at [18], the judge recorded that she had

         taken into account the interests of the British  children  who  are
         clearly settled in the UK at various  stages  of  their  education.
         They have lived in the  UK  with  their  mother  and  have  clearly
         settled here.  I have taken  into  account  the  settled  life  the
         sponsor has here and her work and family connections.

    Those factors were  taken  into  consideration  by  the  judge  in  her
    determination of the appeal on Article 8  ECHR  grounds;  both  parties
    acknowledged  that  the  appellant  could  not   meet   the   financial
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, as the judge records at [9].  It
    is clear from the judge's observations which I have quoted  above  that
    she considered it in the best interests of  these  children  to  remain
    living with their mother in the United Kingdom and that it would not be
    reasonable to expect  them  to  relocate  to  Trinidad  and  Tobago  or
    elsewhere abroad.  The grounds of appeal at [11]  complained  that  the
    judge had failed to  consider  how  the  children  might  be  adversely
    affected by their continued separation  from  their  father;  how  they
    might benefit in the presence of their father; or what  the  children's
    views might be. It would, perhaps, have been helpful if the  judge  had
    stated in greater  detail  what  she  considered  the  children's  best
    interests to be but I have to  say  that  the  matters  raised  in  the
    grounds (together with Mr Royston's oral submission that the judge  had
    erred by failing to acknowledge  that  the  children's  best  interests
    would include being brought up by both of their parents) are,  frankly,
    self-evident.  The judge has not suggested the children would  actually
    benefit by being separated from their  father;  she  has  recorded  the
    evidence of the sponsor that the appellant plays a continuing  role  in
    the children's lives and recorded  also  that  the  children  supported
    their parents' reconciliation.  I do not accept  that,  had  the  judge
    expressly reminded herself and expressly recorded in the  determination
    that the children may benefit by being brought up by both parents, this
    would have led her to a different outcome in the Article 8 ECHR appeal.
     I find that the judge had been aware of the interests of the  children
    and the outcome of this appeal and has fulfilled her obligations  under
    Section 55 of the 2009 Act thereby.

 4. The second ground records that the sponsor [a dental nurse] earns  less
    than �12,000 per annum.  The sponsor had claimed she would be  able  to
    increase her hours if the appellant joined the  family  and  helped  to
    look after the children.  Grounds also  note  that  the  sponsor  "gave
    evidence that the appellant has a history of  international  employment
    and will be able to work as a construction worker in the UK."  Further,
    the appellant relies on R  (on  the  application  of  MM  &  Others)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin)  (5
    July 2013).  Mr Royson  acknowledged  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
    determination was promulgated before the judgment of Blake J in MM  but
    he submitted that the principles enunciated by the Administrative Court
    were clearly relevant in the present case.

 5. I accept that the  principles  enunciated  in  MM  may  be  of  general
    application.  The problem for the appellant is  that,  even  had  those
    principles been applied in his case, it is  difficult  to  see  why  he
    should have succeeded.  At [16] the grounds of appeal say this:

    Features (1) and (5) from paragraph 124 of MM apply to the  appellant's
    case because given:

         (a)  the sponsor's employment record;

         (b)  the sponsor's ability to increase her hours if joined  by  the
             appellant; and

         (c)  the appellant's earning capacity.

    The appellant might have satisfied the FtT that the combined  resources
    of the appellant and sponsor would amount to at least �13,400 per year.

 6. Paragraph 124 of MM reads as follows:

    The five features [of the case] are:

    i.   The setting of the minimum income level  to  be  provided  by  the
    sponsor at above the �13,400 level identified by the Migration Advisory
    Committee as the lowest maintenance threshold under  the  benefits  and
    net fiscal approach (Conclusion 5.3). Such a level would  be  close  to
    the adult minimum wage for a 40 hour week. Further the  claimants  have
    shown through by their experts that of the 422  occupations  listed  in
    the  2011  UK  Earnings  Index,  only  301  were  above   the   �18,600
    threshold[16].

    ii.   The  requirement  of  �16,000  before  savings  can  be  said  to
    contribute to rectify an income shortfall.

    iii. The use of a 30 month period for  forward  income  projection,  as
    opposed to a twelve month period that could be applied in a  borderline
    case of ability to maintain.

    iv.   The  disregard  of  even  credible  and  reliable   evidence   of
    undertakings of third party support effected by deed and  supported  by
    evidence of ability to fund.

    v.   The disregard of the spouse's  own  earning  capacity  during  the
    thirty month period of initial entry.

 7. What is significant  here  is  that  the  figure  of  �13,400  is  that
    "identified  by  the  Migration  Advisory  Committee  [as]  the  lowest
    maintenance threshold under the  benefits  and  net  fiscal  approach".
    There was no suggestion in MM that individuals who did not  clear  that
    income threshold would be likely to be succeed under Article 8 ECHR. In
    the present appeal, the income level of the sponsor  falls  below  even
    that threshold. Even if the  judge  had  anticipated  and  applied  the
    principles of MM, the appeal under Article 8 would have failed.

 8.  Consequently,  although  the  Tribunal  has  much  sympathy  with  the
    situation in which this family finds itself, the determination  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal is legally sound and will not be disturbed. If  the
    financial position of the sponsor improves, then a further  application
    can no doubt be submitted to the ECO.









Decision

 9. This appeal is dismissed.
