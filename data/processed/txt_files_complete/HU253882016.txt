Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Forbes
For the Respondent:    Mr Mills, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Jamaican national and on October 20,  2001  she  was
    granted leave to enter the United Kingdom until November 18, 2001.  The
    appellant did not leave the United Kingdom at that point  but  remained
    and on November 5, 2010 she submitted  an  application  on  family  and
    private life grounds.  That application was  rejected  on  January  17,
    2011 because she had failed to  pay  the  correct  fee.   A  subsequent
    application submitted on February 10, 2011 was also refused.

 2. On November 18, 2014 the appellant gave birth to her daughter and  from
    October 22, 2015 the local authority  began  supporting  the  appellant
    under Section 17 of the Children's Act 1999.

 3. On March 10, 2016 the appellant made a human rights application on  the
    basis of her family life with her daughter along with her  own  private
    life.  This application was refused by the respondent  on  November  3,
    2016.

 4. The appellant appealed that decision on November 15, 2016 arguing  that
    refusing her application was a breach of her human rights and the right
    of the child as the child's father was a British citizen  and  she  was
    the child's carer and she was  therefore  entitled  to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom to look after her child.

 5. The case had originally been listed for hearing on July 4, 2017  and  a
    notice of hearing had been sent on May 25, 2017 to the appellant at [~]
    Moseley Road, Birmingham.  On June 21, 2017 the parties  were  notified
    that the case had been allocated to a "reserve list" and there  was  no
    guarantee that the case would be heard.  The  appellant  attended  that
    hearing and handed to the receptionist a piece of paper  with  her  new
    address namely [~] Lambert Street West, West Bromwich.  The appeal  was
    subsequently adjourned without the need to go into court and notice  of
    that appeal hearing was then sent out on July 6, 2017  to  the  parties
    but unfortunately the notice  was  sent  to  the  appellant's  original
    address.

 6. The case  was  subsequently  listed  before  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Hawden-Beal on November 28, 2017 and in a decision promulgated
    on December 8, 2017 the Judge dismissed the appeal noting the appellant
    had not attended that hearing.

 7. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on January 22, 2018 stating that
    the reason she had not attended the hearing was  because  she  had  not
    received notice of the amended hearing date and  she  had  only  become
    aware of the decision to dismiss her appeal following the assistance of
    her  social  worker.   The  grounds  raise  an  issue   of   procedural
    unfairness.

 8. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Saffer granted  permission  to  appeal
    finding it arguable the appellant may not have received a fair hearing.

 9. No anonymity direction is made.

    PRELIMINARY ISSUES

10. The matter came before me on the above date and Mr Mills on  behalf  of
    the  respondent  accepted  that  there  was  an  issue  of   procedural
    unfairness albeit through no fault of the Judge.  He accepted that  the
    appellant was entitled to have attended  her  hearing  and  there  were
    issues she could have addressed which  may  have  led  to  a  different
    outcome.

11. Mr Forbes, representing the appellant as a McKenzie friend,  relied  on
    the grounds of appeal that had been lodged.

12. Having heard the brief submissions and having had  the  opportunity  of
    reading the file I  accept  that  there  was  an  issue  of  procedural
    unfairness.  There is a child involved and there are issues of  British
    citizenship which will need to be dealt with by any future Tribunal.  I
    therefore set aside the decision.

13. I make it clear this error is through no fault of the Judge but due  to
    an administrative error in the non-recording of a changed address.

14. I have considered whether to retain jurisdiction in this matter  or  to
    remit this matter back to the First-tier Tribunal.  Bearing in mind the
    appellant did not have a fair hearing it seems appropriate this  matter
    be referred back to the First-tier Tribunal under Section 12(1) of  the
    Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

15. The case should be listed before a Judge other than Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Hawden-Beal.

Notice of Decision

There is an error in law.  I set aside the original  decision  and  I  remit
the matter back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  Section  12(1)  of  the
Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act 2007.

Signed                              Date January 17, 2019
