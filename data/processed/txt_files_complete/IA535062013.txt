For the respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Jobeth Lopit Daguio, date of birth 5.5.85, is a  citizen
    of the Philippines.

 2. This is her appeal against the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Shergill promulgated 23.1.15, dismissing her appeal  against  the
    decision of the Secretary of State, dated 25.11.13, to refuse leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom  as  a  partner,  pursuant  to  R-LTRP  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  The Judge heard  the  appeal  on
    8.1.15.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    17.3.15, on the basis of failure to consider the best interests of  the
    appellant's recently born child.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 4.8.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. For the reasons set out herein, I  found that there was an error of law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    determination of Judge Shergill should be set aside  to  be  remade.  I
    remitted the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal in accordance  with  the
    attached directions.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant came to the UK with leave as a domestic worker.  Within  that
    period of leave she applied on 26.9.13 for further leave to  remain  as
    the partner of a  French  national  settled  and  retired  in  the  UK.
    Following the application and before decision,  the  appellant  married
    her partner on 24.10.13 and on 8.6.14 gave  birth  to  their  daughter.
    Judge Shergill was satisfied that their relationship was genuine.

 7. Whilst the appellant may be entitled to  a  Residence  Card  under  the
    Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006,  she  did  not  make  any   such
    application. Judge Shergill found that the application had been made in
    a haphazard way and the evidence did  not  comply  with  the  specified
    evidence requirements of Appendix FM-SE.

 8. The judge then went on to consider family life outside the Rules  under
    article 8 ECHR, but the reasoning set out from �27 onwards for doing so
    is confused and it is not clear why the judge considered there were any
    compelling circumstances justifying considering family life outside the
    Rules.

 9. On the basis of the judge's findings it was concluded at �30  that  the
    decision was not disproportionate.

10. However, at �31 the judge then stated  that,  "No  live  issue  of  the
    child's interests were before me and as the appellant is represented  I
    am not obliged to deal with that on the case as pleaded."

11. That finding is in clear error of law, as established in Azimi-Moayed &
    others (decisions affecting children; onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197
    (IAC), the duty to have regard to the best interests of a child "are so
    well established that a judge should take the point for him or  herself
    as an obvious point to be considered, wherever the issue arises on  the
    evidence, irrespective of whether the appellants or the advocates  have
    done so." The Upper Tribunal also stated, "Where that evidence gives no
    hint of a suggestion that the welfare of the child is threatened by the
    immigration decision in question, or that the  best  interests  of  the
    child are undermined by such action, there is simply no basis  for  any
    further judicial exploration or reasoned decision on the question."

12. The First-tier Tribunal Judge should have addressed the best  interests
    of the child. It is impossible to say at this  stage  what  view  might
    have been taken of those best interests, even though on the face of the
    facts this is a weak case for allowing  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules, and thus failure to do so amounts to an error of law.

13. It may be that in reconsidering the matter another judge may  take  the
    view that in light of the facts of this case there is  no  prospect  of
    the child being removed from the UK, given the father's settled  status
    as an EEA national in the UK. There may also be a route for  the  child
    and the appellant through a diligent  application  under  Appendix  FM,
    taking care to address the specified evidence requirements.

14. Peculiarly, at �32, the judge  also  went  on  to  purport  to  make  a
    direction that no removal direction may be exercised because the  judge
    was satisfied that it is unlawful, reaching that view  on  a  so-called
    concession of the Home Office that removal would be  unlawful,  as  the
    appellant had a prima facie right to a family permit as the  spouse  of
    an EEA national.

15. The judge has no power  to  make  any  such  direction.  If  the  judge
    considered that the immigration decision was  unlawful,  not  being  in
    accordance with the law, the correct decision would have been to  allow
    the appeal  to  the  limited  extent  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the law and that it remains for the Secretary of  State
    to make a decision that is in accordance with  the  law.  Instead,  the
    judge went on to simply dismiss the  appeal  on  both  immigration  and
    human rights grounds.

16. Elsewhere in the decision the judge also states  that  the  appellant's
    child is a British citizen. That is not correct. She may be entitled to
    British citizenship, but as Mr  Khan  accepted,  she  cannot  become  a
    British citizen unless and until an application is made.

17. In all the circumstances, the decision is flawed for error of  law  and
    cannot stand.

18. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the facts are  unclear  on  a
    crucial issue at the heart of an appeal, as  they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal Judge vitiates all other findings
    of fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been
    a valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

19. In all the circumstances, I remit this appeal for a  fresh  hearing  in
    the First-tier Tribunal, I do so on the basis that this is a case which
    falls squarely within the  Senior  President's  Practice  Statement  at
    paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of  the  error  has  been  to  deprive  the
    appellant of a fair hearing and  that  the  nature  or  extent  of  any
    judicial fact finding which is necessary for the decision in the appeal
    to be re-made is such that, having regard to the  overriding  objective
    in rule 2 to deal with cases fairly  and  justly,  including  with  the
    avoidance of delay, I find that it is appropriate to remit this  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal to determine the appeal afresh.

Decision:

20. For the reasons set out herein, I find that the making of the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the making  of  an  error  on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I set aside set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making  of  the  appeal  to  the  First-tier
                    Tribunal.

Consequential Directions

21. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for the  decision  in
    the appeal to be made afresh, with no findings preserved;

22. The hearing will take place at Taylor House on a date to be fixed;

23. The estimated length of hearing is 2 hours (2 witnesses);

24. An interpreter in Tagalog will be required;

25. The appellant should serve and lodge with the Tribunal no later than  7
    working days before the notified hearing date  a  consolidated  bundle,
    indexed and paginated, and  containing  all  subjective  and  objective
    materials relied on by the appellant.


Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules.

Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
