                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                             APPROVED JUDGEMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -



JUDGE RIMINGTON: The applicant challenges by  way  of  judicial  review  the
      defendant's decision dated 28th August 2019 ("the Decision")  refusing
      the applicant's entry clearance application as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
      Migrant  under  the  points-based  system   and   maintained   by   an
      Administrative Review decision dated 17th October 2019.

   2. The applicant is  a  Pakistan  national  who  wished  to  undertake  a
      franchise from Wolf Italian Street Food. His application  was  refused
      under  paragraph  245DB(f)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The   other
      requirements of the points-based system were satisfied.

   3. The history to the application was  that  the  applicant  was  refused
      entry to the United Kingdom in 2014 and 2015 as a visitor and  in  May
      2017 he applied for entry clearance as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant
      and his application was refused by an Entry Clearance Officer  on  9th
      June 2017 following an  interview  on  8th  June  2017.  Following  an
      agreement by the respondent to reconsider the decision his application
      was again refused on 11th June 2018 following interviews on  16th  May
      2018 and 25th May 2018 (second and third interviews)  but  once  again
      the respondent agreed to  reconsider  the  application.  Following  an
      interview on 17th June 2019 (the fourth interview) the Entry Clearance
      Officer again refused the application  and  an  administrative  review
      dated 17th October 2019 maintained the Decision.

   4. The decision of 22nd May 2017 refused the  application  on  the  basis
      that in his first interview the applicant stated his intention was "to
      open a franchise Italian fast food 'Wolf Italian Street  Food'",  that
      he had �200,000 in his account to invest in  his  business  which  had
      been given to him by a friend, Mr Syed  Ali,  but  he  had  failed  to
      demonstrate a viable business plan and there were  inconsistencies  in
      his projections of his growth profits. Following permission to  appeal
      being granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Southern the  respondent  agreed
      to reconsider her refusal and  the  judicial  review  application  was
      withdrawn by consent. The second refusal was made on the basis of  his
      lack of experience in the "food industry" and it was noted that he did
      not have an investment partner but he had sourced  the  funds  from  a
      business partner of his in Pakistan and  that  he  was  attempting  to
      relocate to  the  UK  for  personal  reasons  rather  than  pursue  an
      entrepreneurial endeavour. Overall, his responses raised a concern  as
      to the level of knowledge attained and research  conducted  concerning
      his market and the business environment he wished to target.

   5. On 19th and 22nd August 2019,  following  the  fourth  interview,  the
      applicant's solicitors provided updated  documents  showing  that  the
      third party who had provided the �200,000 for investment had changed.

   6. The application was again refused for the third time. Judicial  review
      proceedings were commenced on 17th January  2020  and  Upper  Tribunal
      Judge Coker granted  permission  on  19th  February  2020  as  follows
      'although the grounds are lengthy and read initially as a disagreement
      with the decision reached, overall it is arguable that the decision of
      the respondent is infected by public law error'.

   7. The relevant immigration rule sets out as follows:

          "245DB. Requirements for entry clearance

                   To qualify for entry clearance as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
                   Migrant, an applicant must meet the  requirements  listed
                   below. If the applicant meets those  requirements,  entry
                   clearance will be granted. If the applicant does not meet
                   these requirements, the application will be refused.

                   Requirements:

                   ...

                    f) Where the applicant is being assessed under Table  4
                       of Appendix A, the Entry Clearance Officer  must  be
                       satisfied that:

                       (i) the applicant genuinely intends and is  able  to
                              establish, take over or become a  director  of
                              one or more businesses in the  UK  within  the
                              next six months;

                       (ii)    the applicant genuinely  intends  to  invest
                              the money referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A
                              in the business or businesses referred  to  in
                              (i);

                       (iii)   that the money referred to  in  Table  4  of
                              Appendix  A  is  genuinely  available  to  the
                              applicant, and will remain  available  to  him
                              until  such  time  as  it  is  spent  for  the
                              purposes of his business or businesses;

                       (iv)    if the applicant is relying on one  or  more
                              previous investments  to  score  points,  they
                              have genuinely invested all  or  part  of  the
                              investment  funds  required  in  Table  4   of
                              Appendix A into one or more genuine businesses
                              in the UK;

                       (v) that the  applicant  does  not  intend  to  take
                              employment in the United  Kingdom  other  than
                              under the terms of paragraph 245DC.

                    g) The applicant must provide a business plan,  setting
                       out his proposed business activities in the  UK  and
                       how he expects to make his business succeed.

                    h) In making the assessment in (f), the Entry Clearance
                       Officer will assess the  balance  of  probabilities.
                       The Entry Clearance Officer may  take  into  account
                       the following factors:

                       (i) the evidence the applicant has submitted;

                       (ii)    the viability and credibility of the  source
                              of  the  money  referred  to  in  Table  4  of
                              Appendix A;

                       (iii)    the  viability  and  credibility   of   the
                              applicant's business plans and market research
                              into their chosen business sector;

                       (iv)    the  applicant's  previous  educational  and
                              business experience (or lack thereof);

                       (v) the applicant's immigration history and previous
                              activity in the UK; and

                       (vi)    any other relevant information."

   8. The challenge to the Decision cited effectively three grounds,

          (i) the interviews were conducted in a procedurally unfair manner,

          (ii)    the adverse credibility findings  were  irrational  and/or
                 arrived at in a procedurally unfair manner and

          (iii)   the  respondent  failed  to  take  into  account  material
                 evidence  relating  to  the  applicant's   employment   and
                 education and the applicant's business plan.

   9. Ground (i) In the first ground it was submitted  that  the  manner  in
      which the interviews were conducted was procedurally unfair, the  poor
      transcribing of the interviews had prejudiced the  applicant  and  his
      answers could not properly be analysed and assessed  by  the  decision
      maker and some of the transcribing did not make sense .  There  was  a
      use of ellipses because the interviewer could not hear  the  applicant
      thereby cutting out the answers, making them difficult  to  understand
      and causing them to jump between topics. The challenge concentrated on
      the  fourth  interview,  which  had  asserted  that  the   interviewer
      seemingly could not hear the applicant but did not alert  him  to  the
      same. For example

          "8. ...

                 . Q.9, p.64: 'sounded like'

                 . Q.11, p.64 'production of (something)'

                 . Q.14, p.66: '... (Mumbling) ...'

                 .  Q.19,  p.67:  '(...  something   like   blame   again)',
                   '(Mumbling)'

                 . Q.24, p.71: '... so why should ... ... ...  ...  ...  ...
                   ... ... and ... ... .'

                 . Q.32, p74: '(Something not understandable)'

                 . Q.33, p.75: '(mumbling ...)'

                 .  Q.35,  p.76-77  '(something  mumbled)',  '(not  sure  of
                   name)', '(not sure of name mentioned)'

                 . Q.36, p.7    ' (mumbling[pic]

                 . Q.37, p.77: '(unclear)'

                 . Q39, p.79: '(unclear - annually ...??)'

                 . Q.40, p.79: '(Some  name  mentioned  -  Tim  Entwistle  -
                   Looked up on Google)', '(Requested  to  repeat  name  and
                   spell) Then (Rainbran ...??)',  'This  is  early  morning
                   ...??'"

  10. It was asserted that simply because the  applicant  indicated  he  was
      happy at the time did not mean that  the  interview  was  procedurally
      fair, which it was not. Reliance was placed on R (on  the  application
      of Anjum) v Entry Clearance Office, Islamabad (entrepreneur - business
      expansion - fairness  generally)  [2017]  UKUT  00406,  which  at  the
      headnote set out:

          "(ii)   An immigration interview may be unfair, thereby  rendering
                 the   resulting   decision   unlawful,   where   inflexible
                 structural adherence to  prepared  questions  excludes  the
                 spontaneity  necessary  to  repeat   or   clarify   obscure
                 questions and/or to probe or elucidate answers given."

      The decision maker had relied almost exclusively on the  interview  in
      coming to the decision that was not properly transcribed.

  11. The applicant was asked about his business plan at question 19 and was
      accused of skirting around the question  but  he  was  not  given  the
      chance to rectify this before the line of questioning moved on. It was
      incumbent upon the respondent to put  this  matter  to  the  applicant
      before  making  such  an  adverse  credibility   finding.   That   was
      procedurally unfair.

  12. Reliance was also placed on Mushtaq, R (on the application of) v Entry
      Clearance Officer of Islamabad,  Pakistan  (ECO  procedural  fairness)
      [2015] UKUT 224, in particular where the headnote recorded:

          "(ii)   ECO interviews serve the basic twofold purpose of enabling
                 applications   to   be   probed   and   investigated   and,
                 simultaneously, giving the applicant a fair opportunity  to
                 respond  to  potentially  adverse  matters.   The   ensuing
                 decision must accord  with  the  principles  of  procedural
                 fairness."

  13. The grounds referred to Balajigari v Secretary of State for  the  Home
      Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673 and R (ex parte Doody) [1994] 1 AC 531,
      which stated the following principle:

          "Since  the  person  affected  usually  cannot   make   worthwhile
          representations without knowing what factors may weigh against his
          interests fairness will very often require that he is informed  of
          the gist of the case which he has to answer."

  14. Although the defendant argued that the applicant  was  asked  numerous
      times as to his business plan the interviewer did not explain when his
      answers were unsatisfactory for him to comment so  that  he  knew  the
      gist of the case  he  had  to  answer  and  this  was  an  example  of
      inflexible structural adherence to prepared questions.

  15. Ground (ii) Intertwined with the procedural fairness challenge it  was
      asserted that the adverse credibility  findings  were  irrational  and
      examples were given.

          "a. Input into business plan"

  16.  The  applicant  gave  responses  which  showed  he  was   a   genuine
      entrepreneur and indicated his research input into his  business  plan
      in the third interview. It was incumbent upon the  respondent  to  put
      the matter of 'skirting around' the business plan rather  than  moving
      on immediately.

          "b. Plans for the future and product knowledge"

  17. The applicant gave various answers in relation to the  future  of  his
      business and at no point was it put to the applicant he had not  given
      adequate answers. There was no indication as to when it was put to the
      applicant that his answers were unsatisfactory for him to comment.  He
      was criticised because he had never visited  an  Italian  street  food
      establishment but he was not asked about this.

          "c. Failure to know minimum wage"

  18. It was conceded that he did not know the UK minimum wage but this  was
      not material or substantial. He gave a full breakdown of the number of
      people he would employ and in the third interview had given answers in
      relation to  his  proposed  business  in  the  UK  and  his  extensive
      research.

          "d. Location"

  19. The applicant had no entry clearance to visit the UK and therefore  to
      make adverse credibility findings on  this  basis  and  criticise  the
      applicant for not entering the UK was  irrational.  He  could  not  be
      criticised for not choosing another specific location  in  the  United
      Kingdom but he had stated that  the  Wolf  franchise  had  a  property
      adviser. This indicated he was a genuine entrepreneur.  The  applicant
      had always indicated Hounslow as a proposed area but in the event,  he
      did indicate that Scotland could be a choice for the future  owing  to
      the franchise's expansion there but it was not a  requirement  of  the
      Immigration Rules that he had to have many location options  in  mind.
      He had given reasons for the  choice  of  Hounslow  and  outlined  the
      research such as the UK food eating out market was growing rapidly and
      the food business in the UK was growing  rapidly.  There  had  been  a
      decrease in unemployment and an increase in national  wages  (question
      27) and the UK  �16,400,000,000  food  market  was  expected  to  grow
      (question 27).

  20. The applicant clearly had done detailed research in  relation  to  the
      location of his proposed future business.

          "e. Marketing and fund allocation"

  21. The applicant was asked how he would spend the �200,000  and  did  not
      mention what funds would be used for marketing  (question  30  of  the
      fourth interview) but later went on to state  that  �70,000  would  be
      used for marketing over a three year  period.  The  respondent  claims
      that this shows the applicant was not able to  "talk  about  how  they
      propose to spend their funds and how they would use them  to  aid  the
      business" but the applicant had clearly explained the marketing budget
      was derived from circa 4% of the net revenue.

  22. If the Entry Clearance Officer specifically wanted a breakdown of  the
      �70,000 s/he could have asked this question but did not.

  23. The Decision did not explain how the applicant rationally did not have
      sufficient knowledge of his expenditure or  explain  why  his  answers
      were not satisfactory. The Entry Clearance Officer did  not  give  the
      applicant an opportunity to clarify his answer at question 39.

  24.  The  applicant  discussed  the  allocation  of  funds  and  financial
      breakdowns in the following questions in interview.

          Question 21 (salaries),

          question 30 (fees for the business unit,  legal  fees,  royalties,
          equipment, infrastructure, furniture),

          questions 40 to 43 (turnover for his business),

          question 44 (the calculation of those profits) and

          questions 40 and 46 (fees to be paid to the franchisor).

  25.  It  was  submitted  that  this  demonstrated  him  to  be  a  genuine
      entrepreneur and the respondent had failed to  consider  the  detailed
      responses to other answers.

          "f. Reasons for relocating"

  26. The applicant was criticised for  allegedly  relocating  for  personal
      reasons rather than to pursue a business but he had been through  over
      two and a half years of litigation, showing his  commitment,  and  any
      decision to move must be one that involved a  personal  consideration.
      The applicant had extensive  research  of  his  local  area.  To  only
      reference one statistic, that is the 2001 census, was an  artificially
      restrictive analysis of the applicant's evidence.

      Third ground: Failure to take into account material evidence

  27. The applicant had substantial experience in the food industry and  the
      respondent had not even made  a  cursory  reference  to  this  in  the
      refusal. He had tertiary education in the form of a BSc in agriculture
      with significant emphasis on food technology and had been employed  in
      the food industry and food supply chains, for example  at  PepsiCo  in
      Pakistan. His most recent employment in the  agrochemical  sector  was
      based on food technology.

  28. The respondent indicated the  applicant  had  worked  in  the  'potato
      industry', which artificially diminished  the  applicant's  background
      and skills. The respondent averred in the response to  the  pre-action
      Protocol that this experience was  not  entirely  transferable  to  an
      Italian street food establishment but no rational reasons  were  given
      why extensive academic experience in the agricultural field and  years
      of experience in business and the food industry were not transferable.
      This was irrational  and  a  baseless  assertion.  The  applicant  had
      extensive educational and employment experience.

  29. Further, there was a failure to take into account material evidence in
      the form of a business plan. The applicant had provided  an  extensive
      business  plan  setting  out  all  the   above-   mentioned   business
      considerations but none of it had been considered  by  the  respondent
      nor had the respondent explained why no weight  should  be  placed  on
      this professional and detailed document. There was  one  reference  to
      one statistic and this did not  show  the  respondent  took  the  plan
      holistically or properly into account.

  30. The respondent also argued that the applicant was unable or  unwilling
      to explain involvement in the plan but it was submitted that this  was
      not the case.

      The respondent's defence

  31. In response, the respondent addressed the grounds in a different order
      but submitted that:

  32. Ground 1: Procedural fairness

      (1) In relation to procedural unfairness the applicant  was  asked  on
          more than one occasion about the specifics of his  business  plan,
          for example at questions 6, 20 to 22, 24 to 26, 29 to 30, 35 to 37
          and specifically question 19 of the fourth interview.

      (2) In relation to his lack of  clarity  concerning  his  longer  term
          plans the transcript showed that the applicant more than once  was
          asked concerning his future plans.

      (3) In relation to his marketing  budget  the  transcript  showed  the
          applicant was given ample opportunity to  explain  in  detail  his
          expenditure on this point.

      (4) At the conclusion of the interview the applicant was asked whether
          he understood the questions and whether he wished to add  anything
          at question 48 and he did not reply.

  33. The applicant was afforded ample opportunity to explain his intentions
      in relation to his business in the UK.

  34. Procedural fairness did not require an Entry  Clearance  Officer  when
      interviewing an applicant for entry clearance to put  matters  to  the
      applicant  in  the  manner  suggested  before   drawing   an   adverse
      credibility finding from his answers as could be seen  from  ex  parte
      Doody [1994] 1 AC 531. In R (Dirshe) v Secretary of State for the Home
      Department [2005] EWCA Civ 421, in the context  of  asylum  interviews
      the Court of Appeal held that the requirement of  procedural  fairness
      was met so long as the  applicant  has  "an  adequate  opportunity  to
      challenge [the] reliability or adequacy" of the interview record.

  35. In the present case this opportunity was afforded to the applicant  by
      way of administrative review. In Mapah v Secretary of  State  for  the
      Home Department [2003] EWHC 306 (Admin) Pitchford J dismissed a  claim
      brought by a francophone asylum seeker who had argued inter alia  that
      the  lack  of  a  complete  verbatim  record  of  his  interview   was
      procedurally unfair but in that case it was acknowledged that problems
      in interpretation could and do occur and that "records cannot  always,
      despite exhortation, be literally verbatim".

  36. In the applicant's case the Entry Clearance Officer explained that  "I
      have to record both my questions and  your  answers  and  so  will  be
      typing as we speak".  The  respondent  accepted  that  the  transcript
      contained numerous typographical errors as well as errors  of  grammar
      and syntax but denied that this had any bearing on the Entry Clearance
      Officer's assessment of credibility. It is evident the Entry Clearance
      Officer strived to ensure as accurate  a  record  of  the  applicant's
      answers as possible including his  hesitations  and  digressions.  The
      applicant's suggestion that the transcription might  adversely  affect
      his credibility was simply unsustainable. The mistakes on  typing  and
      syntax did not prevent  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  from  properly
      analysing and assessing the answers as shown by the Decision.

  37. In relation  to  the  adverse  credibility  findings  with  regard  to
      business plan and his longer term plans, the applicant was given ample
      opportunity to address these points  but  he  was  also  afforded  the
      opportunity to challenge those findings as part of the  administrative
      review, an opportunity which he availed himself of.

      Ground 3: The Entry  Clearance  Officer  was  reasonably  entitled  to
      conclude that the applicant's application was not credible

  38. There were various criticisms made of the reasonableness of the  Entry
      Clearance Officer's Decision  but  these  amounted  to  no  more  than
      disagreements with the decision and did not disclose  any  public  law
      error.

  39. The respondent was entitled to find that the applicant' s  persistence
      in seeking lawful entry to the UK was unrelated to the genuineness  of
      his intention to establish himself as an entrepreneur, particularly in
      light of the vague and rambling nature of many of his answers  to  the
      Entry Clearance Officer's questions.

  40. Secondly, the Entry Clearance Officer was reasonably entitled to  find
      that the answer concerning his input into his own  business  plan  was
      vague and evasive. There was criticism that the respondent had  failed
      to explain why 'no weight should be placed  on  the  professional  and
      detailed document' (business plan) but given the applicant's inability
      or unwillingness to explain the  extent  of  his  involvement  in  his
      business plan, taken together with the vague quality of  many  of  his
      other answers it was  entirely  reasonable  for  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer to place relatively little weight on the details contained  in
      the business plan.

  41. Thirdly, when the Entry Clearance Officer asked the applicant  whether
      he was going to specialise in Italian street food the Entry  Clearance
      Officer was entitled to place weight on the applicant's very  hesitant
      response that "no-one's plans is final till ever, we  can  change,  we
      can brand mix" and "Italian and brand mix may be the other option  but
      right now we are  going  for  Italian  street  food".  This  showed  a
      remarkable degree of uncertainty for an applicant professing to invest
      �200,000 in a business.

  42. Fourthly, the Entry Clearance Officer was  equally  entitled  to  find
      that despite three interviews over a period of two and  a  half  years
      there was no evidence that the applicant had ever visited  an  Italian
      street food establishment nor that he had ever tasted any of the  food
      from Italian Wolf Street Food.

  43. There was no averral  or  witness  statement  from  the  applicant  to
      contradict this finding nor was  there  anything  baffling  about  the
      Entry  Clearance  Officer's  finding  that  the  applicant,   a   food
      technologist with no prior  experience  of  operating  a  street  food
      franchise, did not have relevant commercial experience to  operate  an
      Italian street food franchise in a country that he had never visited.

  44. Fifthly, it was reasonably open to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
      conclude  that  the  applicant's  answers  concerning  his  choice  of
      location  for  his  business   and   his   lack   of   research   into
      [pic]alternative locations was indicative of a lack of his genuineness
      as an entrepreneur.

      Ground 2: The Entry Clearance Officer took into account  all  relevant
      evidence

  45.  Whilst  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer's  characterisation   of   the
      applicant's experience was terse, it was not inaccurate  and  did  not
      amount to a material error when stating:

          "It is acknowledged that the first refusal  did  not  include  all
          your client's experience in the food industry including their  BSc
          in agriculture, food  technology,  PepsiCo  and  the  agrochemical
          sector. However, it is considered  that  the  skills  your  client
          holds are not entirely transferable  to  an  Italian  street  food
          establishment."

  46. The respondent was, in any event, entitled to clarify the point in her
      pre-action response, see R v City of  Westminster,  ex  parte  Ermakov
      [1995] EWCA Civ 42, [1992], which made clear  that  such  material  is
      perfectly  appropriate  for  the   purposes   of   "elucidation"   and
      "confirmation".

  47. It was submitted that the applicant's lack of research for his  choice
      of location concerned the Entry Clearance Officer  but  the  applicant
      submitted  that  the  respondent  failed  to  take  account  that  the
      applicant had done "detailed research in relation to the  location  of
      his proposed future business". In fact, the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
      did not find the applicant had failed to  undertake  any  research  on
      this point but he had included statistics taken from the  2001  census
      in relation to Hounslow and stated  he  was  not  satisfied  that  the
      applicant had conducted any "recent research on where you  propose  to
      locate your business" .

  48. Moreover, the applicant complained that he had provided  an  extensive
      business  plan  setting   out   all   the   above-mentioned   business
      considerations but  that  none  of  it  had  been  considered  by  the
      respondent. This, however, was  directly  contradicted  by  the  Entry
      Clearance  Officer's  Decision,  which  explicitly  referred  to   the
      contents of the business plan stating "I note that  in  your  business
      plan you included statistics from a Hounslow 2001 census".

  49. In relation to the ECO's finding  that  the  applicant's  inconsistent
      answers concerning his marketing budget the applicant claims  that  he
      "clearly explained that the marketing budget is being derived from  c.
      40% of the net revenue". It was an obvious point that the net  revenue
      could not sensibly be used to fund marketing at the initial launch and
      the Entry Clearance Officer was in any event entitled to note that  "a
      genuine entrepreneur would be able to talk about how they spend  their
      funds and how they  will  use  them  to  aid  the  business".  As  the
      respondent's pre-action response made clear, "a  genuine  entrepreneur
      would  be  able  to  give  a  more  exact  breakdown  of  what,   more
      specifically, �70,000 worth of  marketing  would  be  spent  on,  than
      newspapers' and 'social media'[pic]

      Submissions at oral hearing

  50. In his submissions Mr Irwin submitted that the principles in  relation
      to procedural fairness were laid down in R v Secretary  of  State  for
      the Home Department, ex parte  Doody.  This  case  was  distinct  from
      Balajigari, which was of little or no assistance because:

      (a) In Balajigari  cases  fundamental  rights  were  engaged  and  the
          applicants had been in  the  UK  for  extended  periods.  In  this
          instance the applicant had no private or family life.

       b)  In  Balajigari  cases  clear  findings  of  dishonesty   and   of
          reprehensible conduct were made. Here there were  questions  about
          the applicant's credibility in his ability to be able to establish
          a business and there was no finding he had been dishonest.

       c) It was not standard practice to interview ILR candidates  although
          the Secretary  of  State  retained  a  discretion  to  do  so.  At
          paragraph 159 of Balajigari the court considered a case  in  which
          the applicant had been interviewed  prior  to  making  an  adverse
          decision and was  only  just  satisfied  that  the  interview  was
          insufficient and the only reason the court was not  satisfied  was
          because the applicant was given no notice at all of the nature  of
          the issues to be canvassed in the interview. That contrasted  with
          the facts of this case where the applicant knew in  general  terms
          the issues he was required to address.

       d) There were no human rights consequences to the applicant  in  this
          case.

  51. In  terms  of  the  interview  transcripts  there  was  no  procedural
      unfairness. It was well-established following Mapah  and  Dirshe  that
      the requirement of procedural fairness was met if an applicant had  an
      adequate opportunity to challenge the reliability or the  adequacy  of
      the interview record and the decisions in Mapah and Dirshe came in the
      context of asylum appeals in which the fundamental  rights  on  asylum
      were engaged and where the standard procedural fairness  demanded  was
      of the highest nature.

  52. The  applicant  had  a  chance  to  respond  and  more  than  adequate
      opportunity to address the issues which the respondent  considered  in
      the course of making the decision. The applicant's business  plan  was
      explored extensively in the course of the  interview  and  his  future
      plans were explored in the same way.

  53. There was no procedural unfairness and any  assessment  of  procedural
      fairness must take account of the facts of the case.

  54. In response, Ms Gherman submitted that the duty to disclose  the  case
      adverse to the applicant did not depend on pre-existing rights and she
      cited paragraph 50 of Balajigari. There  was  also  the  duty  in  the
      interview process to be more specific.

  55. Secondly, there was the finding that he was not a genuine entrepreneur
      and she referred to paragraph 125 of Karagul v Secretary of State  for
      the Home Department  [2019]  EWHC  3208  (Admin).  The  findings  were
      serious and would  have  future  consequences.  Thirdly,  the  genuine
      entrepreneur test was very wide and it was not possible to  know  from
      the vast wide ambit of concerns the gist of what was of concern.

  56. Further, she submitted that at the administrative  review  there  were
      challenges to the interview. The  reliability  of  the  interview  was
      challenged in the pre-action Protocol letter. The reliability  of  the
      interview was of central importance.

  57. In relation to ground 2  and  rationality,  Mr  Irwin  submitted  that
      looking at the evidence in the round  the  respondent  was  unarguably
      entitled to reach the  conclusion  that  the  applicant's  application
      should be refused. The applicant's responses in interview were  vague,
      the applicant had never visited an Italian street food  establishment,
      had no experience in running a street food franchise and there was  no
      public law error.

  58. Specifically, Ms  Gherman  submitted  there  were  challenges  to  the
      interview process. The reliability was challenged  to  the  pre-action
      Protocol. The interviews gave an impression of carelessness.

  59. In his submissions in relation to ground 3 and taking into account all
      relevant evidence, Mr Irwin submitted that the respondent was entitled
      to find that the experience of agriculture and the food  industry  was
      of little or  no  relevance  to  running  a  fast  food  franchise  in
      Hounslow. The challenge to the decision noted the applicant had worked
      in the potato  industry  but  that  he  did  not  have  the  requisite
      experience to run his proposed business. That was rational.  Regarding
      location the respondent was  concerned  the  applicant  had  not  done
      recent research and relied on the 2001 census.

  60. The respondent took into account evidence in the round. The respondent
      was concerned about the approach to the marketing budget. In  relation
      to the business plan it was clear that the  Secretary  of  State  took
      into  account  the  contents  of  the  business  plan.  It  formed   a
      substantial part of the basis of the questioning of the applicant  and
      there was specific reference to the business plan.

  61. Ms Gherman submitted that the business  plan  had  not  been  properly
      taken into account. There was only  one  reference  to  the  marketing
      budget and the answers were consistent  with  the  business  plan  and
      showed that the applicant was a genuine entrepreneur, for example  his
      reference to �70,000 for the marketing was correct and he had  details
      of the salaries of employees.



Analysis

  62. I address each ground in turn but have logically taken  ground  3,  in
      relation to the consideration of relevant evidence prior to  ground  2
      on rationality.

  63. In relation to the first ground, the following principles on  fairness
      are set out in Doody:

         "1. Where an Act of  Parliament  confers  an  administrative  power
         there is a presumption that it will be exercised in a manner  which
         is fair in all the circumstances. 2. The standards of fairness  are
         not immutable. They may change with the passage of  time,  both  in
         the general and in their application to decisions of  a  particular
         type. 3. The principles of fairness are not to be applied  by  rote
         identically in every situation. What fairness demands is  dependent
         on the context of the decision, [my underlining] and this is to  be
         taken into account in all its aspects. 4. An essential  feature  of
         the context is the statute which creates the discretion, as regards
         both its language and the shape of  the  legal  and  administrative
         system within which the decision is taken. 5.  Fairness  will  very
         often require that a person who may be adversely  affected  by  the
         decision will have an opportunity to make  representations  on  his
         own behalf either before the decision  is  taken  with  a  view  to
         producing a favourable result; or after it is taken, with a view to
         procuring its modification; or both. 6. Since the  person  affected
         usually cannot make worthwhile representations without knowing what
         factors may weigh against his interests fairness  will  very  often
         require that he is informed of the gist of the case which he has to
         answer."

  64. The standards of fairness are not immutable and can vary  in  relation
      to decisions of a particular type. The principles of fairness are  not
      to be applied identically in every situation. As identified  in  Doody
      "What fairness demands is dependent on the context of  the  decision."
      That said, the question of whether there has been procedural  fairness
      or not is an objective question for the court to decide.

  65. This was an entry clearance application for a business visa. That is a
      rather different context from an asylum claim or  even  one  where  an
      applicant has established a private or family life within the UK as in
      Karagul and Balajigari. In Karagul,  the  applications  were  made  by
      claimants who were residing in the United Kingdom under the  agreement
      establishing an association between the  European  Economic  Community
      and Turkey. It may be the case as Ms Gherman submits that there do not
      need to be pre-existing rights  to  invoke  principles  of  procedural
      fairness but the context as seen from Doody is still relevant.

  66. There are further distinct differences between  this  application  and
      the applications made in Balajigari and in Karagul.

  67. Karagul was an example of  a  case  where  there  was  an  unequivocal
      finding of  dishonesty  which  demands  the  highest  of  fairness  in
      procedure and again  in  Balajigari  there  was  a  clear  finding  of
      dishonesty in relation to the applicant and  their  applications  were
      refused under paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules.  In  Karagul,
      the decisions under challenge had concluded that the applicants either
      had not genuinely established a  business  or  genuinely  intended  to
      establish a business and the applications were made "in bad  faith  or
      dishonestly". That is not the ultimate conclusion that  can  be  drawn
      from the Decision under challenge.

  68. The Decision contained various adverse conclusions on genuineness  for
      example 'a genuine entrepreneur would openly be able to talk about the
      input they had made into their own business plan' and 'I do  not  find
      it reasonable that a genuine entrepreneur would invest  over  �200,000
      with no clear plans for the future' and 'you have  not  conducted  any
      significant research into the UK minimum wage and I do not  find  this
      conducive of a genuine entrepreneur', but there was, in conclusion, no
      clear finding of dishonesty, nor reprehensible  conduct,  or  a  clear
      allegation of a false based application in this Decision when read  as
      a whole.

  69. The Entry Clearance Officer expressed in the course of  the  reasoning
      his doubts about the credibility of the application. For example, when
      addressing credibility, having reviewed the response to a question  on
      location of the business and whether the applicant had looked  outside
      the UK, the Entry Clearance Officer cited the applicant's answer

         "... 'no ... I applied only for UK and therefore I am trying to  be
         there for UK' and also said 'I don't think I should see  any  other
         country where my base roots are there,  my  business  partners  are
         there, my family's friends are there, I'm adoptable person'

      and the Entry Clearance Officer observed on  the  credibility  of  the
      application as follows:

         'these comments indicate that you are looking to relocate to the UK
         for personal reasons  rather  than  to  pursue  an  entrepreneurial
         endeavour. Your intentions bring into doubt your credibility  as  a
         Tier 1 Entrepreneur."

  70. Credibility  can  contain  more  than  one  meaning  and  it  must  be
      considered in the context used. As Mr Irwin indicated, if  he  applied
      for the position of a Lord Chief Justice at his stage in his career he
      would not be a  credible  candidate;  he  may  be  misguided  but  not
      dishonest. In the Decision under challenge  there  was  no  threat  or
      finding as in Adedoyin [2012] EWCA Civ 939.

  71. In the whole analysis of the  Decision,  which  was  extensive,  these
      observations merely render his business plans in context, that  is  he
      was not primarily a businessman  but  more  wished  to  move  for  his
      children's education. That approach to the evidence was  open  to  the
      Entry  Clearance  Officer,  who  was  assessing  the  quality  of  the
      evidence, and was not wholly irrelevant when considering  whether  the
      applicant could credibly establish a business in the UK.

  72.  As  pointed  out  by  Mr  Irwin,  there  was  no  indication  of  any
      consequences or threat that the application was made on a false  basis
      and  the  applicant  was  advised  as  to  how  to  proceed  with   an
      administrative review should he wish to challenge the Decision.

  73. Indeed, the Decision  continues  to  the  concluding  point  which  is
      axiomatic to the refusal as follows:

          "Your responses raise a concern to the level of knowledge attained
          and  research  conducted  concerning  the  market   and   business
          environment you wish to target and operate  within.  In  light  of
          this there are doubts concerning your  ability  and  intention  to
          establish an entrepreneurial enterprise in the UK.

          I have considered your application and circumstances;  however,  I
          am not satisfied  on  the  balance  of  probabilities,  that  your
          business  plan  or  intentions  are  viable  and  credible.  I  am
          therefore  not  satisfied  that  you  meet  the  requirements   of
          paragraph 245DB(f) of the Immigration Rules."

  74. Whatever the preamble to the actual reason for refusal and the  doubts
      held  by  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  it  was  the  viability  and
      credibility of the business which was fatal to the application.

  75. Karagul sets out various principles in relation to procedural fairness
      at paragraph 106 at (ix) and (x) where 'genuine intention or wish'  is
      concerned and those principles identify that an  interview  should  be
      conducted and stated at 106 (xii)

          "In cases where the application is potentially to be rejected on a
          lack of genuineness  basis,  fairness  standards  may  equally  be
          satisfied be a "minded to refuse" process on the terms  identified
          in Balajigari at [55]. That is by (i) indicating  a  suspicion  of
          bad faith and particulars; (ii) giving an opportunity  to  respond
          and (iii) taking that response into account".

  76. Even, however, in cases of dishonesty, as seen from paragraphs 159  to
      160 in Balajigari it may, in some circumstances, be sufficient  if  an
      interview was conducted prior to the adverse decision.

  77. In paragraph 48 of Balajigari the reasoning of Lord Woolf MR from R  v
      Secretary of State ex parte Fayed [1998] 1 WLR 763 p 777  is  employed
      as follows:

          'I appreciate there is  also  anxiety  as  to  the  administrative
          burden  involved  in  giving   notice   of   areas   of   concern.
          Administrative convenience cannot justify unfairness, but I  would
          emphasise that my remarks are limited to cases where an  applicant
          would be in real difficulty in doing himself  justice  unless  the
          area of concern is identified by notice. In many cases  which  are
          less complex that that of the Fayeds the issues may be obvious. If
          this is the position notice may well be superfluous  because  what
          the applicant needs to establish will be clear.  If  this  is  the
          position notice may well not be required'.

  78. Pausing there, this  applicant  was  interviewed  four  times.  It  is
      evident that the applicant was aware of the general  concerns  of  the
      Entry Clearance Officer, from three previous interviews  and  refusals
      (albeit they were set aside). At the close of his interview in 2017 he
      stated that "my intention is to be a genuine businessman,  I  wish  to
      move to the UK to help my children's education, UK is a better way  of
      life for me and my family". He was aware that the genuineness  of  the
      business was in issue.

  79. The general topics of concern were raised in previous interviews  (all
      of which were evidence relevant for deciding  the  application),  when
      the applicant was legally represented and  he  knew  full  well  which
      factors might be explored. One of the key points  of  the  immigration
      rule under paragraph 245DB is that 'the  applicant  genuinely  intends
      and is able to establish, take over or become a  director  of  one  or
      more businesses in the UK within the next six months'.  The  applicant
      cannot be surprised that his proposals are being tested on that  basis
      nor that the viability or credibility of the business is at stake  and
      the applicant must  have  known  the  areas  which  would  come  under
      scrutiny.

  80. In his interview of 2017, he was specifically asked about his business
      plan and who wrote it, the location  he  had  chosen,  whom  he  would
      employ, how he would advertise the business and his potential profits.
      He also knew that the long-term planning was in issue because this was
      raised at questions 34 to 38  of  the  2017  interview.  His  previous
      employment was also in issue at question 17 of both the 2017 and  2018
      interview and indeed he gave details of his previous experience.

  81. As a genuine businessman the applicant would not need notice of  basic
      questions on basic business practice such as employment,  legislation,
      and how to deploy a marketing budget. The questions were clear and not
      obscure, and the Entry Clearance  Officer  should  not  have  to  give
      reasons for obvious and logical concerns deduced from the answers.

  82. There was criticism of the fourth  interview  as  being  replete  with
      spelling   mistakes,   typing   errors,   ellipses   and   syntactical
      difficulties  and  that  it  failed  to  allow  the  applicant  to  be
      expansive.

  83. On careful reading, however, the criticisms included in  Ms  Gherman's
      skeleton argument relate to sections where  the  applicant  was  being
      over-expansive, answering a different question from that which he  was
      asked and/or giving information which was  clearly  not  relevant.  In
      contrast with Anjum, the interview here had a structure but,  as  seen
      from the questions, was not inflexible. The content of  the  interview
      demonstrated that the Entry Clearance Officer did not  adhere  rigidly
      to a script, but asked for clarification and made spontaneous  further
      enquiries on certain  questions.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer  also
      repeated questions which were unclear or not answered. The applicant's
      responses were verbose (answers to questions 9, 11 and  14),  rambling
      (question 24) and discursive. Large sections of the answers  were  not
      even relevant (for example questions 14, 19, 32, 33).

  84.  The  applicant  was  given  ample  opportunity  to  answer  questions
      including on the business plan for example at  questions  19  and  20.
      Most of the answer to question 19 did  not  relate  to  the  question.
      Although he confirmed that he could understand and respond in English,
      his language was syntactically poor and  difficult  to  discern.  That
      theme is evident in more than one of the interviews.  For  example  in
      the interview on 16th  May  2018  the  applicant  stated  that  Exalde
      Consultancy wrote his business plan and when pressed added

          'I had to rely on online reseach for  businesses  in  the  UK  and
          after finalising the business with my cousin  Mrs  Samina  Hussain
          she has been in the Uk since 1998 and  currently  she  is  a  self
          employed  driving  instructor  ...  Then  my  input  was  business
          opportunities in the UK the casue of  my  research  regarding  the
          best opportunities in a full business there in the UK'[pic]

      That is a short example of the responses given.

  85. At one point at question 33 of  the  fourth  interview  the  applicant
      apologised for forgetting the question. At question 35, the meaning of
      the answer is clear. An interviewer's typed recording does not have to
      be perfect particularly where the recording is a challenge owing to an
      applicant's overly long and unfocussed answers. It  was  explained  at
      the outset that the Entry Clearance Officer was going to be  recording
      the interview by typing as he  interviewed.  The  applicant  indicated
      that he was content at the outset of the interview to  be  interviewed
      in English and content at the close of the interview.

  86. The Entry Clearance Officer asked  50  ranging  questions  which  were
      clear and direct and in some instances despite the circumlocuitous and
      unfocussed nature of  the  answers  repeated  the  questions.  It  was
      suggested that the dots in the interview  suggested  sections  missing
      but these appeared more to reflect natural pauses or drawing of breath
      during a long answer. Even so, the meaning of  the  answers  when  the
      question is answered is sufficiently clear and  did  not  prevent  the
      Entry Clearance Officer from examining  the  application  methodically
      and evaluating all of the evidence which the process demands  and  the
      Decision reflects. The applicant's phrasing is not precise,  but  this
      does not affect the materiality of  the  answers  the  applicant  does
      eventually give. Spelling mistakes made in the written  recording  are
      unsurprising but did not obscure the meaning of the answers.

  87. The applicant had ample opportunity to make representations on his own
      behalf  before  the  Decision  was  taken,  knew  the  scope  of   the
      Immigration Rules, had extensive  professional  help  both  legal  and
      commercial, and was asked on  several  occasions  about  his  business
      plan. It is not for the Entry Clearance Officer  to  point  out  every
      deficient answer or raise every query or point  at  the  time  of  the
      interview which needs to be considered both in part and as a whole. As
      stated in Karagul at paragraph 106 (vii), 'In general, if an applicant
      is asked questions (or  for  information)  in  the  processing  of  an
      application,  that  does  not  imply  that  the  remainder  of   their
      application is necessarily in order and is compliant ...  If  a  court
      can identify a rational reason why a decision  to  interview  or  seek
      additional material was made, it will not interfere'.

  88. The criticism of the interview recording is unsustainable.  A  careful
      reading of the responses in the various  interviews  demonstrate  that
      the  applicant's  responses  were  unstructured  and  untargeted.  The
      deficiencies in the English do not appear to be a result of  the  poor
      translation or recording but of the applicant's own language  ability.
      He confirmed he was content to be interviewed in English.

  89. An Entry  Clearance  Officer  needs  to  give  the  applicant  a  fair
      opportunity to put his case but it is for the applicant on the balance
      of probabilities to prove  that  case.  When  interviewing  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer needs to tread a line between asking  questions  and
      allowing the applicant unimpeded, as far as an interview  will  allow,
      to display his knowledge of his business and the venture proposed.  By
      its very nature the applicant should be conversant with the details of
      his business and explain that to the Entry Clearance  Officer.  It  is
      not a requirement  that  every  concern  which  occurs  to  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer, who no doubt interviews numerous applicants with  a
      wide range  of  business  proposals,  should  be  rehearsed  with  the
      applicant. That would be interminable and go beyond the principles  of
      fair procedure. The applicant was aware of the broad  issues  and  the
      applicant had ample opportunity to explain and respond appropriately.

  90. There was no procedural public law error in the conduct and  recording
      of the interview.

  91. In relation to the third  ground  and  taking  into  account  material
      evidence, it is incorrect to state that the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
      did not make even cursory reference in the refusal to the  applicant's
      previous experience. The Decision specifically states: "You were asked
      about relevant experience that you had in the food industry." The  key
      word here is 'relevant'. The Entry Clearance Officer recorded that the
      applicant had worked in the potato industry and noted that this may be
      related to the food industry but he was clearly not satisfied that the
      applicant had the relevant experience required  to  successfully  open
      and run an Italian street food franchise. It  was  also  open  to  the
      Entry Clearance Officer to state that the applicant had never  visited
      an Italian street food establishment or tasted any of  the  food  from
      Italian Wolf Street Food. This  was  an  observation  that  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer was entitled to make and his observation that  there
      was a "lack of experience in the food industry along with  a  lack  of
      knowledge of the products you propose to sell" clearly refers  to  the
      fact that the applicant does not have experience  in  running  a  fast
      food restaurant in a country which he had never visited before.  There
      was no evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the Entry  Clearance  Officer
      was also entitled to make the observation that the applicant had never
      visited  the  United  Kingdom  and  it  was  self-evidently  relevant.
      Obviously  the  applicant  could  not  visit  unlawfully  but  as   an
      observation it was correct. Many applicants  have  previously  visited
      the United Kingdom for example as students and thus this remark is not
      irrational.

  92. The applicant clearly has experience in food  technology  and  in  the
      food supply chain, but that is not experience specific to a fast  food
      restaurant. It is self-evident why extensive  academic  experience  in
      the agricultural field might not be transferable  to  this  particular
      highly competitive field of commercial activity and the  reference  to
      "the potato industry" may be terse but not inaccurate.

  93. The business plan was indeed taken into account by  the  Decision.  On
      page 2 the Decision states, "during the interview you were asked  'who
      wrote your business plan'", to which the applicant answered:

          "Yes, my inputs. My business plan the food industry growth because
          food is the basic need in every container everywhere and fast food
          industry, fast Asian food industry growth, so  I  worked  on  that
          market  potential  and  therefore  after  getting  in  touch   the
          different companies like I told you, McDonald's, and Subway,  when
          I could not fulfil their requirement of coming there  and  signing
          their agreement of our rent ... Nine months of trainings."

      The applicant clearly understands  the  question  and  generously  the
      Entry Clearance  Officer  has  omitted  from  the  Decision  that  the
      applicant in fact states "I have not put any inputs there in  business
      plan". The remainder of the answer  was  effectively  irrelevant.  The
      Entry Clearance Officer sets out, however, rationally that he was  not
      satisfied as to the contributions the applicant made to  the  business
      plan and this cast doubt on the genuineness  of  the  application.  As
      stated above there was, however, no definitive finding of  dishonesty.
      At the close of the answer the applicant states "and  all  discussions
      remain on telephone,  WhatsApp,  email  and  they  also  gave  me  the
      business plan on the basis of last twelve months of turnover of  their
      first business unit of Chiswick."

  94. Thus, to the question "who wrote your business plan and what input did
      you have in the business plan?" the answer shows the applicant  wasted
      the opportunity in his response. Nevertheless, this demonstrates  that
      the Decision maker contemplated the business plan for the Decision and
      explored the plan extensively during the interview. The business  plan
      and the applicant's future plans (which were  indeed  uncertain)  were
      both referenced adequately in the Decision. When the applicant  stated
      'no one's plan is final till ever, we can change, we can  brand  mix',
      the Entry Clearance Officer was rationally entitled to conclude 'I  do
      not find that a genuine entrepreneur would invest over  �200,000  with
      no clear plans for the future'. I employ  the  reasoning  given  above
      with reference to 'genuine entrepreneur' as  being  'credible'  rather
      than 'dishonest'[pic]

  95. The Entry Clearance Officer  made  reference  to  the  fact  that  the
      respondent was concerned that the applicant had not  done  any  recent
      research regarding the location of his business and also had  concerns
      about applicant's approach to the marketing budget, stating:

          "When asked how you will spend the �200,000 you  did  not  mention
          any of the funds being used towards marketing however at interview
          you stated that  �70,000  over  three  years  would  be  spent  on
          marketing. It is expected that a  genuine  entrepreneur  would  be
          able to talk about how they propose to spend their funds  and  how
          they will use them to aid the business."

  96. That was an entirely rational observation which  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer was entitled to make.  The  applicant  clearly  had  no  clear
      understanding of how the funds were going to be used even to the point
      he had not identified in fact that there  was  a  discrepancy  on  the
      marketing budget within the business plan itself. The  respondent  was
      unarguably entitled to conclude that the applicant in his answers  had
      failed to set out how his marketing budget would be  applied  to  help
      his business or explain how net revenue could be tapped initially  for
      that purpose.

  97. Overall, it is clear the Entry Clearance Officer took into account the
      contents of the business plan, which formed a substantial part of  the
      basis  for  questioning  of  the  applicant  in   interview   and   is
      specifically referred to. The Entry Clearance Officer .referred to the
      key documentation in the Decision and there is no indication  that  he
      failed to take into account relevant evidence. It is obvious  why  the
      interview would feature so prominently  in  the  Decision  because  it
      reflects the applicant's understanding of his putative business.

  98. With reference to the second ground,  rationality,  when  reading  the
      decision as a whole the respondent was unarguably  entitled  to  reach
      the conclusion that the applicant's application should be refused. The
      relevant immigration rule  was  lawfully  applied.  The  decision  was
      within the range of reasonable responses that the application was  not
      viable. I employ my reasoning above which has explored various  issues
      in detail. There was no clarity on the long-term plans,  no  knowledge
      of the UK employment legislation which is critical, and the  applicant
      had not had relevant experience. He had  general  experience  on  food
      matters, but the Entry Clearance  Officer  was  entitled  to  conclude
      these would not transfer. The Secretary of State  was  asking  whether
      the applicant was genuine  such  that  the  business  was  viable  and
      credible, and it was  on  that  basis  that  the  rationality  of  the
      decision should be considered. The Entry Clearance  Officer  does  not
      need to refer to every piece of evidence but that said, in conjunction
      with the business plan, key elements of the applicant's knowledge  and
      business understanding were highlighted in  the  interview  and  fatal
      such as the contribution to and discussion of the business  plan,  and
      the lack of knowledge of the basic employment legislation such as  the
      minimum  wage.  These  are  basic  questions  that  any   entrepreneur
      establishing in the United Kingdom should be able to  answer.  Bearing
      in mind that the applicant had explained in his application  that  his
      role of the applicant was that of Chief Executive Officer his lack  of
      knowledge was even more surprising.

  99. As the Decision observes, the interview clearly  revealed  a  lack  of
      input into  the  business  plan  and  vagueness.  The  circuitous  and
      vagueness of the  responses  given  to  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
      unarguably entitled the  Entry  Clearance  Officers  to  place  little
      weight on the evidence that the  applicant  wished  to  specialise  in
      Italian street food. That the submissions assert the  applicant  is  a
      genuine business entrepreneur does not address the  difficulties  with
      the interview and the Entry Clearance Officer was  entitled  to  treat
      the  interviews  (of  which  there  were  four)  as   fundamental   in
      demonstrating whether the applicant was able to establish  a  business
      in the United Kingdom within six months or indeed at all.

 100. The fact that he had spent two and a half years on an application does
      not in itself make the application  viable  and  the  Entry  Clearance
      Officer was unarguably entitled to take into account the applicant had
      no  prior  experience  of  running  a  street  food   franchise.   The
      immigration rule under  consideration  here  employs  the  conjunctive
      'and' between 'genuinely intends' and  'is  able  to  establish'  Both
      limbs need to be fulfilled.

 101. This is a  business  that  the  applicant  himself  was  intending  to
      establish and run; it was unarguably rational for the Entry  Clearance
      Officer whilst acknowledging that the application had been ongoing for
      sometime, to find that relying on  very  dated  statistics  from  well
      before the date of the application did not demonstrate expected recent
      research. Understably rationally, the Entry  Clearance  Officer  would
      have expected the applicant to be able to talk  in  detail  about  his
      application but the applicant did not despite the  opportunity.  On  a
      range of matters from the broader issues such as the business plan and
      future plans, to the finer  detail  such  as  property  location,  and
      employwment legislation the  applicant  did  not  demonstrate  he  had
      properly researched or continued to explore the issues himself  rather
      relying on the Wolf Franchisors.

 102. As set out in the Pre-Action Protocol response 'it is  not  irrational
      to assume an applicant, knowlingly investing �200,000 into a business,
      would have more concrete knowledge  of  their  future  plans  for  the
      business rather than display such a degree of uncertainty'.

 103. The Entry Clearance Officer in the Decision stated  that  he  was  not
      satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the  business  plan  or
      intentions were viable and credible and the conclusions in the refusal
      were rational for the reasons given. It should be underlined that  the
      Decision emanates from an evaluative assessment of the application and
      the immigration  rule,  which  is  publicised,  demands  a  prognostic
      examination of the proposed  business.  The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
      applied the relevant immigration rules,  administered  a  procedurally
      fair interview and took into  account  relevant  evidence.  The  Entry
      Clearance Officer was unarguably entitled to  refuse  the  application
      under paragraph 245DB(f).

 104. The application is refused. ~~~0~~~~

Notification of appeal rights





A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.





A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).





If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
