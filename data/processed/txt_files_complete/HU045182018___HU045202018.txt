For the Appellant:     Mr S Kotas of the Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondents:   Mr G Davidson of Counsel instructed by Elegant
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondents

 1. The Respondents, Promila Devi and Shyam Sood are wife and husband.   He
    claims as  her  dependent.   They  are  both  citizens  of  India  born
    respectively in 1980 and 1983.  I shall refer to the lead Respondent as
    "the Applicant."

 2. The Applicant arrived on 26 September 2006 with leave  to  enter  as  a
    student which was subsequently extended and then further leave a Tier 1
    (Post-Study) Migrant was granted and also  extended  to  expire  on  20
    August 2016.  On 18 August 2016 she applied  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain based on ten years' lawful residence in the United Kingdom  with
    her husband as her dependent.

 3. They have minor children, the eldest of whom was born in 2013.   On  26
    January  2018  the  Appellant  (the  SSHD)  refused   the   Applicant's
    application and on 7 February 2018 refused her  husband's  application.
    He was refused as her partner because she  had  been  refused  and  his
    claim based on his private and family life was  refused  for  the  same
    reasons as the Applicant was refused.

The SSHD's Original Decisions

 4. The Applicant was refused by way of reference  to  para.322(5)  of  the
    Immigration Rules on the  ground  that  the  Respondent  considered  it
    undesirable to permit her to remain in the United Kingdom in the  light
    of her conduct.

 5. The conduct in issue was, first that there was  a  discrepancy  between
    the income of �14,987 which the Applicant had declared to HM Revenue  &
    Customs (HMRC) for the year ending 5  April  2011  and  the  income  of
    �55,653.13 declared to the SSHD for purposes  of  her  application  for
    further leave to remain  made  on  4  April  2011.  The  Applicant  had
    corrected her 2011 tax return resulting in a revised calculation on  23
    May 2016.  The additional tax due had been paid.

    The SSHD also considered second that there was  a  discrepancy  between
    her income of �16,957 declared to HMRC for the year ending 5 April 2013
    and the income of �55,843.19 declared to the SSHD  in  her  application
    for further leave of 24 June 2013.

    For the same reasons, the Applicant was unable to meet the requirements
    of para.276B(iii) of the Immigration Rules.

 6. The SSHD  considered  the  Applicant's  private  and  family  life  and
    concluded that on return to India she would not face undue hardship  in
    re-integrating and there were no compassionate factors to  warrant  the
    grant of leave outside the Immigration Rules.

 7. On 9 February 2018 the Applicant and  her  husband  lodged  notices  of
    appeal under s.82 Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as
    amended (the 2002 Act).  The grounds are that  the  Applicant  has  not
    been deceitful or dishonest in her dealings with HMRC and has paid  tax
    on all her taxable income and there is no public interest requiring her
    removal.  The grounds also allege the SSHD had not taken properly  into
    account the interests of the child of the marriage and additionally the
    Applicant and her husband came from families with  different  religious
    beliefs, a matter not mentioned in the statements of the Applicant  and
    her husband.





Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 8. By a decision promulgated on 24 September 2018 Judge of the  First-tier
    Tribunal Ford found in favour of the Applicant that para.322(5) of  the
    Immigration Rules was not applicable and allowed the  appeal  on  human
    rights grounds.

 9. The SSHD sought permission to appeal on the basis it was  arguable  the
    Judge had erred in law in her consideration  of  parar.322(5)  and  had
    failed to give adequate reasons why the late declaration of  income  to
    HMRC amounted to innocent mistake.  On 16 October  2018  Judge  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Foudy granted permission to appeal.

Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. I was informed that the Applicant and her husband were in  Field  House
    but were outside the hearing room with their young  children  and  were
    content not to be present.  Mr Davison agreed there was no need for any
    anonymity direction and that the direction  previously  made  could  be
    lifted.

Submissions for the SSHD

11. Mr Kotas relied on the grounds for appeal that the decision of the HMRC
    neither to impose penalties nor treat the Applicant's various  failings
    in respect to supply accurate information in her  tax  returns  as  tax
    evasion did not mean  the  Respondent  was  barred  from  invoking  the
    provisions of para.322(5) of the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Judge  had
    erred in assuming that it was sufficient.  He relied on the extract  in
    the grounds taken from para.75 of Abbasi JR/13807/2016 and the headnote
    to the judgment in R (Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax  return,  paragraph
    322(5)) [2018] UKUT 384 (IAC).  The Judge had not considered the  facts
    and had nevertheless made an assessment whether the Applicant had  been
    dishonest.  He had materially mis-directed  himself  and  the  decision
    should be set aside.

Submissions for the Applicant

12. Mr Davison accepted that in the Applicant's  circumstances  para.322(5)
    of the  Immigration  Rules  might  be  applicable.   However,  in  this
    particular case the Judge had made findings at paras.26 and 29  of  his
    judgment that there was no evidence the Applicant  had  supplied  false
    figures, having sought to amend a tax return  and  rectify  any  under-
    payment of income tax.

13. The Judge had found there was no evidence to  show  the  Appellant  had
    given false figures to the SSHD in her applications for further  leave.
    There was evidence at page 34 of the Appellant's Bundle  that  she  had
    paid tax on all of the earnings identified at the foot of page 3 of the
    SSHD's reasons for refusal.  The Applicant had not  avoided  or  evaded
    any tax liability or been dishonest in her dealings with HMRC.

14. I indicated that I did not need to hear a response  on  behalf  of  the
    SSHD.



Findings and Consideration

15. Mr Davison for the Applicant quite rightly  accepted  that  para.322(5)
    could apply but submitted that in the Applicant's circumstances it  was
    not applicable.  The Judge found that it was not applicable because  he
    considered the evidence showed that the Applicant had  not  avoided  or
    evaded any tax liability.  He did not assess  whether  the  Applicant's
    failure to supply accurate figures  for  three  consecutive  tax  terms
    ending on 5 April 2013  constituted  conduct  or  character  making  it
    undesirable to permit the Applicant to remain in the United Kingdom  or
    otherwise unsuitable for the grant of further leave with  reference  to
    Appendix FM.  He did not address the Applicant's delay in amending  her
    tax returns and her explanation for it which from paragraph 23  of  his
    decision would appear to amount to not following the  advice  given  to
    her by her then accountant.

16. The Judge's treatment of the issue whether the Applicant had used false
    figures in her applications to the SSHD for further leave to remain  is
    brief.  At paragraph 29 he referred to the Respondent's allegation that
    the  Applicant  had  given  false  figures  for  her  income   in   her
    applications for further leave.  Given the initial apparent discrepancy
    in the figures given by the Applicant to  HMRC,  the  Judge  needed  to
    address the legal and evidential burdens of proof which he did not.

17. Given the concerns the SSHD had about the  Applicant's  disclosures  to
    HMRC there was reason to query the figures the Applicant  had  used  in
    her further leave applications.

18. The evidential requirements in connection with Tier 1 (General) Migrant
    applications were relaxed until changes to the Immigration Rules  on  6
    April 2015.  The SSHD's concerns about the weight which could be  given
    to representations by the Applicant  of  her  income  were  justifiably
    raised and at that  point  the  obligation  was  on  the  Applicant  to
    evidence to show that her declaration to the SSHD  of  her  income  was
    accurate.  The Judge noted there was no evidence to support the  income
    figures used in the further leave applications and in this  light,  the
    Judge's treatment of this aspect of the reason of the  SSHD's  original
    decision was in error.

19. For these reasons the decision cannot stand  and  is  set  aside.   The
    appeal will need to  be  heard  afresh  and  in  the  circumstances,  I
    consider the safest course be to direct that no findings  of  fact  are
    preserved.

20. The Applicant's evidence  is  not  sufficiently  complete  properly  to
    establish how much she earned in the periods relevant  to  her  further
    leave applications of 2011 and 2013.  The issue of the declarations  to
    SSHD of her income is an essential part of the reasons for  the  SSHD's
    refusal to grant indefinite leave. Having regard to the extent  of  the
    evidence which would need to be considered and the findings of fact  to
    be made thereon, it is appropriate to  remit  the  appeal  for  hearing
    afresh to the First-tier Tribunal.



Anonymity

21. The anonymity direction  previously  made  is  not  necessary  and  the
    Appellant and the Applicant agreed it may be lifted.

Directions

22. For the rehearing in addition to any directions  which  the  First-tier
    Tribunal may make, the Applicant is  directed  to  produce  documentary
    evidence to show receipt by her of the income declared to SSHD  in  her
    2011 and 2013 applications for further leave by  way  of  reference  to
    personal bank statements as well as payslips, company accounts and bank
    statements and to produce a schema to  enable  the  Judge  readily  and
    quickly to identify the claimed receipts.

23. The attention of the parties is  drawn  to  the  judgments  in  Russell
    Dadzie, Rhoda Parker-Wilson v SSHD [2018] CSOH 128 and R (Khan) v  SSHD
    (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained errors of law and  is
    set aside.

    The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  for  hearing  afresh
    with no findings of fact preserved.

    No anonymity direction.
