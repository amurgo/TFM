Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Aslam
For the Respondent:    Mr McVeety, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a female citizen of  Pakistan  who  was  born  on  1st
    January, 1987.  She is  married  to  the  sponsor,  Sajiid  Rasool  and
    applied for entry clearance as his wife.

2.   On 21st November, 2012, the respondent refused  the  appellant's  entry
    clearance application under  paragraph  EC-P31(d)  of  Appendix  FM  of
    Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules, HC  395,  as  amended  ("the
    Immigration  Rules").   The  respondent  referred  to   the   documents
    specified in the Immigration Rules at Appendix FM-SE  and  refused  the
    appellant's application, because the appellant had  not  submitted  all
    the required documentation to demonstrate her sponsor's income  was  as
    claimed.

3.   The appellant appealed and her appeal was heard by First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Brookfield who, in a determination promulgated on  6th  November,
    2013, allowed the appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules.

4.   The judge also made a fee award of ï¿½140.

5.   The respondent challenged the decision of the judge,  noting  that  the
    judge had calculated the sponsor's gross annual income, as at the  date
    of the Entry Clearance Officer's decision.  However, the grounds  point
    out that Appendices FM and FM-SE make it clear that the  relevant  date
    to be considered is not the date  of  the  decision  but  the  date  of
    application.   Evidence  relating  to  the  sponsor's  employment   and
    evidence of his gross annual income needed to date from May 2012.   The
    judge went on to consider post-application and  post-decision  evidence
    at paragraph 9(v) of her determination, which was not permissible under
    the Immigration Rules.

6.   The respondent's application referred to the date  of  the  application
    being 21st November, 2012, whereas, of  course,  it  is  actually  30th
    September,  2012.   This  is  clear  from  the  copy  of  the   printed
    application which appeared in the respondent's bundle.

7.   I heard submissions from Mr  McVeety,  who  explained  that  since  the
    required documents had not been  provided  with  the  application,  the
    Entry Clearance Officer had refused it.  Subsequently,  documents  were
    submitted by the appellant with his grounds of appeal but,  he  pointed
    out, these were not admissible and should not have been  considered  by
    the judge.

8.   For  the  appellant,  Mr  Aslam  confirmed  that  the  application  was
    submitted  online  by  the  appellant  on  30th  September,  2009.   He
    confirmed that the appellant did not  provide  any  P60,  nor  did  she
    provide wage slips for the sponsor for the six month  period  prior  to
    the date of the application.  In fact, Mr Aslam agreed, the wage  slips
    provided for the sponsor were between 9th July and 1st October.

9.   Mr Aslam pointed out that  the  sponsor  had  provided  a  contract  of
    employment, but agreed that this had actually  been  submitted  by  the
    appellant with the Notice of Appeal and not with the application.

10.  Mr  Aslam  also  pointed  out  that  the  appellant  did  provide  bank
    statements, but these also appear to be for  a  period  less  than  six
    months prior to the date of the  application  and  were  only  for  the
    period 22nd June to 21st September, 2012.

11.  I referred Mr Aslam to the Entry Clearance Officer's  decision  and  to
    the  documents  required  to  be  submitted  with  the  application  in
    accordance with EC-P1.1(d) of Appendix FM.  He agreed that neither  the
    appellant nor the sponsor had submitted a P60 with the application, nor
    the specified  wage  slips,  nor  with  a  letter  from  the  sponsor's
    employer, nor with a copy of the signed  contract  of  employment,  nor
    with the required personal monthly bank statements.

12.  As a result, Mr Aslam agreed that the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
    made errors of law and that  the  appellant's  appeal  could  not  have
    succeeded, because the appellant had failed to discharge the burden  on
    her to show that on a balance of probabilities she met the requirements
    of the Immigration Rules.

13.  I am satisfied that the decision of the First Tier Tribunal Judge  does
    contain an error on a point of law.  I set aside the decision of First-
    tier  Tribunal  Brookfield  and  remake  the  decision   myself.    The
    appellant's appeal is dismissed.  I make no fee award.
