   DECISION PURSUANT TO RULE 39 OF THE TRIBUNAL PROCEDURE (UPPER TRIBUNAL)
                                 RULES 2008

 1. The appellants are wife and husband, respectively,  and  the  remaining
    appellants are their children. They appealed to the First-tier Tribunal
    ("FtT) against decisions to refuse leave to remain and a  'section  47'
    removal in respect of the first appellant,  and  'section  10'  removal
    decisions in respect of the other appellants. First-tier Tribunal judge
    Meah ("the FtJ") dismissed their appeals after  a  hearing  on  12  May
    2015.

 2. Permission to appeal against  the  decision  of  the  FtJ  having  been
    granted, their appeals came before Deputy Upper Tribunal  Judge  O'Ryan
    ("the DUTJ") on 22 December 2015. He found  an  error  of  law  in  the
    decision of the FtT and set the decision aside for the decision  to  be
    re-made in the Upper Tribunal.

 3. There was a further hearing before the DUTJ on 25 May  2016  which  was
    for the re-making of the decision. Unfortunately, the DUTJ was not able
    to complete his decision on the re-making within a reasonable time, and
    the appeals were therefore  made  the  subject  of  a  transfer  order,
    resulting in the hearing before us as  above.  It  was  agreed  by  the
    parties before us that the DUTJ had  not  given  his  decision  on  the
    appeals at the hearing on 25 May 2016.

 4. It was also agreed between the parties before us that, by consent,  the
    appeals in the case of each appellant should be allowed.  Having  heard
    the parties on the issue, and  considering  rule  39  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, we make a consent order allowing
    the appeal of each appellant, considering it appropriate to do so.  The
    consent order is as contained in this paragraph, no  separate  document
    being required.

 5. The parties further agreed that it may be  recorded  in  this  decision
    that the Secretary of State will consider the appellants'  applications
    afresh, and that the 's.120 notice' dated  14  December  2016  will  be
    considered in the new decisions that will be made.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Although it has not previously been thought  appropriate  for  an  anonymity
order to be made, because of the ages of the minor  appellants  we  consider
that such an order is appropriate. Therefore, unless and  until  a  Tribunal
or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellants  are  granted  anonymity.   No
report of these proceedings shall directly or indirectly  identify  them  or
any member of their family. This direction applies both  to  the  appellants
and to the respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could lead  to
contempt of court proceedings.


Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek                            14/12/16
