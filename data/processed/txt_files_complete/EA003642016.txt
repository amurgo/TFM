               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr W Malik, Solicitor instructed by WH Malik
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  He seeks to appeal  against  a
    decision dated 3 December 2015 refusing to grant him an  EEA  residence
    card.  For the purposes of such an appeal he is to be  regarded  as  an
    extended family member.

2.   The appeal came before Upper Tribunal Judge Martin, sitting as a  judge
    of the First-tier Tribunal, on 4 May 2017.  At that time  the  decision
    in Sala (EFMs: right of appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411  (IAC)  was  then  in
    existence.  That provided that there was no  right  of  appeal  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for that category of member.  Thus it was that  the
    appeal was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.

3.   The situation has now changed in that the decision  of  Sala  has  been
    overtaken by the decision in Khan v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.  Thus it
    would  appear  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  does  indeed  have  the
    jurisdiction to determine such appeals.

4.   In the circumstances the decision of Tribunal  Judge  Martin  shall  be
    set aside and the matter  sent  back  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the merits of the appeal.  It  will  be  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in those circumstances to give any such directions for hearing
    as it may determine.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed to the extent  that  there  is  to  be  a  substantive
hearing.

No anonymity direction is made.
