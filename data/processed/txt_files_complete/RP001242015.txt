                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mrs R Petersen, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr S Tetley, Counsel, instructed by Howells
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.    The  appellant  (hereafter  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
    Department or SSHD) has permission to challenge the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge Place allowing the appeal of  the  respondent
    (hereafter the claimant) against the  decision  by  the  SSHD  dated  9
    October 2015 to revoke his refugee status and  to  make  a  deportation
    order against him.

2.   The challenge of the  SSHD  is  confined  to  one  issue  only,  namely
    whether it was an error of the judge to have failed to consider s.72 of
    the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002.   The  grounds  draw
    attention to the fact that the claimant was served on  5  January  2009
    with a s. 72 notice.

3.   The fatal difficulty for the grounds of  challenge  is  that  the  SSHD
    never proceeded to issue a s.72 certificate or at least she has  failed
    to show that she took any action in respect of the  s.72  notice  which
    she sent in January 2009, even though the claimant  duly  responded  to
    the questions posed by that notice (whether the  SSHD  chooses  in  the
    future to issue a s.72 certificate is not a matter for this Tribunal).

Notice of Decision

4.   In such circumstances the  SSHD  cannot  make  out  her  challenge  and
    accordingly the decision of the FtT judge must stand.

    No anonymity direction is made.
