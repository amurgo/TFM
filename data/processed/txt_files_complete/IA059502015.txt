                            DECISION AND REASONS


The Appellant

 1. The Appellant, Syed Wasim Abbas, is a citizen of Pakistan  born  on  15
    December 1988.  The Tribunal file contains  limited  information  about
    his immigration history.  It appears that following a successful appeal
    to what is now the First-tier Tribunal on 14 May 2009 he  entered  with
    leave as a student expiring on 31 August 2010.   The  latest  grant  of
    leave was the issue of a Residence  Card  as  the  husband  of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty Rights in the United  Kingdom  issued  on  9
    November 2011 to expire on 9 November 2016.

 2. The Residence Card was issued on the basis that on 13 December 2010 the
    Appellant had married Vaida Barcauskiene, a Lithuanian national born on
    13 May 1977, a person exercising Treaty Rights in the United Kingdom.

 3. On 25 January 2015 the Appellant returned to the  United  Kingdom  from
    Pakistan, having been out of  the  country  for  about  25  days.   The
    Respondent made enquiries and interviewed the Appellant and his wife on
    25 January 2015 and  the  Appellant  again  on  9  February  2015.  The
    Respondent then refused the Appellant admission under Regulation 11  of
    the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006 as amended and proposed to  make
    directions pursuant to Regulation 23for his removal  to  Pakistan.   In
    the notice of decision, the Respondent considered that the  Appellant's
    wife was "not currently in the United Kingdom" and that she was  not  a
    qualified person within the meaning of Regulation 6 of  the  2006  Regs
    because despite claims of having been almost  continually  employed  in
    the United Kingdom since 2009 the Respondent was unable  to  trace  any
    details of her in the United Kingdom tax or national insurance records.



 4. The Respondent went on to prepare a lengthy explanatory statement which
    is dated  16  May  2015.   This  sets  out  events  subsequent  to  the
    Appellant's arrival and details of what he and his  wife  had  said  at
    interview.

The Original Appeal

 5. On 14 February 2015 the Appellant through his  then  solicitors  lodged
    notice of appeal under Regulation 26 and Section 82 of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act).  The grounds
    assert that the Respondent's decision does not comply with "common  law
    requirements of fairness" and is "Wednesbury unreasonable" and that the
    Respondent did not exercise her discretion in favour of  the  Appellant
    and had applied "the Rules ... so strictly ... that it has  defied  the
    ends of justice".  Further, the grounds refer to Regulation  10(5)  and
    Article 8 of the European Convention.

The First-tier Tribunal Proceedings

 6. On 18 March 2015 the First-tier Tribunal gave notice to  the  Appellant
    and his then solicitors that the  appeal  was  set  for  hearing  on  4
    September  2015.   The  Tribunal   file   discloses   that   the   next
    communication with the Tribunal from the Appellant  or  his  solicitors
    was a fax sent at 11:09 a.m. on 3  September  2015  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal enclosing a Statutory Sick Pay Certificate  stating  that  the
    Appellant was not fit for work because he had seen  the  doctor  on  28
    August 2015 suffering from injuries to his  low  back  and  right  knee
    following a fall  from  his  bicycle.   The  solicitors  requested  the
    hearing be  adjourned.   The  adjournment  application  was  made  late
    contrary to the provisions of Practice Direction  9  which  require  at
    least one clear working day's notice.  Practice Direction 9.4 states:-

         Any application made later than the end of the period mentioned  in
         paragraph 9.1 must be made to the Tribunal at the hearing and  will
         require the attendance of the party or the  representative  of  the
         party seeking the adjournment.

    It appears that the fax of 3 September was not before the  judge  on  4
    September when he received the file.  There was no appearance by or for
    the Appellant and the Respondent had agreed that the  appeal  could  be
    decided without representation for the Respondent.

 7. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Whalan decided the  appeal  without  a
    hearing and on the basis of the documents in the Tribunal file.   By  a
    decision promulgated on 29 September 2015 he dismissed the  Appellant's
    appeal on all grounds.

 8. On 25 February 2016 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Colyer granted the
    Appellant permission to appeal on the basis that the judge  had  failed
    to mention the  Appellant's  application  for  an  adjournment  of  the
    hearing on medical grounds and that although the Judge  had  found  the
    Appellant  had  failed  to  file  any   additional   documentation   or
    submissions he claimed he had submitted all the relevant  documents  to
    his then solicitors for filing with the Tribunal and the Appellant  did
    not know why they had not been filed.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

 9. On 21 March 2016 the Appellant's current  solicitors  filed  a  bundle.
    This is  the  only  Appellant's  bundle  in  the  Tribunal  file.   The
    Appellant  attended  the  hearing  but  took  no  active  part  in  the
    proceedings other than to confirm his present address.

10. At the start of the hearing I enquired whether  having  regard  to  the
    terms of the Respondent's decision to refuse admission, the sole  issue
    raised in the original appeal was whether the Appellant's  wife  was  a
    qualified person within  the  meaning  of  Regulation  6.   Mr  Balroop
    informed me that the  Appellant's  wife  would  not  be  attending  the
    hearing.  I referred to the grounds for permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal.   Mr  Balroop  properly  accepted  that  there  was  no
    evidence to support the claims made in  the  grounds  relating  to  the
    failure of the Appellant or his then solicitors to file a bundle in the
    First-tier Tribunal or evidence to show that the Appellant had in  fact
    supplied the relevant documents to his solicitors.

11. I informed the parties with reference to grounds 6 and  7  relating  to
    the failure of the Appellant or his solicitors to  attend  the  hearing
    that the Tribunal file indicated that the solicitors' letter requesting
    a medical adjournment was not before the Judge.

12. The remaining ground 8 refers to the  Respondent's  decision  being  in
    breach of his obligations under Article 8 of the European Convention to
    respect the Appellant's private and family life are in  generic  terms.
    I noted the grounds for appeal to the Upper Tribunal did  not  in  fact
    challenge the Judge's decision to dismiss the Appellant's appeal  under
    the 2006 Regs.  In any event, I enquired what evidence there was before
    me to show the Appellant's wife  was  a  qualified  person  within  the
    meaning of Reg 6.  I considered the wife's statement of 18  March  2016
    by itself did not address the issue of her exercise of Treaty Rights in
    the United Kingdom and hence her status as a  qualified  person  within
    the meaning of Regulation 6.

13. Mr Balroop took the opportunity to seek instructions from the Appellant
    and confirmed the Appellant wished to proceed.

14. Mr Balroop for the Appellant submitted  that  his  previous  solicitors
    were supposed to have filed a bundle to support  the  Appellant's  case
    and their failure so  to  do  had  the  consequence  that  the  Judge's
    decision was made in breach of the principles of natural justice.   The
    Appellant had fallen off his bicycle on 28 August and it was  only  six
    days later (bank holiday intervening) that his solicitors had requested
    an adjournment on medical grounds.  I indicated that it was established
    practice in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  adjournments  on  medical
    grounds were  not  customarily  granted  on  the  evidence  of  only  a
    Statutory Sick Pay Certificate.  The expectation was that  there  would
    be a medical certificate explaining expressly  that  the  Appellant  or
    witness was not fit to attend court.

15. Mr Balroop said it would not be possible for a Tribunal to  decide  the
    appeal without hearing from both the Appellant and his wife.  This  was
    a procedural unfairness which amounted to a material error of law.  The
    decision should be set aside.

16. For the Respondent Mr Avery submitted there was no error of  law.   The
    request  for  an  adjournment  had  been  made  late.   The   documents
    supporting the adjournment application were inadequate.  There  was  no
    evidence to support the allegations made by the Appellant  against  his
    previous solicitors and the evidence submitted did not  show  that  the
    Appellant had an established private life in the United Kingdom, nor an
    established family life.  The Appellant had had ample  time  to  obtain
    the necessary documentation to establish his claim under the 2006  Regs
    and had failed so to do.  The decision should stand.

Error of Law

17. I informed the parties that my initial view was that there was no error
    of law in the Judge's decision such that it  should  be  set  aside  in
    whole or in part.  I noted that for whatever  reason,  the  Appellant's
    appeal had been decided in the First-tier Tribunal without  a  judicial
    consideration of the documents which had been filed for  the  Appellant
    on 21 March 2016 for the Upper Tribunal hearing, albeit  there  was  no
    proper explanation why the documents had not previously been filed  and
    served.  I agreed that in such circumstances the Appellant should  have
    the benefit of a judicial consideration of the documents which had been
    filed. I would therefore hear submissions on the substantive appeal.

18. Mr Balroop referred me to the statements  for  the  Appellant's  wife's
    bank account for the period November 2010  -  July  2010  which  showed
    regular payment of salary and subsequently what was said to be earnings
    from her self-employment as a cleaner.  The latter was supported by her
    contract with Naz Foods UK Ltd and Forever Provision Ltd at  pages  183
    following and 187 following of  the  Appellant's  bundle.   These  were
    unsigned by any party and specified merely a rate of hourly payment  of
    �7.75 but contained no indication of the minimum  number  of  hours  of
    cleaning services the Appellant was to supply.

19. Mr Balroop referred me to the witness statement made  by  a  Revenue  &
    Customs officer on 14 April 2015 at  Appendix  I  to  the  Respondent's
    bundle.  I noted this showed that notwithstanding the appearance in the
    Appellant's bundle of copies of tax returns by the Appellant's wife for
    the years 2011/12 - 2014/15, she had not filed any tax returns for  the
    years 2011/12 - 2013/14.  The statement was of course  prepared  before
    the 2014/15 return would in the  normal  course  of  events  have  been
    filed.  It also recorded there was no evidence of any  employment  held
    by the Appellant's wife for the years 2009/10 - 2014/15  and  that  she
    had commenced employment at Aden Ltd on 11 March 2015.  It also  showed
    that the Appellant recorded self-employed earnings as a domestic worker
    and cleaner for 2010/11 of �6,613 on a turnover of �11,070.  There were
    no details of why the profit margin was so low.

20. He referred me to the letter at page 92 of the Appellant's bundle  from
    the wife's accountants.  This simply states she is a client of the firm
    and "is a self-employed Domestic & Commercial Cleaner".  The letter  is
    dated  8  March  2016  and  gives  no  other  details.   There  was  no
    explanation how the Appellant was both self-employed and in  employment
    as disclosed in the Revenue & Customs' statement of 14 April 2015.   Mr
    Balroop stated the Appellant had informed him that his  wife's  records
    and invoice books were at home.  He  properly  accepted  there  was  no
    documentary evidence to show that the Appellant's wife  was  exercising
    Treaty Rights by way of information issued by Revenue & Customs such as
    tax assessments or bank statements.

21. Mr Avery submitted the Appellant's wife had been in Lithuania since  21
    January 2015 on account of her sister's illness and the  Appellant  had
    no case.  There were no recent  bank  statements  for  the  Appellant's
    wife.  She had been interviewed over the telephone on 25 January  2015.
    There was no evidence to show the Appellant's wife was  in  the  United
    Kingdom. On the Appellant's own evidence she had not for some time been
    present in the United Kingdom.

Findings and Consideration

22. Judge Whalan dismissed the Appellant's appeal because he had failed  to
    file or serve any additional evidence, documentation or submissions  in
    support of his appeal and failed completely to attempt to discharge the
    burden of proof: see paragraph 8  of  his  decision.   The  Appellant's
    claim was unsupported by any evidence other than his bare assertion  at
    paragraph 8 of his statement of 18 March 2016 at  pages  19-22  of  the
    Appellant's bundle.

23.  Both  representatives  accepted  that  the  material  issue   of   the
    substantive appeal is whether  the  Appellant's  wife  is  a  qualified
    person within the meaning of Regulation  6.   Notwithstanding  the  224
    pages of  the  Appellant's  bundle  there  is  nothing  in  the  bundle
    sufficient on the balance of probabilities to show that at the date  of
    the decision or at the date of the hearing the Appellant's wife  was  a
    qualified person.

24. The Appellant failed to discharge the burden of proof on  him  to  show
    his wife is a qualified person.  Therefore even if  there  is  a  valid
    natural justice point to  be  raised  in  relation  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal proceedings, there is no reason  to  set  aside  the  decision
    because it contains no material error of law such that  if  the  matter
    were re-heard there is  any  reasonable  prospect  that  a  differently
    constituted  Tribunal  would  come   to   any   different   conclusion.
    Consequently, the First-tier Tribunal determination did not contain  an
    error of law such that it should be set aside and it shall stand.

Anonymity

25. There was no request for an anonymity direction and I  do  not  consider
    one is warranted.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal shall stand.
    No anonymity direction is made.
