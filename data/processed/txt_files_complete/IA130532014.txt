                           AYOMIDE VIVIAN AGBOOLA
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                 NOTICE OF ABANDONMENT PURSUANT TO RULE 17A

                                 AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Nigeria who  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 27 June 2013.
    That appeal was heard  together  with  those  of  her  mother,  Olubunmi
    Olumide-Agboola   (IA/13032/2014),   father   Akanni   Ezekial   Agboola
    (IA/13052/20140 and sister, Favour Opeyemi Agboola (IA/13054/2014).

 2. The  First-tier  Tribunal  dismissed  the  appeals  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 10 February 2015

 3. By way of a  letter  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  dated  11  May  2015  the
    appellant's representative states that the appellant  has  been  granted
    leave to remain in the United Kingdom.

 4. Accordingly, I am satisfied that  section 104 (4A) of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 applies and that pursuant to  rules  17A
    (1) and (2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Procedure  Rules
    2008 the Upper Tribunal must therefore issue a notice pursuant  to  rule
    17 A (2) informing the parties that  the  appeal  is  being  treated  as
    abandoned. This is a Notice pursuant to  rule  17A  (2)  to  inform  the
    parties that the respondent's case is deemed abandoned.

 5. The effect of the respondent's case being deemed abandoned is  that  the
    proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at an end.  For the  avoidance
    of doubt, it made clear that  the  appeals  of  the  appellant's  family
    referred to at [1] above will proceed to a hearing on 27 May 2015.
