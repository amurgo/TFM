                                     and

Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr B Babatunde, Supreme Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the appellant, a citizen of Nigeria born  on  22nd
    November 1953, against the determination of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
    Judge Fox, in Richmond  on  25th  June  2014,  in  which  the  Tribunal
    dismissed the appellant's  application  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to cancel his leave to remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    refuse leave to enter.

2.   The respondent's  decision  bears  some  scrutiny.   It  is  dated  5th
    November 2013.  The respondent was, according to this,  satisfied  that
    false  representations  were  employed  or  material  facts  were   not
    disclosed for the purpose of obtaining the appellant's leave to  remain
    or that there had been such a change in circumstances since that  leave
    was granted that it should be cancelled.

3.   The decision records that the  application  which  the  appellant  made
    purported that he made profits of �33,032 for the  period  between  1st
    January 2011 and 31st December 2011.

         "The evidence you have provided were your accountant's  letter  and
         management accounts which enabled you to claim  35  points  towards
         the 75 you are required to have been issued with a Tier 1 (General)
         visa.  Whilst enquiries with HMRC  have  shown  that  you  declared
         �12,776 which would indicate you have been operating a  business  I
         am not satisfied that the records are accurate  for  the  following
         reasons."

    There then follow various criticisms of the business  records  kept  by
    the appellant.

4.   The following paragraph is I consider worthy of setting out in full.

         "When considering the evidence above I am not  satisfied  that  you
         have kept an adequate record of your business accountants (sic)  as
         you are unable to  provide  me  with  basic  financial  information
         relating to your business and you do not know if you would be  able
         to produce any financial records at a later date.  I  am  therefore
         satisfied that you have not provided your accountant with  accurate
         records that would have enabled him to produce a true reflection of
         your business in the documents he provided for you  to  produce  as
         evidence when making your application.  I am satisfied that this is
         a misrepresentation of relevant facts on  your  part.   I  am  also
         satisfied that your employment at the time  of  your  current  visa
         issue and to this date would not qualify as highly skilled  and  is
         not in keeping with the issue  of  Tier  4  (General)  Migrant.   I
         therefore cancel your visa under paragraph 321A(i) and (ii) of  the
         Immigration Rules."

5.   Paragraph 321A so far as material reads as follows:

         "The following grounds for the cancellation of a person's leave  to
         enter or remain which is in force on his arrival in, or  whilst  he
         is outside, the United Kingdom apply;


         (1)  there has been such a change  in  the  circumstances  of  that
             person's case since the leave was  given  that  it  should  be
             cancelled; or


         (2)  false  representations  were  made  or  false  documents  were
             submitted (whether or not material  to  the  application,  and
             whether or not to the holder's knowledge), or  material  facts
             were not disclosed, in relation to the application  for  leave
             or in order to obtain documents from the Secretary of State or
             a third party required in support of the application."

6.   The judge in the present case heard oral evidence from  the  applicant.
    He was asked about the asserted discrepancy in the figures provided  by
    his accountants.  In the  bundle  we  see  the  letters  to  which  the
    respondent referred in her notice  of  decision.   The  letter  of  5th
    January 2012 written by Fanla  &  Co  Accountants  and  Consultants  of
    London SW9 and produced in connection with the  application  for  leave
    states that the appellant had the following  "income  and  tax  details
    from 01 January to 31 December 2011".  The net  profit  in  respect  of
    that period was said to be �33,032.  However, a letter  from  the  same
    firm of accountants dated 13th March 2014 addressed  "to  whom  it  may
    concern" (and intended for HMRC) stated that in respect of  the  period
    from 1st January to 5th April 2012 the net profit was for the tax  year
    5th April 2012 �12,776.

7.   The judge heard evidence from the appellant in this regard and  I  have
    been provided with a typed transcript of what the judge heard for which
    I am grateful to Mr Babatunde.  The Home Office representative said:

         "Look at the second page of the document by HMRC.   The  money  you
         claimed to have earned is different from the one  you  declared  to
         HMRC on enquiry."

    The appellant:


         "I declared  �33,000  to  the  Home  Office  when  bringing  in  my
         application.  The net profit  of  �12,000  was  declared  later  to
         HMRC."

8.   What the judge made of this is to  be  seen  at  paragraph  31  of  his
    determination, where he said:

         "I do not accept that the appellant's evidence relates to different
         accounting periods which are meant to account for  the  discrepancy
         in the evidence.  The appellant  provided  oral  evidence  that  he
         answered questions  in  the  expectation  that  his  answers  would
         satisfy the Immigration Rules."

9.   And then at paragraph 33 we find this:


         "It is reasonable to expect an individual to answer questions  with
         a view to providing an accurate account of his circumstances.  When
         the evidence is  considered  in  the  round  it  is  reasonable  to
         conclude that the appellant sought to mislead the respondent at the
         interview and took active steps to  withhold  material  information
         about his economic activities in the UK."

10.  Permission was granted on the basis that the judge may  have  erred  in
    relation to the findings that he made  concerning  the  nature  of  the
    Highly Skilled Migrant Programme.  I find that I do not  need  to  deal
    with those issues because the findings that the judge made  in  respect
    of the letters to which I have referred and the  evidence  relating  to
    them are, despite Mr Babatunde's assertion to the contrary,  unarguably
    sound.

11.  The attempt to explain the gross discrepancy in the letters  by  saying
    that  they  relate  to  different  periods  is,  with  respect,  wholly
    misconceived.  The period covered by both of  the  letters  covers  the
    calendar  year  2011.   Indeed,  the  letter  of  30th  March  2014  is
    remarkable in giving a far lower net profit for a period  which  is  in
    fact longer than that calendar year, since it extends to April 2012.

12.  On the basis of the record of what was said at the hearing, it  appears
    to me that the judge was  unarguably  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
    appellant in his oral evidence indicated that he answered the questions
    regarding his application  for  leave,  in  the  expectation  that  his
    answers would satisfy the Immigration Rules.  Mr  Babatunde  reinforces
    that impression when he says that the earlier  letter  was  written  in
    order to obtain leave to remain and the later letter was written for  a
    different purpose.

13.  With respect, that is entirely unsatisfactory.  It  is  entirely  plain
    that the judge was entitled to find for the reasons that he  gave  that
    there had indeed been a misrepresentation and to find as  he  did  that
    the respondent, who bore the burden of showing that, had discharged  it
    to the requisite standard.

14.   The  documentation  complained  of  was  the  letter  written  to  the
    Secretary of State  by  the  accountants  giving  a  wholly  inaccurate
    description of the profits of the business, as evidenced by  the  later
    letter.

15.  For those reasons I find that the judge committed no error  of  law  in
    finding that  the  relevant  requirements  of  paragraph  321A  of  the
    Immigration Rules had been met on  the  part  of  the  respondent  and,
    accordingly, in dismissing the appellant's appeal.  This appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal is accordingly dismissed.
