For the Appellants:    Ms. B. Hashmi of Mamoon Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. I. Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. These are linked appeals against the decisions of First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge N M K Lawrence promulgated on  7  October  2014  dismissing  the
      Appellants' appeals against  decisions  of  the  Respondent  dated  11
      February 2014 to refuse to vary leave to remain and to remove each  of
      them from the UK pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and
      Nationality Act 2006.


Background

   2. The Appellants are nationals of Pakistan born on 25 December 1981,  17
      May 1986, and 2 July 1977 respectively. The  First  Appellant  is  the
      wife of the Third Appellant. The  Appellants'  respective  immigration
      histories are a matter of record on file and are known to the parties:
      accordingly I do not reproduce them here. On 10 July  2013  the  First
      and  Second  Appellants  applied  for  leave  to  remain  as  Tier   1
      (Entrepreneur) migrants; the Third  Appellant  applied  for  leave  to
      remain as the partner of his wife. Their applications were refused for
      reasons set out in respective combined 'reasons for  refusal'  letters
      and Notices of Immigration Decision dated 11 February 2014.


   3. The Appellants appealed to the IAC.


   4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appeals  of  each  of  the
      Appellants for reasons set out in his decision.


   5. The Appellants applied for permission to appeal which was  granted  by
      First-tier Tribunal Judge Simpson on 24 October 2014.


   6. The Respondent has filed a Rule 24 response  dated  12  November  2014
      resisting the challenge to the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal.


Consideration

   7. The Respondent refused the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) applications  of  the
      First and Second Appellant after consideration of supporting documents
      and interviews with  the  First  and  Second  Appellants,  essentially
      because  she  was  not  satisfied  that  they  genuinely  intended  to
      establish themselves in business, or genuinely intended to invest  the
      funds claimed  to  be  available,  or  that  the  claimed  funds  were
      genuinely available. It may readily be appreciated that these  matters
      are interrelated.


   8. The decision letters in this regard, in my  judgement,  are  on  their
      face cogent and well-reasoned. Issues were raised in particular about:
      reconciling the source of ï¿½50,000  joint  funds  with  the  respective
      narrative accounts given by each of the entrepreneurial applicants  at
      interview and the tracing of the sources of such funds;  the  personal
      and business relationship between  the  First  and  Second  Appellant,
      including their geographical separation both in Pakistan  and  in  the
      UK; the absence of any apparent evidence of  market  research  coupled
      with inconsistencies in  their  respective  accounts  as  to  who  was
      responsible for conducting market research; the logistics of operating
      the business, including the apparent search for premises in Stoke when
      most of the potential clients were said to be based in the Luton area;
      the contractual agreement to provide business  services  to  a  client
      based in Manchester; a similar earlier application had been refused in
      respect of the availability of funds on the basis that the  supporting
      documents did not  meet  the  evidential  criteria,  yet  the  current
      application did not seek to rely on the same funds but  on  apparently
      different sources of funding - the  Respondent  considered  that  this
      demonstrated that the previous funds had not been genuinely  available
      which in turn cast doubt on the claimed current availability of funds.
      Overall the Respondent formed the view that the  evidential  materials
      provided by the Appellants  had  been  'put  together'  simply  in  an
      attempt to meet the requirements of the Rules but  did  not  represent
      any genuine business intentions.


   9. The Third Appellant was refused 'in line'  with  the  refusal  of  his
      wife.


  10. On appeal the First-tier Tribunal Judge upheld the  decisions  of  the
      Respondent. In some respects I acknowledge that it might be said  that
      the  decision  of  the  Judge  is  less  thorough  than  that  of  the
      Respondent's decision-maker: the focus  in  the  Judge's  decision  is
      primarily on the availability of funds and there is far less by way of
      consideration of the overall viability of the business and the genuine
      intentions of the Appellants. Be that as  it  may,  the  Judge  having
      reviewed the evidence and set out his findings stated  his  conclusion
      in the following terms at paragraph 20, which in my judgement  fairly,
      adequately, and sustainably reflect both his  previous  reasoning  and
      the bases of the Respondent's decisions:

"On the evidence before me I find the first and second  appellants  are  not
      genuine business persons. Their claim that  they  wish  to  operate  a
      business in the UK is not genuine. They are not able to say where  the
      funds for their joint venture is said  to  come  from.  Their  account
      given in the interview is not supported by the history of the deposits
      made into their investment funds. In my view, the  funds  have  [been]
      put together but not for the purposes of a genuine  business  venture.
      They live in two different cities but have not provided  any  evidence
      at all as to how they intend to run their  business.  Meeting  once  a
      month does not demonstrate that this is a  genuine  business  venture.
      The provision of invoices is insufficient evidence  of  any  business.
      There must be paper trail from service provided to customer."



  11. The Appellants' challenge to the decisions of the First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge as set out in the Grounds in  support  of  the  application  for
      permission to appeal are in part essentially a disagreement  with  the
      findings of the Judge and the outcome in the  appeal  (eg  Grounds  at
      paragraphs 1-3, 6-7, 10), in part allege unfairness by the  Judge  for
      not putting matters of  dispute  to  the  Appellants  (eg  Grounds  at
      paragraphs 3, 4-5, 8, 10, 11), and in part claim that the Judge  erred
      in not being satisfied that invoices  provided  adequate  evidence  of
      trade (Grounds at paragraphs 9-10).


  12. It appears that it was this latter basis of challenge that  influenced
      the decision to grant permission to  appeal.  Judge  Simpson  observed
      that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  "failed  to  consider  the  recent
      decisions in Shebl (Entrepreneur:  proof  of  contracts)  [2014]  UKUT
      00216 (IAC) and Ahmed & Anor (PBS: admissible  evidence)  [2014]  UKUT
      00365 (IAC) when considering the evidential value of the [invoices]".


  13. I do not find a consideration of either case assists the Appellants in
      demonstrating an error of law  in  the  context  of  their  particular
      appeals. The case of Ahmed is about the exclusion of new evidence  and
      therefore is not directly 'on point'. The case of Shebl  is  concerned
      with the evidential requirements of paragraph 41-SD of Appendix  A  of
      the Rules and is therefore not concerned with the overall viability of
      a business, which is the essential  basis  of  the  adverse  decisions
      herein.


  14. Moreover I  find  that  there  is  no  substance  in  the  Appellants'
      complaints to the effect that the Judge failed to put matters to  them
      that were ultimately adversely determinative  in  their  appeals.  The
      Judge has not  relied  on  any  matters  that  were  not  clearly  and
      adequately raised in the Respondent's decisions. In this context it is
      to be  recalled  that  the  decisions  rejected  the  applications  in
      fundamental terms: nothing in relation to either the  funding  or  the
      genuine intentions and viability of the proposed business was accepted
      by the Respondent. It was, therefore, made  clear  to  the  Appellants
      that all issues were at large in the  appeal.  It  was  not,  in  such
      circumstances, for the Judge to seek to engage the Appellants  by  way
      of some interrogatory process, but for the  Appellants  to  make  good
      their case under the Rules in all respects.


  15. For the avoidance of any doubt I make it clear that  I  consider  that
      the Appellants at paragraph 11  of  the  grounds  in  support  of  the
      application for permission to appeal misunderstood the  basis  of  the
      Respondent's reliance upon the refusal of their  earlier  application.
      It is clear from the decision letter that  the  Respondent  considered
      that the apparent failure in the current application to  make  use  of
      the  funds  said  to  have  been  available  to  support  the  earlier
      application cast doubt on the genuine availability of those  funds  in
      the  earlier  application,  and  thereby  cast  doubt  both   of   the
      genuineness of the First and Second Appellant  as  entrepreneurs,  and
      the veracity of their current claims in respect of funding. That was a
      matter to which the Respondent was entitled to have  regard.  Further,
      it was a matter clearly raised in the refusals, and  was  therefore  a
      matter which the  Appellants  had  every  opportunity  to  address  on
      appeal.


  16. I detect no procedural unfairness in the approach taken by the  First-
      tier Tribunal. In my judgement the evaluation of the evidence was open
      to the Judge, and he reached sustainable conclusions  in  the  appeals
      which are adequately reasoned.


  17. The Appellants' Grounds include  a  single  paragraph  in  respect  of
      Article 8. The paragraph is premised on the Appellants "running a well-
      established business in the United  Kingdom"  into  which  "they  have
      already investment major chunk of the investment funds".  This  ground
      does not actually allege any error  of  law,  and  in  any  event  its
      premises fail on the findings of the Judge.


  18. Accordingly,  in  all  the  circumstances  I  reject  the  Appellants'
      challenge to the decisions of the First-tier Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

  19. The decisions of the First-tier Tribunal contained no  errors  of  law
      and stand.


  20. Appeal IA/10731/2014 is dismissed.


  21. Appeal IA/12479/2014 is dismissed.


  22. Appeal IA/14887/2014 is dismissed.
