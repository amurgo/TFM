                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State has been granted permission  to  appeal  to  the
    Upper Tribunal against a decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal A
    A Wilson who, following a hearing  on  21  January  2015,  allowed  the
    appeal of Mr. Ogunfolabi (hereafter the "claimant") against a  decision
    of the Secretary of State of 1 May 2014 refusing his request for an EEA
    residence card as confirmation of his right to  reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom as an extended  family  member  of  his  brother,  a  Mr  Gbemi
    Ogunfolabi (hereafter the  "sponsor"),  who  was  said  to  be  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty rights.

 2. The grounds contend (in summary) that Judge Wilson materially erred  in
    law in finding that the claimant was dependent on the sponsor and lived
    as a member of his household, whilst in Belgium and in the UK.   It  is
    said that the judge did not refer to any evidence  at  [5]-[9]  of  the
    determination which pointed to dependency; that there was no  reference
    to any evidence which indicated that the sponsor was living in  Belgium
    with the claimant and supporting the claimant; and that  there  was  no
    reference  to  evidence  which  indicated  that  there  was  continuing
    dependency in the UK.

 3. Ms Holmes accepted that she could not argue that  the  judge  erred  in
    making a finding in the absence of  documentary  evidence.  She  relied
    upon the grounds.

 4. The judge summarised the oral evidence at [2].  He  made  his  positive
    findings at [5]-[8]. When the determination is read as a whole,  it  is
    plain that he relied upon the oral evidence that he heard in  order  to
    reach his findings. It is plain that he made his  findings  because  he
    accepted the oral evidence, although he did not say so.

 5. The grounds do not point to any internal inconsistencies or  any  other
    difficulties with the judge's determination. The only  point  taken  is
    that the judge had not  referred  to  the  evidence  of  dependency  in
    Belgium and the UK. However, this ignores the oral  evidence  that  the
    judge summarised at [2] and which it is  plain  (as  stated  above)  he
    accepted.

 6. Accordingly, we have concluded that the judge did not err in law.

    Decision

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.
