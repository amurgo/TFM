                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The Appellant, who is a citizen of India, had applied for  a  residence
    card under the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 as
    the spouse of a Romanian national who was said to be exercising  treaty
    rights.  The Secretary of State refused the application as she was  not
    satisfied on the basis of the information which was  put  forward  that
    the spouse was exercising treaty  rights  as  claimed.   The  Appellant
    appealed against that decision to the First-tier Tribunal  and  elected
    for his appeal to be determined on papers without a hearing.

 2. The appeal was considered by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Obhi  and  was
    dismissed in a decision promulgated on 26th March 2015.  The judge  was
    not satisfied on the information before her that the claimed employment
    was genuine.  The Appellant then sought permission to  appeal  to  this
    Tribunal. He claimed that there had been  sufficient  evidence  of  his
    wife's working, that the judge had  wrongly  referred  to  there  being
    financial dependence by the spouse upon  the  Appellant  and  that  the
    judge had said that the case presented a confused picture. If  she  was
    not clear about the evidence, the Appellant argued, then she was not in
    a position to decide the case.  Permission was  granted  on  15th  July
    2015.  In the grant it was  suggested  that  there  were  contradictory
    findings as the judge had said that  it  appeared  that  the  wife  was
    working but had ultimately said that she was  not  satisfied  that  the
    wife was working.

 3. The appeal was called on before me at 12.45pm.  There was no attendance
    by or  on  behalf  of  the  Appellant.   The  Appellant  did  not  have
    representatives but it appeared from the file that  notice  of  hearing
    had been sent to him on 2nd February 2016 at his  address  notified  to
    the Tribunal in the Notice of Appeal  and  other  documents,  namely  [
                                                             ].   Mr  Mills
    was not  aware  of  any  other  address  for  the  Appellant.   In  the
    circumstances I was satisfied that the Appellant had been  notified  of
    the date, time and place of the hearing.  I considered it  was  in  the
    interests of justice to proceed and exercised  my  discretion  to  that
    effect under Upper Tribunal Procedure Rule 38.

 4. Mr Mills in addressing me said that there were in fact no contradictory
    findings in the decision of Judge Obhi.  Paragraph 15 of  the  decision
    had  to  be  read  in  context  and  overall  there  was  very  limited
    documentation.  The judge found the evidence provided to be  disjointed
    and confusing.  A position with one employer was evidenced by a  letter
    but referred to the spouse being paid by cash-in-hand and no pay  slips
    were produced.  A letter from a pizza company was  dated  very  shortly
    before the appeal  was  decided  and  again  no  pay  slips  have  been
    provided.  The Appellant had elected for a paper hearing and  thus  had
    not given any  oral  evidence  in  support  of  his  contentions.   The
    transfer of �600 by the Appellant to the wife had to  be  read  in  the
    context of the credibility findings and were  to  the  effect  that  it
    would be surprising if the Appellant were  transferring  money  to  the
    wife if she were the party working.  He submitted that  the  judge  was
    entitled to take issue with the evidence.   The  burden  was  upon  the
    Appellant and had not been discharged.  There had not been  a  positive
    finding that the wife was working but it appeared the judge's intention
    was simply to state that the claim was that she was working.

 5. In considering the merits of this appeal I bear in mind that the burden
    of proof was upon the Appellant and all the judge had before  her  upon
    which to decide the case was the documentation submitted.  There is  no
    merit in the claim that if the evidence was confusing the judge  should
    not have decided against the Appellant; this is self-evident  from  the
    fact that the burden was upon the Appellant to put forward a case which
    was persuasive on the balance of probabilities.  It is correct that  at
    paragraph 15 of the decision the judge mentioned that the Appellant had
    transferred the sum of �600 to the EEA national and stated:

         "There is no explanation for this,  particularly  considering  that
         the Appellant is not entitled to work and it appears that the  wife
         is working.  Under those circumstances I would expect to have  seen
         some level of financial dependency by the Appellant on his wife."

    In the context of that paragraph the thrust of what  the  judge  stated
    was that in the light of  the  Appellant's  claim  that  the  wife  was
    working, she would have expected financial transfers to have been  made
    by the wife to the Appellant and not vice versa.  That was a legitimate
    comment and read in context does not amount to a contradictory finding.



 6. The judge went on, at paragraph 15, to state that  a  confused  picture
    was presented of the employment of the EEA national and  it  seemed  to
    her that the documents provided by the Appellant were insufficient  for
    her to determine that the employment of the EEA national  was  genuine.
    The judge also noted there was an absence of statements from either the
    Appellant or his wife, which might have assisted.  She clearly  applied
    the correct burden and standard of proof.  Read as a whole the decision
    does not reveal a potentially material error on a point of law and  the
    judge's decision therefore stands.

Notice of Decision

There was no material error of law in the making  of  the  decision  by  the
First-tier Tribunal Judge and that decision therefore stands.

There was no application for an anonymity order.  I saw  no  cause  for  any
such order to be made and none is made.
