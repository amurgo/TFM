For the Appellant:     Ms G Fama of Counsel, instructed via Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This appeal comes  back  before  me  further  to  the  'error  of  law'
    decision made at the hearing on 10 October 2017,  and  further  to  the
    adjourned hearing on 15 November 2017.  'Decisions  and  Reasons'  were
    prepared both in respect of the 'error of law' decision and in  respect
    of the adjournment.  Those Decisions are a matter of record on file and
    should be considered as if incorporated into the decision I give now.


2.   [MO] is a citizen of Nigeria born on [ ] 2003.  She appeals  against  a
    decision to refuse her entry clearance to join her  parents,  [LO]  and
    [FO], in the UK.


3.   Mr and Mrs [O] have had three further children in the  United  Kingdom,
    born respectively on [ ] 2006, [ ] 2009 and  [  ]  2015.   Those  three
    children are British citizens.  [FO] is settled in the United  Kingdom.
    [LO], at the date of the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal, was  a
    person with limited leave to remain.  He has embarked on the  so-called
    '10 year route' to settlement, having been granted leave to  remain  on
    the basis of his relationship with his British citizen children.  I was
    told today that pursuant to the '10 year route' he is expected to renew
    his leave every 30 months, and that it would not be until 2025 that  he
    might expect to acquire settlement.  I was also told today that  he  is
    presently awaiting a decision on one such application for further leave
    to remain.  I return to this circumstance in due course.


4.   [LO] first came to the United  Kingdom  in  2004,  when  the  Appellant
    would have been little more than a  baby.   [FO]  came  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2005.  The Appellant was left, it is  said,  with  a  family
    friend: indeed one of the matters highlighted in this case  in  support
    of the need to be reunited with her parents is that the  Appellant  has
    since that time for the main part  lived  with  one  family  friend  or
    another until such time as she went to boarding school - and even then,
    during the vacation  periods,  she  would  stay  with  family  friends.
    However, there was a period from 2006 when the Appellant's father lived
    with her in Nigeria.  [LO] was removed from the United Kingdom in  2006
    and spent two years in Nigeria being responsible  for  the  Appellant's
    education and welfare:  notwithstanding,  he  returned  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2008 to resume life with his wife  and  at  that  time,  one
    young child.  However, it was not until 2015 that he secured  leave  to
    remain in his own right.


5.   The Appellant herself has  commented  upon  this  background  and  life
    experience in her witness statement before the First-tier  Tribunal  in
    the following way:


          "As far as I could remember, I have never  really  lived  with  my
         biological parents for that long.  I know my father very well but I
         do not really know my mother in person because I was too young when
         she left for the UK.   All  my  life,  I  have  been  staying  with
         different set of people until my father had  to  make  arrangements
         for me to be a  boarding  student.   Although  I  do  not  want  to
         complain, I desire to be like any child that lives with their loved
         ones.  My case is not the case.  I moved from  one  family  to  the
         other and when it appears I am settled in that house  with  such  a
         family, I would be forced to leave there.  Being a boarding student
         has its own draw back as all I want is to live with my parents  and
         get to know my siblings."




6.   The difficult nature of this family history  is  brought  into  further
    relief through the witness statement filed by  the  Appellant's  father
    dated 25 January 2018.  [LO] says this:

         "Although I have taken time out to visit her  regularly  to  ensure
         she is ok and she is well catered for, since my wife left her  when
         she was 2 years old she has never set her  eye  on  my  wife.   The
         Appellant does not even know her brother and her sisters  who  were
         all born in the UK and  achieved  settled  status.   The  Appellant
         cries every day because she wants to re-establish contact with  her
         mother and her siblings.  I feel pain in my heart  any  time  I  am
         leaving her after  visiting  her.   She  cries  a  lot  and  it  is
         difficult for her when the parents of her peers come to  pick  them
         during holiday and none of us is around.  This has become the  norm
         for several years and it has affected her in many ways as she keeps
         staying with one family and other every time she is on holiday from
         her studies when they have to vacate the school's dormitory."

     Later in the statement the following appears:

         "For twelve years she has not seen her  mother.   ...She  does  not
         know how her mother looks aside the pictures she has seen.  She has
         siblings, yet she has also not seen them except what they look like
         in pictures.  This is complete torture  for  her.   Her  peers  and
         friends talk about their parents and siblings and when such  topics
         are discussed she informed me that she is always ever downcast  and
         teary because she does not have the same relationship  others  have
         with their parents and siblings."

     Yet further the following is stated:

         "My wife regrets to date why she left our daughter behind when  she
         arrived in the United Kingdom in 2005.  Although she tried as  much
         as possible to keep in touch with our daughter,  my  wife  is  very
         much disturbed because it appears anytime she  has  a  conversation
         with our daughter on the telephone it feels as if she  is  speaking
         with a stranger.  She could sense a resentment from  the  Appellant
         as a result of which she cries every time.  She wants our  daughter
         to join us in the UK so that we can live as a  family.   She  wants
         her to get to know the rest of the family.  She is really desperate
         that the Appellant can come to the UK."


7.   The Appellant made an application  for  entry  clearance  to  join  her
    parents shortly after both parents had acquired regularised immigration
    status in the United Kingdom.  The application was refused for  reasons
    set out in a Notice of Immigration Decision dated 2 November 2015, with
    reference to paragraphs 297(i),(iv) and (v) of  the  Immigration  Rules
    and also after consideration of Article 8.


8.   The appeal before the Tribunal is restricted to  human  rights  grounds
    in accordance with the provisions of the Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002.  Nonetheless, it is appropriate to have regard to  the
    Immigration Rules as offering something by way of an  indicator  as  to
    where proportionality ordinarily is considered to lie in cases such  as
    this.  To that end, and further to the earlier  proceedings  herein,  I
    have been able to have a helpful discussion with  both  representatives
    at the commencement of the hearing as to the framework under which this
    appeal is to be considered.


9.   In the first instance I should make it clear that even though  this  is
    an entry clearance case and prior to the recent amendments to the  2002
    Act the Tribunal would ordinarily have evaluated matters as of the date
    of the Respondent's decision, given the amendments to the 2002  Act  by
    virtue of the Immigration Act 2014 - and in particular  the  repeal  of
    the old section 85(4) - it is common ground that  the  Tribunal  should
    evaluate matters as of the date of the hearing.


10.  It is also now common ground - essentially for the reasons explored  in
    my earlier Decisions - that paragraph 297 of the Immigration Rules  was
    of no application to the Appellant's case.


11.  Ms Fama had raised the possible applicability of paragraph 301  of  the
    Immigration Rules during the previous  hearing.   However,  it  is  now
    acknowledged that that Rule is  of  no  application  in  light  of  the
    transitional provisions under Part  8  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  in
    particular paragraphs A277 and A280, which make it clear that paragraph
    301 no longer applies in a case such as the  Appellant's.   Accordingly
    it is now common ground that the only applicable provision by which the
    Appellant could succeed under the Immigration Rules is that set out  in
    Appendix FM at Section EC-C - 'Entry clearance as a child'.


12.   In  this  regard  Mr  Tufan  raised  an  issue  in  respect   of   the
    'relationship requirement' under E-ECC.1.6, pursuant to  which  one  of
    the Appellant's parents would be required to be present in the UK  with
    limited leave to enter.  Up until very recently it was clearly the case
    that the Appellant's father satisfied such a  condition.   However,  Mr
    Tufan highlighted that [LO] was presently enjoying  leave  pursuant  to
    section 3C of the Immigration Rules 1971,  because  he  had  a  pending
    application for variation of leave  to  remain.   Mr  Tufan  queried  -
    rather than argued forcibly - that that might mean  that  paragraph  E-
    ECC.1.6 was not presently satisfied.


13.  In my judgment the Appellant's father's  current  leave  -  statutorily
    extended leave by virtue of section 3C  -  must  be  considered  to  be
    limited leave within the  contemplation  of  E-ECC.1.6  because  it  is
    essentially a statutory variation of an extant limited leave  which  in
    itself, although not limited by  reference  to  a  specified  date,  is
    nonetheless inevitably limited given that it only pertains for so  long
    as any of the circumstances identified in section 3C(2) might apply.


14.  Even if it were otherwise, I would not be prepared to take the view  on
    all of the facts of this particular case that the interim status of the
    Appellant's father should in itself frustrate the Appellant's appeal  -
    which is brought on Article 8 grounds  rather  than  Immigration  Rules
    grounds.  [LO] was previously granted permission to remain on the basis
    of his relationship with his British citizen children,  notwithstanding
    adverse aspects  of  his  immigration  history  (including  a  previous
    removal). The relationship with his British citizen children continues,
    and there is little to suggest that there is anything  further  adverse
    that might be said against him.  I say 'little to suggest' rather  than
    'nothing to suggest' because Ms Fama brought to my attention  a  letter
    confirming that [LO] had an outstanding  application  lodged  with  the
    Home  Office,  but  which  stated  that  the  application  was  pending
    consideration given that there  was  an  impending  prosecution.   [LO]
    denied  any  knowledge  of  such  a  prosecution;   indeed   Mr   Tufan
    acknowledged that it might be no more than a mistaken reference to  the
    matters that had previously resulted in  [LO]'s  removal  in  2006.   I
    return briefly to this factor at the end of this Decision.  Suffice  to
    say for the moment: I am  not  persuaded  that  [LO]'s  status  pending
    consideration of an application for variation of  leave  to  remain  is
    such as to take the Appellant outside the requirements of the Rules; in
    any event, even if it were, it is not such  as  to  defeat  her  appeal
    without more.


15.  So far as the financial requirements  of  Appendix  FM  are  concerned,
    because the Appellant's  siblings  are  British  citizens  it  is  only
    necessary to add to the �18,600 specified at E-ECC.2.1(a)(i) the sum of
    �3,800 "for the first child" specified at E-ECC.2.1(a)(ii).  That makes
    a target income of �22,400. The Appellant's  father  produced  evidence
    before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  he  had   recently   commenced
    employment - see  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Wright  at
    paragraph 18.  This is not to suggest that the Appellant's  father  had
    not previously been in employment, but rather that he had started a new
    job.  He produced a job offer letter dated 2 February 2017 offering him
    a role at  an  income  of  �21,247  and  a  number  of  payslips  which
    demonstrated that he had accepted that role.  The  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge accepted that evidence.


16.  [LO] has filed further up-to-date payslips in this  regard  which  show
    him in receipt of a gross monthly income of �1,814.13 - which  adds  up
    to an annual income of �22,000.92.   He  confirmed  that  this  was  in
    respect of the same job that he had recently undertaken at the time  of
    the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal.


17.  It may be seen that that income is  very  slightly  under  the  �22,400
    target under the Rules.  However, in this regard the Appellant's father
    indicated that in addition to his main employment  he  also  works  two
    days a week at the weekends as a cleaner.  He has  previously  provided
    evidence of such employment with Turquoise Cleaning, and today provided
    confirmation by way of a bank statement, albeit produced electronically
    before the court, of receipt of �203 into his account yesterday.  This,
    he said, was  pay  for  the  previous  weekend's  work  with  Turquoise
    Cleaning - work that he completed, as  indicated  above,  on  a  weekly
    basis.  This modest additional income would take his earning level over
    that specified in the Immigration Rules.


18.  I am satisfied on a  balance  of  probabilities  that  the  Appellant's
    father does indeed earn presently beyond the  limited  specified  under
    the Rules.


19.  I am also satisfied that adequate accommodation would be available  for
    the Appellant.  A tenancy agreement has been produced  in  this  regard
    and I can identify nothing in that tenancy agreement that would suggest
    that the Appellant's parents require any further  permission  from  the
    landlord  for  their  daughter  to  join  them.    Moreover,   as   the
    accommodation is 3-bedroom accommodation, it is accepted  by  Mr  Tufan
    that there would be no statutory overcrowding in  the  event  that  the
    Appellant were to live there with her parents and siblings.


20.  Again, on a balance of probabilities, I  accept  that  the  Appellant's
    parents are in a position to provide her  with  adequate  accommodation
    within the family home.


21.  In those circumstances, in substance, I can identify nothing under  the
    Immigration Rules that would prevent an application for entry clearance
    succeeding at the current time. This conclusion forms a foundation  for
    considering  Article  8,  and  in  particular  informs  evaluation   of
    proportionality.


22.  I have given some consideration to whether the answer in this  case  is
    not simply to suggest that it is proportionate to expect the  Appellant
    to re-apply for entry clearance.  That would necessarily mean that  any
    issues  that  might  arise  in  respect  of  the  Appellant's  father's
    immigration status could be considered and/or resolved,  and  it  would
    also mean that the appropriate 'specified evidence' in accordance  with
    Appendix FM-SE might be produced.  However, it has been urged  upon  me
    by Ms Fama that the expediency of the case would favour  the  Appellant
    being granted entry clearance as soon as possible, rather than there be
    yet further delay in a case that has already gone on for some time  and
    in  circumstances  where  the  Appellant  is   plausibly   experiencing
    increasing upset and anxiety over her predicament.  I am persuaded that
    that is indeed the appropriate approach.


23.  In all of the circumstances, I  find  that  the  Appellant's  exclusion
    from the United Kingdom by reason of the Respondent's  decision  -  and
    the concomitant inhibition of her ability to strengthen  the  bonds  of
    family life with her father, to rediscover family life with her mother,
    and to discover for the first time family  life  with  her  siblings  -
    constitutes  a  disproportionate  interference  with  the   Appellant's
    Article 8 rights, and the mutual rights of her family members.


24.  Of course it may well be that circumstances change between now and  the
    granting of entry clearance - in particular if it turns out that  there
    is indeed something against the Appellant's father  with  regard  to  a
    prosecution  that  might  impact  upon  his  immigration  status.   The
    Appellant and her family  should  be  aware  that  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer may lawfully have regard to any changes of  circumstance  which
    may result in further consideration of whether entry  clearance  should
    indeed be granted,  irrespective  of  the  favourable  outcome  in  the
    appeal,.  However, absent any such changes,  I  am  entirely  satisfied
    that the proportionate outcome is that  the  Appellant  should  now  be
    granted entry clearance to join her family in the United Kingdom.


25.  I observed during the course of the hearing that this case brings  into
    stark relief the sometimes very unfortunate  circumstances  surrounding
    'left behind' children.  In my  judgment  the  best  interests  of  the
    Appellant presently are served by being reunited with her parents - but
    it may not be the case that it could be said that the Appellant's  best
    interests have always been served hitherto.  In this regard,  whilst  I
    have no doubt that the Appellant's parents have thought that they  were
    acting in the long-term best interests of their daughter in  trying  to
    make something of a life in the United Kingdom  for  her  to  come  and
    join,  the  long  and  difficult  pursuit  has  resulted  in   a   very
    considerable disruption to the relationship between the  Appellant  and
    her parents.  The witness statements talk in  terms  of  the  extremely
    difficult relationship between the  Appellant  and  her  mother  to  an
    extent that they are now largely strangers to each other.  Moreover, it
    seems to me likely that the Appellant may feel some considerable  sense
    of exclusion from the lives of her siblings and from  the  family  unit
    established in the UK.  It may be that the family  will  have  to  work
    hard to get over some of the emotional consequences of  the  manner  in
    which they have made their domestic  arrangements  over  the  past  few
    years.  I bear in mind that the Appellant as a  minor  is  not  herself
    directly responsible for any of  these  matters,  and  in  all  of  the
    circumstances I am not prepared to take the view that the  arrangements
    made and acquiesced in by the parents should essentially  now  be  held
    against the Appellant in circumstances where in substance she satisfies
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.


26.  For the avoidance of any doubt, I have had regard to section  117B  and
    the considerations thereunder in reaching my decision.  Certain aspects
    of section 117B do not really fall for consideration in the context  of
    an entry clearance application. Be that as it may, ultimately it  seems
    to me that in terms where the Rules are in substance met,  the  outcome
    that I have reached is not in any way contrary to the  public  interest
    requirements.
