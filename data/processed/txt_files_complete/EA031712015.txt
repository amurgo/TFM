Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr A Briddock, counsel, instructed by Visa Legal
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Algeria, born on 9 May 1979. He appeals
      with permission against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      who, in a decision promulgated  on  16  January  2017,  dismissed  his
      appeal against the decision of the respondent refusing his application
      made on 24  June  2015  for  a  permanent  residence  card  under  the
      Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2006.

   2. The Judge found that the EEA  national  had  established  five  years'
      residence by the time she stopped working and still has  "a  right  of
      permanent residence [16]". At paragraph [20]  the  Judge  stated  that
      although she was satisfied that the EEA national  herself  would  have
      been entitled to permanent residence by the end of 2012, she  had  not
      been exercising Treaty rights since February 2013 until very recently.
      The appellant had therefore not been living with her as her spouse for
      a period of five years during which she was exercising Treaty rights.

   3. On  27  July  2017,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Pickup  granted  the
      appellant permission to appeal on the basis that it was arguable  that
      the Judge erred in law in misconstruing the meaning  of  "residing  in
      accordance with the Regulations" under  Regulation  15(1)(b).  It  was
      arguable that  for  a  continuous  period  exceeding  five  years  the
      appellant had been a family member of an EEA national who has a  right
      of permanent residence.

   4. The appellant had  not  been  represented  at  the  First-tier  appeal
      hearing. The Judge noted that it was  accepted  that  the  only  issue
      before her was to determine whether the sponsor  had  been  exercising
      Treaty rights for a continuous period of five years [7].

   5.  Mr  Briddock  submitted  that  the  Judge  found  at  [16]  that  the
      appellant's wife  had  and  still  does  have  a  right  of  permanent
      residence. Moreover, she found that she acquired  permanent  residence
      some time in 2012 as she had been a "worker" from some time in 2007.

   6. The couple were married on 28 January 2010. Accordingly by the Judge's
      own findings the appellant's  wife  had  been  living  in  the  UK  in
      accordance with the Regulations since 2007  to  date,  as  she  was  a
      worker from some time in  2007  until  some  time  in  2012  and  then
      acquired permanent residence which she retains.

   7. The couple had been married for a period of at least five years whilst
      the appellant's wife was living in  the  UK  in  accordance  with  the
      regulations. Accordingly, he too acquired permanent  residence  on  28
      January 2015, which was five years from the date of their marriage.

   8. He submitted that the Judge misdirected herself by  finding  that  the
      appellant's wife needed to be a "qualified person" during all the five
      years after marriage. In fact, she needed to be "living in the  UK  in
      accordance with the Regulations" which she was.

   9. On behalf of the respondent,  Ms  Isherwood  relied  on  the  Rule  24
      response. She also sought to contend that  the  Judge  made  a  "legal
      error" with regard  to  her  finding  that  the  Polish  national  had
      acquired permanent residence. She referred to s.5(2) of the  Accession
      (Immigration and Worker Registration) Regulations 2004  that  provides
      that an accession state worker requiring registration shall be treated
      as a worker for the purpose of the definition of 'qualified person' in
      Regulation 5(1) of the  2000 Regulations only during a period in which
      he is working in the UK for an authorised employer.

  10. The national in this case was only registered in 2008.  That  is  when
      the period begins for calculating whether or not she  is  entitled  to
      permanent residence. It did not begin in 2007.

  11. In reply, Mr Briddock objected to this point which was only raised  at
      the hearing. This 'alleged legal point' had never been raised  before.
      The appellant and his wife require certainty. The application was made
      in 2015. The decision is now almost two years old having been  decided
      on 19 November 2015.

  12. The respondent has been on notice throughout. The respondent has never
      sought to challenge the findings of the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  as
      to his wife acquiring  permanent residence.

  13. There has never been any cross-appeal. Nor was the issue  ever  raised
      in the reasons for refusal. The only matter  contended  was  that  the
      appellant had provided insufficient evidence of how  his  sponsor  was
      exercising Treaty rights in the UK from 2010 until 2015. They had only
      married on 28 January 2010 and had not produced any evidence of  being
      in a relationship before that time.

  14. Nor was this matter ever raised before the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
      respondent was represented at the time.   The  point  now  raised  was
      never reduced to writing. The appellant had never been put  on  notice
      that such a point would be raised. There has been  no  opportunity  to
      address or put forward any legal arguments.

  15. The issue was never raised in the Rule 24 letter.

  16. The finding of the Judge is clear, namely,  that  the  sponsor  was  a
      worker from some time in 2007 until the end of  2012  and  would  have
      been entitled to permanent residence by the end  of  2012.  She  found
      that she had and still has a right of permanent residence [16-20].

  17. He submitted that the Judge was in  error  in  finding  that  the  EEA
      national was not exercising Treaty rights since February 2013. At  the
      time of the application on 24 June 2015 she stated  that  the  sponsor
      had not been exercising Treaty rights and had ceased to exercise  them
      in February 2013 at the latest.

  18. The Judge noted that she had stated that she was registered  with  the
      JobCentre during some of the period when she  was  off  work  but  was
      clearly not actively looking for work. It is understandable  that  she
      wished to remain at home with her children and not go to work but that
      meant that she ceased to be a worker for  the  purposes  of  the  2006
      Regulations [17].  Those are the issues which have been raised.

  19. In any event, Mr Briddock did not accept that the point raised  is  "a
      good point." He submitted  that  in  the  circumstances  it  would  be
      "wholly inappropriate to entertain the new argument".

Assessment

  20. The appellant made an application pursuant to  the  2006  Regulations,
      s.15(1)(b) of which  provides that the following persons shall acquire
      the right to reside in the UK permanently, namely a family  member  of
      an EEA national who is not himself an EEA national but who has resided
      in the UK with the EEA national in accordance with  these  regulations
      for a continuous period of five years.

  21. The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal was that his sponsor began
      employment in the UK on 8 November 2007 and was  working  continuously
      until 23 May 2013 at the end of her  maternity  leave.  The  appellant
      married his sponsor on 28 January 2010 and was issued an EEA residence
      card in September that year.

  22. His wife was on maternity leave from 20 February 2012. Their child was
      born on 5 May 2012. Her final date of employment was on 31 May 2013.

  23. The appellant applied for permanent residence in June 2015.

  24. The First-tier Judge found at  [16]  that  the  sponsor  had  acquired
      permanent residence in 2012 after exercising Treaty rights as a worker
      since 2007. She had established five years' residence by the time  she
      stopped working.

  25. She also found that the appellant has been cohabiting with the sponsor
      since May 2008 until the present.

  26. The Judge stated at [19] that the sponsor must be actively  exercising
      Treaty rights for five years during the period of  their  marriage  in
      order for the appellant to succeed. That  Mr  Briddock  contended,  is
      incorrect.

  27. Regulation 15(1)(2) provides that the  right  of  permanent  residence
      under the Regulations shall only be lost through absence from  the  UK
      for a period exceeding two consecutive  years.  There  is  however  no
      finding or indeed any contention that the sponsor left the UK for such
      a period after acquiring a right of permanent residence. As noted, the
      evidence is to the contrary: she has been resident here since 2007  on
      a continuous basis.

  28. I accept the submission that at the date of  the  appeal  hearing  the
      sponsor had permanent residence and accordingly was not required to be
      engaged in  any  qualifying  activity  in  order  to  reside  here  in
      accordance with the regulations.

  29. In order for the appellant himself  to  have  acquired  the  right  to
      reside in the UK permanently, he had to show that he resided in the UK
      in accordance with the regulations for at least five years. He  became
      a family member of a qualified person at the date of marriage,  namely
      on 28 January 2010 and was issued a residence card on  that  basis  in
      September that year.

  30. As at 28 January 2015 he had been residing in the  UK  as  the  direct
      family member of his wife for a period of five years.

  31. From the date of his  marriage  until  the  sponsor's  final  date  of
      employment he was a family member of an EEA national exercising Treaty
      rights as a worker. Thereafter he became the family member of  an  EEA
      national who had  a  right  of  permanent  residence  in  2012  having
      exercised Treaty rights as a worker since 2007.

  32. Ms Isherwood sought to contend at the hearing  that  the  sponsor  was
      however not entitled to permanent residence as she was only issued  an
      accession state worker registration certificate on 8 October 2008.

  33. However in the certificate issued to her it is in fact  recorded  that
      "Job start date is 8 November 2007". The  employer  is  ATFC  Ltd.  Ms
      Isherwood never referred to the content of the certificate itself.

  34. She had produced P60s from 2007 until 2012 confirming her  employment.
      None of this evidence was disputed by the respondent at any time.

  35. In any event, I do not at this late stage  permit  the  respondent  to
      take any point under the 2004 Accession Regulations.  This  has  never
      been referred to or relied on by the respondent at any stage. Nor  had
      any notice, written or otherwise, been given to the appellant  or  her
      solicitors prior to the date the hearing before the  Upper Tribunal.

  36. The respondent has at  all  times  accepted  that  the  sponsor  began
      working in the UK   in  November  2007  and  qualified  for  permanent
      residence in November 2012. She therefore no longer  needed  to  be  a
      qualified person for the purpose of the appellant's application.   Her
      entitlement to permanent residence continued after May 2013  when  her
      maternity pay ceased and has not since been lost.

  37. On the evidence before the Tribunal I find that the appellant has been
      residing with his sponsor for a period in excess of five  years  after
      the marriage in 2010. Accordingly, he is entitled to have  his  rights
      recognised by way of a permanent residence card.

  38. I accordingly find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      involved the making of an error on a point of law.

  39. In re-making the decision I refer to and incorporate my findings.

  40. I find that the appellant has acquired the right to reside in  the  UK
      permanently pursuant to Regulation 15(1)(b) of the 2006 Regulations.


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making  of  an
      error on a point of law. Having set aside the decision, I re-make  it,
      substituting for that decision a  decision  allowing  the  appellant's
      appeal.


      Anonymity direction made.


      Signed                             Date 15 October 2017
