                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL


1.   This is an appeal by the appellant,  a  citizen  of  India,  against  a
    determination of the First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal  against
    the  respondent's  decision  made  on  20  March  2013   refusing   his
    application of 19 December 2012 for further leave to remain as a Tier 2
    (General) Migrant.  The judge was not satisfied that he had  been  able
    to show that he met all the requirements of the rules and in particular
    para 245HD(d).

2.   The appellant was  granted  permission  to  appeal  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal in a decision dated 18 July 2013.  The  appeal  was  initially
    listed for hearing on 28 October 2013 but was adjourned to  enable  the
    appellant to amend his grounds to rely on the provisions of s.85A(3)(b)
    and (4)(d) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

3.   At the hearing before us on 5 November 2012 it was agreed  between  the
    parties that the respondent should be given leave under  r.17(1)(b)  of
    the 2008 Procedure Rules to withdraw her case and the decision  on  the
    application made on 19 December 2012  on  the  understanding  that  the
    appellant would be  granted  further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  2
    (General)  Migrant  for  three   years,   the   leave   being   granted
    expeditiously and in any event within two weeks from  6  November  2013
    and the appellant's passport being returned to him within that time.  A
    consent order has been submitted signed by both representatives.

4.   In the light of  the  consent  order  and  the  agreement  between  the
    parties, we consent to the withdrawal under r.17(2).  This decision  is
    to stand as the required notification under r.17(5).

Decision

5.   We record the Tribunal's consent  to  the  respondent  withdrawing  her
    case on the basis set out in the signed consent order  filed  with  the
    Tribunal.

6.   It was agreed at the hearing that  the  anonymity  order  made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal  served  no  obvious  purpose  and  that  order  is
    discharged.





Signed                                  Date: 15 November 2013
