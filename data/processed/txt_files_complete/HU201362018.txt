Representation:
For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Mrs S Rushforth, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   In a decision sent on 28 December 2018 Judge  Monaghan  of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (FtT) dismissed the appeal of the appellant, a citizen of
    Nigeria, against the decision made by the respondent  on  13  September
    2018 to refuse leave to remain in the UK.

2.   The appellant's principal ground of appeal was that  the  judge  failed
    to mention anything about the letter sent on 27 September 2018 from her
    doctor saying she was medically unfit to travel.

3.   At the hearing  there  was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant but she had sent  a  letter  stating  she  would  not  attend
    because of her health but that she  wished  her  appeal  to  go  ahead.
    Having considered the file particulars, I was satisfied it was  in  the
    interests of justice to proceed with the hearing in the absence of  one
    of the parties.  I then heard brief  submissions  from  Mrs  Rushforth
    opposing the appellant's grounds of appeal.

4.   As regards the appellant's principal ground of appeal, I  would  accept
    that the judge erred in not taking into account the  statement  in  the
    letter of 27 September 2018 from her doctor, Dr Button.   At  paragraph
    4(ix) the judge had stated that "[i]t has not been suggested  that  the
    appellant is unfit to travel."  Clearly  the  letter  of  27  September
    amounted to at least a suggestion that medical unfitness to travel  was
    a problem in September.  However, I do not consider that this error was
    a material one.  First of all, the  judge  was  clearly  aware  of  the
    particulars of the appellant's medical history.  At  paragraph  13  she
    stated:

         "13. I have before me in the Respondent's bundle a detailed  letter
             from Dr  Jennefe  Button  (30/08/2018).  This  sets  out  full
             details of the Appellant's previous diagnoses of  uncontrolled
             hypertension   (20/11/2017),   Insulin   dependent    Diabetes
             (06/12/2017),  an  infected  necrosis  of  the  left   buttock
             (24/05/2018)  and  renal  impairment/kidney  injury  stage   3
             (15/06/2018),  secondary  renal   anaemia   requiring   weekly
             injections, now discontinued  and  proteinuria  investigations
             which may result in a referral back to  secondary  care.   The
             costs in relation to Diabetes and renal problems is said to be
             unknown.  However, Dr Button has set out the charges  made  in
             respect of the two acute admissions in the sum of  �1,252  and
             �10,921. The total known charges are therefore �12,173. It  is
             clear from the letter that further costs  have  been  incurred
             but Dr Button is unable to attribute a cost to these."

5.   Secondly, the letter of 27 September 2018, although it did  state  that
    the appellant was medically unfit to travel at  that  time,  only  said
    that she was "currently medically unfit to travel" and  manifestly  did
    not state that this was a permanent feature of her condition.  That  is
    significant because it was dated over two months  before  the  hearing.
    Thirdly, for an appellant to be able to succeed in  a  claim  that  she
    could not travel outside the UK, there would need to be not only up-to-
    date medical evidence but medical evidence that specified why that  was
    the case.  On the evidence before the  judge  she  had  travelled  from
    Nigeria to the UK as recently as February 2017 and was not said  to  be
    unfit to travel in August 2018.  None of her medical conditions as such
    precluded the ability to travel abroad.  Fourthly,  the  appellant  had
    requested that the appeal before the FtT Judge be heard on the  papers,
    thereby electing to deny herself the opportunity to demonstrate at  the
    hearing that she was unfit to travel.

6.   As regards the appellant's other grounds of appeal, none of  them  does
    any more than  voice  mere  disagreement  with  the  judge's  principal
    finding of fact.

7.   The appellant states that she objects to the  judge's  assessment  that
    she relies on others for support (see  paragraph  36),  but  the  judge
    found, and the appellant does not  dispute,   that  she  is  maintained
    financially by her husband.  In my view that is all the judge meant  by
    'others' in paragraph 36.

8.   The appellant states that her husband paid for her son before she  made
    her visa application on 20 October 2017 in the sum of  �388.   However,
    the judge does not as such dispute that, stating at paragraph 15:

         "15. The Appellant for her part, in one of two letters  written  by
             her and contained within the  Respondent's  bundle  refers  to
             having to be admitted  to  hospital  in  connection  with  her
             pregnancy and as part of the process having  a  hospital  scan
             which her husband paid cash for. I am not told the amount  nor
             provided with any evidence of this such as a receipt.  It  may
             well explain however the discrepancy between the sum quoted in
             the GP letter and the sum quoted in the refusal letter,  which
             is for a lesser amount."

9.   In any event, whatever the position about the amount  of  the  sum  and
    who paid for it, it is clear that the appellant owed at least  �500  to
    the NHS, if not considerably  more:  see  paragraph  16.   The  judge's
    concluded at paragraphs 17 and 18:

         "17. The Appellant has not submitted  any  evidence  to  show  that
             these outstanding charges have been met. Other  than  the  one
             reference to paying for one scan in cash,  the  Appellant  has
             not dealt with this ground for refusal.


         18.  I therefore find that the Respondent has  established  to  the
             standard required that the  Appellant  is  in  breach  of  the
             stated paragraph in the suitability requirements."

    Such  a  conclusion  was  entirely  within  the  range  of   reasonable
    requirements.  Manifestly, whatever  the  precise  discrepancy  in  the
    amount owed it was at least �500 and accordingly the  appellant  failed
    to meet paragraph S-LTR4.5 of the Rules.

10.  The appellant complains that the judge wrongly referred to her  mother-
    in-law as her mother in paragraph 27.  That is correct, but is  clearly
    a typo as the judge had correctly set out earlier in paragraph 26  that
    she and her partner "live with his mother who is now 75" and the mother
    referred to in paragraph 27 can only have  been  this  woman,  not  the
    appellant's mother.

11.  The appellant appears to argue  that  the  fact  that  the  appellant's
    mother was now 76, not in very good health and "not  strong  enough  to
    travel" made the decision to refuse  her  leave  disproportionate,  but
    there was no medical evidence before the judge that  the  mother-in-law
    was unfit to  travel  and  hence  there  was  no  error  in  the  judge
    concluding she could travel if called upon.

12.  The appellant's grounds state that the judge made  no  mention  of  the
    death of her auntie, but there was no evidence about  this  before  the
    judge and the grounds fail to substantiate it to any degree.

13.  The appellant states that the judge wrongly described  the  appellant's
    partner as a businessman when he was employed,  but  that  is  how  she
    described him in her application and it was the basis of her claim that
    he earned sufficient to support the appellant.  She  had  provided  his
    employment letter and pay slips.

14.  The appellant maintains that the judge did not  mention  that  she  was
    born in Borno State, but the judge's  assessment  was  in  relation  to
    Nigeria generally and in the absence of any evidence of risk on  return
    to the appellant anywhere in Nigeria, that was sufficient.

15.  I have perused the judge's decision  for  myself  but  can  discern  no
    error of any kind.  On the evidence  before  the  judge  the  appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules and had failed
    to show there  were  compelling  circumstances  outside  the  Rules  to
    warrant a grant of leave.

No anonymity direction is made.
