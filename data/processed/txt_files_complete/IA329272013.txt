                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge M
         A Hall promulgated on the 22  November  2016  in  which  the  Judge
         dismissed the appeal.

      2. The appellant is a citizen of Kenya born on the 6 May 1948.  Having
         considered  the  evidence  with  the  required  degree  of  anxious
         scrutiny the Judge sets out his findings from [26] of the  decision
         under challenge which may be summarised as follows:



           a. The appellant entered the United  Kingdom  as  a  visitor  in
              August 2012  with  leave  valid  to  14  February  2013.  The
              application for leave to remain based on family  and  private
              life was made before the expiry of that leave [27].

           b. The appellant visited the UK previously. He and  the  sponsor
              married in the UK  on  3  May  1980.  The  sponsor  left  the
              appellant and her children in Kenya in 1995 to  live  in  the
              United Kingdom. She was granted indefinite leave to remain in
              December 2004 [28].

           c. The appellant has visited the United Kingdom on a  number  of
              occasions but lived apart voluntarily between 1995  and  2012
              with the sponsor visiting Kenya to see her family once a year
              [29].

           d. The appellant and sponsor have two adult children one  living
              in the United Kingdom and the other in Kenya.  Their  son  in
              Kenya is self-employed, single  and  29  years  of  age.  The
              appellant's granddaughter in the United Kingdom is 8 years of
              age [30].

           e. The appellant was diagnosed with HIV  in  2005  and  Type  II
              diabetes and had multiple strokes before entering the  United
              Kingdom  which  left  him  with  impaired  gait  and   speech
              according to a NHS letter dated 10 May 2013 [31].

           f. In January 2013, the appellant was admitted to hospital on an
              emergency basis and subsequently  diagnosed  with  end  stage
              kidney disease and also dementia and hypertension [32].

           g. The appellant has lived with the sponsor  since  August  2012
              although spent substantial periods of time in  hospital.  The
              appellant's adult daughter and granddaughter do not live with
              the sponsor [33].

           h. The Judge was satisfied the appellant has  family  life  with
              the sponsor as husband  wife,  that  the  appellant  has  not
              established family life that would engage article 8 with  his
              adult daughter as there was no evidence of  dependency  above
              normal emotional ties, but it was accepted the appellant  had
              established family life that would engage article 8 with  his
              granddaughter [37].

           i. The Judge finds the decision is in accordance  with  the  law
              and that the issue in the appeal related  to  proportionality
              [39 - 41].

           j.  The  Judge  found  he  must  take  into  account  the   very
              significant cost to the National Health Service  of  treating
              the appellant. The sponsor gave evidence that  the  appellant
              had received a bill from the NHS of approximately �13,000  in
              2013 for the early stages of treatment. The sponsor confirmed
              initially that �100 was  paid  towards  the  bill  which  was
              passed to a debt collection agency in relation to  which  the
              sponsor has agreed to pay �10 per month  but  is  unsure  how
              much  has  been  paid.  The  Judge  found   the   appellant's
              treatment, which includes dialysis three times a  week,  will
              have far exceeded the sum of �13,000. The cost  of  treatment
              is far higher in the United Kingdom than in Kenya. It was not
              found realistic the appellant will be able to  reimburse  the
              NHS for the cost of the  treatment  received  in  the  United
              Kingdom [45].

           k. The appellant had adequate medical treatment before  entering
              the United  Kingdom  although  it  did  not  include  medical
              conditions diagnosed since his arrival. The sponsor confirmed
              the appellant  was  able  to  have  treatment  in  a  private
              hospital and that he had a health scheme which meant  he  did
              not have to pay all the costs. The appellant was able to  pay
              for home help. The family home in Kenya is  currently  rented
              to tenants and the income from that assists with  payment  of
              legal fees [46].

           l. Medical treatment for  the  sponsor's  medical  condition  is
              available in Kenya in relation to which the Judge  refers  to
              comparative cost [47].

           m. The appellant's family will be able to offer  some  financial
              assistance with medical care. The sponsor  is  able  to  make
              some payments towards his  healthcare  and  currently  has  a
              reduced income as she is not working full-time because she is
              caring for the appellant [48].

           n. Family life established between the sponsor and appellant was
              not established when the appellant was in the United  Kingdom
              with precarious status and has not been in the United Kingdom
              unlawfully [49].

           o. The  Judge  attaches  significant  weight  to  the  fact  the
              appellant cannot meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
              Rules [50].

           p. The Judge concluded he must place significant weight  on  the
              fact there is a very significant cost to the NHS in providing
              the appellant with the medical care that he requires in  this
              country [51].

           q. The weight to be attached the  public  interest  exceeds  the
              weight to be attached to the wishes of the appellant and  his
              family that he remains  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Judge
              accepted a doctor's letter stating at the  present  time  the
              appellant is not fit to fly but that the decision is that the
              appellant is not entitled to leave to remain as  his  removal
              would not breach article 8 and therefore when he  is  fit  to
              fly  his  removal  from   the   United   Kingdom   would   be
              proportionate taking into account the public interest [52].



      3. The appellant sought permission to  appeal  which  was  granted  by
         another judge of the First-tier Tribunal the operative part of  the
         grant being in the following terms:


             "2. The grounds assert that the  judge  failed  to  conduct  a
             proper balancing exercise but demonstrated a  flawed  approach
             to the issue of proportionality. Having found the family  life
             exists  between   the   Appellant   and   his   Sponsor   (and
             granddaughter)  the  judge  placed  no   weight   upon   those
             relationships. The judge at [52] attached  significant  weight
             to the cost to the NHS of the appellant's treatment in the  UK
             and found that weight exceeds the weight to be attached to the
             wishes of the Appellant and his family that he remains in  the
             UK. There is no analysis whatsoever of  the  position  of  the
             appellant's wife. The family life that exists should have been
             considered from the viewpoint of all other family members. The
             judge's  findings  upon  proportionality  are   unclear.   The
             questions  raised  are  fundamental  to  the  appeal  but  are
             entirely unaddressed in the  decision.  The  judge  failed  to
             place any actual  weight  upon  the  appellant's  family  life
             grounds and the position of the appellant's  wife.  The  judge
             found that the appellant is not fit to fly [52] but that  when
             he is fit to fly his removal would be proportionate. It is the
             task of the judge to decide the appellant's  appeal  upon  the
             circumstances prevailing at the date of the hearing.  At  that
             time the appellant could not be removed as he was not  fit  to
             fly. The judge erred in law.


             3. In an otherwise careful and focused decision  and  reasons,
             it is nonetheless apparent  that  the  judge  found  that  the
             appellant at the date of the hearing was  not  fit  to  fly/be
             removed from the United Kingdom. The judge  went  on  to  find
             that when he is fit to fly, the appellant's removal  from  the
             United Kingdom would be proportionate taking into account  the
             public interest. That is a difficult finding to  maintain.  It
             is at least arguable that the  judge  cannot  properly  decide
             what the future circumstances would be when the appellant  was
             fit  to  fly.  It  is  at  least   arguable   that   a   fresh
             proportionality balancing exercise  should  be  undertaken  on
             what may be changed circumstances at that  time.  In  all  the
             circumstances  it  is  at  least  arguable  that  the  judge's
             findings are inconsistent and that the  inconsistency  amounts
             to a material error of law."



      4. The Secretary of State opposes the appeal asserting in the Rule  24
         response of 19 July 2017 that:


             "3. It is submitted that the appellant's grounds of appeal are
             misconceived. It is self-evident that the  FTI  J  takes  into
             account the family life  of  all  members  of  the  family  at
             paragraph 36 when the FTI J invokes Beoku  Betts,  the  FTI  J
             then finds that family life exists between A  and  P  and  his
             granddaughter. At no point, as alleged in the grounds does the
             FTI J states that he gives no weight to that family  life,  in
             fact the FTI J notes @49 that FL was not contracted  whilst  A
             was in the UK unlawfully or precariously.


             It is submitted that had the FTI J  only  taken  into  account
             matters pertaining to the date of hearing, as asserted in  the
             grounds, then the appellant could not have  succeeded  in  any
             event. If the appellant could not leave the UK because he  was
             unfit to fly then there  will  be  no  interference  with  his
             family life."




Error of law


      5. The Judge was tasked with considering the appellant's appeal at the
         date of the hearing. The appeal, on  article  8  grounds,  asserted
         that any interference with the protected right relied upon  by  the
         appellant and other family  members  was  disproportionate  to  the
         legitimate aim pleaded by the Secretary of  State,  i.e.  that  any
         interference was not warranted.

      6. The Judge was required to determine the position at the date of the
         hearing with a view to what may happen  if  the  decision  appealed
         against stands and removal from the United Kingdom occurs.

      7. The assertion the Judge failed to take into account the position of
         other family members has no arguable merit as the Judge was clearly
         aware of the existence of a wife, daughter  and  granddaughter  and
         make specific findings in  relation  to  family  life  that  exists
         between the appellant and these  family  members.  The  Judge,  for
         example, finds that family life  recognised  by  article  8  exists
         between the wife and the granddaughter but not the daughter. It  is
         not suggested that the granddaughter will do  anything  other  than
         stay with her own parents in  the  United  Kingdom  with  no  issue
         arising of the best interests of the granddaughter being  adversely
         affected as a result of the impugned decision.

      8. In relation to the appellant's wife, the Judge noted the  fact  she
         had reduced hours to care for the appellant and  the  support  that
         she was giving the appellant in the United Kingdom,  but  also  the
         support she would be able to give if  he  is  returned.  The  Judge
         noted the oral and written evidence from this source and it is  not
         made out that being aware of the appropriate  legal  test  and  the
         evidence made available, this experienced judge would  have  failed
         to factor the material into the proportionality assessment. Indeed,
         the Judge notes that there is a very significant public interest in
         maintaining effective immigration control  and  places  substantial
         weight upon the fact the appellant cannot meet the requirements  of
         the Immigration Rules and also significant weight on the fact there
         is a very significant cost to the NHS in  providing  the  appellant
         with the medical care that he requires. At [52] the  Judge  clearly
         draws together the threads of  the  evidential  and  legal  process
         making specific reference  to  the  fact  that  the  weight  to  be
         attached to the respondent's position  exceeds  the  weight  to  be
         attached to the wishes of the appellant and his family. Whilst  the
         Judge may not have  set  out  chapter  and  verse  on  findings  in
         relation to each and every aspect relied upon  it  is  clear  these
         matters were considered and it is not made out that the outcome  of
         the proportionality exercise is infected by  arguable  legal  error
         based upon the assertion the Judge failed to deal with  the  impact
         on the wife and the family. This information was clearly  contained
         in the appellant's wife's  witness  statements  and  oral  evidence
         noted by the Judge.

      9. Mr Kotas also referred to the skeleton argument  presented  to  the
         First-tier Tribunal dated 9 November 2016 and the  fact  the  Judge
         analyse the article 8 assessment  on  the  basis  advanced  by  the
         appellant. It was submitted, for example, that in the  two  witness
         statements provided by the appellant's wife that of 27 June 2014 is
         brief with the emphasis being on the impact for the  appellant  and
         what the appellant's wife did for him,  and  the  second  statement
         referring to the fact that health was not the only issue  but  also
         the fact there are family  in  the  United  Kingdom  including  the
         daughter, but with the overwhelming emphasis of the evidence  being
         on the impact on  the  appellant  and  the  appellant's  health  of
         removal. It is arguable that the case presented to the Judge was an
         article 8 medical case in which  the  appellant's  wife  failed  to
         adduce sufficient evidence to establish that her own situation  was
         sufficient to tip the balancing exercise in the appellant's favour.

     10. In relation to the issue of the  Judges  reference  at  [52]  to  a
         letter from a Dr Borrows, this is clearly a  matter  of  which  the
         Judge was fully aware. There is within the  bundle  filed  for  the
         purposes of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal a  number  of
         letters  relating  to  the  appellant's  medical  situation.  These
         include correspondence dated 6 March 2013, 10  May  2013,  17  June
         2013, 26 September 2016 and the additional correspondence  referred
         to by the Judge at [22] dated 8 November 2016. The Judge noted what
         Dr Borrows said about the medication  the  appellant  required  and
         that he receives dialysis three days a week and indicating that the
         doctor would not be surprised if the appellant were to  die  within
         six months and that at the present time, and unless  or  until  the
         overall position changes, the appellant is unfit to travel by air.

     11. The grounds do not seek to rely upon articles 3 ECHR and  presented
         the case by reference to Article 8 ECHR and the Immigration  Rules.
         It is not made out the Judge made any arguable legal error material
         to the decision to dismiss the appeal by reference to the Rules.

     12. On the basis of the Judges assessment of  the  balancing  exercise,
         ignoring the letter from Dr Burrows for this moment, there  appears
         to be no arguable legal error material to the decision made out  on
         the basis the Judge was aware of the appellant's medical  condition
         and concluded that adequate medical facilities  are  available  for
         the appellant's treatment in Kenya. It was not made out  that  such
         treatment was not available, including  dialysis,  as  there  is  a
         specific reference to this in [47] of the decision under challenge.
         The Judge also found the appellant's family will be able  to  offer
         some financial assistance with medical care.

     13. The Judge also paid specific attention to the guidance provided  by
         the Upper Tribunal in Akhalu [2013] UKUT 00400. The  Judge  clearly
         took into  account  that  the  countervailing  public  interest  in
         removal will only be outweighed by the consequences for the  health
         of the appellant because of any disparity of health care facilities
         in all but a very few  rare  cases  and  that  the  consequence  of
         removal for the health of the appellant who would not  be  able  to
         access equivalent healthcare in Kenya was clearly relevant  to  the
         question of proportionality, but  that  when  weighed  against  the
         public interest in ensuring that  the  limited  resources  of  this
         country's health service are  used  to  the  best  effect  for  the
         benefit of those for whom they are intended, those consequences  do
         not weigh heavily in the appellant's favour but speak  cogently  in
         support of the public interests in removal in this case.

     14. The evidence clearly supported the finding  that  at  the  date  of
         hearing the respondents had discharged the burden of proof upon her
         to  the  required  standard  to  show   that   the   decision   was
         proportionate.

     15. An example another case involving kidney failure is that  of  MT  v
         Sweden (Application no. 1412/12) ECtHR (Fifth Section) which was  a
         case concerning the availability and  access  to  adequate  medical
         treatment for kidney failure to an applicant who was to be expelled
         to Kyrgyzstan. Relying on Article  3,  the  applicant  argued  that
         adequate medical care was not available to him in  Kyrgyzstan  that
         he would die within a few weeks in the event of his  forced  return
         there. The ECtHR ruled that there was no violation of Article 3  in
         the event of his expulsion.

     16. The question that arises in relation to the letter from the  doctor
         is whether that suggests the Judge should have taken  into  account
         the situation that existed at the date  of  hearing,  in  a  manner
         other than that which he did, that would  have  a  material  impact
         upon the decision.  The  statement  by  the  Judge  that  when  the
         appellant is fit to fly his removal from the United Kingdom will be
         proportionate is finding reasonably open to  the  Judge  when  that
         question is assessed on the basis of the information  that  existed
         at the date of the hearing. The Judge  could  have  added  a  rider
         "subject to any later developments" but omitting the same does  not
         arguably give rise to an error of law material to the  decision  to
         dismiss the appeal. One issue faced by the Judge is that it is  not
         known how long the appellant would remain unfit to fly  or  whether
         if the  appeal  failed  and  removal  became  imminent  appropriate
         arrangements could be made. The evidence before the Judge did  also
         not indicate that the inability  of  the  appellant  to  fly  is  a
         permanent state of affairs.  The  appellant  is  not  on  permanent
         dialysis and failed to adduce evidence to suggest that  if  he  had
         dialysis or treatment in a planned manner on a particular day  that
         he would not be able to fly to Kenya to  liaise  with  the  medical
         authorities  to  enable  him  to  continue  his   treatment   there
         immediately after arrival.

     17. This case is not pleaded as a "death-bed" case pursuant to  article
         3 and the Judge found that adequate medical  treatment  existed  in
         Kenya.

     18. The other point to note is that the  statement  by  Dr  Burrows  is
         conditional namely "at the present time" and "unless or  until  the
         overall position changes". What that evidence did not  do  show  is
         there was any insurmountable obstacle or anything relating  to  the
         appellants medical condition that was sufficient to  indicate  that
         this factor makes out arguable legal error material to the decision
         to dismiss the appeal. The appellant will always have the right  to
         make a further application if circumstances warrant which will have
         to be considered and either refused  with  a  right  of  appeal  or
         certified as not amounting to a fresh claim by the respondent which
         will then give rise to either an appeal or application  by  way  of
         Judicial Review.

     19. This is not a case involving an organ transplant and it  cannot  be
         said  the  Judges  conclusions  are  outside  the  range  of  those
         reasonably available to him on the basis of the facts and  relevant
         and applicable legal provisions. The understandable  desire  for  a
         different outcome in the mind of the appellant and the family  does
         not, per se, make out arguable legal error.  Article  8  is  not  a
         mechanism which entitles a person to choose where they wish to live
         and the government  of  the  United  Kingdom,  in  accordance  with
         applicable legal provisions and its margin of appreciation in  such
         matters, has declined to allow the appellant to remain  in  the  UK
         with his resultant use of the facilities of the NHS.

     20. Appeal dismissed.
