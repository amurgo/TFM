                                   Between

                           (1) Miss Almas Sohail;
                            (2) Mr Jahangir Khan
                          (No anonymity order made)
                                                                  Appellants

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Z Choudhury (solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart (HOPO)


                CONSENT TO WITHDRAWAL OF THE APPELLANTS' CASE
  (Pursuant to Rule 17(2) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                                    2008)


 1. The Appellants sought permission to appeal against the determination of
    Judge Birrell, who in the case of the first  Appellant,  Almas  Sohail,
    gave a determination promulgated on 12th March 2014, and in the case of
    the second Appellant, Jahangir Khan, gave a  determination  promulgated
    on 26th March 2014.

 2. In both cases, he  dismissed  the  appeals  of  both  these  Appellants
    against the decision of the Respondent to refuse their application made
    on 21st December 2010  for  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  as  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrants under the points-based system.

 3. This decision was made on 11th November 2013.

 4. Permission to appeal was granted on 14th April 2014, which has  led  to
    the hearing before me.

 5. However, on the hearing date before me on 13th June 2014, Mr  N  Smart,
    appearing as the Home Office Presenting Officer, asked  for  permission
    to be allowed to withdraw the decision of  the  Respondent  dated  11th
    November 2013, which was based upon an allegation of fraud made against
    both  these  Appellants,  but  which  remains  unsubstantiated  in  the
    documentation, both before the First-tier Tribunal Judge, and before me
    today.

 6. Accordingly,  pursuant  to  Upper  Tribunal  procedure  Rule  17(2),  I
    consented to withdrawal by the Respondent Secretary  of  State  of  her
    case with the consequence that the original decision of the Immigration
    Judge still stands.
