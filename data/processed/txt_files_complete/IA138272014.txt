                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     The appellant did not appear and was nor represented
For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant has been granted permission to appeal against a decision
      of First-tier Tribunal Judge Blake who, by a determination promulgated
      on 7 November 2014, dismissed his appeal against a  refusal  to  issue
      him with a residence card as the spouse, and so the family member,  of
      an EEA national exercising Treaty rights in the United Kingdom.


   2. That decision to refuse  to  issue  a  residence  card  has  now  been
      withdrawn by the respondent and, as the appellant has now been  issued
      with the residence card he sought, the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is
      now academic. For that reason, and on that basis without the  need  to
      consider the merits of the grounds advanced, the appeal to  the  Upper
      Tribunal is dismissed.
