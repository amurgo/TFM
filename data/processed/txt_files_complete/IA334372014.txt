For the Respondent:    Ms E Rutherford, instructed by Fountain Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals with good reason to the  Upper  Tribunal
    against the decision and reasons statement of First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Stokes that was promulgated on 17 November 2014.  I say there  is  good
    reason for the appeal because as Ms Rutherford accepted Judge  Stokes's
    decision contains legal errors which mean it must be set aside.

 2. Because of the agreement of the parties there is no need to set out the
    legal errors in detail.  There were two  issues  for  Judge  Stokes  to
    determine: (i) did Mr  Mudassar  meet  the  financial  requirements  of
    appendix FM to the immigration rules, and (ii) if not, did  he  succeed
    under paragraph EX.1 of appendix FM.  The grounds of appeal  argue,  in
    essence, that Judge Stokes failed to apply relevant legal principles in
    relation to the first ground  and  that  he  failed  to  make  relevant
    findings in relation to the second.

The first issue

 3. Ms Rutherford conceded the first issue.  It is enough to say that Judge
    Stokes failed to engage with the evidential requirements  of  paragraph
    13 of appendix FM-SE. Mr Mudassar was only able to rely on the evidence
    submitted with the application with the exception that the Home  Office
    gave him additional time to submit his wife's SA300 or  SA302  for  the
    2012/2013 tax year (see Home Office letter of 18 March 2014).  Although
    Mr Mudassar did not comply with that request, at paragraphs 18  and  21
    Judge Stokes found that  the  law  entitled  him  to  take  account  of
    evidence not submitted with the application or prior  to  the  date  of
    decision.  He had no power in law to do so.

The second issue

 4. Before looking at the second issue, it is appropriate to  set  out  the
    relevant legal provisions.

Relevant legal provisions

 5. On 10 July 2014, the Secretary of  State  published  the  Statement  of
    Changes in  Immigration  Rules  (HC532)  in  which  she  announced  the
    insertion  of  paragraph  EX.2  to  appendix  FM.   The  implementation
    provisions of HC532  confirmed  that  paragraph  EX.2  applied  to  any
    decision made on or after 28 July 2014.

 6. Paragraphs EX.1 and EX.2 provide exceptions to various requirements  of
    appendix FM and thereby an alternative path to  a  grant  of  leave  to
    remain (the ten year route as opposed to the five year route).  As  can
    be seen from the text below, paragraph EX.2  identifies  how  paragraph
    EX.1.(b) is to be interpreted.

         EX.1.    This paragraph applies if

         (a)  (i) the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
         relationship with a child who-

                  (aa) is under the age of 18 years, or was under the age of
                  18 years when the applicant was first granted leave on the
                  basis that this paragraph applied;

                  (bb) is in the UK;

                  (cc)  is  a  British  Citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                  continuously  for  at  least  the  7   years   immediately
                  preceding the date of application; and

             (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave
             the UK; or

         (b)  the applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK.

         EX.2.    For the purposes  of  paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
         obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which  would  be
         faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their  family
         life together outside the UK and which could  not  be  overcome  or
         would entail very serious  hardship  for  the  applicant  or  their
         partner.

 7. Prior to the coming into force of  paragraph  EX.2,  the  Tribunal  was
    bound by the interpretation of "insurmountable obstacles" by the  Court
    of Appeal's judgment in R (Agyarko & Ors) v SSHD [2015] EWCA  Civ  440.
    The Court of Appeal did not consider the  contents  of  paragraph  EX.2
    because it did not apply to the case it was  deciding.   The  Court  of
    Appeal had recourse to  the  article  8  ECHR  jurisprudence  regarding
    "insurmountable obstacles" and in so doing it examined a  much  broader
    understanding of the phrase than is found in paragraph EX.2.

 8. The Tribunal was also previously guided by R (Chen) v  SSHD  ((Appendix
    FM - Chikwamba - temporary separation - proportionality)  (IJR)  [2015]
    UKUT 189 (IAC) but, as with the Court of Appeal's judgment,  that  case
    turned on a meaning  of  "insurmountable  obstacle"  not  contained  in
    paragraph EX.2, which was not in force at the relevant time.

 9. In each of the above cases  the  decision  turned  on  whether  it  was
    proportionate to expect the foreign national partner to  leave  the  UK
    and apply from overseas if the UK settled partner was not  prepared  to
    relocate family life overseas.  Paragraph EX.2 does  not  include  such
    alternatives and requires consideration  of  whether  family  life  can
    continue overseas, subject to the  demonstration  of  very  significant
    obstacles that cannot be overcome or  very  significant  hardship  that
    would otherwise result for the appellant or partner.

Consideration

10. In this appeal  I  am  concerned  with  the  application  of  paragraph
    EX.1.(b) because it is accepted that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    financial requirement of appendix FM because he failed to  comply  with
    the evidential requirements of  appendix  FM-SE.   As  such  he  cannot
    succeed under the five year route for settlement as a partner.   If  he
    can show, however, that he falls  within  the  stated  exceptions,  his
    leave can be varied in country although under the ten  year  route  for
    settlement.

11. As the decision in this appeal was made on 8 August 2014,  the  parties
    agree that paragraph EX.2 applies to this appeal.

12. Ms Rutherford did not concede the second issue but made no submissions.
     She accepted that Judge Stokes was required to consider the provisions
    of EX.1 and that required consideration of EX.2.

13. It is evident from paragraph 23 of his decision that Judge  Stokes  did
    not make  any  relevant  findings  regarding  insurmountable  obstacles
    whatsoever.  Although he found that the Mr Mudassar's wife is a British
    citizen, that she has lived all her life in the  UK,  that  her  family
    were here, that she had been in permanent employment for  the  previous
    19 months and that she had established a business in the UK, he made no
    finding as to why leaving these behind would amount to very significant
    difficulties to  the  couple  continuing  their  family  life  together
    outside the UK and which could not be overcome  or  would  entail  very
    serious hardship.

14. Of course, the failure to  make  relevant  findings  amounts  to  legal
    error.

15. Because these legal errors go to the heart of  the  appeal  I  have  no
    choice but to set  the  decision  aside.   I  was  able  to  inform  Ms
    Pettersen and Ms Rutherford of this decision and invited their views on
    how I should proceed to remake the decision.

Remaking the decision

16. Although the  appeal  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  proceeded
    without a hearing because the lower appeal  fee  had  been  paid,  both
    representatives recognised they had requested an oral  hearing  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.  Ms Pettersen said the Home  Office  file  contained  a
    copy of PRJ Southern's standard  directions  that  indicated  that  the
    Upper Tribunal would proceed immediately to remake the decision  if  an
    error on a point of law  was  found.   Ms  Rutherford  was  content  to
    proceed and called Mr Mudassar and his wife, Mrs Parveen.

17. After giving them time to read their witness statements  of  21  August
    2014, each adopted their statement.  They were questioned in turn about
    the requirements of paragraphs EX.1 and  EX.2.   I  have  recorded  the
    questions and answers in the record of proceeding and it is unnecessary
    to rehearse them here other that to indicate  that  the  only  evidence
    which touches on  the  provisions  of  paragraph  EX.2  relate  to  Mrs
    Parveen.  Her evidence reminded me that she is a British citizen,  that
    she has lived in the UK all her life, that she is very westernised  and
    enjoys the freedom of  being  a  British  citizen  woman  in  terms  of
    equality. As a result she works, is free to go out on her own,  she  is
    free to drive and she has been free to set up her  own  business.   She
    views going to Pakistan as restricting those freedoms  because  of  the
    patriarchal nature of Pakistani society.

18. Before considering the submissions made, I mention the following.  When
    considering the meaning of insurmountable obstacles in paragraphs  EX.1
    I am restricted to the meaning given to that phrase in EX.2.  It is not
    appropriate to view the wording through the prism of earlier  case  law
    either from the UK or from the European Court of Human  Rights  because
    the immigration rules include their own interpretation.

19. In light of the documentary evidence which supports the  account  given
    by Mrs Parveen and bearing in mind that Ms Pettersen did not  make  any
    submission questioning the reliability of  Mrs  Parveen's  evidence,  I
    accept her account and recognise that moving to Pakistan would restrict
    significantly the freedoms she enjoys by right  as  a  British  citizen
    woman.

20. Recalling that the wording of paragraphs EX.1(b) and EX.2  specifically
    refer to whether family life could continue outside the UK,  I  invited
    Ms Pettersen to focus on whether the significant impact  relocation  to
    Pakistan would have on Mrs Parveen would amount  to  an  insurmountable
    obstacle within the meaning of EX.2.  Ms Pettersen submitted  that  Mrs
    Parveen was in this predicament because she chose to marry someone from
    Pakistan.  She also submitted that it was open to Mrs Parveen to remain
    in the UK whilst Mr Mudassar applies from overseas if he could not make
    another application in the UK.

21. With regard to the last submission,  Ms  Pettersen  and  Ms  Rutherford
    clarified that they understood that Mr Mudassar would  be  entitled  to
    make a fresh application whilst in the UK as long as he applied  within
    28 days from his appeal rights ending.  This was a result of his  leave
    continuing by operation  of  s.3C  of  the  Immigration  Act  1971  and
    paragraph E-LTRP.2.2(b) of appendix FM.  Whether that is correct is not
    a matter for me.

22. In light  of  this  clarification,  I  understand  this  submission  as
    suggesting that if the appeal were dismissed then there would be  other
    options for Mr Mudassar to secure a relevant immigration status in  the
    UK.  In effect, this is merely a version of the other submission  which
    argues that Mr Mudassar could return on his own to Pakistan to make  an
    entry clearance application.  Although these factors would be  relevant
    to a proportionality exercised under article 8(2) of the  human  rights
    convention, I remember that I am not considering  article  8  directly.
    As I reminded Ms Pettersen, paragraphs EX.1 and  EX.2  do  not  contain
    such  alternatives  and  focus  on  whether  there  are  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life together continuing outside the UK.

23. I asked Ms Pettersen to address me on whether expecting Mrs Parveen  to
    give up her rights as a British citizen woman, which she would have  to
    do if she were to go to Pakistan with her  husband  to  continue  their
    family  life  there,  would  amount  to  insurmountable  obstacles   as
    described in paragraph EX.2.

24. I reminded Ms Pettersen of the importance citizenship  rights  have  to
    migration law.  This principle was developed in the  case  of  McCarthy
    (European citizenship) case no C-434/09 [2011] Imm AR 586  wherein  the
    Court advised in paragraphs 53 and 54:

         53   Thus, in Ruiz Zambrano and Garc�a Avello, the national measure
         at issue had the effect of depriving Union citizens of the  genuine
         enjoyment of the substance of the rights  conferred  by  virtue  of
         that status or of impeding the exercise  of  their  right  of  free
         movement and residence within the territory of the Member States.

         54   As stated in paragraph 49 of  the  present  judgment,  in  the
         context of the main proceedings in this case,  the  fact  that  Mrs
         McCarthy, in addition to being a national of the United Kingdom, is
         also a national of Ireland does not mean that a  Member  State  has
         applied measures that have the  effect  of  depriving  her  of  the
         genuine enjoyment of the  substance  of  the  rights  conferred  by
         virtue of her status as a Union citizen or of impeding the exercise
         of her right of free movement and residence within the territory of
         the Member States. Accordingly, in such a context, such a factor is
         not sufficient, in itself, for a finding that the situation of  the
         person concerned is covered by Article 21 TFEU.

25. That case involved a dual British-Irish citizen (who had not  exercised
    any EU law rights relating to freedom of movement) who wanted her  non-
    EU citizen husband to remain in the UK.

26. The  Court  of  Justice  concluded  in  essence  that  although  it  is
    reasonable to expect family life to continue overseas  if  such  action
    will not deprive a Union citizen of the genuine substance of the rights
    they have in their member state of their nationality and  alternatively
    although it is reasonable to expect a married couple  to  be  separated
    for immigration purposes where such separation will not result  in  the
    Union  citizen  being  deprived  of  the  genuine  enjoyment  of  their
    citizenship rights, it is wrong in law to expect  a  Union  citizen  to
    leave the UK in order to continue family life overseas when  to  do  so
    would be to deprive her of the genuine  enjoyment  of  her  citizenship
    rights.

27. These provisions have been discussed on a number of  occasions  by  the
    Courts here, perhaps most recently in Pham v SSHD [2015] UKSC  19  (see
    paragraph 55 in particular).  Much of the  domestic  jurisprudence  has
    addressed cases of deportation, which it should be  remembered  is  not
    the case here.  Of course, the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  has
    reached similar conclusions in a number of cases as  discussed  by  the
    Court of Appeal in Agyarko and more recently in SSHD v SS (Congo) & Ors
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

28. I return to the wording of paragraphs EX.1 and  EX.2  and  recall  once
    again that  they  require  only  consideration  of  whether  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family  life  continuing  outside  the  UK.
    There is no space within the wording of these  provisions  to  consider
    the possibility that a temporary separation  for  immigration  purposes
    might be reasonable.

29. In this case, as I have indicated, I am satisfied  that  expecting  Mrs
    Parveen to move to Pakistan  to  continue  her  family  life  with  her
    husband in that country would deprive her of the genuine  enjoyment  of
    her citizenship rights.  She would not be in a position  to  enjoy  the
    freedoms she has as a Union citizen,  including  those  she  has  as  a
    British citizen, because of the discrimination of women in Pakistan. In
    reaching this decision I have drawn on  the  binding  guidance  of  the
    Court of Justice, that an expectation, whether actual or implied, for a
    Union citizen to give up the genuine  enjoyment  of  their  citizenship
    rights (and I recall that equality is a fundamental principle of EU law
    just as it is fundamental to UK law), is wrong in law because it  would
    impose very serious hardship on  Mrs  Parveen.     She  would  have  to
    choose between the family life with her  husband  -  which  is  not  in
    dispute - or her private life  because  of  her  rights  as  a  British
    citizen (which, of course, makes her a citizen of the EU).

Article 8

30. For the sake of clarity, I should record that if  paragraph  EX.2  were
    not in place, then I would have come  to  a  different  decision  under
    paragraph EX.1 as it  was  previously  understood  by  the  Courts  and
    Tribunal or under article 8 applied directly.

31. Although there is no dispute that  article  8(1)  is  engaged  in  this
    appeal, and thereby the first two Razgar steps are answered positively,
    following the guidance in Agyarko and Chen I would  be  bound  to  find
    that the available evidence did not show that it was not  proportionate
    to expect the  appellant  to  return  to  Pakistan  to  make  an  entry
    clearance application.  Any separation would be  proportionate  in  all
    the circumstances.  I would have reached the same conclusion in respect
    of EX.1 without EX.2 because the case law  confirmed  that  the  phrase
    "insurmountable obstacles" was the same in both contexts.

32. This is a case where the wording of  EX.2  creates  a  more  favourable
    immigration outcome for the appellant.  I  very  much  doubt  this  was
    intended but it is trite law that the immigration rules have to be read
    and interpreted as they are and not restricted by other legal  measures
    however authoritative.

Decision

The decision and reasons  statement  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Stokes
contains errors on points of law and is set aside.

I  remake  the  decision  and  allow  the  appellant's  appeal  against  the
immigration decision of 8 August 2014.
