                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.   I will refer to the appellants by their designation before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal notwithstanding that they are the respondents before  the
    Upper Tribunal.

2.   I will refer to the appellants collectively as  "the  appellants"  but,
    insofar as  it  is  relevant,  individually,  the  first  appellant  as
    "Sinavar", the second appellant as "Atousadat" and the third  appellant
    as "Sayed".

3.   The appellants are all Iranian nationals.  Their  dates  of  birth  are
    respectively 23 October 1969, 27 July 1995 and 12 November 2002.

4.   The respondent appeals to  the  Upper  Tribunal  with  permission  from
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Foudy who found that an arguable error of law
    in that the reasons for finding the removal of the appellants would  be
    unjustifiably harsh was inadequately reasoned and failed to address the
    issue of the appellants making further  entry  clearance  applications.
    Those grounds are dated 29 September 2014.  It does not appear that the
    appellant provided a Rule 24 response  to  those  grounds.   Notice  of
    directions were sent out on 12 November 2014 for the parties to file an
    indexed and paginated bundle of documents for use at  the  hearing  not
    later than 21 days before the hearing.  Those directions also  informed
    the parties that the Upper Tribunal would not  consider  evidence  that
    was not before the First-tier Tribunal and unless notice was  given  in
    advance by the party wishing to rely on such evidence,  indicating  the
    nature of the evidence and explaining why  it  had  not  been  produced
    before the lower Tribunal.

The Hearing

5.   Miss Everett relied on the grounds of appeal and said that no  adequate
    reason had been given by the Immigration Judge why the family could not
    return to Iran.  It was not "fanciful" to suggest that  they  could  do
    so, as the Immigration Judge appeared to suggest in paragraph 53 of his
    determination.  On the contrary, the children had only been in  the  UK
    for three years and six months as at the date of the hearing before the
    First-tier Tribunal.  The appellants are unable to meet the Immigration
    Rules and in view of that should go back  to  Iran  and  make  a  fresh
    application for settlement when and if they meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules.

6.   It was then submitted on behalf of the  appellant  by  reference  to  a
    substantial number of authorities contained in a bundle produced by him
    that "exceptional circumstances" was not the test  for  application  of
    Article  8  outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   I  was   referred,   in
    particular, to a case called  Oludoyi  [2014]  UKUT  00539  (IAC).   He
    referred particularly to paragraph 41 of that decision.  There,  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Gill said that a decision maker has a considerable
    margin within which to decide what weight to attach to  any  particular
    factor in the case before him.  He ought not to be criticised on appeal
    unless  the  reasons  he  gave  were  "Wednesbury  unreasonable".   The
    challenge to the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  this  case
    amounted to a disagreement with the outcome rather than  an  allegation
    that  it  was  Wednesbury   unreasonable.    Paragraph   38   of   this
    determination made clear the factors that the  Immigration  Judge  took
    into account, including the long residence in the UK.  The main  reason
    for finding in favour of  the  appellants  was  the  undesirability  of
    removing the children, the significance of the family life  established
    here, and the fact that the appellants had been "model  settlors".   It
    seemed to Mr Hodson that the appellants had  been  caught  out  by  the
    toughening of the Immigration  Rules  in  2012.   He  argued  that  the
    appellants had a legitimate expectation they would be allowed to  stay.
    The "best interests" of the children were a primary consideration.   In
    this connection I was referred to paragraph 44 of  the  case  of  Hayat
    [2011] UKUT 00444 (IAC) which  reconsidered  the  Chikwamba  principle.
    The issue there was whether  it  was  necessary  and  proportionate  to
    require the appellants to return to Iran and apply for entry  clearance
    (see paragraph 44 of Chikwamba).  The reason that the Immigration Judge
    found it inappropriate to require the appellant to return  to  Iran  to
    apply for entry clearance was explained fully in his determination, for
    example, in paragraph 53.  The Immigration Judge  had  looked  at  this
    issue adequately in his determination and it was unreasonable to expect
    the appellants to apply for entry clearance from abroad.

7.   The respondent said by way of reply that  Chikwamba  was  distinguished
    from the present case.  In particular, the appellants do not  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules at all, whereas in Chikwamba they would  have
    met the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  save  that  they  were
    applying from the UK rather  than  abroad.   Thus,  the  reasoning  was
    inadequate.  The sponsor had stayed in the UK voluntarily.

8.   I allowed Mr Hodson to make an additional submission.  He said that  in
    the event of an error  of  law  being  found  he  would  wish  to  make
    supplemental submissions whereas the respondent  was  content  for  the
    Tribunal to go on and re-decide the matter in the event that  an  error
    of law was found.  I explained to Mr Hodson that this is an appeal  and
    that the parties should make all their submissions at the  hearing.   I
    also stressed that it would be inappropriate to remit the matter to the
    First-tier Tribunal given that the Upper Tribunal  was  seized  of  the
    matter.

9.   At the end of the hearing I reserved my decision as to whether  or  not
    there was a material error of law and if so what to do about it.

Discussion

10.  The appellants are the wife and children of Mr Sayed  Mojiaba  Aldavoud
    (the sponsor).  The appellants and the sponsor are  Iranian  nationals.
    The sponsor first came to the UK on 1 July 2003 and made an  apparently
    spurious application for  asylum.   A  subsequent  appeal  against  the
    dismissal of that claim was also dismissed.   He  subsequently  made  a
    further claim for asylum which, according to him, was never determined.
     I understand there are practical difficulties to the sponsor's  return
    to Iran. However, it is not contended on behalf of the appellants  that
    the sponsor would be persecuted if he now returned to Iran.    In  2008
    the sponsor's solicitors applied under the "legacy"  scheme  and  after
    some delay the sponsor was given indefinite leave to  remain  (ILR)  in
    the UK.  He claims to run a business here selling Italian food products
    but at the date of the refusal (15 January 2014) it  appears  that  the
    company in which the sponsor had  an  interest,  was  not  showing  any
    marked profit.

11.  The first appellant, the sponsor's wife, came here in 2011  with  their
    two children, Atousadat, born 27 July 1995, and Sayed, born 12 November
    2002.  They were given two years' leave to enter which  expired  on  24
    June 2013.  On 12 June 2013 the appellants applied for ILR.

12.  Since the appellants entered the UK the  Immigration  Rules  have  been
    "toughened up" so that the maintenance requirements that  must  be  met
    are more stringent.  In order to qualify for ILR  the  appellants  must
    satisfy the requirements of paragraph 287, in the  case  of  the  first
    appellant and, paragraph 300 with reference to paragraph  298(I)  (a-d)
    of HC 395, as amended, in the case of the children.

13.  At the date the applications were determined the  first  appellant  and
    her children had only been in the UK for two years  and  seven  months.
    At the date of the hearing before the Upper Tribunal it was three years
    eight months.

14.  The family's financial  means  fell  significantly  below  the  minimum
    standard required by the Rules (�261.19 per week).  This  is  only  the
    equivalent of income support level for a British family of  this  size.
    The shortfall was a significant �111.18.

15.  The respondent criticises the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    allow the appellants' appeal against the refusal  of  ILR  because  she
    says no adequate reasons were given why this family should  not  return
    to Iran.  In particular, the sponsor was not a refugee and  there  were
    no insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  whole  family  returning  there,
    alternatively, the appellants returning there and  later  applying  for
    entry clearance if they met  the  requirements  of  the  rules.   Their
    relatively short period of residence in the  UK  did  not  justify  the
    conclusion that insurmountable obstacles to  their  return  there.   In
    addition, their failure to meet the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules was an important consideration and before the  Immigration  Judge
    considered exceptionally granting them ILR outside the Rules he  should
    have considered the possibility of their return  to  Iran  from  whence
    they could make a fresh application if and when the requirements of the
    Rules are met.

16.  The appellants' answer to these points is to say that they are no  more
    than a disagreement with the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal.   A
    margin of discretion  is  allowed  to  the  Immigration  Judge  who  is
    entitled  to  attach  weight  to  those  factors  he  perceives  to  be
    important.  The respondent had the burden of showing that the  decision
    was "Wednesbury unreasonable" and provided the  Immigration  Judge  did
    not take into account irrelevant factors or ignore relevant factors his
    decision was uncontroversial and should be allowed to stand.


Conclusions

17.  Helpfully, I have been provided with  a  bundle  of  recent  Article  8
    authorities by Mr Hodson, who appears for the appellants.   Insofar  as
    the case of Oludoyi  suggests  that  the  fact  that  an  immigrant  is
    entering the UK in a "shortage occupation"  is  a  relevant  factor  in
    deciding whether they qualify for Article 8, I am  not  convinced  that
    such conclusion is correct.  If it is a relevant factor, it is a factor
    of minor significance.  It is clear from  all  the  recent  authorities
    that the relevant starting position  is  to  consider  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Those considerations set out in the Rules are set out  also  in
    primary legislation as a result of the amendments to  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002  introduced  by  Section  19  of  the
    Immigration Act 2014.  The  public  interest  is  now  incorporated  in
    primary legislation which includes considering the


         "interests of the economic wellbeing of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons -


         (a)  are not a burden on the taxpayers ...".

18.   Unfortunately,  the  Immigration  Judge   failed   to   consider   the
    significant shortfall in the maintenance requirement in this  case  and
    the fact that it was likely if this family settled in the UK that  they
    would in fact become a burden on taxpayers.  As the  Immigration  Judge
    acknowledged, in paragraph 52  of  his  determination,  there  was  "no
    evidence" as  to  the  performance  of  the  company  the  sponsor  had
    established.  He attached excessive weight to the undesirability of the
    family relocating.  He characterised this himself in  paragraph  53  of
    his determination as "quite a serious matter".  I  do  not  read  those
    words to be the same as "insurmountable  obstacles".   The  Immigration
    Judge attached excessive weight to the  fact  that  the  children  were
    "established in the English style of education".  As he acknowledged in
    paragraph 51, they also spoke Farsi and had spent  the  bulk  of  their
    lives in Iran.  The fact that the family "wished to remain" in  the  UK
    was an irrelevant matter. The fact that the family were integrated into
    English society, had taken steps to learn English and that the  sponsor
    was doing his best to earn a living, were not  factors  to  which  such
    weight should be attached  as  to  override  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules which were in place for a good  reason.   The  family
    maintained close ties with Iran  where  the  first  appellant  has  her
    siblings living  and  with  whom  she  maintains  "some  contact"  (see
    paragraph 38 of the determination).  As the respondent pointed  out  in
    her refusal, "British culture,  society  and  way  of  life,  does  not
    automatically override or take precedence over Iran's  culture  or  its
    society ..." Indeed, it may well be that the appellants'  knowledge  of
    England and the English language may be an advantage to them  on  their
    return to Iran.

19.  Therefore, whilst I accept that the Immigration Judge  enjoyed  a  wide
    ambit of discretion within which reasonable disagreement was  possible,
    the short period of residence in the UK by the appellants  did  not  in
    any way justify the conclusion  that  it  would  "be  unreasonable"  to
    require the family to return to Iran.  Their settlement has  long  term
    consequences  for  the  wider  interests  of  society  with  which  the
    respondent is concerned.  It is not simply a case of examining  whether
    the parties are "model settlors", as the Immigration Judge  appears  to
    suggest in paragraph  53  of  his  determination.   The  respondent  is
    entitled to have in place  proper  rules  for  controlling  immigration
    which include meeting financial criteria.  These plainly were  not  met
    by these appellants, indeed, by a significant margin.  I  am  satisfied
    that  the  respondent  fully  took  into  account   his   international
    obligation incorporated into English law by Section 55 of the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 to treat the interests and welfare
    of the children as primary considerations.  The children are not to  be
    punished  for  the  failure  of  their  parents  to  regularise   their
    immigration status.   However,  the  appellants  and  the  sponsor  are
    foreign nationals who can safely return to Iran where all of them  have
    spent the bulk of their lives.

20.  I have considered the Chikwamba point but  agree  with  the  respondent
    that it is distinguished on its facts.  The point  that  the  House  of
    Lords made in that case (that the degree of disruption to  family  life
    will be a highly  material  factor  when  the  respondent  insists  the
    parties return to their home country to make a  fresh  application  for
    entry clearance) was in the context of a case where one or more of  the
    parties to return to Zimbabwe was unable to do so  even  if  they  were
    likely to meet the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   Therefore,
    there was considerably more justification needed for that  step  to  be
    required than in a case such as this in which the  appellants  fail  to
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at all, at least at  the
    time of the refusal.   There  are  good  and  substantial  reasons  for
    requiring these  appellants  to  return  to  Iran  and  make  a  proper
    application for entry clearance supported by evidence of the ability of
    the sponsor to maintain and support them  without  recourse  to  public
    funds.  I see nothing in the grant of a limited period of  leave  which
    gave rise to any "legitimate expectation" that the appellants would  be
    allowed to remain in the UK permanently.  I do not consider that it was
    enough merely to establish that  the  relationship  between  the  first
    appellant and the sponsor was genuine and subsisting. The appellant and
    the sponsor have children together, including Atousadat, who is now  an
    adult.  The respondent was entitled to insist that they had the ability
    to maintain themselves to the minimum standards set by the  Immigration
    Rules.  Unfortunately, they did not meet  those  minimum  requirements.
    It may well be that in future they do satisfy these requirements and  a
    fresh application can be made.

Notice of Decision

The appeal by  the  respondent  is  allowed.  The  Upper  Tribunal  finds  a
material  error  of  law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier   Tribunal.
Accordingly, that decision is set aside. The decision of the  respondent  to
refuse the appellants ILR was in accordance with the Immigration  Rules  and
in accordance with the ECHR.

No anonymity direction is made.
