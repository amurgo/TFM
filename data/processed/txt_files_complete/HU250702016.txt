                                     And

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                             Appellant in the Upper Tribunal

Representation:
For the Claimant:            Mr Georget (Counsel)
For the Secretary of State:  Miss Everett  (Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision of First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Colyer promulgated on the 5th June 2017, in  which
      she allowed the Claimant's appeal seeking Leave to Remain on the basis
      of his family and private life in the UK. As it is  the  Secretary  of
      State's appeal  I  will  refer  to  the  Secretary  of  State  as  the
      "Secretary of State" and  to  Mr  S.A.  as  the  "Claimant",  for  the
      purposes of clarity.

   2.  Within the Grounds of Appeal it is argued that the  Judge  materially
      misdirected  herself  when  considering  the  evidence  submitted   by
      Cheshire Constabulary in the case and that although  the  witness  who
      attended from Cheshire Constabulary did not have first-hand  knowledge
      of the Claimant's alleged conduct, it is argued they had access to the
      Cheshire Constabulary records of the Claimant's  offending  behaviour,
      which was argued to be reliable evidence which could be relied upon by
      the Tribunal.  It is argued that following  the  case  of  Farquharson
      (removal - proof of conduct) [2013] UKUT 00146 (IAC), that although  a
      criminal charge has not resulted in a conviction and is not a criminal
      record, the acts alleged to the charge may be established  as  conduct
      and that if the Secretary of State seeks to establish the  conduct  by
      reference to the context of police CRIS reports, the relevant document
      should be produced, rather than a bare witness statement referring  to
      them.

   3. In this case it is said that the Cheshire Constabulary's evidence  was
      provided to the Claimant's representative in good time  and  they  had
      ample opportunity of engaging and  rebutting  the  evidence,  but  had
      failed to do so. It is argued the Judge had failed to explain why that
      evidence provided by Cheshire Constabulary was  insufficient  and  why
      detailed  allegations  or  concerns  about  the  Claimant   exploiting
      vulnerable young females was not sufficient in that  regard.   It  was
      said the Claimant had  received  warnings  regarding  his  conduct  of
      harassing a young female and had breached  orders  preventing  contact
      with a young female who was the subject of a Care Order and that there
      had been allegations of violence against a  young  female  who  he  is
      ordered by the Court not to have contact with and yet he breached that
      and that charges were ultimately not pursued, as the  victim  who  the
      Claimant had continued to have contact with  him,  despite  the  Court
      Order and decided to withdraw her support.

   4. It is further argued that the evidence had also shown the Claimant had
      been found in possession of drugs and had  admitted  to  a  long  drug
      habit at the hearing and although he claimed  to  have  ceased  taking
      drugs there was no evidence of that.  It is argued that  the  presence
      of the Claimant in the UK is not conducive to the public good and  the
      Judge had failed to properly engage with the evidence provided.

   5.  In ground 2 it is argued that the Judge erred  in  finding  that  the
      Claimant was taking an active role in his child's upbringing and  that
      the Claimant had provided extremely limited  evidence  which  did  not
      support the Tribunal's findings and that  there  was  no  evidence  to
      support the ex-partner's evidence  that  the  child  stayed  with  the
      Claimant 3 to 4  days  per  week  and  that  there  should  have  been
      documentary evidence from independent sources as to  his  involvement.
      It is argued that the Tribunal failed to take account of the fact that
      the Claimant had been using 2 addresses and his ex-partner  could  not
      even confirm the Claimant's address, which was said to  undermine  his
      credibility in that regard.  It was further argued that there  was  no
      independent evidence of the Claimant providing ï¿½30 per week to his ex-
      partner for child maintenance as well as buying clothes and toys.

   6. Permission to appeal in this  case  had  been  granted  by  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Grant on the 11th December 2017 who found that  it  was
      arguable that the Judge failed to engage with the  evidence  provided,
      when making findings in accordance with Paragraph S-LTR1.6 and further
      it was argued that the Judge erred in finding that  the  Claimant  was
      taking an active role in his child's  upbringing  when  there  was  no
      independent evidence to corroborate the claims and his ex-partner  did
      not know the address  which  he  was  living  at  which  was  said  to
      undermine the credibility of the claim that the child stayed with  him
      there 3 to 4 times per week and in  light  of  the  lack  of  evidence
      regarding the support his ex-partner was given financially.

   7. I also heard and have taken account of the oral  submissions  by  both
      Miss Everett and Mr Georget.

      My findings on error of law and materiality

   8. In respect of the first ground of appeal, although it is  argued  that
      the Judge failed to properly take account of the  offending  behaviour
      revealed within Cheshire Constabulary records, the findings by  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Colyer were that PC Middlebrook  had  no  previous
      dealings with the Claimant personally and only came to the case on the
      Home Office/police liaison team Operation Nexus  (Galleon)  to  search
      the computer and produce relevant extracts of the material downloaded.



   9. The Judge noted at [40] that she had carefully considered the  reports
      and attachments and  the  information  outlined  in  the  reports  was
      probably accurate as to the data it purported  to  contain,  regarding
      details  of  the  complaint,  arrest,  response,  actions  taken   and
      conclusions, but went on to find that that did not mean  that  what  a
      witness was recorded as saying was necessarily accurate  or  true  and
      that the Secretary of State had not supplied any of the statements  of
      the witnesses to the alleged incidents and had not called any of those
      witnesses, complainants or other parties to the incidents, nor had the
      Secretary of State supplied any exhibits or other evidence in order to
      substantiate what were effectively mere allegations  contained  within
      the police logs and which she considered to be an  insufficient  basis
      on which to make significant findings  of  fact,  even  to  the  lower
      standard of proof on the balance of probabilities, rather than to  the
      criminal standard, to find that the Claimant had been  guilty  of  the
      conduct alleged.   Indeed,  the  Judge  noted  that  the  Tribunal  in
      Farquharson had stated specifically that:

      "Materials are like to be considered the more cogent, the greater  the
      extent to which it is supported by other relevant documents.   In  the
      present case we have searched  for  data  relating  to  the  incidents
      independent of the Complainant's narrative.  The CRIS  extracts  might
      have been supported by witness statements  made  by  forensic  medical
      examiners or eyewitnesses.  This will not always be necessary, and the
      Tribunal is not conducting a retrial, but it may well  prove  helpful.
      We anticipate that the CPS should be  able  to  assist  the  UKBA  and
      indeed the Tribunal  and  where  material  is  sensitive,  appropriate
      direction as to its return  and  use  can  be  made  if  requested  in
      advance".

      The Judge on the evidence before her was entitled  to  find  that  the
      Secretary of State had not proved  to  the  civil  standard  that  the
      assertions made in the Cheshire  Constabulary  documentation  provided
      had been made out simply on the basis of the information contained  on
      the  Cheshire  Police  databases,  NSPIS  command  and  control  crime
      recording system, the niche criminal intelligence reports and the  PNC
      police national computer.  The Judge clearly  had  engaged  with  that
      evidence, but found  that  evidence  was  insufficient  to  prove  the
      Claimant had actually engaged in such activities  rather  than  simply
      showing he had been accused of such activities. The Judge  highlighted
      the failure of the Secretary of State to produce witness statements or
      other testimony that could be  challenged  and  tested  regarding  its
      weight, in order to substantiate  the  allegations  made  against  the
      Claimant.  In the circumstances of this case, those were findings open
      to the Judge on  the  evidence  before  her.   She  has  properly  and
      adequately explained her reasons in that regard. Although the Claimant
      accepted he had previously taken drugs, his evidence was that was many
      years before and the Judge was entitled to accept that evidence.

  10. Further, in respect of the criticisms regarding  the  Judge's  finding
      that the Claimant was taking an active role in his child's upbringing,
      although criticism was made of there being no independent evidence  to
      corroborate the claim that the Claimant's child stayed with him 3 to 4
      days a week, in support of his ex-partner's evidence,  the  Judge  did
      hear from both the Claimant and his ex-partner  in  that  regard,  and
      clearly accepted the evidence of Miss R. and the  fact  that  her  son
      stays with his father (the Claimant) 3 to 4 days a week and that he is
      providing her with ï¿½30 per week cash in  child  maintenance  and  also
      buys toys and clothes for his child.  It is not an error of law for  a
      Judge to find a witness or a Claimant to be credible,  and  there  did
      not need to be supporting corroborative  evidence  for  the  Judge  to
      accept her  evidence  in  that  regard  if  she  found  that  evidence
      credible.

  11.  Although it is argued that the fact  that  she  could  not  give  the
      Claimant's address undermined her evidence in that regard,  the  clear
      oral evidence recorded in the  record  of  proceedings  was  that  the
      Claimant picked up his son from Miss R. and returned him to  her,  and
      not that she was actually picking the child up from his property,  but
      in any event, she was able to describe in her evidence (as recorded by
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge in the Record of Proceedings)  that  she
      had not been to his address but it was 5 minutes  travel  in  the  car
      from the child's school and the school was about a 5  minute  walk  to
      her house.

  12. I find that the findings made by the Judge in accepting that  evidence
      of Miss R. were open to her on the evidence, and is  not  perverse  or
      irrational.  It was further open to the Judge to accept  her  evidence
      that Miss R. was receiving ï¿½30 from the Claimant in child maintenance,
      together with him buying clothes and toys.  Even if the amount he  was
      providing was argued to be very small compared to his income of ï¿½1,000
      and that there was said to be not an adequate role in his  upbringing,
      the Judge was entitled, in light  of  the  amount  of  time  that  the
      Claimant spent with his son and the fact that financial provision  was
      being given, to find that that was  an  active  role  in  the  child's
      upbringing.  There is no set amount  of  an  income  that  has  to  be
      provided in child support or payments in kind, in order for  a  parent
      to be actively taking a role in his child's upbringing and  the  Judge
      took into consideration not  just  the  financial  payments,  but  the
      payments in kind and also significantly the time spent by the Claimant
      with his son.

  13. The Grounds of Appeal  therefore  do  not  in  themselves  reveal  any
      material error of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Colyer.

  14. However, at the appeal hearing I noted that First-tier Tribunal  Judge
      Colyer had allowed the appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  had
      specifically decided that having allowed the decision under the Rules,
      it was unnecessary to go on to consider the appeal under Article 8  on
      Human Rights grounds.  Given that the  Claimant  lodged  his  original
      Human Rights application on the 25th February 2016, and  the  date  of
      the Secretary of State's decision was the 3rd November 2016, this is a
      decision to which the  new  more  limited  right  of  appeal  applied,
      pursuant to Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
      2002, and the only permitted grounds of  appeal  were  those  set  out
      within Section 84 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,
      as amended.  In this case, the only applicable  ground  was  that  the
      decision was unlawful pursuant to Section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act
      1988.

  15. Miss Everett, acting quite properly and fully in accordance  with  her
      duty to the Tribunal, conceded that as the Immigration Rules had  been
      amended to reflect the Secretary of State's view on Article 8,  should
      I not agree with the Secretary of State in respect of the  Grounds  of
      Appeal, and should I find that First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  had
      adequately taken account of the evidence from  Cheshire  Constabulary,
      and made adequate findings in respect of the  Claimant's  conduct  not
      having been proved, and if I  were  to  find  that  Judge  Colyer  had
      adequately explained and  made  proper  findings  in  respect  of  the
      relationship the Claimant had with his son and that he was playing  an
      active role in his son's upbringing, then in such circumstances,  even
      though First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Colyer  was  legally  in  error  in
      allowing the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules,  rather  than  on
      Article 8 grounds, Miss Everett conceded,  acting  on  behalf  of  the
      Secretary of State, that in such circumstances the decision of  First-
      tier Tribunal Judge Colyer should be  set  aside  in  respect  of  the
      appeal having been allowed under the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  I
      should remake it, allowing the appeal on Human  Rights  grounds  under
      Article 8.  She conceded that it had not been argued before the First-
      tier Tribunal that the appeal should not have been allowed on  Article
      8 grounds if the Judge found that the Rules were in fact met and  that
      further, there was no evidence to  show  any  change  in  circumstance
      since the date of the Judge's decision.

  16. In making such concessions,  Miss  Everett  quite  properly  acted  in
      accordance with her duty to the Tribunal. In light of  the  concession
      made on behalf of the Secretary of State, I therefore do set aside the
      decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer, to  the  limited  extent
      that she allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules, but  preserve
      all of the other findings made by her, including that  the  provisions
      of the Immigration Rules were met, I do in  light  of  the  concession
      made remake the decision, allowing  the  Claimant's  appeal  on  Human
      Rights grounds under Article 8 in respect of his family  life  in  the
      UK.

  17. In making  such  a  decision,  I  have  fully  taken  account  of  the
      provisions of Section  117A-D  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
      Asylum Act 2002, and the fact that the  maintenance  of  an  effective
      immigration control is in the public interest, and that it is  in  the
      public interests that people who seek Leave  to  Remain  are  able  to
      speak English and are financially independent.  There  is  no  dispute
      that the  Claimant  is  able  to  speak  English  and  is  financially
      independent, as the evidence that he gave to the Tribunal was that  he
      earned ï¿½1,000 per month, which was  accepted  by  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge Colyer.  He also gave  evidence  in  English  to  the  Tribunal.
      Further, although little weight should be  given  to  a  private  life
      established at a time when the Claimant is in  the  UK  unlawfully  or
      when his immigration status is precarious, the Claimant in fact  meets
      the Rules in respect of his family life, and given that in  the  light
      of the findings of Judge Colyer that the family  life  provisions  are
      met, and in light of the concession made on behalf of the Secretary of
      State, I do find that the decision taken is  disproportionate  to  the
      legitimate public end sought to be achieved. I do allow the appeal  on
      Human Rights grounds under Article 8 in respect  of  his  right  to  a
      family life with his son.  I therefore remake  the  decision  allowing
      the appeal on Human Rights grounds under Article 8.

Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Colyer  does  contain  a  material
error in that she  allowed  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   I
therefore set aside the decision to the limited extent that she allowed  the
appeal under the Immigration Rules. However, I preserve  all  of  her  other
findings of fact.

I remake the decision allowing the appeal  on  Human  Rights  grounds  under
Article 8.

In light of the circumstances of this case, which does involve a  child,  it
is appropriate for there to be an anonymity  direction.   Unless  and  until
the  Tribunal  or  Court  directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant   is   granted
anonymity.  No report of these  proceedings  shall  directly  or  indirectly
identify him or any member of his family.  This direction  applies  both  to
the Appellant and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply with this  direction
could lead to contempt of Court proceedings.

Fee Award

Judge Colyer did not make any fee award in this case,  and  that  aspect  of
the decision was not challenged by the Claimant.  I therefore  do  not  make
any fee award, notwithstanding that the Claimant has been successful.
