Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms J Bond, Counsel, Chase Legal Services
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   I shall refer to the respondent as the appellant as he was  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and  his  date  of  birth  is  7
    November 1988. He came to the UK on 7 October 2010 having been  granted
    leave to enter as a Tier 4 (General) Student on 20 September 2010.   He
    was granted further extensions of leave. The last grant  of  leave  was
    leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Student and this  expired  on  29
    September  2015.   Prior  to  the  expiry  of  his  leave  he  made  an
    application for leave to remain as the spouse of a settled person.  His
    application was refused by the Secretary of State in a decision  of  12
    August 2015.

3.    The  application  was  refused  on  suitability  grounds  because  the
    Secretary of State asserted that the appellant used a proxy to  sit  an
    English  language  test  and  as  a  consequence  he  had  submitted  a
    fraudulent TOEIC certificate with his application for leave  to  remain
    on 2 April 2012.  The application was refused under  S-LRT.1.6  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is  the  Secretary  of  State's  case  that  the
    appellant could not meet the eligibility requirement of the Immigration
    Rules.

4.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and his appeal was allowed under the Immigration Rules by Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Ripley in a decision that was promulgated on 24 May
    2016 following a hearing on 3 May 2016.  The  Secretary  of  State  was
    granted permission to appeal in a decision on 17 October 2016 by First-
    tier Tribunal Andrew.

5.   Judge Ripley heard evidence  from  the  appellant  and  his  wife,  Mrs
    Patricia [R].  In addition he heard evidence from  Mrs  [R]'s  daughter
    [T] (date of birth  23  January  2003).  Mrs  [R]  also  has  an  adult
    daughter, Tezreec.

6.   The judge made findings at paragraphs 25 to  49.  In  relation  to  the
    suitability  requirements  of  Appendix  FM  the  judge  recorded   the
    submissions that were made on behalf of the appellant and  acknowledged
    that SLT1.6 is mandatory. He considered the guidance  (general  grounds
    for refusal Section 1-version 26.0 published for Home Office  staff  on
    19 April 2016) and  he  noted  that  the  sort  of  activity  that  the
    appellant had been involved in was that covered by paragraphs  320(7B),
    320(11) and 322(2) of the Immigration Rules which was not relied on  by
    the Secretary of State.  He  also  made  reference  to  S-LTR2.2  which
    related to false documents in the application under consideration which
    was not relied on by the  Secretary  of  State.   The  judge  made  the
    following findings in relation to S-LTR.1.6;

         "31. However, in the  instant  case,  the  respondent  has  used  a
             mandatory power, on conducive grounds, to  preclude  for  past
             deception. I am not satisfied that this is a  proper  exercise
             of that power or that the  conduct  in  question  is  properly
             described as conduct that makes it undesirable to allow him to
             remain in the UK in the context of a family application.  I do
             not find that this particular incidence  of  deception  is  of
             such liability as to outweigh any applications under  Appendix
             FM, without  exception,  as  it  must  in  mandatory  refusal.
             Although the examples of conduct given in the guidance are  by
             way of examples only, I note that deception in the application
             rather than in a previous application.  That would  appear  to
             be unnecessarily narrow unless it was also intended.

         32.  The respondent has relied on the scale of  the  deception  and
             the involvement of the  test  centre.  However,  there  is  no
             evidence to suggest that the appellant was no organiser in the
             broader fraud.  The existence of a larger  more  sophisticated
             scam does not make his participation any more serious.

         33.  Mr Sartorious also placed emphasis on the appellant's  alleged
             unwillingness to divulge the details of his contact  with  the
             ETS scam.  He relied on this as evidence of the deception  and
             I do place weight on his expression of regret. I  accept  that
             the appellant could  have  been  more  forthcoming  about  his
             contact but there are numerous reasons why he  may  have  felt
             unable to do so. I do not find that this  adds  force  to  the
             argument that his past deception should automatically  exclude
             him from a successful family application under Appendix FM

         34.  I accept Miss Watterson's submission that the majority of  the
             examples given in the guidance raise much more serious conduct
             issues. This, together with the narrowing of the  examples  in
             the guidance that does refer to  deception,  and  the  absence
             and purposeful preclusion  of  provisions  dealing  with  past
             deception, leads me to conclude  that  it  was  intended  that
             deception of the type practised by  the appellant  should  not
             cause him to be  excluded   from  Appendix  FM.  Further,  and
             insofar as it is relevant or necessary, I  find  that  on  the
             facts of this case,  his  past  deception  does  not  comprise
             conduct that is not conducive to the public good because it is
             of such gravity  to make   it  undesirable  to  allow  him  to
             remain in the UK.

         35.  I  therefore  find  that  the  appellant  does  not  fall  for
             exclusion on  grounds  of  falling  to  meet  the  suitability
             provisions. However, as conceded before the appellant, he does
             not meet the  eligibility  provisions  due  to  the  technical
             omission  of  a  SELT  number  from   his   English   language
             certificate. There is no argument that he fails  to  meet  the
             eligibility or  relationship  criteria  including  E-LTRP.1.7,
             that  requires  him  to  have   a   genuine   and   subsisting
             relationship with his parents. Their cohabitation is,  in  any
             event  evidenced  by  the  correspondence   in   the   bundle.
             Additionally, I find the appellant's spouse to be a forthright
             and convincing witness. She was candid about her  reaction  to
             discovering  the  appellant  had  submitted  a  false  English
             language certificate before they were married. I accepted  her
             evidence  about  the  couple's  relationship  including  their
             family holiday. There was a  discrepancy  regarding  what  the
             appellant had told his parents of his marriage. I  accept  the
             appellant's spouse's evidence that she thought he  had.  I  do
             not know whether this is the case or whether he  is  lying  to
             his wife about  this  issue.  However,  I  do  not  find  this
             discrepancy to  be  of  such  significance  to  undermine  the
             finding that the marriage is genuine and subsisting."

7.   On the basis of the above findings, Judge Ripley concluded that  EX.1.1
    applied in the appellant's case and he went on to conclude  that  there
    were insurmountable obstacles,  namely  very  significant  difficulties
    which would be faced by the appellant and  his  partner  in  continuing
    their family life together outside the UK.

8.   The judge in concluding this took into account  the  evidence  of  [T].
    She has been doing well at school and  that  her  removal  to  Pakistan
    would significantly disrupt those studies and prejudice  her  plans  of
    studying medicine.  He noted that she was aged 13 and she and her elder
    sister have lived in the UK all of their lives.  Neither of them  speak
    Urdu or have  familiarity  with  Pakistan.   Tezreec  was  studying  at
    university and it was expected that she would return to the family home
    after graduation. The judge concluded that it would cause very  serious
    hardship to the appellant's  wife  to  require  the  family  to  uproot
    themselves and that it would entail serious hardship to require her  to
    remain here with her children without the appellant.   The  judge  that
    [T] has a poor relationship with her biological father having seen  him
    only once in recent years and he was not a realistic substitute for her
    mother.

9.   The  judge  went  on  to  consider  Article  8  outside  of  the  Rules
    concluding that the separation of  the  appellant  from  his  wife  and
    stepdaughter would result in such gravity potentially to engage Article
    8. The judge stated that although he had concluded that the appellant's
    application  should  not  have  been  refused  under  the   suitability
    requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  if  he  was  wrong  about   this   the
    interference with the appellant's and his family's  family  life  would
    not be proportionate.   The  relevant  part  of  the  decision  are  as
    follows:

         "43. However, the case law establishes that would be  a  breach  of
             his step daughter's and wife's EU rights to  require  them  to
             leave and therefore it is  not  lawful  to  propose  that  the
             appellant's family life be maintained by them leaving the  EU.
             In Sanade and others (British children -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)
             [2012] UKUT 00048 (IAC) the Tribunal held  that  Case  C-34/09
             Ruiz Zambrano [2011] EUECJ C-34/09 'now makes  it  clear  that
             where the child or indeed the remaining spouse  is  a  British
             citizen and therefore a citizen of the  European  Union  as  a
             matter of EU law, it is not possible to require the family  as
             a unit to relocate outside of the  European Union  or for  the
             Secretary of State to submit that it would be  reasonable  for
             them to do so'. In relation to a  child's  EU  rights  it  was
             further found in AQ (Nigeria) [2015] EWCA Civ  250,  that  the
             prohibition on the removal of a parent only applies  where  an
             EU national child would be compelled to leave the EU with that
             parent.  [T] could remain with her mother if her stepfather is
             required to leave. I therefore go on to  consider  whether  it
             would be proportionate that her stepfather leave alone.

         44.  In considering the issues of  public  interest  identified  in
             Section 117B, I find that the  appellant  can  speak  English.
             According to AM (S117B) Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  0206  (IAC)  the
             appellant would need to meet the English language  requirement
             of the rules in order to satisfy 117B(2). He does  so  as  his
             recent scores are in excess of A1 of the CEFT albeit that that
             certificate  has  not  been  verified.   He   is   financially
             independent, in that he is supported before his  wife  and  is
             not a burden on the tax payer. This would also satisfy 117B(3)
             pursuant to AM  (Malawi), as the respondent has  not  disputed
             that they meet the financial criteria of Appendix FM. His wife
             continues to earn in excess of �18,600 gross. Her basic salary
             is over �29,500.

         45.  The appellant was lawfully in the UK when he  established  his
             relationship with his wife, a qualifying person, as a  British
             nationality. The  respondent  has  not  taken  a  decision  to
             vitiate his leave or declare him an illegal entrant.  However,
             in AM  (Malawi)  the  Upper  Tribunal  have  stated  that  the
             precarious leave referred to in s.117B(5) would include  where
             indefinite leave is granted as a consequence of deception  and
             is  thus  revocable.  By  analogy,  I  would  find  that   the
             appellant's leave   was precarious but  not  unlawful  at  the
             time that their family life  was  established  from  September
             2012 when the ETS test was taken.  I  am  satisfied  that  the
             appellant's wife was unaware that her  husband  had  practised
             deception. By  the  time  the  respondent  made  the  decision
             challenged in this appeal, they were already married.  Neither
             she nor her daughters are responsible for the deceit that  the
             appellant practised before their marriage.

         46.  Section 117B(6) requires an assessment of whether it would  be
             reasonable to expect a  qualifying child to leave the  UK.  If
             so, it is not in the public interest  that  the  appellant  is
             removed, as  confirmed  in  Treebhawon.  The  child,  [T],  is
             British and therefore a qualifying child. As a consequence  of
             her nationality, it is neither reasonable nor lawful to expect
             her to leave.

         47.  On this question the respondent's November 2014 IDI on  family
             migration at 11.2.3  includes  a  section  on  the  background
             information of the child which has a statement  that the  Home
             Office, in  line  with   Zambrano,  will  not  expect  British
             citizen children to leave the  UK  unless  the  case  involves
             criminality. The IDI states that where a parent has repeatedly
             and deliberately breached the Immigration Rules then it may be
             the appropriate to justify the separation of the child from  a
             parent if there is another parent with whom  the  child  could
             stay with in the UK. I  am  mindful  that,  in  assessing  the
             weight to attach to the breach of the Immigration  Rules,  the
             appellant has not  been  charged  with  or  convicted  of  any
             criminal offence and I give him credit for having admitted  to
             this deception.

         48.  The appellant  is  a  step  parent  and  not  a  parent.   The
             Immigration  Rules  only  provide  for  the  appellant  to  be
             considered a parent where the child's  biological  parent  has
             died. However the same IDI on Appendix FM also confirmed  that
             a genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  may  arise
             between a child and the adult.  As  confirmed  in  R  (on  the
             application of RK) v SSHD (s117(6)) IJR UKUT 00031, the phrase
             'parental  relationship'  is  not  restricted  to   biological
             parents for the purposes of s117(6).  It  is  clear  that  [T]
             regards the appellant as her step father and her  relationship
             with him is be important to her  this  was  confirmed  by  her
             mother.  As stated above, she has a poor relationship with her
             own  father,  with  minimal  contact.  I   accept   that   the
             appellant's evidence about her relationship with  here  father
             was inconsistent. I prefer the appellant's wife's account  and
             find that the appellant had seen her father  recently  on  one
             occasion, after a gap of a number of years. However  both  the
             appellant and [T]'s evidence was that they spent time together
             after school because her mother worked long hours and  he  was
             supportive  of  her  studies  and  accompanied  her  to  extra
             coaching. I am not satisfied that the appellant's inconsistent
             evidence about [T]'s relationship with her  father  undermines
             his claims to be a committed step father and he  is  certainly
             perceived as a step father by [T]."

10.  The judge concluded that it  was  in  [T]'s  best  interests  that  she
    remains in the UK with the appellant and her  mother,  the  appellant's
    removal would  not  be  proportionate  and  there  was  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship between the appellant and [T] and as a
    result it was not reasonable to expect [T] to leave the UK.

The Grounds of Appeal and Oral Submissions

11.  The first ground of appeal  (very  much  summarised)  argues  that  the
    judge failed to give adequate reasons on a material matter,  namely  in
    relation to the decision under paragraph SS-LTR1.1 of Appendix  FM  and
    as a results of this the appeal cannot succeed with reference to EX.1.

12.  Ground 2 argues that the judge misdirected herself in law  in  relation
    to Article 8.  He did not apply  the  correct  test.   The  appellant's
    appeal failed under the Immigration Rules and it was for the  appellant
    to  demonstrate  that  there  were  exceptional   circumstances.    The
    appellant's residence had never been more than temporary and  his  wife
    was aware at the time their relationship started that  his  status  was
    uncertain.  Ground 2 argues that the Tribunal did not make any findings
    in relation to whether or not the appellant could  return  to  Pakistan
    and make an application for entry clearance (Mr Tufan expanded on  this
    point in oral submissions).

13.  Whilst the best interests of the British citizen child are  of  primary
    consideration her interests are not the primary consideration and  only
    one factor in the proportionality assessment.

14.  The Tribunal relied on the case of Treebhawon and Others (Section  117B
    (6)) [2005] UKUT 00674  but  this  was  not  the  correct  approach  in
    relation to Section 117 of the 2002 Act and the Tribunal failed to have
    regard to the public interest considerations set out in 117B.  Mr Tufan
    submitted the case of Akyarko and Ors [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  Chen, R (on
    the application of)  v  SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary
    separation - proportionality) (IJR) [2015] UKUT 189.

15.  Ms Bond relied on the skeleton argument that was before the  First-tier
    Tribunal. She had added written comments to this.  In relation  to  the
    possibility of the appellant returning to make an application for entry
    clearance this was not an issue that was raised  by  the  Secretary  of
    State in the reasons for refusal or at the hearing. It is impermissible
    to try and impugn the decision on the basis of arguments that were  not
    advanced. In relation to the decision relating to suitability the judge
    gave adequate reasons running to nine paragraphs.   The  insurmountable
    obstacles decision has not been challenged in the grounds and the judge
    addressed the public interest in accordance with Section  117B  and  Ms
    Bond referred me to paragraphs 44 and 48.

Conclusions

16.  In relation to ground 1, whilst it is essentially a reasons  challenge,
    in the main it restates the Secretary of State's case.  Insofar  as  it
    challenges the decision on the basis that it is inadequately  reasoned,
    I do not agree  with  the  Secretary  of  State.   The  judge  properly
    analysed the Immigration Rules in relation to the kind of conduct  that
    the appellant had been involved in. The conduct that the appellant  was
    involved in would be conduct which could engage 320(7B)  (d),  but  for
    the automatic prohibition on the grant of leave to remain (applications
    for entry clearance or leave to enter) as a family member is disapplied
    in this case and could not be invoked by the Secretary of  State.  (The
    judge was wrong to state that this paragraph applies to entry clearance
    and leave to enter.  It also  applies  to  applications  for  leave  to
    remain (see A320), but nothing turns on this).   Paragraph  320(11),  a
    discretionary ground of refusal did not apply  in  this  case  for  the
    reasons properly identified by the judge.

17.  S-LTR.1.6. reads as follows:

         "The presence of the applicant in the UK is not  conducive  to  the
         public good because their conduct (including convictions  which  do
         not   fall   within   paragraphs    S-LTR.1.3.21.5.),    character,
         associations, or other reasons, make it undesirable to  allow  them
         to remain in the UK."

18.  The judge concluded that the paragraph did not apply to  the  appellant
    in this case and  that  the  conduct  contemplated  in  S-LTR.1.6.  was
    conduct of a more serious nature and  he  concluded  that  it  was  not
    established that the presence of  the  applicant  in  the  UK  was  not
    conducive to the public good.

19.  In reaching this conclusion he took account of the guidance  and  there
    is no suggestion in the grounds of appeal that the judge  misunderstood
    or misapplied this.  He concluded that S-LTR.1.6. was intended for more
    serious conduct than that which the appellant  was  involved  in.   The
    judge concluded that there was no evidence that the  appellant  was  in
    any way involved in the broader fraud involving ETS and that  the  fact
    that it was a sophisticated  and  widespread  scam  did  not  make  the
    appellant's conduct any more serious.  He took into  account  that  the
    appellant made admissions and expressed regret. None of these  findings
    are challenged.  Engaging with the ground of appeal,  I  conclude  that
    the  decision  of  the  judge  is  adequately  reasoned.  The  ultimate
    conclusion reached is not irrational or perverse (this was  not  argued
    in the grounds or by Mr Tufan in oral submissions).  The findings  were
    open to the judge on the evidence before him.

20.  The first ground of appeal argues that because the appellant could  not
    meet the suitability requirements paragraph EX.1. does not apply to his
    case.  However, as I have concluded that the  decision  on  suitability
    grounds was lawful and sustainable, the latter argument does not  bite.
    EX.1. applied. Significantly, there is  no  challenge  to  the  judge's
    decision under EX.1 that the appellant had established that  there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life  continuing  with  his  partner
    outside of the UK.   The  unchallenged  findings  and  reasons  are  at
    paragraph 37. I observe that considering the unchallenged  findings  of
    the judge in relation to the appellant  and  his  stepdaughter,  namely
    that he has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship with her and
    that she is a British citizen, the judge could have allowed the  appeal
    under EX.1(a)(ii).

21.  It follows therefore that the  decision  of  the  judge  to  allow  the
    appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  is  lawful  and  sustainable  and
    therefore the second ground  of  appeal  which  relates  to  the  wider
    Article 8 assessment is not material.
