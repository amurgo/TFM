                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

    1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's application  for  asylum  and
       ancillary protection on 1 May 2016. Her appeal against that decision
       was dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Farmer  following  a
       hearing on 12  September  2016.  This  is  an  appeal  against  that
       decision.


    2. Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 (SI 2008/269) I make  an  anonymity  order.  Unless  the  Upper
       Tribunal  or  a  Court  directs  otherwise,  no  report   of   these
       proceedings or any form of publication  thereof  shall  directly  or
       indirectly identify the Appellant or any of her family members. This
       direction applies to, amongst others, all parties.  Any  failure  to
       comply with this direction could give  rise  to  contempt  of  court
       proceedings. I do so in order  to  preserve  the  anonymity  of  the
       Appellant's child (who I will refer to as L) who is now  3  �  years
       old.

The grant of permission


    3. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Roberts granted permission to appeal  (6
       December 2016) on the grounds that it is arguable that;


   1) the Judge did not give adequate  consideration  to  the  viability  of
      internal relocation,
   2) the finding that her mother could  give  protection  was  against  the
      weight of the evidence, and
   3) the judgement fails to  take  into  account  the  guidance  on  single
      mothers with illegitimate children set out in TD  and  AD  (Trafficked
      Women) [2016] UKUT 00092.


Respondent's position

    4. It was submitted in the rule 24 notice (6 January 2017) that;


   1) the Judge made findings open to  him  on  internal  relocation  having
      assessed the availability of funds, the assistance she would  receive,
      her own resourcefulness, and the inability of  her  husband  to  trace
      her,
   2) the Judge made findings open to him that her family were  not  violent
      towards her in the past and would not be violent on her return,
   3) the Judge made findings open to him that having support  in  the  past
      and given the aforementioned lack of risk, her mother would be able to
      assist her on her return, and
   4) the Appellant is not a trafficked woman and accordingly  the  guidance
      in relation to that is not applicable.


   5. It was submitted orally that whilst a different Judge may have reached
      a different conclusion, that is  not  the  test.  There  has  been  no
      challenge within the grounds to the asylum dismissal.  The  Judge  was
      aware she was pregnant and referred to it  on  numerous  occasions  at
      [11], [15], [36 (c)], [40], [51], and  [54].  The  Appellant  is  from
      Vlore which is in the south east of Albania and not the north east.


Appellant's position

    6. The Judge has not taken into account that the Appellant is  pregnant
       or had that or returning with an illegitimate child considered as  a
       specific risk factor. AM and BM (Trafficked women) Albania CG [2010]
       UKUT 00080 does  not  just  relate  to  victims  of  trafficking  as
       explained in [154] and [157]. TD is also relevant [111]. She  cannot
       live with her mother if she would be shunned by the males her mother
       lives with. She is cut off from the male members of her  family  and
       can only be supported in secret so how can she live with her.

The Judges findings

    7. The Judge noted the concession [13] that  being  frightened  of  her
       violent husband and family does not constitute a social group within
       the meaning of Shah and Islam v SSHD [1999] INLR 144.


       Following her action of living with and then marrying a man  of  her
       choice without her family's consents, she was shunned by the  family
       but they were not violent to her and did not threaten  her.  Without
       something more, she cannot rely on her fear  that  her  family  will
       carry out an honour killing or act violently towards her. It is more
       likely that they will continue to shun her which  is  the  way  they
       behaved for several years prior to her departure [15].

       Her mother was able to  assist  in  secret,  provide  food  for  her
       without her husband or her brothers finding out,  and  was  able  to
       provide E4,000 which is a significant sum of money  at  quite  short
       notice in order to secure her departure  from  Albania.  Her  mother
       will continue to support her if she returns to Albania and has shown
       herself to be resourceful and supportive. Her  mother  was  able  to
       work and this shows independence [16].


       Her mother did not suspect she was being  abused.  Despite  visiting
       regularly, she did not, for  example,  notice  bruising  on  her  or
       suspect she was the victim of violence. The Appellant did not report
       the violence to the police. The marriage was not  a  happy  one  and
       there may have been an element of abuse within the marriage, but  it
       is not to the extent that her husband would be likely  to  kill  her
       [21].


       Her husband will not be aware of her return to Albania. She can live
       with her mother who would be a  protective  influence.  Her  husband
       would not be able to find out if she registered with the authorities
       as he  had  no  contact  with  them  or  means  of  accessing  their
       information. It is only speculation that a relative would  spot  her
       in the street [22].


       She has been cut off from the male members of her family but has the
       continued emotional and financial support of her mother. She  speaks
       Albanian and has lived there  most  of  her  life.  She  has  strong
       cultural and social ties which will assist her. She can  also  apply
       for a financial returns package  attached  to  voluntary  departures
       from the UK. She has shown herself to be resourceful. She  travelled
       through Europe with a young child. She has  established  herself  in
       the short time here by registering L with a doctor  and  in  nursery
       school. She would be capable of adjusting to  life  in  a  different
       city away from her husband in Vlore  if  she  chose  to.  Relocation
       would not be unduly harsh [23].


       She has a support network in Albania. Her mother provided her and  L
       with food. She would contact her by phone and visit her.  She  could
       live with her mother. It is not credible her brothers would be  able
       to prevent her having an education and working. With the support  of
       her mother she would be able to find employment or be  supported  by
       her mother's employment [37].


       There is no suggestion antenatal care is not  available  in  Albania
       [40].


       L is 3 � years old. She is pregnant but does not know the father  or
       have the means of identifying him. L has not built up a  significant
       peer group relationship, has been here for a  year,  and  spent  the
       majority of his life in Albania. His primary attachment  is  to  his
       mother. He will have a secondary attachment to his  grandmother.  He
       is young and adaptable and could very easily adapt to  returning  to
       Albania [51]. It is in his best interest to remain with  his  mother
       [54]. They could return to live with  her  family  or  relocate  and
       would not be at risk [55].

Guidance Case Law

    8. TD notes [111];


           "...women living on their own are  immediately  identifiable  as
           being on the 'outside'; even if the details of their history are
           not known, work colleagues and neighbours  may  view  them  with
           some suspicion. In some cases that suspicion  will  escalate  to
           open prejudice and hostility. We therefore  find  no  reason  to
           depart from the general conclusions on this matter drawn by  the
           Tribunal in AM & BM. Women living on their own are likely to  be
           socially distinct. Whilst discrimination  and  stigma  certainly
           exist they will not generally  constitute  persecutory  "serious
           harm" or breach Article 3, but this it nevertheless a factor  to
           be  considered  cumulatively  when  assessing  whether  internal
           flight is reasonable for any given appellant."


    9. AM notes that [154];


           "...if a victim of trafficking has a child there would be  cases
           where a family would not accept the child back as it would be  a
           visible reminder of the fact that their daughter or  sister  was
           "unclean".  In extreme cases children can be abandoned. There is
           evidence that in the past honour killings have taken place  when
           a daughter or sister  is  considered  to  have  dishonoured  the
           family by her conduct even though she was the  victim  of  rape.
           However, the evidence indicates that such "honour" killings  are
           now very rare indeed."


           And [157]


           "...it would be difficult for any woman without  family  backing
           to get a job, that the agencies would be likely to  ensure  that
           jobs went to family members  and  that  societal  discrimination
           would mean that anyone who is thought of as ""kurva""  would  be
           shunned and have difficulties in integrating at work.   Moreover
           men in workplaces would be likely to harass any  woman  who  did
           not have family protection and this would be  exacerbated  in  a
           situation where it was  known  that  the  woman  had  come  from
           abroad.   She  indicated  that  the  shelters  were   themselves
           insecure and that men,  knowing  that  they  housed  victims  of
           trafficking, would be likely to prowl around the centres looking
           for women."

Discussion

   10. I am not satisfied that the Judge materially erred for the following
       reasons.


   11. The Judge was fully aware that the Appellant was currently  pregnant
       having referred to it on 6 occasions  and  plainly  took  that  into
       account. It was a specific risk  factor  that  was  plainly  at  the
       forefront of his mind.


   12. He also was plainly aware and took into account that  the  Appellant
       had an illegitimate child, as he  repeatedly  referred  to  that  as
       being the root of the family problems she had.  It  was  a  specific
       risk factor that was plainly at the forefront of his mind.


   13. The Appellant was not a victim  of  trafficking  and  would  not  be
       required or even eligible to live in a hostel for such victims.


   14. Just because her male family members may shun her as they did in the
       past, that does not equate to not accepting  L  back  and  does  not
       equate to open prejudice or hostility.


   15. She would not necessarily be living on her own as  even  though  she
       may be shunned by the male members of the family, that does not mean
       that she could  not  live  with  her  mother.  Living  in  a  frosty
       atmosphere is not the same as living in a dangerous  situation.  The
       Judge in that respect did not make contradictory findings.


   16. Internal relocation was not therefore required,  but  the  Appellant
       could move with the support of her mother if she wished, which would
       negate the probes  identified  for  women  with  no  family  backing
       referred to in AM [157].  Given  the  completely  different  factual
       matrix to those in AM and TD, their relevance to this case was  very
       limited. The fact she may be treated with suspicion does not  equate
       to a real risk factor as explained in TD [111].


   17. In summary the Judge was entitled to  determine  the  facts  in  the
       appeal as he did, and the arguments  in  support  of  the  Appellant
       amount to nothing more than a disagreement with those findings.



Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

      I do not set aside the decision.
