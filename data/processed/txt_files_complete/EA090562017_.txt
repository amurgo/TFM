                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS


     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge Wyman promulgated on the 16 August 2018 in which the
        Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal against the refusal  of  the
        respondent to issue him a Residence Card as confirmation of a right
        to reside in the United Kingdom as the stepson of an  EEA  national
        exercising treaty rights in the UK.



Background


     2. The appellant, a citizen of Pakistan born on 3 June  1988,  entered
        the United Kingdom lawfully  with  leave  as  a  Tier  4  (General)
        Student granted on 4 September  2013.  The  appellant's  leave  was
        curtailed but he was subsequently granted leave to  remain  in  the
        same capacity until 23 June 2017. On that date the appellant sought
        a Residence Card as the dependent family member of an EEA national,
        an application refused by the Secretary  of  State  on  1  November
        2017.
     3. The EEA national is a Ms [B],  a  Belgian  national  who  has  been
        employed since 2010 as a Market Development Representative  in  the
        UK. The appellant's father Mr  [AJ]  married  the  sponsor  in  the
        United Kingdom on 14 April 1998, but he died on 16 July  2006.  The
        appellant claims to be solely dependent upon his sponsor since  she
        and his father married.
     4. The Secretary of  State's  case  is  that  the  appellant  had  not
        provided adequate evidence to prove he is a dependent direct family
        member of an EEA  national.  It  was  accepted  the  appellant  had
        provided sufficient evidence show he is living with his EEA sponsor
        but claimed he had not provided  evidence  of  money  transfers  or
        other evidence to show he is currently reliant  on  his  stepmother
        beyond residing in the same household.
     5. The Judge sets out findings of fact from [48] of the decision under
        challenge which can be summarised as follows:


               a.  The  respondent  accepts  the  appellant   has   provided
                  sufficient evidence to show he was  living  with  his  EEA
                  sponsor but claims he had not provided further evidence to
                  show current reliance on his stepmother beyond residing in
                  the same household [49].
               b. Before coming to the United Kingdom  the  appellant  lived
                  with his mother and siblings in Pakistan [50].
               c. The EEA national sponsor owned  the  house  in  which  the
                  appellant lived in Pakistan since 1996 until his departure
                  from the United Kingdom  in  2013.  The  Judge  finds  the
                  appellant  was  dependent  upon  the   EEA   sponsor   for
                  accommodation during this period [51].
               d. There is more limited evidence of sponsorship from the EEA
                  national to the appellant during the  years  he  lived  in
                  Pakistan,  it  being  acknowledged  there  were  no  money
                  transfers  slips  or  bank   statement   showing   regular
                  deposits; the explanation being that when people travel to
                  Pakistan they will bring cash but there was no evidence to
                  confirm this [52].
               e. In the appellant's interview on 4 September 2013 he stated
                  he was working as a Senior  Telesales  Representative  and
                  claims to have no family in the United Kingdom [53].
               f. The appellant has explained that  he  thought  this  meant
                  blood relations of which the  EEA  national  is  not.  The
                  Judge thought  the  appellant  could  have  added  further
                  information stating he had  a  stepmother  in  the  United
                  Kingdom [54].
               g. The Judge was satisfied  the  appellant  would  have  been
                  dependent upon the EEA national when he  was  a  minor  or
                  shortly after the death of his father, but it could not be
                  found he was dependent on the EEA  national  for  support,
                  with the exception of accommodation, for all the  time  he
                  was in Pakistan [55].
               h. Since the appellant arrived  in  the  United  Kingdom  the
                  Judge  accepts  the  EEA  national  paid  the  appellant's
                  university fees although he was also receiving money  from
                  some other friends as evidenced from bank statements [56].
               i. The  Judge  accepts  the  appellant  has  been  living  in
                  accommodation provided by the EEA national since  he  came
                  to the UK [57].
               j. In 2018 there have been no regular transfers of funds from
                  the EEA national the appellant's  account  for  which  was
                  explained by the fact the EEA national used  to  give  the
                  appellant cash in hand [58].
               k. The appellant has completed  his  degree  studies  in  the
                  United Kingdom but has made no attempt to find employment.
                  The appellant indicates he wishes to study for an MBA, but
                  no evidence was provided  of  any  courses  considered  or
                  applications made. It was found to be unclear as to why he
                  needed an MBA for any future work or employment given  his
                  total lack of employment history  in  the  United  Kingdom
                  [59].
               l. The appellant is 30 years old, not a minor or  child.   In
                  many households' young adults would have  completed  their
                  education many years ago and been  in  regular  employment
                  [60].
               m. At [61] the Judge finds "I therefore find that  dependency
                  is not genuine but fabricated. The appellant is  an  able-
                  bodied man who is well able to work and does not  need  to
                  rely on his stepmother for support. He came to the  United
                  Kingdom to complete his degree which she  is  successfully
                  done."
               n. The Judge finds the appellant is in a  position  where  he
                  can support himself,  he  speaks  fluent  English,  has  a
                  degree  but  has  chosen  not  to  obtain  relevant   work
                  experience.  It  is  found  the  appellant  could  support
                  himself to meet his basic needs.


     6. The  appellant  sought  permission  to  appeal  arguing  the  Judge
        misapplied the ratio of cases relied upon in the decision  for  the
        reasons stated in the grounds. Permission to appeal was granted  by
        another judge of the First-Tier Tribunal on 12  October  2018;  the
        operative part of the grant being in the following terms:

             "3.  The ground appears to be arguable. Despite setting out  a
                  number of relevant legal authorities, the  Judge  arguably
                  misdirected herself. At [59] - [62], she  found  that  the
                  claimed dependency was fabricated  because  the  Appellant
                  "is an able-bodied man who is well able  to  work..."  She
                  had earlier opined that in "many households, young  adults
                  would have completed their education many  years  ago  and
                  been in regular employment." This suggested that the Judge
                  had had regard to irrelevant  factors  (namely,  the  fact
                  that the Appellant could obtain work but have  chosen  not
                  to do so) and not applied the correct  test  (whether  the
                  Appellant required the material support of his  stepmother
                  in order to meet his essential needs, per SM (India) v ECO
                  [2009] EWCA Civ  1426  approving  Centre  Publique  d'Aide
                  Social de Courcelles v  Lebon  [1987]  ECR  2811  and  Jia
                  Migrationsverket Case C-1/05)."


Error of law



        Regulation 7 of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations 2016 sets out the
        definition of a "Family member":


             "(1) In these Regulations, "family member" means, in  relation
             to a person ("A") - (a) A's spouse or civil partner;  (b)  A's
             direct descendants or the direct descendants of A's spouse  or
             civil partner who are - (i) under 21; or  (ii)  dependants  of
             A's,  A's  spouse  or  civil  partner;  (c)  dependent  direct
             relatives in A's ascending line or in that of  A's  spouse  or
             civil partner; (2)  where A  is  a  student  residing  in  the
             United Kingdom otherwise than  under  regulation  13  (initial
             right of residence) a person is not a family member of A under
             paragraph (1)(b) or (c) unless - (a) in the case of  paragraph
             (1)(b),the person is the dependent child of A or of A's spouse
             or civil partner; or (b) A also falls within one of the  other
             categories of qualified person mentioned in regulation 6  (1).
             (3) A person ("B) who is an extended  family  member  and  has
             been  issued  with  an  EEA  family  permit,  a   registration
             certificate or a residence card must be treated  as  a  family
             member of  A  provided  -  (a)  B  continues  to  satisfy  the
             conditions in regulation 8(2),(3)(4) or (5); and (b)  the  EEA
             family permit,  registration  certificate  or  residence  card
             remains in force.  (4)  A  must  be  an  EEA  national  unless
             regulation 9 applies (family members of British citizens)."

     7. It is not disputed the relevant category is regulation  7(1)(b)(ii)
        as the dependent of the EEA national.
     8. In Jia Migrationsverket Case C -1/05 the European Court  considered
        "dependence" under Article 1(1)(d) of Directive 73/148/EEC and said
        this was to be interpreted to the effect that "dependent  on  them"
        meant that members of the family of an EU national  established  in
        another member state within the meaning of Article  43  of  the  EC
        Treaty, needed the material support of that EU national, or his  or
        her spouse, in order to meet their essential needs in the state  of
        origin of those family members or the state  from  which  they  had
        come at the time when they applied to join  the  EU  national.  The
        Court said that Article 6(b) of the Directive was to be interpreted
        as meaning that proof of the need for  material  support  might  be
        adduced by any appropriate means, while a mere undertaking  by  the
        EU national or his or her spouse  to  support  the  family  members
        concerned need not be regarded as establishing the existence of the
        family member's situation of real dependence.
     9. In Bigia & Others [2009] EWCA Civ 79 at paragraph 24 Maurice Kay LJ
        said that where the  question  of  whether  someone  is  a  "family
        member" depends on a test  of  dependency,  that  test  is  as  per
        paragraph 43 of the ECJ's judgement in Jia.  In essence members  of
        the family of a Union citizen needed the material support  of  that
        Union citizen or his or her spouse in order to meet their essential
        needs.
    10. In Moneke (EEA - OFMs) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00341(IAC) (Blake J)  at
        para 41 the Tribunal accepted that the definition of dependency was
        accurately captured by the current UKBA ECIs which read as  follows
        at ch.5.12: "In determining if a family member or  extended  family
        member is dependent (i.e. financially dependent)  on  the  relevant
        EEA national for the purposes of  the  EEA  Regulations:  Financial
        dependency should be interpreted as meaning that the  person  needs
        financial support from the EEA national or  his/  her  spouse/civil
        partner in order to meet his/her essential needs - not in order  to
        have a certain level of income. Provided a person would not be able
        to meet  his/her  essential  living  needs  without  the  financial
        support of the EEA national, s/he should be considered dependent on
        that national. In those circumstances, it does not matter that  the
        applicant may in addition receive financial support /  income  from
        other sources. There is  no  need  to  determine  the  reasons  for
        recourse to the financial support provided by the EEA  national  or
        to consider whether the applicant is able to support him/herself by
        taking up paid employment. The person does not need to be living or
        have lived in an EEA state which  the  EEA  national  sponsor  also
        lives or has lived." At paragraph 42 the Tribunal went  on  "We  of
        course accept (and as the ECIs reflect) that  dependency  does  not
        have to be "necessary" in the sense of the Immigration Rules,  that
        is to say an able  bodied  person  who  chooses  to  rely  for  his
        essential needs on material support of the sponsor may be  entitled
        to do so even if he could meet those needs from his or her economic
        activity.
    11. The Judge refers to ECO Manilla v Lim [2015] EWCA Civ 1383 in which
        an appellant sought entry, as the family member of an EU  national.
        The appellant had savings  and  a  retirement  fund  in  excess  of
        �55,000 and she owned her own home in Malaysia valued  at  �80,000.
        The appellant's daughter, married to the EU national, sent her �450
        per quarter which she used to meet her  expenses  without  spending
        any capital. Applying Reyes v Migrationsverket (Case C- 423/12)  it
        was held that it was not enough to show that the financial  support
        was in fact provided by the EU citizen  to  a  family  member;  the
        family member must need that support in order  to  meet  her  basic
        needs; there needed  to  exist  a  situation  of  real  dependence;
        receipt of support was a necessary condition of dependency, but not
        a sufficient condition; and it was necessary to determine that  the
        family member was dependent in  the  sense  of  being  in  need  of
        assistance even though it was irrelevant why she was dependent. If,
        as here, the family member could  support  herself,  there  was  no
        dependency even though she was given financial support from the  EU
        citizen.
    12. The issue raised by the appellant in the  grounds  is  the  Judge's
        treatment of what has been found to be a dependency of  choice.  In
        Lim the claimant, who had sufficient savings to meet her own  needs
        but chose instead to rely on financial support from  a  related  EU
        citizen, could not be regarded as being dependent on  her  relative
        and was not therefore a family member within the meaning of Article
        2.2  of  Directive  2004/38/EC  ("the  Citizens  Directive").   The
        jurisprudence has expressly approved dependency of  choice  in  the
        form of choosing not to take  up  employment  see  Centre  Publique
        d'Aide Social de Courcelles v Lebon [1987] ECR  2811  ("Lebon")  at
        [22].
    13. In Maria Pedro v SSWP [2009] EWCA Civ  1358  the  Court  of  Appeal
        confirmed that dependency could be of choice and did not have to be
        of necessity.
    14. In SM(India) v ECO and OQ and NQ (India) v ECO [2009] EWCA Civ 1426
        the Tribunal was not satisfied that the claimants were dependent on
        their sponsor as there was no evidence that they could  not  obtain
        work and no evidence that they had made enquiries about  employment
        in India.   The Court of Appeal said that the  test  on  dependency
        was to be found in Lebon (Case 316.850 as read with  Jia  (case  C-
        1/05) and in so far as the decision in AP and  FP  (India)  decided
        that the latter  had  effectively  overruled  the  former,  it  was
        wrongly decided and should not be followed.  There was  nothing  in
        the decision in Jia to suggest that any doubt had been cast on  the
        proposition that there was no need "to raise the  question  whether
        the person concerned was able to support himself by taking up  paid
        employment".  The fact that the claimants had not obtained work  or
        even tried to obtain  work  in  India  was  not  relevant  for  the
        purposes of  the  Directive.  The  test  is  whether  an  applicant
        requires the 'material' support of the EU citizen in order to  meet
        his 'essential' needs.  The question of whether  he  could  support
        himself rather than  by  having  to  rely  on  the  EU  citizen  is
        irrelevant.
    15. The finding of the Judge at [61] that the dependency is not genuine
        but fabricated is a finding that dependency has  been  established.
        Mr Linsday argued that the appellant was not truly dependent as  he
        had worked in Pakistan  and  his  own  evidence  was  that  he  had
        received substantial sums from other sources  in  addition  to  the
        help provided by the EEA national sponsor in the past. Whilst  this
        may be historically correct and whilst the appellant may be able to
        secure employment with the qualifications  he  has  obtained,  this
        submission challenges the motive which is not relevant unless it is
        a case in which there is evidence of an abuse of treaty rights.  It
        was not suggested however that the finding by the  Judge  that  the
        dependency 'was not genuine but fabricated' was an  assertion  that
        there was a breach of treaty rights and there  is  no  evidence  to
        support any such submission.
    16. I find this is a case in which the Judge has  erred  in  law  in  a
        manner material to the decision to dismiss the appeal.  Whilst  the
        Judge may have adopted what she  saw  as  a  common-sense  approach
        which is  theoretically  plausible,  the  question  the  Judge  was
        required to ask was whether the  appellant  required  the  material
        support of the EEA national in order to meet his  essential  needs.
        It was clearly made out on the facts before the First-Tier Tribunal
        that this test had been satisfied. It  may  have  appeared  to  the
        Judge to be a dependency of choice but that is arguably  irrelevant
        in light of the case law and absence of any suggestion of a  breach
        or abuse of community law.
    17. I set the decision of the Judge aside.
    18. I proceed to remake the decision by  allowing  the  appeal  on  the
        basis the  evidence  supported  the  finding  the  appellant  is  a
        dependent family  member  of  the  EEA  sponsor  who  requires  the
        financial assistance provided to enable him to meet  his  essential
        needs.


Decision

    19. The First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred in law. I set  aside
        the decision of the  original  Judge.  I  remake  the  decision  as
