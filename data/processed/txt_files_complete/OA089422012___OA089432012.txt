Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr A Hersi of Hersi & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The first appellant is a citizen of Somalia who was born  on  21  June
      1978. The second appellant is her son who was born on 1 March 2000 and
      is also a citizen of  Somalia.   On  23  March  2012,  the  appellants
      applied for entry  clearance  to  join  the  sponsor,  Mr  Ali  Mahmud
      Mohamed, a British citizen in the UK.  The first appellant is his wife
      and the second appellant is his stepson.  On 5 April 2012,  the  Entry
      Clearance  Officer  at  Nairobi  refused  each  of   the   appellant's
      applications  under  paragraphs  281  and  291  respectively  of   the
      Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended).  The appellants appealed to the
      First-tier Tribunal.  In a determination promulgated  on  19  February
      2013, Judge Woolley dismissed each of the  appellants'  appeals.   The
      Judge accepted that the  first  appellant  and  sponsor  were  validly
      married.  However, the Judge found that the first appellant could  not
      meet the English language requirement in  para  281(i).   Further,  in
      respect  of  each  appellant  the  Judge  found  that,  although   the
      accommodation requirement  of  the  Rules  was  met,  the  maintenance
      requirements in respectively para 281(v)  and  297(v)  were  not  met.
      Further, the Judge found that the respondent's decision to refuse each
      of the appellants entry clearance did not breach Article 8.

   2. The appellants sought permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal
      against the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeals
      under Article 8.  The Judge's decision in respect of  the  Immigration
      Rules was not challenged.  On 14 May  2013,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      granted each of  the  appellants  permission  to  appeal.   Thus,  the
      appeals came before me.

The Background

   3. The background facts to  the  appeals  maybe  summarised  as  follows.
      The sponsor married his first wife in 1985 and had two  children.   In
      1999 he came to the UK and was recognised as a refugee and  is  now  a
      British citizen. His first wife and  children  went  to  Ethiopia  and
      their applications to join him  were  refused  and  they  returned  to
      Somalia.  His first wife was killed in 2008 during  a  grenade  attack
      and his son was also killed in another attack.  His  daughter  is  now
      married and living in the Yemen but he has no contact with her.

   4. In April 2011, the sponsor went to Ethiopia  for  a  holiday.   During
      that holiday he met the appellant at a family member's house.   Before
      returning to the UK, the appellant and sponsor agreed to  marry.   The
      Judge accepted that the first appellant's husband had been  killed  in
      Somalia in 2007 and, on the basis of DNA evidence, also accepted  that
      the second appellant is her son.  At the date of  the  ECO's  decision
      the second appellant was 12 years of age.  The evidence was  that  the
      sponsor kept in touch with his wife after his return to  the  UK.   He
      went back to Ethiopia  on  19  January  2012  and  he  and  the  first
      appellant were married on 24 February 2012.

   5. The sponsor is a self-employed minicab driver earning, after expenses,
      about �14,900 per year.  He lives in a two bedroomed flat for which he
      pays �700 rent per month. He sends the first appellant $200 per  month
      and more if necessary.  The evidence before the  Judge  was  that  the
      first appellant is entirely dependent on the sponsor financially.  She
      lives with the second appellant outside Addis Ababa.

The Judge's Decision

   6. The Judge dealt with the appellants' claims under Article 8  at  paras
      36-46 of her determination as follows:

           "36.  The only question here is article 8.  As this is an  entry
                 clearance  case  the  question  is  not  so  much  one   of
                 interference but whether the respondent is in breach of her
                 positive obligation to respect family life.   The  standard
                 of proof is the balance of  probability  and  I  take  into
                 account the situation at the date of decision  (Shamin  Box
                 [2002] UKAIT 02212 as confirmed  in  SS  v  ECO  (Malaysia)
                 [2004] UKAIT 91).

             37. In A (Afghanistan) [2009] EWCA Civ 825 the Court of  Appeal
                 acknowledged that the 5 stage approach set  out  in  Razgar
                 [2004] UKHL 27 should still be followed in entry  clearance
                 cases.  Each case depends upon its own facts and is  highly
                 case sensitive.

             38. In Huang [2007] UKHL 11 the House of Lords held that  where
                 the question of proportionality  is  reached  the  ultimate
                 question for the Tribunal is whether the refusal  of  leave
                 to enter or remain, in circumstances where the life of  the
                 family  cannot  reasonably  be  expected  to   be   enjoyed
                 elsewhere, taking full account of  all  the  considerations
                 weighing in favour of refusal, prejudices the  family  life
                 of the appellant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount
                 to a breach of the fundamental right protected  by  Article
                 8.

             39. The legitimate aim being pursued here is the maintenance of
                 the  economic  interests  of  the  UK   through   effective
                 immigration control.

             40. Article 8 is not an opportunity to re-write the immigration
                 rules, although since Huang it  has  been  recognised  that
                 they are not necessarily human rights compliant.

             41. The sponsor is now a British citizen.   I  accept  that  it
                 would be unreasonable to expect him to go to Ethiopia where
                 he is not a citizen and there is no evidence  he  would  be
                 allowed to stay there.  It is probably also unreasonable to
                 expect the whole family to return to Somalia.  Although the
                 situation is improving there and Mogadishu is being held up
                 as an  example,  the  sponsor  has  been  recognised  as  a
                 refugee.

             42. I have accepted that this is a genuine marriage.  I  accept
                 there is some family life with  which  the  decision  could
                 potentially amount to such  interference  as  to  potential
                 engage article 8.  I have therefore considered the question
                 of proportionality.

             43. Parties cannot necessarily choose where to carry on married
                 life; the parties must have been aware of  this  when  they
                 married.  Family life has never been carried on in the  UK.
                 The marriage is of  short  duration  and  they  have  spent
                 little time together although I accept they  have  kept  in
                 touch.  The 2nd appellant is not the sponsor's son and they
                 have not spent a great deal of time together.

             44. As far as the 2nd appellant is concerned, it is established
                 that s 55 of the  Borders  Act  does  not  apply  to  entry
                 clearance cases unless the ECO has grave concerns  for  the
                 safety of the child in which  case  they  are  required  to
                 apply the principles of that  legislation.   (See  T  (s.55
                 BCIA 2009) (entry clearance) Jamaica [2011]  00483  (2011).
                 This is not the situation in this case.  The 2nd  appellant
                 does not have the right to be educated in  the  UK  as  the
                 sponsor implies.

             45. This is not  necessarily  the  end  of  the  road  for  the
                 appellants.  The appellant can arrange to take  an  English
                 language course and the sponsor may be able to increase his
                 earnings; he is obviously well  respected  as  a  mini  cab
                 driver.

             46. I  find  that  the  decision  does  not  disproportionately
                 interfere with the article 8 rights of  the  appellants  or
                 the sponsor."

   7. As those paragraphs make clear, the Judge accepted  that  the  sponsor
      could not be reasonably expected to live with his wife and stepson  in
      Ethiopia and further that as a family they could not  be  expected  to
      live in Somalia.   Nevertheless, the Judge found that, even given  the
      inevitable separation, the interference with their family life was not
      disproportionate.  The Judge noted at  para  45  that  the  appellants
      could make future applications if the  first  appellant  undertook  an
      English language course and if the sponsor increased his earnings.

The Appellants' Submissions

   8. On behalf of the appellants, Mr Hersi made  a  number  of  submissions
      arguing that the Judge had erred in law.  First, he submitted that the
      Judge had applied the wrong standard of proof, namely the  balance  of
      probabilities, when the  correct  standard  of  proof  in  determining
      Article 8 was that of "real risk".  Secondly, he  submitted  that  the
      Judge had failed  to  give  adequate  reasons  for  finding  that  the
      respondent's decisions were proportionate.  Thirdly, he submitted that
      the Judge had failed to take into account adequately  or  at  all  the
      "best interests" of the second appellant.

Discussion and Analysis

   9. First, I deal with the issue of the standard of proof.   In  paragraph
      36 of her determination, the Judge stated that the standard  of  proof
      was that of a "balance of probabilities".   Mr  Hersi  submitted  that
      that was inconsistent with a passage in the judgement of  Lord  Wilson
      in the Supreme Court decision of R (Quila) v SSHD [2011]  UKSC  45  at
      [44].  Mr Hersi also referred me to a grant of permission to appeal by
      the Court of Appeal in a case Abdul Abdi Noor Ibrahim v SSHD dated  23
      October 2012 which raised the question of the standard of proof  under
      Article  8.   Mr  Hersi  provided  a  copy  of  the  Upper  Tribunal's
      determination in that case which was subject to appeal where the Upper
      Tribunal (C M G Ockelton, Vice President and UTJ Hanson) had concluded
      that the civil standard of proof, namely a balance  of  probabilities,
      applied in Article 8 appeals where "no protection issues" arose.

  10. I do not accept Mr Hersi's submissions.   Mr  Hersi  readily  accepted
      that the Upper Tribunal's decision in  Ibrahim  was  contrary  to  his
      submissions.  That is undoubtedly correct.  The Upper Tribunal set out
      the position at paras 23-27 of its determination as follows:

           "23.  We do accept that in  cases  where  there  are  protection
                 issues and in which the Tribunal may be considering asylum,
                 humanitarian protection and Article 3 issues,  in  addition
                 to Article 8, that the lower standard  is  applicable.   It
                 would not be practicable to  have  differing  standards  of
                 proof in such cases.

             24. In a protection case the Tribunal is also looking  at  what
                 might happen in the future and  so  the  same  standard  is
                 applied to common facts.  The use of the  term  'might'  in
                 relation to the issues before the Tribunal in a  protection
                 case also illustrates the need for a different approach  to
                 cases with no protection element.   The  majority  of  such
                 cases in which the protection issue arises will be  appeals
                 from within the United Kingdom where  the  consequences  of
                 the decision will be the appellant's removal and  in  which
                 the impact of the same upon the rights  of  the  individual
                 appellant are being considered.

             25. An appeal under the Rules or involving Article  8  with  no
                 protection issues  requires  the  Tribunal  to  consider  a
                 different question, namely whether, on known  facts,  there
                 will be a breach of an individual's rights or it  has  been
                 shown that the criteria of the rules are satisfied.  It  is
                 this fundamental difference between the past and the future
                 basis on which the relevant issues have  to  be  considered
                 which  is  why  differing  standards  are   required   when
                 considering protection and non-protection cases.

             26. It is also impractical for a Tribunal  to  be  required  to
                 consider differing standards in relation  to  common  facts
                 where there are issues to be decided under  the  Rules  and
                 Article 8.  Is for example the question of whether a person
                 is a family  member  under  the  Immigration  Rules  to  be
                 considered on the balance of  probabilities  and  the  same
                 issue in relation to Article 8 to be considered to a  lower
                 standard?  What happens if the evidence is insufficient  to
                 satisfy the former but not the latter?  Uncertainty is  not
                 in the interest of justice."

  11. In my judgment, the Upper Tribunal in Ibrahim was correct.  Whilst the
      lower standard applies in cases where protection issues arise, largely
      because those issues  will  involve  a  judicial  assessment  of  what
      "might" happen in the future, that standard has no application where a
      decision maker is  assessing  evidence  and  making  factual  findings
      about, for example, whether a person  has  family  life  with  another
      individual, is related to them as claimed or whether their marriage is
      genuine.  In those circumstances, the correct standard of proof is the
      civil one, namely a balance of probabilities (see  e.g.,  Ali  v  SSHD
      [2006] EWCA Civ 484 per Keene LJ at [12] in the context  of  EU  law).
      It is not clear from the grant of permission to appeal to the Court of
      Appeal what likelihood there is of the Upper Tribunal's decision being
      overturned on this issue.  The grant indicates no more than  that  the
      point is arguable and, in fact, it may not even indicate that, as  the
      Court of Appeal may have granted permission in order  to  resolve  the
      point at the level of the Court of Appeal.  The grant itself does  not
      offer any view on the likelihood of success of  this  ground  and,  in
      granting permission to  appeal,  Sedley  LJ  himself  noted  that:  "I
      suspect the answer may depend on what the  specific  Article  8  issue
      is".

  12. That observation in my view presages the second reason why Mr  Hersi's
      submissions on this issue cannot succeed.  The point is  this  and  it
      is, in fact, made by Lord Wilson in [44] of  Quila  which  was  relied
      upon by Mr Hersi.  In [44] Lord Wilson (with whom Lords  Phillips  and
      Clarke and Lady Hale agreed) reiterated that the burden was  upon  the
      Secretary  of  State  to  establish  that  any  interference  with  an
      individual's rights  under  Article  8  was  justified.   Lord  Wilson
      continued:

           "but in an evaluation which transcends matters of fact it is not
           in my view apt to describe the requisite standard  of  proof  as
           being, for example, on the balance of probabilities."

  13. The point that Lord Wilson is making is this.  The standard  of  proof
      is a forensic tool used by courts or tribunals when assessing evidence
      and reaching factual findings.  It indicates the level of  assuredness
      that the court or tribunal must  have  before  reaching  any  finding.
      Where the judicial exercise involves, not making factual findings, but
      rather exercising discretion or reaching a  judgement  albeit  on  the
      basis of facts found, the concept of a  "standard  of  proof"  has  no
      place.  In other words, a discretion is exercised in a particular  way
      or a judgment is made or it is not.  It does not assist,  in  fact  it
      makes no sense, to speak of a standard of proof informing the judicial
      process of exercising discretion or  judgement  one  way  or  another.
      That latter process is precisely the "balancing  exercise"  undertaken
      in determining whether a particular decision is proportionate for  the
      purposes of Article 8.2.  That is, in my judgment,  what  Lord  Wilson
      had in mind in [44] as "an  evaluation  which  transcends  matters  of
      fact".   Of  course,  that  judgement  will  be  informed  by  factual
      findings in most if not all, cases but the balancing  exercise  itself
      involves no standard of proof as such.

  14. In this appeal, the Judge made a number of factual findings in  making
      an assessment of the proportionality of the decisions.   For  example,
      the Judge found that it would not be reasonable to expect  the  family
      to live in Ethiopia or Somalia.  Likewise, the Judge accepted that the
      marriage of the sponsor and first appellant was a  genuine  one.   The
      Judge also had found that  the  sponsor  had  insufficient  income  to
      maintain himself and the appellants in  the  UK  without  recourse  to
      public funds.  All those findings had to be made on the basis  of  the
      evidence  and  the  Judge  was  correct  to  apply  the   balance   of
      probabilities test.  The appellants do not  challenge  these  findings
      which, apart from the  maintenance  issue,  were  in  the  appellant's
      favour.  The appellants' challenge in these  appeals  to  the  Judge's
      decision under Article 8 is not to the factual  basis  upon  which  he
      found that Article 8 was not breached but  rather  to  his  assessment
      that the legitimate aim of the economic  well-being  of  the  country,
      reflected   in   effective   immigration   control,   outweighed   any
      interference with the family life of the sponsor with the  appellants.
      That was an evaluative exercise which, in the words  of  Lord  Wilson,
      "transcends matters of fact".  No standard of proof  applied  and  the
      appellants' argument that the Judge erred  in  failing  to  apply  the
      "real risk" test applicable in international protection cases  has  no
      purchase.

  15. As I have already indicated, in reality  the  factual  matters,  apart
      from the maintenance requirement which is no longer  challenged,  were
      resolved in the appellants'  favour.   Even  if,  therefore,  a  lower
      standard of proof applied (which  it  does  not)  any  error  did  not
      prejudice the appellants.

  16. Turning to Mr Hersi's second submission, he contended that  the  Judge
      had failed to give adequate reasons for finding that the  respondent's
      decisions were proportionate.  Mr Hersi submitted that  where  it  was
      unreasonable to expect  the  UK  based  party  to  relocate  then  the
      authority showed that it would normally be disproportionate.  Mr Hersi
      referred me to  the  Supreme  Court's  decision  in  Quila  where,  he
      submitted, a separation for three years for a  married  couple,  as  a
      result of the change in the Immigration Rules raising  the  lower  age
      for  entry  clearance  from   18   to   21   years,   was   considered
      disproportionate.  He relied upon the Court of  Appeal's  decision  in
      Muse v Entry Clearance Officer  [2012]  EWCA  Civ  10  at  [33]  where
      Toulson LJ stated, citing Lord Brown at [26] in South  Bucks  District
      Council v Porter(2) [2004] UKHL 33, that reasons  need  to  show  what
      conclusions were reached and how they were reached  on  the  essential
      issues.

  17. As  regards  the  Judge's  obligation  to  give  reasons  the  Chamber
      President summarised  the  correct  approach  in  the  Upper  Tribunal
      decision of Shizad (Sufficiency of Reasons:  Set  Aside)  [2013]  UKUT
      0083 (IAC) at [10]:

           "10.  We would emphasise that although there is a legal duty  to
                 give a brief explanation of the conclusions on the  central
                 issue on which the appeal is determined, such reasons  need
                 not be extensive if the decision as a  whole  makes  sense,
                 having regard  to  the  material  accepted  by  the  judge.
                 Although a decision may contain an error of law  where  the
                 requirements to give adequate reasons  are  not  met,  this
                 Tribunal would not normally set aside  a  decision  of  the
                 First-tier Tribunal where there has been no misdirection of
                 law, the fact-finding process cannot be criticised and  the
                 relevant Country Guidance is taken into account, unless the
                 conclusions that the judge  draws  from  the  primary  data
                 before him were not reasonably open to him."

  18. As Lord Brown stated in the case of South  Bucks  District  Council  v
      Porter (2) [2004] UKHL 33 at [26]:

           "26.  The reasons for a decision must be intelligible  and  they
                 must be adequate.  They must enable to reader to understand
                 why the matter was decided as it was and  what  conclusions
                 were   reached   on   the   'single   principal   important
                 controversial issues', disclosing how any issue of  law  or
                 fact was resolved.  Reasons  can  be  briefly  stated,  the
                 degree of particularity required depending entirely on  the
                 nature of the issues falling for decision."

  19.  I  set  out  above  the  Judge's  reasoning  at  para  36-46  of  her
      determination and, in particular at paras 41-46.  The  Judge  had,  of
      course, already set out in her determination the  background  evidence
      and made positive findings in the appellant's favour in respect of the
      validity of the parties' marriage and also  the  relationship  between
      the first and second appellants.  Apart from the issue of maintenance,
      none of the facts were essentially in dispute.   The  Judge's  adverse
      finding in relation to maintenance has not been challenged.  The Judge
      found, therefore, that the appellants could not meet the  requirements
      of the Immigration Rules, in particular  the  maintenance  requirement
      but also, in the case of the first  appellant,  the  English  language
      requirement.  The Judge found that there would be an interference with
      the family's private life as it would not be reasonable to expect  the
      sponsor as a British citizen and  refugee  either  to  live  with  his
      family in Ethiopia or, alternatively in Somalia.  The Judge recognised
      the inevitability of the split in the family.  At para  38  the  Judge
      directed herself in accordance with the House of  Lords'  decision  in
      Huang [2011] UKHL 11 at [20] that:

           "20.   The  ultimate  question...is  whether  the   [immigration
                 decision], in the circumstances where the life of a  family
                 cannot reasonably be  expected  to  be  enjoyed  elsewhere,
                 taking full  account  of  all  considerations  weighing  in
                 favour of the refusal, prejudices the family  life  of  the
                 applicant in a manner sufficiently serious to amount  to  a
                 breach of the fundamental right protected by Art 8."

  20. In my judgment, the Judge  grasped  the  essentials  of  the  parties'
      situation.  As Mr Avery pointed out in his  submissions,  the  parties
      had been married for only a short period of  time  and  they  had  not
      lived  together  in  the  UK.   The  appellants  could  not  meet  the
      requirements of the Immigration Rules, in particular  the  maintenance
      requirements.  Mr Avery submitted that was the crux of  the  Secretary
      of State's case before the Judge, namely  that  the  interference  was
      justified principally on the basis that the parties could not  support
      themselves without recourse to public funds.  He referred  me  to  the
      Court of Appeal's decision in AAO v  Entry  Clearance  Officer  [2011]
      EWCA Civ 840 at [49] where Rix LJ (with whom Lloyd LJ  and  Lewison  J
      agreed) stated that:

           "49.  As Strasburg and domestic jurisprudence  has  consistently
                 emphasised..., states are entitled to have regard to  their
                 system of immigration control and its generally  consistent
                 application, and a requirement that an  entrant  should  be
                 maintained  without  recourse  to  public   funds   is   an
                 ultimately fair and  necessary  limitation  on  what  would
                 otherwise become a possibly overwhelming burden on  all  of
                 its citizens.   It is an unfortunate reality of  life  that
                 states, especially one like the  United  Kingdom  which  is
                 generally  accessible  and  welcoming   to   refugees   and
                 immigrants cannot undertake  to  allow  all  members  of  a
                 family to join together here, even those  members  who  can
                 show emotional and financial dependency,  without  creating
                 supportable burdens."

  21. AAO was a case in  which  a  dependent  adult  relative  sought  entry
      clearance.  Mr Hersi submitted that the approach in [49] in AAO had no
      application here where entry was sought by a spouse and a child.  Some
      support for that can be found in [36] of Rix LJ's judgement  where  he
      stated:

           "36.  I can find no support in the jurisprudence, however, for a
                 positive duty to permit entry  of  a  parent  (spouses  and
                 minor children may present different problems) to  join  an
                 adult child even where the parent would require support  by
                 public funds." (my emphasis)

  22. Despite that tentative caveat, the general point, in my view,  remains
      good, namely that the fact that a person or persons seeking  entry  to
      the UK would be a burden on the public purse in the UK is  a  relevant
      and, in my view, important factor  when  carrying  out  the  balancing
      exercise inherent in the issue of proportionality.  It  was  a  factor
      that  the  Judge  had  well  in  mind  in  reaching  her  finding   on
      proportionality (see para 38).  The  Judge,  nevertheless,  recognised
      that the failure to comply with the  Immigration  Rules  was  not,  in
      itself, determinative of Article 8 (see para 40).

  23. Mr Hersi also submitted that the Judge had failed to take into account
      the "best interests" of the second appellant and the impact  upon  him
      as set out in the sponsor's witness statement in particular  at  paras
      11-14.  Mr Hersi relied upon passages in the  sponsor's  statement  at
      paras 13 and 14.  In the former, the sponsor says that his  son  (that
      is a reference in fact to his stepson) goes to a community  school  in
      Ethiopia run by the Somali community for two hours a day.  He says  it
      is not a proper school; he has  no  proper  structured  education  and
      sometimes his teacher does not turn up.  He states that his son  needs
      a proper education which is not available in Ethiopia.  At para 14 the
      sponsor states that his family has no  status  in  Ethiopia  and  they
      would be prisoners  in  their  own  home  and  the  first  and  second
      appellants rarely leave their house as his wife lives in constant fear
      that the second appellant will be taken away and be accused  of  being
      part of Al Shabab.

  24. It is far from clear to what extent these  matters  were  relied  upon
      before the Judge.  At para 44, she notes that  "the  second  appellant
      does not have a right  to  be  educated  in  the  UK  as  the  sponsor
      implies".  That clearly is correct.  The situation of  the  first  and
      second appellants in Ethiopia does not seem to have  been  central  to
      the appellants' case before the Judge.  It is not clear how  long  the
      appellants have lived in Ethiopia.   They have certainly done so since
      the middle of 2011 when the sponsor met  the  first  appellant  there.
      Nothing in the evidence before the Judge suggested that the  appellant
      did not have a home or that anything untoward had become of either  of
      them living in Ethiopia.  The second appellant was receiving schooling
      and they were financially supported by  the  sponsor.   The  sponsor's
      stated fears for his wife and son contrast with the sponsor's evidence
      (at para 7 of his statement) that when he was in Ethiopia he  and  the
      second appellant went  out  and  played  football  and  went  shopping
      together with the first appellant.  This was  not  a  case  where  the
      evidence demonstrated  that  the  second  appellant's  best  interests
      required that he live in the UK with his step-father rather than  with
      his mother in Ethiopia.

  25. In my judgement, although the Judge's  reasons  are  relatively  brief
      they are adequate.   They  identify  the  essential  features  of  the
      appellants' cases and the Judge makes a number of factual findings  in
      their favour.  The Judge had well in mind that she was concerned  with
      a situation where the parties would inevitably be separated.  She took
      into account the  genuineness  but  short  duration  of  the  parties'
      marriage and, correctly, noted that the second appellant  is  not  the
      sponsor's son and they had not spent a great deal  of  time  together.
      The separation of spouses is not  necessarily  disproportionate:  each
      case must turn upon an assessment of the individual circumstances.  In
      Quila Lord Wilson at [43], having  noted  that  the  separation  of  a
      married couple "must a fortiori represent...an interference", went  on
      to state that the: "only sensible enquiry  can  be  into  whether  the
      refusal [that gave rise to the interference] was justified."

  26.  On  the  facts  of  Quila,  the  Immigration  Rule  that  caused  the
      interference was found not to be proportionate.  There,  unlike  here,
      the justification rested upon a need to prevent forced marriages which
      the Supreme Court found could not justify that interference.  Here, as
      Mr Avery submitted, the justification is the economic wellbeing of the
      UK as the appellants cannot be maintained without recourse  to  public
      funds.   That was the balancing exercise which  the  Judge  undertook.
      The parties had no expectation of living in the United Kingdom without
      compliance with the Immigration Rules which they could not  establish.
      There was limited evidence of any adverse consequences to  the  second
      appellant if he remains in Ethiopia living with his mother,  which  he
      has done for sometime in their own home, financially supported by  the
      sponsor.  Again, this was not a case where the second appellant's best
      interests require that he lives in the UK with his step-father  rather
      than  with  his  mother  in  Ethiopia.   As  the  Judge  noted,  those
      circumstances might change in the future if the appellant  could  meet
      the language requirement and the sponsor increased his earnings in the
      UK.

  27. In my judgement, the Judge gave adequate reasons for her finding  that
      the  respondent's  decisions  were  proportionate.  In  reaching  that
      finding the Judge took into account the circumstances of  the  sponsor
      in the UK and the appellants in  Ethiopia  and  the  inevitability  of
      their separation if entry clearance was refused.  Her ultimate finding
      that,  in  the  particular  circumstances  of   these   appeals,   the
      interference with the family life of the appellants  and  sponsor  was
      proportionate and was a decision that was properly open to her on  the
      evidence.

  28. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal  did  not  err  in  law  in
      dismissing the appellants' appeals under Article 8 of the ECHR.

  29. The First-tier Tribunal's decision to dismiss each of the  appellants'
      appeals stands.
