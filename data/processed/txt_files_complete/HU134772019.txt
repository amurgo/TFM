This decision follows a remote hearing in respect of which  there  has  been
no objection by the parties. The form of remote hearing was by  video  (V),
the platform was Microsoft Teams. A face to face hearing was  not  held  as
all issues could be fairly determined via a remote hearing.

                            DECISION AND REASONS



Background

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal G J Ferguson ("the judge"), promulgated on  21  May  2020,
         dismissing the human rights appeal of  Mr  Sayed  Mohammad  Ghobadi
         ("the appellant") against a decision of  the  respondent  dated  17
         July 2019 refusing the appellant's human rights claim.

      2. The appellant is a national of Iran who was born on 28  June  1993.
         He entered the UK in January 2009 as a 15  year  old  unaccompanied
         minor. An asylum claim based on the alleged political activities of
         the appellant's father and the appellant's claim that  the  Iranian
         authorities discovered a listening device the appellant planted  in
         Basij offices was rejected and an appeal dismissed on 5  May  2011.
         Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Braybrook  did  not  find  the
         appellant's  account  relating  to  the  listening  device  to   be
         credible.

      3. The appellant's next application was  an  Article  8  human  rights
         claim made on 28 April 2018. This was based on the private life the
         appellant had established in the UK. The respondent considered  the
         application by reference to para 276ADE(1)(vi) of  the  Immigration
         Rules but was not satisfied that there would be  'very  significant
         obstacles' to the appellant's integration  in  Iran.  Nor  was  the
         respondent satisfied there were exceptional circumstances  such  as
         to render the refusal of  the  appellant's  human  rights  claim  a
         disproportionate interference with his rights protected by  Article
         8 ECHR. The Refusal  Letter  indicated  that  the  appellant  could
         contact the Home Office Voluntary Returns Service (VRS) for help on
         returning to Iran and that the VRS could, inter alia,  help  obtain
         travel documents, help with the cost of tickets, and in some  cases
         provide other financial and practical assistance once the appellant
         had returned to his home country. Details on how to contact the VRS
         were provided.

      4. The appellant appealed the respondent's refusal of his human rights
         claim  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  pursuant  to  s.82   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The appeal  was  also
         principally based on the nature and extent of the private life  the
         appellant had established in the UK and, in particular,  the  close
         connections he had established with a network of  friends  and  his
         relationship with his close friend Mr Saed Ali Alavi and Mr Alavi's
         family, including his children.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      5. The judge had before him a large bundle of  documents  prepared  by
         the appellant that included, inter alia, a witness  statement  from
         the appellant, witness statement from Mr Alavi,  reference  letters
         from other individuals who knew the appellant, various photographs,
         certificates and awards relating to the  appellant,  and  a  report
         dated 11 March 2018 by Ms Angeline Seymour who  is  an  Independent
         Social Worker  (ISW).  The  judge  heard  oral  evidence  from  the
         appellant  and  from   Mr   Alavi   and   submissions   from   both
         representatives.

      6. In his decision the judge summarised  the  appellant's  immigration
         history and the basis of his human rights claim, the evidence given
         by  the  appellant  and  Mr  Alavi,  and  set  out  the   competing
         submissions  from  the  representatives.  In  the  section  of  his
         decision headed "Discussion" the judge noted that  the  appeal  was
         being advanced on the  basis  that  there  were  'very  significant
         obstacles' to the appellant's return to Iran (para  276ADE(1)(vi)),
         and  on  the  basis   that   his   removal   would   constitute   a
         disproportionate breach of his Article 8 private and family life in
         the UK.

      7. At [13] the judge noted that the appellant had  not  made  a  fresh
         protection claim and had not adduced any new  evidence  that  could
         support such a claim. The judge stated:

             "He [the appellant] cannot rely on the  basis  of  his  asylum
             claim as a reason to conclude there would be very  significant
             obstacles to his return in circumstances where his  claim  was
             found not to give rise to any real risk of persecution. In her
             skeleton argument Ms Tobin refers to the "subjective  fear  of
             return as a result of his father's death in  custody  and  his
             own actions against the Basij" but those were not  established
             to the low standard of proof to be  objectively  well-founded.
             His subjective fear did  not  determine  the  outcome  of  the
             asylum appeal any more than his subjective belief  that  there
             will be very significant obstacle to his return determines the
             outcome under paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)."

      8. At [14] the  judge  considered  the  other  issues  that  had  been
         "highlighted" on the appellant's behalf as constituting significant
         obstacles to his integration. In respect of the contention that the
         appellant  would  be  homeless  on  return  the  judge  noted,   as
         highlighted in the Refusal Letter, that the appellant would be able
         to apply for financial assistance in returning from the  VRS  which
         would mean that he would have the financial resources  to  pay  for
         accommodation well he settled back into life in Iran. The judge was
         not satisfied that the  appellant  established  that  he  would  be
         homeless. The judge then noted that  a  submission  concerning  the
         significance of widespread corruption  amongst  officials  had  not
         been further developed in the context of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).
         The judge noted that there was no established direct  link  between
         corruption and the appellant's ability to find work  in  Iran.  The
         judge observed:

             "He [the appellant] retains ties  to  Iran  through  language,
             religion and culture and  there  is  no  medical  evidence  to
             establish that he would be unable to find work."

      9. At [15]  the  judge  noted  the  absence  of  radical  evidence  to
         establish that the appellant would have very significant  obstacles
         to his integration in Iran for medical  reasons.  The  judge  noted
         that the appellant suffered from depression and anxiety  about  his
         unresolved immigration status but that the appellant  confirmed  at
         the hearing that he was not taking any medication. The judge  noted
         the absence of any evidence that if the appellant was  required  to
         resume taking the antidepressant tablets  that  he  stopped  taking
         about 2017 these would not be available to him in Iran. At [16] the
         judge stated:

             "Although  there  may  be  some  initial  hardship  for   [the
             appellant] in returning to Iran after a decade  spent  in  the
             UK, the rule requires  "very  significant  obstacles"  to  his
             integration and the evidence does not establish that he  meets
             this requirement of paragraph 276 ADE."

     10. The judge proceeded to then  consider  the  appeal  in  respect  of
         Article 8 outside the Immigration  Rules.  No  challenge  has  been
         levelled against this aspect of the judge's decision and it is  not
         necessary for me to summarise  the  judge's  careful  and  detailed
         evaluation. Having concluded that the appellant did  not  meet  the
         requirements of para 276ADE(1)(vi) and that his removal  would  not
         otherwise be disproportionate under Article 8, the judge  dismissed
         the appeal.

The challenge to the judge's decision

     11.  The  grounds  of  appeal,  amplified  by  Mr  Lemer  in  his  oral
         submissions, contend that the judge conducted a  flawed  assessment
         of  the  'very  significant  obstacles'  test.  The  grounds   only
         challenge the judges assessment under  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of
         the Immigration Rules, a point confirmed by Mr Lemer at the  'error
         of law' hearing.

     12. The judge, it is argued, failed  to  adopt  the  appropriate  broad
         evaluative approach to the issue of  integration,  as  detailed  in
         SSHD v Kamara [2016] EWCA Civ 813 ("Kamara") by failing to consider
         material matters and in considering matters that were not relevant.
         Specifically, the judge failed to give  any  consideration  to  the
         appellant having arrived in the UK as a minor and  thus  having  no
         experience of life as an adult in Iran, as detailed in the skeleton
         argument prepared for the First-tier Tribunal. The  fact  that  the
         appellant left Iran as a minor was a  key  element  in  determining
         whether the appellant would be enough of an insider to  enable  him
         to operate on  a  day-to-day  basis  and  build  up  relationships.
         Further, the judge, it is argued, failed to make  any  findings  or
         give any consideration to the  appellant's  account  of  having  no
         contact with his family or friends in  Iran.  The  grounds  further
         contend that the judge's reliance on  the  financial  support  that
         appellant would receive via the VRS was flawed given the absence of
         any evidence as to the level of support that would be  provided  or
         how long such support would last. The reference to the VRS  in  the
         Refusal Letter was said to be vague and incapable of supporting the
         judge's assessment.

     13. On behalf of the respondent Mr Tan invited  me  to  find  that  the
         judge was well aware of the appellant's age  and  that  he  had  no
         experience of life in Iran as an adult, that the judge proceeded on
         the basis that the appellant did not have any family in  Iran  with
         whom he was in contact, and that the  judge  was  entitled  to  his
         conclusion relating to the ability of the appellant  to  apply  for
         financial assistance under the VRS scheme.

Discussion

     14. Both SSHD v Kamara and AS v SSHD [2017] EWCA  Civ  1284  considered
         the concept of "integration" in s.117C(4)(c) of the  2002  Act  and
         paragraph 399A of the immigration rules. The assessment is  however
         equally applicable to the  'very  significant  obstacles'  test  in
         paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules. In  Kamara  Sales
         LJ, with whom Moore-Bick LJ agreed, stated, at [14],

             "In my view, the concept of a foreign criminal's "integration"
             into the country to which it is proposed that he be  deported,
             as set out in section 117C(4)(c)  and  paragraph  399A,  is  a
             broad one. It is not confined to the mere ability  to  find  a
             job or to sustain life while living in the other  country.  It
             is not appropriate to treat the statutory language as  subject
             to some gloss and it will usually be sufficient for a court or
             tribunal simply to direct itself in the terms that  Parliament
             has chosen to use. The idea of "integration" calls for a broad
             evaluative judgment to be made as to  whether  the  individual
             will be enough of an insider in  terms  of  understanding  how
             life in the society in that other country is carried on and  a
             capacity to participate in it, so  as  to  have  a  reasonable
             opportunity to be accepted there, to be able to operate  on  a
             day-to-day basis in that society and  to  build  up  within  a
             reasonable time a  variety  of  human  relationships  to  give
             substance to the individual's private or family life."

     15. In AS Lord Justice Moylan  rejected  a  submission  that  so-called
         "generic" factors, such as intelligence, health, employability  and
         general robustness of character, were irrelevant when  assessing  a
         person's ability to integrate, and held that such  factors  can  be
         relevant  to  whether  there  are  very  significant  obstacles  to
         integration as they form part of the  "broad  evaluative  judgment"
         (at [58] and [59]). The Court of Appeal rejected a submission  that
         the issue whether someone was "enough of  an  insider"  was  to  be
         determined by reference to their ties to the  country  of  proposed
         removal.

     16. The judge did not expressly refer to Kamara, but this does  not  of
         itself constitute an error of law if the judge  has,  nevertheless,
         undertaken  a  broad  evaluative  assessment.  The  judge  properly
         directed himself as to the proper test in  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
         and undertook that  assessment  by  reference  to  the  appellant's
         circumstances and the evidence upon which he relied.

     17. A careful assessment of the judge's  decision  shows  that  he  was
         demonstrably aware that the appellant entered the UK as a minor and
         that he had resided in this country since 2009 (see [1], [3],  [9],
         [16], [29]). The judge was not required to repeat or refer  to  all
         the evidence before him when completing the  'reasons'  section  of
         his decision and the judge's analysis must  be  considered  in  the
         context of his full written decision. It is irresistibly clear from
         the decision that the judge was aware that the  appellant  had  not
         resided in Iran as an adult and that he had not worked in  Iran  or
         experienced life there as an  adult.  The  judge  was  nevertheless
         satisfied that the appellant would  be  able  to  reintegrate  into
         Iranian society having regard to his age when he left  the  country
         (the judge was additionally aware that the appellant was almost  27
         years old at the date of the judge's decision), his  retained  ties
         to Iran through language, religion and culture, and the absence  of
         any cogent medical evidence that he would be unable to  find  work.
         These were relevant factors when undertaking the  broad  evaluative
         assessment. In this context the judge  did  not  fail  to  consider
         relevant matters.

     18. The judge was also demonstrably aware of the appellant's  claim  to
         have no family or friends in Iran (see the judge's  record  of  the
         appellant's evidence at [3], [5], and the submissions made  on  his
         behalf  at  [9]).  The  judge's   assessment   of   the   paragraph
         276ADE(1)(vi) test at [14] to [16], properly understood,  proceeded
         on the basis that the appellant did not have any friends or  family
         in Iran. Whilst there  was  no  explicit  finding  on  this  point,
         nothing in the decision, considered as a whole, suggests  that  the
         judge approached the question of integration on the basis that  the
         appellant had a network of support available to him in Iran.  Given
         the various references in the decision to the absence of any family
         or friends in Iran, this was a matter in respect of which the judge
         was aware and which he must be deemed to have taken into account.

     19. It was for the appellant to prove, on the balance of probabilities,
         that there are "very significant obstacles" to his  integration  in
         Iran. The Refusal Letter made the appellant aware that  he  may  be
         eligible for financial assistance  through  the  VRS.  The  contact
         details for the VRS where provided, including  the  relevant  World
         Wide Web address. The judge was entitled to note that the appellant
         was able  to  apply  for  financial  assistance.  It  was  for  the
         appellant to prove that he would not be  eligible  to  receive  any
         financial assistance via the VRS scheme as an element of  the  test
         in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  The  appellant  did  not  provide  any
         evidence to the First-tier Tribunal of his ineligibility. There was
         no evidence before the First-tier Tribunal, or  indeed  before  the
         Upper Tribunal, that the appellant was incapable of fulfilling  the
         requirements for financial assistance under the VRS. I am,  in  the
         alternative and in any event, satisfied that the judge was entitled
         to take judicial notice of the fact that the appellant could  apply
         for financial assistance up to �3000 through the VRS  scheme  given
         that he had an asylum claim refused and  that  he  was  in  the  UK
         illegally and was returning to a developing country. In the absence
         of any evidence that  the  appellant  would  not  be  eligible  for
         financial assistance, the judge was entitled to take  into  account
         the appellant's ability to apply for financial assistance.

     20. I consequently find that the judge's decision discloses no error on
         a point of law. The appeal is dismissed.



Notice of Decision

The judge's decision did not involve the making of an error on  a  point  of
law.

The human rights appeal is dismissed.
