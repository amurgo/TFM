For the Appellant:     Mr Sharma, of Matthew Cohen and Associates,
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Young, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of India, born on 5th January 1980.  He came
    to the UK as a student on 21st September 2010.  By written  application
    dated 25th January 2013 he sought further leave to remain  outside  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules, giving these reasons:-

         (1)  My right to a private and family life  under  Article  8  ECHR
             would be infringed.  I am in a close and  loving  relationship
             with my EEA fianc�e.

          (2) I  will  be  detained/ill-treated  by  Indian  authorities  if
             returned to India.

 2. By letter and notice dated 17th June 2013 the  respondent  refused  the
    appellant's application by reference to the  family  and  private  life
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules,   finding   no   exceptional
    circumstances, and informed the appellant of his liability  to  removal
    to India.  Regarding the  alleged  threat  from  the  authorities,  the
    appellant was advised  that  a  request  for  international  protection
    should be made in  person  by  booking  an  appointment  at  an  Asylum
    Screening Unit (ASU).

 3. The appellant did not act on that suggestion, but appealed to the First-
    tier Tribunal on the following grounds:

           (1)    The appellant is in a relationship with an EU national and
             his removal will affect his and his partner's rights to family
             life conferred by Article 8 ECHR.

           (2)    The appellant has threat to his life  from  his  estranged
             wife  and  her  family.   They  have  lodged  false   criminal
             complaints against the Appellant  in  India.   If  removed  to
             India he fears threat to his life.

 4. First-tier Tribunal Judge P A  Grant-Hutchison  heard  the  appellant's
    appeal on 27th January 2014.  The appellant  and  his  girlfriend  gave
    evidence.  She is a citizen of Poland who has worked in Denmark for the
    last seven years.  They plan to marry when he is free to  do  so.   The
    appellant had begun divorce proceedings in Scotland against his wife in
    India.  His concern over return to India was that his estranged wife, a
    police officer, has raised a false domestic violence allegation against
    him under section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.

 5. In his  determination  promulgated  on  1st  February  2014  the  judge
    observed that the Article 3 matter would have been more aptly raised as
    an asylum claim.   However,  the  ground  of  appeal  was  procedurally
    available and the judge correctly found that he was bound  to  consider
    it.

 6. The judge noted objective evidence that  section  498A  of  the  Indian
    Penal Code is open to abuse, but he rejected the Appellant's particular
    allegations at �15.  At �16 he found in the alternative that a  section
    498A complaint did not engender a breach of Article 3, India  being  in
    general a country which operates under law.

 7. Turning to Article 8, the judge found no good reason to go outwith  the
    framework of the Immigration Rules (�23).  He went on to  observe  that
    the appellant's relationship with his girlfriend,  established  largely
    through the internet but also through visits, did not amount to  family
    life, and that there would be no significant  infringement  of  private
    life.

 8. The appellant's first ground of appeal to the Upper Tribunal  complains
    that the judge's  finding  at  �15  goes  against  the  weight  of  the
    evidence.  It insists that documents obtained from  India  are  genuine
    and that if the Appellant were to be imprisoned as a result of  such  a
    process this would "breach his Article 3 rights".   It  also  complains
    that the finding at �16 that India operates under law does not  exclude
    an Article 3 risk to the Appellant.

 9. Ground 2 criticises the judge's finding that there was no  family  life
    in the UK.  It is said that the appellant and his fianc�e cannot  enjoy
    family life in India, because he would be put in prison as soon  as  he
    arrives, and that he should be granted one year's  discretionary  leave
    in order to finalise his divorce in the UK and to marry his fianc�e.

10. Ground 3 is taken against the finding that the wife  of  the  Appellant
    does not work for  the  police  in  Delhi  and  insists  again  on  the
    genuineness of the documents obtained.

11. In oral submissions Mr Sharma  summarised  his  points  thus:  (1)  the
    adverse credibility finding misapprehended and was against  the  weight
    of the evidence; (2) the judge accepted evidence of this particular law
    being abused, and erred by finding  that  was  overcome  because  India
    generally applies the rule of law; and (3) the judge erred in  thinking
    that the appellant could have family and private life anywhere but  the
    UK, and so should have allowed the appeal also  under  Article  8.   Mr
    Sharma referred to documents showing proceedings against the  appellant
    in India, including one which records the appellant's mother saying  in
    a complaint that the appellant's wife is a constable in the  police  in
    Delhi, and that her daughter-in-law had registered a case  against  the
    appellant's  family.   This  is  not  item   JK2   mentioned   in   the
    determination, which is also numbered as page  20  of  the  appellant's
    First-tier Tribunal bundle, but page 28 (there are varying  and  rather
    confusing numbers and references on the documents, which seem  to  have
    been used in various contexts.)  Mr Sharma  sought  also  to  introduce
    further evidence from India to prove that the appellant's wife (now ex-
    wife) is a police officer.  He also  said  that  at  �11(a)  the  judge
    misunderstood his submission about police actions in India.  Page 28 of
    the bundle showed that police officers had gone to carry out  a  search
    connected with the wife's complaint at the home of his family  members,
    but it was on an air force station and guards did not allow them to  do
    so without a court order.  This showed that the  police  had  tried  to
    carry out an illegal search on her behalf.  As to Article 3 risk, there
    were so many articles about abuse of section 498A, which  was  admitted
    even by the Supreme Court of India, that the judge ought to  have  held
    it proved.  As to Article 8, the appellant has now obtained  a  divorce
    from the Sheriff Court in  Aberdeen,  and  could  produce  the  extract
    decree if error of law were to be found and updating evidence admitted.
     The appellant had a right under Article 8 to the grant of leave  which
    he sought, one year, in order to marry his girlfriend, which  would  be
    possible only in the UK.

12. Mr Young submitted that the judge  was  right  to  say  that  only  one
    document mentioned the appellant's wife being a police officer, and the
    attribution of a wrong page reference for that was insignificant.   The
    source of the information was not official, but the appellant's mother.
     There was admittedly a sheaf of documents about legal  proceedings  in
    India concerning the appellant and his wife, which the  judge  did  not
    mention.   Even if there were some error in that, the judge  was  right
    to point out that if the appellant thought this to be a real  risk,  he
    could have raised it well before he did.  More importantly,  the  judge
    was right to find in the  alternative  that  any  proceedings  pose  no
    Article 3 risk.  It was for  the  appellant  to  prove  that.   If  the
    proceedings are genuine, it is plain that they are  vigorously  opposed
    on the appellant's side.  He has access to lawyers in India.  A process
    of detention and trial, even if the offence is non-bailable,  does  not
    equate to risk of ill-treatment.  As  to  Article  8,  the  Immigration
    Rules amount to an almost complete code.  The appellant did not suggest
    that he met the requirements of the Rules, and showed no good reason to
    go outside the Rules.  Nor did he show anything to  prevent  him,  once
    free from his previous marriage, from marrying his girlfriend in the UK
    - or in Denmark, Poland or elsewhere.

13. Mr Sharma in reply said that the Registrar at Aberdeen would not  allow
    the marriage to go forward unless the appellant produced  his  passport
    and a valid visa, and that the respondent currently  has  the  passport
    and (if asked) would decline to release or exhibit it for  purposes  of
    the appellant showing his identity to the Registrar.  He accepted  that
    there was no evidence or submissions on this aspect in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  He said that  the  appellant  advised  him  that  the  local
    authority website states that a  passport  is  required,  and  that  he
    cannot go anywhere to marry until he gets his passport and a visa.

14. I reserved my determination.

15. It would have made for a much more satisfactory  consideration  of  the
    case if the appellant had made his protection claim at an  ASU  in  the
    usual way requested by the respondent, rather than by  adding  it  into
    his application based on family and private life and then stating it as
    a ground of appeal.  As the judge observed at �15, the  respondent  did
    not have an opportunity  to  interview  the  appellant.   There  is  no
    substantive refusal letter on the matter and  the  respondent  has  not
    taken any considered position on the background evidence of risk of the
    nature alleged.  I raised the question again in the Upper Tribunal  why
    the appellant elected to proceed as  he  did,  and  the  question  went
    unanswered.  However, the issue now is whether the judge went wrong  as
    a matter of law in resolving as he did the  case  which  the  appellant
    offered to prove.

16. The Indian court documents in the appellant's bundle before the  First-
    tier Tribunal show acrimonious proceedings between  the  appellant  and
    his wife, or their families.  They do not all relate to a section  498A
    complaint, but it would be a  radical  conclusion  that  they  are  all
    fabrications.  The judge did not go so far as to find  that  they  are,
    but they provide a context in which the  conclusion  at  �15  that  the
    appellant has not been complained about to the Indian police  might  be
    doubted.  However, that was a conclusion open to  the  judge;  he  gave
    reasons;  and  a  conclusion  to  the  contrary  would  not  make   the
    appellant's case.

17. It can also be drawn from the court documents that the appellant's side
    of any proceedings is being vigorously fought. The  appellant  did  not
    develop any coherent case that he could not  vindicate  his  rights  in
    legal proceedings in  India  without  infringement  of  his  Article  3
    rights.  His case assumed that it would be sufficient to show that such
    proceedings exist, that they are sometimes taken by vindictive spouses,
    and that he was liable to be detained, the alleged offence  being  non-
    bailable.    That   was   misconceived.    Pre-trial   detention,   and
    prosecutions on  malicious  complaints,  happen  everywhere.    Without
    more, those are matters for resolution in the  country  concerned,  not
    for international protection.

18. The submission that the police attempted an illegal search on behalf of
    the appellant's wife, and that this was overlooked by the  judge,  read
    too much into the evidence.  It is an account  that  officers  attended
    with a view to conducting a search, and went no  further  when  told  a
    warrant would be required.  That might happen anywhere,  and  does  not
    show attempted  abuse.   Much  the  same  applies  to  the  appellant's
    proposed reading of the background evidence that the Supreme Court  and
    the Law Commission in India accept that there is  a  major  problem  of
    malicious complaints under  section 498A.  There is a letter  from  the
    Chairman of the Law Commission, a former Judge of the Supreme Court, on
    this subject dated 30 August 2012 at page 35 of the appellant's bundle.
     It says that the extent of abuse  is  "not  established  by  empirical
    data" and is "not a ground to denude the  provision  of  its  efficacy,
    keeping in view the larger societal interest".

19. The appellant did not show in the First-tier Tribunal that  the  Indian
    legal system is incapable of resolving cases  such  as  this,  or  that
    those affected are at risk of ill-treatment reaching the level required
    for protection in terms of Article 3.  His appeal to the Upper Tribunal
    is substantially reargument and to  some  extent  exaggeration  of  his
    case, and falls short of  showing  any  material  error.   The  judge's
    conclusion on the fundamental point at �16 is brief, but adequate.

20. The same applies to the judge's finding that there was no good arguable
    case requiring him to look  outside  the  Rules  regarding  family  and
    private life; and even if he had shown legal or practical  difficulties
    in the way of his marriage in the UK, that is not a situation where  he
    has a right under Article 8 to  be  granted  leave  for  that  purpose,
    notwithstanding that he cannot meet the requirements of the Rules.
