                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Selway, a Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr C Bates, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant claims to be a citizen of Syria,  born  on  6th  November
    1979.  He entered the  United  Kingdom  on  28th  August  2015,  having
    claimed to have left Syria on 25th April 2015, then claimed  asylum  on
    16th October 2015.

2.   The appellant insists that he is from Um  Hosh  in  Aleppo.   When  his
    home area came under attack and his home  was  destroyed  by  a  barrel
    bomb, he says that he left the area.  He  fears  being  killed  in  the
    conflict if he were to return to Syria.

3.   For reasons set out in the respondent's decision letter  of  5th  April
    2016, the respondent  did  not  believe  the  appellant's  account  and
    neither did the respondent believe his claim to be a citizen of  Syria.



4.   The appellant appealed the respondent's decision  and  his  appeal  was
    heard by a First-tier Tribunal Judge at  North  Shields  on  6th  April
    2017.  The judge, First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Sills,  noted  that  the
    respondent relied on a language analysis report  which  indicated  that
    the appellant  was  not  Syrian,  but  rather  came  from  Egypt.   The
    appellant gave an explanation to the respondent as to why  his  use  of
    Arabic was consistent with that of  an  Egyptian  and  gave  inaccurate
    answers to questions about Syria at his interview.

5.   The judge heard oral evidence at the hearing and  at  paragraph  16  of
    his determination he considered the  linguistic  origin  identification
    (LOID) report.  He noted that the language  analysis  clearly  suggests
    that the results obtained most likely are inconsistent with the claimed
    linguistic community.  He noted that this was the second highest  level
    of certainty.  The report concluded that the analysis somewhat suggests
    that the results obtained more likely than not are consistent with  the
    appellant being from the Cairo  area  of  Egypt.   This  is  the  third
    highest level of certainty.  He also noted that the report  made  clear
    that it was  not  of  itself  determinative  of  nationality  and  that
    linguistic and political borders do not necessarily coincide.

6.   The judge observed that the  report  was  carried  out  by  a  linguist
    educated to Masters level and by native speakers from Aleppo, Syria and
    from Cairo, Egypt.  The judge said that having considered the report in
    detail, he considered that it was entitled to significant  weight.   He
    went on  to  consider  the  appellant's  explanation  for  speaking  an
    Egyptian form of Arabic and noted that the appellant relied on a Syrian
    individual civil record.  He also noted the evidence of  the  appellant
    in relation to the knowledge of his Syrian  home  area  and  had  taken
    account  of  the  appellant's  age  when  assessing   the   appellant's
    credibility, noting that he was now 19 years of age and had  only  been
    17ï¿½ when he claimed to have left Syria.

7.   The judge concluded that the LOID report, while not determinative,  was
    significant evidence casting doubt  on  the  appellant's  claim  to  be
    Syrian.    He believed the appellant's evidence of his contact with his
    family to be unsatisfactory and believed that the incorrect information
    the appellant had provided about his home area  suggested  he  was  not
    from that area.  The judge found that the appellant had not  discharged
    the burden of proof on him to show that he was a  Syrian  national  and
    therefore dismissed the appeal.

8.   The appellant challenged the appeal complaining that  the  judge  erred
    firstly by not considering or following case law on  language  analysis
    reports to which he was referred including Secretary of State v MN  and
    YK [2014] UKSC 30, which  referred  to  the  need  to  examine  reports
    critically, secondly starting with the report and not balancing it with
    all the evidence, thirdly in his approach to the appellant's Syrian  ID
    document and fourthly his in approach to  the  appellant's  answers  to
    questions about Syria.

9.   Mr Selway suggested that in saying as he did at paragraph 16, that  the
    judge considered that the report was entitled  to  significant  weight,
    the judge had erred in law.  The  report  was  not,  he  said,  clearly
    considered by the judge and it was wrong of the judge to start with the
    report and then having decided that he would give it significant weight
    to go on to consider all the other evidence.

10.  The appellant was taken by surprise when he was told of  the  existence
    of the report and he gave an explanation as  to  why  he  may  have  an
    Egyptian dialect.  His father worked with an  Egyptian  baker  and  the
    appellant had travelled to the United Kingdom with Egyptians he met  on
    his travels.  He had picked up their dialect.   Mr  Bates  reminded  me
    that the burden of proof was on the appellant to prove his nationality.
     The report relied on  by  the  Secretary  of  State  was  prepared  by
    experienced and qualified linguists and  two  analysts.   However,  the
    Secretary of State does not rely solely on the LOID report.  In dealing
    with the report, one of the authors was a qualified  linguist  and  the
    other two were experienced speakers.  The judge was  entitled  to  have
    regard to the report and to have regard to  the  answer  given  by  the
    appellant when asked to explain his Egyptian dialect.

11.  The appellant said it was because of an  Egyptian  baker  working  with
    his father and because he had travelled with Egyptians  from  Syria  to
    the United Kingdom that he had acquired an Egyptian  sounding  dialect.
    The judge did not believe that it could be  remotely  likely  that  the
    appellant could have been so strongly influenced by  Egyptians  he  met
    travelling from Syria to the United  Kingdom  or  by  a  colleague  who
    worked with his father.

12.  The appellant claimed that he had been in contact with his brother  who
    lived in Jordan, but was not in contact with his family in Syria.   His
    brother in Jordan was in contact with his family in Syria and the judge
    could not understand how the appellant's  brother  could  have  contact
    with family in Syria, when this was not  possible  for  the  appellant.
    His explanation was that the family his parents were staying with had a
    special SIM card and that the brother was able to call his parents.  He
    had been told, however, it was nearly impossible for the  appellant  to
    contact them.  The appellant then said that it  was  his  parents  that
    called the appellant's brother, but that the brother had not given  his
    parents the appellant's number as they would not  be  able  to  contact
    him.  The judge  did  not  accept  the  evidence,  believing  that  the
    appellant changed his account and offered  no  explanation  as  to  why
    international calls were possible between Syria  and  Jordan,  but  not
    between the UK and Syria.  He believed  this  to  be  damaging  to  the
    appellant's credibility.

13.  The Presenting Officer pointed  out  that  the  judge  applied  Tanveer
    Ahmed v Secretary of State for the Home Department* [2002] UKAIT  00439
    to the Syrian individual civil record and noted  that  the  appellant's
    evidence  as  to  how  he  obtained  this  document  was  muddled.   He
    concluded, as he was entitled to, that the appellant's account  of  how
    he received the  document  was  unsatisfactory.   He  clearly  did  not
    believe it was  a  document  on  which  he  could  place  any  reliance
    following his application of Tanveer Ahmed.  The appellant demonstrated
    a vague knowledge of Syria and his claimed  home  area.   Some  of  the
    answers were correct, some were wrong, and some could not be  verified.
    His claim that ISIS had captured the town of Um Hosh in July 2014,  was
    wrong because it was not actually  captured  until  August  2015.   The
    judge believed this to be a significant inconsistency.  The  judge  has
    given cogent and logical reasons why he did not accept the  appellant's
    claim and properly took into account the appellant's age in making  his
    credibility findings.

14.  Mr Selway suggested that the LOID report was simply "not up to the  job
    "and it  was  not  conclusive  and  should  not  have  been  given  the
    significant weight the judge decided to give  to  it.   I  reserved  my
    determination.

15.  It is for an appellant to prove his nationality.  The appellant  claims
    to be from Syria.  If he is from Syria then, at the moment, he will  be
    successful in his claim to asylum.  However, the  respondent  concluded
    that the appellant was not  from  Syria.   The  judge  demonstrates  at
    paragraph 16 of his determination  that  he  has  considered  the  LOID
    report in some detail and the judge notes that the report itself  makes
    it  clear  that  it  is  not  determinative  of  nationality  and  that
    linguistic and political borders  do  not  necessarily  coincide.   The
    judge went on to consider the appellant's explanation for speaking with
    an Egyptian dialect.  He did not believe the  appellant's  explanation.
    He was entitled to make the finding he did that it was highly  unlikely
    that the appellant would have adopted this  form  of  speech  from  his
    father's colleague or that he would have been so strongly influenced by
    Egyptians he met travelling from Syria to the United Kingdom.

16.  The judge then  went  on  to  consider  the  appellant's  contradictory
    evidence concerning contact with his brother and his family.  Initially
    the appellant claimed that his brother was able to  call  his  parents,
    then he stated that it was his  parents  who  were  able  to  call  his
    brother.  He was not, however, able to explain why international  calls
    were possible between Syria and Jordan,  but  not  between  the  United
    Kingdom and Syria.  Again, these are findings which I believe the judge
    was entitled to make on the evidence before him.

17.  The appellant relied on a Syrian individual civil record and the  judge
    noted that there were no obvious anomalies with the document  and  that
    it could be a reliable document.  However, the appellant's evidence  as
    to how he obtained the document was muddled and it was for him to  show
    that it was a document that could be relied upon.

18.  The judge explained in some detail that  the  appellant  first  claimed
    that his brother had sent it to him from Syria.  He then said  that  it
    was his friend Aziz in the United Kingdom who obtained the document for
    him when he went back to Syria.   He  then  said  that  it  was  Aziz's
    brother who sent the document to Aziz in Birmingham from Damascus.  The
    judge noted that this  account  was  muddled  and  that  there  was  no
    evidence from Aziz either in the form of a letter or  in  the  form  of
    oral evidence.

19.  Having rejected the appellant's account of  only  being  able  to  have
    contact with his family, the appellant explained that  the  reason  why
    his family were not able to send him the document was that  they  could
    not afford to do it.  However, no evidence was placed before the  judge
    to show that it would not have been  possible  to  send  money  to  the
    appellant's family either from the United Kingdom, from Jordan or  from
    within Syria and nor was there any explanation as to why it  could  not
    have been sent using the internet.

20.  The judge believed that the  appellant's  explanation  as  to  why  the
    family  could  not  have  sent  the  documents  to  the  appellant  was
    inadequate.  That was a finding open to him.

21.  The appellant demonstrated a lack of knowledge of Syria  and  his  home
    area.  He was only 17ï¿½ at the time he left Syria, but  one  would  have
    expected him to know whether his home town was in the hands of ISIS  in
    July 2014 or August 2015.  The appellant claimed that  the  River  Nile
    ran through Syria and the judge found it  curious  that  the  appellant
    should mention the Nile River.  He then said that he meant Nile  Street
    and  again  the  judge  believed  that  this  evidence   affected   the
    appellant's credibility.

22.  In paragraph 24  of  the  judge's  determination,  he  states  that  he
    considers that the LOID report, while not determinative, is significant
    evidence casting doubt on the appellant's claim to be Syrian.   He  did
    not accept the criticisms of the  report  to  be  legitimate.   It  is,
    however, clear to me that the judge was influenced not  simply  by  the
    report but also by his other seriously damaging credibility findings.

23.  I believe that the judge was  entitled  to  find  as  he  did;  he  was
    cautious in his approach to the LOID report and when looking at all the
    evidence in the round he concluded at paragraph 24 that  the  appellant
    had not discharged the burden on him to  show  that  he  was  a  Syrian
    national.

24.  I do not believe that the making of  the  determination  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Sills involved the making of a material error of law.  I
    uphold the determination.  This appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
