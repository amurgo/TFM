                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This appeal was remitted to the Upper  Tribunal  by  the  Court  of
        Appeal in an order sealed on the 17th  August  2012.  The  relevant
        part of the Statement of Reasons which accompanied the order is  in
        the following terms:


     3.   The Respondent accepts that this appeal should be remitted to  the
          Upper  Tribunal  for  reconsideration  under  Article  15  of  the
          Qualification Directive only.  The  Upper  Tribunal  may  wish  to
           consider  whether  this  appeal  should  be  stayed  pending  the
     outcome of the reconsideration of HM (Iraq)


     2. MW was born in 1987 and left Iraq in April 2009. He entered the  UK
        on 5th May 2009 and claimed asylum two days later.  His  claim  was
        refused by the Secretary of State and an appeal against the refusal
        dismissed on all  grounds  by  Judge  Brennen  in  September  2009.
        Reconsideration of that decision was ordered  and  the  appeal  re-
        heard, but again dismissed by Upper Tribunal Judge Taylor  on  27th
        September 2010.  It  is  Judge  Taylor's  determination  which  was
        challenged before the Court of Appeal although her factual findings
        have not been set aside. They can be summarised as follows:


          i.  MW is a national of Iraq born and raised in Mosul. He  is  not
   at risk             on return as a result of his fathers activities [18].


     ii.  It is difficult to rely on what MW says as being objectively true.
   MW             has never been harmed and it is not the style of terrorist
                       organisations such as Ansar Al Sunna to  warn  people
   of potential            harm over a lengthy period  and  take  no  action
   against them [19].


     iii. Throughout the period MW worked  at  a  local  shop  on  the  same
   street as his own home. He would not have  done  so  if  the  thought  he
   was at risk  as  clearly  anyone  who  wanted  to  find  him  would  have
   been able to do so [20].


     iv.  There is a reasonable degree of  likelihood  that  his  mother  is
   dead,          but not because of the  death  certificate  which  is  not
   written in                   medical language [22].


     v.   MW's evidence that his brother died as a result  of  targeting  by
   Ansar          Al Sunna is not accepted [23].


     vi.  MW's account of his brother helping the coalition  forces  is  not
          consistent with his claim that  his  father  was  a  supporter  of
   Saddam              Hussein [24].


     vii. MW's evidence at interview was so unreliable as to the  nature  of
   the            threats that it cannot be relied  upon.  MW's  claim  that
   Ansar Al                Sunna combined  with  the  Kurds  to  attack  his
   family is not consistent              with the objective evidence [25].


     viii.    MW's brother was one of those unfortunately caught up  in  the
          indiscriminate violence in Mosul but was not specifically targeted
              [27].


     ix.  MW has not  established  that  he  has  a  well  founded  fear  of
          persecution on return either as a result  of  his  fathers  former
   activities              with the army or because his brother  worked  for
   the Coalition forces             [28].


     x.    According  to  the  psychotherapeutic  report  from  the  Sankofa
      Foundation  MW  functions  as  an  immature  12-year-old  capable   of
   limited  independent  living  but  heavily  dependent  upon   his   older
   friends [37].


     xi.  The evidence in the psychotherapeutic report on the evidence  from
          his many supporters is consistent with  the  appellant's  confused
          behaviour at interview i.e. that he is functioning at the level of
   a 12-          year-old child [38].


     xii. There has never been any evidence adduced by the  respondent  that
     MW has any form of support network  in  Iraq  outside  his  home  area.
   In the circumstances  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  him  to
   relocate [39].


     xiii.    MW has been in contact with a friend  Mohammed  who  lives  in
   Iraq           when he obtained documents in 2009. MW claimed his  friend
   could          not help him in Iraq although it was found he was able  to
   assist him              in obtaining  the  death  certificates  from  the
   hospital and will be in a             position to offer support [40].


          xiv.    MW  is  able  to  function  independently  in  the  United
   Kingdom. His            evidence was that he had had  a  job  as  an  ice
   cream seller in Iraq for a            number of years. He is  now  living
   in his own home and does his own              shopping  and  cooking  and
   attends college [41].


     3. Domestic country guidance case law remains HM and  others  (Article
        15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409(IAC) (October 2012) in  which  the
        Tribunal decided that:


     (i)  Whilst the focus of the present decision is the current  situation
   in         Iraq, nothing in the further evidence now available  indicates
   that the       conclusions that the Tribunal in HM  and  Others  (Article
   15(c)) Iraq         CG [2010]  UKUT  331  (IAC)  ("HM1")   reached  about
   country             conditions in Iraq were wrong;
     (ii)     As regards  the  current  situation,  the  evidence  does  not
   establish   that            the   degree   of   indiscriminate   violence
   characterising the current            armed conflict taking place in  the
   five central governorates in Iraq,        namely Baghdad, Diyala,  Tameen
   (Kirkuk), Ninewah, Salah Al-Din,          is at such a  high  level  that
   substantial grounds have been shown for       believing that any civilian
   returned there would solely on account  of           his  presence  there
   face a real risk of being subject to that threat;
     (iii)    Nor does the evidence establish that there is a real  risk  of
   serious        harm under Article 15(c) for civilians who  are  Sunni  or
   Shi'a or            Kurds or have former Ba'ath Party connections:  these
   characteristics         do not in themselves  amount  to  "enhanced  risk
   categories" under       Article 15(c)'s  "sliding  scale"  (see  [39]  of
   Elgafaji);
     (iv) Further evidence that has  become  available  since  the  Tribunal
   heard      MK (documents - relocation) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 126 (IAC) does
          not  warrant  any  departure  from  its  conclusions  on  internal
   relocation          alternatives in the KRG or  in  central  or  southern
   Iraq save that the      evidence  is  now  sufficient  to  establish  the
   existence  of  a  Central            Archive  maintained  by  the   Iraqi
   authorities retaining civil identity      records  on  microfiche,  which
   provides a further way in which a         person can identify  themselves
   and obtain a copy of their CSID,          whether from abroad  or  within
   Iraq.


     4. In HF  (Iraq)  and  others  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
        Department [2013] EWCA Civ 1276 the Claimant failed asylum  seekers
        unsuccessfully  challenged  the  most   recent   country   guidance
        decisions relating to Iraq. Although the case of MK was remitted to
        the Upper Tribunal on its facts, the country relevant findings were
        not set aside.


     5. Paragraph 339C of the Immigration Rules states:

         A person will be granted humanitarian  protection  in  the  United
    Kingdom if        the Secretary of State is satisfied that:


              (i) he is in the United Kingdom or has arrived at a  port  of
    entry in the               United Kingdom;
              (ii)    he does not  qualify  as  a  refugee  as  defined  in
    regulation 2 of  The                  Refugee  or  Person  in  Need  of
    International Protection  (Qualification)                   Regulations
    2006;
              (iii)   substantial grounds have  been  shown  for  believing
    that the person                 concerned, if returned to  the  country
    of return, would face a real risk                of  suffering  serious
    harm    and    is    unable,    or,     owing     to     such     risk,
    unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; and
              (iv)    he is not  excluded  from  a  grant  of  humanitarian
    protection.


         Serious harm consists of:
              (i)     the death penalty or execution;
              (ii)    unlawful killing;
               (iii)    torture  or  inhuman  or  degrading  treatment   or
    punishment of a                     person in the country of return; or


              (iv)    serious and individual threat to a civilian's life or
    person  by  reason  of                   indiscriminate   violence   in
    situations  of  international   or   internal                     armed
    conflict.



Discussion



     6. MW's case is based upon an alleged risk on return by reference to
        the levels of violence generally in Iraq and specifically in his
        home city of Mosul. It is also said that his personal circumstances
        support his claim to be entitled to a grant of international
        protection.  Mr Worthington referred to a report prepared by Dr
        Cowan, a consultant psychiatrist, who has diagnosed MW as suffering
        from social phobia, panic disorder, and generalised anxiety
        disorder. Dr Cowan is of the opinion MW is somebody who is barely
        able to support himself and she believes that he will have great
        difficulty in doing so if returned to Iraq.  It is said that this
        contradicts Judge Taylor's finding that in 2010 MW was able to live
        independently in the United Kingdom.


     7. Before the Court of Appeal MW was assisted by his McKenzie friend
        Mr Ilbarudi. This individual is referred to by Dr Cowan who is also
        said to have tried to help MW by attempting to relocate his family
        in Iraq but the home in Mosul was found to be empty. Mr Worthington
        submits that as MW does not have contact with his family and no
        means of contacting them at the family home he has no support
        network in Mosul.


     8. MW's case can be summarised as follows:


          a.  That he cannot relocate and so the assessment of risk has to
   be assessed in               relation to his hometown of Mosul.


          b.  The family home is empty and it is claimed he has no way of
   contacting              his family and no support network in Iraq.


          c.  It is submitted MW is childlike and erratic in his behaviour,
   socially                phobic and has panic disorders and would
   therefore not be able to access           other support and is more
   likely to run into trouble than ordinary civilians              on the
   Elgafaji analysis.


          d.  MW is unable to apply for a CSID in the UK because he has no
              identification documents. He has no family in Iraq to assist
   him to apply            for one and is likely to find a procedure on
   return too complicated.


          e.  MW faces a real risk of serious harm if returned to Iraq.


     9. The submission MW will be unable to obtain a CSID such as to
        enhance the risk he will face on return, or to support the claim
        that such a return is unreasonable, has no arguable merit.  In MK
        (documents - relocation) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00126 (IAC) the
        Tribunal held:


              (i) Since the lack of documentation relating to identity in
   the form of the                  Civil Status ID (CSID), Iraqi
   Nationality Certificate (INC) and Public               Distribution
   System (PDS) card (food ration card) is not ordinarily an
   insuperable problem, it is not a factor likely to make return to any
          part of Iraq unsafe or unreasonable. (a)  The CSID is an important
                  document, both in its own right and as a gateway to
   obtaining other                  significant documents such the INC and
   the PDS.   An inability to                replace the CSID is likely to
   entail inability to access the INC and                 PDS. (b) Although
   the general position is that a person who wishes                to
   replace a lost CSID is required to return to their home area in
     order to do so, there are procedures as described in this
          determination available which make it possible (i) for Iraqis
   abroad                  to secure the issue of a new CSID to them through
   the offices of the               local Iraqi Embassy; (ii) for Iraqis
   returned to Iraq without a CSID to                 obtain one without
   necessarily having to travel to their home
   area.  Such procedures permit family members to obtain such
     documentation from their home areas on an applicant's behalf or
     allow for a person to be given a power of attorney to obtain the same.
              Those who are unable immediately to establish their identity
   can                 ordinarily obtain documentation by being presented
   before a judge                   from the Civil Status Court, so as to
   facilitate return to their place of                origin.


    10. There is insufficient evidence that MW has attempted to approach
        the Iraqi authorities in the United Kingdom requesting them to
        issue him with a new CSID which he could do with the assistance of
        his legal representatives or his friend in the United Kingdom, or
        if such an application has been made it has been refused, and on
        what basis.


    11. It has not been established that he will therefore be required to
        return to Iraq without this important document or access to a PDS
        card, or even if it is so, that his difficulties will impair him to
        the extent that he will not be able to engage with the Civil
        Authorities who could make reference to the Central Archive
        containing civil identity records, which will enable him to obtain
        a copy of his CSID.


    12. The country guidance case law also clearly identifies a procedure
        for obtaining the necessary travel documents with which it is
        reasonable to expect MW to cooperate. As such it has not been
        established that he faces risk on return as an undocumented failed
        asylum seeker, sufficient to engage any of the international
        protection provisions.


    13. In relation to MW's claim that the level of violence is currently
        so high in Iraq that he cannot be expected to return, and
        specifically not to Mosul, I mentioned to the advocates at the
        hearing a number of cases decided in the European Courts of Human
        Rights involving Sweden, to which I have not been referred, even
        though judgment was handed down in December 2013.


    14. In BKA v Sweden (Application no. 11161/11) ECtHR (Fifth Section)
        (December 2013), it was held that although the Applicant would face
        a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3
        of the ECHR if returned to Baghdad or Diyala, the Court found that
        he could reasonably settle in another governorate, for instance,
        the Anbar governorate, where it had not been shown that he would
        face such a risk. Neither the general situation in that governorate
        nor any of the Applicant's personal circumstances indicated the
        existence of said risk.


    15. In TA v Sweden (Application no. 48866/10) ECtHR (Fifth Section), 19
        December 2013 it was held that there was insufficient evidence to
        conclude that the Applicant would face a real risk of being
        subjected to treatment contrary to Article 2 or 3 of the ECHR upon
        return to Iraq.


    16. In TKH v Sweden (Application no. 1231/11) ECtHR (Fifth Section), 19
        December 2013 it was held that the Applicant would not face a real
        risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 2 or 3 of
        the ECHR upon return to Iraq. Moreover, his health status was not
        of such a serious nature that his deportation would give rise to a
        breach of those provisions.


    17. In relation to Mosul it is accepted that statistically this is an
        area where there has been a number of attacks and incidents of
        violence, a large number of which appear to have occurred as a
        result of their victims being targeted [Iraq Bulletin (body count)
        - page 13]. This is a case, however, in which there is no evidence
        of MW having been targeted or of adverse interest being taken in
        him in the past and the evidence does not substantiate his claim to
        be at risk as a result of being specifically targeted. A lot of his
        evidence as to the foundation of the alleged risk was found not to
        be credible.


    18. Mrs Pettersen submitted that even if the family were no longer
        living in their home there was no evidence MW could not take up
        residence and no evidence that he would be of adverse interest to
        anybody if this occurred. I find such a submission sustainable on
        the facts


    19. I accept that an individual's characteristics may be relevant to
        assessing whether they are entitled to a grant of humanitarian
        protection as the more an applicant is able to show that he or she
        is specifically affected by reason of factors particular to their
        personal circumstances, the lower the level of indiscriminate
        violence required for them to be eligible for subsidiary
        protection. Such characteristics that MW has have to be considered
        in light of the preserved findings and situation in Iraq generally,
        which I have done.  It is not disputed before me that MW could
        resume occupation of the family home but it is maintained that he
        has no contact with family members although the evidence relating
        to this is not contemporaneous with this hearing.  In any event Mr
        Worthington's submission is that he cannot be returned as a result
        of the current levels of indiscriminate violence which would make
        it very difficult for him to settle safely in that locality.


    20. Since hearing the Court of justice of the European Union (fourth
        chamber) has handed down its judgment  in the case of Aboubacar
        Diakit� v Commissaire g�n�ral aux r�fugi�s et aux apatrides, case C-
        285/12, in which the Court were asked for a preliminary ruling
        concerns the interpretation of Article 15(c) of Council Directive
        2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the
        qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless
        persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international
        protection and the content of the protection granted. It was held
        that on a proper construction of Article 15(c) of Directive
        2004/83/EC, an internal armed conflict existed, for the purposes of
        applying that provision, if a State's armed forces confronted one
        or more armed groups or if two or more armed groups confronted each
        other. It was not necessary for that conflict to be categorised as
        'armed conflict not of an international character' under
        international humanitarian law; nor was it necessary to carry out,
        in addition to an appraisal of the level of violence present in the
        territory concerned, a separate assessment of the intensity of the
        armed confrontations, the level of organisation of the armed forces
        involved or the duration of the conflict. The decision contained a
        reminder that the more the applicant is able to show that he is
        specifically affected by reason of factors particular to his
        personal circumstances the lower the level of indiscriminate
        violence required for him to be eligible for subsidiary protection.


    21. It must be borne in mind that the existence of an internal armed
        conflict can be a cause for granting subsidiary protection only
        where confrontations between a State's armed forces and one or more
        armed groups or between two or more armed groups are exceptionally
        considered to create a serious and individual threat to the life or
        person of an applicant for subsidiary protection for the purposes
        of Article 15(c) of Directive 2004/83 because the degree of
        indiscriminate violence which characterises those confrontations
        reaches such a high level that substantial grounds are shown for
        believing that a civilian, if returned to the relevant country or,
        as the case may be, to the relevant region, would - solely on
        account of his presence in the territory of that country or region
        - face a real risk of being subject to that threat (see, to that
        effect, Elgafaji, paragraph 43).


    22. I find it not to be established on the evidence that the
        confrontation between the armed forces of Iraq and the armed groups
        referred to by Mr Worthington can be exceptionally considered to
        create a serious and individual risk to MW on return as a result of
        the degree of indiscriminate violence reaching such a high level,
        leading to substantial grounds being proved to exist for believing
        that if returned MW will be subject to such a threat solely on
        account of his presence in his home area.


    23. It is noted when considering this test that the Court in the case
        of TKH v Sweden, when considering an appellant from Mosul in
        December 2013, concluded in relation to the general situation in
        Iraq and whilst international reports attested to a continued
        difficult situation, including indiscriminate and deadly attacks by
        violent groups, discrimination as well as heavy-handed treatment by
        the authorities, it appears that the overall situation has been
        slowly improving since the peak in the violence in 2007.  It was
        noted that in the case of FH v Sweden (no. 32621/06) the Court,
        which had at its disposal information and material up to and
        including 2008, concluded that the general situation in Iraq was
        not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article 3 of
        the Convention in the event of a person's return to that country.
        I have considered with care the international and national reports
        made available and relied upon by MW and, although they report an
        escalation in attacks and acts of violence within Iraq, such levels
        are still below the peak of the violence in 2007 and do not
        substantiate the claim that the situation has deteriorated to the
        extent that it is appropriate for me to depart from the position
        accepted by the European Court.


    24. As such evidence is lacking it is necessary to identify personal
        characteristics or circumstances that give rise to a "serious and
        individual threat" to the MW's "life or person" to enable him to
        succeed.  The fact MW's accommodation may have been untidy and he
        has not turned the heating on at all times in winter and acted in a
        way that others may consider to be illogical, combined with the
        assessment of his level of functioning, indicates that MW may be
        more vulnerable than others when coping with day to day routines
        and activities. I find it not substantiated, however, that the
        degree of any difficulties he has enables him to establish that
        such circumstances exist on the facts of this case. It is a
        preserved finding that MW's level of functioning is that of a 12-
        year-old child but also a preserved finding that he has a friend in
        Iraq who is in a position to offer support.  He functions in the UK
        as a result of the combination of personal ability and assistance
        and it has not been substantiated that a similar model is not
        available for him in his home area. Judge Taylor's finding in
        paragraph 43 of the determination that he has support and
        protection from his family including his father brother and his
        friend is challenged on the basis of a letter from a named
        individual who reportedly found their property to be empty.  Judge
        Taylor's determination was promulgated on 7 October 2010.   Mr
        Ilbarudi has filed a witness statement dated 20th December 2013 in
        which the following is recorded:


              4.  In 2010 I contacted a friend called Tahseen Baig and asked
   him to go               to the Appellants home area in Masaraf Province
   (which is a                      neighbouring province to my province of
   Zuhoor) and then go to a                  big traffic light in Masaraf
   and there is a mosque and an allotment.                Beside the
   allotment you walk around for five minutes and then ask
   for the Appellants father's house.  His fathers name is [WA].


              5.  After around two weeks I called Tahseen Baig to see if he
   had been to                  the Appellants home area.  He then told me
   that he had been and                  that the house was empty.  He asked
   neighbours on the same street                 about the Appellants
   family. Some of them said they do not know                  where the
   family are and some did not want to talk as they were
   afraid.  They did not know why Tahseen was enquiring and
   therefore did not want to give any information.


    25. Whilst it is understandable that people may be hesitant to disclose
        information if it is thought that terrorist group's enquire about
        people they wish to kidnap and are therefore afraid, this evidence
        is to the effect that on one occasion when a visit was made in 2010
        the appellant's family home was unoccupied . There is insufficient
        evidence of further enquiries being undertaken since 2010, through
        the Red Cross or any other available organisation, especially if
        the enquiry in 2010 preceded the hearing before Judge Taylor.  I
        note the detail of the content of the alleged communication between
        Mr Ilbarudi and Mr Baig but very imprecise details of the date when
        this alleged conversation is said to have occurred.   I find such a
        statement relating to a situation that is said to have existed in
        2010 is not determinative of the claim that the family are not able
        to provide support. Judge Taylor's finding was made on the basis of
        the evidence she was asked to consider and it appears the contents
        of the witness statement may have been produced to rebut that
        finding.


    26. I do not find it substantiated on the evidence that at the date of
        this hearing, some years later, such support as is required would
        not be available from family members or others in MW's home area.


    27. The evidence clearly indicates that MW has some degree of
        functioning but it has not been shown that if returned he is at a
        greater risk of suffering harm as a result, sufficient to entitle
        him to a grant of humanitarian protection based upon Article 15 C
        or Article 3 ECHR. Difficulties may be faced as a result of the
        lower level of functioning and his style of living that may not be
        acceptable to the majority, but this does not establish that he is
        able to cross the required threshold and does not entitle him to
        remain in the UK per se.


    28. Having given this case the most anxious scrutiny in light of the
        information that is available, it is my primary finding that MW has
        failed to discharge the burden of proof upon him to the required
        standard to prove that he is entitled to a grant of humanitarian
        protection or to any other form of international protection, on the
        evidence made available.


Decision

    29. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.




   Anonymity.


    30. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules
        2005. I make that order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
