For the Respondents:   Mr Bramble, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellants are both nationals of Zimbabwe.  They  are  husband  and
wife.  They have permission to appeal against the decision of the First-
tier Tribunal (Judge Hindson) who on  the  27th  March  2014  dismissed
their linked appeals against decisions to refuse to vary their leave to
remain, and to remove them from the United Kingdom pursuant to  s47  of
the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

The Appellants had applied for indefinite leave to remain on  the  13th
July 2013. They had both been lawfully  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
2008.  The focus of this appeal is Mr M; his wife is his dependent.  He
had initially been granted leave to enter as a Highly  Skilled  Migrant
and on the 9th April 2010 applied to vary that  leave  so  as  to  gain
further leave to remain as a Tier 1  Highly  Skilled  General  Migrant.
That application was successful and  on  the  21st  July  2010  he  was
granted a further three years leave to remain. He was in possession  of
that leave when on the 10th July  2013  he  made  his  application  for
settlement.

The application was refused by way of letter dated  the  19th  December
2013. Therein the Respondent states that when Mr M  applied  to  extend
his leave as a Highly Skilled Migrant in 2010  he  had  claimed  to  be
earning �50,386 net from his self- employment. On the  basis  of  those
earnings  the  Respondent  had  awarded  him  45  points.   During  the
consideration of the present application the Respondent  had  conducted
checks with HMRC and found that the Appellant had failed to submit  any
tax returns for the period 2008-2009, the period under consideration in
the 2010 application.  It was therefore considered that  the  Appellant
had made false representations in the course of his  2010  application,
and that meant that this application had to be refused  with  reference
to paragraph 322(2) of the Immigration Rules.

When the appeal came before the  First-tier  Tribunal  it  was  on  the
papers. Both Appellants had lodged lengthy grounds  of  appeal  dealing
with  the  allegation  of  deception,  the  merits   of   the   present
application, and Article 8.  In respect of this last matter  there  was
for instance a statement from Ms M explaining that she has  lived  here
since she was 16 years old,  has numerous family members here, that she
has been educated in this country to  Masters  level  and  has  held  a
series of executive positions including latterly with  Coco-Cola  as  a
procurement manager.  In respect of the allegation of deception,  Mr  M
agreed that he had  been  tardy  in  submitting  his  tax  returns  but
submitted that he had told the truth about his self-employed income  in
2010 and had now sent in all the returns.  Although he  blames  a  "tax
consultant" named Mr W, whom he  had  instructed  for  not  filing  the
returns, he does accept that the statement from HMRC relied upon by the
Respondent is factually correct.

The First-tier Tribunal deals with the deception issue as follows:

         "the appellant claims now he  is  taking  the  necessary  steps  to
         correct the position. He says that all of his tax returns have  now
         been submitted to the tax authorities. He  has  provided  documents
         which have been downloaded from HMRC which are not  entirely  clear
         but which do seem  to  support  his  contention  that  he  has  now
         submitted tax returns for the years 08/09, 09/10, 10/11, 11/12, and
         12/3. However the appellant has not provided me with copies of  his
         actual tax returns.


         I therefore have no evidence to support the appellant's  contention
         that he earned a  net  income  in  excess  of  �50,000  from  self-
         employment prior to making the application in 2010. Given that this
         is fundamental to the reasons for refusal, I  would  have  expected
         the appellant would have provided the evidence,  if  such  evidence
         actually exists


         Drawing all the evidence together, I make the following findings. I
         do not believe the appellant's story about the mysterious Mr  W.  I
         am satisfied that the appellant deliberately  did  not  submit  tax
         returns. This is because he was not in fact earning what he claimed
         from self-employment. I am therefore satisfied that the application
         was rightly refused under the provisions of  paragraph  322(2)  and
         consequently under paragraph 245CD(b)"

The grounds of appeal, drafted by the Appellants, argue that the First-
tier Tribunal made a number  of  factual  errors,  failed  to  consider
relevant  evidence  and  erred  in  its  approach  to   the   deception
allegation.    In particular the Appellant submits that when he elected
for his appeal to be disposed of on the papers he had presumed that all
of the relevant documents, supplied with his 2010 application, would be
provided with the Respondent's bundle. He knew that to include, amongst
other things, two separate sets of accounts signed by  members  of  the
Institute of Chartered Accountants  of  England  and  Wales.    He  had
thought that this would be sufficient to show that he had not  lied  at
all about his claimed income.

In response the Respondent maintains that the HMRC statement showing no
tax paid in respect of the Appellant's self-employment  was  sufficient
to demonstrate deception on his part.

Error of Law

The burden of proof rests on  the  Appellant  to  show  that  he  today
qualifies for settlement in the UK. The only  ground  for  denying  him
that grant of indefinite leave to remain  is  the  allegation  that  he
deceived the Home Office in 2010 when he told them that his net  income
from his business was �50,386.  The burden  of  proof  in  establishing
that deception lies on the Respondent, and the standard of proof is the
balance of probabilities. The Respondent must produce  cogent  evidence
to discharge that burden.

Before the First-tier Tribunal the only evidence  relied  upon  by  the
Respondent was a statement by HMRC which shows that although registered
for tax, the Appellant submitted no tax returns in respect of his self-
employment for the years under consideration. All that shows is that he
did not submit his tax  returns.  Whilst  that  is  in  no  way  to  be
condoned, I struggle to see how that demonstrates  that  he  was  lying
when he told the Home Office that he earned  �50,386  in  the  relevant
year.   Lots of people earn money without submitting their tax  returns
on time; they have still earned the money. It may  be  that  with  more
evidence  the  burden  could  be  discharged,  for  instance   if   the
application form  submitted  in  2010  showed  the  Appellant  to  have
asserted that he had paid the tax on time, or if the rules under  which
he applied expressly required him to have done  so.   However  none  of
that evidence  was  produced.  The  Judge  appears  to  have  given  no
consideration to the fact that the Respondent had granted leave in 2010
and must therefore have been satisfied that the Appellant  merited  his
45 points under Appendix A. This strongly suggests that  the  Appellant
must have submitted some evidence of his earnings - for instance in the
form of certified accounts and/ or bank statements.  I  find  that  the
HMRC statement was not in itself sufficient to discharge the burden  of
proof in showing deception - as opposed to late payment of  tax  -  and
for that reason the First-tier Tribunal erred in law.

This matter should be re-made  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   If  the
Respondent wishes to maintain the refusal under  paragraph  322(2)  she
will no doubt wish to adduce further evidence to support her contention
that the Appellant exercised deliberate  deception  in  2010.   If  the
Respondent fails to discharge the burden of proof  in  respect  of  the
false representations, the burden will fall to the  Appellant  to  show
that he qualifies for leave to remain.


Decisions

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and it
is set aside.

Due to the extent of judicial  fact  finding  required  the  matter  is
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.
