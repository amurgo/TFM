                            DECISION AND REASONS

       This is an appeal, by the , against the decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Anthony Metzer QC), sitting at Hendon on 3 August 2017,
    to  an appeal against deportation by a  citizen  of  Albania,  born  in
    1983. The appellant had claimed asylum shortly  after  his  arrival  in
    2006, but in 2007 absconded from the conditions of his  release.  While
    at large, he met [KC], a British citizen, and  in  2011  they  went  to
    Albania to be married. In 2012 he returned on a husband  visa,  and  in
    2014 was given indefinite leave to remain.

ERROR OF LAW

 2. However, from 16 April 2015 the appellant was involved in a  conspiracy
    to supply a kilogram of very pure cocaine, of which  he  was  convicted
    after  a  trial,  and  on  10  February  2016  sentenced  to  6  years'
    imprisonment. There was no appeal against conviction or  sentence,  and
    on 22 July notice of intention  to  deport  him  was  given.  That  was
    resisted by his solicitors on the basis of his private and family life,
    not only with [KC], but with their daughter A, born on 2 July that same
    year. An automatic deportation order followed on 29 September.

 3. While the appeal was brought on general article 8 grounds, the  crucial
    question for the judge turned on the terms of the  relevant  provision,
    applying to someone sentenced to 4 years or more in prison. It  appears
    in this form, so far as  relevant,  in  s.  117C  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and in effectively identical terms  in
    paragraphs 398, 399 and 399A of the Immigration Rules.

       (1) The deportation of foreign criminals is in the public interest.
       (2) The more serious the offence committed by  a  foreign  criminal,
          the greater is the public interest in deportation of the criminal.
       (3) In the case of  a  foreign  criminal  ("C")  who  has  not  been
          sentenced to a period of imprisonment of four years or  more,  the
          public interest requires C's deportation  unless  Exception  1  or
          Exception 2 applies.
       (4)  Exception 1 applies where-
          (a)        C has been lawfully resident in the United Kingdom  for
             most of C's life,
          (b)        C is socially and culturally integrated in  the  United
             Kingdom, and
          (c)        there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  C's
             integration into the country to  which  C  is  proposed  to  be
             deported.
       (5) Exception 2  applies  where  C  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
          relationship  with  a  qualifying  partner,  or  a   genuine   and
          subsisting parental relationship with a qualifying child, and  the
          effect of C's deportation on the partner or child would be  unduly
          harsh.
       (6)  In the case of a foreign criminal who has been sentenced  to  a
          period of imprisonment of at least four years, the public interest
          requires   deportation   unless   there   are   very    compelling
          circumstances over and above those described in Exceptions  1  and
          2.

 4. Exception 1 could have no relevance to this case,  since  each  of  the
    conditions (a) - (c) had to be satisfied for it  to  apply.  The  judge
    clearly accepted that the  appellant  had  a  'genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship' with both his wife and  their  daughter,  and  that  they
    could not reasonably be expected to go with him to Albania, because  of
    concerns about their health, and [KC]'s  mother's,  to  which  I  shall
    return. There may have been an open question, despite the  considerable
    sympathy the judge expressed for all three of  the  appellant's  family
    members, as to whether it would have been unduly harsh for them to stay
    here without him.

 5. However, the judge seems to have dealt with the case on the basis that,
    while Exception 2 might be satisfied, it  showed  no  'very  compelling
    circumstances' over and above those described in it. The  most  helpful
    recent authority on dealing with cases of this kind  is  AJ  (Zimbabwe)
    [2016] EWCA Civ 1012: while Hesham Ali (Iraq) [2016] UKSC  60  contains
    further discussion, it is less directed to the  task  in  hand,  and  I
    shall turn to it only if I need to. Although AJ  (Zimbabwe)  was  about
    two cases in which the Tribunal had allowed  a  deportation  appeal  by
    someone sentenced to less than four years'  imprisonment,  the  opening
    words of paragraph 11 make it clear  that  the  Court  of  Appeal  were
    aiming  to  give  guidance  on  what  might   amount   to   exceptional
    circumstances, though the phrase now used, both in paragraph 398 and s.
    117C (6), is 'very compelling circumstances'.

 6. The general guidance in AJ (Zimbabwe) [under paragraph 11] follows:  it
    summarizes the effect of the leading authorities  to  date,  and  so  I
    shall leave out the citations.


         (1)  The rules establish a set of  criteria  which  tribunals  must
         apply  when  assessing  the  impact  of  article  8   in   criminal
         deportation cases: ...

         (2)  The rules are a complete code. Accordingly, when applying  the
         "exceptional circumstances" criteria, the court  should  apply  the
         article 8 proportionality test: ...

         (3)  Unless the specific exceptions  apply,  the  scales  are  very
         heavily weighted in favour of deportation.  ... there must be "very
         compelling reasons" to outweigh the public interest in deportation.
         These compelling reasons constitute the "exceptional circumstances"
         referred to in rule 398: ...

         (4)  The justification for the courts giving  such  weight  to  the
         public interest in the deportation  of  foreign  criminals  is  not
         simply that the Immigration Rules do  so,  it  is  that  Parliament
         itself in section 32(5) of the UK Borders Act has  stipulated  that
         deportation should be the usual consequence of criminal  offending:
         ... "only a very strong claim indeed"  could  override  the  public
         interest.

         (5)  A consequence of the rules constituting a  comprehensive  code
         is that when exercising the residual  article  8  assessment  where
         exceptional circumstances are relied upon, the tribunal must  carry
         out the assessment "through the lens of the  new  rules"  and  that
         requires a recognition of the very considerable weight to be  given
         to the public  interest  in  deportation.  This  distinguishes  the
         foreign criminal cases from other article 8 cases,  such  as  where
         the Secretary of  State  seeks  to  remove  illegal  immigrants  in
         circumstances engaging article 8, where no  single  factor  carries
         such dominant weight and a more general balancing exercise will  be
         appropriate:  ...   Here  the  scales  tip  heavily  in  favour  of
         deportation.

         (6)  When having regard to  the  public  interest  in  deportation,
         there are  three  important  facets:  the  need  to  deter  foreign
         criminals  from  committing  serious  crimes;  an   expression   of
         society's  revulsion  at  serious  crimes   and   building   public
         confidence in the treatment of foreign criminals who have committed
         such crimes; and the risk of re-offending. It is an error to assume
         that the risk of  re-offending  is  the  sole,  or  even  the  most
         important, facet where serious crimes are committed: ...

         (7)  It is not enough for a  tribunal  in  its  reasons  simply  to
         identify a strong public interest in  the  deportation  of  foreign
         criminals; there must be a full recognition of  the  very  powerful
         weight to be given to that factor and of the  need  for  compelling
         factors to outweigh it: ...

 7. The judge's decision is very clear, where it is complete; and it  deals
    with the appellant's evidence, and his wife's in  a  way  to  which  no
    reasonable objection could be made. While the copy on  file  bears  the
    judge's electronic signature, so must have been approved  by  him,  the
    permission judge rightly said that it had arguably not been proof-read.
    The brevity he also noted is not in my view a defect,  unless  it  left
    any important point uncovered. Miss Poynor cited various authorities on
    the extent to which deficiencies in the form of the decision may amount
    to an error of law, of which all that needs to be said is that  whether
    they do or not will depend on all the relevant circumstances.

 8. I have thought hard about whether the judge's reasoning could be upheld
    on the basis  that  his  findings  of  fact  left  no  potential  'very
    compelling circumstances' unidentified. However, this is a very serious
    case, in terms of the public interest in the appellant's deportation as
    much as of its likely effect on  his  wife  and  their  daughter,  and,
    inevitably to a lesser extent, his wife's mother. It is clear from  the
    guidance in AJ (Zimbabwe) that the judge needed to start by considering
    whether the appellant's deportation was proportionate to the legitimate
    purpose of , in  terms  of  their  article  8  rights,  his  own  being
    relatively unimportant in the circumstances.

 9. While the judge made his views on the effect on  the  appellant's  wife
    and daughter of following him to  Albania,  that  gave  only  half  the
    picture. The other half was about the effect on them of having to  stay
    here without him. Despite the sympathy quite  reasonably  expressed  by
    the judge, he did not make clear whether or not, and if so why he found
    that would be proportionate. Here the gap in the judge's final sentence
    is particularly unfortunate: the typist has left a row of dots to  show
    where she was unable to hear the recording.


       In all the circumstances, having carried out the  balancing  exercise
       in accordance with Razgar and taking into account  all  the  relevant
       factors under Paragraph A398 and Section 117of the 2002 Act,  I  find
       that the disproportionate interference with the Appellant's right  to
       family life ... were he to be deported to Albania.

10. If the judge did intend to find that the interference with the  article
    8 rights of the appellant's family as  a  whole  was  disproportionate,
    then he needed to explain why, even so, his findings on  that  did  not
    make for  'very  compelling  circumstances'  showing  that  the  public
    interest did not require his deportation. In my view, that was an error
    of law, in what has become a difficult field, which  requires  a  fresh
    hearing.

11. I raised the question at the error of law hearing  as  to  whether  the
    case should remain  before  me  or  be  sent  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Miss Poyner argued that I was bound  to  send  it  back,  for
    reasons which seemed to me wholly misconceived. There was no difficulty
    about any credibility findings, no suggestion that the judge  gave  any
    appearance of bias,  and  no  possible  argument  that  the  first-tier
    hearing had been a nullity.

12.  It  followed  that  the  case  remained  before  me;  but,  given  its
    importance, both to the public and  to  the  appellant's  family  as  a
    whole, I need to reach my own assessment of those concerned.  For  that
    reason only, I made it clear  I  should  be  prepared  to  consider  it
    afresh, on the basis of oral evidence both from the  appellant,  to  be
    produced, and his wife.

EVIDENCE

13. On 15 January the appellant and his wife [KC] (who I hope will  forgive
    me for calling  her  by  her  Christian  name  for  short)  gave  their
    evidence, first  confirming  the  statements  they  had  given  to  his
    solicitors. They explained that they  had  met  in  2007,  and  started
    living together in 2009 or 2010:  in  2011  they  were  engaged  to  be
    married. The appellant had told [KC] about his immigration status,  and
    in August that year he had returned to Albania to get his marriage visa
    in the proper way: [KC] came out for their wedding, which was  a  civil
    one, on 2 September: they had a large party for his family a couple  of
    days later. [KC], who is a nurse, had to come back to  work  here,  but
    the appellant stayed on, preparing for his English-language test.

14. In November 2011 the appellant  applied  for  his  visa,  on  which  he
    returned to this country in January 2012. Meanwhile [KC]  came  to  see
    him a couple of times  more  after  their  wedding.  Also  during  this
    period, the appellant planned to start a business in Tirana,  but  most
    unfortunately became the victim of a fraud, which left  him  owing  the
    equivalent of �17,000 to a friend called [E], who may or may  not  have
    been involved in it himself. He did not tell [KC] about this, so as not
    to worry her. He had also spent a good deal of money on  his  visa  and
    flights.

15. Back in this country, the appellant worked first in car-washes, then as
    an electrician's mate for as long as  the  work  lasted,  and  then  on
    building sites. [E] came here from time  to  time,  and  the  appellant
    offered to repay him in instalments; but [E] would  not  take  it  that
    way. [KC] was still working, and she and the appellant were  saving  up
    for a house together. On 5 October 2013 they had a  big  wedding  party
    for friends and family in this country, and  went  on  their  honeymoon
    after to the Canaries.

16. In 2014 the appellant took a lease on a car-wash business for �1,500  a
    month, and ran it with casual workers to help. In January 2015  he  and
    [KC] bought their house in Luton, under  the  government  Help  to  Buy
    scheme, and started trying for a baby. However in  late  2014  [E]  had
    started putting him under pressure to repay the loan in full.  By  this
    time the appellant had  saved  �10,000  from  his  business,  which  he
    offered [E] as an instalment; but [E] still wanted  all  the  money  at
    once. However as an alternative he offered the appellant the chance  of
    doing some work for him, which he accepted.

17. [E] gave the appellant a mobile phone, which he was to  use  for  calls
    about the work, which the appellant said he thought must  be  something
    like debt collection. However the only time he was  called  on  was  to
    pick up an Albanian in Bedford and take him to a place he would be told
    about. The Albanian followed him to the place by  taxi,  and  then  got
    into his car; but then the police stopped them, and found drugs on  the
    other man. The appellant was also arrested  and  interviewed,  when  he
    denied all knowledge of the drugs, and then released on bail.

18. At the appellant's first trial, the jury could not agree;  but  on  the
    retrial he was  convicted  and  sentenced  on  11  February  2016.  The
    sentencing judge described what he and his co-defendant had done as "an
    isolated involvement in very serious crime". The co-defendant was given
    credit for his plea, so got four years; but the appellant received six,
    with an order for forfeiture of  �10,250.  He  said  in  oral  evidence
    before me that he had made this money by legitimate work for cash;  but
    he had been unable to show this, and so the order was made.

19. The appellant said this sentence had come as  a  complete  surprise  to
    him, despite having been advised by his solicitors that he  could  have
    got as much as eight years' imprisonment. He says he had no  idea  that
    drugs were involved in what he was asked to do, and would  have  walked
    away if he had realized. If he were ever at risk of being  involved  in
    anything like this again, he would ask his wife and  family  for  help,
    and if necessary the police.

20. At this point it needs to be said that I have to take my view  of  what
    happened from the jury's verdict, as well as  the  sentencing  remarks.
    The appellant was convicted of  conspiracy  to  supply  cocaine,  which
    involved an agreement between him and his co-defendant to do just that;
    and the second jury must have been sure about it. While I  am  prepared
    to accept that the appellant may have owed �17,000 to [E], and  had  no
    more than �10,250 in his possession, he must have been well aware  that
    he was becoming involved in something seriously illegal. There  was  no
    doubt temptation to act as he did; but this was not a  situation  where
    there was no alternative. I have been  provided  with  a  copy  of  his
    criminal counsel's clearly correct  advice  against  appeal  on  either
    conviction or sentence.

21. Going on to the appellant's present situation, he and  [KC]  found  out
    she was expecting A in the week of his first trial in October 2015, and
    she says he  was  very  supportive  till  he  was  taken  into  custody
    following his sentence the following February. [KC] gave birth to A  on
    2 July 2016: her mother took her into hospital, and her sister and best
    friend were present during the birth. The delivery was straightforward;
    but she says she was heartbroken not to have the appellant  there  with
    her. [KC] has been able to take A to see the appellant every week,  and
    they have been allowed to use the prison play-room  together.  He  also
    sends her recordings of himself reading stories, so  that  she  can  at
    least hear his voice.

22. The main worry about A has been her medical condition: her p�diatrician
    wrote on 18 November 2017 to say  she  had  what  was  described  as  a
    perineal vaginal mucosal prolapse. Though an ultrasound scan had  shown
    nothing abnormal internally, she was referred for "a precautionary Uro-
    Gynae review", for which she has an appointment at Great Ormond  St  on
    24 January. The p�diatrician describes her as a "thriving well  child";
    but she has a possible liver abnormality, on  which  the  result  of  a
    blood test is awaited.

23. [KC] herself had a ligament replaced in her knee  in  2006,  and  on  8
    December 2017, after  having  some  pain,  especially  going  upstairs,
    underwent the first stage of a procedure designed to replace the  graft
    and carry out a bone graft to  her  tibial  tunnel.  She  is  presently
    signed off work, and due to receive physiotherapy, but managed to  come
    to court on 15 January, clearly very much distressed by the  situation:
    she has been through counselling, which was completed in October. On 29
    January she is to see her surgeon about further work on her  knee,  and
    may also need a small operation to remove a cyst above her  right  eye:
    she was to see an ophthalmologist on 17 January about that.

24. [KC]'s father died some time ago, and she, her  sister  [E]  and  their
    mother have all been very close. Their mother was diagnosed with throat
    and breast cancer  in  December  2016/January  2017,  and  underwent  a
    lumpectomy. When she signed her statement in July 2017 she had finished
    chemotherapy, and was waiting  to  start  radiotherapy:  she  was  also
    waiting for an exploratory operation on her throat. She says both  [KC]
    and [E] (also a nurse, but  living  further  away  from  her  at  Hemel
    Hempstead, in Oxford) have given her constant support over  the  course
    of her treatment.

25. Cross-examined, [KC] accepted that  she  had  visited  Albania  several
    times, and, if she could afford it, could do  so  again  to  visit  the
    appellant, if he were deported; but she said that, separated from  him,
    she and A were "... not a true family ...", and she  was  under  stress
    from dealing with A's condition (besides her own  problems).  Presently
    her mother is her main helper, and comes to  stay  overnight  and  look
    after A, when [KC] is able and needs to work. [E] helps too, but  lives
    further away.

26. Besides [E] and their mother, a number of  other  people  made  witness
    statements on the appellant's behalf. One was his brother [A],  who  is
    married and living in this country: he  has  taken  over  his  car-wash
    business, renting a room in Luton to stay in while he  runs  it,  since
    the appellant has been in custody. [A] relates how the  appellant  gave
    him the version of events rejected by the  jury:  he  hadn't  told  him
    either about the debt to [E] till after he was arrested.  [A]  suggests
    that, if the appellant were deported and  [KC]  stayed  here,  "...  it
    would destroy his young family"; but if he were released, then he could
    go back to running his business, and [A] could stay with  his  wife  in
    Kent.

27. [KC]'s aunt [CE], and her friend  [HD],  have  both  given  statements,
    saying that the appellant has not only been a hard worker  for  himself
    and his family, but happy to help them  or  others  out  whenever  they
    needed it. Both speak obviously sincerely of the dire  consequences  of
    the appellant's being deported, and [KC] needing to stay here  with  A.
    Another 26 friends and relations, mostly British citizens, have written
    less formal, but equally sincere letters of support.

28. The appellant himself has been following every course he could while in
    prison, and most recently has been working for the DHL warehouse there,
    who describe him as "... a very good worker and  his  ethic  is  really
    good, he is always prepared to help with what  is  required".  However,
    the most significant evidence in his favour comes at the end of  [KC]'s
    recent statement (9 January 2018):

       "I am really struggling without my  husband  by  my  side  especially
       given my recent surgery and my daughter's health problems. I need  my
       husband to support me as well. He is the father of  my  daughter  and
       she also needs her Daddy in her life. We are going through a  lot  of
       difficulties at the moment and my husband  is  irreplaceable  in  our
       lives."

CONCLUSIONS

29.  Looking  first  at  the  relevant  'public   interest   considerations
    applicable in all cases' under s. 117B of the Nationality,  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002, there is nothing against the appellant on  (2)  or
    (3), since he speaks good English, and could  clearly  support  himself
    and help [KC] support A, if free to do so. So far as their married life
    is concerned, they established it in the proper way, by applying for  a
    marriage visa from Albania,  following  which  the  appellant  received
    indefinite leave to remain, shortly before he committed his  crime;  so
    the other potentially relevant  sub-sections  do  not  go  against  him
    either.

30. Turning to the  additional  considerations  under  s.  117C,  there  is
    clearly a strong public interest in the deportation  of  someone  found
    guilty of an offence described by the  sentencing  judge  as  even  "an
    isolated involvement in very serious crime". All I need add is that the
    importance of the purity of the kilo of cocaine involved lies not  just
    in the fact that it would go further when sold on the  street;  but  in
    its being presumably closer to the source  of  supply.  Importers  need
    couriers to do their business, and that was  the  side  this  appellant
    took part in. Exception 1 does not apply in this case, as the appellant
    has not been here for most of his life; but Exception 2 might do.

31. On the criteria in Exception 2, [KC] is a qualifying partner, and  A  a
    qualifying child: clearly the appellant has a 'genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship' with [KC]. While there is authority that some element  of
    help and support is required for a  'genuine  and  subsisting  parental
    relationship' with a child, the appellant sees A  regularly,  and  does
    his best to be a father to her, subject to the limitations  imposed  by
    his imprisonment. In my view they do have such a relationship.

32. The next question is whether the effect of the appellant's  deportation
    would be unduly harsh,  either  on  [KC]  or  on  A.  It  is  now  well
    established that 'unduly' involves consideration of what is due to  the
    public interest. Clearly [KC] is not to blame  for  what  he  did,  and
    obviously A is not either. I agree with the  judge  that,  in  view  of
    their  medical  conditions,  and  [KC]'s  mother's,  they   could   not
    reasonably be expected to follow the appellant to Albania.  That  means
    the effect of his deportation has  to  be  judged  in  terms  of  their
    physical separation from him.

33. Of course nowadays [KC] and A could keep in touch with the appellant by
    electronic means, including calls on Skype or  a  similar  service,  in
    which A could begin to take her part. However, this would of course not
    be the same as having the day-to-day love and support of a  father  and
    husband living with them. Both [KC] and A are lucky to have the support
    of close family and friends: [KC]'s mother, living close, has been able
    to stay over and look after A if [KC] has to work nights, though during
    the day she goes to a nursery.

34. The other side of that is the question-mark on [KC]'s mother's  health:
    there is nothing in the up-to-date evidence to show that her cancer has
    returned, or what was the result of the exploratory  operation  on  her
    throat. However, she speaks in glowing terms of the  support  [KC]  has
    been able to give her, with the advantage of her professional training.



35. Clearly [KC]'s own physical health has given difficulties,  by  way  of
    the restrictions on her movements and ability to work while her knee is
    under repair. While A is described as 'a  thriving  well  child',  very
    much to  her  mother's  credit,  and  the  forthcoming  review  of  her
    condition at Great Ormond St as  'precautionary',  there  remains  some
    question-mark over her condition too.

36. It is plain that  the  appellant's  deportation  would  mean  that  the
    difficulties that [KC] has had in looking  after  A,  herself  and  her
    mother while he has been in prison would be prolonged for as long as he
    remained excluded from this country, and without the moral  support  of
    being able to see, talk and interact with him face-to-face  on  visits.
    Assuming that exclusion lasted for the minimum ten years, it  would  go
    on for all of A's earlier childhood.

37. The effect of that on A would certainly be harsh, though she has  never
    known what it is to have a living-in father, and children are generally
    well capable of adapting to the state of affairs in which they grow up.
    It would be even harsher on [KC], since she would  bear  the  brunt  of
    coping with the family's difficulties,  though  not  without  help  and
    support from her mother, so long as her health allows,  and  from  [E],
    bearing in mind the distance.

38. However I have to decide whether those effects would be  unduly  harsh,
    bearing in mind  the  crime  of  which  the  appellant  was  convicted.
    Exception 2, for obvious reasons, says nothing  about  the  effects  on
    him, though I am sure he would suffer too. He has done the best he  can
    for himself since he was sent to prison, working  hard  and  getting  a
    good report for it. For the reasons given at 20, I  cannot  accept  his
    own version of his involvement, and it is not in  his  favour  that  he
    continues effectively to dispute the verdict of the jury.  However,  in
    the end the public interest comes down to  the  need  to  deter  anyone
    likely to be tempted to commit even an isolated very serious offence of
    this kind.

39. It is hard to decide the question  involved  in  Exception  2,  without
    having at the back of my mind the  distinction  under  sub-section  (6)
    between those sentenced to terms of at least four  years'  imprisonment
    and others; but, taking all the relevant facts into  account,  while  I
    have no doubt that the effects of the appellant's deportation  on  [KC]
    and on A would be harsh, I also take the view that they  would  not  be
    unduly harsh, in terms of the public interest involved.

40. If I were wrong about that, I should certainly have  no  doubt  at  all
    that the effects of the appellant's deportation, on [KC] and on A,  did
    not amount to 'very  compelling  circumstances  over  and  above  those
    described in Exceptions 1 and 2'. Innocent wives and children are  made
    to  suffer,  even  where  there  is  no  immigration  element,  by  the
    imprisonment  of  their  husbands  or  fathers  for  crimes  they  have
    committed. While imprisonment will usually come to an end a  good  deal
    sooner than the period of exclusion following deportation, and does not
    involve the same difficulties in  visits,  a  criminal's  liability  to
    removal is something for him to consider, in his family's interests  as
    much as his own, and in the end the responsibility must be his.

Decision re-made: appeal dismissed
