Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr M Nadeem, Legal Representative, City Law
Immigration


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS


1.    The  appellant  (hereafter  the  Secretary  of  State  or  SSHD)   has
    permission to challenge the decision of First-tier Tribunal (FtT) Judge
    M Davies sent on 19 January 2017 allowing her appeal against a decision
    made by the SSHD on 26 April 2016 refusing leave to remain in the UK on
    compassionate grounds outside the Immigration Rules.  The claimant is a
    citizen of India, aged 73, who last came to the UK on  a  family  visit
    visa in September 2015.  She did not leave within the permitted  period
    of stay but submitted an application for leave to remain on 26  January
    2016.

2.   The SSHD's grounds  of  appeal  were  essentially  threefold.   It  was
    submitted that the judge erred in law (1) in failing  to  consider  the
    claimant's circumstances through the lens of the Immigration Rules; (2)
    when assessing the  claimant's  Article  8  circumstances  outside  the
    Rules,  in  failing  to  take  into  account  any  of   the   statutory
    considerations contained in ss.117A-D of the  NIAA  2002;  and  (3)  in
    wrongly allowing the appeal on the basis that "the [SSHD]  should  have
    exercised his discretion outside the Immigration  Rules  to  allow  the
    [claimant leave to remain]".

3.   The submissions I heard from  both  representatives  were  concise  and
    proficient.  Mr Tufan pointed out a further  ground  of  concern  which
    although not strictly an aspect of grounds 1-3 does identify a relevant
    feature of the judge's decision-making and  which  for  this  reason  I
    shall call ground 4.  This alleges that the judge improperly failed  to
    permit the Home Office representative to cross-examine the claimant.

4.   It is convenient to address grounds (3)  and  (4)  first  of  all.   In
    relation to ground 3, I find it is fully made out as it is  clear  from
    the terms of ss.82-86 NIAA 2002 that the judge had no  jurisdiction  to
    allow the appeal in respect of a failure on the part  of  the  SSHD  to
    exercise discretion outside the Rules.  However, as the author  of  the
    grounds and Mr Tufan conceded, this error was not material as the judge
    also allowed the appeal on human rights grounds in respect of which  he
    did have jurisdiction.

5.   In relation to ground 4, I see force in Mr Tufan's  argument  that  the
    judge did not approach application of the Joint  Presidential  Guidance
    on Vulnerable Witnesses with sufficient vigour.   At  paras  18-19  the
    judge wrote:

         "18. I noted that the Appellant Vimiaben Patel  of  [             ]
             was pushed into court by one of her daughters in a wheelchair.
              From my observations it was clear she was in  a  particularly
             frail condition and I noted her  exceptionally  small  stature
             and lack of weight.  Undoubtedly her condition had come  about
             not only due to her age but as a result of the  fall  she  had
             suffered in the United Kingdom resulting in her being confined
             to a wheelchair.  The  evidence  supported  by  the  Appellant
             confirmed that situation.


         19.  In the process of identifying  her  she  became  exceptionally
             distressed and I therefore indicated  to  the  representatives
             that I would treat her as a vulnerable witness  and  it  would
             seem totally inappropriate and perhaps impossible for  her  to
             be cross-examined.  Helpfully Miss Chaudhry accepted that that
             was the case.  Miss Chaudhry indicated she would like  to  ask
             the other witnesses a few questions but  I  suggested  to  her
             bearing in mind the Appellant was  a  vulnerable  witness  the
             appeal and the evidence should be heard in  her  presence  and
             that any questioning of her  two  daughters  would  cause  her
             further considerable stress.   On  that  basis  Miss  Chaudhry
             agreed that I should proceed by simply receiving submissions."

6.   The difficulty with the judge's treatment of  this  issue  is  that  it
    appeared to consider the mere fact that a witness was to be treated  as
    a vulnerable witness as entailing that they were to be  excused  having
    to give oral testimony.  The judge had no medical evidence stating that
    the claimant was unable to give oral testimony and it is far from clear
    that he could not have considered expecting her to give  oral  evidence
    subject to a sensitive approach being taken to  her  initial  state  of
    distress.  At the same time the fact of the matter is that although the
    Home Office Presenting Officer requested permission to ask the claimant
    "a few questions" (even after the judge had said he did not want her to
    have to give evidence), she did not press this further when  the  judge
    again stated he considered this would be  inappropriate;  nor  did  the
    SSHD raise the matter in the written grounds.

7.   I turn then to grounds 1 and 2.

8.   I have had regard to the relevant provisions of Appendix FM set out  in
    the sections dealing with R-LTRP and D-LTRP as well as paras A277C  and
    276ADE. The SSHD had regard to these provisions.  In the course of  her
    considerations the SSHD also took account of the  claimant's  essential
    reason for seeking to stay, namely her health problems, including those
    caused or exacerbated by her fall in the UK on 26 September 2015.   The
    SSHD then turned to consider whether these  circumstances  justified  a
    grant of leave outside the Rules on Article 3  or  8  grounds.   It  is
    salient to set out the relevant parts of her human rights assessment as
    set out at pp.4-5 of the refusal letter:

         "You have provided  representations  dated  16/1/2016  and  medical
         evidence from India dated 23/1/2008 and 26/10/2015  in  support  of
         your claim with regard to your  health  problems  which  originated
         during your life in India for which you claim to  require  constant
         medication.  However, it is acknowledged that treatment for all  of
         these medical condition(s) is available  in  India.   Indeed,  your
         evidence from Doctor Mayur  M  Shah  dated  26/10/2015  gives  full
         details of your medical treatment which you have been receiving for
         the past 5  years.   This  treatment  would  appear  to  have  been
         successful in maintaining your health as you have been  fit  enough
         to travel to the United Kingdom on at least 3 occasions (30/7/2011,
         11/6/2012, 27/8/2014) prior to your  latest  arrival  and  also  to
         travel to Australia on 9/2/2015.  Whilst, it is accepted  that  the
         health care systems in the U.K. and in India  are  unlikely  to  be
         equivalent, this does not, in itself, entitled you to remain  here.
         The fact that your circumstances would be less favourable in  India
         than they are in the U.K is also not decisive  from  the  point  of
         view of Article 3.  The United Kingdom is not  obliged  to  provide
         you with medical treatment, which may or  may  not  be  lacking  in
         India.  However, objective and factual evidence, you have provided,
         suggests that there is appropriate help  which  you  could  access,
         should the need arise.


         You have also made mention in your  representations  that  you  are
         suffering from reduced mobility following  a  fall  in  the  United
         Kingdom on 26/9/2015 and that  you  would  now  have  trouble  with
         everyday tasks and maintaining yourself in the event of your return
         to  India.   However,  it  is  noted  from  your  Entry   Clearance
         application dated 17/8/2015 that you  have  stated  that  you  have
         funds amounting to �2000.  It is  also  noted  that  your  daughter
         claims to earn around �1600 per month and you have provided Western
         Union receipts showing that your sponsor has previously sent  funds
         to you in India by transfer.  Consequently,  it  is  believed  that
         this arrangement could continue on your return  to  India  and  you
         could continue to receive support from your  United  Kingdom  based
         family.  It is believed that your level of income would enable  you
         to obtain medical services and also access a level of care in India
         as and when required.  This care could be arranged by your  UK  and
         Australia based family and enable you to have  appropriate  day  to
         day help with everyday tasks, as and when required.  Therefore,  it
         is considered that your issues  with  reduced  mobility,  difficult
         though they may be for  you,  do  not,  in  themselves,  make  your
         circumstances exceptional and would not enable  you  to  reach  the
         threshold to allow you  to  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  under
         Article 3 medical.


         It has also been considered whether  the  particular  circumstances
         set out in your application  constitute  exceptional  circumstances
         which, consistent with the right to respect for private and  family
         life contained in Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
         Rights, might warrant a grant of leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom outside the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules.   Your
         relationships with your family and your private life in the  United
         Kingdom have been dealt with above.  Whilst it is acknowledged that
         you may face difficulties on  your  return  to  India,  it  is  not
         believed  that  those  difficulties  amount  to   exceptional   and
         insurmountable circumstances.  You have 2 daughters in  the  United
         Kingdom and a daughter in Australia.  Whilst they may not  be  able
         to support or care for you on a day to day basis due to  their  own
         commitments, it is considered that a care package could be arranged
         or carried out by them to see that you get a similar level of  care
         to that which you receive in this country.  This care package could
         be financed by your UK based relatives providing financial  support
         via Western Union, in the same manner as happened  previously  when
         you were residing in India.  Your UK  and  Australia  based  family
         would also have the option to visit you in India on a regular basis
         in order to maintain contact.  It has therefore been  decided  that
         there   are   no   exceptional   or   compellingly    compassionate
         circumstances in your case.  Consequently your application does not
         fall for a grant of leave outside the rules."

9.   Bearing in mind that the Immigration Rules have been  held  to  reflect
    the  SSHD's  understanding  of  the  public  interest  and  that   that
    understanding must inevitably inform the assessment  of  whether  there
    are compelling circumstances warranting a grant of leave on  Article  8
    outside the Rules, it was incumbent on the FtT  judge  to  address  the
    SSHD's assessment both under the Rules and outside the Rules.   Instead
    the judge's only direct treatment of the  Rules  was  confined  to  the
    observation at para 24 that:

         "[It] has not been argued in this appeal  that  the  Appellant  can
         meet the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules  as  a  dependent
         relative because of  course  it  is  accepted  that  the  Appellant
         entered the UK as a visitor".


     Thereby the judge  completely  ignored  the  respondent's  reasons  for
    considering the claimant did not meet the requirements of Appendix  FM.
    In addition, the judge's  treatment  of  the  claimant's  circumstances
    outside the Rules was confined to the following paras:

         "26. In my view the Respondent did not give proper consideration to
             granting the Appellant leave to remain outside the Immigration
             Rules on a discretionary basis.  He  had  been  provided  with
             evidence as to the Appellant's condition  and  the  suggestion
             she should  be  returned  to  India  by  herself  to  make  an
             application for entry clearance from there seems to ignore the
             Appellant's predicament.  How the Appellant  was  expected  to
             make an application for entry clearance from India without the
             assistance of her family has not been explained.  She may have
             been able  to  afford  medical  care  whilst  making  such  an
             application to require her to  do  so  appears  to  me  to  be
             totally unreasonable.


         27.  I also make it clear that  the  evidence  that  has  been  put
             before me indicates that the Respondent's decision does amount
             to an interference with the Appellant's right to  respect  for
             her family life.  The evidence that is put before  me  clearly
             indicates there is a situation  of  total  dependence  by  the
             Appellant  upon  her  daughters.   That  dependence  is   both
             physical and emotional and I cannot imagine any  circumstances
             in which the Appellant could be returned  to  India  in  those
             circumstances.  To return her in all probability  taking  into
             account her physical and mental state of health would probably
             lead to her demise.


         28.  On the basis of my findings above I find that the interference
             caused by the Respondent's decision would have consequences of
             such gravity as to potentially engage the operation of Article
             8.  Whilst the interference would be in  accordance  with  the
             law and may be necessary for one of the  reasons  set  out  in
             Article  8  it  would  in  no  way  be  proportionate  to  the
             legitimate  end  of,  for  instance,   maintaining   effective
             immigration control."

10.  There are a number of difficulties with  these  paragraphs.   First  of
    all there is no indication whatsoever that the  judge  weighed  in  the
    Article 8  proportionality  assessment  any  public  interest  factors.
    There was just the simple assertion that the decision "would in no  way
    be proportionate".

11.  Second, the judge appeared to simply assume from his finding  that  the
    claimant was totally dependent on her daughters in  the  UK  that  this
    automatically precluded the possibility that she  could  be  adequately
    cared for in India where she had  been  able  to  receive  satisfactory
    medical treatment for five years previously and where, on the  strength
    of the evidence as to how she had lived in India prior  to  her  visit,
    family arrangements for her to receive care in India might be made.   A
    troubling backdrop to the judge's assessment is that not  only  did  he
    decide somewhat prematurely not to allow  the  claimant  to  give  oral
    testimony; he did not consider receiving oral testimony  from  the  two
    daughters.  He seemed prepared to take the  claimant's  and  witnesses'
    assessment of her health circumstances at its highest even  though  the
    SSHD in her refusal letter plainly did  not  consider  it  sufficiently
    serious to prevent her from returning to India.  It cannot be said that
    the medical evidence before the judge obviously demonstrated  that  her
    health  circumstances   met   the   high   threshold   established   by
    jurisprudence on either Article 3 or Article 8.   I  am  not  concerned
    here to indicate one way or the other whether on a  properly  conducted
    proportionality assessment the claimant could  succeed;  only  to  note
    that the judge's attempted proportionality  assessment  was  singularly
    flawed since it effectively just adopted the claimant's account without
    any attempt at testing even by way of hearing from the two daughters.

12.  Turning to ground (2), the  point  made  above  regarding  the  judge's
    failure to show that he weighed public interest factors in the  balance
    in fact applies not just to his disregard  for  the  Immigration  Rules
    dimension to that public interest, but also to those he was statutorily
    required to take into account by virtue of  s.117B  of  the  2002  Act.
    There is nothing to suggest that he weighed against her the  fact  that
    she was  not  financially  independent,  or  that  she  lacked  English
    language capability.  Mr Nadeem makes the fair point that the latter is
    not a requirement imposed under the Rules for persons over 65,  but  no
    such limitation is specified under s.117B and it was still incumbent on
    the judge to explain why it was not a consideration to which he  should
    attach any significant weight.  Finally, the  judge  nowhere  shows  he
    attached negative weight to the s.117B consideration of her  precarious
    immigration  status.   It  was  certainly  relevant  to  assessment  of
    precisely  how  much  weight  he  should  attach  to   her   precarious
    immigration status  that  he  was  satisfied  that  it  was  never  her
    intention to overstay her visit and that she only did so because of her
    fall; but that did not negate the need for him  to  show  that  he  had
    reduced the weight that he could attach to her immigration conduct.

13.  In short,  the  judge's  proportionality  assessment  was  vitiated  by
    significant legal errors capable of having a  material  effect  on  the
    outcome of the appeal.  For the above reasons I set aside his decision.

14.  In the circumstances this case falls squarely within the  criteria  set
    out in the Senior President's Practice Statement concerning remittal to
    the First-tier Tribunal.

15.  In view of the SSHD's observations on the FtT's  judge's  treatment  of
    the issue of whether the claimant as a vulnerable witness should not be
    required to give oral  evidence,  I  direct  that  her  representatives
    provide written clarification of whether they intend to call her  as  a
    witness or, if not (because they consider that inappropriate),  provide
    up-to-date medical evidence to  support  that  view.   Irrespective  of
    whether medical evidence is produced sufficient for the FtT to conclude
    that she is unfit to give evidence, her two daughters are  directed  to
    attend ready to give oral evidence.

No anonymity direction is made.
