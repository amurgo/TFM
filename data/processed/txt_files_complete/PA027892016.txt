For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms S Jegarajah, counsel instructed by MTC  Co,
Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. I shall refer to the appellant as the secretary of state and to RA  as
      "the claimant." The claimant is a national of Sri Lanka, born on  [  ]
      1991.


   2. The appeal before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  J.  C.  Hamilton  on  16
      August 2016,  proceeded on the basis that there  were  two  appellants
      before him, namely,  RA  and   TJRB.  However,  the  latter  had  been
      referred to as 'other dependent' (sic) in  the  secretary  of  state's
      decision dated 9 March 2016,  in  which  she  refused  the  claimant's
      application for asylum. No separate application was made by TJRB,  nor
      was there a separate decision made with regard to  TJRB.  Although  RA
      and TJRB were cited and dealt with as first and second 'appellants' by
      the first Tier Tribunal Judge, there was no separate decision  against
      which TJRB could appeal.


   3. The secretary of state appeals against the decision of the  First-tier
      Tribunal allowing the appeals of both the claimant and  her  dependant
      under the Refugee Convention. A fee award was made in respect of  each
      "appellant".


   4. The claimant asserted that she feared persecution  on  return  to  Sri
      Lanka on the basis that she was in a same sex  relationship  with  her
      partner, TJRB. They are both nationals of Sri Lanka. They  married  in
      the UK on 20 January 2016.


   5. The claimant came to the UK on a student visa in March 2012. Her leave
      was extended until 14 August 2014. Her application made on  13  August
      2014 for further leave to remain as a student was refused.


   6. On 12 March 2015 she was served with an IS 151A form as an overstayer.
      On 9 September 2015 she applied for asylum on the basis that  she  was
      in a same sex relationship with her partner and  that  they  would  be
      persecuted in Sri Lanka on account of their sexual orientation if they
      had to return there.


   7. The secretary of state accepted the claimant's  identity,  nationality
      and sexual orientation. It  was  not  accepted  that  her  family  had
      threatened to kill her when they discovered  her  sexual  orientation.
      She claimed that her parents stopped her from  attending  school  when
      they discovered her  sexual  orientation  and  her  relationship  with
      another female pupil referred to as "A". The claimant claimed that she
      was arrested when the police discovered her relationship with  A.  She
      was not charged with any offences  despite  the  fact  that  same  sex
      relationships  are  illegal  in  Sri  Lanka.  That  inconsistency  was
      asserted to have undermined the reliability of her account.


   8. The secretary of state contended that even if she were at risk in  her
      local area, she was educated and had  extensive  work  experience  and
      would be able to live and work in a different area of Sri  Lanka  such
      as Kandy. She had shown her ability to live independently in the UK.


   9. The First-tier  Judge  had  regard  to  the  evidence,  including  the
      documentary evidence that was provided. Evidence was also given by her
      partner, TJRB.


  10. In his discussion and  findings,  Judge  Hamilton  did  not  find  the
      criticisms of her account in the decision  letter  and  those  put  in
      cross examination to be sufficiently cogent to undermine the fact that
      she was able to maintain a consistent account over time.  He  did  not
      find it "incredible" that she would be  arrested  and  abused  by  the
      police as claimed[1].


  11. He found that her account was  also  consistent  with  the  background
      evidence relating to the mistreatment of LGBT individuals in Sri Lanka
      and the routine abuse of power perpetrated by security forces and  the
      police. Her account was also  consistent  with  the  medical  evidence
      produced.  He took into account her apparent lack of lack of knowledge
      or interest in the LGBT community in Sri Lanka. Given  her  age,  that
      was not considered to be a significant inconsistency - [64].


  12. He considered the circumstances including her account  of  psychiatric
      assessment.


  13. He accepted her account of being detained and seriously abused by  the
      police. He also accepted that her family was now hostile  towards  her
      [67]. In that respect he stated that "the threats  they  are  said  to
      have made may well be hyperbole but the underlying fact is  that  they
      are unlikely to support or accept her if she lives openly as a lesbian
      in Sri Lanka." There was no sufficiently cogent  evidence  to  suggest
      that she had fabricated her account.


  14. The Judge referred to paragraph 339K of the Rules. The fact  that  she
      had been arrested and mistreated on one occasion  did  not  mean  that
      were she to return to Sri Lanka she would be at any greater risk  than
      any other young gay woman [69].


  15. He had regard at [70] to the secretary of state's assertion  that  the
      claimant and her partner would be able to live in Sri Lanka as a  same
      sex couple without being at any real risk of mistreatment.


  16. He referred to the claimant's assertion that female same  sex  couples
      could not live openly and safely in Sri Lanka. It had been conceded on
      behalf of the claimant that the Upper Tribunal in LH and IP held  that
      while homosexual men in Sri Lanka did constitute a  particular  social
      group they are not in general at risk of persecution.


  17. However, it was contended that this finding was  not  applicable  when
      considering the claimant's case as the decision did  not  specifically
      address the issue of lesbians in Sri Lanka nor whether it was possible
      to live openly as a homosexual in Sri Lanka given that the decision in
      LH and IP accepted at paragraph 112, that  LGBT  individuals  were  at
      risk of being arbitrarily  arrested,  detained  and  harassed  by  the
      police and that when this happened they would not  be  able  to  avail
      themselves of state protection - [72].


  18. Moreover, the 2015 guidance showed that the situation had now  changed
      and the LGBT community in Sri Lanka  did  now  face  a  real  risk  of
      persecution. The Judge had regard  to  paragraph  4.1.1  of  the  2015
      Guidance  to  the  effect  that  in   recent   years,   human   rights
      organisations reported that '......police harassed and extorted  money
      or sexual favours from LGBT individuals with  impunity  and  assaulted
      gay men and lesbians in Colombo and other areas'.


  19. It was argued that this finding was not  applicable  when  considering
      the claimant's case for reasons set out at [72]. He identified various
      other paragraphs relating to LGBT at paragraph [72](3)(b) to (k).


  20. It was contended before Judge Hamilton at [73] that the information in
      the 2015 guidance amounted to credible new evidence showing  that  the
      situation had changed to such an extent that pursuant to the  Practice
      Direction, it was permissible to depart from country  guidance  in  LH
      and IP.


  21. He referred to an unreported decision of Deputy Upper  Tribunal  Judge
      Saini  in  SASS  vSSHD  (AA/07983/2015,  highlighting  the  difference
      between the 2013 US State Department report that was before the  Upper
      Tribunal in LH and IP and the 2014 US  State  Department  report  that
      formed the basis of much of the  information  contained  in  the  2015
      guidance.


  22. Judge Hamilton referred at [75] to that decision where the more up-to-
      date information in the 2015 guidance  and  the  US  State  Department
      report showed that  ".......the  authorities,  having  demonstrated  a
      worrying high percentage of violent and other  criminal  acts  against
      gay men due to their sexual orientation, confirmed by two  independent
      sources and relied upon by the respondent in her own [Guidance]".


  23. Judge Hamilton  stated  at  [77],  that  even  if  not  bound  by  the
      unreported decision of Judge Saini, he agreed with his  reasoning  and
      analysis.


  24. He noted at [78]  that  the  secretary  of  state  accepted  that  the
      claimant and her partner are living in the UK as an  openly  same  sex
      couple. It is therefore likely that they would wish  to  live  in  Sri
      Lanka in the same way. On the evidence before him it was  likely  that
      the only reason that they would not do so would be because  they  were
      frightened about reprisals - [78].


  25. From those findings, he concluded that the claimant  and  her  partner
      have shown that they are at risk of persecution  in  Sri  Lanka.  They
      would want to live openly  as  a  same  sex  couple  and  the  current
      background evidence showed  that  there  would  be  a  clear  risk  of
      significant mistreatment if they did this - [79].


  26. He did not find the fact that both claimed to have  been  disowned  by
      their families or the fact that  the  claimant  had  suffered  serious
      mistreatment at the hands of  the  authorities  adds  any  significant
      weight to their claim. These facts are consistent  with  the  attitude
      towards homosexuals reported in the background evidence [79].


  27. On 12 December 2016, First-tier Tribunal Judge  Grimmett  granted  the
      secretary of state permission to appeal. It had  been  contended  that
      there was a fundamental misunderstanding of the secretary  of  state's
      position made by the Judge in concluding that the secretary  of  state
      had accepted that the claimant and her partner were living openly in a
      same sex relationship in the UK  when  the  secretary  of  state  only
      accepted that the claimant is a lesbian. The reasons for  refusal  did
      not accept the openness of  the  relationship  and  it  was  therefore
      arguable that there was an error on the part of the Judge.


The appeal


  28. Mr Clarke noted that in the claimant's  partner's  decision,  she  was
      advised that as a dependant she did not have a right of  appeal.  That
      was only of practical relevance as the claimant made her asylum  claim
      with the partner as a dependant on her claim.


  29. He accepted that this was "of only practical relevance".


  30. Her partner was also notified that she did not have to  leave  the  UK
      during the period in which the claimant can appeal.  If  there  is  an
      appeal she did not need to leave the UK.


  31. He submitted that the Tribunal did not set out any other  reasons  for
      refusal letter save for the decision in respect of  the  claimant.  On
      that basis he  has  erred  in  treating  the  dependant  as  a  second
      appellant.


  32. Mr Clarke submitted that the secretary of state had  accepted  in  the
      reasons for refusal the claimant's  identity,  nationality,  ethnicity
      and sexuality. However, contrary to that limited concession, the Judge
      in his discussion and findings at [78]  stated that 'as he  understood
      it', the secretary of state accepts that the claimant is living in the
      UK in an openly same sex couple.


  33. However, such a concession is not contained in the reasons for refusal
      which is limited to sexual orientation.  He referred to the  "material
      facts consideration" in the reasons for refusal at paragraph 23.  With
      regard to "sexual orientation", the secretary of state noted that  the
      claimant claimed to be a lesbian. She was asked a number of  questions
      relating to her claim that she is a lesbian. Her answers given  during
      an interview are set out. In the light of those questions posed to her
      during her interview, the secretary of state considered that  she  was
      able  to  give  an  internally  consistent   account   regarding   her
      realisation of her sexual identity.


  34. The secretary of  state  also  referred  to  her  claim  that  she  is
      currently in a relationship with the dependant on her claim.  She  was
      able to give a coherent and internally  consistent  account  regarding
      her relationship with her dependant. In addition she had  stated  that
      she has married her in the UK and submitted a  certified  copy  of  an
      entry of marriage from the London Borough of  Croydon.  The  secretary
      stated: It was therefore accepted that "you are a lesbian."


  35. Further, the Judge noted from the oral evidence at  [50-51]  that  the
      claimant's friends in the UK currently support her  and  were  unaware
      that she was in a relationship with her partner, the dependant to  the
      appeal, let alone  that  she  and  her  dependant  were  married.  The
      claimant had no involvement with the LGBT community in the UK.


  36.  He  accordingly  submitted  that  the  First-tier  Judge   erred   in
      misunderstanding the nature of the secretary of state's  position  and
      in particular, whether the claimant would be discreet in her sexuality
      on return to Sri Lanka. He submitted that there were no reasons  given
      "driving that discretion" without which any assessment is incomplete.


  37. He also relied on the secretary of  state's  grounds  that  the  Judge
      erred  by failing  to  make  a  finding  whether  there  was  'cogent'
      evidence to depart form the 'extant CG'. Whilst it is correct that the
      country guidance looking at the issue of gay men in Sri Lanka does not
      specifically address  the  position  of  lesbians,  "the  headnote  is
      intuitive". There it was stated that there is a significant population
      of  homosexuals  "and  other  LGBT  individuals"  in  Sri  Lanka,   in
      particular in Colombo. Whilst there  is  more  risk  for  lesbian  and
      bisexual women in rural areas, because of  the  control  exercised  by
      families on unmarried women, and for transgender individuals  and  sex
      workers in the cities, it would be a question of fact  whether  for  a
      particular individual the risk reaches  the  international  protection
      standard, and in particular, whether  it  extends  beyond  their  home
      area.


  38. He submitted that the claimant was from Colombo, which is not a  rural
      area.  She  had  managed  to  live  without  any  problems  from   the
      authorities in Kandy [35] and on the findings of the Judge  would  not
      have to worry about her family's involvement, having categorised their
      threats as potentially "hyperbole" [67].  The  Judge  had  accordingly
      erred in failing to make a proper finding in that respect.


  39. Mr Clarke referred to the 2015 guidance set out by the Judge  to  show
      how the situation had changed and that the LGBT community in Sri Lanka
      did now face  a  real  risk  of  persecution.  The  guidance  was  not
      sufficient to trump the country guidance case. It was  not  sufficient
      to show that there would be a risk per se for  the  claimant.  In  any
      event, that case dealt with the position of a gay  man  who  had  been
      threatened by family. There  had  been  a  clear  distinction  in  the
      country guidance case between urban and rural  areas.  Given  that  no
      concession had been made as to how they would live, it  was  vital  to
      look at how they would be identifiable. The risk category  is  related
      to a public profile.


  40. He submitted that the decision should be set aside and re-made on  the
      basis that the country guidance case is still good law  and  that  the
      profile of the claimant would not put her in any risk category.  There
      was no evidence to show that there would be risk in  a  city  such  as
      Kandy.


  41. On behalf of the claimant, Ms Jegarajah submitted that it is wrong for
      the secretary of state to submit that the  decision  of  Judge  Saini,
      which had not been appealed, should not have been considered.


  42. Moreover, there had been no  challenge  to  the  positive  credibility
      findings at [67] regarding the  claimant's  assertions  including  her
      claims of detention and abuse. The Judge considered  the  evidence  in
      detail before setting out his conclusions from paragraph [57]. He took
      into account that the secretary of state had  not  accepted  that  the
      appellant had been arrested and raped by the police in Sri  Lanka.  It
      had also not been accepted that her family had rejected  her  and  had
      posed a risk as she claimed.


  43. He found that the "criticisms" of her account in the  decision  letter
      which were put to her  in  cross  examination  were  not  sufficiently
      cogent to  undermine  the  fact  that  she  was  able  to  maintain  a
      consistent account over time - [61].


  44. He also took  into  account  their  apparent  lack  of  knowledge  and
      interest  in  the  LGBT  community  in  Sri  Lanka.  That  was  not  a
      significant inconsistency given their ages  when  they  lived  in  Sri
      Lanka, and their particular circumstances.


  45. He noted that the claimant had effectively given her account  on  four
      separate occasions. Whilst agreeing that there  are  potentially  some
      implausible and possibly  inconsistent  aspects  to  her  account,  he
      appropriately directed himself as to how he should assess her actions.
      He considered whether  her  ability  to  remain  consistent  might  be
      because she is an accomplished liar and intelligent enough to stick to
      a carefully researched, fabricated account. However,  he  applied  the
      lower standard of proof and did not find that the suggestion that  she
      had  fabricated  her  account  was  cogent  enough  to  undermine  her
      credibility - [66].


  46. Accordingly Ms Jegarajah submitted  that  there  had  been  overall  a
      positive assessment which had not been challenged by the secretary  of
      state.


  47. She also submitted that what made this appeal unique is the fact  that
      they married in the UK. In LH and IP the country guidance  noted  with
      respect to gay men in civil relationships that in Sri Lanka  this  did
      not constitute a particular  social  group  for  the  purpose  of  the
      Refugee Convention. The Sri Lankan authorities' failure  to  recognise
      alternative  marital  and  quasi-marital  statuses   such   as   civil
      partnerships or  same  sex  marriage  which  are  available  in  other
      countries of the world does not, without more, amount  to  a  flagrant
      breach of core human rights.


  48. Here, however, they have got married.  In  those  circumstances  there
      would be a risk of self  identification  if  they  were  asked  in  an
      official context whether they are married. This therefore  gives  rise
      to a risk of their identification as a gay couple.


  49. The Judge also properly noted  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  any
      official record made of the claimant's detention or her homosexuality.
      In the circumstances, he found it unlikely that the authorities  would
      have done this. Given that she has been arrested and mistreated on one
      occasion did not mean that were she to return to Sri Lanka  she  would
      be at any greater risk than  any  other  young  woman  of  her  sexual
      orientation.


  50. Ms Jegarajah  submitted that in 2015 the guidance  was  official  Home
      Office policy. Accordingly, the secretary of state's current assertion
      with regard to SASS is misconceived.


  51. In  reply,  Mr  Clarke  submitted  that  the  reasoning  in  SASS  was
      inadequate. Nor is it particularly helpful to the  claimant.  In  SASS
      the appellant had been outed through his  family  and  the  community;
      accordingly, the second question in HJ (Iran), namely, if  a  gay  man
      lived openly, would he be liable to persecution in  his  own  country,
      has been answered in the affirmative owing to the background evidence.


  52. SASS was moreover  fact  specific.  There  the  appellant  would  live
      openly. The appellant gave  credible  evidence  and  stated  early  at
      interview in that case that he would not go back to living in  secrecy
      any more. Accordingly, the question of discreetness  was  answered  in
      the appellant's favour in that case.


      Assessment


  53. The First-tier Tribunal Judge  stated  that  in  this  appeal,  "as  I
      understand it" the secretary of state accepted that the appellants are
      living in the UK as an  openly  same  sex  couple.  He  found  in  the
      circumstances that it was likely that they would wish to live  in  Sri
      Lanka as an openly same sex couple.


  54. In the reasons for refusal, which dealt with "sexual  orientation"  of
      the claimant, it was accepted that she was a lesbian. It was  accepted
      that she was in a current relationship with her dependant - paragraphs
      23-24.


  55. The secretary of state also noted at paragraph 42  that  the  claimant
      wished to live openly with her partner 'as a lesbian'.  The  secretary
      of state did not however assert  in her reasons for refusal that  they
      would not want to live openly in Sri Lanka on return.  She stated that
      they would be allowed to live openly in  cities  such  as  Colombo  or
      Kandy.


  56. In her grounds of appeal before the First-tier Tribunal  the  claimant
      relied  on  the  secretary's  2015  Guidance  which   confirmed   that
      homosexuals were victimised by their families [23].  She was  a  Tamil
      which led the authorities to scrutinise her;  as a result  her  sexual
      orientation came to light and this contributed to her arrest.  It  was
      also asserted by the claimant that they would not be able to  live  an
      independent life in Sri Lanka. They would be discriminated against  in
      the  workplace  and  would  be  excluded  by  landlords   from   their
      properties.  The  decision  in  LH  and  IP  was  thus  not   directly
      applicable.


  57. The Judge found it likely that they would wish to live in Sri Lanka as
      an openly same sex couple. He concluded that on  the  evidence  before
      him, it was likely that the only reason that they would  not  do  this
      would be because they were frightened about reprisals.


  58. In her decision the secretary of state noted that the claimant claimed
      to be in a relationship with her  dependent  partner.   She  has  been
      asked questions about how they met  and  how  they  entered  into  the
      relationship with each other - Questions  109-123.  The  secretary  of
      state accepted that she was able to give  a  coherent  and  internally
      consistent account regarding their relationship. In addition  she  had
      produced evidence of their marriage.


  59. The secretary of state did not at any stage contend that they had  not
      lived openly in the UK.


  60. When considering the risk  on  return  however,  she  noted  that  the
      claimant 'claimed that she and her partner wish to live  openly  as  a
      lesbian'. However, it was considered in line with  the  case  law  and
      background evidence - which included the CIG of  September  2015  that
      there are able to live openly as a lesbians in cities such as  Colombo
      and Kandy.


  61. I have also considered the evidence given by the claimant  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal. In her asylum interview she was asked  at  Q  124
      how she had been expressing her sexuality in the UK. She replied  that
      they can go wherever they want and be free. They can hold each other's
      hands or when they are on the  train  they  have  kissed  each  other.
      Society in the UK is free.


  62. In her witness statement she stated (paragraph 23) with regard to  the
      Equal Ground investigation that LGBTIQ individuals are  denied  access
      to health services,  education  and  employment  and  the  ability  to
      participate  in social and public life - UN 3 April  2008,  para  12).
      Members lose their jobs and are kicked out of  their  homes  and  have
      difficulty accessing healthcare, housing education and justice - Equal
      Ground 7 December 2011.


  63. She contended that it was thus implausible to assume  that  a  lesbian
      couple would be able to maintain their relationship and continue their
      lives without harassment or interference.


  64. It was also expressly asserted in the  skeleton  argument  before  the
      First-tier Tribunal that if returned to Sri Lanka they would  wish  to
      live openly as a lesbian couple. Any decision not to do  so  would  be
      founded on  their  fear  of  persecution  rather  than  mere  societal
      disapproval.


  65. In her evidence, her partner stated that their friends, whom they  met
      in the UK, were helping them. If they went to Sri Lanka, she  did  not
      think that her friends there would support them if they found out that
      they were in a relationship and married.


  66. The secretary of state was  represented  at  the  hearing  before  the
      tribunal.  It is not contended that the evidence as  to  their  living
      openly in the  UK  was  challenged.    I  have  had  regard  to  Judge
      Hamilton's record of the submissions  before  him.    The  submissions
      related to her claim of having been  arrested  and  detained   in  Sri
      Lanka.  There was reliance on the  country  guidance  authority.   The
      Judge was referred by the claimant's counsel to the skeleton  argument
      that was produced and relied on before the Tribunal. In  the  skeleton
      there was specific reference to  her  replies  at  interview,  namely,
      Questions 124 and 133 to which I have referred.


  67. I find from the evidence as a whole that  was  before  Judge  Hamilton
      that he did not err by concluding that the secretary of state accepted
      that the claimants had been living in the UK as  an  openly  same  sex
      couple.


  68. Further, there was a proper evidential basis for his findings at  [78]
      and [79] that it is likely that they would wish to live in  Sri  Lanka
      as an openly same sex couple. On the evidence before him he found that
      the only reason they would not do this  would  be  because  they  were
      frightened about reprisals.  They would thus be at risk  because  they
      want to live as a same sex couple and the current background  evidence
      shows that there would be a clear risk of significant mistreatment  if
      they did this [79].


      Notice of Decision


      The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making  of
      a material error of law and shall accordingly stand.


      For reasons already given  however  the  dependant  TJRB  was  wrongly
      awarded a  fee of �140.  An award in the sum of �140 is payable to the
      claimant alone.


      Anonymity direction


      I make an anonymity direction. This direction is to  remain  in  place
      unless and until this Tribunal or any other appropriate court, directs
      otherwise. As such, no report of these proceedings shall  directly  or
      indirectly  identify  the  claimant  or  any  member  of  her  family,
      including TJRB. Failure to comply with this direction could amount  to
      a contempt of Court.

in detention in Sri Lanka. She had been in a same sex  relationship  in  Sri
Lanka which the authorities found out. After her arrest  and  detention  she
