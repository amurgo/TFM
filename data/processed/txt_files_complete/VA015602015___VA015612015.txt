                            DECISION AND REASONS

    Introduction



    1. The claimants are citizens of Iraq. The first claimant was  born  on
       1st July 1939 and the second claimant on 1st  July  1957.  They  are
       husband and wife. They wish to come to the UK to visit their  family
       in the UK including the sponsor their son, Mr Shwan Zulal, who is  a
       British citizen residing in the UK. Their  application  was  refused
       under paragraph 41 of the Immigration Rules on  27th  January  2015.
       Their  appeal  against  the  decisions  was  allowed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Seifert in a determination promulgated  on  the  10th
       October 2016 on human rights grounds.

    2. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  Kebede  on
       16th March 2017 on the basis that it was arguable  that  the  First-
       tier judge had erred in law in failing to give any reasons  why  the
       relationship between the  claimants  and  the  sponsor  went  beyond
       normal emotional ties and thus that there  was  an  Article  8  ECHR
       family  life  relationship.  It   was   also   arguable   that   the
       proportionality assessment was inadequate.

    3. The matter came  before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law.

Submissions - Error of Law

    4. The grounds of appeal contend in summary as follows.

    5. Firstly, that according to the relevant case law  that  family  life
       will only exist between adults when  there  is  a  dependency  which
       amounts to more than normal emotional ties,  and  that  findings  on
       this basis must be reasoned and supported with appropriate evidence.
       In this case the First-tier Tribunal has failed to refer to relevant
       evidence in support of the contended close relationship,  and  there
       was no evidence the sponsor had paid for the claimants' trip or made
       substantial deposits in their banks account.

    6. It was also not properly found  that  the  refusal  amounted  to  an
       interference with any family life relationship as  the  sponsor  and
       claimants could meet in a third country, and in any case the sponsor
       had gone to northern Iraq in March 2015.

    7. Further the decision on proportionality is also not lawful as  there
       is no consideration of whether due to the worsening of the  security
       situation the claimants might  not  return  to  Iraq  despite  their
       having gone back in 2013, and given  that  a  visit  only  allows  a
       temporary period in which the claimants and sponsor can be together.
       There was also a failure to  have  a  proper  consideration  of  the
       factors in s.117B of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002.

    8. Mr Zulal, sponsor for the claimants, argued that the decision of the
       First-tier Tribunal was just and correct given the  claimants',  and
       their UK relatives', commitment to retaining  close  bonds  and  the
       unrealistic nature of meeting elsewhere.

    9. I informed the parties that I  was  satisfied  that  the  First-tier
       Tribunal had erred in law for the reasons set out  below  and  would
       therefore set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal. We then
       proceeded to the remaking hearing.





Conclusions - Error of Law

   10. I find that the First-tier Tribunal has erred in law for failing  to
       provide a sufficiency of reasoning on all  points  of  the  relevant
       Article  8  ECHR  definition  in  the   decision:   namely   whether
       sufficiently strong  family/private  life  ties  exist  between  the
       claimants and UK relatives to engage Article 8 ECHR; whether refusal
       of entry clearance amounts to an interference with those  Article  8
       ECHR  rights;  and  particularly  whether   any   interference   was
       proportionate. In relation to the final matter at  paragraph  35  of
       the decision no reasoning is provided at all as to why the claimants
       could meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules at paragraph 41
       or to any other relevant matters going to proportionality, and there
       is no analysis relevant to matters under s.117B of the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Evidence and Submissions - Remaking

   11. The sponsor, Mr Shwan Zulal, is a British citizen born in  Sulaimani
       on 27th June 1976. He gave, in summary, the  following  evidence  in
       written submissions and oral evidence to the Upper Tribunal.

   12. He is a management consultant working in the oil industry, and has a
       company called Carduchi. He has a UK law degree, and he and his wife
       own their own home in Twickenham as well  as  two  other  properties
       which they rent. Mr Zulal lives in the UK with his  British  citizen
       wife, Ms Gemma Anthony, and  their  two  British  citizen  children,
       Daniel Anthony Zulal (who  is  8  years  old)  and  Georgia  Antonia
       Anthony (who is 6 years old). He is the son of the claimants.

   13. The claimants also have other family in the UK namely  another  son,
       Mr Kawan Wahbi who is also a British citizen,  and  who  is  married
       with one child born in 2015. Mr Wahbi works in the  city  of  London
       for Cisco.  Also in the UK are the first claimant's two sisters.

   14. The claimants have visited the UK for the following visits:  October
       - December 2013 (just second claimant), December 2012 to March 2013,
       December 2010 to March 2011, June 2006 to November  2006  and  April
       2003 to July 2003. Mr Zulal  gave  evidence  that  they  would  have
       visited every year if they had been  able  to  obtain  the  relevant
       visas. They had missed the births and birthdays of grandchildren and
       this pains the claimants greatly as they would wish  to  be  present
       for such occasions and in any case on a  regular  basis.  The  first
       claimant could not attend his son (Mr Wahbi's) wedding due to denial
       of a visa. It costs them about �3000 to obtain visas for every visit
       because they have to travel to obtain visas to Jordon or Lebanon  on
       two occasions per visa, and spend money not just on flights but also
       on accommodation and local agents. That they are prepared  to  spend
       this type of money shows the level of the family bond. The claimants
       and UK family are very committed in maintaining close bonds  between
       them. These ties are  not  based  on  financial  dependency  as  the
       claimants are wealthy people (see below), and are not based on  ill-
       health as all family members are  healthy.  They  are  simply  about
       emotional ties and a commitment  to  maintaining  a  close  extended
       family, which is seen amongst other things as in the best  interests
       of the children.

   15. Apart from visits Mr Zulal and his family have  three  times  weekly
       Skype sessions with the claimants. For Mr Zulal  the  commitment  to
       maintaining a close extended family is all the more important as his
       wife's father is dead and his  mother-in-law  has  severe  dementia,
       lives  in  a  care  home  and  cannot  therefore  have   an   active
       grandparental role for his children. He finds  it  tragic  when  his
       children  ask  him  why  they  cannot  see  the   claimants,   their
       grandparents, and he can provide no good reason.

   16. Mr Zulal explained that it is not possible for the claimants and his
       UK based family (his brother and his family  and  the  two  paternal
       aunts) to meet in another  country  because  they  cannot  take  the
       children to Iraqi Kurdistan due to security problems as  it  is  not
       safe enough given the threat of ISIS terrorism, and  the  fact  that
       flights are often cancelled meaning it is not possible to be sure to
       be back in the UK for school term time and  other  commitments.  The
       Foreign Office warn  against  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraqi
       Kurdistan. He and his wife are also not happy to take  the  children
       to other countries with security problems but more  favourable  visa
       systems to Iraqis such as the claimants, such as Lebanon. He and his
       wife also do not want to take the family to  Turkey  (a  country  to
       which the claimants have travelled  before)  because  of  the  anti-
       Kurdish position of present government and Kurdish and ISIS  related
       terror incidents in that country. It would be very difficult for the
       claimants to get visas to Schengen countries now: the claimants were
       able to travel to Germany in the past as part of a trade  delegation
       but have never been issued with ordinary tourist visas. Mr Zulal did
       not think the claimants would succeed in getting Schengen  visas  in
       the future. In any case, it made no sense for the nine UK  relatives
       to go to some other country where they had  no  ties  for  a  family
       visit when the two claimants had time and money to travel to the  UK
       and enjoy a visit and share their homes in this country.

   17. Mr Zulal explained that the claimant's shop in Sulaimani is just  an
       asset and not currently a functioning business. The joint income  of
       the claimants  is  around  �2956  per  month,  which  is  clearly  a
       substantial amount even in the UK, and contrasts with �300  a  month
       for a teacher in Iraqi Kurdistan. This money comes from rent and his
       father's pension. The claimants had provided documentary evidence of
       their property ownership (valued in the region  of  �1,000,000)  and
       the rents charged and of his father's pension. It was  correct  that
       the money in the bank (some �24,000) was put in to that account  for
       the sole purpose of showing the existence of these funds.  This  was
       due to the insecurity of banks in Iraq and the risk of  money  being
       stolen whilst in banks, which meant that  funds  were  not  kept  in
       them. He said that the claimants were wealthy people in  their  home
       country, and it was also significant to the  fact  that  they  would
       have incentive  to  return  that  they  could  not  liquidate  their
       property assets as due to  the  security  threat  of  ISIS  and  low
       current oil prices it was not at all easy to currently sell property
       in Iraqi Kurdistan.

   18. Mr Zulal said that aside from money and property  in  Sulaimani  his
       parents had a  number of other very  good  reasons  why  they  would
       return there. The security issues aside it is a good place to  live.
       They have a nice place to live on a small farm outside of  the  city
       where they grow their own fruit and vegetables. They have help  from
       a refugee family from Mosul whom they provide with a small house and
       some money for work on the land and to provide any  other  necessary
       help. They have friends and relatives in Sulaimani which include the
       first claimant's brothers  and  the  second  claimants  brother  and
       sisters, with a total of six siblings for both who live nearby.  The
       claimants also belong to social clubs. The first  claimant  is  also
       very determined  that  he  wants  to  die  where  he  was  born,  in
       Sulaimani. The claimants could have decided to come and live in  the
       UK twenty years ago but that is simply not what they want to do.  It
       was accepted that the claimants  were  genuine  visitors  who  would
       return and had sufficient funds for their visit  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal  in  2010,  and  there  were  no  significant  changes   in
       circumstances which made that conclusion incorrect today.

   19. In relation to English language ability the  first  claimant  speaks
       reasonable English as he taught English in primary school,  and  the
       second claimant has just a little English. His children do not speak
       Kurdish so this is the claimants'  language  of  communication  with
       their grandchildren.

   20. Mr Zulal  said  that  he  would  be  providing  the  claimants  with
       accommodation and food whilst they were in  the  UK  but  that  they
       would pay all of their other expenses from their own recourses.

   21. Mr Norton relied upon the refusal notices, and said that the  appeal
       should be dismissed.  These notices state that there is no  evidence
       that the electrical shop is currently  a  going  concern;  that  the
       claimants only have a joint income  from  rents  of  properties  and
       pension of �2965; that the bank statement evidence is  deficient  as
       there was no translation and it does not show  the  origins  of  the
       funds. The entry clearance  officer  therefore  concluded  that  the
       claimants  had  not  demonstrated   their   economic   circumstances
       sufficiently and so the Secretary of State could  not  be  satisfied
       that they were genuine visitors seeking entry to the UK for a period
       up to six  months  and  that  they  could  accommodate  and  support
       themselves  adequately  without  recourse  to  public   funds.   The
       applications were therefore refused  under  paragraph  41(i),  (ii),
       (vi) and (vii)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The  entry  clearance
       manager's review adds that there was no evidence of a breach of  any
       family life relationship in the refusal of the application,  and  in
       particular argues that in any  case  the  claimants  and  sponsoring
       family could meet via a visit in a third country or by  the  sponsor
       and family going to Iraq.

Conclusions - Remaking

   22. I first make it plain that I found Mr Zulal  an  impressive  witness
       who I unhesitatingly find told the truth. He answered all  questions
       put to him directly, carefully and fully, and supported his  answers
       with documentary evidence. His evidence was clearly heart felt,  and
       his motivation for pursuing this matter the best  interests  of  his
       young children and love for his wider family. It was also  the  view
       of Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  K.F.  Walters  who  heard  the
       previous visit visa appeal in relation to the claimants in 2010 that
       Mr Zulal was an "impressive and credible" witness.

   23.  The  relationships  between  the  claimants  and  their  UK  family
       (primarily their  two  sons,  their  wives  and  their  three  young
       grandchildren) must be the first  focus  of  this  decision.  Unless
       Article 8 ECHR is engaged at all then there  can  be  no  appeal  as
       there is only jurisdiction for the Tribunal to  hear  an  appeal  on
       human rights grounds, as is very  clearly  stated  in  Adjei  (visit
       visas - Article 8) [2015] UKUT 261. As cited  in  that  case  it  is
       anticipated that relatively few claimants will be able  to  show  an
       engagement of Article 8 ECHR in the context of a  visit  application
       to UK based relatives, and the indication  is  that  only  in  cases
       where a family life relationship meeting the Kugathas v  IAT  [2003]
       EWCA Civ 31 test of showing "more than the normal emotional ties" is
       it likely that Article 8 ECHR is engaged at all.

   24. It is however clear from the subsequent  case  decided  by  a  panel
       which included the President of the Tribunal, Mr Justice  McCloskey,
       Abbasi and another (visits - bereavement - Article  8)  [2015]  UKUT
       463, that it is not just in  scenarios  where  such  a  family  life
       relationship is shown that Article 8 ECHR may be engaged in a  visit
       appeal. In the case of Abbasi the right to respect under  Article  8
       ECHR for a short visit to the UK for collective family mourning of a
       relative who was buried in this country was recognised by the  Upper
       Tribunal, and the examination of the  preceding  European  Court  of
       Human Rights Article 8 case law on the issue shows that  this  right
       was not defined as specifically part of  the  claimants'  family  or
       private life.

   25. In this case it is clear that the claimants are not  financially  or
       physically dependent on their UK relatives. They are wealthy elderly
       people with no serious  health  problems  who  continue  to  lead  a
       fulfilled and active life with siblings, friends, clubs and  purpose
       in their home country. The question of whether there are  more  than
       "normal" emotional ties between the claimants  and  their  UK  based
       sons and their families so as to make a finding of  family  life  in
       the European Court of Human Rights sense is difficult to  answer  as
       it is hard to know what should be the  measure  of  normal  in  this
       factual scenario. The emotional ties are, I find,  on  the  evidence
       before me of Mr Zulal, very close. They speak and see each other  on
       Skype three times a week. The claimants and their sponsors  want  to
       be physically together regularly, and not  just  for  family  events
       such as marriages, births, and children's birthdays. They have shown
       that they are prepared to invest significant funds, time and  effort
       into achieving this as Mr Zulal's evidence about the  processes  for
       obtaining visas sets out. Mr Zulal clearly is committed to the  idea
       of his children having involved  grandparents  in  their  lives;  he
       clearly believes this to be in their best interests; and  is  pained
       by  his  inability  to  arrange  the  claimants'  visit   which   is
       particularly vital to his children given the  sad  health  situation
       his mother-in-law finds herself in. There is a commitment  to  close
       extended family ties within this family which is not perhaps  shared
       by the majority in an age more comfortable with  such  strong  bonds
       being limited to the nuclear  family,  but  which  is  not  entirely
       unusual either.

   26. Ultimately I do not find that it matters whether the relationship  I
       find to exist  between  the  claimants  and  their  UK  sponsors  is
       characterised  as  a  family  life  one  or  simply  an   intensive,
       significant and central part of the claimants  and  their  sponsors'
       private lives, as ultimately I find it is of very great  significant
       to all of their  identities  as  human  beings,  and  thus  must  be
       accorded respect under Article 8 ECHR. I draw some support for  this
       approach by what is said by the Court of Appeal in Singh  &  Anor  v
       SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 630 at paragraph 25 : "However, the  debate  as
       to whether an applicant has  or  has  not  a  family  life  for  the
       purposes of Article 8 is liable to be  arid  and  academic.  In  the
       present case, in agreement with Sullivan LJ's comment when  refusing
       permission to appeal, the issue is indeed academic, and clearly  so.
       As the European Court of Human  Rights  pointed  out  in  AA,  in  a
       judgment which I have found most helpful, the factors to be examined
       in order to  assess  proportionality  are  the  same  regardless  of
       whether family or private life is engaged."

   27. As I have identified that there are very significant Article 8  ECHR
       relationships engaged on the facts of this case I must  move  on  to
       consider whether there is an interference with  those  relationships
       or whether it would be reasonably possible  for  the  face  to  face
       meetings aspect of these relationships in this  extended  family  to
       take place elsewhere.

   28. I conclude on the  facts  of  this  case  that  this  would  not  be
       possible. It would be possible for Mr Zulal, if  he  were  a  single
       man, to have  his  face  to  face  contact  with  the  claimants  by
       travelling to Iraqi Kurdistan as he has done in the past,  and  thus
       if this were the factual matrix there would be no interference  with
       the Article 8 ECHR rights set out. However, this is not the  factual
       matrix: there is not just Mr Zulal but also his  British  born  wife
       and their two  young  British  citizen  children,  and  his  British
       citizen brother, his British citizen wife and  their  young  British
       citizen child. The Foreign and Commonwealth  Travel  Advice  remains
       that all but essential travel is advised against  to  Sulaimani  and
       Iraqi Kurdistan in general. It is noted that there is a high risk of
       terrorism including kidnapping across Iraq, medical  facilities  are
       limited, that flight disruption may occur, and that  there  is  only
       limited consular assistance available. It is not reasonably possible
       in these circumstances for these two young  families  to  travel  to
       stay with the claimants in their home in Sulaimani. I agree with  Mr
       Zulal that the other countries to which the claimants would be  able
       to obtain visas present with similar security problems as set out in
       his evidence; and that places without such prevalent security issues
       are highly probably to be equally unwilling to issue  visas  to  the
       claimants to enter their borders as  the  British  authorities  have
       been.

   29. The final question that I must answer is  whether  the  interference
       with Article 8  ECHR  rights  by  refusal  of  visit  visas  to  the
       claimants is proportionate to the legitimate aim. In answering  this
       question I must consider whether the claimants are able to meet  the
       requirements of the Immigration Rules. The Secretary  of  State  has
       contended that they cannot do so. There is  some  agreement  on  the
       facts as regards the claimants'  financial  situation  however:  the
       entry clearance officer accepts that  the  claimants  have  a  joint
       income of �2956 a month and they  appear  to  accept  that  this  is
       supported by rental agreements  and  a  pension  document  from  the
       Ministry of Finance and Economy for the first claimant sourcing this
       income.

   30. The claimants accept that  their  money  cannot  be  traced  in  its
       origins by payment via banks as contended  by  the  entry  clearance
       officer, but point to evidence (in the form  of  a  Reuters  article
       entitled "Banks say current accounts  have  ben  inaccessible  since
       2014" dated 4th December 2015) of  the  problems  which  mean  Iraqi
       Kurds do not use banks. The article recounts  the  fact  that  since
       2014 the Iraqi Kurdistan government has seized billions  of  dollars
       in deposits at two branches of Iraq's central  bank.  The  claimants
       have now provided translations of the  bank  statements  from  Ashty
       Bank for both claimants showing a total of  �24,000.  The  claimants
       accept that the electrical shop is  currently  dormant  and  not  of
       central relevance, beyond being an asset, to the claimants, although
       both claimants remained members  of  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  and
       Industry at the point of decision.

   31. Having examined all the  documentation  provided  by  the  claimants
       pertaining to the date of decision, and heard from  the  sponsor  Mr
       Zulal, I am satisfied on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
       claimants joint monthly income at that time was  in  the  region  of
       �2900 and that this income was derived  from  rental  income  and  a
       pension; that they had access to cash in the region of �24,000 in  a
       bank account; and that they owned property worth in  the  region  of
       950,000 (as supported by the property documents and translations  in
       the claimant's bundle). I am satisfied that  this  level  of  wealth
       means that the claimants were more than able to pay for their travel
       to and from the UK and support themselves for the  period  of  their
       visit at the time of decision. I am satisfied that they  would  have
       been provided with adequate accommodation by Mr Zulal and his  wife,
       and that they are owners of the property in Twickenham as a property
       deed regarding this has been provided.

   32. I am also satisfied that the claimants would have returned to  Iraqi
       Kurdistan at the end of their proposed three month  visit  and  were
       genuine visitors. At the time of decisions  the  claimants  had  the
       very considerable financial and property assets set out  above,  but
       in addition they also had family, friends, a settled life with their
       own source of fruit and vegetables and paid help as needed in  their
       homestead, social club membership and a strong desire  to  live  and
       die in their home country. I also note that they had  both  returned
       from visits to the UK on four previous occasions, and in the case of
       the second claimant on a further occasions when she visited  the  UK
       alone.  I am satisfied that they would therefore have returned  home
       at the end of their visit and abided  by  the  conditions  of  their
       leave to enter during their visit.

   33.  I note also that my conclusion on this issue is the  same  as  that
       reached by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal K  F  Walters  in  March
       2010, although clearly my assessment  is  based  on  the  facts  and
       evidence before me, and these have altered over the four plus  years
       between this decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  the  decisions
       to refuse the claimants entry clearance which  are  the  subject  of
       this appeal.

   34. I now consider issues  arising  under  s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 in the context  of  my  decision  on
       proportionality. I find that in accordance with s.117B(1) the public
       interest in maintaining immigration control does not weigh  strongly
       against the claimants as despite the refusal under  the  Immigration
       Rules they were in  fact  able  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
       relevant Immigration Rules at  paragraph  41  at  the  time  of  the
       decisions to refuse entry clearance.  I  have  considered  that  the
       claimants have more than adequate funds and accommodation for  their
       visit, and find that in accordance with s.117B(3)  that  the  public
       interest in their being financially  independent  and  not  being  a
       burden on taxpayers is met. They also have  sufficient  English  for
       their visit.  Given the central and  highly  significant  Article  8
       ECHR rights that this visit concerns, which might be  summarised  as
       to be able to maintain established  strong  face  to  face  extended
       intergeneration family links which I find to be in the best interest
       of the children involved, and  the  lack  of  any  other  reasonably
       possible location for having such family meetings I  find  that  the
       decisions  to  refuse  entry  clearance   are   a   disproportionate
       interference with the Article 8 ECHR rights  of  the  claimants  and
       their UK family and sponsors.

          Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

   3. I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it on Article 8  ECHR
      grounds.
