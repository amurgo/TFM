                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the claimant: Not represented
For the respondent:    Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Perry promulgated 13.11.14,  allowing  the
    claimant's appeal against the decision of the  Secretary  of  State  to
    refuse his Tier 4 (General) Student  migrant  application  for  further
    leave to remain.  The Judge heard the appeal on 6.11.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  McClure  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    31.12.14.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 11.3.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Perry should be set aside.

 5. Something has gone seriously wrong with the appeal  process.  It  stems
    from the fact that there are two different decisions by  the  Secretary
    of State.

 6. The first is a decision dated 20.2.14 refusing an application  made  on
    14.11.12, because the claimant's CAS was not  valid  when  checked  and
    although he was given 60 days to submit a new one, he failed to do  so.



 7. The second is a decision dated 11.4.14 refusing a  further  application
    made on 12.2.14, because it appeared to the Secretary of State that the
    claimant had undertaken a further  course  of  study  in  breach  of  a
    condition  of  his  leave  imposed  by  section  50  of  the   Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.

 8. Only the second decision was appealed by the claimant, as confirmed  by
    the reference number on the notice of appeal.

 9. However, Judge Perry  purported  to  deal  with  both,  addressing  the
    earlier appeal at �14 and �15 of the decision.  Insofar  as  the  judge
    purported to deal with the first decision of the  Secretary  of  State,
    there was no jurisdiction to do so, since it has not been appealed.

10. The grounds of application for permission to appeal  address  only  the
    judge's treatment of the first decision of the Secretary of  State.  It
    follows that there are no valid grounds of appeal against  the  judge's
    findings and conclusions in respect of the second  decision,  the  only
    one subject of an appeal.

11. It follows that in the absence of any  valid  grounds  of  appeal,  the
    Secretary of State's appeal must fail as there is no challenge  to  the
    judge's decision in respect of the second decision of April 2014.

12. It also follows that the  first  decision  refusing  further  leave  to
    remain and including a decision to remove the  claimant  has  not  been
    appealed and stands.

13. This matter needs careful  attention  by  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    resolve the two conflicting situations, the extant refusal and removal,
    and the allowing of the appeal against the  second  decision  by  Judge
    Perry.

Conclusions:

14. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should
    be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in  respect  of
                    the appeal against the refusal  decision  dated  11.4.15
                    stands.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: There is no change in the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
which refused to make a fee award.
