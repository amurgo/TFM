      Representation:

      For the Appellant: Ms M. Chaggar (Counsel)
      For the  respondent:  Mr  D.  Mills  (Senior  Home  Office  Presenting
      Officer)



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




   1. This is the respondent's appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Hawden-Beal ("Judge Hawden-Beal")  promulgated  on  the
      10th December 2014. However, for the sake of clarity, throughout  this
      decision the parties will be referred to as they were referred  to  at
      the First-tier Tribunal hearing, such that Mrs Kalim is referred to as
      the appellant and the Entry Clearance Officer-Islamabad is referred to
      as the respondent.




           Background




   2. The appellant is a citizen  of  Pakistan  who  was  born  on  the  8th
      December 1993. She is married to Mr Kalim  Ahmed  Hussain,  a  British
      citizen. On the 7th October  2013  the  appellant  applied  for  entry
      clearance as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules  HC
      395, as amended. The appellant's application was initially refused  by
      the respondent on the 3rd February 2014, but at that  stage  no  final
      determination was made as to whether or  not  the  appellant  met  the
      income threshold and all related evidential requirements  pending  the
      outcome of the Court of Appeal case  of  MM  and  others,  R  (on  the
      application of) v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2014]
      EWCA Civ 985. Thereafter, following  the  decision  of  the  Court  of
      Appeal her application was re-refused on the 1st October 2014.




   3. The respondent was not satisfied that the appellant had  provided  all
      of the requisite evidence under  Appendix  FM-SE,  in  that  the  bank
      statements provided by the appellant did not show  the  whole  of  her
      sponsor's salary being paid into his bank account. Her application was
      therefore refused  under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1.(d)  with  reference  to
      paragraph E-ECP. 3.1 of Appendix FM. It was  further  found  that  the
      appellant had not proved that she had passed an English-language  test
      with a provider approved by UKBA, as although the appellant provided a
      TOIEC English language certificate, the respondent was  not  satisfied
      that it was genuine. Therefore the application was also refused  under
      paragraph EC-P.1.1 (d) with  reference  to  paragraph  E-ECP  4.1  and
      paragraph S-EC.2.2 (a) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.




   4. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal (Immigration  Asylum
      Chamber) and that appeal was heard in Birmingham on the  1st  December
      2014 by Judge Hawden-Beal. In her  decision  Judge  Hawden-Beal  found
      that the respondent had not discharged the burden of showing that  the
      English language certificate was not genuine. She went on to  consider
      whether or not the financial requirements of the Rules had been met at
      [20] of her decision. She found that  the  sponsor's  wages  were  not
      reflected  in  his  bank  statement  and  that  although  the  sponsor
      regularly deposited ï¿½260 per week that  did  not  amount  to  his  net
      monthly income from the restaurant where he was employed. Judge Hawden-
      Beal therefore found that the appellant had not proved  that  she  met
      all the requirements of Appendix  FM  and  FM-SE  of  the  Immigration
      Rules. The  appellant's  appeal  was  therefore  dismissed  under  the
      Immigration Rules.




   5. Judge Hawden-Beal then went on to find that  Appendix  FM  was  not  a
      complete code, insofar as Article 8 was concerned and  considered  the
      appellant's claim outside of the Immigration Rules, adopting the  five
      stage Razgar test as set out by the House of Lords in the case of R  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department (appellant) ex parte Razgar
      (FC) (respondent) [2004] UKHL 27. In determining the fifth question as
      to  whether  or  not  the  decision  to  remove  the   appellant   was
      proportionate to the legitimate public aim sought to be  achieved,  at
      [25] the First-tier Judge stated that she could not be satisfied  that
      the decision was proportionate:




                 "because it is clear and accepted by  the  respondent  that
                 the  sponsor  does  earn  in  excess   of   the   financial
                 requirements imposed by Appendix  FM  because  the  amended
                 refusal notice  only  refuses  the  application  under  the
                 financial requirements on the basis that the wages are  not
                 reflected in the bank statements".




   6. The First-tier Tribunal Judge found that there was no statement to say
      that the sponsor did not earn in excess of  the  required  amount  and
      that the case could be distinguished from MM on  the  basis  that  the
      appellant will be maintained without recourse to public funds, "as  is
      demonstrated by the sponsor's recognised earnings." She therefore went
      on to find that the decision to refuse entry clearance would place the
      UK  in  breach  of  its  obligations  under  the  1950  Human   Rights
      Convention. She allowed the appeal therefore on human  rights  grounds
      in respect of the appellant's family life under Article 8.




   7. In the grounds of appeal, it is argued that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge made a material error in law, when, after having found that  the
      appellant did not meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE  as  the
      sponsor's wages were not reflected within his  bank  statements,  then
      allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds  outside  of  the  Immigration
      Rules. It is argued that the 'Near-Miss' principle was  considered  by
      Lord Justice Stanley Burnton in case of Miah and others v Secretary of
      State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 261, wherein at [25]  he
      stated that:




                 "Moreover, once an apparently bright-line rule is  regarded
                 as subject to a Near-Miss penumbra, and a decision is  made
                 in favour of a near-miss applicant on that  basis,  another
                 applicant will appear claiming to be a  near-miss  to  that
                 near-miss.  There  would  be  a  steep  slope   away   from
                 predictable rules, the efficacy and utility of which  would
                 be undermined."




   8. It is argued that the 'Near-Miss' principle was rejected by the  Court
      of Appeal in Miah, and this this view  was  endorsed  by  the  Supreme
      Court in the case of Patel and others v Secretary  of  State  for  the
      Home Department  [2013]  UKSC  72.  The  respondent  argues  that  the
      decision of the First-tier Judge is fundamentally flawed, in  that  as
      the appellant did not meet the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
      in respect of the specified evidence, this then did  not  give  her  a
      basis to be granted leave to enter the UK on Article 8 grounds. It  is
      argued that following the Supreme Court decision in Patel,  Article  8
      should not be used as a means of subverting the criteria for  a  grant
      of leave to enter or remain set out in the Immigration Rules and  that
      a 'Near-Miss' under the Rules cannot  provide  substance  to  a  human
      rights claim otherwise lacking in merit.




   9. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Plumptre
      on the 2nd February 2015 on the grounds that it was arguable that  the
      First-tier Judge had erred in applying  Article  8  to  the  mandatory
      requirements of Appendix FM-SE, and that if the  sponsor  is  paid  in
      cash then all  the  monies  received  from  employment  must  be  paid
      directly into a bank account and arguably erred  in  her  analysis  of
      those mandatory requirements. She also considered it was arguable  the
      First-tier Judge erred in law and fact by stating that the  respondent
      accepted that the sponsor earned in excess of the requirements imposed
      by Appendix FM.




           Submissions




  10. At the start of his submissions on behalf of the respondent  Mr  Mills
      handed up the  recent  case  of  The  Secretary  State  for  the  Home
      Department v SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387.  He  submitted  that  the
      Court of Appeal had found  that  the  'Near-Miss'  principle  was  not
      wholly irrelevant, but that the Court of Appeal had made it clear that
      the  financial  evidential  requirements  of   Appendix   FM-SE   were
      substantive requirements, rather than merely technical and that  there
      had to be compelling circumstances to justify  a  grant  of  leave  to
      enter or leave to remain where the evidential rules were not  complied
      with. He referred us in this regard to [51]. He argued that where  the
      Immigration Rules were not met due to the evidential requirements  not
      being satisfied, it was wrong for the Judge to simply allow the appeal
      under Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules. He argued  that  the
      Judge's reasoning in [25]  of  the  decision  regarding  why  she  had
      allowed the appeal outside of the Rules was wholly inadequate.




  11. He further submitted that the Court of Appeal in SS (Congo)  had  made
      the point that it would generally be proportionate to expect people to
      re-apply, if they failed to meet the requirements of  the  Immigration
      Rules, but that this issue had not been considered at all by the First-
      tier Judge and that there was no  evidence  of  any  hardship  if  the
      appellant simply had to  re-apply.  He  asked  us  to  set  aside  the
      decision and to dismiss the appeal.




  12. In her submissions on behalf of the  appellant  Ms  Chaggar  submitted
      that between [21] and [25] the First-tier Tribunal Judge had  properly
      considered Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules and had properly
      considered that the decision taken was  disproportionate.  She  argued
      that the Judge had properly considered the relevant case law including
      the cases of R (on the application of Nagre) v Secretary of State  for
      the Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin), Gulshan (Article 8 -  new
      Rules - correct approach) [2013] UKUT 640 (IAC) and R (Ganesabalan)  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWHC  2712  (Admin),
      and had found that there were  arguably  good  grounds  why  the  case
      should be considered under Article 8 outside of the Immigration Rules,
      and that the Immigration Rules were not a complete code in respect  of
      Article 8 considerations regarding family life under Appendix FM.  She
      argued that the Judge had properly found that there  was  family  life
      existing and that the relationship between the appellant, her  husband
      and son was genuine and subsisting  and  that  they  had  family  life
      together and that the Judge  properly  considered  proportionality  at
      [25] of the decision. She argued that the fact that the wages were not
      reflected within the bank statement was not the only issue  considered
      by the First-tier Tribunal Judge at [21] to [25]. She argued that  the
      Court of Appeal in the case of SS (Congo) had made it clear at [56] of
      the judgment that the 'Near-Miss' principle was relevant to the  issue
      of  proportionality.  She  further  submitted  that  there  had   been
      discussion at the original appeal hearing, as to whether  or  not  the
      sponsor's income did in  fact  exceed  the  financial  requirement  of
      ï¿½18,600, as specified  by  the  Immigration  Rules  and  that  it  was
      apparent from the First-tier Judge's decision that it had been  agreed
      that the sponsor did in fact earn in excess of the  requisite  amount.
      She asked us to dismiss the appeal.




           Error of Law




  13. Support for a 'Near-Miss' principle, was originally propounded in  the
      judgment of Sedley LJ in the case of Pankina v Secretary of State  for
      the Home Department [2010] EWCA  Civ 719 at [46], wherein he stated:




                  "It is one thing  to  expect  an  applicant  to  have  the
                 necessary academic and linguistic  qualifications:  here  a
                 miss is likely to be as good as a mile. It is  another  for
                 an applicant to fall marginally or momentarily short  of  a
                 financial criterion which in itself  has  no  meaning:  its
                 significance is  as  a  rough  and  ready  measure  of  the
                 applicant's ability to continue to live without reliance on
                 public funds. Having ï¿½800 in the bank,  whether  for  three
                 continuous months or simply at the date of application,  is
                 no doubt some indication of this; but people who  are  able
                 to meet the test may fall on  hard  times  after  obtaining
                 indefinite leave to remain, and others who fail  it  would,
                 if allowed to remain,  never  become  a  charge  on  public
                 funds. The Home Office has to exercise  some  common  sense
                 about  this  if  it  is  not  to   make   decisions   which
                 disproportionately deny respect to the private  and  family
                 lives of graduates who by definition have been settled here
                 for some years and are otherwise eligible for Tier 1 entry.
                 If the Home Secretary wishes the rules  to  be  blackletter
                 law,  she  needs  to  achieve  this   by   an   established
                 legislative route."







  14. However, the existence of a 'Near-Miss' principle was roundly rejected
      by Lord Justice Stanley Burnton in the Court of Appeal  case  of  Miah
      and others v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2012]  EWCA
      Civ 261. At [26] of his judgment, Lord Justice Stanley Burnton stated:




                  "I would dismiss the appeal in relation to  the  Near-Miss
                 argument. In my judgment, there is no  Near-Miss  principle
                 applicable to  the  Immigration  Rules.  The  Secretary  of
                 State, and on appeal the Tribunal, must assess the strength
                 of an Article 8 claim, but the requirements of  immigration
                 control is not weakened by  the  degree  of  non-compliance
                 with the Immigration Rules."




  15. The existence of a 'Near-Miss' principle was then  considered  by  the
      Supreme Court in the case of Patel and others v Secretary of State for
      the Home Department (respondent) [2013] UKSC 72. Lord  Carnwath,  with
      whom Lord Kerr, Lord Reid and Lord Hughes agreed, in  considering  the
      'Near-Miss' argument at [56] stated that :




                 "Although the context of the rules may be relevant  to  the
                 consideration of proportionality, I agree with  Burnton  LJ
                 that this cannot be equated with a  formalised  "near-miss"
                 or "sliding scale" principle, as argued for  by  Mr  Malik.
                 That approach is unsupported by Strasbourg authority, or by
                 a proper reading of Lord Bingham's words. Mrs Huang's  case
                 for favourable treatment outside the rules did not turn  on
                 how close she had come to compliance with rule 317, but  on
                 the application of the family values  which  underlie  that
                 rule and are at the heart also of article 8. Conversely,  a
                 near-miss under the rules cannot  provide  substance  to  a
                 human rights case which is otherwise lacking in merit."




           He continued to state at [57] that:




                 "It is important to  remember  that  article  8  is  not  a
                 general dispensing power. It is to  be  distinguished  from
                 the Secretary of  State's  discretion  to  allow  leave  to
                 remain outside the rules, which may  be  unrelated  to  any
                 protected human right."




  16. Clarification as to the  relevance  of  a  'Near-Miss'  has  now  been
      provided by the Court of Appeal in the case of The Secretary of  State
      for the Home Department v SS (Congo) and others [2015] EWCA  Civ  387.
      Lord Justice Richards, giving the lead judgment of the Court of Appeal
      when discussing the evidential rules  under  Appendix  FM-SE,  between
      [50] and [53] of his judgment stated :




                 "50. The present appeals concern  not  only  the  leave  to
                 enter Rules in Appendix FM which set  out  the  substantive
                 conditions which have to be satisfied in  relation  to  the
                 minimum income requirements for a  sponsor,  but  also  the
                 Rules  in  Appendix  FM-SE  which  stipulate  the  form  of
                 evidence  required  to   substantiate   claims   that   the
                 substantive financial requirements under Appendix  FM  have
                 been met. Appendix FM-SE deals with  matters  such  as  the
                 types of bank statements, payslips, income, savings and  so
                 forth which will be regarded as  acceptable.  In  addition,
                 section A1.1(b) states, "Promises of  third  party  support
                 will  not  be  accepted",   and   stipulates   the   highly
                 circumscribed forms which support  from  third  parties  is
                 required to take.
              1. In our judgment, the approach to Article 8 in the light  of
                 the Rules in Appendix  FM-SE  should  be  the  same  as  in
                 respect of the substantive leave  to  enter  and  leave  to
                 remain Rules in Appendix  FM.  In  other  words,  the  same
                 general position  applies,  that  compelling  circumstances
                 would have to apply to justify a grant of leave to enter or
                 leave to remain where the evidence Rules are  not  complied
                 with.
              1. This is for two  principal  reasons.  First,  the  evidence
                 rules have the same general objective  as  the  substantive
                 rules, namely to limit the risk that  someone  is  admitted
                 into the United Kingdom and then becomes a burden on public
                 resources, and the Secretary of State has the same  primary
                 function in relation to them, to assess the risk and put in
                 place measures which are  judged  suitable  to  contain  it
                 within acceptable bounds. Similar weight should be given to
                 her assessment of what the public interest requires in both
                 contexts.
              1. Secondly, enforcement of the evidence  rules  ensures  that
                 everyone applying for leave to enter or leave to remain  is
                 treated equally and fairly in relation  to  the  evidential
                 requirements they must satisfy.  As  well  as  keeping  the
                 costs   of   administration   within   reasonable   bounds,
                 application of standard rules  is  an  important  means  of
                 minimising the risk of arbitrary differences  in  treatment
                 of cases  arising  across  the  wide  range  of  officials,
                 tribunals  and  courts  which  administer  the  system   of
                 immigration controls. In this regard,  the  evidence  Rules
                 (like the  substantive  Rules)  serve  as  a  safeguard  in
                 relation to rights of applicants and family  members  under
                 Article 14 to equal treatment within the scope  of  Article
                 8"



  17. Lord Justice Richards went on to consider the situation  of  a  'Near-
      Miss' case at paragraphs [54] to [56]  of  his  judgment,  wherein  he
      stated:




           "54.  At the hearing, there was debate about the proper approach
           to be adopted in 'near miss' cases, for example if  the  sponsor
           of an applicant for leave to enter could provide evidence of  an
           annual income a little less than the ï¿½18,600 required  or  could
           provide evidence which might be regarded as similar to (but  not
           the same as) that required under Appendix FM-SE. Mr  Payne,  for
           the Secretary of State, made submissions to the effect  that  'a
           miss is as good as a mile' and that the fact that one is dealing
           with a 'near miss' case should be irrelevant to  the  Article  8
           balancing  exercise  required.  The  general  position  of   the
           respondents, on the other hand, was that great weight should  be
           attached to the  fact  that  there  was  a  'near  miss'  by  an
           applicant in relation to the requirements of the Rules.
        1.  In  our  judgment,  the  true  position  lies   between   these
           submissions. Contrary to the argument of the  respondents,  that
           fact that an applicant may be able to say that their case  is  a
           'near miss' in relation to satisfying the  requirements  of  the
           Rules will by no means show that compelling circumstances  exist
           requiring the grant of leave to enter outside the Rules. A  good
           deal more than this would need to be shown to make  out  such  a
           case. The respondents' argument fails to recognise the value  to
           be attached  to  having  a  clear  statement  of  the  standards
           applicable to everyone and fails to give proper  weight  to  the
           judgment of the Secretary of State, as expressed in  the  Rules,
           regarding what is needed to meet the public interest which is in
           issue. The 'near miss' argument of  the  respondents  cannot  be
           sustained in the light of these considerations and the authority
           of Miah v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA
           Civ 261, especially at [21]-[26].
        1. However, it cannot be said that the fact that a case involves  a
           'near miss' in relation to the requirements set out in the Rules
           is wholly irrelevant to the balancing  exercise  required  under
           Article 8. If an applicant can show that  there  are  individual
           interests at stake covered by Article 8 which  give  rise  to  a
           strong claim that compelling circumstances may exist to  justify
           the grant of leave to enter outside the  Rules,  the  fact  that
           their case is  also  a  'near  miss'  case  may  be  a  relevant
           consideration which tips the balance under Article  8  in  their
           favour. In such a case, the applicant will be able to  say  that
           the detrimental impact on the public interest in issue if  leave
           to enter is granted in their favour will be somewhat  less  than
           in a case where the gap between the applicant's position and the
           requirements of the Rules is great, and the risk that  they  may
           end  up  having  recourse  to  public  funds  and  resources  is
           therefore greater."



  18. We therefore find, in light of the above case law, that if a  case  is
      simply a 'Near-Miss', that in itself  is  insufficient  to  justify  a
      grant of leave outside of the Immigration Rules on Article 8  grounds.
      As was said by Lord Justice Richards at [55] of SS Congo:




                 "The fact that an appellant may be able to say  that  their
                 case  is  a  'Near-Miss'  in  relation  to  satisfying  the
                 requirements of the  Rules  will  by  no  means  show  that
                 compelling circumstances exist requiring the grant of leave
                 to enter outside the Rules."




           It  is  therefore  necessary  for   there   to   be   compelling
           circumstances for leave to be granted outside the Rules,  rather
           than simply the case being a 'Near-Miss' case in respect of  the
           evidential requirements under the Rules.  Although  we  bear  in
           mind that if there are such compelling circumstances to  justify
           the grant of leave to enter outside the Rules, the fact that the
           case is also 'Near-Miss' may be a relevant  consideration  which
           may tip the Article 8 consideration in an appellant, but  simply
           being a 'Near-Miss' case in itself is insufficient.




  19. Although in her decision First-tier Tribunal Judge Hawden-Beal at [22]
       stated that she found that  there  were  arguably  good  grounds  for
      granting leave to remain outside of the  Rules,  no  adequate  reasons
      were given in that paragraph for such a finding. Indeed at [25] of the
      decision, when considering the proportionality  exercise,  the  First-
      tier Judge simply stated:




                   "That  leaves  the  question  as   to   whether   it   is
                 proportionate to the legitimate public  end  sought  to  be
                 achieved and I cannot be satisfied that it is because it is
                 clear and accepted by the respondent that the sponsor  does
                 earn in excess of the  financial  requirements  imposed  by
                 Appendix FM because the amended refusal notice only refuses
                 the application under the  financial  requirements  on  the
                 basis  that  the  wages  are  not  reflected  in  the  bank
                 statements."




           She went on to find in the same paragraph that:




                  "This case can be distinguished from MM on the  basis  the
                 appellant will be maintained  without  recourse  to  public
                 funds  as  is  demonstrated  by  the  sponsor's  recognised
                 earnings. In the circumstances I find that the decision  to
                 refuse entry clearance will place the UK in breach  of  its
                 obligations under the 1950 Human Rights Convention."




  20. It is apparent when reading the decision that the only reason why  the
           First-tier Judge considered the decision to  be  disproportionate
      to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved was because of  the
      fact that the sponsor did, in her judgment,  earn  in  excess  of  the
      financial requirement of ï¿½18,600, even though the sponsor's wages were
      not reflected in his bank statements. It is in our judgment clear that
      the First-tier Judge has relied upon a 'Near-Miss' in respect  of  the
      evidential requirements,  in  that  although  the  appellant  had  not
      produced enough documentary evidence to prove her sponsor's income for
      the purposes of Appendix FM-SE, the fact that Judge Hawden-Beal  found
      that the sponsor did in fact earn in excess of ï¿½18,600,  was  said  by
      her to justify allowing the appeal under  Article  8  outside  of  the
      Immigration Rules. She did not set out  any  compelling  circumstances
      said to justify the grant of leave to enter outside  the  Rules,  such
      that the fact that this  was  also  a  'Near-Miss'  case  could  be  a
      relevant consideration which tipped the balance under Article 8 in the
      appellant's favour. None are evident in the findings of the First-tier
      Judge and none were evident in submissions before us.  It  was  simply
      that having found that in fact the appellant did earn in excess of the
      ï¿½18,600 required, she considered that the appeal  should   be  allowed
      under Article 8 outside of the  Immigration  Rules,  even  though  the
      evidential requirements under the Rules were not met.




  21. The First-tier Tribunal Judge thereby materially  misdirected  herself
      in law. It was not open to her, as a matter of law, to find  that  the
      appeal should be  allowed  outside  of  the  Immigration  Rules  under
      Article 8, simply because in her judgment, the sponsor did  earn  more
      than the  requisite  ï¿½18,600,  when  the  evidential  requirements  of
      Appendix FM-SE  were  not  met.  The  decision  of  Judge  Hawden-Beal
      therefore contains a material error of law requiring the  decision  to
      be set aside.




  22.  It is therefore necessary for us to re-make the decision. We preserve
      the findings of Judge Hawden-Beal that the sponsor's  wages  were  not
      reflected in his bank statements and that although he  deposited  ï¿½260
      per week, that did not amount to  his  net  monthly  income  from  the
      restaurant where  he  worked,  and  that  in  such  circumstances  the
      requirement of paragraph 2 (c) of Appendix FM-SE that that  there  had
      to be:




                 "personal  bank  statements  corresponding  to   the   same
                 period(s) as the payslips at paragraph 2 (a), showing  that
                 the salary had been paid into an account in the name of the
                 person or in the name  of  the  person  and  their  partner
                 jointly"




           was not met, such that the appellant did not meet the  specified
           evidence criteria under Appendix FM-SE, necessary to  prove  her
           sponsor's income under the Rules.  The  appellant's  application
           was properly refused under paragraph EC-P.1.1 (d) of Appendix FM
           of the Immigration Rules, with reference to paragraph  E-ECP.3.1
           .




  23. We further find that there are no compelling circumstances that  exist
      in this case that would require the grant of leave to enter outside of
      the Immigration Rules. None are  evident  in  the  findings  of  Judge
      Hawden-Beal and none were evident in submissions before us. The First-
      tier Judge's finding that in fact the sponsor did earn  in  excess  of
      ï¿½18,600,  does  not  justify  the  grant  of  leave  outside  of   the
      Immigration  Rules  and  does  not  mean   that   the   decision   was
      disproportionate to the legitimate public aim sought  to  be  achieved
      for the purposes of Article 8, in circumstances  where  the  requisite
      evidence that the sponsor earned the necessary  amount  had  not  been
      provided. We take into account that the need  for  specified  evidence
      promotes predictability and consistency as  between  applications  for
      leave to enter.




  24. We find that this is simply a  'Near-Miss'  case  in  respect  of  the
      evidential requirements in that the appellant had not produced  enough
      documentary evidence to prove her sponsor's  income  exceeded  ï¿½18,600
      for the purposes of Appendix FM-SE, even if he did  in  fact  earn  in
      excess  of  ï¿½18,600  and  that  in  the  absence  of  any   compelling
      circumstances sufficient to  justify  the  grant  of  leave  to  enter
      outside the Immigration Rules, the appellant's appeal should also have
      been dismissed under Article  8.  We  therefore  dismiss  Mrs  Kalim's
      appeal both under the Immigration Rules and on  human  rights  grounds
      under Article 8 of the ECHR.




           Decision

           The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of
           an error on a point of law and is set aside. The decision is re-
           made dismissing the appellant's, Mrs Kalim's appeal, both  under
           the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds under  Article
           8 of the ECHR.

      Signed
                                           Dated 31st July 2015
