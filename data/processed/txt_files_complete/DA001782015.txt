                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is a challenge by the Secretary of State to a decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Eames ('the Judge') promulgated on 7 March 2016  in
    which the Judge allowed the appellant's appeal  against  the  order  to
    deport him from the United Kingdom.  Mr Jurkowski ('the appellant')  is
    not present in court  today  as  he  has  been  removed  to  Poland  in
    accordance with  the  Secretary  of  State's  powers,  which  has  been
    recently confirmed by the Court of Appeal in  another  case  to  be  an
    entirely lawful action.

2.   Permission to appeal was  granted  by  Designated  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Manuell on 5 April 2016, the relevant part  of  the  grant  being
    paragraph 3 in which the Judge Manuell states:

         "Allowing due recognition to the judge's  considerable  experience,
         his conclusions might well be thought surprising given the  serious
         nature of  the  appellant's  offence  and  the  fact  that  it  was
         committed within three years  of  entry.   The  judge  appears  (as
         complained) to  have  engaged  in  mitigation  in  the  appellant's
         absence.  There was no evidence that the appellant had sought leave
         to enter for the purpose of attending his appeal hearing.   All  of
         the grounds are arguable."

3.   The appellant was represented in the early part of  these  proceedings.
    The Tribunal received a letter from Turpin & Miller LLP Solicitors on 5
    May 2016 confirming they are no longer instructed by the  appellant  in
    relation to the appeal listed at Field House on 13 May  2016.   I  find
    there has been valid service of notice of the place, date and venue  of
    this hearing prior to  the  solicitors  coming  off  the  record.   The
    solicitors do make the observation that as the  appellant  was  removed
    from the UK they do not have any forwarding address for him.  There has
    been no attempt to update the Tribunal with any further  correspondence
    address.

4.   The determination notes that the appellant  is  a  national  of  Poland
    born on 13 September 1984.  No anonymity direction has been  made.   He
    is the subject of a deportation order as a result of a conviction on 28
    February 2014 of attempted robbery for which he  was  sentenced  on  11
    April  2014  to  30  months'  imprisonment.   The  Judge  set  out  the
    immigration  and  offending  history  at  paragraphs  4  to  7  of  the
    determination and the findings of fact at paragraphs 38 to 56.

5.   At paragraph 43 are the sentencing judge's remarks that  arose  in  the
    Northampton Crown Court where the Judge refers to the fact that  on  10
    January 2014 at 10pm the appellant went  into  a  newsagents,  a  small
    shop, with  the  complainant  behind  the  counter  on  his  own.   The
    appellant, and I use that term in respect of the appellant  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, entered the shop. The complainant turned to take a
    bottle from the shelf when the appellant jumped at him and  pushed  him
    into a storeroom, landed on top of him, produced a kitchen knife with a
    four-inch blade and threatened him claiming "you give me all your money
    if you don't give me the money you're dead".   The  incident  was  only
    stopped, it is claimed, as a result of the fact that other people  came
    into the shop, at which point the appellant left.  The sentencing judge
    refers to the serious nature of the offence involving  the  use  of  an
    offensive weapon and the fact that  it  was  so  serious  that  it  was
    necessary to impose a custodial sentence.   In  addition  to  that  the
    Judge had available to him an OASys Report  prepared  by  the  National
    Probation Service which is to be found  at  the  Secretary  of  State's
    bundle, pages D4 and D7.

6.   It is important in relation to this hearing that  we  remind  ourselves
    of the relevant law relating to the  deportation  of  an  EU  national.
    Deportation of EU nationals is covered by Directive 2004/38/EC which is
    implemented by the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 ("the Regulations").  In relation  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    power to remove an EU national, by virtue of Regulation 19(3) a  person
    who has been admitted to or acquired a right to reside  in  the  United
    Kingdom under these Regulations may be removed from the United  Kingdom
    if:

    (a)  he does not have or ceases to have a right to reside  under  these
         Regulations; or


    (b)  he would otherwise be entitled to reside  in  the  United  Kingdom
         under these Regulations but the Secretary of State has decided that
         his removal is justified on the grounds of  public  policy,  public
         security or public health in accordance with Regulation 21.

    The relevant  section  in  this  appeal  is  Regulation  19(3)(b),  the
    appellant being a worker exercising treaty rights in the United Kingdom
    but in relation to whom, as a result of the offence, the  Secretary  of
    State has decided that his removal is justified on  grounds  of  public
    policy, public security or public health.

7.   By virtue of Regulation 26 of the 2006 Regulations an EEA national  may
    only be removed if his  removal  is  justified  on  grounds  of  public
    policy, public health or public security.  It  is  not  suggested  that
    public health is a live issue  in  relation  to  this  matter.   Public
    policy, and it is argued by the Secretary of State public security, are
    relevant issues.  Regulation 21(5) to 21(6) provide guidance consistent
    with earlier EU law on the  proper  approach  to  making  decisions  on
    public policy and public security, Regulation 21(5) stating that  where
    a relevant decision is taken on grounds  of  public  policy  or  public
    security  it  shall,  in  addition  to  complying  with  the  preceding
    paragraphs of the Regulation, be taken in accordance with the following
    principles:

    (a)  the decision must comply with the principle of proportionality;


    (b)  the decision must be based exclusively on the personal conduct  of
         the person concerned;


    (c)  the personal conduct of the  person  concerned  must  represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
         the fundamental interests of society;


    (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case which relate  to
         consideration of general prevention, do not justify the decision;


    (e)  a person's previous convictions do not in themselves  justify  the
         decision.


    Regulation 21(6) states that:


         "Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of public  policy
         or public security in relation to a person who is resident  in  the
         United  Kingdom  the  decision-maker  must  take  into  account  in
         consideration such as the age, state of health, family and economic
         situations of the person, the person's length of residence  in  the
         United Kingdom, the person's social and cultural  integration  into
         the United Kingdom and the extent of the person's  links  with  his
         country of origin."


8.   In relation to the fundamental interests of society GW (EEA  Regulation
    21: Fundamental interests) Netherlands [2009] UKIAT 50  is  a  case  in
    which the Tribunal said that the fundamental  interests  of  a  society
    within the meaning of Regulation 21, a threat to which may justify  the
    exclusion of an EEA  national,  is  a  question  to  be  determined  by
    reference to the legal rules  governing  society  in  question.  It  is
    unlikely that conduct that is subject to no prohibition can be regarded
    as threatening those interests.


9.   In this case the evidence  before  the  First-tier  Judge  was  that  a
    serious act of violence, including the threat of death and  injury  and
    the use of an offensive weapon, had occurred for  personal  gain  which
    indicated a propensity to offend and violently offend.   The  fear  for
    the future is said to be a repeat of such violent  offending  which  is
    prohibited by the laws of the United Kingdom.   Therefore  there  is  a
    fundamental interest of society at stake in relation to this appeal.

10.  The Judge makes comment about the nature of EEA law  and  the  need  to
    take care when interfering with fundamental  rights  arising  under  EU
    law.  This position is legally correct for the public policy ground for
    removal is an exception to  the  fundamental  principles  of  the  free
    exercise of EU rights and as such has to  be  construed  restrictively.
    In R v Bouchereau [1978] QB 732  it  was  said  that  the  presence  or
    conduct of the individual should constitute a genuine and  sufficiently
    serious threat to public policy.  That  was  a  matter  the  Judge  was
    specifically asked to make findings upon and to which  I  shall  return
    shortly.

11.  The need for the Judge to consider the question of future offending  is
    a key element of this appeal as recently  confirmed  by  the  Court  of
    Appeal in the Secretary of  State  v  Arturus  Dumliauskas  and  Lukasz
    Wozniak and ME (Netherlands) [2015]  EWCA  Civ  145  in  which  it  was
    stated, at  paragraphs  40  and  55  that  if  there  was  no  risk  of
    reoffending then the power to deport nationals of other  Member  States
    on the grounds of public policy or  public  security  does  not  arise.
    Therefore, if the Judge's finding in the current appeal was that  there
    was no risk of reoffending it is arguable there was no need to go on to
    consider the proportionality of the decision.

12.  The Judge's findings in relation to the risk  of  reoffending  are  set
    out at paragraphs 46, 47 and 48 of the determination.  At 46 the  Judge
    finds:

         "46. As I have noted in my findings of fact  above,  the  appellant
             accepts that the offending was a shameful thing to have  done.
             He expresses remorse and sorrow and empathy  with  the  victim
             now.  Whilst of  course  those  comments  may  well  be  self-
             serving, on balance I accept them as  accurate.   That  is  in
             part  in  light  of  the  circumstances  that   produced   the
             offending, and the  fact  the  appellant  has  no  history  of
             offending.


         47.  The OASys assessment is that there  is  a  low  likelihood  of
             reconviction.  It is only if he did reoffend that the risk  of
             serious harm to others would arise (a medium risk),  so  given
             the low likelihood of reoffending, that risk of harm to others
             is not a likely outcome.


         48.  But I have taken into  account  Mrs  Arnesen's  argument  that
             having him in the UK is not good  for  UK  society,  and  that
             although he has had the opportunity to lead a good life in the
             UK he failed to stay within the law.  I do not find that  this
             translates into a future risk of failing to  stay  within  the
             law however."

13.  The Judge's findings  in  relation  to  the  risk  of  reoffending  are
    arguably based upon a misdirection of law as asserted  in  the  grounds
    seeking permission to appeal and also are  inadequately  reasoned.   If
    one turns to the OASys Report it is important to note the comments made
    by the author of that report in relation to the  risk  of  reoffending.
    It is correct that the author of the report assesses the likelihood  of
    reconviction as low, a 0 to 40 percentage chance based upon  a  maximum
    scale of 168 and, also, that were there to be reoffending the level  of
    risk of serious harm is medium.  What the Judge does not appear to have
    factored into account in assessing the risk of reoffending are the risk
    factors identified at page D4 of the OASys Report which are the use  of
    alcohol, the use of weapons (a  bladed  knife),  and  anger  management
    issues.  It is clear that it was the combination of such  factors  that
    led the appellant to offend.  What has not been presented, and was  not
    available to the First-tier Tribunal, was sufficient  evidence  of  any
    work being undertaken  by  the  appellant  to  address  those  specific
    issues.  Particularly in regard to anger  management  and  alcohol,  as
    there appeared  to  be  a  connection  between  such  matters  and  the
    financial difficulties being experienced by the  appellant  within  the
    United Kingdom.  It cannot be said by the Judge that such  matters  had
    been addressed as clearly there was no relevant evidence of this.   The
    misdirection of law arises as the Judge appears to have  believed  that
    as the OASys Report stated there was a low risk of harm this equates to
    there being no risk of reoffending or such a minimal risk that it could
    effectively be ignored.  The grounds refer to the case  of  Vasconcelos
    (Risk - rehabilitation [2013] UKUT 378 IAC.  The headnote of  which  in
    paragraph 1 states:


         "In assessing whether an EEA national represents a  current  threat
         to public policy by reason of a risk of resumption of opportunistic
         offending, the Tribunal should consider any statistical  assessment
         of reoffending provided by NOMS but is not bound by  such  data  if
         the overall assessment of the evidence supports the  conclusion  of
         continued risk."


    It  was  arguably  irrational  for  the  Judge,   notwithstanding   his
    experience, to focus solely upon the risk of reoffending being assessed
    at low without adequately analysing what it is said by  the  author  of
    the OASys Report was responsible for or led to the offence in question.



14.  The second issue is that having found that the risk of harm was  not  a
    likely outcome, the Judge went on to consider  the  proportionality  of
    the decision  at  paragraphs  50  to  55  of  the  determination.   The
    criticism relied upon  by  Mr  Tarlow  before  me  today,  is  that  at
    paragraph 50 the Judge sets out the matters in the appellant's  favour,
    in 51 the matters in the Secretary of State's favour, and then makes  a
    statement  that  the  Judge  did  not  find  the  decision  to   be   a
    proportionate response to the legitimate imperatives of  public  policy
    and  public  security.   This  ground  raises  an  arguably   justified
    criticism by the Secretary of State as one is required to do more  than
    just set out factors A and factors B.  Had the Judge analysed how these
    factors integrate with  each  other  and  looked  at  the  question  of
    rehabilitation, it may have been a finding that was within a  range  of
    those available to the Judge.  The fact of the matter is the Judge  did
    not undertake a properly balanced  proportionality  assessment,  if  in
    fact one was required in light of the findings at paragraphs 46 to  48.



15.  I find Mr Tarlow has made out the grounds of challenge as  set  out  in
    the pleadings and referred to in the grant of permission to appeal  and
    for that reason I find the Judge has erred in law in a manner  that  is
    material to the decision to allow the appeal.

16.  In light of the fact there is no fresh evidence being relied  upon,  or
    any reason why the Tribunal should not proceed to remake  the  decision
    on the basis of the material that was before the First-tier Tribunal, I
    proceed to do so.

17.  The Judge's findings of fact  at  paragraph  38  (a)  to  (k)  are  not
    challenged by the Secretary of  State.   These  are  in  the  following
    terms:

         "(a) The appellant is a citizen of Poland who arrived in the UK  in
             2012.  He has the family he says he has -  a  wife  and  three
             children.


         (b)  Aside from his imprisonment, he has been a  qualified  person,
             working as an employee in the UK or going through gaps in  his
             work when he was looking for other work.  As he arrived  after
             2011 he did not need to be registered as an A8 worker.  He  is
             relatively employable, as a person  with  construction  skills
             and a propensity for hard work; an employer has offered him  a
             job.


         (c)  The index offence was as described by the sentencing judge and
             at page D5 of the OASys Report.  He has no previous history of
             offending of any kind.


         (d)  The likelihood of the appellant being reconvicted is low.   If
             he did reoffend, the risk of serious harm to others  would  be
             medium.   It  would  affect  the  general  public   and   shop
             assistants.   The  risk  factors  as  to  the  possibility  of
             reoffending would be alcohol,  use  of  a  knife,  and  anger.
             Financial stress is also a potential factor.


         (e)  The appellant has  not  appealed  against  his  conviction  or
             sentence.  The appellant has not completed any  rehabilitative
             courses since offending.  He expresses remorse and a desire to
             apologise to the victim and to seek his forgiveness.


         (f)  I find  that  he  does  accept  his  responsibility  for  what
             happened, and has re-evaluated his attitude to  offending.   I
             also find that the efforts made by his partner  would  now  be
             rewarded by positive change than in the past  because  of  his
             realisation of the shame of what he did.  I accept that he has
             an understanding of the factors that led to the offending.


         (g)  I find that the appellant would live together  with  his  wife
             and children were he allowed to remain in the United  Kingdom.




         (h)  The appellant has been in  the  UK  for  three  years  and  is
             familiar with UK culture and  the  way  of  life,  and  speaks
             English.  He has worked in the UK.  Prior to that  he  was  in
             Poland all his life; it is where he was educated and  grew  up
             as a child and younger adult.  I find it very likely  that  he
             has not lost touch with the Polish way of life or  the  Polish
             language.  But overall I find that he has integrated  with  UK
             society and the British way of life.  The offending undermines
             that integration but not entirely.


         (i)  The appellant has a job offer.  Whether that remains open  now
             he has been deported is another matter.  But it  shows  he  is
             employable.


         (j)  The appellant is not alcoholic.  He drinks though.   This  can
             be  to  excess  but  is  not  an  illness  or  addiction.   It
             interferes with his judgment.


         (k)   The  appellant  and  his  family  have  undergone   financial
             hardship.  He now  understands  the  effect  of  that  on  his
             drinking and the combined effect that drinking  and  financial
             anxiety had on his behaviour.  I accept that understanding  is
             very likely to reduce the risk of reoffending in line with the
             OASys assessment of propensity."

18.  Considering that, and for the reasons I referred to above, the  offence
    committed by the appellant is a very serious offence and illustrates  a
    propensity, or something within the appellant's personality, that leads
    him to commit violent offences using a bladed instrument  for  his  own
    personal gain.  I referred earlier to the fact that elements that  were
    considered as part of the  understanding  of  offending  and  the  risk
    factors as to the possibility of reoffending, include alcohol, the  use
    of a knife and anger management issues, as well  as  financial  stress.
    There is no evidence before this court that the  appellant  has  a  job
    offer open to him that is still a genuine and valid  offer  if  allowed
    back into the United Kingdom.  There is no evidence, notwithstanding  a
    claim to appreciate and understand the effect of offending, of any work
    being done by the appellant to deal with alcohol.   Indeed  it  appears
    that the evidence to the Judge was that the appellant claimed not to be
    alcoholic or addicted although he admits that  he  drinks.   Whether  a
    person who drinks is an alcoholic or  considers  themselves  to  be  an
    alcoholic when they are in fact an alcoholic, but they are  in  denial,
    is a very complex area,  but  the  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  the
    appellant has admitted that he does drink and there is no  evidence  he
    has taken any steps to seek professional help to avoid drinking in  the
    future or limit his drinking.   There  are  clearly  concerns  that  an
    identified risk factor still exists.

19.  In relation to anger management, the Judge makes no observation in  his
    determination of any steps  that  have  been  taken  to  address  anger
    management  issues  and  indeed  there  is  nothing  before   me   that
    satisfactorily  shows  that  the  anger  management  issues  have  been
    resolved.  It is therefore a case in which although the  assessment  is
    of low risk of offending, when looking at the evidence  in  the  round,
    the appellant has failed to adequately address  the  factors  that  may
    lead to reoffending.  I find the Secretary of State has established  on
    the facts of this matter that there is a genuine and  serious  risk  of
    reoffending, based upon the appellant's personal  conduct,  that  gives
    rise to concerns  regarding  the  public  security  and  public  policy
    aspects relied upon by the Secretary of State vis-�-vis the  safety  of
    members of society.

20.  Having found that  there  is  therefore  a  proven  real  risk  to  the
    required standard of reoffending, it is now necessary for me,  pursuant
    to Regulation 21(6), to assess the  proportionality  of  the  decision,
    that being proportionality  in  relation  to  EU  law,  i.e.  is  it  a
    proportionate decision required to  achieve  the  aims  sought  by  the
    Secretary of State when weighed against the rights the appellant has as
    an EU national of free movement within the European Union.   It  is  my
    finding on that point that it is  a  proportionate  response.   I  have
    taken into account the age of the appellant,  born  13  September  1984
    aged approximately 31, his state of health as  an  individual  in  good
    health, family and economic situation  which  I  have  referred  to  by
    reference to paragraph 38(g) and (h)  of  the  original  determination,
    length of residence in the United Kingdom, the appellant entered  claim
    to have entered on the 7 December 2012 and was only here  for  a  short
    period of time prior to his offending and appeal.  He has not  been  in
    the United Kingdom for a period of five years, does not have a right of
    permanent residence and  it  is  therefore  only  the  lower  stage  of
    protection that this  court  is  looking  at.   Issues  of  social  and
    cultural integration into the UK referred to at  paragraphs  38(g)  and
    (h) I have mentioned above, and the extents of the appellants links  to
    Poland.  This is a case of an individual who was not  fully  integrated
    into the United Kingdom, who retains ties to his home  state,  and  for
    whom it has not been shown that any unnecessary or undue hardship would
    be suffered if returned to Poland.

21.  In relation to the  question  of  rehabilitation,  there  have  been  a
    number of recent decisions with regard to rehabilitation, the  case  of
    Wozniak and Others which I referred to earlier, having  been  heard  by
    the Court of Appeal in 2015, then led to a  further  decision  by  this
    Tribunal in the case of MC (Essa principles recast) Poland [2015]  UKUT
    520 IAC in which it was held by the Upper Tribunal as follows:

         "1.  Essa rehabilitation principles are specific to decisions taken
             on public policy, public security and  public  health  grounds
             under Regulation 21 of the 2006 EEA Regulations.


         2.   It is only if the personal conduct of the person concerned  is
             found to represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious
             threat affecting one of the fundamental interests  of  society
             (Regulation 21(5)(c)) that it  becomes  relevant  to  consider
             whether the decision is proportionate taking into account  all
             the considerations identified in Regulation 21(5)-(6).


         3.   There is no specific reference in the expulsion provisions  of
             either Directive 2004/38/EC or the  2006  EEA  Regulations  to
             rehabilitation, but it has been seen by the Court  of  Justice
             as an aspect of integration,  which  is  one  of  the  factors
             referred to in Article 28(1) and Regulation 21(6) (Essa [2013]
             at paragraph [23]).


         4.   Rehabilitation is not an issue to be addressed  in  every  EEA
             deportation or removal decision taken under Regulation 21;  it
             will not be  relevant,  for  example,  if  rehabilitation  has
             already been completed (Essa [2013] at paragraphs [32]-[33]).


         5.   Reference to prospects of rehabilitation  concerns  reasonable
             prospects of a person ceasing to commit crime (Essa [2013]  at
             paragraph [35]), not the mere possibility  of  rehabilitation.
             Mere capability of rehabilitation is not to  be  equated  with
             reasonable prospect of rehabilitation.


         6.   Where relevant (see (4) above) such prospects are a factor  to
             be  taken  into  account  in  the  proportionality  assessment
             required by Regulation 21(5) and (6) ((Dumliauskas at [41]).


         7.   Such prospects are to be taken into account even if not raised
             by the offender (Dumliauskas [52]).


         8.    Gauging  such  prospects  requires  assessing  the   relative
             prospects of  rehabilitation  in  the  host  Member  State  as
             compared with those in the Member State of origin, but, in the
             absence of evidence, it is not to be  assumed  that  prospects
             are  materially  different  in   that   other   Member   State
             (Dumliauskas [46], paragraphs  [52]-[53] and [59]).


         9.   Matters that are relevant when examining the prospects of  the
             rehabilitation  of   offenders   include   family   ties   and
             responsibilities,    accommodation,    education,    training,
             employment, active membership of  a  community  and  the  like
             (Essa [2013] at paragraph [34]).  However, lack of access to a
             probation officer or equivalent  in  the  other  Member  State
             should not, in general, preclude deportation  (Dumliauskas  at
             [55])


         10.  In the  absence  of  integration  and  a  right  of  permanent
             residence, the future prospects of  integration  cannot  be  a
             weighty factor (Dumliauskas at [44] and [54]).  Even when such
             prospects have significant weight they are not a  trump  card,
             as what the Directive and the 2006 EEA Regulations require  is
             a wide-ranging holistic assessment.  Both recognise  that  the
             more serious the risk of reoffending, and the offences that  a
             person may commit, the greater the right to interfere with the
             right of residence (Dumliauskas at [46] and [54])."


22.  In relation to this matter, the appellant does  not  have  a  permanent
    right of residence.  He has only been in the United Kingdom  for  three
    years.   Although  there  is  no  evidence  provided  in  relation   to
    facilities available in Poland, it is reasonable to  assume  that  they
    are similar to those in the United Kingdom.  The finding that I make in
    relation  to  the  rehabilitation  issue,  which  forms  part  of   the
    proportionality assessment, is that there are equal prospects in Poland
    and the United Kingdom.  It has not been shown that suitable facilities
    are not available that may  be  required  to  meet  the  needs  of  the
    appellant vis-�-vis rehabilitation in Poland if he bothered to seek the
    same.  There is however no evidence that he has  taken  any  action  to
    seek the assistance of professional organisations to address  the  risk
    factors since his return to Poland or in the UK.

23.  For that reason I find that the decision is proportionate.

Decision

    I dismiss Mr Jurkowski's appeal against the decision to deport him from
    the United Kingdom.

    No anonymity direction is made.
