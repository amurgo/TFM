                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    For the sake of continuity I will refer to the parties  as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

2.    The appellant entered the UK on 31 January 2011 with  leave  to  enter
    as a student that was valid until 31 May 2014.  On  13  March  2014  he
    applied to vary and extend his leave to remain on the  ground  that  he
    was  married  to  a  British  citizen.  The  respondent   refused   the
    application in a decision dated 01 May 2014 on the sole ground that the
    English language certificate he produced (EMDQ) was not one  recognised
    by the Secretary of State and therefore didn't meet the requirements of
    paragraph E-LTRP.4.1 of Appendix FM of the immigration  rules.  In  the
    alternative, the respondent refused  the  application  under  paragraph
    EX.1 of Appendix FM on the ground that  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles preventing the couple from continuing their  family  life  in
    Bangladesh.

3.    First-tier Tribunal Judge Eldridge allowed the appeal  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 20 May 2015. The First-tier Tribunal Judge ("the judge")
    noted that it was not disputed  that  the  couple  were  in  a  genuine
    relationship [8 & 13]. He outlined  the  evidence  he  heard  from  the
    witnesses as to their family and private lives in the UK [13-15]. While
    he accepted that the appellant's wife had never been to Bangladesh  and
    may face  "considerable  difficulties"  there  he  concluded  that  the
    circumstances  were  not   sufficiently   compelling   to   amount   to
    "insurmountable  obstacles"  for  the  purpose  of  paragraph  EX.1  of
    Appendix FM of the  immigration  rules  [18].  He  concluded  that  the
    appellant did not meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)
    because there was  no  evidence  to  show  that  he  would  face  "very
    significant obstacles" to return.

4.    The judge went on to consider whether  there  were  any  circumstances
    that might engage the operation of Article 8  outside  the  immigration
    rules. He took into account the decision in R (on  the  application  of
    Chen  v  SSHD  (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -  temporary  separation  -
    proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 in which the Tribunal found that
    even if there were no insurmountable obstacles to a  couple  continuing
    their  family  life  outside  the  UK   there   may   occasionally   be
    circumstances where removal would still be  disproportionate  [21].  In
    considering the "public interest question" the judge  referred  himself
    to the factors outlined in section 117B of the Nationality, Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002. He gave weight to the  fact  that  it  is  in  the
    public interest to maintain an effective system of immigration control.
    Although the applicant did not submit an English  language  certificate
    issued by a recognised provider he took judicial  notice  of  the  fact
    that the appellant "had an excellent command  of  English".  The  judge
    also took into account  the  fact  that  the  couple  were  financially
    independent and had a combined  income  of  �24,000  a  year.  He  also
    considered the fact that their relationship was formed at a  time  when
    the appellant was in the UK lawfully [22].

5.    The judge then stepped back to consider the circumstances as a  whole.
    He noted that the only  reason  for  refusal  was  the  fact  that  the
    appellant did not  submit  an  English  language  certificate  from  an
    approved provider. However, he took into  account  the  fact  that  the
    appellant clearly did speak good English (having heard and assessed his
    evidence). He noted the  difficulties  that  his  wife  would  have  in
    earning the full financial requirement alone if the  appellant  had  to
    return to Bangladesh and apply for entry clearance from abroad [23]. He
    took into account the guidance given by the Court of Appeal in  SSHD  v
    SS (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and reminded himself that  there  needed
    to  be  compelling  circumstances  to  show  that  removal   would   be
    unjustifiably harsh [25]. He concluded that this was one of  the  small
    minority  of  cases  where  the  consequences  of  removal   would   be
    unjustifiably harsh. He weighed all the circumstances as  a  whole  and
    concluded  that  removal  in  consequence  of  the  decision  would  be
    disproportionate in all the circumstances of this particular case [27].



6.    The respondent seeks  to  challenge  the  decision  on  the  following
    grounds:

    "2.    The Judge found [paragraph 18] that there were no insurmountable
         obstacles to family life continuing in Bangladesh, but went  on  to
         find that the Appellant's removal would be  disproportionate  [27].
         In  reaching  this  conclusion,  the  Judge  finds  [20]  that  the
         Appellant cannot succeed under the  rules.  He  goes  on  to  find,
         however, [23] that 'the Appellant did not provide evidence  of  his
         ability in English the approved form but he has  good  English.  He
         and his wife currently meet the financial requirements of  a  gross
         income of at least �18,600"

    3.     The Upper Tribunal found in  the  case  of  AM  (S.117B)  Malawi
         [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) that 'If it was the intention of  Parliament
         that the requirements of the  immigration  rules  should  be  over-
         ridden, merely because an individual could establish that they were
         able to speak English, or were  financially  independent,  to  some
         degree, then we are satisfied that Parliament would have said so in
         the clearest terms' [14].

    4.     In allowing the appeal, the Judge has placed undue weight to the
         matters referred to above in overcoming the strong interests of the
         State in maintaining effective immigration control. In so doing, he
         has erred in law."

Decision and reasons

7.    After having considered the grounds of appeal  and  oral  arguments  I
    satisfied that the First-tier Tribunal decision  did  not  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

8.    The First-tier Tribunal Judge concluded that  the  appellant  did  not
    meet the strict requirements of the immigration  rules.  In  accordance
    with the two stage test outlined in cases such as  SSHD  v  SS  (Congo)
    [2015] EWCA Civ 387 and MF (Nigeria) v SSHD [2014] 2  All  ER  543  the
    judge turned to  consider  Article  8  outside  the  rules.  The  judge
    accepted that the  appellant  and  his  wife  were  in  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship. He was required by operation of the  statutory
    provisions contained in section 117B of the NIAA  2002  to  consider  a
    list of factors (where relevant) when assessing what weight to place on
    "the public  interest  question"  under  Article  8(2).  Those  factors
    include the question of whether the appellant speaks  English  (section
    117B(2)) and is financially self-sufficient (section 117B(3)). The fact
    that the judge considered those matters was entirely in accordance with
    the statute and cannot be criticised.

9.    The main thrust of the respondent's argument  is  that  little  weight
    should have been placed on those matters in light of the decision in AM
    (S.117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT  0260.  It  is  correct  to  say  that  the
    Tribunal concluded that the issue of whether someone speaks English  or
    is financially self-sufficient would not be given  positive  weight  in
    the balancing exercise but those factors do have some  significance  to
    the question of what weight should be placed on  "the  public  interest
    question" otherwise they would not have been included in  the  list  of
    factors that a court or tribunal must consider.

10.   In this case the judge gave adequate reasons to  explain  why  he  did
    not consider the fairly stringent test contained in paragraph EX.1  was
    met  in  relation  to   "insurmountable  obstacles"  but   nevertheless
    concluded  that  the  appellant's   wife   would   face   "considerable
    difficulties"  if  she  had  to  live  with  him  in  Bangladesh.   The
    respondent argues that in light of  that  finding  there  would  be  no
    interference with family life. However, the judge directed  himself  to
    case law to support the proposition that there may be a small  minority
    of cases where the threshold for "insurmountable obstacles" is not  met
    but removal would nevertheless be disproportionate. He made clear  that
    the test of "compelling circumstances" outlined by the Court of  Appeal
    in SS (Congo) was at the  forefront  of  his  mind  in  coming  to  his
    decision.

11.   I find that the judge was entitled to take into account the nature  of
    the very narrow reasons for refusal in assessing what weight  to  place
    on the public interest. The respondent accepted that the appellant  met
    all the other requirements of the rules for leave to remain as a spouse
    save for the  fact  that  the  English  language  certificate  that  he
    produced was not issued by an approved  provider.  The  requirement  to
    speak English is a public interest factor that underpins that  part  of
    the rules. It is also included in the  list  of  factors  contained  in
    section 117B when assessing Article 8 outside the rules. The fact  that
    a person does not speak English is likely to act as a  negative  factor
    because, as section 117B(2) suggests, the person is more likely to be a
    burden on taxpayers and would be less able to integrate into society.

12.   The fact that a person speaks English is not a matter  that  would  be
    given positive weight in the case of  an  applicant  whose  private  or
    family life was established at a time when he was remaining in  the  UK
    without leave or  whose  immigration  status  was  precarious.  Section
    117B(4) states that little weight should be placed on a relationship if
    formed at a time when the person is in the UK  unlawfully  and  section
    117B(5) states that little weight should be given  to  a  private  life
    established  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration  status   is
    precarious. Neither  of  those  sections  applied  in  this  case.  The
    appellant met his wife and established their  relationship  at  a  time
    when he had lawful leave to  remain.  Nothing  in  section  117B  would
    suggest that appropriate weight should not be given to the family  life
    that they have established in the UK. In  these  circumstances  I  find
    that in assessing what weight should be placed on the  public  interest
    in maintaining an effective system of immigration control the judge was
    entitled to take into account, as a matter of fact, that the  appellant
    speaks  good  English  and  that  the  public  interest  question  that
    underpins  the  requirement  contained  in  paragraph  E-LTRP.4.1   had
    nevertheless been satisfactorily addressed.

13.   I find that the judge conducted a careful and thorough  assessment  of
    the facts of the case and directed himself  properly  to  the  relevant
    rules, statutory framework and case law. He considered  the  particular
    circumstances of the case as a whole and came to  the  conclusion  that
    there were sufficiently compelling circumstances to render  removal  in
    consequence of the decision disproportionate. While another  judge  may
    have come to a different conclusion on the same facts  and  evidence  I
    find that the judge's proportionality assessment was  not  outside  the
    range of reasonable responses. The decision could not be  described  as
    irrational and does not otherwise disclose a material error of law.

14.   I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making of an  error  on
a point of law

The First-tier Tribunal decision shall stand
