                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Thorne, promulgated on 25th April 2014, following  a  hearing  at
    Hatton Cross on 9th  April  2014.   In  the  determination,  the  judge
    allowed the appeal of Mr Kassim Shehe.   The  Respondent  Secretary  of
    State, subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male and a citizen of Kenya.  He  was  born  on  3rd
    March 1989.  He appealed against the decision of the  Respondent  dated
    16th July 2013 to  refuse  him  entry  clearance  as  a  visitor  under
    paragraph 41 of HC 395 in order  to  visit  his  UK  Sponsor,  Mr  Adam
    Salkeld, with whom he is in a relationship.

The Judge's Findings

 3. In his witness statement, the Appellant states that he worked  for  the
    ICWE in a freelance capacity  since  2010,  and  that  "he  missed  the
    Sponsor and wanted to be able to visit him and his friends  and  family
    in the UK" (paragraph 19).  The judge also heard from the  Sponsor,  Mr
    Salkeld, and observed that, "I found him to be a  reliable  and  honest
    witness.  His account was inherently plausible,  internally  consistent
    and accorded with the available documentary evidence.  His  credibility
    was not challenged in cross-examination" (paragraph 20).

 4. The judge noted how the Sponsor had invited the Appellant to visit  him
    in the UK and that, "he said it was difficult  for  him  to  visit  the
    Appellant in Kenya because of work  commitments  in  the  UK  and  also
    because it was illegal to be  openly  gay  in  Kenya"  (paragraph  21).
    There was evidence before the judge that the Sponsor himself was a  man
    of substance, "earning about ï¿½100,000 a year.  He produced recent  HMRC
    tax returns and a letter from his  accountants  dated  1st  April  2014
    which  supported  what  he  said."   Moreover,  there  was  documentary
    evidence "of the fact that he owned properties  in  London  and  Wales"
    (paragraph 24).

 5. It was in these circumstances that the judge considered  the  law.   He
    observed that,

         "my task on an appeal on an ECHR ground against the decision of the
         primary official decision maker, refusing leave to enter or  remain
         in the UK, was  to  decide  whether  the  challenged  decision  was
         unlawful as incompatible with an ECHR right or  compatible  and  so
         lawful" (paragraph 29).

 6. The judge then went on to say that, "the first task  of  the  Appellate
    Immigration  Authority  was  to  establish  the  relevant  facts   ..."
    (paragraph 30).

 7. The judge then held that he was satisfied that, as far as the Appellant
    was concerned, "that at the time the ECO  took  the  decision,  he  was
    genuinely seeking entry as a visitor for the limited  period  specified
    and that he intended to leave the United Kingdom  at  the  end  of  the
    proposed visit" (paragraph 46).

 8. The judge also held that, "I accept the  Sponsor  is  in  a  subsisting
    relationship with the Appellant as claimed and  that  the  Sponsor  can
    provide sufficient accommodation and maintenance.   For  reasons  given
    above I found the Sponsor to be an honest  and  reliable  witness  ..."
    (paragraph 47).

 9. With respect to the Appellant himself  in  Kenya,  the  judge  observed
    that,

         "I am satisfied that the Appellant has sufficient  links  with  the
         home country so as to establish a motive to return.  I accept  that
         he is gainfully employed running his own freelance business on  the
         tourist industry of east Africa  and  that  he  has  no  motive  or
         intention to stay in the UK" (paragraph 48).

    The judge observed the letters from ICWE that backed up  the  story  of
    the Appellant with respect to his employment there.

10. It is in these circumstances that the judge concluded that, "it is pure
    speculation to say that this Appellant lacks a motive and intention  to
    return" because "he has every motive and intention  to  return  to  his
    family and business in Kenya" (paragraph 49).

11. There was one additional factor in favour of the Sponsor, namely,  that
    "he has successfully sponsored visitors to the UK before" and the judge
    is clear that, "there is in my judgment no reason to  suppose  that  he
    would allow this Appellant to overstay now" (paragraph 50).

12. The judge accordingly then proceeded, having established the facts,  to
    apply the provisions of ECHR to the facts and  to  consider  the  legal
    position in relation to the  Appellant's  alleged  rights  under  human
    rights law.  The judge concluded that, "the Appellant has a family  and
    private life with the Sponsor which requires  respect  under  the  ECHR
    ..." (paragraph 53).  The judge also referred to the case of  Chikwamba
    [2008] UKHL 40 to state that,

         "It seems to me that  refusing  the  Appellant's  appeal  in  these
         circumstances (where I am satisfied that he was a  genuine  visitor
         who could be maintained and accommodated without  a  drain  on  the
         public  purse)  and  requiring  him  to  reapply  would  be  wholly
         disproportionate and Kafkaesque in the extreme" (paragraph 54).

13. The appeal was allowed.

Grounds of Application

14. The grounds of application state that the appeal was  under  Article  8
    only but the judge made findings of fact  as  if  considerations  under
    paragraph 41 of the Immigration  Rules  remained  in  issue,  and  this
    amounted to an error of law.  Secondly, the  grounds  stated  that  any
    reasoning  in  the  determination  justifying  consideration   of   the
    Appellant's Article  8  rights  outside  the  provisions  contained  in
    Appendix FM of the Rules had to first satisfy the requirements set down
    in Gulshan, and the judge showed no evidence of this.

15. A Rule 24 response was entered dated 26th November 2014, by Mr Yeo.  It
    is measured and well crafted.  It clearly states that  no  identifiable
    or comprehensive error of law  has  actually  been  identified  in  the
    Grounds of Appeal.  The judge's factual findings are unchallenged.  The
    judge had not allowed the appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    judge allowed the appeal under Article 8 ECHR.

The Hearing

16. At the hearing before me, Mr Yeo helpfully handed up the  latest  Upper
    Tribunal determination in  this  area,  namely,  the  case  of  Mustafa
    (Article 8 in entry clearance) [2015] UKUT  00112.   Mr  Yeo  submitted
    that a copy of this had been sent last week to the Respondent Secretary
    of State.  Ms Kenny confirmed that she had a copy of this decision.  It
    was, however, Ms Kenny's appeal on behalf of the  Respondent  Secretary
    of State.  She addressed both of the Grounds of Appeal in  her  initial
    application.

17. First, she submitted that following  the  new  Rules  with  respect  to
    visitors, the only way that an appeal could be  allowed  would  be  for
    breach of human rights or discrimination law.  The judge was  aware  of
    this.  He set out at paragraph 28  that,  "I  can  only  consider  this
    appeal by reference to Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights".  The judge also went on at paragraph 31 to  then  specifically
    refer to Article 8 and  the  issue  of  proportionality.   However,  in
    making his findings of fact, the judge then has regard to paragraph  41
    of HC 395 considerations that are specific to what is required  by  the
    Immigration Rules.  For example, the judge  states  (at  paragraph  46)
    that, "he was genuinely seeking entry as  a  visitor  for  the  limited
    period specified".

18. Second, these considerations are not  relevant,  and  cannot  inform  a
    decision to allow the appeal, under Article 8 of the ECHR.   It  is  in
    this context that the judge then goes on to apply the  House  of  Lords
    decision in Chikwamba, and to say that, "he is and was always a genuine
    visitor who could be maintained and accommodated ...".  The  judge  was
    plainly influenced by the Immigration Rules and should not  have  been.
    This was a human rights appeal under the ECHR.

19. Third, if the judge was then  going  to  look  at  the  position  under
    Article 8 ECHR, then, as Gulshan makes clear, he  had  to  be  able  to
    demonstrate why it was necessary to go outside the Immigration Rules so
    as to be allowing the appeal under freestanding Article 8  ECHR.   This
    the judge had not been able to do.

20. For his part, Mr Yeo submitted that the  reasoning  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of  State,  as  submitted  by  Ms  Kenny,  was  confused  and
    convoluted.  On the one hand it was being said that the Rules were  not
    relevant and ought not to have been taken into account.  On  the  other
    hand, it is said that the Rules should have been the primary focus, and
    only if the appeal did not  succeed  under  the  Rules,  could  one  go
    outside the Rules and look at freestanding Article 8 jurisprudence, but
    that in that event, one would need  to  be  able  to  show  exceptional
    circumstances and a proper justification, for allowing the appeal under
    Article 8.  None of this, submitted Mr Yeo, made sense.

21. The proper approach was set out by the Upper Tribunal in Mustafa, where
    UTJ Perkins, in anticipating the rule changes that were  to  come  into
    effect on 6th April 2015, explains how human rights appeals are  to  be
    considered in visitor cases.  What  that  case  makes  clear  is  that,
    whereas an appeal  cannot  be  allowed  under  the  Immigration  Rules,
    because appeal rights have now been  removed  for  visitors  under  the
    Immigration Rules, where a judge proceeds to  allow  the  appeal  under
    Article 8 ECHR,

         "the claimant's ability to satisfy the Immigration Rules is not the
         question to be determined by the Tribunal, but is capable of  being
         a weighty, though not determinative, factor when  deciding  whether
         such a refusal is proportionate to the legitimate aim of  enforcing
         immigration control".

    That was made clear in the head note.  It was salutary to  bear  it  in
    mind, submitted Mr Yeo.

22. Second, any suggestion that the  Appellant  had  to  show  "exceptional
    circumstances" was misconceived, because, as Mustafa  makes  clear,  if
    the Appellant met the Immigration Rules, though an appeal could not  be
    allowed under the Immigration Rules, this was a  relevant  factor  that
    went directly to the "proportionality" of  the  decision  in  question,
    such that it was superfluous then to embark  upon  a  consideration  of
    "exceptional circumstances".  In Mustafa, submitted Mr Yeo,  the  judge
    had made the mistake which the instant judge did not make.  In Mustafa,
    the judge allowed the appeal specifically under the Immigration  Rules.
    Judge Thorne, in this case, however, specifically  did  not  allow  the
    appeal under the Immigration Rules.  He allowed  it  under  Article  8.
    His decision was impeccable in its logic.

23. In reply, Ms Kenny submitted that Mustafa does not contradict the  case
    put forward by the Respondent Secretary of State.  For example, Mustafa
    makes it clear that there is a duty of "candour" upon the Appellant and
    that if an Appellant "had contributed to the application being  refused
    by presenting inaccurate information or by omitting something  material
    ..." then this would go  against  the  Appellant.   In  this  case  the
    Appellant did not submit all the documents in the first instance.  They
    were made available only at  the  appeal.   Moreover,  in  Mustafa  the
    Tribunal made it clear that the relationship had to be one that was not
    just "based on a whim" or was not one that "will not add  significantly
    to the time that the people involved spend  together"  (paragraph  24).
    In this case, the Sponsor could visit the Appellant in Kenya and so  it
    was unclear why Article 8 had to be engaged in the manner alleged.   Mr
    Yeo interjected to say that there had been no application to amend  the
    grounds and these were new points that were being raised.

No Error of Law

24. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCA 2007) such that I should set aside the decision.  My reasons are as
    follows.  The judge's approach in this determination is not only  clear
    and comprehensive, but is indeed impeccable in its logic in emphasising
    that the appeal cannot be allowed under the Immigration Rules,  because
    appeal rights have been removed  under  the  Rules,  but  can  only  be
    allowed under Article 8 ECHR.  The judge against this background,  then
    proceeds to make findings of fact.

25. In so doing, it is clear that these findings  of  fact  have  not  been
    challenged at all by the Respondent Secretary of State, but it is  also
    clear that the judge then finds that  the  balance  of  proportionality
    considerations fall in favour of the Appellant  because  the  Appellant
    "was genuinely seeking entry  as  a  visitor  for  the  limited  period
    specified" only (paragraph 46).  These are  considerations  that  arise
    from the Immigration Rules, but, are "capable of being weighty,  though
    not determinative,  factors  when  deciding  whether  such  refusal  is
    proportionate".

26. This  principle  arises  directly  from  the  Upper  Tribunal's  recent
    determination in Mustafa.  From 25th June 2013, Section 52 of the Crime
    and Courts Act  2013  has  amended  Section  88A  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, so that there is no  right  of  appeal
    against refusal of entry clearance in family visitor  cases  except  on
    grounds alleging that the decision shows unlawful discrimination or  is
    unlawful under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998.

27. In this case, Section 84(1)(c)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, has  been  amended  to  the  effect  that,  "that  the
    decision is unlawful under Section 6 of the Human Rights Act  1998  ...
    as being incompatible with the Appellant's Convention rights" before  a
    right of appeal will accrue.

28. The judge in this case was perfectly mindful of the legal  jurisdiction
    in which he was operating.  He also made findings of  fact  which  were
    not dissimilar to findings made in Mustafa.

29. In Mustafa, the Tribunal  held  that  the  claimant  husband,  who  was
    intending to visit his sponsoring wife  in  the  UK,  "has  shown  that
    refusing him entry clearance does interfere with his, and  his  wife's,
    private and family lives" and that "it will be necessary to assess  the
    evidence to see if the claimant meets the substance of the Rules.  This
    is because ...  the  ability  to  satisfy  the  Rules  illuminates  the
    proportionality  of  the  decision  to  refuse  him  entry   clearance"
    (paragraph 9).

30. In Mustafa, the Tribunal held that the denial of entry clearance "would
    have a significant impact on  the  claimant's  right  to  enjoy  family
    life", and that the claimant "had strong ties" with his  home  country,
    and that these ties were ones  "arising  from  his  being  in  regular,
    rewarding work and ... living there" (paragraph 10).  The same  has  as
    much been found by Judge Thorne with respect  to  the  Appellant.   The
    judge was entitled to do so.  The judgment by IJ Thorne ends  with  the
    observation that, "it will only be in very unusual circumstances"  that
    Article 8 will not be relevant when cases involve "close life  partners
    or a parent and a minor child" (paragraph 24).

31. Once the judge had found that the Appellant and the Sponsor were  in  a
    subsisting relationship and were close to  each  other  and  wanted  to
    continue in this relationship Article 8 became directly relevant.   The
    judge was entitled to conclude as he did.  There is  no  error  of  law
    here.

Notice of Decision

32. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The decision shall stand.

33. No anonymity direction is made.
