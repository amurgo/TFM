For the Appellant:     Mr Omoniruvbe, Counsel, instructed by Church Street
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The Appellant, a national of Nigeria, date of birth 30 September  1980,
    appealed against the Respondent's decision, dated 2  October  2014,  to
    refuse to issue a residence card  with  reference  to  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 (the 2006 Regulations) on the
    basis  that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not  satisfied  that   the
    Appellant's  Sponsor  was  a  qualified  person  for  the  purpose   of
    Regulation 6 of the 2006 Regulations.  Other issues were  raised  which
    are of no significance.

2.   The matter came before  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bird  who,  on  15
    September 2015, dismissed the appeal on the basis  that  the  Appellant
    had not adduced the necessary evidence to show that  on  a  balance  of
    probabilities the EEA Sponsor, Miss Romana G  Derby,  was  a  qualified
    person.

3.   On 29  February  2016,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  V  P  McDade  gave
    permission to appeal.  On 24 April 2016 I found the Original Tribunal's
    decision could not stand and the matter would require a resumed hearing
    in the Upper Tribunal.

4.   On 18 May  2016  prior  to  the  hearing  there  was  produced  by  JDS
    Solicitors an  accountant's  report  in  connection  with  EEA  Sponsor
    together with her tax return for the relevant period ended 5 April 2016
    in which evidence was submitted to  show  at  the  material  times  the
    Sponsor was exercising treaty rights.  Mr  Jarvis  confirmed  with  the
    Appellant's  accountants  by  telephone  speaking  with  the   relevant
    director as to production of the documents  and  as  to  the  Sponsor's
    income.

5.   In those circumstances Mr Jarvis was satisfied that  the  evidence  now
    showed that the Appellant did meet the  requirements  for  a  residence
    certificate with reference to Rule 17(1)(a) and  Regulation  6  of  the
    2006 Regulations that the Appellant was entitled to the residence  card
    sought.

6.     The Original Tribunal's decision under the 2006 Regulations  did  not
    stand. All other aspects of the Original Tribunal's decision stand.
          The following decision is substituted.
         The appeal is allowed under the 2006 Regulations.

Anonymity Order

7.   No anonymity order was sought and none is required.

Fee Award

8.   The position is that this appeal has now succeeded  through  the  later
    production of evidence required.  In  the  circumstances  therefore  it
    does not seem to me that a fee award in the sum of ï¿½140 is appropriate.



Signed                                  Date 22 May 2016
