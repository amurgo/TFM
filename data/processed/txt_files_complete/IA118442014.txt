                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  For ease  of  convenience
    I shall refer to  the  parties  as  the  Secretary  of  State  and  the
    appellant from the First-tier proceedings as the Claimant.

2.   The Claimant is Mrs T D who is a citizen of Thailand born on  1  August
    1979.  In a decision promulgated on 4 November 2014 by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Napthine)  the  Claimant's  application  for  leave  to
    remain as a spouse was dismissed under  the  Rules  but  allowed  under
    Article 8 ECHR.

3.   The reasons for refusal were that the Claimant  entered  the  UK  as  a
    visitor together with her daughter in 2013 and accordingly she was  not
    "eligible" under the Rules E-LTRP 2.1  to  make  an  application  as  a
    spouse.  Further she failed to provide "specified evidence" required to
    show her husband's  income  of  ï¿½23,000  per  annum  (Appendix  FM-SE).
    Further she failed to provide evidence to show that she met the English
    language requirements. The Secretary of  State  stated  that  no  final
    determination of whether or not the relevant income threshold  was  met
    pending the outcome of a legal challenge to  the  income  requirements.
    And in considering the language requirements, the test certificate  had
    not  been  verified  as  genuine  and  the   Claimant's   scores   were
    insufficient. It was  accepted  that  the  Claimant  had  a  subsisting
    relationship with her daughter who is a British citizen under  the  age
    of 7 years old.  However, she did not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules for eligibility nor under paragraph 276ADE.

4.   In the decision and reasons the Tribunal found that  the  Claimant  did
    not meet the Rules for the reasons relied on by the Secretary of  State
    [15], namely eligibility. However, it found that the Claimant otherwise
    met the Rules at the date of hearing. The Tribunal considered the claim
    outside of the Rules  having  regard  to  "  the  Gulshan  test  "  and
    considered Article 8 ECHR and thereafter Section 17 of the  Nationality
    Immigration & Asylum Act 2002 ("2002 Act") as  amended.   It  concluded
    that there were compelling circumstances and that it was not reasonable
    for the claimant to have to return to Thailand which  would  result  in
    separation from her daughter  in  order  to  make  an  out  of  country
    application, thus engaging Article 8.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted to  the  Secretary  of  State  on  the
    basis of detailed grounds.

Grounds

6.   Firstly, the Tribunal failed to properly assess  the  requirements  for
    specified evidence of finance at the time of  the  application  and  as
    such the findings are not sustainable.   Secondly,  the  Tribunal  made
    findings concerning the English language requirements  based  on  post-
    application evidence and at the time of the  application  the  claimant
    did not meet the Rules.  Thirdly, the Tribunal failed to  consider  the
    public interest in expecting applicants to apply under the correct  and
    applicable Rules and allowed Article 8 to be used as the  mechanism  to
    circumvent the Rules.  Fourthly, the Tribunal failed to consider if the
    circumstances of removal established that it  was  unjustifiably  harsh
    for the entire family to be separated.  There were  inadequate  reasons
    in this  regard.   There  was  no  consideration  of  circumstances  in
    Thailand where the couple had lived together and where the Claimant had
    lived with her daughter. There could be no legitimate  expectation  for
    them to live in the UK.  The Tribunal considered the best interests  of
    the child were to remain in the UK.

Submissions

7.   This morning I have heard submissions.   Mr  Parkinson  relies  on  the
    detailed grounds of appeal.  In summary he argues that  Article  8  has
    been used to circumvent the Rules. The Tribunal failed to give adequate
    reasons why Article 8  was  engaged.   Mr  Alim  relies  on  his  reply
    submitted under Rule 24 which is also very detailed.  He  submits  that
    the Tribunal was able to make findings under Article 8  as  to  finance
    and English language as at the date of the hearing,  in  light  of  the
    fact that  these  matters  had  not  been  finally  determined  by  the
    Secretary of State.  The appeal was premised on Article 8 ECHR and  the
    Tribunal relied on the principles established in Chikwamba which  still
    apply.  The interests of the child as a British citizen are for her  to
    remain in the UK with her mother, the Claimant.

Discussion and conclusions

8.   I have  decided  that  there  was  a  material  error  of  law  in  the
    Tribunal's decision.  The Tribunal erred in its consideration  both  of
    the Immigration Rules and Article 8 ECHR.   I  am  satisfied  that  the
    grounds of appeal relied on by the Secretary of State are made  out  in
    their entirety.  The Tribunal found that the Claimant and  her  husband
    married in the UK in 2010 and they  have  a  child  who  is  a  British
    citizen.  The Claimant entered as a visitor together  with  her  child.
    The Claimant was not eligible under the Rules relating to  private  and
    family life (which include EX.1) because she entered with  leave  as  a
    visitor.  Further she has failed to meet the requirements in the  Rules
    for  specified  evidence  for  finance   and   the   English   language
    requirements at the relevant time. Although reference is  made  in  the
    refusal letter to a final determination not  being  made,  this  factor
    ought not to have detracted from the Tribunal's correct conclusion that
    the appeal under the Rules failed at the time the application was  made
    and decided, the main reason being eligibility. However,  even  if  the
    rules were met at the date of hearing the  Claimant  had  not  met  the
    "Eligibility" requirement.

9.     I am  satisfied  that  the  Tribunal's  assessment  and  analysis  of
    Article 8 is flawed.  The Immigration Rules are intended to  cover  all
    circumstances of family and private life for entry and remaining in the
    UK.  The  grounds  rely  on  Gulshan  and  Nagre  however  as  held  in
    Ganesabalan, R(On the application of) v SSHD[2014]  EWHC  2712  (Admin)
    there is no prior threshold which  dictates  whether  the  exercise  of
    discretion should be considered; rather the nature  of  the  assessment
    and the reasoning which were called  for  were  informed  by  threshold
    considerations. The Tribunal here failed to give adequate  reasons  for
    considering Article 8 outside of the Rules.   In  assessing  Article  8
    ECHR the Tribunal must take into account the degree to which the  Rules
    have not been met rather than to reconsider  the  issues  afresh  under
    Article 8. The Immigration Rules are the important first stage and  the
    focus of Article 8 assessments. It will be  an  error  of  law  not  to
    address Article 8 by reference to the Rules.

10.   I am satisfied that the evidence  failed  to  show  any  unjustifiably
    harsh  consequences  for  the  family  and/or  that  the  refusal   was
    disproportionate by reference to its consequences under Article  8.   I
    see no basis for concluding that the decision is contrary to  the  best
    interest of the child, which is a primary consideration.  The  Claimant
    and her daughter lived in Thailand for some time prior to  their  visit
    in 2013 and although the parties married in the UK,  the  Claimant  has
    another daughter who also lives in Thailand.  The evidence relied on to
    establish where the best interests  of  the  child  lie  was  that  the
    Claimant's daughter is now in school and her father at work,  thus  the
    Claimant is the main  carer  for  the  child.  However,  there  was  no
    exploration by the Tribunal of why  the  Claimant  failed  to  make  an
    application for entry clearance as a spouse in the  first  place.   The
    Tribunal failed to consider the possibility of  the  family  living  in
    Thailand and the situation in that country for the child given that she
    previously lived there with her mother.  I can see no  reason  why  the
    Claimant cannot return with  her  daughter  to  Thailand  to  make  the
    appropriate application for leave which can be properly  considered  by
    the decision maker having regard to the relevant Rules.  Article  8  is
    not a mechanism to be used to circumvent the requirements of the Rules.
    In short the Tribunal failed to properly grapple with the  main  reason
    for refusal namely "Eligibility". Accordingly I allow the Secretary  of
    State's appeal.

Notice of Decision

10.  There is a material error of law in the decision.  The decision is  set
    aside.  I substitute a decision that the Claimant's appeal is dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.
