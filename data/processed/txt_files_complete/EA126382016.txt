For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Mali.  On 16 February 2009 he married  an
    EEA national in Mali.  Following his wife's  admission  to  the  UK  in
    2012, he was granted a residence card as the family member  of  an  EEA
    national valid from 26 April 2011 - 26 April 2016.  The couple divorced
    in Mali on 5 February 2015.  On 7 April 2016 he applied for a permanent
    residence card as confirmation of a retained right to reside in the  UK
    following divorce.  The respondent  accepted  that  the  appellant  had
    divorced and that his marriage had lasted for at least three years  and
    that he and his former spouse had resided in the UK for  at  least  one
    year during their marriage.  The  respondent  also  accepted  that  the
    appellant had demonstrated that he had been  in  employment  since  the
    date of the divorce.  However, the respondent refused  his  application
    because she was not satisfied (i) that his former spouse was exercising
    Treaty rights at the date of divorce; or (ii) that  his  former  spouse
    had shown she was continuously working for a period of five years.

2.   The appellant appealed.  The evidence produced by the appellant at  the
    hearing included an accountant's report from Northwest Associates dated
    10 October 2015 showing a schedule of profit of �10,076 for year  ended
    5 April 2015.  In a decision sent on 2 October 2017 Judge Graham of the
    First-tier Tribunal (FtT) dismissed his appeal; broadly  for  the  same
    reasons given by the respondent for refusing his application.

3.   The appellant's grounds of appeal  can  be  classified  as  essentially
    threefold. They stated first of all that the judge  had  erred  in  not
    accepting the former wife's evidence of self-employment during  2014/5.
    In this regard it was pointed out  that  the  judge  held  against  the
    appellant the lack of a P60, which was not a document  a  self-employed
    person possesses.  The grounds contend, secondly, that the judge  erred
    in criticising the appellant's former  spouse's  employment  activities
    between 2011 and 2014 as "marginal and ancillary" -  having  regard  to
    Suraya Begum [2011] UKUT 00259 (IAC).  The grounds contend thirdly that
    the judge erred in finding that the appellant had not shown that he was
    working at the date of decision.

4.   It is convenient to take the  grounds  in  reverse  order,  taking  the
    third ground first.  Whilst the judge was correct to identify that  the
    appellant had not produced recent payslips to demonstrate he was  still
    employed, no issue had been taken by the respondent to show  he  failed
    to meet  the  requirements  of  regulation  10(5)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations and so the appellant had not  been
    put on notice of the need to produce up-to-date evidence.  Hence it was
    wrong of the judge, without giving the appellant proper opportunity  to
    produce up-to-date evidence to hold its  lack  against  the  appellant.
    The  appellant  has   now   produced   documentary   evidence   clearly
    demonstrating that he was continuing in  employment  at  the  date  off
    hearing.  In light of that Mr Richards sensibly conceded that the judge
    was in error on this point but argued that it  was  a  not  a  material
    error unless the appellant could demonstrate legal error in the judge's
    other main findings. Mr Haq did not demur.

5.   Turning to the  appellant's  second  ground,  I  consider  the  judge's
    assessment at paragraph 14 that the ex-spouse's employment from between
    tax years 2011 - 2014 was "marginal  and  ancillary,  especially  2011"
    (when the account showed a little over 2,000) to be   contrary  to  the
    evidence.  Whatever the  precise  position  as  regards  continuity  (a
    matter I will deal with separately  below),  the  documentary  evidence
    provided by the appellant included his former spouse's P60s  for  three
    tax years ending 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 in the last three of which  her
    earnings were recorded as being over �6,000.   Such  a  record  is  not
    consistent with employment undertaken being marginal and ancillary. The
    fact that the  income  was  concluded  by  the  judge  to  be  low  and
    reflective of limited working hours was insufficient to show  that  the
    economic activity was marginal or ancillary.

6.   It remains common ground that the appellant could  only  succeed  under
    the Regulations if  able  to  show  (i)  that  his  former  spouse  was
    exercising Treaty rights at the time of the divorce; and (ii) that  she
    had been exercising treaty rights continuously for a five year  period.
    As regards (i), the judge stated at paragraph 12:

         "12. I make the following findings.  I am satisfied  the  Appellant
             cannot meet the 2006 Regulations for permanent  residence  for
             the following reasons.   At  the  date  of  divorce  there  is
             insufficient evidence before me to show that the  EEA  sponsor
             was employed and receiving an income from self employment as a
             hairdresser.  The only evidence before me is in the form of an
             income statement and a HMRC tax return showing  that  the  tax
             payable was paid late.  There is no P60 for  2014-2015,  there
             are no bank statements or business transactions of any type to
             show that she was receiving any form of income."

     This brings into focus the appellant's first ground of appeal.

7.   I agree with the appellant that  the  judge's  reasoning  here  betrays
    misunderstanding, at least insofar as the judge in  para  12  meant  to
    assess the appellant's  evidence  of  self-employment.   However,  this
    paragraph has to be read together with paragraph 8 in which  the  judge
    stated:


         "8.  He accepted that he was unable to submit  all  of  his  former
             spouse's wage slips for  the  relevant  period.   However,  he
             referred  to  a  document  from  her   accountant,   Northwest
             Associates (Appellant's bundle at 1) which showed that at  the
             time of divorce, she was a  self-employed  hair  dresser.   He
             said she began this self employment in  2014.   The  Appellant
             accepted that the only evidence of her self-employment was  an
             income statement (page 4) for the year ending  the  5th  April
             2015, and the receipt from HMRC (page 3) which showed that the
             tax payable figure (on page 10) of �206.20 was paid on the 9th
             August 2017."

8.   This shows that the judge did not  overlook  the  full  extent  of  the
    evidence relied on by the appellant to prove his wife's self-employment
    since the end of the 2013-2014 tax year.  In particular, it shows  that
    the judge clearly did take fully into account  the  document  from  her
    accountants, Northwest Associates stating that she was a  self-employed
    hairdresser.  It was open to the judge to assess that this evidence did
    not demonstrate self-employment at a  level  sufficient  to  constitute
    exercise of Treaty  rights,  since  the  accountant's  letter  was  not
    supported by any bank statements or business transactions of  any  type
    to show that she was receiving any of  the  income  mentioned,  in  the
    accountant's letter.  I remind myself that an accountant's  letter  can
    only be based on figures provided by a client and  in  the  absence  of
    annexures referencing specific amounts paid to the  appellant,  such  a
    letter cannot self-prove the actual activity of self-employment.

9.   In  the  absence  of  any  error  in  the  judge's  assessment  of  the
    appellant's former wife's self-employment from April 2014  onwards,  it
    is clear that he could not show she had been continuously employed  for
    a five-year period prior to the couple's divorce in February 2015.

10.  For the above reasons, I conclude that despite the judge  falling  into
    error in limited respects in relation to the appellant's  own  and  his
    former wife's history of employment, these had no  material  impact  on
    the judge's reasons for concluding that the appellant  could  not  meet
    the requirements of regulation 10 in full.

11.  Accordingly the judge's decision shall stand.

12.  No anonymity direction is made.
