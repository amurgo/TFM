                    NOTICE RECORDING WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL

1.   This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, First-tier Judge Handley,  sitting  at  Hatton
    Cross on 6 August 2014, by which in a  determination  dated  19  August
    2014 he allowed the appeals of the  appellants  under  the  Immigration
    Rules.  Suffice it to say that Mr Bramble,  very  helpfully  and  quite
    properly, has taken me  to  relevant  passages  in  the  materials;  in
    particular, the certificate  of  sponsorship  document,  which  plainly
    indicates that the judge was entitled to reach the conclusion he did at
    paragraph 22 of his determination.

2.   It has to be said that,  in  matters  of  this  kind,  extremely  close
    scrutiny of a range of different legislative  and  other  documents  is
    usual.  For that reason, I can understand the way in  which  this  case
    has come before the Upper Tribunal today.  However, it is manifest that
    there is no error in the  determination  and,  in  light  of  that,  Mr
    Bramble has withdrawn the Secretary of State's appeal  against  it.   I
    will therefore formally record the appeal of the Secretary of State  as
    withdrawn,  which  means  that  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal stands.



                               Signed   Date 19 December 2014


                               Upper Tribunal Judge Peter Lane
