Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will  refer  to  the
    original appellant, a citizen of China born on 15 February 1963, as the
    appellant herein.

2.   She entered the United Kingdom on 9  July  2012  with  leave  until  12
    September 2014.  She applied for indefinite leave to remain on 23  June
    2014 on the basis of her marriage to a British citizen,  Mr  Cai.   The
    couple had married in China on 15 February 1983.  Mr Cai had left China
    in 2000 and had been granted settlement  on  13  August  2010  and  was
    subsequently naturalised as a British citizen.

3.   In her application were two City and Guilds Certificates. One  was  for
    an entry level certificate in ESOL International (Reading, Writing  and
    Listening) (Achiever B1) for which the appellant was shown as having  a
    pass at B1 in reading and listening and a first-class pass in  writing.
    That certificate was dated 8 March 2014. A second certificate, dated 11
    March 2014, showed the appellant having achieved a first-class pass  in
    spoken ESOL. It was further demonstrated that she had passed  the  Life
    in the UK Test on 25 April 2014.  This pass had been  notified  by  the
    authorised provider, "LearnDirect".

4.   The appellant's marriage, maintenance and  accommodation  were  not  in
    issue. However problems  arose  when  the  appellant  was  summoned  to
    interview in February 2015. She lived in Folkestone and  the  interview
    was in Liverpool.  The time of the  interview  was  not  shown  on  the
    interview notes. It was not clear how long the  interview  lasted.  The
    judge summarised what was contained in the interview record as follows:

         "10.  The interview record comprises as number of  boxes.  One  box
             contains  a  brief  introduction  and  at   question   2   the
             interviewer is to ask whether the applicant can  hear  him  or
             her clearly and able to understand  him  or  her.  The  answer
             given in manuscript is 'No' and then it  is  followed  by  the
             words 'Cannot speak English'.


         11.  Questions 9 to 15 are bracketed together in manuscript and the
             words added "No response/cannot speak English'.  Question  17,
             in a separate box, asks about the Life in the  UK  Test   took
             place and this is annotated with the words  'No  English'  and
             this is repeated at question 20 when asking  where  and  where
             the appellant took a language test  previously.   In  response
             at question 27 there is a manuscript note  that  is  partially
             illegible but says 'No response' and the same applies  to  the
             next question as to whether or not  the  applicant  wishes  to
             answer any questions.  She signed the interview notes."

5.   The Secretary of State refused the appellant's application  on  11  May
    2015.  In relation to the English language certificates she stated:

         "... However  following  an  interview  on  8  March  2015  it  was
         concluded that it  was  not  credible  that  you  had  successfully
         achieved entry level certificate in ESOL International   (Entry  3)
         ESOL certificate at Whitechapel College because you did not respond
         to any of the questions you were asked regarding the course because
         you could not speak English.  The Secretary of State  is  therefore
         satisfied that there is substantial evidence to conclude  that  the
         certificate produced was fraudulently obtained."

6.    The  Secretary  of  State  refused  the  application  under  paragraph
    322(1)(A)  on  this  basis  and  further  refused  the  application  by
    reference to paragraph 287(A) of  the   Immigration  Rules  relying  on
    subparagraphs (vi) and  (vii).   The  appellant  had  not  demonstrated
    sufficient knowledge of the English language and knowledge  about  life
    in the United Kingdom and fell for refusal under  the  general  grounds
    for refusal.   Under Appendix FM the  appellant  came  up  against  the
    hurdle  set  by  S-LTR.2.2.  which   refers   to   false   information,
    representations or documents submitted in relation to the  application.
    In relation to paragraph EX.1 of Appendix FM  the respondent found that
    while the appellant claimed to reside with her husband  in  the  United
    Kingdom they had no children  in  this  country  and  had  provided  no
    evidence "of insurmountable obstacles to your  family  life  continuing
    overseas".

7.   The appellant appealed against the decision and her appeal came  before
    First-tier Judge Pullig on 11 January 2016.  The judge  heard  evidence
    from both the appellant and her husband.  The  judge  records  how  the
    appellant described engaging in a language training programme which she
    completed and was successful in her English  language  course  and  her
    representatives  were  instructed  to  pursue   her   application   for
    settlement in June 2014. However in February  2015  some  eight  months
    later, she was asked to attend the interview in Liverpool  on  8  March
    2015.   The judge records that she was  very  tired  by  the  time  she
    arrived and was unfamiliar with Liverpool.  The judge adds:

         "She felt alienated and uncomfortable in the Home  Office  premises
         and before then she had become less proficient with her English and
         listening abilities as she had not been  using it  much  since  she
         had completed her language course more than a year earlier. She was
         nervous and unable to focus at her interview  and  this  undermined
         her ability to answer questions."

8.   At the time of the hearing she said her knowledge of  the  English  was
    presently minimal. She rarely spoke  English  with  her  husband.   Her
    husband gave evidence and said he never spoke English to his wife.

9.   The  Presenting  Officer  submitted  that  as  the  appellant  had  not
    answered any questions in English she  could  not  have  completed  the
    course and passed the test "rather than having lost English  after  she
    had undertaken such a test one would have expected her English to  have
    improved". The appellant's representative (not Mr Bazini) submitted  it
    was entirely credible given her age  that  she  could   have  lost  her
    English and slipped  up  on  the  matter  and  there  was  insufficient
    evidence in any event of fraud.

10.  The judge reminded himself that the burden  of  proof  of  establishing
    fraud lay on the Secretary of State.

11.  Having addressed the Rules  relating  to  English  language  tests  the
    judge notes that no point had  been  taken  on  the  providers  of  the
    English language certificates but what had been challenged was  whether
    the certificates were  obtained  by  fraud.  The  judge  concluded  his
    determination as follows:

         "48.     First I find that the appellant and her husband are honest
             witnesses and I believe their evidence.


         49.      Looking at the  interview  notes  it  is  not  clear  what
             questions were actually asked and whether the  appellant  said
             that she could not  speak  English  or  such  was  merely  the
             conclusion of the interviewing officer.


         50.  Importantly, the respondent appears not to have taken steps to
             check with the providers of the test certificates to ascertain
             the reliability of either of  them  or  the  process  involved
             with this appellant.


         51.  The interview took place about a year after the appellant  had
             taken her tests.


         52.  The appellant appears to have undertaken a very  long  journey
             to attend the interview test day


         53.    Whatever may be the reason why the appellant  ws  unable  to
             deal with  the interview in a manner the  respondent  expected
             and she gives her explanation for it, which I believe.  I find
             that conclusion that the appellant  practised  fraud  and  had
             obtained  those  certificates  fraudulently   to   be   wholly
             unsustainable in law for the reasons I have given. I find  the
             respondent has not discharged the burden upon her.


         54. The consequence of this is that the appellant  having  provided
             the documents  required  demonstrating  the  English  language
             requirements  were valid. The requirements of the  Rules  have
             been met.


         55.      The appellant and her husband  clearly  have  private  and
             family life in this country. The decision under appeal  if  it
             is implemented, interferes with both to a significant  degree.
             Whilst the decision is in accordance with the law,  meaning  a
             system of law, it is not proportionate because  the  appellant
             meets the  requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  for  the
             reasons given above. Thus  the  appeal  is  allowed  on  human
             rights grounds under the Immigration Rules.


         56.  In any event, even under EX.1. there must be arguable  grounds
             for believing that  the  appellant  would  face  very  serious
             obstacles in returning to China on her own. Her husband  is  a
             British citizen who has  established  himself  here  for  many
             years and would not be admissible to China which, as is common
             knowledge, prohibits dual nationality.  Thus the  couple  will
             be separated and family life  will  come  to  an  end  in  all
             material senses. Thus even on that basis the appeal would   be
             allowed on human rights grounds under  Immigration Rules.


         57.  Accordingly I allow  this  appeal.  The  appellant  should  be
             granted indefinite leave to remain."

12.  The Secretary of State applied for  permission  to  appeal  and  argued
    that the judge had not given proper consideration and  weight  to  what
    was actually recorded on  the  interview  record.   The  appellant  had
    signed the interview record and she had not said that what was  in  the
    interview was incorrect.  The judge had no basis to go behind what  was
    recorded on the interview record.  Given the appellant was  working  in
    the UK the judge had not considered why the  appellant  was  not  in  a
    position to  have  used  and  practiced  her  English  skills  to  show
    improvement.  It was submitted "that the evidence was cogent enough  to
    establish a prima facie case that in light of the appellant's inability
    to understand anything that was asked of her, the results of  her  test
    were  wholly  undermined".   The  determination  was   not   adequately
    reasoned.

13.  A second ground was advanced in relation to what the  judge  had  found
    in paragraph 56 of his determination - it was said that no evidence had
    been cited to support the contention that a British national  would  be
    refused entry to China and there  did  not  appear  to  have  been  any
    submissions on the point.

14.  Mr Avery relied on the grounds that had  been  lodged.   The  appellant
    had been unable to answer virtually any of the matters  that  had  been
    raised at interview.  She had signed the interview.  The judge had gone
    behind what was recorded at the interview.  She had been working in the
    United Kingdom for a number of years and  her  English  was  very  poor
    indeed and she had required an interpreter.  The case of the  Secretary
    of State had been overwhelming.  It was submitted  that  the  appellant
    could not have succeed  in  her  exams  and  the  judge  had  tried  to
    undermine the significance of the interview and his  approach  had  not
    been even-handed.

15.  This  undermined  his  finding  that  the  test  had  not  been   taken
    fraudulently.

16.  In relation to the second point, it was submitted that it would not  be
    unreasonable for the appellant to be returned to China and there was no
    evidence to support the point about dual nationality.

17.  Mr Bazini submitted that there was in effect no case for the  appellant
    to answer.  The grounds did not identify a material error  of  law  and
    were in effect argumentative.  The judge had not rejected the interview
    record as appeared to be claimed in the grounds.  The judge  had  found
    that the record was not clear about what questions were asked and  what
    the responses were.  The weight to be given to a  matter  was  for  the
    judge.  The appellant could not understand what was being said  and  it
    was not proper to require the interview to be signed  if  she  was  not
    represented.

18.  The judge had found the witnesses to be honest and had  believed  their
    evidence.   A declaration appears to have been read to the appellant in
    the course of the interview  which the appellant  would  not  be  in  a
    position to understand.  In answer to  question  2  "Can  you  hear  me
    clearly/are you able to understand me?" the word "no" was recorded  and
    on a separate line "Cannot speak English".  It was not  clear  who  had
    written what.  The second page of the interview record  had a number of
    questions and it was not clear again who had said what.   The  validity
    of the declaration must be in some doubt.

19.  The points made by the judge were perfectly valid.  The  interview  had
    been conducted a year after the test following  a  long  journey.   The
    judge had believed the appellant's evidence.  He had applied the  right
    standard of proof.  While another judge might have  taken  a  different
    view the First-tier Judge had not materially erred in this case.

20.  In relation to ground 2, Counsel said he was not "unsympathetic" to  it
    but it would  only  be  necessary  to  consider  the  argument  if  the
    appellant was unsuccessful on the fraud issue.

21.  Mr Avery submitted that what the judge had said  in  paragraph  49  was
    not relevant. The appellant had sat and passed an English test but  had
    not been able  to  speak  English  at  the  interview.   That  was  the
    fundamental point for the judge to  deal  with.  He  had  attempted  to
    undermine the effect of the interview.

22.  At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision.  I  remind
    myself that I can only interfere with the decision if it was materially
    flawed in law.

23.  The judge correctly addressed himself to the  burden  and  standard  of
    proof. The respondent having made the allegation of fraud was  required
    to make the allegation good.

24.  The interview is a curious document because as I have said  the  second
    question was it is said answered in the negative.  The second  question
    fell into two parts and it is not clear to which part of  the  question
    the word "no" related.  I accept Counsel's points that it is not  clear
    who wrote the comments or answers.  In  any  event,  if  the  appellant
    could  neither hear nor understand there was little  point  in  reading
    her a declaration.  The same point can be  made  about  the  signature.
    That was also preceded by a declaration.  I do  not  find  it  remotely
    arguable that the judge was casting around for reasons to undermine the
    decision.  The judge approached matters with proper care and  scrutiny.
    The respondent was in effect inviting  the  judge  to  infer  from  the
    appellant's performance at interview that  her  test  had  been   taken
    fraudulently.  The judge did not accept this having had the benefit  of
    listening to the appellant's evidence.   He noted that the Secretary of
    State had not backed up her claim  by  making  enquiries  of  the  test
    provider.

25.  While  Counsel  accepted  that  another  First-tier  Judge  might  have
    reached a different decision it was open to this judge to  find  as  he
    did.  He had  had  the  benefit  of  hearing  oral  evidence  from  the
    appellant and her husband and had clearly accepted their  account.   He
    was satisfied that the appellant's poor performance  at  interview  had
    been  satisfactorily explained and he concluded as he says in paragraph
    53 that the allegation that the appellant had practised fraud  and  had
    obtained the certificates fraudulently  was  "wholly  unsustainable  in
    law".

26.  Although I have given careful consideration to the  arguments  advanced
    by Mr Avery I am not satisfied that the determination of the  judge  is
    materially flawed in law as claimed.

27.  In relation to ground  2,  Mr  Bazini  acknowledged  that  he  was  not
    unsympathetic to the arguments advanced by the Secretary of  State  but
    it would not be necessary to go into that if the appellant succeeded on
    the first point.

28.   I  accept  Counsel's  arguments  and  find  that  the  judge  did  not
    materially err in  law.   Accordingly  I  dismiss  the  appeal  of  the
    Secretary of State.   The decision of the First-tier Judge to allow the
    appeal is confirmed

Fee Award

30.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge made a whole fee award of �140  which  is

G Warr, Judge of the Upper Tribunal
