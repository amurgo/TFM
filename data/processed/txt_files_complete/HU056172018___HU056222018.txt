Representation:
For the Second Appellant:  In person
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1) The appellants are citizens of Pakistan. They both appealed against the
    respondent's decisions of 13  February  2018  refusing  them  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom under paragraph  276  of  the  immigration
    rules and on human rights grounds.

 2) The First-tier Tribunal Judge SLL Boyes dismissed the first appellants'
    appeal pursuant to the Immigration Rules and allowed his  appeal  under
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The  judge  then
    dismissed the second appellant's  appeal  both  under  the  immigration
    rules and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights.   Both
    parties have cross-appealed. The second appellant has appealed  against
    the decision of S L L Boyes dismissing her appeal under Article  8  and
    the respondent has appealed against the decision of  S  L  L  Boyes  to
    grant the first appellants' appeal under  Article  8  of  the  European
    Convention  on  Human  Rights.   I  shall  however  for  the  sake   of
    convenience refer to the parties as they were referred  to  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3) The First-tier Tribunal Judge Boyes in a decision stated the  following
    which I have summarised.

 4) The first appellant's application under the  long  residence  rule  was
    dismissed by the First-tier Tribunal Judge on the basis that the  first
    appellant was absent from the United Kingdom for a period exceeding six
    months during the relevant ten year period I  found  that  he  has  not
    resided in the United  Kingdom  lawfully  for  a  continuous  ten  year
    period, so therefore he cannot meet the requirements of  paragraph  276
    of the Immigration Rules.  The judge stated that the  discretion  under
    paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the Immigration Rules is discretionary  and  he
    has no right to interfere with that discretion but he  took  the  first
    appellant's explanation for why he  could  not  return  to  the  United
    Kingdom from Pakistan into account in  his  proportionality  assessment
    under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

 5) The judge noted the evidence that the first appellant relied  on  which
    was medical evidence provided from medical  practitioners  in  Pakistan
    that the first appellant was unwell and could not travel  back  to  the
    United Kingdom. The Judge clearly found the  first  appellants  reasons
    persuasive this but paragraph  57  of  the  decision  that  whilst  the
    Tribunal cannot exercise a discretion as to the existence or  otherwise
    of compelling or compassionate circumstances in determining whether  or
    not the excess absence should  be  disregarded  under  the  Immigration
    Rules, it is entitled to  take  the  application  of  the  respondent's
    policy into account when considering the appellant's Article  8  claim.
    The Judge stated that the  nature  of  the  first  appellant's  medical
    circumstances for why he could  not  return  from  Pakistan  can  quite
    properly inform the evaluation of proportionality pursuant  to  Article
    8.

 6) The respondent's grounds of appeal are that the Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal appropriately found that the first appellant  could  not  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules but has failed to  adequately
    consider the public interest under Section 117B which  requires  little
    weight to be attached to private life established by a person when that
    person's immigration status is precarious.  The Judge  it  was  further
    argued has failed to  identify  sufficiently  compelling  circumstances
    which would outweigh the public interest to give adequate  reasons  for
    finding that it would be  disproportionate  to  expect  the  family  to
    return to Pakistan together as a family.



Findings in respect of the first appellant as to whether there is  an  error
of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 7) The first appellant remained outside the country for a  period  of  244
    days which is in excess  of  the  period  of  time  allowed  under  the
    immigration rules for 10 years continuous lawful residence.  The  judge
    considered  the  appellant's  medical  evidence  from   Pakistan   when
    conducting the balancing exercise in  respect  of  his  proportionality
    assessment pursuant to Article 8. The judge took into account that  the
    first appellant had good reason for why he  could  not  return  to  the
    United Kingdom and this was because  he  became  very  unwell  and  has
    provided cogent medical evidence to demonstrate this.

 8) The respondent states that the judge did  not  take  into  account  the
    public interest as the appellant's immigration status has  always  been
    precarious.  I do not accept that.  The judge has considered the public
    interest and said that inbuilt into the concept  of  little  weight  in
    Section 117B(6) itself  has  a  small  degree  of  flexibility  but  in
    particular in Section 117A(2)(a) which provides  a  limited  degree  of
    flexibility recognised to be necessary in paragraph 36 above.  Although
    this court today defines a precarious immigration for the  purposes  of
    117B(5) with a risk from which most applicants rely  on  their  private
    life under Article 8 who would be unable to escape, Section  117A(2)(a)
    necessarily enables the applications to occasionally succeed.   It  was
    open to the judge to find that this was one case where the  appellant's
    application  should  succeed  even  though  he  does   not   meet   the
    requirements of the immigration rules.

 9) The respondent had also argued that the appellant  does  not  meet  the
    financial  requirement  threshold  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The judge found that in paragraph 276B  application
    there is no level of income which must be achieved on  the  grounds  of
    ten years' continuous lawful residence.  The judge  took  into  account
    that the appellant has lived in this country for ten years and  it  was
    only his absence of 244 days from the United  Kingdom  which  precluded
    the appellant from meeting the requirements of  the  immigration  rules
    and clearly accepted the reasons advanced by the appellant for  why  he
    was away for those days.

10) As the grounds of appeal are limited to human rights clearly there  can
    be no question of my entertaining an appeal on  grounds  alleging  that
    the decision was not in accordance with  the  law  or  the  immigration
    rules as these are not permissible grounds on  the  grounds  of  appeal
    only relate to Article 8 of the European Convention  on  Human  Rights.
    However if the appellant can show that this would  interfere  with  his
    private life or family life then it will be  necessary  to  assess  the
    evidence to see if the appellant meets the substance of the rules.

11) Therefore in respect of the first appellant I find that the  judge  was
    entitled consider the reasons why the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
    requirements of the immigration rules and as he had  no  discretion  to
    excuse the days in excess that  the  appellant  has  been  out  of  the
    country because  that discretion belongs to the respondent. However  he
    was entitled to give the appellant's explanation for why he was out  of
    the country for more than the period  required  under  the  immigration
    rules, appropriate weight in his proportionality balance under  Article
    8 even though it may not be determinative. The ability to  satisfy  the
    rules illuminates the proportionality of the  decision  to  refuse  him
    entry clearance.  The judge considered all the evidence and found  that
    the first appellant's case came within the exceptionality rule where he
    should be allowed to remain under Article 8 even though  he  could  not
    meet the requirements of the immigration rules.

12) I find there is no material error of law in the decision of the  first-
    tier Tribunal Judge in respect of the first appellant and I dismiss the
    respondent's appeal of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and  the
    decision stands allowing the first appellant's appeal.

13) In respect of the second appellant, the second appellant is the wife of
    the first appellant.   The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  dismissed  her
    appeal under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human  Rights  and
    said that she can return to Pakistan with her children  and  the  first
    appellant can choose whether to return with his wife and children or to
    live in the United Kingdom.

14) I find the decision made by Judge Boyes to be an  unusual  one.   While
    giving the first appellant leave to remain under  Article  8  and  then
    requiring the appellant's wife and daughters to leave the  country  and
    go back to Pakistan on their own, the judge has granted  permission  to
    the first appellant to remain in this country but at the same time made
    it impossible for him to do so. The first appellant has this unenviable
    choice whether to remain in this country without his family  or  return
    to Pakistan with his family and  forego  his  right  to  live  in  this
    country with all the advantages that entails and who has lived here for
    10 years. I therefore find that  there  is  a  material  error  in  the
    decision of the judge because his decision would  lead  to  fragmenting
    this family.

15) I now remake the decision for the second appellant.  I have  considered
    the short submissions made by the second appellant and  Mr  Tufan.   Mr
    Tufan argues that the appellant is not settled in  the  United  Kingdom
    and has only been granted leave to remain under Article 8 and therefore
    the public interest  requires  that  the  second  appellant  leave  the
    country with her daughters.  I have considered the Article 8 rights  of
    the appellant and her two children.  Although they are  not  qualifying
    children, but nevertheless I must undertake the best interests  of  the
    children in any decision that I make in relation to them.  I take  into
    account that the second appellant's husband has been granted  leave  to
    remain under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and I
    have to evaluate where does family life for the  second  appellant  and
    her children lie.

16) The second appellant's husband has lived in this country for ten  years
    and the second appellant has lived in this  country  for  seven  years.
    The appellants' children's best interests  lies  by  living  with  both
    parents in the family unit. The eldest child is 6� years  old  but  has
    not reached the age of 7 and therefore not a qualifying child but  that
    is only six months away. I find that her best interest lies  in  living
    with both parents  wherever they live.

17) In my evaluation I must  consider  the  respondent's  interests  in  an
    orderly and fair immigration  control.  I  have  a  statutory  duty  to
    consider the matters set out in s 117B of the 2002  Act  which  I  have
    done. The respondent's interest must guide and inform my decision.

18) I noted in respect of the first appellant his appeal was refused  under
    the Immigration Rules on the basis that he had  been  absent  from  the
    country and the respondent refused to exercise his  discretion  in  the
    first  appellant's  favour  despite  cogent  medical  evidence  of  his
    inability to travel back to the United Kingdom. I  find  that  in  this
    case the respondent's interests  will  not  be  compromised  given  the
    immigration history of the first appellant where he has lawfully  lived
    in this country for 10 years minus the time that  he  was  out  of  the
    country in Pakistan for medical reasons.  The  second  appellant  would
    have been granted leave to remain in  line  with  the  first  appellant
    under the immigration rules had  the  first  appellant  not  become  so
    unwell and could not return to the United Kingdom.

19) I find that there are exceptional circumstances in  this  appeal  where
    the second appellant's appeal should  succeed.  The  first  appellants'
    children and the second appellant should not be required to  leave  the
    United Kingdom for as long as the first appellant lives in this country
    to preserve the family life of this family.

20) I therefore remake the second appellant's appeal  and  allow  it  under
    Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

21) The upshot is that both appellants appeals are allowed under Article  8
    of the European Convention on Human Rights.
