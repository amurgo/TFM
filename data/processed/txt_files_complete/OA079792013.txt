                                                                  Respondent


         Decision on Appellant's application to withdraw her appeal

1.    By an Order dated 13 October 2015, the Court of  Appeal  remitted  the
    appeal of the appellant to the Upper Tribunal for redetermination.

2.    By a letter dated 12 February 2016, the  appellant's  representatives,
    TRP Solicitors Ltd, informed the Upper Tribunal  that  the  appeal  had
    become academic because the appellant had been granted entry  clearance
    in response to a fresh application for entry clearance. They  therefore
    sought leave to withdraw the appeal on the appellant's behalf.

3.    Rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  (the
    "UT Rules") provides for a party to withdraw its case before the  Upper
    Tribunal, with the consent of the Tribunal.

4.    The Upper Tribunal hereby consents to the withdrawal by the  Appellant
    of her case. Accordingly, the  decision  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal A J Parker stands unopposed. The appeal of  the  Appellant  to
    the Upper Tribunal is therefore dismissed.

5.    The hearing on 26 February 2016 will therefore be vacated.
