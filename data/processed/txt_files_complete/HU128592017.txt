                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    This is an appeal, by the , against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Malcolm Parkes), sitting at  Birmingham  on  10  August
    2018, to  a human rights appeal against deportation  by  a  citizen  of
    Jamaica, born 1980. The  earlier  history  of  the  appeal  proceedings
    appears in Kiarie and Byndloss [2017] UKSC 42.

 2. That decision was based on a Home Office decision of  4  October  2014,
    following the  deportation  order  signed  on  the  2nd,  refusing  the
    appellant's article 8 human rights claim, and certifying  it  under  s.
    94B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  so  that  he
    could only appeal  from  outside  this  country,  and  a  supplementary
    decision letter to the same effect on 4 September 2015.  Following  the
    decision of the Supreme Court, a further decision letter was issued  on
    4 October 2017, revoking the previous ones, but once again refusing the
    appellant's human rights claim, but this time with an in-country  right
    of appeal.

 3. The hearing judge began his  decision  with  a  brief  recital  of  the
    decisions before him, referring both to the 2015 and  2017  letters  as
    'supplementary' (to the original one from  2014).  Mr  Chelvan's  first
    point (ground 1) was that this was wrong in principle, since  the  2017
    letter had revoked the earlier  ones.  I  asked  him  to  specify  what
    relevant information it gave which was neglected by the judge:  he  was
    unable to do so, but took his stand on principle.  Mr  Lindsay  pointed
    out that the significant change in the Home Office's position had  been
    the withdrawal of  the  certificate,  following  the  decision  of  the
    Supreme Court.

 4. There is nothing whatever before me to show that the judge was  unaware
    of that, or of anything relevant in the current state of affairs on the
    facts of the case, or the present legal position, and  this  ground  is
    rejected. Ground 2 suggests that this appellant should be regarded as a
    person who has been lawfully resident in the UK for most of  his  life.
    Once again, he was born in 1980, and did not come here till  2002;  the
    first-tier hearing was in 2018.

 5. On the authorities (see for example SC  (Jamaica) [2017] EWCA Civ 2112,
    at paragraphs 53 and 69), it is now quite clear that 'most of his life'
    does involve a simple calculation, on which this  appellant  could  not
    succeed. It follows that ground 2 also fails.

 6. Ground 3 challenges the judge's approach to the  fact-finding  exercise
    involved in deciding on the best interests of  any  children  involved.
    Since in this case the judge found very clearly (see his paragraph  51)
    that it would be in these children's best interests for  the  appellant
    "... to remain  in  the  UK  to  give  support  to  their  mothers  and
    facilitate their meeting as an extended family member", this cannot  be
    of any real significance, and this ground fails too.

 7. As the judge went on to point out, this does not answer the question as
    to whether it would be unduly harsh for  the  appellant's  children  to
    remain in the UK without him, though of course it will be  relevant  to
    it. That is the point on which this appeal must turn, and the remaining
    grounds are about the judge's approach to it.

 8. The first thing that has to be said about that, on grounds 4 and 5,  is
    that, while at one time it seemed to be settled (see for example in  MM
    (Uganda) [2016] EWCA  Civ  617))  that  the  criminal  and  immigration
    history of the (main)  must be taken into  account,  it  has  now  been
    conclusively established, in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53, that this  is
    not to be done. That decision  of  course  came  after  the  first-tier
    hearing in this case, and the judge could not  have  been  expected  to
    anticipate it; but the approach taken in it. still has to be followed.

 9. In this case, the judge did take significant account of the appellant's
    criminal history, not the minor offences between 2010 and 2012, but his
    conviction for possession of class 'A' drugs with intent to  supply  in
    2013, for which he was sentenced  to  three  years'  imprisonment.  The
    sentencing judge had regarded his rï¿½le as significant, though mitigated
    to an extent by his lack of knowledge of what  specific  drugs  he  was
    storing in his house. Judge Parkes  understandably  regarded  the  fact
    that he was storing class 'A' drugs there at all,  while  his  children
    slept upstairs, as an aggravating feature of the case  against  him  on
    deportation.

10. While the judge is criticized in the grounds for giving  the  appellant
    less than full credit for staying out of trouble  since  then,  on  the
    basis that he has been involved in the present litigation, that  point,
    even if it were established, must fall away with the rule in KO. If the
    appellant's misconduct can no longer  be  taken  into  account  on  the
    question of whether his removal would be unduly harsh for his children,
    neither can his later reform, whether complete or partial.

11. On ground 6, the only relevance of the appellant's past conduct  is  as
    to any current effect  on  his  children's  welfare.  Since  the  judge
    accepted that he had been out of trouble since 2013, whether  with  the
    incentive of these proceedings or not, this does not seem to arise, and
    ground 6 could not invalidate the  judge's  decision,  subject  to  the
    point at grounds 4 and 5.

12. Mr Chelvan did not address me in any detail at all on grounds 7,  8,  9
    or 10. Ground  7  mainly  criticizes  the  judge  for  taking  what  is
    described  as  a  'moralistic'  and  'ethnocentric'  approach  to   the
    appellant's private life, where he has  begotten  children  with  three
    different women. Leaving aside entirely the question of what  a  number
    of people in the appellant's own community might think  of  that,  this
    point is wholly immaterial, given that the judge nevertheless found  it
    was in the children's best interests for him to be allowed to stay.

13.  The only relevance of anything in these grounds is where  the  judge's
    findings might have affected his approach to the present  interests  of
    the children. Here the criticism turns on what he said at paragraphs 43
    - 45:

         "43. Ordinarily it is in a child's best interests to live with both
         parents in a  stable  and  caring  environment.  The  Appellant  is
         directly responsible for that not being possible for  his  children
         in this case. There are a number of ways in which the Appellant has
         not put the children's best interests as a primary consideration in
         his behaviour. The Appellant's criminal offending was not prevented
         by his parental responsibilities which increased  in  serious[ness]
         as time went by ...

         44.  [is about the point discussed at 9].

         45.  The situation I have to assess is entirely of the  Appellant's
         own making. In a number of different ways,  pursuing  a  number  of
         relationships (some simultaneously) and his criminal offending  the
         Appellant has put his own interests first, relegating the needs  of
         his partners and children. His  obligations  to  his  partners  and
         children did not appear to cause him to reflect on how his  actions
         might affect others and his description of how  his  wife's  health
         affected him led him to commit the most  serious  of  his  offences
         rather than to focus on where his responsibilities lay."

14. Despite the criticism of those paragraphs at 7A - H, it is quite  clear
    that they all relate to the history  of  how  the  appellant's  present
    family situation came about. On the other hand, at 46 the judge accepts
    that  he  maintains  a  relationship  with  all   his   children,   and
    unreservedly accepts that this is not  a  cynical  ploy  on  his  part.
    Equally at 48 he accepts that all the  appellant's  children  see  each
    other regularly, and enjoy it.

15. The  suggestion  at  ground  8  that  the  children  should  have  been
    separately represented is not one which was made at any previous  stage
    of the proceedings, including by  the  independent  social  worker  who
    reported on the appellant's side, and I cannot accept that it shows any
    material error of law on the part of the judge. It is also quite  clear
    that, when he accepted at 47 that the appellant  "...  facilitates  all
    the children having contact with each other at weekends  ...",  he  was
    referring back to the appellant's own evidence at 22 that they all came
    to stay with him, and his contention that they would not spend the time
    together if he were not there.

16. The judge's only qualification on that is  to  say  that  the  loss  of
    contact would not be inevitable if the mothers involved sought  to  co-
    operate for their children's sake. Clearly he recognizes that  this  is
    not particularly likely, in view of the findings he goes on to make  at
    48; but it needed to be said  that  the  mothers  did  have  their  own
    responsibility for the children's happiness. That is enough to  dispose
    of ground 8.

17. Ground 9 criticizes the judge's conclusions at 49 - 51;  but  the  real
    complaint is about his finding at 49 that the families had coped  while
    the appellant was in prison. No detailed reference was made, either  in
    the grounds or in Mr Chelvan's submissions before me, which did no more
    than touch on this point, to the grounds  for  the  independent  social
    worker's conclusions, on which it  is  based.  Whether  the  expression
    'coped' or 'survived' is used, the judge had the facts of what happened
    while the appellant was in prison well in mind. He  nevertheless  found
    at 48 that the appellant's removal would cause the  children  distress,
    and they might return to bad behaviour which had happened while he  was
    in prison. Equally at 50 he accepted that the  appellant's  removal  to
    Jamaica would effectively sever any contact he had with  the  children,
    which of course his imprisonment here had not done. All  this  resulted
    in a positive finding at 51 that it would be  in  the  children's  best
    interests for him to be allowed to stay here.

18. In the end, all that was required was for the judge to give full weight
    to this  finding,  as  he  undoubtedly  did;  but  without  taking  the
    appellant's past conduct against  him,  as  now  required  by  KO.  The
    experienced judge knows best whether that past conduct was  a  decisive
    factor for him, or merely a significant  one,  and  will  be  perfectly
    capable of re-deciding the case without taking account of it.  As  made
    clear in RA (s.117C: "unduly harsh"; offence: seriousness) Iraq  [2019]
    UKUT 123 (IAC), the approach  is  as  set  out  by  Jackson  LJ  in  NA
    (Pakistan) & another [2016] EWCA Civ 662.

19. A further hearing will give both parties an opportunity to present  any
    views they may have on the point.  Since  this  exercise  will  involve
    subtraction, rather than addition of a factor, I see no reason why  any
    further evidence should be required. The  appeal  should  be  re-listed
    before Judge Parkes: while I have directed, as usual, that this hearing
    should be at Birmingham, the same advocates as before me  may  wish  to
    appear at it, and they can apply to him for it to be heard in London.
