                                    Ebet
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               The Secretary Of State For The Home Department
                                                                  Respondent


                     REASONS FOR FINDING AN ERROR OF LAW

      1. On 18 December 2017 I granted permission in these terms:

          1. Given that the Court of Appeal has said in Khan v Secretary of
             State for the Home Department & Anor [2017] EWCA Civ 1755  (09
             November 2017) that Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal)  [2016]  UKUT
             0411 (1AC) was wrongly decided and the First-tier Tribunal had
             jurisdiction to hear this appeal,  I  grant  permission.   The
             First-tier Tribunal Judge did not go on to decide  the  merits
             of the appeal.

          2. The respondent must serve and file a response to my  grant  of
             permission within 21 days of this order  stating  (i)  whether
             the  respondent  agrees  the   First-tier   Tribunal   Judge's
             determination was in error (irrespective of the fact  that  it
             was inadvertent) and  that  permission  to  appeal  should  be
             granted; (ii) that the determination should be set  aside  and
             (iii) the decision be re-made in the First-tier Tribunal.   If
             the respondent considers this can be dealt  with  by  consent,
             there will be no need for a hearing in the Upper Tribunal  and
             an order will be made to that effect.

      2. There has been no response to my proposal.  The respondent has  not
         indicated a disagreement with the course I proposed.

DECISION

      i) The First-tier Tribunal Judge made an error on a point of law and I
         set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

     ii) I direct that the appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for
         re-making.


                                                      Date: 13 February 2018
                                                               ANDREW JORDAN
                                                 JUDGE OF THE UPPER TRIBUNAL
