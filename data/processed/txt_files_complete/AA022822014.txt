                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

    1. On 20 April 2015 the Court  of  Appeal  allowed  the  appeal  of  the
       appellant against the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  dated  23  May
       2014 and in the accompanying  Statement  of  Reasons  the  Respondent
       accepted that both the First tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal had
       erred in law in failing to properly consider the  Joint  Presidential
       Guidance Note No 2 of 2010. In such circumstances  it  is  inevitable
       that I record that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law and that this
       decision is set aside.

    2. Given that the failure of the First tier  Tribunal  to  consider  the
       Joint Presidential Guidance Note No 2 0f 2010  arose  in  respect  of
       persons claiming to have been a victim of rape, I  apply  the  Senior
       President Practice Statement  7.2(a)  and  (b)  which  identifies  as
       circumstances making it appropriate to remit an appeal to the  First-
       tier Tribunal where (a) the effect of the error of law has been  that
       a party has been deprived of a fair hearing or other opportunity  for
       that party's case to be put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
       Tribunal; or (b), the nature or extent of any  judicial  fact-finding
       which is necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be  re-
       made is such that, having regard to the overriding objective in  rule
       2, it is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal".

    3.  Accordingly,  pursuant  to  s.12  of  the  Tribunals,   Courts   and
       Enforcement  Act  2007,  read  together  with  the   above   Practice
       Statement, I remit the case  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  the
       direction that it not be dealt with by Judges Grimmett or Black.
