                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant born on 28th August 1989 is a citizen of  Pakistan.   The
    Appellant who was present was represented by Mr Holt of  Counsel.   The
    Respondent was represented by Mr  McVeety,  a  Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer.



Substantive Issues under Appeal

 2. The Appellant had entered the United Kingdom on 24th August 2010  as  a
    student and continued in that capacity until 15th May 2013.  His  leave
    to remain was curtailed on 22nd February 2013  with  effect  from  22nd
    April 2013 as the college licence was revoked.  On 14th March 2013  the
    Appellant then applied for leave to remain outside of  the  Immigration
    Rules as a fianc�.  The application was refused by the Home  Office  on
    16th May 2013.

 3. The Appellant appealed that decision and his appeal was heard by First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Hague sitting at Manchester on 19th February  2014.
    The judge dismissed the Appellant's appeal under both  the  Immigration
    Rules and under the Human Rights Act.

 4. Lengthy Grounds of Appeal for application for permission to appeal  was
    submitted.  Permission to appeal was granted by Designated Judge  Lewis
    on 26th March 2014.  The  Respondent  opposed  such  application  by  a
    letter dated 2nd April 2014.  Directions were  issued  and  the  matter
    comes before me in accordance with those directions.

Submissions on behalf of the Appellant

 5. Mr Holt of Counsel referred  me  to  the  grounds  for  application  to
    appeal.  In summary  of  his  submissions  and  those  grounds  it  was
    submitted that  the  judge  had  looked  wrongly  or  speculatively  at
    features of the evidence and presentation of the case that had led  him
    to conclude that there would be  no  insurmountable  obstacles  in  the
    Appellant's wife relocating with him to  Pakistan  and  therefore  that
    finding was significantly flawed by the manner in which the  judge  had
    reached that conclusion.

Submissions on behalf of the Respondent

 6. The Respondent strongly supported the findings reached by the judge  in
    his determination and pointed to the evidence  within  the  Appellant's
    bundle that had led in part the judge to have reached  conclusions  and
    to have made statements within the determination that he had.   It  was
    said there was no error of law in this case.

 7. At the conclusion I reserved my decision to consider the documents  and
    evidence submitted.  I now provide that decision with my reasons.

Decision and Reasons

 8. The Appellant's history in the UK is summarised above.  It would appear
    that following the refusal of  his  application  for  leave  to  remain
    outside of the Rules as a fianc�, such refusal being taken on 16th  May
    2013, he then on 14th June 2013 entered into an arranged marriage  with
    a British citizen.

 9. Although the marriage had taken place after the  Home  Office  refusal,
    the refusal letter noted the Appellant's claim to have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting relationship  with  his  fianc�e  and  to  have  a  marriage
    arranged.  The Home Office therefore had looked at the Appellant's case
    under both Appendix FM and paragraph 276ADE of the  Immigration  Rules.
    Contained within that examination was a consideration of  whether  EX.1
    applied to the Appellant which itself has an element of discretion  and
    further the Home Office had looked outside of the Immigration Rules  to
    see if there were any  compelling  or  compassionate  circumstances  to
    warrant an examination of the case outside of the Rules.

10. The judge had  provided  a  summary  of  the  evidence  that  had  been
    presented  before  him.   The  judge  had  correctly  noted  that   the
    Appellant's application could  not  succeed  under  the  Rules  firstly
    because entry clearance was not  granted  in  that  capacity  but  also
    because on the evidence presented had the Appellant made application in
    the proper manner he would have failed  to  meet  the  requirements  of
    maintenance.  There may  have  been  other  features  that  would  have
    founded such application if made from Pakistan but the judge  correctly
    identified those features.  It is also not argued  that  the  Appellant
    failed to meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE.

11. The judge correctly had therefore gone on to consider the matter  under
    EX.1(b) to see whether  there  were  any  insurmountable  obstacles  to
    family life with his partner continuing outside the UK.

12. The judge had considered the position of the Appellant's  wife  and  in
    summary had noted that at paragraphs 6 to 12 of the determination.   In
    summary and as the evidence discloses the Appellant's wife was a  young
    woman of 19 years of age.  Although  born  in  the  UK  and  a  British
    citizen she was of Pakistani  background  and  indeed  the  Appellant's
    bundle contains the photocopies of the British passport of  her  family
    members demonstrating they were all born in Pakistan.  It  is  unknown,
    because the evidence does not disclose one way or  the  other,  whether
    her family members also maintain Pakistani nationality  and  passports.
    The marriage between herself and the Appellant was an arranged marriage
    between the two families and at a time when it was known to her and all
    the family members that he had no settled status in the UK  and  indeed
    had only been in the UK for a short period on a temporary visa with  no
    expectation or basis for presumption he would not be  removed  back  to
    Pakistan.

13. The judge had concluded at paragraph  8  that  the  marriage  had  been
    arranged with the principal objective of creating a situation in  which
    the Appellant could remain in the United Kingdom.  That is a conclusion
    that was open to the judge to reach on the evidence before him  and  in
    particular given he had the opportunity  of  seeing  and  hearing  from
    witnesses in this case.  The background history referred  to  above  is
    certainly not inconsistent with the conclusion reached  by  the  judge.
    In terms of any  difficulties  or  problems  that  she  would  face  in
    Pakistan the judge had noted her evidence at paragraph 10 in  that  the
    only example that she had provided had been her inability  to  work  if
    she went to  Pakistan.   The  judge  had  found  that  to  be  somewhat
    disingenuous as she had been unemployed since leaving  school  and  had
    only began employment three months prior  to  the  application  and  in
    circumstances where he viewed that as  being  related  to  the  appeal.
    Again he was entitled to reach that conclusion.  It is also  noteworthy
    that  her  witness  statement  essentially  although  not   exclusively
    referred to her inability to  work  as  being  in  her  view  the  main
    obstacle to her relocating to Pakistan.

14. If it could be said that the wife's young age and possible lack of life
    experience may  not  necessarily  have  made  her  aware  of  potential
    obstacles in going to Pakistan the same assumption could  not  be  made
    for her family members all of whom, as the judge found,  had  supported
    and indeed put together this arranged marriage.

15. The judge having found as he was entitled to that the Appellant  failed
    under the Immigration Rules his examination of  the  matter  thereafter
    under  EX.1(b)  he  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  there  were  not
    insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  resettlement  of  the   Appellant's
    partner.  He had correctly  referred  himself  to  Gulshan  as  to  the
    meaning of insurmountable  obstacles,  namely  the  resettlement  of  a
    partner to be construed as relating to the practical  possibilities  of
    relocating.  He had also at paragraph 12 noted and taken account of the
    fact that the Appellant's wife was a British  citizen  and  should  not
    likely be expected to forego the advantages of living in the country of
    her birth.  The conclusions reached by the  judge  in  the  remains  of
    paragraph 12 and indeed in other paragraphs  within  his  determination
    are conclusions he was entitled to reach on  the  evidence  before  him
    both in documentary form and that which was presented at the hearing.

16. Although not referred to by the judge because of the date  of  hearing;
    in support of the position adopted by the judge the case of Haleemudeen
    [2014] EWCA Civ 558 is a relevant case in which amongst  other  matters
    the court at paragraph 64 noted that the provisions of paragraph 276ADE
    and Appendix FM undoubtedly constitute a formidable hurdle to overcome.
     A further case of some relevance to this matter is that of Rafiq heard
    on 7th May 2014 in the High Court.  That case  concerned  an  Appellant
    seeking to remain in the UK as the spouse of  a  British  citizen.   In
    that case it was noted that the correct question was whether there were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing if the claimant  was
    removed and that was the test under  both  European  jurisprudence  and
    paragraph EX.1(b).  It should be further noted that in that case (which
    also concerned a person from Pakistan) the High Court  noted  that  the
    status of the claimant at the time the  relationship  started  and  his
    wife's awareness of that  status  are  relevant  features.   Where  his
    status was precarious, it would only be exceptional that removal  would
    be a violation of Article 8.  It should be further noted that that case
    said:

         "I  need  not  repeat  the  analysis  of  the  phrase   exceptional
         circumstances in MF (Nigeria).  It refers to  other  factors  which
         are not expressly set out in the new Rules.  In the present case it
         would include the fact that the  claimant's  wife  is  not  only  a
         British citizen but also culturally and entirely British.  It would
         encompass the respect for her right to reside anywhere  in  the  EU
         and in particular in the UK.  Such factors  however  are  not  that
         uncommon.  They do not here  persuade  me  that  the  decision  was
         legally flawed.  In effect this challenge though brought by way  of
         judicial review ends up as an appeal to the merits of the case  and
         the sympathy of the Tribunal.  I can well see that the prospect  of
         moving to Pakistan or losing her husband is acutely  stressful  for
         the claimant's wife.   However  having  regard  to  the  claimant's
         status at the time the relationship started  and  at  the  time  of
         marriage that is a choice which was foreseeable."

17. The judge in this case was entitled to look at the factors he  referred
    to in terms of forming a judgment on the ability or  otherwise  of  the
    Appellant's wife to relocate to Pakistan.  He had also identified  that
    the marriage was  essentially  engineered  or  brought  about  for  the
    purposes of this application a conclusion he was entitled to reach.  He
    was also aware of the accepted fact that at the time of  such  marriage
    she and the respective families who  had  arranged  the  marriage  were
    fully aware of the Appellant's  precarious  immigration  status.   When
    looking at the recent case law following the new Immigration Rules  and
    including the two cases referred to above which were promulgated  after
    the judge's determination the approach taken by the judge in this  case
    was correct and the conclusions he reached were conclusions open to him
    on the evidence and compatible with recent case law in this field.

Decision

18. There was no error of law made by the judge in this case and  I  uphold
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.
