                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer against  the  decision
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands, promulgated on 20 February 2017,
    in which he allowed Mrs. Asman's appeal  against  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer's decision to refuse entry  clearance  as  the  spouse  of  the
    Sponsor.


 2. For the purposes of this  decision  I  refer  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer  as  the  Respondent  and  to  Mrs.  Asman  as  the  Appellant,
    reflecting their positions as they were before the First-tier Tribunal.


 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:


         "It is arguable, as submitted within the grounds  of  appeal,  that
         the Judge has materially erred in  taking  into  account  documents
         that were not submitted  with  the  application,  when  considering
         whether or not the requirements of Appendix FM-SE had been met,  in
         respect of the specified documents necessary to prove the financial
         requirements of the  Rules.   The  Judge  has  not  stated  if  the
         documents he took account of were submitted with  the  application,
         as opposed to after the application, as contended by the  Secretary
         of State."


 4. The Sponsor attended  the  hearing.   I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives following which I reserved my decision.


Error of Law


 5. The Appellant's appeal had previously been to the Upper Tribunal.   The
    original decision of the First-tier Tribunal was set aside by way of  a
    decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Shaerf dated 8 July  2016.   In
    paragraph [17] he stated:


         "Consequently his decision in that respect must be  set  aside  but
         his  findings  as  to  the  genuineness  and  subsistence  of   the
         Applicant's marriage are retained and shall stand.  This is  not  a
         points-based system appeal and so the principles  in  DR  (Morocco)
         (ECO: post-decision evidence) [2005] UKIAT 00038 will apply and the
         Applicant and her husband will have  ample  opportunity  to  ensure
         that the relevant documentation to show  the  Applicant  meets  the
         requirements of  Appendix  FM  is  supported  by  evidence  in  the
         specified form as provided by Appendix FM-SE."


 6. I find that the  Appellant's  appeal  was  remitted  for  consideration
    specifically as to whether or  not  the  Appellant  met  the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  As clearly set  out  by  Deputy  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Shaerf, the  principles  in  DR  (Morocco)  applied  and
    therefore the Appellant could provide evidence to show that she met the
    requirements of the immigration rules which had not been provided  with
    the application, so long as it pertained to  circumstances  as  at  the
    date of the decision.


 7. The grounds of appeal before me  submit  that  the  Judge  should  have
    dismissed the appeal on the basis that the Appellant could not meet the
    requirements of Appendix  FM-SE  as  she  had  failed  to  provide  the
    necessary specified  documents  with  the  application.   There  is  no
    reference in the grounds to the decision of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
    Shaerf.  This decision was not  appealed  against  by  the  Respondent.
    However, it was clear, as  set  out  by  Deputy  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Shaerf, that the evidence which could be provided was not restricted to
    evidence provided with the application.  The Appellant was entitled  to
    provide evidence to show that she met the requirements of Appendix  FM-
    SE even if such evidence  had  not  been  before  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer or the Entry Clearance Manager when the decision was made.


 8. It was submitted  by  Ms  Pinder  that  there  was  no  basis  for  the
    Respondent's position.  "Specified evidence" had to be  provided  under
    the immigration rules for the decision maker, be that the Secretary  of
    State or the Entry Clearance Officer,  but  this  requirement  was  not
    binding on the Tribunals.  The case of DR (Morocco) provided that post-
    decision evidence could be  considered  so  long  as  it  pertained  to
    circumstances as at the date of the decision.


 9. There is no restriction in statute which  prevents  the  Tribunal  from
    considering evidence which was not before the decision maker  in  these
    circumstances.  The only restriction is that the evidence  pertains  to
    the date of the decision.


10. It has not been submitted by the Respondent that the Appellant did  not
    provide the evidence, only  that  she  did  not  provide  it  with  the
    application.  While it  is  open  for  the  Respondent  to  refuse  the
    application because the evidence has not been submitted, that is not  a
    ground for the First-tier Tribunal to dismiss the appeal.


11. Consequently I find that there is no arguable error of  law  identified
    by the grounds of appeal.  No regard has  been  paid  to  the  previous
    decision of the Upper Tribunal when compiling those grounds.  There  is
    no  reference  to  paragraph  [17]  of  that  decision  and  the  clear
    instruction from Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Shaerf that  post-decision
    evidence could be provided.


12. I accept that the decision is not detailed.  However, the judge  states
    at [7]:


         "Before the hearing I had been provided with a bundle of  documents
         which dealt with the finances of her spouse in the relevant  months
         leading up to the application in 2014.  There was no need  to  hear
         oral evidence and submissions at the hearing and I simply  reserved
         my decision, which I now give."


13. It was submitted by Ms Pinder that  the  Record  of  Proceedings  could
    assist in showing whether or not  a  concession  had  been  made.   She
    submitted that it was clear that a concession must have been made given
    that there were no submissions made by the Respondent.  The  Record  of
    Proceedings is short and simply notes that no evidence  or  submissions
    were made and that there was a reliance merely on the documentation.


 14.      I find that the judge  considered  the  evidence  which  had  been
     provided.  It has not been argued that  it  was  not  provided  to  the
     Respondent.  In paragraph [8] the judge finds that  this  documentation
     shows that the Sponsor had two employments and that his income averaged
     in excess  of  ï¿½21,000.   Presumably  it  is  on  this  basis  that  no
     submissions were made  by  the  Respondent's  representative,  who  had
     received the bundle of documents in advance of the hearing.


15. I find that the grounds of appeal identify no arguable  error  of  law,
    particularly given that the basis on which the decision was to be  made
    by the First-tier Tribunal was clearly set out in the previous decision
    of the Upper Tribunal.  The decision does not involve the making of  an
    error of law.


    Notice of Decision


16. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not involve the making  of
    a material error of law and I do not set it aside.  The decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal stands.


17. No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                                  Date 20 December 2017
