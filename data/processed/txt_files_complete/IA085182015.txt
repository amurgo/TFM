                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

    Introduction



    1. The claimant is a citizen of the Ivory Coast born  on  5th  December
       1988. He arrived in the UK with his mother to  join  his  father  in
       October 2001 when he was 12 years old. Starting in 2003  he  made  a
       number of applications for indefinite leave to remain which were all
       refused, and had an appeal to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  was
       dismissed on 3rd January 2007. He made a human rights application on
       16th May 2012 which was refused on 12th February  2015.  His  appeal
       against the decision to refuse  his  human  rights  application  was
       allowed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Greasley  after  a  hearing  on
       23rd July 2015.

    2. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal by Judge  of
       the First-tier Tribunal Pooler on  25th  November  2015  as  it  was
       arguable the First-tier Tribunal had erred in law. The  matter  came
       before me and I decided that the First-tier Tribunal  had  erred  in
       law for the reasons set out in my  decision  which  is  appended  as
       Annex A to this decision.

Evidence - Re-making

    3. The claimant's evidence is, in summary, as follows.

    4. He is a citizen of Ivory Coast born on 5th December 1988. He came to
       the UK in October 2001 when he was 12 years old with his mother, Mrs
       Guelapehin Helene Kousso Ouya, to join  his  father,  Reverend  Doua
       Petemahin Jean Kousso, who was already resident here. His father  is
       a minister of religion in the  UK.   His  two  sisters  (Doua  Kepin
       ReineVictoire Kousso born on 29th August  1986  and  Massea  Perside
       Grace Kousso Doua born on 1st May 1984)  arrived  a  year  later  in
       2002. The claimant made applications to be treated as  his  father's
       dependent but these were refused.

    5. The claimant says he has not  left  the  UK  since  his  arrival  in
       October 2001. His mother returned to Ivory  Coast  and  applied  for
       entry clearance in 2008 and stated  on  her  application  for  entry
       clearance that her children were in France. His father  also  stated
       at an appeal that he was in France in  2009.  These  statements,  he
       says, were not correct. He definitely was not in France between July
       2008 and May 2010. There are no documents for him demonstrating  his
       presence in the UK during  this  time  as  he  had  been  unable  to
       progress his studies or  a  football  career  due  to  his  lack  of
       immigration status. He simply lived with his father in the  UK.  His
       siblings were also in the UK living with their spouses. He  believed
       that his church had written that he had  been  attending  with  them
       during this time however.

    6. The claimant had not applied for leave until 2011, despite  becoming
       an adult in 2006, because things had been  very  difficult  for  him
       after he had discovered he could not go to university in  2008,  and
       when his mother had been forced to return to the  Ivory  Coast,  and
       the family had financial problems. He  had  simply  lived  with  his
       parents at their address during this time, and  gradually  taken  on
       the voluntary work he has since dedicated his time too.

    7. Today the claimant's father, mother and his sister Grace are British
       citizens. His sister Victoire  is  an  Ivorian  citizen  who  has  a
       residence permit as an EEA  spouse  of  a  French  national  who  is
       exercising Treaty rights in the UK. His siblings have  both  married
       so the claimant also has in-laws and three nieces and nephews in the
       UK.

    8. The claimant has lived with his parents and sisters  for  his  whole
       period of residence in the UK at their various  addresses  in  south
       London and Croydon. He recently lived with his sister Victoire,  who
       is married to a French  national  and  who  has  a  French  national
       daughter, for a period of time but has now returned to live with his
       parents.

    9. The claimant says he should be allowed to remain in the UK as he has
       been in the UK for over 14 years, and has  completed  his  secondary
       schooling in this  country.  He  was  a  talented  footballer  as  a
       secondary student and played  for  the  Academy  of  Fulham  FC  and
       obtained professional contracts with Weymouth FC and Basingstoke  FC
       but was unable to take them up due to his immigration status. He  is
       also active within his community, with his  local  church  and  with
       charitable organisations. He spends most of  his  time  volunteering
       and playing keyboards and leading/ training choirs with churches and
       working with young people in community  organisations.  He  believes
       this work as a community worker keeps young people away from a  life
       of crime. He also spends time looking after  his  sisters'  children
       and thus helping with  their  child  care.  He  therefore  has  very
       significant ties with the UK and has spent more  than  half  of  his
       life here. If allowed to remain he would do university level further
       studies in music or sports science, and would do part-time  work  in
       retail or something similar to support himself financially.

   10. The claimant says he should not have to return to Ivory Coast as  he
       cannot remember much about that  country  which  was  devastated  by
       civil war at the time he left. His life would be shattered as he has
       close family life with his parents and siblings in the UK and has no
       one in the Ivory Coast as all his grandparents have passed away. His
       family members do not travel back to Ivory Coast, with the exception
       of his father who has travelled back on a  couple  of  occasions  to
       preach and stayed in a hotel. The place where  the  family  used  to
       live in the eastern quarters of Abidjan has  been  bulldozed  so  he
       could not return there. There are still  problems  of  violence  and
       fears for personal safety in that country.  He  thinks  his  parents
       would struggle to send money to support him there. He would  not  be
       able to obtain work there as  he  does  not  have  a  diploma  level
       qualification.

   11. He also says he should be allowed to remain as he is engaged  to  be
       married to a British citizen, Ms Andree Momhatche  Karell  Guei.  He
       has known her since he came to the UK and they have been dating  for
       the past two years. She was aware of his lack of immigration  status
       when their relationship commenced. They were engaged in  June  2015.
       They do not cohabit, as she lives in Wolverhampton, but  they  speak
       on the telephone every day and he visits her once a fortnight.  They
       plan to marry and live together in September 2016. Ms Guei does  not
       wish to live in the Ivory Coast which she regards as too  dangerous,
       and she does not want to leave her family in the UK or her work as a
       hairdresser in this country. She has lived in the UK since  she  was
       four years old. Ms Guei and the  claimant  have  agreed  that  their
       relationship would end if he were to be forced to return permanently
       to the Ivory Coast despite  their  very  strong  feelings  for  each
       other.

   12. Evidence supportive of the facts of the claimant's case as  set  out
       above is also provided in statements given by  his  father,  mother,
       his sister Grace, his sister Victoire, Victoire's husband Mr  Roland
       Die, and the claimant's fianc�e Ms  Karell  Guei.  In  addition  the
       following witnesses gave the following additional oral evidence.

   13. Mrs Ouya gave evidence that her brother had been killed in 2011, and
       her two sisters were in exile in Benin or Ghana. She explained  that
       she  had  untruthfully  said  on  her  application  form  for  entry
       clearance that her children, (including the claimant) were in France
       because she had said this when she was detained when she reported to
       the Immigration Service in 2008. She was afraid for her children  so
       made this up to protect them. She was sorry she had lied but felt it
       was natural for a mother to protect her children in  this  way.  She
       felt she had to continue the lie on  her  application  form  as  she
       still felt she needed to continue to protect her children.  She  was
       protecting her children as Ivory Coast was not a safe place for  her
       children to be at that time, and she believes this continues  to  be
       the case today.

   14. Mrs Ouya maintained that whilst she was abroad  applying  for  entry
       clearance she lived all of her time in Ghana  bar  one  month  spent
       with a French friend's family in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. She  had  had
       to write on the entry clearance form that  she  had  an  address  in
       Abidjan and say she lived there as she was not a Ghanaian citizen so
       could not say she lived in Ghana. She could not support the claimant
       in Ivory Coast because she was not working, and because he was of an
       age when he should be working and supporting her. She had high blood
       pressure and was not fit to work, and her husband was  also  unwell.
       He is provided with food by her and her  husband,  but  he  is  only
       given money and clothes by friends of his own age  from  within  the
       church.  The claimant would face return to an unstable country where
       he would not be able to work without doing further studies as he has
       no UK diploma which would enable him to access work.

   15. The Reverend Kousso gave evidence that when  Mrs  Ouya  returned  to
       Ivory Coast she was based in that country for her period of absence,
       although she travelled to Ghana a number of times to make  her  visa
       application and deal with the appeal. He said  she  was  based  with
       various acquaintances of the family  in  the  Yopougon  district  of
       Abidjan whom were known to them as he had been a pastor in that area
       before he travelled to the UK. His wife had made the arrangements on
       her arrival in Ivory Coast. The address on the form was  his  postal
       box address from the time when he  lived  in  Ivory  Coast.  He  had
       spoken on the phone to his wife every day whilst she had been there.
       He confirmed that his wife had lied  about  his  children  being  in
       France on her visa application form because she had told this lie to
       the Immigration Service when she was detained and felt  she  had  to
       continue with it. Likewise he had felt he had to continue with it at
       the appeal hearing. It had not been deliberate as his wife had  been
       in a scary situation and said what she had to protect her  children.
       He and she were both sorry for having told this untruth however.

   16. The Reverend Kousso gave evidence that he provides small amounts  of
       financial help, for instance bus fares, to  the  claimant  but  that
       others in the church pay for  more  expensive  things  such  as  the
       claimant's trips to Wolverhampton to see his  fianc�e.  He  and  his
       wife are reliant on income support, and have just �114 per  week  to
       support  themselves  and  so  cannot  really  support  the  claimant
       financially very much. He is on medication for high  blood  pressure
       and cannot do paid work outside his church role.

   17. Ms Guei gave evidence that she was not prepared  to  live  in  Ivory
       Coast as she wishes to remain with her mother in  Wolverhampton  who
       provides her with emotional and financial support.  She  would  also
       have problems working as she does not speak good enough French,  and
       is scared of the conflict in that country. The relationship with the
       claimant  would  have  to  end  if  he  was  sent  to  Ivory   Coast
       permanently. She was however happy to  support  an  entry  clearance
       application. She did not believe the  claimant  had  ever  lived  in
       France. She was not sure why  she  had  not  given  a  statement  in
       support of the  claimant  for  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal in July 2015 when she was engaged to the claimant  at  that
       time, but she may not have been able to attend the  hearing  due  to
       her work.  From August 2016 she will be paid �14,972  a  year  gross
       for her work (40 hours a  week  work  on  the  minimum  wage)  as  a
       hairdresser.

   18. The evidence also  includes  a  letter  from  Pasteur  Djatchi  from
       Kingdom Heirs Community Church who confirms the claimant has been  a
       member of the church since 2007, and has become a youth  leader  and
       voluntary worker. He confirms he is a gifted singer and pianist, and
       role model for other youth. 35 church members have signed a petition
       supporting the claimant staying in the UK.

   19. There is also a letter from  the  Family  Restoration  Centre  which
       confirms that the claimant works in their youth  department  in  the
       young  people's  activities  team;  and  another  from  the   Eglise
       Methodiste Francophone about his work for them  as  a  musician  and
       trainer for other young musicians. There is a  further  letter  from
       Rhema Word which confirms the claimant works for them helping with a
       youth choir and with sound engineering.

   20. The claimant has provided school certificates and qualifications and
       documents relating to work experience, football and medical  matters
       showing his residence for the years 2002,  2003,  2004,  2005  2006,
       2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014. An old tenancy agreement from 2005
       shows the claimant as a tenant with his parents and siblings.  There
       are other documents showing the rental agreement  and  accommodation
       address for Victoire Kousso and her husband Roland Die and some bank
       statements for the claimant's parents.

   21. Background materials relating to the Ivory Coast set out details  of
       the civil war in 2002 and on-going problems in 2011, 2013  and  2016
       when there were Al Qaida attacks on hotels in Ivory Coast.



Submissions - Re-making

   22. Mr Wilding relied upon the refusal letter and oral submissions.

   23. Mr Wilding submitted that the claimant  and  his  parents  were  not
       credible witnesses. There was a discrepancy between  what  Mrs  Ouya
       and Reverend Kousso had said about where Mrs Ouya had  lived  whilst
       she was obtaining entry clearance. There was also a question  as  to
       whether the claimant had in fact been in France in the  period  July
       2008 to May 2010, as Mrs Ouya had said he  was  on  the  application
       form for entry clearance in 2008 and Reverend Kousso likewise at the
       appeal hearing in 2009, given the lack of  documentary  evidence  to
       place him in the UK at that time. Ms Guei's credibility  had  to  be
       considered given she had not given evidence  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal despite being the claimant's fianc�e at that time.

   24. In summary Mr Wilding argues that the claimant would not  have  very
       significant obstacles to integration in Ivory Coast because  he  had
       lived in Ivory Coast until he came to the UK at the age of 12  years
       and therefore had  knowledge  and  day  to  day  experience  of  the
       country's society, culture and  traditions  at  that  time.  He  has
       continued to have contact with these traditions and culture  through
       his church and Ivorian community activities in London. He would have
       no communication barrier as he clearly speaks French. He could  rely
       upon friends in that country for help integrating, and  continue  to
       receive financial support from his father and brother-in-law in  the
       UK. It was clear that the family still  had  acquaintances  who  had
       assisted his mother when she was in the Ivory Coast,  and  that  the
       claimant's father still continues to  occasionally  travel  to  that
       country for his work. The claimant may also have lived in France  as
       an  adult  showing  an  ability  to  change  country.  There  is  no
       background country of origin evidence which shows that the  claimant
       could not work without a diploma in Ivory Coast.

   25. The Secretary of State argues that an appeal outside  of  the  Rules
       should not succeed as the claimant had built his private  life  ties
       with  the  UK  whilst  he  had  no  permission  to  remain  and   in
       circumstances where he had no reason to believe he would be  allowed
       to stay in this country, and so little weight  should  be  given  to
       these ties. The claimant would be able to use his experience in  the
       Ivorian community in London to integrate in the Ivory Coast and  can
       speak French to communicate there. He will  have  financial  support
       from his father and brother-in-law, and has not shown he  would  not
       be able to obtain employment using his UK qualifications.  He  could
       continue to be able to have involvement with church,  community  and
       musical organisations in Ivory Coast. He could keep in touch with UK
       friends and family  via  modern  methods  of  communication.  It  is
       doubtful that the claimant  and  his  fianc�e  have  a  family  life
       relationship given that they do not cohabit at the current time. The
       claimant's contribution to the UK through his charitable work in the
       UK and his  period  of  six  years  residence  as  a  child  are  of
       insufficient weight to mean that he is entitled to  succeed  in  his
       appeal, particularly given the  delay  in  the  claimant  trying  to
       resolve his status after becoming an adult in 2006.

   26. Mr Gilbert submitted in summary as follows. It is accepted that  the
       claimant cannot succeed under  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
       family life (following a discussion with myself and Mr Wilding).  He
       argues however that  the  claimant  could  demonstrate  having  very
       significant obstacles integrating if removed to Ivory Coast  due  to
       his period of residence in the UK starting as  a  child  and  during
       which his family has severed their ties with Ivory Coast. He has  no
       family or friends to turn to in that country, or home to go  to.  He
       has no experience of that country as an adult. He had no  experience
       of paid work in any country or of living alone away from his family.
       He would be at a disadvantage in the labour market without a diploma
       level qualification.

   27. It is also argued by Mr Gilbert that the claimant's appeal ought  to
       be consider under the wider law  relating  to  Article  8  ECHR  and
       allowed on the basis that his removal would be  disproportionate  to
       his Article 8 ECHR rights. His period of six years  residence  as  a
       child should be given weight as he had put down significant ties  to
       the UK during that time. He may have delayed in  trying  to  resolve
       his status until 2011 but he has remained integrated in his original
       family and so this is understandable. If the claimant were to return
       to apply for entry clearance to join  his  spouse  that  application
       would be refused as his  fianc�e/  wife  will  not  be  earning  the
       �18,600 required by the Immigration Rules.

Conclusions - Re-making

   28. The first issue to consider  is  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
       evidence of the witnesses before me. Reverend Kousso  and  Mrs  Ouya
       both have admitted telling untruths to the  authorities  previously.
       Reverend Kousso says  he  gave  wrong  evidence  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal about the whereabouts of his children at his  wife's  entry
       clearance appeal in 2009. Mrs Ouya  says  she  lied  to  Immigration
       Officers at Electric House in 2008 and also on her  entry  clearance
       form in 2008 about her children's whereabouts, and on the same  form
       about her place of residence.

   29. I find I can give no weight to Mrs Ouya's evidence as she says  that
       she lied previously to protect her children  from  being  found  and
       returned to the Ivory Coast. She clearly still feels that it is  not
       in the claimant's best interests to go back to the Ivory Coast,  and
       it is therefore clearly possible that she would  feel  justified  in
       giving evidence again that she believed would support  his  case  to
       remain even if it  were  not  correct.  Her  evidence  was  also  at
       variance with her husband with respect to her whereabouts whilst she
       was not in the UK and applying for entry clearance between 2008  and
       2010; the address on the application form; and whether they provided
       the claimant with any financial support.

   30. I am however satisfied that Reverend Kousso gave  credible  evidence
       to the Tribunal before me. Whilst showing understandable loyalty  to
       his wife and to her wish to protect their children, he  freely  gave
       balanced evidence that the family did have access to  a  network  of
       acquaintances in Abidjan, as a result of his previous  work  in  the
       church there, who had supported his wife by providing  accommodation
       whilst she applied for entry  clearance  and  has  accepted  he  has
       travelled to the Ivory Coast in his role as a pastor on a couple  of
       occasions. He also gave a coherent explanation of the address on his
       wife's visa application form being his old postal box  address.  His
       evidence was measured: for instance he accepted  that  he  did  give
       small amounts of money to the claimant but explained, with  coherent
       reasoning, that given his reliance on income support  and  his  ill-
       health that he and his wife were not in a position  to  provide  any
       greater sums.

   31. I find  the  claimant  and  his  fianc�e  Ms  Guei  to  be  credible
       witnesses. Their evidence  was  consistent  with  that  of  Reverend
       Kousso and  each  other,  and  was  consistent  with  their  written
       statements. They also gave their evidence in a careful, reasoned and
       measured manner to the Tribunal.

   32. It is next necessary for me to decide whether the claimant has  been
       continuously resident in the UK since 2001 or  whether  he  spent  a
       period between July 2008 and May 2010 in France.  The  Secretary  of
       State has pointed correctly that there is  no  documentary  evidence
       placing the claimant in the UK during this period. It is however the
       evidence of all three credible witnesses that he was present in  the
       UK during this period. Reverend Kousso has given a coherent  account
       as to why the falsehoods about the claimant being in France were put
       forward. The claimant has explained that as he was  living  at  home
       with little money and unable to lawfully study  or  work  he  became
       depressed and hence has no documents to show for his presence during
       this time.  On the balance of probabilities I am satisfied that  the
       claimant remained in the UK during this period and did not  live  in
       France at any point.

   33. I must now proceed to consider  firstly  whether  the  claimant  can
       succeed under the Immigration Rules at paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi):  to
       do so he would have to show that there  would  be  very  significant
       obstacles to his integration in Ivory  Coast  if  he  were  made  to
       return there.

   34. If returned to Ivory Coast the  claimant  could  turn  to  the  same
       community of people whom his mother relied upon when she was  forced
       to go back to the Ivory Coast for 18 months in 2008. This  community
       assisted his mother  with  accommodation  because  of  his  father's
       historic work with them as a pastor, and there has been no  evidence
       as to why they would not be willing to do the same for the  claimant
       in the short and medium term. He could also receive financial  help,
       in the short term, via remittances from the congregations in  London
       whom he has assisted with his voluntary work in London, and who  are
       currently able to assist him financially here. He would also be able
       to forge new friendships with a church community in Ivory Coast  who
       could provide him  with  spiritual  and  emotional  support.  He  is
       evidently integrated in the Ivorian Christian  community  in  London
       and thus despite leaving Ivory Coast as a young child has maintained
       contact with the traditions, customs and values of that community.

   35. There has been no evidence before me to explain why  in  the  medium
       term the claimant would not  be  able  to  obtain  work  to  support
       himself. I accept that he would not be able to obtain well paid work
       as he does not have a diploma or a degree but there is  no  evidence
       before  me  that  a  clearly  sensible,  hardworking  and   reliable
       bilingual young man with skills in sports and music could  not  hope
       to obtain some work in the Ivory Coast. Indeed  there  has  been  no
       evidence that he could not do as he intends to do in the UK:  obtain
       some relatively menial part-time work and at the same time study for
       a diploma which might lead to better paid work in the future.

   36. There is no evidence before me  that  despite  the  terrible  recent
       history of civil war in the Ivory Coast that at the current time the
       country is dangerous or unstable so as to mean  the  claimant  would
       suffer very significant obstacles to integration. The  evidence  put
       to me about the current situation  in  Ivory  Coast  is  simply  one
       Guardian newspaper article from April 2016 about a terrorist  attack
       on a seaside town called Grand-Bassam 40km from Abidjan in which  at
       least 16 people died at  the  hands  of  Al  Qaida's  North  African
       branch. There is reference in that newspaper article to the  Foreign
       Office Travel Advice to Ivory Coast which advises against all travel
       to the western part of the country  but  not  to  the  part  of  the
       country in which Abidjan is situated. The Foreign Office advice does
       say that there is  a  high  threat  of  terrorism;  there  could  be
       indiscriminate attacks; and that violent crime could take  place  at
       any time.  However there are no reasons given by the claimant as  to
       why he would be at particular risk from such attacks.

   37. Taking all the above conclusions into consideration I  find  on  the
       balance of probabilities that the claimant has not  shown  he  would
       have very significant obstacles to integration on  return  to  Ivory
       Coast. Whilst I realise he does not wish to go there and his  family
       want him to remain with them in London in the UK these matters,  and
       his long period of integration in his community in London,  are  not
       matters which have been shown to be in any way relevant  to  whether
       he would face problems with re-integrating in the Ivory Coast.

   38. I find that there are compelling matters, not considered  under  the
       Immigration Rules, particular the claimant's long residence  in  the
       UK from his arrival as a twelve year old  child  and  his  extensive
       private  life  connections  with   this   country   and   charitable
       contributions to this country which mean that it is  appropriate  to
       consider the appeal under the general  law  relating  to  Article  8
       ECHR. Clearly the claimant has very extensive private  life  in  the
       UK, which includes all of his family relationships, and his  removal
       would interfere with those relationships and his  UK  based  private
       life. This interference would, however, be in  accordance  with  the
       law as the claimant cannot meet the Immigration Rules.

   39. In considering the proportionality of the claimant's removal outside
       of the Immigration Rules I have regard to s.117B of the Nationality,
       Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 when considering the proportionality
       of his removal from the UK. In accordance with s.117B(2) and (3)  of
       the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  I  note  that  the
       claimant speaks fluent English and I am confident that he  would  be
       financially independent if allowed to remain in  the  UK  given  his
       existing qualifications; his aptitude for hard-work;  and  extensive
       voluntary work experience. I must regard these  however  as  neutral
       factors in accordance with Forman (ss 117A-C considerations)  [2015]
       UKUT 00412 (IAC).

    40. I note that weight must be given to the maintenance of immigration
        control  in  accordance  with  s.117B(1)   of   the   Nationality,
        Immigration and Asylum Act  2002,  and  thus  the  fact  that  the
        claimant cannot meet the Immigration Rules, is therefore a weighty
        factor against him.


    41.  I  note  that  in  accordance  with  s.117B(4)  and  (5)  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 little weight  should
        be  given  to  his  private  life  ties  to  the  UK  and  to  his
        relationship with Ms Guei, even  if  she  can  be  said  to  be  a
        qualifying partner, as all of this  has  been  formed  whilst  the
        claimant has been precariously and unlawfully present in  the  UK.
        Miah (section 117B NIAA 2002 - children)  [2016]  UKUT  00131(IAC)
        makes plain that the fact that the  claimant  established  private
        life whilst precariously and unlawfully present as a child for the
        first six years of his stay in the  UK  makes  no  difference:  it
        still should be accorded little weight as this is what  parliament
        has said should happen. However Miah then goes  on  to  note  that
        this does not mean that in particular cases that an examination of
        the individual facts might not lead to a finding that removal  was
        not proportionate when all factors are weighed in the balance, and
        paragraph 26 of that decision draws a distinction between  private
        life which can be replicated in the country of origin and  private
        life that cannot; and also a distinction  in  relation  to  family
        ties and issues of special vulnerability.

   42. Given the period of residence of the claimant in the UK is now  more
       than 14 years, and given the first six years of this were as a child
       during his important teenage years where he matured to  an  adult  I
       find it is relevant to look very closely at the individual facts  of
       this case.  I find the claimant was brought to the UK at the age  of
       twelve years at a time when the Ivory Coast  was  in  a  sudden  and
       violent civil war which included street fighting  in  Abidjan  where
       the claimant lived.  The  background  materials,  for  instance  the
       Observer Special Report dated 15th December 2002  are  corroborative
       of this fact. It was entirely understandable that his parents  would
       have tried to bring  him  to  join  his  father,  who  was  lawfully
       resident in the UK, and would have also taken  steps  to  bring  all
       other family members to London. It is regrettable that they were  so
       unsuccessful in making an  application  which  met  the  Immigration
       Rules thereafter. It is however notable that whilst the family,  and
       after his majority the claimant himself, may have been dilatory  and
       possibly incompetent in making applications, and at  one  point  his
       mother and father told an untruth about his whereabouts, there is no
       evidence or submission that the claimant went to ground or hid  from
       the authorities. I find he has been living openly with his family at
       their address for his entire stay in the UK.

   43. In the UK the claimant has completed his entire secondary education,
       and obtain BTEC qualifications in sport and performing arts. He also
       has passed GCSEs in French and Spanish. He was intensively  involved
       in football and played for the Academy of Fulham FC  and  thereafter
       obtained professional contracts with Weymouth FC and Basingstoke FC,
       but was unable to take them up due to his immigration status.  After
       leaving school he  has  put  together  an  impressive  portfolio  of
       voluntary work with church music and Christian youth groups, and  is
       now working in this way six days a week. Those he  has  worked  with
       have found him to be trustworthy, honest  and  hardworking.  He  has
       lived continually with his  family,  mostly  his  parents  but  with
       significant time spent with his  sisters  and  their  families.  His
       parents and siblings are now all lawfully resident: his parents both
       being British citizens, as is one  of  his  sisters  and  the  other
       sister is present as an EU family member with a residence  card.  He
       now has a fianc�e who is a British citizen, with whom  he  does  not
       yet cohabit but whom I find he plans to marry in September 2016  and
       from that time to share her flat in Wolverhampton.

   44. Whilst  I  find  the  claimant  could  replicate  the  private  life
       charitable work relationships, friendships and church bonds  he  has
       established in the UK in the Ivory Coast he clearly could not do the
       same with his close  bonds  with  his  parents  and  siblings  whose
       residence, citizenship and work ties them to this country.  These  I
       find to be "private" life  relationship,  and  not  Article  8  ECHR
       "family" relationships. This is because it has not been argued  that
       there are more than normal emotional ties between this 27  year  old
       claimant and his blood family relations. This is not in any  way  to
       diminish the relationships: they are very close and committed but as
       the  claimant  and  his  family   do   not   have   any   particular
       vulnerabilities they lack sufficient dependency  to  be  given  this
       legal definition. It is clear that the claimant would in  fact  also
       lose his future relationship with his fianc�e if removed from the UK
       as she is quite reasonably not prepared to live in the  Ivory  Coast
       due to the distance from her family; difficulties  for  her  working
       there; and the security risks in that country. That said it  is  not
       the case that I find there  would  be  insurmountable  obstacles  to
       family life between the claimant and Ms Guei  taking  place  in  the
       Ivory Coast. Ultimately it  would  be  possible  for  them  to  make
       sacrifices relating to contact with parents and siblings, Ms  Guei's
       work and a lesser degree personal security and lead a family life in
       that country.  The degree of hardship involved has  not  been  shown
       before  me  to  be  of  sufficient  level  to  meet   the   exacting
       insurmountable obstacles test of very serious hardship.

   45. The issue of proportionality is therefore extremely finely  balanced
       in this case.  I  take  into  account  the  need  for  there  to  be
       compelling  circumstances  not  sufficiently   recognised   by   the
       Immigration Rules to allow the appeal  outside  of  the  Immigration
       Rules on Article 8 ECHR grounds, in accordance with the decision  in
       SS (Congo) v SSHD [2015] EWCA Civ 387 at paragraph 40.

   46. This is a case which like Miah involves a significant period of time
       in the UK when private life was established as a child,  and  during
       which the unlawfulness of the claimant's presence  was  not  of  his
       choice and which had understandable initial protection  motivations.
       Miah was not successful in his appeal but in his case it  was  found
       he was able to use what he had gained through his  UK  residence  to
       rebuild a private life in his country of nationality in very similar
       form to that he had achieved in the UK. I find that this is not  the
       case for  this  claimant:  if  returned  to  the  Ivory  Coast  very
       significant parts of his private life, relating to all of his family
       members and fianc�e, cannot be reconstructed there.

   47. I have found it relevant also to  consider  Jeunesse  v  Netherlands
       (2015) 60 EHRR 17.  Whilst Jeunesse v Netherlands is  an  Article  8
       ECHR  family  life  case  it  clearly  looks  at  when  special  and
       individual circumstances require discretion to be exercised to grant
       a residence permit to someone who has  been  unlawfully  present  on
       Article 8 ECHR grounds. Like the applicant in Jeunesse v Netherlands
       this claimant's presence has been tolerated by the state authorities
       for a similarly long  period  of  time  whilst  he  repeatedly  made
       unsuccessful applications to remain and during which he  established
       strong family, social and cultural ties in this  country.  Like  the
       applicant in Jeunesse v  Netherlands  his  family  members  are  all
       citizens of this country (or those  with  Community  law  rights  to
       remain) who could not without considerable hardship relocate to  the
       Ivory Coast.

   48. Whilst having regard to s.117B (1), (4) and (5) of the  Nationality,
       Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  on  consideration  of  all  the
       circumstances of this case, as  set  out  above,  I  find  that  the
       claimant's removal would not be a  proportionate  interference  with
       his right to respect to private life.

Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal with  no  findings
      preserved.

   3. I remake the appeal allowing it on human rights grounds.

Annex A

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

    Introduction



     1. The claimant is a citizen of Ivory Coast born on 5th December 1988.
        He says he arrived in the UK with his mother in October  2001  when
        he was 12  years  old.  Starting  in  2003  he  made  a  number  of
        applications for indefinite leave to remain which were all refused,
        and had an appeal to the First-tier Tribunal which was dismissed on
        3rd January 2007. He made a human rights application  on  16th  May
        2012 which was refused on 12th February 2015.  His  appeal  against
        the decision to was allowed by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Greasley
        after a hearing on 23rd July 2015.

     2. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal by Judge of
        the First-tier Tribunal Pooler on 25th  November  2015  as  it  was
        arguable the First-tier  Tribunal  had  erred  in  law  as  it  was
        arguable that there had been a  failure  to  consider  whether  the
        claimant could meet the Immigration Rules; and  because  irrelevant
        facts were arguably taken into consideration such as the claimant's
        inability  to  play  professional  football  due  to  his  lack  of
        immigration status and relevant factors were not given  weigh  such
        as the funding of his education via public funds and  his  lack  of
        any immigration status.

     3. The matter came before  me  to  determine  whether  the  First-tier
        Tribunal had erred in law

Submissions - Error of Law

     4. Mr Melvin relied upon the application for permission to appeal.  In
        summary it is submitted in these grounds that  firstly  the  First-
        tier Tribunal erred in law for failing to start the examination  of
        Article 8 ECHR with consideration of the claimant's case under  the
        Immigration Rules, which was the correct approach as identified  by
        many cases of the Court of Appeal. In relation to the consideration
        outside of the Immigration Rules it is  said  that  the  First-tier
        Tribunal erred in a number of ways.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  had
        failed to show that the relationships of the claimant to his family
        were family life ones in accordance with Article 8 ECHR by  showing
        that there was sufficient emotional, and other, dependency  between
        him and his parents. It was wrong to  rely  simply  upon  financial
        dependency when he was unable to work. It was  also  irrational  to
        consider that the failure of the claimant to be able to  develop  a
        career as a professional sport's person due to his lack  of  status
        enhanced his private life. In addition it had not  been  considered
        that family here could support the  claimant  on  return  to  Ivory
        Coast. It was also  argued  that  it  was  not  material  that  the
        claimant had been involved in charitable and community work in  the
        UK; and that the Tribunal had erred as there was  no  reference  to
        the claimant being unlawfully residence and having accessed  public
        funds to which he was not entitled. Finally  there  was  no  proper
        consideration of the public interest, and there was  a  failure  to
        look at the reality of the claimant's  ability  to  be  financially
        independent.

     5. Mr Gilbert submitted that as no appeal  had  been  made  under  the
        Immigration  Rules,  and  as  there  was  no  need  to   apply   an
        intermediate test before proceeding to an  analysis  of  Article  8
        ECHR outside of the Rules that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  not
        erred in law in their approach.

     6. I informed the parties that I found that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        had erred in law. I set out  my  reasons  in  full  below.  I  also
        informed the parties that I would set aside  the  decision  of  the
        First-tier Tribunal. Both parties wanted me to retain the  remaking
        hearing, which I agree was appropriate.  Mr  Melvin  provided  some
        evidence to the Tribunal and the claimant regarding the  claimant's
        mother's  entry  clearance  application  in  2008  and  the  appeal
        relating to this heard in 2009.  There  was  insufficient  Tribunal
        time to re-make the decision so the hearing was adjourned.

Conclusions - Error of Law

     7. The First-tier Tribunal clearly erred in law by failing to consider
        the Article 8 ECHR appeal of the  claimant  under  the  Immigration
        Rules in the conclusions section of the decision  which  starts  at
        paragraph 21 of the decision.  It  is  clear  that  the  claimant's
        grounds of  appeal  make  reference  to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
        Immigration Rules at paragraph 2 and also  to  the  decision  being
        unlawful under Article 8 ECHR. The Court of  Appeal  have  held  in
        decisions from MF (Nigeria) v SSHD  [2013] EWCA  Civ  1192  onwards
        that in relation to a non-deportation Article 8 ECHR appeal first a
        Tribunal must consider whether an claimant can  succeed  under  the
        Immigration  Rules,  and  only  after  if  there   are   compelling
        circumstances not covered by the Rules (see  SS Congo & Ors v  SSHD
        [2015] EWCA Civ 387) will an analysis outside  of  those  Rules  be
        needed. It may have been that the First-tier Tribunal was  confused
        by the fact that the application in this case was made in May 2012,
        and thus prior to the new Article 8 ECHR Immigration  Rules  coming
        into force on 9th July 2012, however Singh v SSHD [2015]  EWCA  Civ
        74 makes it clear that for decisions made after 6th September  2012
        the new Rules are to be considered first by any Tribunal.

     8. I find that this legal error is material as  the  decision  of  the
        First-tier Tribunal contains no analysis of whether there would  be
        very significant obstacles to the claimant's integration  in  Ivory
        Coast, and thus whether he could  succeed  under  paragraph  276ADE
        (1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules. This also  affects  the  analysis
        and decision of the First-tier Tribunal outside of the  Immigration
        Rules as the consideration of the public  interest  in  maintaining
        effective immigration control in accordance with s.117B(1)  of  the
        Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 was incomplete as this
        required an analysis as to whether the claimant  could  meet  those
        Rules which are the basis of immigration control.

Decision:

   1. The making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law.

   2. I set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal with  no  findings
      preserved.

   3. I adjourn the remaking hearing.

Directions:

   1. Any further evidence to be submitted by either party should be  served
      on the other party and filed with the Tribunal 7  days  prior  to  the
      hearing date for the remaking hearing.
