Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr J Gajjar, Counsel instructed by Law Lane
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T Wilding, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellants appeal with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Nicholls promulgated on  23  June  2017  dismissing
    their appeal against the decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to
    refuse them entry clearance to the United Kingdom and to refuse a human
    rights claim.  The appeal is purely on human rights grounds.

 2. It is not in dispute that the first appellant is married  to  a  person
    present and settled in the United  Kingdom  nor  that  they  are  in  a
    genuine relationship nor that the second appellant who is the child  of
    both the couple is also part of the family unit.

 3. The decision to refuse entry clearance was  taken  as  is  accepted  on
    relatively narrow grounds that is that the  applicant  having  produced
    the relevant documents for the  purposes  of  Appendix  FM-SE  was  not
    genuinely earning the salary claimed which is  �22,400  which  is  just
    sufficient to meet the financial requirements of  Appendix  FM  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The reasons on which the  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    reached those conclusions are set out in the reasons for refusal notice
    and are in summary the result of  a  suspicion  that,  given  the  very
    sudden rise in the sponsor's income, that he was not  in  fact  earning
    �22,400 as claimed.  There was then a telephone conversation  with  the
    employer and as a result of that the Entry Clearance  Officer  was  not
    satisfied that the sponsor was in fact being paid the salary claimed.

 4. The appeal was lodged against that decision and the appeal then came in
    front of Judge Nicholls who heard evidence from the sponsor.   He  also
    heard evidence from the sponsor's employer.  The  judge  dismissed  the
    appeal, having looked at the income for the period up to and  including
    the tax year 5 April 2017 and concluding that  the  applicant  did  not
    take into account that twelve month period up until that date and  meet
    the financial requirements.

 5. The appellant sought permission to appeal and permission was granted by
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett on 3 November 2017, the judge noting
    it was arguable that the judge erred in requiring the appellant to show
    that the income threshold was met for a period of twelve  months  prior
    to the hearing rather than the six  month  period.   After  submissions
    between the parties it was agreed that the decision of  Judge  Nicholls
    did involve the making of an error of law in that the judge had  failed
    properly to consider the correct period.  It is  also  clear  that  the
    judge had failed properly to make findings of fact as to:

      i) whether the evidential requirements of Appendix FM-SE were met;

     ii) whether there was  evidence  to  show  that  the  letter  from  the
         employer met the requirements of Appendix FM-SE;

    iii) and perhaps most importantly, whether or not he accepted  that  the
         employment was genuine.

 6. After further  discussion  it  was  agreed  that  I  would  proceed  to
    determine the appeal and to make it again  without  the  need  to  hear
    further evidence.  It is I consider now clear  both  by  comparing  the
    appellants' bundle and the notes of the Entry Clearance  Officer  staff
    as read out into the record by Mr Wilding  that  six  wage  slips  were
    provided  and  six  relevant  bank   statements   provided,   therefore
    fulfilling the requirements of Appendix FM-SE.  It is also  I  consider
    clear that the evidential requirements in terms of a  letter  from  the
    employer were also met and again Mr Wilding took no issue on that.

 7. The sole remaining issue would therefore be in terms of the Immigration
    Rules as to whether the sponsor's employment is genuine.  I  note  that
    Judge Nicholls heard evidence from the  employer.   I  note  also  that
    there was evidence which is now not  in  doubt  that  the  sponsor  was
    earning income for which payslips are produced in respect  of  which  a
    P60 is produced.  It  is  also  of  note  that  these  match  the  bank
    statements which were also produced.  In the circumstances and  bearing
    in mind there appears to be no doubt in Judge Nicholls' mind  that  the
    employment was continuing and having examined the material provided for
    myself  I  am  satisfied  also  that  the   employment   was   genuine.
    Accordingly on that basis I am satisfied that the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules were met as at the date of decision.

 8. That however as it is a human rights appeal  is  not  the  end  of  the
    matter.  I  have  to  consider  whether  in  the  circumstances  it  is
    disproportionate to refuse entry clearance.  Having had due  regard  to
    the decision of the House of Lords in Razgar and applying the five step
    process in that I consider that the first four of the questions can  be
    answered in the affirmative.  The issue then remains as to  whether  in
    these circumstances it is nonetheless  proportionate  to  refuse  entry
    clearance.  Given that for the reasons I have given I am satisfied  the
    requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  are  met,  and  absent   any
    submission to the contrary, I do not consider that it could  rationally
    be said that a person who had met the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rule it was nonetheless proportionate to refuse entry clearance.  It is
    difficult to see how that could be proportionate  or  for  that  matter
    necessary or in the interests of immigration  control  given  that  the
    requirements of immigration control as set out in the Immigration Rules
    have been met and accordingly for these reasons I allow the appeal.

 9. In the circumstances, and I leave this only as a comment because I have
    no power to make a direction to the Entry Clearance Officer,  it  would
    be sensible for the Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  consider  again  the
    findings given that as I have found the Immigration Rules were met  the
    appropriate grant of entry clearance would not be on an Article 8 human
    rights basis but on the basis that in reality the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules had in fact been met.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and I set it aside.

 2. I remake the decisions by allowing it on human rights grounds.

Signed                                  Date 2 February 2018
