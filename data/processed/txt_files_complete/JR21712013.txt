                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                              APPROVED JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

    JUDGE Lindsley: The decision under  challenge  is  a  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse to grant discretionary leave  in  accordance  with
    the United Kingdom's obligations under Article 8 dated 6th August 2013.
     The  judicial  review  was  lodged  on  time  on  23rd  October  2013.
    Permission was refused on the papers by Upper Tribunal Judge  Coker  on
    4th December 2013, but granted after an oral hearing by Upper  Tribunal
    Judge Freeman on 23rd July 2015.

 2. The main  thrust  of  the  applicant's  history  is  as  follows.   The
    applicant is a citizen of India born on 20th October 1976.  He says  he
    entered the UK clandestinely on 19th  May  2003  using  someone  else's
    passport.  He says he has therefore been in the UK illegally for  about
    twelve years and eight months.  He says he was misled into believing he
    would be able to regularise his status and get work  in  this  country.
    He says that he should be allowed to  remain  here  with  discretionary
    leave as he does not have a passport or birth certificate, and thus has
    no means to return to India.

 3. It is notable that at points in his immigration history he  seems  also
    to have said that he was afraid of returning to India or felt he  could
    not do so due to lack of family,  and  at  the  hearing  before  me  he
    submitted some affidavits referring to a land dispute with his  brother
    and threats from that brother.

 4. In relation to the basis of application put forward  in  this  judicial
    review the applicant says he has no family or friends in India who  can
    get documents from his home country to assist  him  return  there,  but
    this strongly appears to be contradicted by  the  two  affidavits  from
    2013 submitted by him to me today indicating that he has  contact  with
    village elders and his mother.

 5. The core of the applicant's case is that he says that the  Indian  High
    Commission will not assist him obtain a passport and thus he  is  stuck
    in limbo in this country.  He has submitted information provided by the
    Indian High Commission  about  the  circumstances  in  which  they  are
    prepared to issue travel documents and passports which he says  do  not
    cover his circumstances. The applicant has also submitted a BBC  report
    entitled  "The  illegal  immigrants  desperate  to  escape  squalor  of
    Britain" dated 28th February 2012.  He says that these documents assist
    his argument that he should be allowed to remain as they are supportive
    of his claim to be unable to return to India.

 6. The applicant also points out that he has not resisted or  delayed  his
    removal by the respondent; that he has no convictions; and that he  has
    a network of friends in the UK which constitute his private life here.

 7. The applicant therefore challenges the decision  of  6th  August  2013,
    which he says was in  breach  of  the  respondent's  obligations  under
    Article 8 ECHR on the basis that she has failed to permit him to have a
    full and proper private life by issuing him with discretionary leave to
    remain.  He says he cannot return to his country of nationality so  the
    United Kingdom should provide him with documentation which  allows  him
    to work lawfully and thus to support himself,  and  to  have  a  lawful
    existence within society.

 8. The respondent challenges this claim in three ways.  It is said firstly
    that the applicant has not shown he is unable to obtain a  passport  or
    travel document as he has not shown that he  is  unable  to  obtain  an
    Indian passport or a travel document from the Indian High Commission or
    that he has tried to get any documents from India.

 9. Secondly the respondent has argued that there is a  process  to  obtain
    emergency travel documents from the Indian High Commission via UK Visas
    and Immigration and that this process will start once  the  removal  of
    the applicant has commenced.  It has also been  supplementarily  argued
    today that the respondent has services  for  those  who  wish  to  make
    voluntary  departures,  and  that  the  applicant  could  have   sought
    assistance from the respondent to make an "assisted voluntary  return".
    The applicant has never engaged  with  this  process,  although  it  is
    notable that  in  the  decision  letter  under  challenge  there  is  a
    telephone number which the applicant was advised to contact to  discuss
    his departure, and through that telephone number  he  would  have  been
    provided with "assisted voluntary return" information.

10. Thirdly the respondent contends that it would be wrong in principle  if
    people who evade controls should be rewarded for this  misdemeanour  as
    that  would  be  contrary  to  the  public  interest   in   maintaining
    immigration control.  As the  applicant  does  not  qualify  under  the
    Immigration Rules, and in the  light  of  s.117B  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 which means that little  weight  should
    be given to the private life of someone unlawfully in the UK, it  would
    not be appropriate to grant discretionary leave.

11. The respondent does not accept that this applicant would be entitled to
    seek leave under paragraph 353B. However it is pointed out  that  under
    this provision where a length of time is spent in  the  United  Kingdom
    for reasons beyond the migrant's control after a human rights or asylum
    claim has been submitted it may be appropriate to grant leave if  there
    are exceptional circumstances which mean  that  removal  is  no  longer
    appropriate.  The respondent contends that being in  limbo  is  not  an
    exceptional circumstance, however.

12.  The respondent has set out the more detailed reasons for rejecting the
    applicant's claim in a supplementary letter, which although  dated  1st
    October 2015 was in fact actually written on 30th  October  2015.  This
    letter adds to the original letter of 6th  August  2013  which,  it  is
    accepted, did not deal  with  the  issue  of  the  applicant's  alleged
    inability to return to India.  However, it is  said  that  any  initial
    failing is immaterial to the legality  of  the  decision  as,  for  the
    reasons set out by the respondent, this was not  a  basis  which  could
    ever have succeeded on the evidence provided by the applicant.

13. My conclusions on this matter are as follows.   The  contended  factual
    matrix of the case could possibly have led to three  legal  avenues  by
    which it might have been said that the respondent had acted  unlawfully
    in not granting leave to remain.

14.   Firstly, the case of Smirnova  v.  Russia  -  46133/99  24th  October
    [2003] held that where identity documents, in  this  case  an  internal
    passport,  were  withheld  by  the  Russian  state  which  led  to   an
    applicant's "civil death" (and in this case she was  unable  to  access
    medical care, employment and many other regular matters)  this  was  an
    interference with her private life, which on the facts of that case was
    an unlawful breach of Article 8 ECHR.

15. Secondly it is also relevant to consider that Lady Hale said  in  R  v.
    Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Khadir [2005]  UKHL
    39:

         "There may come a time when the prospects of the person ever  being
         able safely to return, whether voluntarily or compulsorily, are  so
         remote that it would be irrational to deny  him  the  status  which
         would enable him to make a proper  contribution  to  the  community
         here, but that is another question. It certainly did not  arise  on
         the facts of this case."

16. Thirdly, Article 1.1 of the 1954 United Nations Convention relating  to
    the Status of Stateless Persons defines a stateless person  as  someone
    who is not considered as a national by any state under the operation of
    its laws.  The  United  Kingdom  government  is  a  signatory  to  this
    Convention and it forms part of the Immigration Rules at paragraphs 401
    to 416.

17. It is patently clear from the facts of this case that  the  applicant's
    principal claim to a nationality and to identity and  travel  documents
    is from the Indian authorities (as this is the  country  where  he  was
    born and brought up and where his parents are citizens) and not the  UK
    where, at his own admission, he has simply lived unlawfully for  twelve
    years.

18. As argued by the respondent, this applicant has not shown that  he  has
    approached the Indian authorities (the Indian High Commission in London
    or the authorities in his former  Indian  state  of  residence)  for  a
    travel document to return to the country he acknowledges to be  one  of
    which he, at least historically, has been  a  citizen  and  a  habitual
    resident.

19. It is entirely insufficient for the applicant to  rely  simply  on  the
    general Indian High Commission advice on issuing passports to show that
    he would not be able to return and resume his rights as  a  citizen  of
    India. This is because it may be there are  processes  and  discretions
    not put in the general advice document by which he might be  granted  a
    travel document to return to India.

20. Similarly, the fact that other Indian nationals are destitute in the UK
    and not returned or accepted  by  India,  whilst  desperately  sad  and
    potentially unlawful, does not prove that the Indian authorities  would
    not assist this applicant in his individual circumstances.

21. In the case of Abdullah v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2013] EWCA  Civ  42  Beatson  LJ  referred  at  paragraph  26  to  the
    appellant's submissions based on the statement of Baroness Hale in  the
    Khadir case, and Sedley and Toulson LJJ in MS, AR & FW claiming that:

         "Leaving the appellant without status and consequently with limited
         access to healthcare, no right to  work  and  no  right  to  social
         security benefits deprived him of the ability  to  have  a  private
         life and left him in a sort of 'limbo'."

22. In response Beatson LJ made two points, first that if the 'limbo' issue
    ever did come play it  certainly  had  not  in  that  appellant's  case
    because:

         "Given the limited information provided by the  appellant  and  the
         inconsistencies in the accounts he  has  given,  the  Secretary  of
         State was entitled to further time to make inquiries."

23. The judge also emphasised at paragraph 27 that:

         "The time after which the 'limbo' argument can come into  play  may
         depend on the attitude of the individual concerned and his  efforts
         to establish his or her nationality or to obtain documentation."

24. If therefore this applicant wishes to pursue a challenge  such  as  the
    one he puts forward his first essential step would have been to produce
    an extensively documented case that the Indian High Commission and  any
    relevant home Indian state authorities had refused or ignored  repeated
    requests for assistance made in  person  (to  the  High  Commission  in
    London) and in writing (to both sets of authorities) by registered post
    or email, and that this material had been presented to the  respondent.
    The respondent  should  also  have  been  asked  to  intervene  on  the
    applicant's behalf with the relevant authorities  to  resolve  matters,
    with evidence of the applicant's own unsuccessful efforts.  It is clear
    from what has been said today that this would  include  a  request  for
    help with an "assisted voluntary return" in light  of  the  applicant's
    inability to make progress with the authorities himself.

25. The  passport  application  form  signed  on  17th  November  2015  and
    submitted to the Tribunal on 11th January 2016 could not show that  the
    decision made on 6th August 2013  was  unlawful.  It  is  in  any  case
    woefully  insufficient  in  constituting   enough   evidence   of   the
    applicant's determination to obtain his own documents to return to  his
    country  of  apparent  nationality  and  former  residence,   and   his
    additional duty to  try  and  obtain  assistance  to  return  from  the
    Secretary of State.

26. If such evidence as outlined above were collated I  find  it  could  be
    arguable that a person such as this applicant had  an  Article  8  ECHR
    claim under the Immigration Rules at paragraph 276ADE (1)(vi). This  is
    because it would be potentially arguable  that  there  would  be  "very
    significant obstacles to the applicant's integration into  the  country
    to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK", as it  would
    be arguable that he could not even reach that  country  to  begin  that
    process of integration.

27. In terms of statelessness a person such as the  applicant  has  serious
    obstacles to  overcome  in  showing  that  he  is  not  a  national  by
    "operation of its law" in the  light  of  the  authorities  of  Pham  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] UKSC 19 and R (on the
    application of Semeda) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    (statelessness; Pham applied) IJR [2015] UKUT 00658 (IAC).

28. No doubt the law of India provides for a person such as  the  applicant
    to be an Indian citizen given that he contends  that  he  was  born  in
    India  to  Indian  parents.   However,  it  may  be  that  if  entirely
    unreasonable or impossible procedural demands are shown to be  made  on
    the applicant to vindicate his entitlement to Indian  citizenship  that
    he would succeed in showing that the practice of Indian law operated so
    as to mean that he was not considered a national, and therefore had  an
    arguable right to remain under paragraph 403 of the Immigration Rules.

29. I repeat however that this applicant has come nowhere  near  assembling
    the factual basis to make such a claim to the respondent, and that  the
    decision under challenged dated 6th August  2013  cannot  therefore  be
    said to be an unlawful refusal to grant leave under Article 8  ECHR  on
    this basis.

Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal

30. I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of  Appeal  as  my  decision
    contains no errors of law.

Costs

31. The respondent is entitled to  reasonable  costs  to  be  paid  by  the
    applicant, which I have summarily assessed at �5,821.
