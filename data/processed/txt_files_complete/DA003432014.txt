For the Appellant:     Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R O'Ryan, Counsel instructed by Wilson Solicitors
LLP

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against the decision  of
   First-tier Tribunal Judge Bell to allow the appeal of  Mr  Faisal  Yassin
   against his deportation to Somalia. I shall for convenience refer to  the
   parties according to their status in the First-tier Tribunal: that is  to
   say, I shall refer to the  Mr  Yassin  as  "the  appellant"  and  to  the
   Secretary of State as "the respondent".

2. The background to this appeal may conveniently be summarised as  follows.
   The appellant left Somalia in 1994 at the age of 9 years. Having  entered
   the United Kingdom on the 2nd August 2002, the respondent granted  him  a
   short period of exceptional leave to remain in recognition  of  the  fact
   that he was an unaccompanied minor. The appellant was not however granted
   any form of leave to remain in the United Kingdom following his attaining
   the age of majority. The respondent nevertheless did not  remove  him  to
   Somalia due to the state of internal armed conflict that existed in  that
   country at that time. On the 13th February 2014, the  respondent  decided
   to deport him. That  decision  was  made  in  consequence  of  him  being
   sentenced, on the 11th December 2013, to  a  total  term  of  12  months'
   imprisonment in respect of an offence of burglary and breaching the terms
   of a Restraining Order.

3. Judge Bell concluded that whilst there  was  no  longer  a  situation  of
   internal armed conflict in Mogadishu, there was nevertheless a real  risk
   that the appellant would be destitute on return and that he thus entitled
   to international protection from suffering inhuman or degrading treatment
   in Somalia.  The following is a summary of the reasons that she gave  for
   that conclusion.

4. The appellant had left Somalia at the age of 9  and  had  therefore  been
   away from that country for around 21 years. He did not  have  any  family
   ties to Somalia. His only residual ties to that country  were  linguistic
   and cultural. He had had little education  or  experience  of  work.  The
   latter was due in part to the fact that he had not had permission to work
   for most of the time that he was in the United Kingdom and had thus  been
   dependent upon state benefits. Other than  a  possibility  of  "some  low
   level sporadic support" by way of  remittances  from  his  claimed  half-
   sister in the UK, he could  not  expect  financial  support  from  family
   members in the UK following his return to  Somalia  [paragraph  40].  The
   appellant had had problems with alcohol and depression in  the  past.  He
   would return to Somalia as an 'ordinary civilian' - that is  to  say,  he
   was not associated with the security forces, any aspect of government  or
   official administration, or any NGO or international organisation  -  and
   he would not be at risk of harm simply because he had resided in  Europe.
   Whilst the appellant had failed to establish that he was from a  minority
   clan, it would nevertheless be difficult for  him  to  obtain  assistance
   from his clan in Mogadishu given the length of his absence from and  lack
   of family ties to Somalia. These circumstances, combined  with  the  fact
   that he had a criminal conviction and history of mental  health  problems
   and alcohol abuse, meant he had little prospect of securing a  livelihood
   on return to Mogadishu.  This  in  turn  meant  that  there  was  a  real
   possibility of him living  in  inhumane  conditions.  The  appellant  was
   therefore exempted  from  what  would  otherwise  be  his  liability  for
   deportation under Section 32 of the UK Borders Act 2007.

5. The Respondent's grounds of appeal are lengthy and the Appellant's  Rule-
   24 response to them is lengthier still. They may however be summarised as
   follows. The essence of the  Respondent's  argument  is  that  the  judge
   failed adequately to explain why the Appellant would be unable to  access
   either majority clan support or the economic opportunities resulting from
   the economic boon in Mogadishu that was noted by this Tribunal in  MOJ  &
   Ors (Return to Mogadishu)  Somalia  CG  [2014]  UKUT  00442  [2012].  The
   appellant's response to this is that given his absence from Somalia for a
   period of over 20 years since the  age  of  9  years,  the  Tribunal  was
   entitled to find that there would not be any "clan associations" for  him
   to fall back upon. This finding was in keeping with the decision in MOJ &
   Ors, which was to the effect that return to Mogadishu is only  reasonable
   where an individual can expect to  benefit  from  a  meaningful   nuclear
   and/or extended family support or clan protection  mechanisms.  Moreover,
   the Tribunal's reasoning had been supported by  a  detailed  and  complex
   expert report, the contents of which the Respondent had never  sought  to
   challenge.

6.  It  is  important  to  remember  the  Country  Guidance  cases   provide
   guidelines. They are not tramlines, rigidly to be applied without  regard
   to the evidence that is before the Tribunal  in  the  particular  appeal.
   This is clear from the following passage in the headnote of MOJ & Ors -
           If it is accepted that a person facing a return to Mogadishu
           after a period of absence has no nuclear family or close
           relatives in the city to assist him in re-establishing himself
           on return, there will need to be a careful assessment of all of
           the circumstances. These considerations will include, but are
           not limited to:
           �       circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
           �       length of absence from Mogadishu;
           �       family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;
           �       access to financial resources;
           �      prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be
              employment or self employment;
           �       availability of remittances from abroad;
           �       means of support during the time spent in the United
              Kingdom;
           �      why his ability to fund the journey to the West no longer
              enables an appellant to secure financial support on return.

7. Judge Bell found - for reasons that are not in  fact  challenged  by  the
   Respondent - that the appellant was indeed without a  nuclear  family  or
   close relatives in Mogadishu to assist  him  in  re-establishing  himself
   following  his  return  to  Mogadishu.  She  thereafter  considered   the
   considerations that were relevant to the appellant's case with  reference
   to the specific evidence that was before her. Moreover, and  contrary  to
   the assertion that is made in both the grounds of appeal and the grant of
   permission to appeal, she fully explained why the  appellant  would  face
   difficulties in calling upon clan associations  for  assistance;  namely,
   his lack of family connections combined with his prolonged  absence  from
   Somalia. A Tribunal does not err in law simply  because  it  chooses  not
   'tick-off' each and every listed  consideration  in  a  Country  Guidance
   case. As with this case, many of those considerations overlap and/or  are
   interlinked. What is required is for the Tribunal to have regard  to  all
   the considerations that are relevant to specific facts of the appeal, and
   to reach a conclusion that is properly open to it upon  the  evidence.  I
   have no doubt that this was precisely what the Tribunal did in this case.
   I am therefore satisfied that Judge Bell did not make any error  of  law,
   whether material to the outcome of the appeal or otherwise.
