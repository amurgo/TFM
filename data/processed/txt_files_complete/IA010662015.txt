Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Shah, 786 Law Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Nath, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge  Sullivan  promulgated  on  13  May  2016  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal for further leave  to  remain  on  the
    basis of family and private life.


 2. Following directions made on 21 February 2017, the Respondent  has  now
    considered the further submissions provided by the Appellant.   I  have
    now received a letter dated 6 April 2017 from the Respondent, copied to
    the Appellant's representatives, which states as follows:


    "Having reviewed the immigration history the Secretary of State  agrees
    that ten years lawful residence has now been completed.   There  was  a
    period without leave following a late application but that  is  covered
    by the provision in 276B(v) covering periods of less than  28  days  or
    where an application was under consideration which was made  less  than
    28 days after expiry of previous leave.


    There being no  remaining  issue  in  276B  it  is  accepted  that  Mr.
    Siddiqui's appeal now falls to be allowed."


Error of law


 3. I found at the first hearing that the judge had made an error of law in
    paragraph 42 of the decision.  This was accepted  by  Mr.  Nath.   This
    relates to gaps in the Appellant's leave in 2006/2007,  and  2008/2009.
    The judge had not considered whether these periods were covered in part
    by section 3C leave.  Neither had he considered the 28 day grace period
    permitted by paragraph 276B(v).


 4. There  remained  the  period  in  June/July  2011.   As  stated  in  my
    directions promulgated on 16 January 2017, the materiality of the error
    of law in paragraph 42 depended  on  whether  there  was  an  error  in
    paragraph 41.  This paragraph states:


    "It is not clear when the Appellant's 2011 appeal rights were exhausted
    because I do not [know] what action (if any) he took after dismissal of
    his appeal in June 2011.  It seems likely to me that  the  29  day  gap
    between 20 June 2011 and 19 July 2011 would have been covered  to  some
    extent by leave under section 3C(2) of the Immigration Act 1971.  It is
    possible that the 19 July 2011 application for leave to remain was  out
    of time in which case there would  have  been  a  break  in  continuous
    lawful residence prior to the grant of leave on 27 September 2011."


 5. The Respondent has accepted that the Appellant did not break his  leave
    in 2011 for the purposes of paragraph 276B.  I find that  there  was  a
    gap of only 19 days from the date of dismissal of his appeal on 20 June
    2011 to the application made on 19 July 2011.   The  Appellant  had  10
    days in which to appeal to the Upper Tribunal and therefore  had  leave
    under section 3C until 30 June 2011.  There was then a gap of  19  days
    before his application, which is covered by paragraph 276B(v).


 6. I therefore find that there was no period  in  excess  of  28  days  in
    June/July 2011 when the Appellant was without leave.


 7. Further, in paragraph 40, the judge referred to the Appellant's witness
    statement being "silent as to the details of his overseas  travel  from
    the United Kingdom".  The Appellant provided  evidence  of  time  spent
    away from the UK in his letter of 27 January 2017.  He stated  that  he
    spent four weeks in Pakistan in August 2006, and five weeks in Pakistan
    in December 2007/ January 2008.  These periods are  not  in  excess  of
    those permitted under paragraph  276B.   The  Respondent  has  accepted
    this.


 8. I therefore find that the Appellant met the requirements  of  paragraph
    276B  of  the  immigration  rules,  which  has  been  accepted  by  the
    Respondent.   I find that the error of law in the calculation  of  gaps
    in the Appellant's leave is material.


 9. The Respondent's decision was in respect of the  Appellant  alone,  and
    subsequently  there  was  only  one  appeal  before  me,  that  of  the
    Appellant.  There were no dependents on his  appeal.   Given  that  the
    Respondent has accepted that the Appellant is entitled to  a  grant  of
    leave under paragraph 276B of  the  immigration  rules,  there  are  no
    remaining issues.


Decision and Remaking


10. The decision involves the making of a material error of law and  I  set
    the decision aside.


11. I remake the appeal, allowing it  under  the  immigration  rules.   The
    Respondent has accepted that the Appellant meets  the  requirements  of
    paragraph 276B of the immigration rules, and that he is entitled  to  a
    grant of leave to remain under this paragraph.


12. No anonymity direction is made.

Signed                                  Date 28 April 2017

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

I have allowed the appeal and a fee has been paid.  The  Appellant  did  not
provide all of the evidence regarding his ten  year  residency  until  after
the date of the decision.  In the circumstances I make no fee award.


Signed                                  Date 28 April 2017
