Representation:

For the Appellants:    Ms R. Stickler, Counsel, instructed by N C Brothers
                    & Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr T. Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellants, citizens  of  the  Philippines,  are  the  husband  and
    children of a British citizen, who sought entry clearance to the United
    Kingdom in order to join the sponsor.  Their applications were  refused
    on 9 January 2013 and they appealed unsuccessfully  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal whose determination  was  promulgated  on  14  December  2013.
    Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 17 January 2014 on all grounds.

2.   Both the Entry Clearance Officer and the First-tier Tribunal  concluded
    that the appellants failed to meet the following financial requirements
    of the Immigration Rules:-

         "E-ECP.3.1    The applicant must provide specified  evidence,  from
                  the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP.3.2, of -


                  (a) a specified gross annual income of at least -


                       (i)  �18,600;


                       (ii) an additional �3,800 for the first child; and


                       (iii)    an additional  �2,400  for  each  additional
                           child: alone or in combination with


                           (b)  specified savings of -


                               (i)  �16,000; and


                               (ii)  additional   savings   of   an   amount
                                   equivalent to 2.5 times the amount which
                                   is  the  difference  between  the  gross
                                   annual income from the sources listed in
                                   paragraph  E-ECP.3.2.(a)-(b)   and   the
                                   total amount required under paragraph E-
                                   ECP.3.1.(a);"

3.   The Entry Clearance Officer's stance was  recorded  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as follows:

         "4.  The Respondent's refusal letter dated 9.1.13 states in summary
             that the sponsor needs to show a  gross  income  of  at  least
             �18,600 for at least 6 months prior to the application.  There
             is submission of an annex 2 which confirms that he is  reliant
             on sponsorship from a third party, his brother and  sister-in-
             law which cannot be taken into  account.   The  Appellant  has
             provided wage slips that state that he earned �1,283  p.m.  in
             Hong Kong in 2012.  There is no  evidence  that  he  still  in
             employment  or  in  respect  of  his  income.   There  is   no
             submission of any savings that are held to meet the  financial
             requirements for entry clearance.  The application was refused
             under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the  Immigration
             Rules.  The Second and Third Appellants were refused  pursuant
             to Paragraph EC-C.1.1 of Appendix FM.


         5.   The Respondent's review dated 11.7.03 states that there is  no
             evidence of the proposed employment of  the  sponsor  and  her
             current payslip shows an  income  of  less  than  �1000  p.m..
             There is a fidelity investment portfolio which contains �15000
             but does not cover the 6 months period but  the  deposits  are
             not significant.  The sponsor has a  Hang  Seng  bank  account
             with a balance near to �30,000 over 6 months.  There  is  also
             �15,000 in an HSBC account but  the  combined  values  of  the
             accounts does not meet the threshold."

4.   The judge's findings were as follows:-

         "11. I have considered all the evidence in the round and I make the
             following findings.


         12.  The First Appellant has submitted further evidence in  respect
             of income and savings.  However, none of  this  satisfies  the
             financial  criteria  set  out  in  paragraph  9  above.    The
             sponsor's income is evidenced by 4 payslips for  September  to
             December 2012 which show an average monthly income of  10,000.
             This I presume to be Hong Kong dollars.  The  First  Appellant
             works and in January 2013 his income was confirmed by a letter
             to be $16000 p.m.   There  is  no  evidence  of  the  proposed
             employment of the sponsor.  I find that  the  First  Appellant
             has failed to establish the necessary income requirements.


         13.  I take the savings into account.   The  amounts  held  in  the
             Standard Chartered  Bank  accounts  are  small,  the  Fidelity
             investment portfolio does not cover a 6 month  period.   There
             is a substantial amount in the Hang Seng Bank over a  6  month
             period of a  balance  which  does  not  dip  below  $�330,000.
             However, the difficulty  remains  with  the  failure  to  have
             sufficient income."

5.   In R (On the application of MM) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department & Others [2013] EWHC 1900 (Admin),  Blake  J  made  findings
    concerning E-ECP.3.1, which are directly relevant to the issues in  the
    present appeals.  I am satisfied that I should regard those findings as
    persuasive, absent compelling argument to the contrary.  The fact  that
    MM is under appeal to the Court of Appeal is not per  se  a  reason  to
    depart from MM.  Blake J made findings regarding the lawfulness of  the
    relevant Immigration Rules in the context of British  citizens  wishing
    to live with their family in this country.  It is common  ground  that,
    in the present case, the sponsor is such a citizen.  Particular aspects
    of his judgment are as follows:-

         "130.    When  decision-makers  and  judges  assess  pre-July  2012
             applications for adequacy of maintenance,  particularly  where
             the maintenance limits rise because of dependent children, any
             short fall in proven  earnings  can  be  met  by  evidence  of
             capital resources.  Thus, suppose a person  with  a  dependent
             spouse and children needed to show an  income  of  �15,000  to
             meet the income support subsistence level test then applicable
             could only show part-time earnings of �12,500; such  a  person
             could make  good  the  difference,  if  at  the  time  of  the
             application, there were cash assets  of  �6,250  available  to
             support the couple for the full  thirty  month  period  before
             next review.  It was not necessary  that  savings  of  �16,000
             first had to be shown before  regard  could  be  had  to  such
             savings. This approach will still apply to classes  of  people
             exempt from the new requirements.


         131. If a similar approach had been permitted on  the  new  �18,600
             target, particularly if limited to  the  first  twelve  months
             before review, then if a claimant such as MM could demonstrate
             savings of �3,000 when added to his �15,600 income,  he  could
             meet the threshold to permit his wife to come to the  UK.   To
             inform a low earner that there is fairness and flexibility  in
             the scheme because they can count any savings over �16,000  to
             add to their low  earnings  seems  a  rather  cruel  piece  of
             mockery: how is a person earning the minimum  wage  likely  to
             accumulate savings of �16,000?  For a sponsor with  no  income
             at all that would mean �16,000 plus  �18,600  x  2.5  years  =
             �62,500.  Moreover  this  requirement  is  additional  to  the
             statutory prohibition on access to income support  or  similar
             benefits whilst a person  has  limited  leave  to  remain.   I
             recognise that the Secretary of State's case is  that  she  is
             looking for long-term economic viability of families after the
             spouse has acquired settlement five years after entry, but  if
             so  it  seems  to  me  that  examination  of   the   financial
             circumstances of the couple at the end of the five year period
             when the earning capacities of both parties can be taken  into
             account is the time to make  the  assessment  rather  than  to
             front load these substantial  financial  burdens  on  a  self-
             sufficient but low-paid earner before the spouse is admitted.


         144. Nevertheless, the rights are of  such  fundamental  importance
             and the effect of the five aspects on  which  I  have  focused
             attention  are  so  intrusive,  that  I  conclude  that  taken
             together they are  more  than  is  necessary  to  promote  the
             legitimate aim.  The substance of this claim is both the human
             rights of the sponsor claimants to enjoy  respect  for  family
             life and the constitutional right of the  British  citizen  to
             reside in the country of nationality without let or hindrance.
              From this perspective the application of the  combination  of
             the five factors to people in the position of these  claimants
             is not merely disproportionate as a matter of human rights law
             but also an irrational and unjustified restriction  on  rights
             under  the  law  relating  to  recognised  refugees  and   the
             constitutional rights of British citizens.


         145. I do not accept the claimants'  case  that  the  Secretary  of
             State was required to adhere to the rule 281  (v)  formula  in
             all cases of entry clearance application by spouses of British
             citizens  and  recognised  refugees.   She  was  justified  in
             concluding that greater resources than �5,500 per annum for  a
             couple without children and adequate accommodation were needed
             in pursuit of the aims she has identified.  It may be that the
             �18,600 minimum income without recourse to  other  sources  of
             funding would be within the limits of the Secretary of State's
             margin of appreciation in setting the terms in  which  foreign
             sponsors can bring in their spouses and partners, even  though
             this represents a radical  departure  from  the  norm  in  the
             European Union based on the Family Reunion Directive.


         146. However, I conclude that this measure is disproportionate when
             applied  to  British  citizens  and  recognised  refugees.  In
             particular, it is more intrusive in its restrictions on family
             life to ensure that couples are self sufficient at the time of
             the spouse's first admission,  and  are  above  the  level  of
             recourse to public funds at the end of the  five  year  period
             when  the  spouse's  application  for  settlement   is   being
             considered.


         147. There are a variety of  less  intrusive  responses  available.
             They include:


             i.   reducing the minimum income required of the sponsor alone
                  to �13,500; or thereabouts;


             ii.  permitting any savings over the �1,000 that may be  spent
                  on  processing  the  application  itself  to  be  used  to
                  supplement the income figure;


             iii.      permitting  account  to  be  taken  of  the  earning
                  capacity of the spouse after entry or  the  satisfactorily
                  supported maintenance undertakings of third parties;


             iv.  reducing to twelve months the period for  which  the  pre
                  estimate of financial viability is assessed."

6.   I am entirely satisfied that the First-tier  Tribunal  in  the  present
    case erred in law in that the judge misapplied the  relevant  financial
    requirements by confusing the issues of  "income"  and  "savings".   In
    particular, at [13] of the determination, the judge accepted  that  the
    appellants had a "substantial amount" of savings covering the  relevant
    six month period prior  to  the  application  but  failed  to  consider
    whether such savings were sufficient to meet the requirements.   It  is
    clear that E-ECP.3.1(b) permits the financial requirement to be met  by
    a combination of income and savings.

7.   As a result of that error of law, I have decided  to  set  the  judge's
    determination aside,  so  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  can  re-make  the
    decision in the appellants' appeals, which I now proceed to do.

8.     Ms  Stickler's  oral  submissions  have  been  modified  by   written
    submissions, received after the hearing, in  which  she  very  properly
    drew my attention to an omission in her skeleton argument, to which she
    spoke at that hearing. Those written  submissions  were  copied  to  Mr
    Melvin, who has responded in writing to me, copied to counsel.

9.    If one applies the requirements of E-ECP.3.1  without  regard  to  the
    judgment in MM, the sum needed by the appellants is �24,600 (�18,600  +
    �3,800 + �2,400).

10.  Although Mr Melvin questioned the income of the sponsor, I  agree  with
    Ms Stickler that the evidence on this issue is such that I should  have
    regard to it. The income is �9,240 per  annum.  Thus,  the  deficit  is
    �15,360. Savings as specified by  E-ECP.3.1(b)  therefore  need  to  be
    shown, if the appellants are to meet the requirements of the rules. The
    formula contained in that sub-paragraph requires the sum of �16,000  to
    be aggregated to 2.5 x �15,360 (�24,600 - �9,240) = �54,400.

11.   There was a disagreement between the representatives  at  the  hearing
    regarding the evidence of savings that was before the  entry  clearance
    officer  and  the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge.  Having  examined   the
    materials, however, I agree with Ms Stickler at paragraphs 9 and 10  of
    her skeleton argument that both the savings in the Hang Seng  Bank  and
    the account (543-7-0267420 fall to be taken into consideration, as,  in
    both cases, there was evidence in respect of the  requisite  six  month
    period. The total savings  were,  thus,  as  stated  in  Ms  Stickler's
    skeleton argument: viz. �25,421.90 + �14,140.62 = �39, 562.52.

12.   As can be seen, this total amount of savings falls well short  of  the
    �54,400 required by the rules.  The appellants can, therefore,  succeed
    only by successfully invoking MM.

13.  MM is a decision carrying considerable persuasive force. The fact  that
    it is under appeal does not per se affect that force.  The  difficulty,
    rather, lies in determining how, if at all, it falls to be applied in a
    particular appeal, such as the present case.

14.   Mr Melvin submitted that what Blake J had to say about ways  in  which
    the rules might be made "less intrusive" [147], even if correct, was in
    the context of Article 8, as it bears in the case of a sponsor who is a
    British citizen. Mr Melvin pointed to the fact that the sponsor in  the
    present case, although British, had spent little  time  in  the  United
    Kingdom and that the family had lived together in Hong Kong.

15.   There is some force in that submission,  and  I  shall  revert  to  it
    shortly.  But,  the  real  difficulty,  as  it  seems  to  me,  in  the
    appellants' case is that it amounts to an invitation to  the  judiciary
    to re-write the detailed requirements of the immigration rules in  ways
    that will almost inevitably lack consistency and which risk being  seen
    as akin to the discredited "near miss" principle (see Patel [2103] UKSC
    72).

16.  In so saying, I am aware Blake J said at  [148]  that  his  conclusions
    were in part designed to assist

          "judges of the First-tier and Upper Tribunal  who  will  have  the
          difficult task of determining on the basis of particular facts  as
          found or are undisputed whether Article 8 requires  the  admission
          of the particular person".


         However, I do not consider that observation was intended to  be  an
    invitation to judges, as opposed to the respondent, to take a  view  as
    to precisely what financial level should be set by  the  rules  in  the
    case of a particular  appellant.  Rather,  it  seems  to  me  that  the
    judicial assistance envisaged by Blake J comes down to  the  following.
    In determining the proportionality of any interference with  Article  8
    rights stemming from the refusal of entry  clearance,  having  assessed
    the weight to be placed on the appellant's side  of  the  balance,  the
    weight to be placed on the respondent's side may fall to be  diminished
    (and so produce a result in the  appellant's  favour)  if  and  to  the
    extent that the respondent is relying on aspects of  the  rules,  which
    Blake J identified as problematic (or "intrusive").


16.   The present case provides a good instance of  the  problems  with  the
    approach described in paragraph 15 above. It is plain from  [147]  that
    Blake J was not finding that certain specific requirements of the rules
    had to be rewritten by the respondent in order to make  them  generally
    compatible with Article 8. His list of "less  intrusive"  responses  is
    non-exhaustive. It is also evident that Blake J was not saying that all
    four items on the list had to be adopted by the respondent.

17.   In the present case, even if, as Ms Stickler submits, I were  to  read
    the reference to 18,600  as  if  it  were  a  reference  to  Blake  J's
    suggested figure of �13,500 in [147](i), the sum  required  in  savings
    would be �45,100 (�16,000 + (�11,640 x 2.5). That sum is still well  in
    excess of the savings of �39,562.52.

18.   Accordingly, in her post-hearing written submissions, Ms  Stickler  is
    forced to make the submission that Blake J's judgment is authority  for
    the proposition that, as well as  reducing  the  sum  of  �18,600,  the
    "savings" sum of �16,000 should be ignored, as well as  the  multiplier
    of 2.5. [131] of the judgment is said to be  authority  for  the  first
    proposition,  whilst  [147]  iv  is  a  distillation  of  the   judge's
    observations on the second proposition. If one does all this, then,  Ms
    Sticker says, the required savings were only �15,560.

19.   With respect to Ms Stickler, this will not do. Adopting  the  approach
    I have described at paragraph 16 above, I accept that, the stronger the
    Article 8 case, the more one might need to "read  down"  the  intrusive
    rule requirements. But the present appeals have not been put forward on
    the basis that there is a pressing human rights need for family reunion
    in  the  United  Kingdom.   Significantly,   Ms   Stickler's   original
    submissions, as contained in her skeleton argument, sought only to rely
    on the suggested �13,500 figure. The inclusion of the sums relating  to
    the child appellants has had the  result  that  reliance  only  on  the
    �13,500 figure is no longer enough to get  the  appellants  the  result
    they want. But the absence of a weighty Article 8 case in favour of the
    appellants means there is no basis for reading down the �16,000 or  2.5
    multiplier requirements, in order to produce a result  that  is  not  a
    disproportionate interference.

9.   The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of  law.
     I set it aside and substitute a decision of  my  own,  dismissing  the
    appeal of the appellants.
