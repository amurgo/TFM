Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A R Islam, of Counsel of the Chambers of Aminul R
Islam
For the Respondent:    Ms C Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals with permission against a decision  of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Thorne, promulgated  on  3  February  2017,  in
    which he dismissed the appellant's appeal against  a  decision  of  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to  refuse  him  entry  clearance  to  come  to
    Britain as a spouse, on the basis that  the  sponsor  had  insufficient
    income to meet the requirements of the Rules.  The judge in paragraph 4
    of the determination  stated  that  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  had
    alleged that the appellant's wife's  income  was  only  �15,674.22  per
    annum rather than  the  required  �18,600.   In  paragraph  20  of  the
    determination he wrote:

         "20. It seems to me that on S's own evidence her gross  income  for
             the 12 months prior to  the  date  of  application  (13/04/15)
             could not have been in  excess  of  �18600.   She  produced  a
             letter from HMRC at p.39 of A's bundle which showed  that  for
             the tax year  2014-2015,  (which  is  almost  exactly  the  12
             months' period prior to the date of application) her pay  from
             Amblex Ltd was �12600 and her pay from Ms Hussain Co  Ltd  was
             �2130.22.  She confirmed that these figures were  correct  and
             constituted her entire income during that  period.   She  also
             produced payslips and bank account statements which  supported
             what she said.  It is clear to me therefore  that  her  income
             was below the requisite threshold."

2.   The grounds of appeal argued that the judge had erred  when  concluding
    that the appellant did not meet the financial requirements in the Rules
    because what was required was evidence of the sponsor's  income  during
    the six months prior to the application and the issue  was  whether  or
    not that evidence was consistent with  the  claim  that  the  sponsor's
    annual salary would meet the threshold of the financial requirement  of
    �18,600.

3.   At the beginning of the hearing Ms Everett and Mr Islam considered  the
    documentary evidence.  Once she had gone through the payslips  provided
    cross-referenced to the sponsor's bank statements Ms  Everett  accepted
    that the documentary evidence for the six months prior to the  date  of
    application showed that the sponsor had an income in excess of �18,600.
     She therefore conceded that not only had the judge made  an  error  of
    law in that he had taken into account  the  sponsor's  income  for  the
    twelve months prior to the date of application and therefore  reach  an
    erroneous figure for her annual income as at the  date  of  application
    which should have been determined by considering the  sponsor's  income
    over the six months  running  up  to  the  date  of  application.   She
    therefore accepted that the sponsor met the financial  requirements  of
    the Rules.  She therefore conceded, as the Entry Clearance Officer  had
    not raised any other issue, that the appeal should be allowed.

4.   For the reasons set out above I find that there is  material  error  of
    law in the determination of the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal and  I
    set aside his decision. As the decision of the ECO in not in accordance
    with the law and therefore the interference with the family life of the
    appellant is not proportionate, I re-make the  decision  allowing  this
    appeal not only  on  immigration  grounds  but  also  on  human  rights
    grounds.
