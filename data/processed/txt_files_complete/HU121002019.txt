                            DECISION AND REASONS

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms. A Everett, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr. Z Malik, Counsel, instructed by Advice Wise
Solicitors



Introduction

 1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State.  The  respondent,  whom  I
    shall refer to as 'the claimant', has  previously  been  successful  on
    appeal before the First-tier Tribunal in challenging a decision by  the
    Secretary of  State  to  refuse  to  grant  him  settlement  under  the
    Immigration Rules ('the Rules') on the grounds of 10  years  continuous
    residence.

 2. The decision of Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Shore  ('the  Judge')
    was sent to the parties on 20 September 2019.

 3. By a decision dated 28 January 2020 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    O'Brien granted the Secretary of State  permission  to  appeal  on  all
    grounds.

Remote hearing

 4. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing room at  Field
    House. The hearing room and the building were open to the  public.  The
    hearing and its start time  were  listed  in  the  cause  list.  I  was
    addressed by the representatives in exactly the same way as if we  were
    together in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this  constituted  a
    hearing in open  court;  that  the  open  justice  principle  has  been
    secured; that no party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as  there
    has been any restriction on a right or interest,  it  is  justified  as
    necessary and proportionate.

 5. The  parties  agreed  that  all  relevant  documents  were  before  the
    Tribunal. Mr. Malik relied upon written submissions dated 20 May  2020.
    The audio and video links remained unbroken between the representatives
    and the Tribunal throughout the  hearing.  At  the  conclusion  of  the
    hearing both  representatives  confirmed  that  the  hearing  had  been
    completed fairly.

 6. The claimant did not remotely attend the  hearing.  No  member  of  the
    public joined the hearing remotely or attended Field House.

Anonymity

 7. The Judge did not issue an anonymity direction and no request was  made
    by either party for such direction to be issued.

Background

 8. The claimant is a national of India who is now aged 33. He entered this
    country in February 2008 with entry clearance as a student, valid until
    30 September 2009. His leave was subsequently varied to leave to remain
    as a Tier 1 (Post Study Worker) Migrant and then as a Tier 1  (General)
    Migrant with the final variation of leave expiring on 3 July 2016.

 9. He made an in-time application for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier
    1 (General) Migrant on 22 June 2016 and prior to its  consideration  by
    the Secretary of State he varied his application on 17 January 2008  to
    one seeking indefinite leave to remain on the grounds of completing  10
    years' continuous residence in this country under paragraph 276C of the
    Rules.

10. The Secretary of State refused the application by means of  a  decision
    letter dated 3 July 2019, concluding that the claimant did not meet the
    requirements of paragraph 276B(ii) and 276B(iii)  of  the  Rules,  with
    reference to paragraph 322(5). The Secretary of State  observed,  inter
    alia:

         'When assessing your application of 17 January 2018 for  indefinite
         leave to remain on the grounds of long residence, consideration has
         been given to  your  previous  immigration  history  as  a  Tier  1
         (General)  Migrant  and  the  information  you  provided  to   HMRC
         concerning your income and earnings in the United Kingdom.

         In order to assess the Tier 1 (General) indefinite leave to  remain
         application we wrote to you  on  23  March  2017  asking  [you]  to
         complete a questionnaire  and  provide  evidence  to  support  your
         earnings claimed.

         You submitted documents for our consideration  on  19  April  2017.
         These documents have been considered by our department and  it  was
         concluded that you do not meet the requirements of paragraph 322(5)
         the Immigration Rules as detailed below.'

11. The Secretary of State noted that when the claimant applied  for  leave
    to remain in March 2011, he claimed 20 points  for  total  earnings  of
    �35,225.27. The Secretary of State further noted:

         'When reviewed, it was apparent to UKVI that the  earnings  claimed
         from self-employment you had declared to HMRC for the  tax  year(s)
         2009/10 and 2010/11 were significantly different to the information
         you had declared to UKVI.

         On 29 December 2011 you had  declared  to  HMRC  self-employed  net
         profit earnings of �7,239.00 in  the  tax  year  2010-11.  This  is
         �8,691.00 [less] than the figure declared to UKVI.

         Within the evidence you provided in support of your application you
         have demonstrated that there were errors in  the  tax  returns  you
         have previously submitted to HMRC for the year(s) 2010/11. You have
         also stated that you have  contacted  HMRC  [on]  24  May  2016  to
         resolve these errors and that you now have an updated tax liability
         figure from HMRC.

         The updated tax returns to HMRC show:

              . Tax year 2010/11: you have now declared  a  net  profit  of
                �15,930.00 for your self-employment.

         Your amended tax returns to HMRC are acknowledged and it recognised
         you have a revised tax liability figure from HMRC.'

12. Consideration was given by the Secretary of State as to the explanation
    provided by the claimant as to the discrepancy:

         'You have shown in the evidence submitted that errors were made  on
         your original HMRC tax returns in calculating your expenses, profit
         and loss and turnover.

         You have stated that the errors were because  of  "lack  of  proper
         information (as was my first attempt at doing so)".

         In addition you have stated:

         "Once I realised my error, I called HMRC and under their  guidance,
         corrected quickly and started paying  the  difference  in  tax  and
         penalties."

         Consideration has been given to the explanation provided.  However,
         it is clear that when applying for leave to remain you were able to
         confirm the level of profit you had made from  self-employment  you
         had received. It is not clear why, when submitting your tax returns
         over the same period, you would declare a different amount to HMRC.
         It is your responsibility to ensure that the requisite tax is  paid
         on your self-employed [earnings] and it is  questionable  that  you
         did not identify the  substantial  discrepancies  at  the  time  of
         submitting the  returns.  Your  explanation  for  these  errors  is
         therefore not accepted.

         Therefore, the Secretary of  State  is  satisfied  that  the  self-
         employed  earnings  you  had  declared  in  your  previous  Tier  1
         (General) applications are not consistent  with  your  declarations
         made to HMRC in the relevant tax period. Had you declared  earnings
         which were consistent with your declarations HMRC, you  would  have
         has (sic) overall  earnings  of  �26,534.27  and  scored  5  points
         instead of 20 points for your earnings reading to an overall  score
         of 65 points. You therefore would not have scored sufficient points
         under the Immigration Rules for leave to remain to be granted.

         Your actions in declaring different amounts of income to  HMRC  and
         UKVI lead to the conclusion that in light  of  your  character  and
         conduct it would be undesirable to  allow  you  to  remain  in  the
         United Kingdom. your character and conduct with regard to declaring
         your income would lead to  a  refusal  of  your  application  under
         General Grounds Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules. Whilst a
         refusal under Paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules  is  not  a
         mandatory decision, it is  considered  your  actions  in  declaring
         different income to HMRC and UKVI would mean that a  refusal  under
         Paragraph 322(5) is appropriate.

         The Secretary  of  State  has  considered  whether  the  particular
         circumstances of your case merit the exercise of discretion. Having
         considered those circumstances the Secretary of State is  satisfied
         that the  refusal  remains  appropriate  and  is  not  prepared  to
         exercise discretion in your favour."

Hearing Before the FtT

13. The appeal came  before  the  Judge  sitting  at  Taylor  House  on  17
    September 2019.  The  claimant  attended  the  hearing  and  gave  oral
    evidence. The claimant's evidence is recorded,  inter  alia,  at  [18],
    [22] of the decision:

         '18. He engaged Azza  Consultancy  Services  to  make  his  Tier  1
            application. The Home Office acknowledgement dated 23  May  2011
            of his application addressed to that  company  was  produced  at
            page A28. He provided details of  all  his  employed  and  self-
            employed  earnings  to  the  company  and  they  submitted   the
            application. The Home Office accepted  his  earnings  as  stated
            (which included self-employed earnings  of  �15,930.00  for  the
            period 12 August 2010 to 28 February 2011). His application  was
            granted on 23 May 2011.

         ...

         22.  The appellant says that the stress of his work and the  stress
            caused by his mother's  ill  health  and  his  sister's  failing
            marriage made him very stressed. He says he  could  not  make  a
            sane decision and decided to ask a  friend  with  experience  of
            business in India to help him with his tax return. He says  that
            he and his friend did not calculate the tax  due  on  his  self-
            employed  earnings  correctly  because  they  wrongly   included
            personal expenses such as rent, utilities and so on as  business
            expenses. That is  why  he  reported  his  net  income  as  only
            �7,239.00 for 2010/2011.'

14. The Judge concluded that the Secretary of State  had  not  relied  upon
    dishonesty when refusing the settlement application, at [62]-[63]:

          '62. Putting to one side, for the moment, the explanation  of  his
            actions by the appellant, I make a fundamental finding  of  fact
            in this case that the decision maker made no  finding  that  the
            appellant had acted dishonestly in the reasons for refusal.  The
            reasons speak of 'significant differences'  in  the  appellant's
            income as declared in his Tier 1 application and self-assessment
            for HMRC. The reasons also speak of inconsistency and state that
            'Your actions in declaring different amounts of income  to  HMRC
            and UKVI lead to the  conclusion  that  in  the  light  of  your
            character and conduct, it would be undesirable to allow  you  to
            remain in the United Kingdom.

         63. In the absence of a finding of dishonesty  by  the  respondent,
            the  authority  of  Balajigari  leads  me  to   the   inevitable
            conclusion that the respondent has failed to meet the burden  of
            proof on her to justify refusal under paragraph 322(5).'

15. In the alternative, at [64]-[65], the Judge reasoned that the  claimant
    had been given inadequate opportunity to present  his  evidence  as  to
    events before the Secretary of State made her decision because  of  the
    required use of a questionnaire:

         '64. I also find that there was no  evidence  before  me  that  the
            appellant had been told  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had  a
            suspicion that the appellant had acted dishonestly  and  he  was
            not given an opportunity to respond, both as regards the conduct
            itself and as regards any other reasons relied upon  as  regards
            'undesirability'  and   the   exercise   of   the   second-stage
            assessment. The appellant was simply sent a questionnaire  which
            gave no opportunity which gave no opportunity to comment on  any
            other reasons relied on  as  regards  'undesirability'  and  the
            exercise of the second-stage assessment. It follows that in  the
            absence of such a response being offered,  the  respondent  must
            have failed to take a non-existent response into account  before
            drawing the conclusion of reprehensible conduct.

         65. For these reasons alone, I find  that  the  appellant's  appeal
            must succeed, as  the  respondent  concedes  that  he  has  been
            lawfully  resident  in  the  United  Kingdom  (apart   for   the
            misconduct alleged) for more than ten years.'

16. Having decided as to the procedural impropriety  of  the  Secretary  of
    State only providing the appellant with an inadequate questionnaire  to
    respond to concerns the Judge allowed the appeal.

17. In the alternative, having found that the  claimant  succeeded  on  his
    appeal on article 8 grounds under the Rules,  the  Judge  proceeded  to
    consider the claimant's article 8 rights outside of the  Rules.  It  is
    presumed that this course  was  taken  as  an  alternative,  though  no
    express confirmation as to  such  approach  is  identified  within  the
    decision.  Having  considered  section   117B   of   the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, the Judge concluded at [74]:

         '74. I find that the decision  appealed  against  would  cause  the
            United Kingdom to be in breach of its obligations under  article
            8 of the  ECHR  because  the  appellant  has  shown  exceptional
            circumstances as set out in my findings above, and refusal would
            result in unjustifiably harsh  consequences  for  the  appellant
            such  that   refusal   of   his   application   would   not   be
            proportionate.'

Grounds of Appeal

18. The Secretary of State filed grounds of appeal, which are  detailed  in
    full below, raising three issues (identified at paragraphs 1-3, 4-5 and
    6):

         'Making a material misdirection in law

         1. The Tribunal found that the SSHD failed to meet  the  burden  of
            proof  on  her  to  justify  refusal  under   paragraph   322(5)
            (paragraph 63 of the determination) and the SSHD had committed a
            procedural  impropriety  by  not  giving   the   appellant   the
            opportunity  to  respond  to  the   allegation   of   dishonesty
            (paragraph  64  of  the  determination).  It   is   respectfully
            submitted that using  this  approach  the  Tribunal  misdirected
            itself in law and therefore reached unsustainable findings.

         2. The Tribunal's consideration of the  322(5)  decision  is  based
            upon Balajigari and Others v. Secretary of State  for  the  Home
            Department [2019] EWCA Civ 673. However, it  is  submitted  that
            the Tribunal has applied Baljigari incorrectly.

         3. At paragraph 62 of the determination the Tribunal found that the
            SSHD had made no clear findings  of  dishonesty  in  this  case.
            However, it is submitted that it is clear from paragraph  37  of
            Baljigari that the very use of 322(5) implies  such  a  finding.
            Indeed, it is submitted that such an approach  is  self-evident.
            Furthermore, it is submitted that  paragraph  37  of  Balajigari
            sanctions the use of 322(5):

             'We would accept that a matter of principle dishonest  conduct
             will not always and in every case reach a sufficient level  of
             seriousness, but in the context  of  an  earnings  discrepancy
             case it is very hard to see how the deliberate  and  dishonest
             submission of false earnings, whether to HMRC or to  the  Home
             Office, would not do so.'

            It is therefore submitted that the  Tribunal's  finding  is  not
            made out.

         4. With regard to the point on procedural fairness, the appellant's
            submission was that the Home Office guidance on Tier 1 cases had
            not been followed (paragraph 50 of the determination).  However,
            the decision under appeal on this case was  the  decision  under
            paragraph 276B, not  the  Tier  1  decision.  Nevertheless,  the
            Tribunal followed this approach and found that the appellant had
            been deprived of  the  opportunity  to  respond  to  the  322(5)
            allegation. It is submitted that this approach is incorrect.

         5. In Balajigari the  Court  of  Appeal  found  that  there  was  a
            procedural unfairness in the way that the  decisions  were  made
            because the applicants were not  given  a  fair  opportunity  to
            refute the allegations of deception or dishonesty  raised  under
            the general grounds for refusal (paragraph 105).  However,  that
            was for Tier 1 judicial review  cases.  This  finding  does  not
            apply to statutory appeals because if an  applicant  is  unhappy
            with the decision on their claim they can appeal  that  decision
            and provide additional new evidence. Therefore, this  procedural
            unfairness is not present in the statutory  appeals  system  and
            for the Tribunal is therefore clearly wrong in this case.

         6. Finally, at paragraph 74 the Tribunal found that the appellant's
            exceptional   circumstances   and   the   unjustifiably    harsh
            consequences   that   would   arise   from   removal   make   it
            disproportionate under article 8 to remove the appellant. It  is
            respectfully  submitted  it  is  not  clear  what  findings  the
            Tribunal  refers  to  here.  Furthermore,  the   proportionality
            assessment quite clearly does not take  account  of  the  points
            above which indicate that the appellant's dishonesty is a factor
            to be taken into account.'

19. In granting permission to appeal JFtT O'Brien reasoned, inter alia:

         '3.  It is arguable that, in finding that the  respondent  had  not
            satisfied her burden of proof because the refusal letter did not
            contain an express allegation of dishonesty, the Judge erred  by
            failing to consider whether there was evidence from which he  or
            she could conclude that the appellant had  been  dishonest.  The
            Judge, in taking into account the respondent's failure  to  give
            the appellant  notice  of  her  suspicions,  arguably  erred  by
            failing  to  consider  whether  he  had  provided  an   innocent
            explanation at the hearing.'

Decision on Error of Law

Ground 1 - has the Secretary of State alleged dishonesty?

20. This is an 'earnings  discrepancy'  case  in  which  the  claimant  has
    appealed against the refusal of indefinite leave to remain based on ten
    years' lawful residence under paragraph 276B of the Rules. The claimant
    contends that he has accumulated ten years' lawful residence under  the
    points-based system, primarily as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant,  having
    obtained  various  extensions  of  leave.  The  applications  for   the
    extensions as a Tier 1  (General)  Migrant  required  the  claimant  to
    declare a particular level of earnings. As detailed  above  the  reason
    for the refusal is not  that  the  claimant  did  not  meet  the  basic
    requirements of paragraph 276B, but on one of the 'General Grounds  for
    Refusal', paragraph 322(5):

         'Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter
         or remain in the United Kingdom are to be refused

         ...

         5.   the undesirability  of  permitting  the  person  concerned  to
            remain in the  United  Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
            (including  convictions  which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
            322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact   that   he
            represents a threat to national security.'

21. The Tribunal observes the conclusion of the Judge at [62]-[63] that the
    Secretary of State had not relied upon  the  claimant  being  dishonest
    when relying upon paragraph 322(5) of the Rules.  The  Judge  expressly
    found at [62] that the Secretary of State had 'made no finding that the
    appellant had acted dishonestly', with her  reasons  speaking  only  of
    'significant differences' in declared income. The finding made was that
    the refusal of the application, with reference to paragraph 322(5), was
    not founded upon 'dishonesty' and so the Secretary of State was  unable
    to meet the burden of proof placed upon her to establish dishonesty.

22. The Judge detailed Mr. Turner's closing submissions at [50]-[59] of his
    decision and the Tribunal observes that there is no  express  reference
    to Mr. Turner arguing that the Secretary of  State  had  not  expressly
    concluded that the claimant was dishonest in her decision  letter.  The
    Tribunal  has  enjoyed  the  benefit  of  considering  the  record   of
    proceedings and read relevant passages to the  representatives  at  the
    hearing. It is observed that there  is  no  express  reference  in  the
    record to Mr. Turner having raised  this  argument  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant before the Judge.  Further,  the  record  of  proceedings  is
    consistent with the Judge's note at [15] of his  decision  that  rather
    than assert from the outset that the decision letter was fatally flawed
    by not expressly addressing dishonesty, Mr. Turner  sought  to  address
    the relevant burden and standard of proof in a dishonesty matter:

         '15. At the start of the hearing, I discussed  the  issues  in  the
            case with the representatives. Mr. Turner submitted that it  was
            for the Secretary of State to establish dishonesty and  referred
            me to the decision of the Court  of  Appeal  in  Balajigari  and
            Others [2019] EWCA Civ 673. He suggested that,  because  of  the
            implications of a finding  of  dishonesty,  such  an  allegation
            requires a standard of proof 'at the higher  end  of  the  civil
            scale' ...

23. During her submissions before the Judge Ms. Lambert,  representing  the
    Secretary of State, expressly relied upon the decision  letter  and  to
    the  appellant's  'straightforward  deceit'.  She  observes  that   the
    claimant provided 'no innocent explanation', is 'evasive' and 'defaults
    to blaming friends'. At no point is  she  recorded  as  addressing  the
    purported failure by the Secretary of State to  expressly  declare  the
    claimant to have exercised dishonesty in her decision letter.

24. In such circumstances, the Tribunal is satisfied that at the very least
    the Secretary of State was not placed on notice as to this issue before
    the conclusion of Ms. Lambert's submissions and is  satisfied,  on  the
    balance of probabilities, that Mr. Turner did not actually  raise  this
    issue at the hearing. Consequently, the Judge's findings  at  [62]-[63]
    were made without the benefit of legal argument before him and  so  the
    approach adopted is erroneous in law. In JK (Conduct of  Hearing)  C�te
    d'Ivoire [2004] UKIAT 00061 Ouseley J, sitting as the President of  the
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal, confirmed the position to  be  adopted  by
    the judiciary, at [43]:

         43.  ... What is important, whether or not they are raised  by  the
            other party is that the [judge] should not develop  a  different
            case from that being present by the other party or pursue his or
            her own theory of the case.'

25. Mr. Malik acknowledged the contents of the record  of  proceedings  but
    submitted that such error was not material. He asserted that there  can
    be no implied finding or allegation of dishonesty in this case and  the
    Secretary of State must find  and  allege  dishonesty  'in  terms'.  He
    submitted that the Court of Appeal confirmed at [211] and [212] of  its
    judgment in Balajigari that  there  must  be  'a  positive  finding  of
    dishonesty' in the decision letter and that it is 'important that it be
    quite clear that such a  finding  has  indeed  been  made'.  Mr.  Malik
    asserted that any doubt as to the matter goes to the  claimant  and  in
    this matter the Judge, in the absence of any finding or  allegation  of
    dishonesty, was 'obliged' to allow the claimant's appeal.

26. Both representatives agreed that as to 'materiality'  in  circumstances
    where the Judge considered an argument not  advanced  before  him,  the
    Tribunal was to be satisfied that Mr. Malik's argument was a 'knock-out
    blow', namely  that  no  reasonable  Judge  could  come  to  any  other
    conclusion.

27. In Balajigari, at [4]-[6], the Court of Appeal records the Secretary of
    State's practice as to her reliance upon paragraph 322(5) of the  Rules
    in earnings discrepancy cases. Underhill LJ noted at [6]:

         6.   It is the Secretary  of  State's  case  that  his  policy  and
            practice is only to rely on Balajigari paragraph 322  (5)  where
            he believes that  an  earnings  discrepancy  is  the  result  of
            deliberate misrepresentation either  to  HMRC  or  to  the  Home
            Office,  in  other  words  only  where  it  is  the  result   of
            dishonesty. But a large number of migrants have claimed that  in
            their cases errors which were the result only of carelessness or
            ignorance have wrongly been treated as dishonest, and  that  the
            Home Office has been too ready to  find  dishonesty  without  an
            adequate evidential basis or a fair procedure ?."

28. In the decision letter the Secretary of State refers  to  'considerable
    discrepancies', 'significantly different' and  'not  consistent'.  Upon
    initial consideration, there may be merit to  Mr.  Malik's  submission,
    but I note Ms. Everett's perceptive  observation  that  the  claimant's
    legal representatives, and  the  claimant  himself,  prepared  for  the
    appeal on the basis that dishonesty was alleged, and Mr. Turner did not
    seek  to  argue  otherwise  at  the  hearing,  both  as  a  preliminary
    observation or in submissions. Mr. Malik conceded that  in  considering
    as to whether a 'knock-out  blow'  was  established  the  Tribunal  was
    entitled to take into account the fact the appellant's  counsel  before
    the First-tier Tribunal had not considered that this issue arose.

29. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the claimant is  not  capable
    of establishing, in circumstances where there was no  argument  on  the
    issue before the Judge, that he has a  knock-out  blow  such  that  the
    Judge's error was not material and the decision  should  stand.  Whilst
    acknowledging that the Secretary of State did not  expressly  refer  to
    dishonesty within her decision letter there is sufficient  detail  upon
    which the Secretary of State can reasonably seek to  persuade  a  judge
    that the concerns of the Court of Appeal in Balajigari, at [211]-[212],
    are not replicated in this matter. I further note [213] of the Court of
    Appeal judgment and observe that I did not hear full  argument  on  the
    point at the error of law hearing. Consequently, I  am  satisfied  that
    the Judge made a material error of law.

Ground 2 - Failure to give appellant notice of concerns

30. As an alternative to his conclusion that the Secretary of State had not
    found that the claimant had exercised dishonesty, the Judge found  that
    the claimant had not been  given  an  opportunity  to  respond  to  the
    Secretary of State's concerns as the questionnaire  was  an  inadequate
    means of addressing such concerns. The Judge concluded at [64]:

         64. ... The appellant was simply sent a questionnaire which gave no
            opportunity which gave no opportunity to comment  on  any  other
            reasons relied on as regards 'undesirability' and  the  exercise
            of the second-stage assessment. It follows that in  the  absence
            of such a response  being  offered,  the  respondent  must  have
            failed to take  a  non-existent  response  into  account  before
            drawing the conclusion of reprehensible conduct.

31. Mr. Malik accepted on behalf of the claimant that the Judge's reasoning
    on this issue was  defective,  noting  that  it  was  contrary  to  two
    reported decisions of this Tribunal concerned with the  appeal  process
    correcting the defects of justice identified by the Court of Appeal  in
    Balajigari.

32. Firstly, in R (Mansoor) v. Secretary of State for the  Home  Department
    (Balajigari - effect of judge's decision) [2020] UKUT 00126  (IAC)  the
    Tribunal confirmed that the process required by the Court of Appeal  in
    Balajigari can be carried out by the Tribunal in effect  applying  that
    guidance, such that  the  Secretary  of  State's  failure  is  rendered
    immaterial.

33. The Tribunal has further  confirmed  in  Ashfaq  (Balajigari:  appeals)
    [2020] UKUT 00226 (IAC), at [10]-[12]:

         10. In these appeals Mr Govan for the  Secretary  of  State  argues
            that the appeals process itself gives an opportunity to put  all
            relevant  facts  before  a  judge,  and  that   the   procedural
            difficulties faced by the Secretary of State in  the  Balajigari
            cases do not arise. Subject  to  one  important  reservation,  I
            agree. The landscape of appeal is very different  from  that  of
            judicial review. The appeal is  for  most  purposes  limited  to
            human rights grounds, but there needs to be  an  examination  of
            whether the appellant ought to have succeeded under  the  Rules.
            Thus  there  is  room  for  a  factual  investigation   of   the
            appellant's acts and motives and whether  paragraph  322(5)  was
            applicable to him. There is also a full opportunity for evidence
            to be adduced  and  considered,  whether  or  not  it  has  been
            deployed previously, on  both  the  underlying  events  and  any
            present factors going to article 8. What is more,  there  is  no
            free-standing ground of appeal that  the  decision  was  not  in
            accordance with the law.

         11. These points make it clear that where there  is  an  appealable
            decision, the role of the  Tribunal  will  be  to  undertake  an
            examination of the  evidence  and  decide  whether  the  refusal
            should be upheld or reversed, not on the grounds  applicable  in
            judicial review, but on determination of all the relevant facts.
            The appeal process fills both the gaps identified by  the  Court
            in Balajigari - the procedural fairness gap because  the  appeal
            gives the relevant opportunity, and the article  8  gap  because
            the appeal encompasses such human rights issues as  are  raised.
            By the end of an appeal process  the  appellant  has  had  every
            opportunity to put his case.

         12. I note, of  course,  what  the  Court  said  in  Balajigari  at
            paragraphs [59]-[61], that the opportunity to  make  submissions
            only after a decision has been made will usually be insufficient
            to meet the requirements of  procedural  fairness.  But,  for  a
            number of reasons, I do not think that those observations can be
            taken as applying to appeals of  this  sort.  First,  they  were
            specifically  made  in  the  context  of  judicial  review,   by
            reference  to  leading  authorities  on  judicial   review   and
            procedural  fairness,  and  including  observations  about   the
            limited  role  of  statutory  administrative  review,  which  is
            available only where there is no right of appeal.  Secondly,  it
            is not easy to detect any  reservations  of  this  sort  in  the
            Court's consideration of the possibility of affording a right of
            appeal in part C of its decision at [95]-[106], where the  scope
            of its observations would appear to be severely limited  if  the
            underlying decision on the  merits  were  to  be  considered  as
            potentially unlawful even  within  the  context  of  an  appeal.
            Thirdly, and most  important,  although  judicial  review  is  a
            remedy  lying  outside  any  specific  statutory   regime,   the
            statutory regime itself includes the right of appeal.  Where  an
            appealable decision is made the entire  process,  including  the
            notification of the decision to the  individual,  envisages  the
            possibility of the correction of the decision by an  appeal.  In
            this sense, the decision is not finally 'taken' until any appeal
            is over; and indeed, judicial review can have virtually no  role
            until an appellant has exhausted his right to have the  decision
            set aside on appeal.

34. The identified exception at [13] of  the  decision  in  Ashfaq,  namely
    where the was a judicial restriction imposed as  to  a  presumption  of
    dishonesty, does not arise in this matter.

35. Consequently,  the  failure  of  the  Judge  to  incorporate  into  his
    consideration the ability of the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  remedy  any
    failure, if such failure arose, to provide the claimant with the  means
    of explaining the circumstances results in there being a material error
    of law.

Ground 3 - article 8 outside of the Rules, failure to identify  'exceptional
circumstances'

36. Mr. Malik accepted  on  behalf  of  the  claimant  that  if  the  Judge
    materially erred as to  his  considerations  subjected  to  examination
    under grounds 1 and 2, his  short  conclusions  as  to  the  claimant's
    article 8 rights outside of the  Rules  could  not  stand  because  the
    exceptional  circumstances  found  to  exist  were  based  upon  flawed
    reasoning. The Tribunal confirms that Mr. Malik  was  correct  to  make
    this concession.

Remaking the Decision

37. Mr. Malik requested that this matter  be  remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. Ms. Everett confirmed the respondent to  be  neutral  on  the
    issue. I  have  given  careful  consideration  to  the  Joint  Practice
    Statement of the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal concerning  the
    disposal of appeals in this Tribunal. I am satisfied that the effect of
    the material errors identified above has been to deprive  both  parties
    of a fair hearing before the First-tier Tribunal and  so  it  would  be
    just to remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal:  paragraph  7.2(a)
    of the Joint Practice Statement.



Notice of Decision

38. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and I set aside the Judge's decision  promulgated  on
    20 September 2019 pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts
    and Enforcement Act 2007.

39. The matter is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing
    before any judge other than Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Shore.

40. No findings of fact are preserved.
