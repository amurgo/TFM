                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Thorne promulgated on the 11th January 2019 whereby  the
    judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the  decision  of  the
    respondent to refuse  the  appellant's  protection  claims  on  asylum,
    humanitarian protection and Article 2 and 3 grounds and to  refuse  the
    appellant's Article 8 claim based on family and private life.

 2. I have considered whether or not it is appropriate to make an anonymity
    direction. Having considered all the circumstances I do not consider it
    necessary to do so.

 3. Leave to appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Keane on 13th February  2019.  Thus  the  case  appeared
    before me to determine whether or not there was a material error of law
    in the decision.

 4. In granting leave to appeal the material part of the decision by  Judge
    Keane provides as follows:-

    The grounds amounted to no more than a disagreement with  the  findings
    of the judge, an attempt  to  reargue  the  appeal  and  they  did  not
    disclose an arguable error or errors of law but for which  the  outcome
    of the appeal might have been different.

    However I have perused the  judge's  decision  in  order  to  ascertain
    whether it disclosed "Robinson obvious" concerns. Two  concerns  arose.
    First although the judge confirmed at paragraph 24 of his decision that
    he heard evidence from the appellant's brother, Boshir  Ali  the  judge
    did not make findings of fact  in  respect  of  Boshir's  evidence.  In
    fairness to the judge I should acknowledge that at paragraph 53 of  his
    decision the judge referred to the part of Boshir's evidence  in  which
    he denied he was the appellant's brother and the judge made  a  further
    reference to Boshir's evidence which suggested the  discrepancy  as  to
    the amount of money which the  appellant  had  borrowed.  Such  concise
    references however do not amount to an adequate assessment of  Boshir's
    evidence and accordingly the extent to which  Boshir's  evidence  might
    fairly be said to have supported the  centrepiece  of  the  appellant's
    account namely that he came to the adverse attention  of  a  cousin  to
    whom he owed a substantial sum of  money.  Second  although  the  judge
    arrived at findings of fact which were negative to  the  appellant  and
    indeed found that the appellant had not given  a  credible  account  of
    events the judge did not presage such an assessment by reference to the
    background  evidence  of  conditions  prevailing  in  Bangladesh.  Such
    evidence was before the judge,  a  copy  of  the  respondent's  Country
    Policy and Information Note on Bangladesh 2018 was to be found at  page
    10 of the appellants bundle of documents and it was incumbent upon  the
    judge  to  take  into  consideration  the  background  evidence  before
    arriving at findings in respect of the appellant's credibility.

 5. It is on the basis indicated that Judge Keane suggest  that  there  are
    arguable errors of law.

 6. The original grounds of appeal themselves assert:-

     a) The judge did not take into account the evidence  as  a  whole  and
        that there  was  sufficient  in  the  evidence  to  show  that  the
        appellant had discharged the burden of  proving  that  he  owed  in
        excess of ï¿½10,000 to a relative in Bangladesh.  As  the  money  was
        still owed it was claimed that the appellant was at risk of serious
        mistreatment and that he had a genuine fear.

     b)  It is submitted that the judge has not taken into account the case
        of MA (Somalia) v SSHD [2010] UKSC  49.  The  judge  did  not  make
        findings on all aspects of the case and ignored the length of  time
        that had passed since the money was originally loaned. In assessing
        the risk the judge failed to take account of the CPIN  report  that
        in Bangladesh the police are under resourced and are  reluctant  to
        investigate people associated with the ruling political party.

     c) Proper consideration has not been given to the appellant's  private
        life and the interference that removal would have in  that  private
        life.

      Factual Background

 7. In essence the appellant's account was that he had borrowed money  from
    a family member, Koddus Ali [K], and K was now pressing  for  repayment
    including threatening the appellant. It was also claimed that K had now
    taken over the appellant's father's land.

 8. The judge noted that K lived next door to the  appellant's  family  and
    have not sought to harm them.

 9. Allegedly to avoid K the appellant had come to the United Kingdom on  1
    August 2005. The appellant had applied and been granted a one-year work
    permit visa. It does not appear that his leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom was extended. The appellant  became  an  over  stayer.  He  was
    served with papers as an immigration over stayer on 24  February  2010.
    It does not appear that  the  appellant  appealed  against  any  notice
    served at that stage or sought to  claim  asylum.  At  the  latest  the
    appellant was appeal rights exhausted by at the latest 21 May 2010.

10. The appellant did not claim asylum until 19 June 2018. By decision on 1
    November 2018 the appellant's application for international  protection
    was refused.

11. The evidence otherwise discloses that the appellant had a  wife  and  6
    children, who were still living in Bangladesh and who  were  living  as
    stated next door to K.

12. The judge had in detail examined  the  appellant's  account  and  noted
    material differences. The differences not only included the  amount  of
    money that had been borrowed but also as to whether the  appellant  was
    threatened when he was threatened and the circumstances of the threats.
    There are also discrepancies as to whether or not K was the brother  or
    cousin of the appellant. The  appellant  had  also  given  inconsistent
    accounts as to what he had done with the money in one instance spending
    10,000 in paying off an existing loan,  in  another  paying  10,000  or
    20,000 to buy land. Despite paying such a  huge  amount  of  money  the
    appellant appears not to have inspected the land and  appears  to  have
    been given forged title deeds to the land appears not to have  gone  to
    the police.

13. The appellant had asserted that K had started issuing the threat before
    he came to the United Kingdom in his oral evidence but  had  stated  in
    his asylum interview that the  threats  only  began  in  2016.  If  the
    threats only began in 2016 there was no reason  for  the  appellant  to
    remain between 2005 and 2016.

14. Appellant had called Boshir Ali to give evidence on his behalf. However
    Boshir Ali had given details which  are  again  inconsistent  with  the
    appellant's account, with regard to the relationship of  the  appellant
    to K and other details. The details were also inconsistent  as  to  the
    amount of money owed.

15. The judge has clearly compared the  various  accounts  that  have  been
    advanced by the appellant and Boshir Ali. Having done that,  the  judge
    was satisfied that the claims by the appellant  were  not  credible  by
    reason of the inconsistencies in the various accounts. The  judge  gave
    reasons for finding the claims with regard to land and money  were  not
    credible. That was sufficient to dispose of the appeal. The  judge  has
    considered the account of  Boshir  Ali  and  given  valid  reasons  for
    finding that that account was inconsistent  with  the  account  of  the
    appellant on core elements of the appellant's claim. The judge has made
    sufficient findings with regard to the evidence of Boshir Ali and given
    sufficient reasons for finding thereafter that the appellant's  account
    in light of all the inconsistencies was not credible.

16. With regard to the background information, given that the basis of  the
    appellant's claim was  not  credible  it  was  immaterial  whether  the
    background information was such as  to  identify  that  the  police  in
    Bangladesh were under resourced  or  whether  otherwise  the  appellant
    would not have a sufficiency  of  protection  or  would  be  unable  to
    relocate. If the appellant's account was not truthful there was no need
    for the appellant to seek protection from the authorities. Likewise  if
    the appellant's account was not credible there was no need for  him  to
    seek to relocate to another area in order to be safe.

17. The judge has given ample reasons  for  finding  that  the  appellant's
    account was not credible and therefore the appellant was  not  entitled
    to international protection.

18. Thereafter the judge  has  considered  the  article  8  rights  of  the
    appellant.  The  judge  has  carefully  considered  all  the   relevant
    circumstances and given valid reasons for finding that the decision was
    in all  the  circumstances  proportionately  justified.  The  judge  in
    paragraph 94 of the decision has set out factors both for  and  against
    the appellant's  private  life  in  the  United  Kingdom.  It  was  not
    suggested that the appellant had any family life here  as  pointed  out
    above his family appeared to be in Bangladesh.

19. Further to that the judge pointed out that the appellant had failed  to
    show that he could speak English, that the appellants private life  had
    been established at a time when the appellant  was  unlawfully  in  the
    United Kingdom in the main or otherwise his status was precarious; that
    there was no legitimate expectation  that  he  could  make  the  United
    Kingdom his home; and that otherwise  there  were  significant  aspects
    private life tying the appellant to the United Kingdom other  than  the
    fact that he had been here for a length of time . On the basis  of  the
    evidence the judge was entitled  to  conclude  that  the  decision  was
    proportionately justified.

20. The judge was entitled in all the circumstances to  conclude  that  the
    decision to refuse the appellant  further  leave  did  not  breach  the
    article 8 rights of the appellant.

21. In the circumstances there is no material error of law.

    Notice of Decision

22. I dismiss the appeal on all grounds.
