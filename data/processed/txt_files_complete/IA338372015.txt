Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Collins of Counsel, Douglas Simon Solicitors
                    (Earl's Court)
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. I refer to my Error of Law decision promulgated on 22nd  November  2018
    (attached) in which I directed the parties to file submissions  on  the
    question of jurisdiction of the Immigration and Asylum Tribunal.

 2. The facts and law are set out in detail in my decision of 22nd November
    2019 and I shall not repeat them here save to note that the appeal  was
    dealt with by First-tier Tribunal Judge Lingam  whose  engagement  with
    the aspect of jurisdiction was limited to consideration of whether  the
    notice of appeal was properly completed.   That  was  insufficient.  At
    paragraph 25 the judge did  acknowledge  that  the  Tribunal  had  been
    directed to consider the validity of the appeal as a 'mixed question of
    fact and law... it was not suitable to deal with it  as  a  preliminary
    consideration without full...evidence and or submission'.

 3. The judge proceeded at [31] to record

         'I am satisfied that the essential details  were  included  in  the
         appeal notice that incorporates a human rights  ground,  signed  by
         the appellant's legal representative.  I am  satisfied  that  those
         representing the appellant have also paid the requisite fee of ï¿½140
         for an oral hearing.  On those basis (sic) I am satisfied that  the
         appellant's appeal notice is valid'.

 4. That analysis was incomplete, and I directed  both  representatives  to
    make written submissions solely on the jurisdiction point.

 5. In writing, Mr Deller on behalf of the Secretary of State accepted that
    the appellant may have been employed on a personal basis as a matter of
    fact but it was unclear as to the decision under challenge. As  he  set
    out, the Appellant's case was that the document  issued  by  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer had the effect of conferring leave to enter until 8th
    January 2014 (when her  passport  expired)  and  that  the  appeal  was
    brought against an 'immigration decision' as defined in  section  82(2)
    of the 2002 Act as saved by the Commencement Provisions  for  the  2014
    Act. Even  if  the  appellant  had  been  employed  personally  by  the
    Ambassador of Lebanon from the outset the leave given would  only  have
    attracted, under paragraph 152 and 153, up to 12 months leave.   In  no
    circumstances would leave have been granted for five years (see Article
    3 of the Immigration (Leave to Enter  and  Remain)  Order  2000).   The
    appellant did not have leave to enter  until  January  2014.   She  was
    either exempt from control or was miscategorised as such. The Secretary
    of State's position was that she could not have had leave to  enter  or
    remain at 8th January 2014 notwithstanding any indication that she had;
    if she was in fact a private servant in  a  diplomatic  household,  she
    should have been issued with entry clearance.  She was not so issued.

 6. In written  submissions  Mr  Collins  noted  that  the  decision  under
    challenge was that of  the  25th  April  2014  which  stemmed  from  an
    application of 12th March 2014.  He asserted  that  the  appellant  had
    leave from the date she entered on 16th April 2009 to 9th January  2014
    (the date her passport expired) and her leave was extended by virtue of
    Section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 because of the  application  she
    made. The Tribunal was referred  to  BJ  (Singh  explained)  Sri  Lanka
    [2016] UKUT 00184 (IAC) such that where there was  leave  and  a  valid
    application and a person receives a negative decision that person has a
    right of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and will retain  Section  3C
    leave.  Where such a decision is  made  the  appellant  may  waive  the
    requirements of the Notices Regulations.

 7. For the reasons I give below I find that as the appellant did not  have
    leave and BJ and cannot assist the appellant.

 8. At the hearing on 11th March 2019 Mr Collins made oral submissions  and
    I was referred to R v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  ex
    parte Ram [1979] WLR  February  16.  This  held  that  where  an  Entry
    Clearance Officer has not been misled by the  applicant  into  stamping
    the passport with leave to enter indefinitely,  the  onus  was  on  the
    Secretary of State to show that the applicant was an  illegal  entrant.
    In that case, the fact that the Entry Clearance Officer had  mistakenly
    stamped the passport of the applicant  who  did  not  come  within  the
    categories of lawful entrants did not vitiate the  officer's  authority
    under Section 4(1) of the Immigration Act 1971 to grant leave to  enter
    the United Kingdom and the applicant was lawfully in the United Kingdom
    pursuant to that grant of leave.

 9. I was also referred to R (on the application of B) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department (recording of leave - date stamps)  IJR  [2016]
    UKUT 00135 (IAC) decided by the now President, Mr Justice Lane.    This
    held that someone who, by  misrepresentation,  induces  an  immigration
    officer to proceed  (to  grant  leave)  on  a  mistaken  basis  is  not
    automatically entitled to succeed, (for example a date stamp  recording
    a grant of leave under the  Immigration  Act  1971)  merely  because  a
    mistaken decision has been  formally  recorded.   By  contrast  even  a
    blameless individual will be unable to  obtain  benefit  from  a  stamp
    where there is no practice on the part of the  Secretary  of  State  of
    using a date stamp to record a grant of leave.

10. Mr Jarvis noted that much evidence had come 'after the  event'  of  the
    grant of exempt status.  Mr Deller was not identifying a mistake by the
    Entry Clearance Officer but that, on the information the appellant  had
    supplied at the time, she was considered visa exempt. Subsequently,  it
    would  appear  she  may  have  been  miscategorised,  but  not  on  the
    application itself.  Subsequently, she  did  not  make  an  application
    within the permitted time limit of 90 days (with the  possible  28  day
    waiving where she had overstayed).  Her leave had expired mid  November
    2013 (90 days after she had represented  that  she  was  working  in  a
    private capacity).  Her application and the ensuing refusal would  have
    been considered under the 'old' appeal regime, and,  as  she  was  visa
    exempt, she had no leave when she applied.

11. On the basis of the information supplied to the Entry Clearance Officer
    she was visa exempt. The decision of the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  as
    annotated demonstrated she was clearly visa exempt.  With  regards  the
    case of Ram, the Entry Clearance Officer had treated her as visa exempt
    and there was no avenue in law that the  applicant  could  'undo'  that
    grant. In any event, even if she had been given 'leave'  the  most  the
    appellant could have obtained was Leave to  Enter  for  12  months.  An
    applicant cannot request a visa to be classified as  a  different  visa
    retrospectively in this way.  There was no challenge at  the  time  and
    that would have been the avenue or remedy for the appellant  to  follow
    at the time.

12.  Mr Collins stated that the appellant had leave and was in  the  United
    Kingdom lawfully.  Mr Jarvis responded  that  she  was  in  the  United
    Kingdom with evidence of entitlement to exemption until her  change  of
    circumstances.

Analysis and Conclusion

13. The decision under challenge is that of  25th  April  2014.   That  was
    confirmed in the Notice of Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  Both  Mr
    Jarvis and Mr Collins agreed with that summation.

14. I am not persuaded that Ram or R (B) assist the appellant.   I  do  not
    consider  that  there  is  evidence  the  appellant  misled  the  Entry
    Clearance  Officer  or  that  there  is  a  mistake  in  the  type   of
    classification of the application; rather the reverse and it  is  clear
    from the application details recorded by the Entry  Clearance  Officer,
    and the only documentation available, that the 'EC Type' is  classified
    as 'D' and the payment detail  was  'Gratis:  7.4(a)  Persons  who  are
    exempt' - the appellant was not placed in  a  fee  category  consistent
    with 'diplomatic' exemption.   The sponsor's name was recorded  on  the
    application details as the 'Embassy of Lebanon', not a private name  of
    the Ambassador, and it would  also  appear  that  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer had access to the contract.  The annotated notes show that  the
    Entry Clearance Officer also applied the guidance.  The  applicant  was
    also considered to be 'Biometrics  Exempt'.   It  is  not  therefore  a
    question of the applicant misleading the Entry Clearance Officer as  in
    R (B).  The Entry Clearance Officer operated on the information he  was
    given, which came from the Lebanese Embassy (see below) and appeared to
    record and detail the application with some care.

15. Once granted, at no point  did  the  applicant  challenge  her  'exempt
    status' and she travelled in and out of the  United  Kingdom  with  her
    exempt status. By 2013, however, her solicitors applied on  her  behalf
    for leave to remain, but it was evident  that  by  this  time  she  was
    legally  represented,  and  submissions  made  that  she  was  employed
    privately and no longer exempt.   For the reason given in my  error  of
    law judgment  from  Paragraph  67  onwards  it  was  evident  that  her
    solicitors had reported on 16th August 2013 (and see page  382  of  the
    Appellant's  Bundle),  in  the  first  application  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant, that she was a  worker  in  a  private  household,  employed
    personally and thus no longer exempt. Indeed, in her witness  statement
    dated 25th June 2013, the appellant stated that she was

         'not entirely sure on what basis [she was] making  the  application
         as all the documents were completed on [her] behalf by the Lebanese
         Embassy'.

16. The letters  dated  4th  July  2013  and  13th  August  2013  from  the
    Ambassador, accompanying the August 2013 application, do not  undermine
    the approach taken by the Entry Clearance Officer, when the appellant's
    status/exemption from leave was originally given in 2009.

17. I find that the appellant was given  exempt  status  in  2009  for  the
    validity of her passport only, rather  than  conferring  'leave',  but,
    prior to the expiry  of  her  passport,  her  circumstances  must  have
    changed. From the time that she was no longer exempt she  had  90  days
    from 16th August 2013 (at the latest) to make a valid  application  for
    leave.  She did not do so.  Under Section 8A  of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971 she was to be

         'treated as if he had been given leave  to  remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom for a period of 90 days beginning on the day  on  which  he
         ceased to be exempt'.

18. Mr Jarvis accepted that she may have made an application even within  a
    28-day  period  after  the  90-day  period,  but  she  did  not.    Her
    representatives persisted in making an application on FLR  (O)  despite
    being told that the correct application was on a  Points  Based  System
    Form under Tier  5.   By  the  close  of  2013  the  appellant  was  an
    overstayer.  The Secretary  of  State  repeatedly  told  the  appellant
    through her representatives, that the  FLR  (O)  was  not  the  correct
    application and that a Tier 5 application should be made.  In BJ,  that
    application was not required to be made on a specific  form  and  there
    was no suggestion that the application was not valid.  That was not the
    case here.  The Secretary of State's response dated 25th November  2013
    to the application of August 2013 was clear that  the  application,  in
    line with paragraph 34 of the Immigration Rules, should be made on  the
    correct specified form PBS Tier 5 not FLR (O) form.  That advice was in
    bold. Her application was rejected.  The Secretary of  State  again  on
    18th December 2013 confirmed that there was no error in  the  rejection
    and that the Rules changed in November 2008 and the  correct  form  was
    PBS Tier 5 form not the FLR (O) form. A  yet  further  application  was
    filed on 3rd January 2014 and this once again was rejected  and  voided
    as an 'inappropriate application' on 11th February 2014. The  applicant
    was given numerous opportunities to rectify her application and  comply
    with the Rules.

19. The appellant had no leave by, at the very latest, the end of  December
    2013. Despite the application being made under Paragraph  159  on  12th
    March 2014 and which generated the  current  decision  asserted  to  be
    under challenge, she could not have fulfilled the requirements  because
    she was never given paragraph 159 leave in the first  place.   By  that
    time, she had no leave.

20. It was accepted by both parties that the right of appeal  was  governed
    by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as it applied prior
    to April 2015 regime.  Section 82 stated  that  where  an  'immigration
    decision' is made in respect of a person he may appeal to the Tribunal

         Section 82(2) 'In this part 'immigration decision' means-

         ...

         (d)      refusal to vary a person's leave to enter or remain in the
             United Kingdom if the result of the refusal is that the person
             has no leave to enter or remain

         (e)      variation of a person's leave to enter or  remain  in  the
             United Kingdom if when the variation takes effect  the  person
             has no leave to enter or remain.

21. Neither 82((2)(d) nor 82((2)(e) could apply to the appellant.  She  did
    not have Section 3C leave because  she  had  not  made  a  prior  valid
    application.  Even if she were given a type of leave, through  the  90-
    day grace period, and which Mr Jarvis  doubted,  by  the  date  of  her
    application in March 2014 she was an overstayer.

22. There was, as a result, no immigration decision and she had no right of
    appeal.

23. For these reasons, I  am  not  persuaded  that  either  the  First-tier
    Tribunal nor the Upper Tribunal has jurisdiction.

There is no valid appeal before either the First-tier Tribunal or the  Upper
Tribunal.
