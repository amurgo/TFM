                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                             DECISION ON REVIEW

1.   On 19 June 2017 I wrote to both parties as follows:

           "The Tribunal has received  an  application  for  permission  to
           appeal in this case.


           The Tribunal's decision was sent out on 29  March,  following  a
           hearing on 1 March 2017.  It now appears that a decision of  the
           Court of Appeal, UB v SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  Civ  85,  which  might
           clearly have an impact on the outcome of the present  case,  was
           delivered on 22 February 2017.  Neither  side  referred  to  it.
           This is particularly regrettable in view of the  duties  of  the
           Secretary of State re-emphasised in paragraphs 16-22 of UB.


           In the circumstances I propose to review  the  Upper  Tribunal's
           decision and set it aside following review under Rule  45(1)(a).
           Any submission to the contrary will be considered if made within
           14 days of the date of this letter."


   2. No response has been  received  from  the  Secretary  of  State.   The
      appellants' representatives have submitted further grounds, relying on
      UB but have not dissented from the proposed course of action.

   3. It is clear that the appeal needs to be considered on its facts in the
      light of UB.  No useful purpose would be served by involving the Court
      of Appeal in that process.

   4. I review the Upper Tribunal's decision and set it aside.   The  appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal is to be re-determined by  a  judge  other  than
      Judge Bruce.

                                  VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UPPER
                                  TRIBUNAL
