Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Makol, instructed by Maalik & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Kandola, Home Office Presenting Officer.

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellants are citizens of Pakistan and born on 18th December 1987,
    28th December 1987 and 17th December 2010 respectively.  They  made  an
    application on 23rd August for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as
    a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant and dependants under rule 245ZX  and
    319 of the Immigration Rules but the application  was  refused  on  2nd
    December 2013.  The respondent stated that  under  Appendix  C  of  the
    Immigration Rules the appellant was required to show he held �4,900 for
    a 28 day period ending on a date no earlier than 31 days prior  to  the
    application under paragraph 245ZX(d) of  the  Immigration  Rules.   The
    respondent stated that no evidence of funds had been provided.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Miles dismissed  the  appellant's  appeal  on
    18th June 2014 because the appellant had failed to show  the  requisite
    funds for the requisite period.

 3. An application for permission to appeal was made on the basis that  the
    Judge had misdirected himself  because  the  bank  statements  produced
    showed that the appellant held the requisite  funds  for  the  relevant
    period.   The judge had accepted that the appellant  submitted  a  bank
    statement which started on 19th February 2013 and ended  on  29th  July
    2013 and had been stamped on 19th August 2013.  The judge also accepted
    the letter from the bank confirming the balance as of 19th August 2013.
     The judge erred in  the  way  he  dealt  with  the  evidence  and  the
    consideration of the bank statement was completely incorrect  and  thus
    an error of law.

 4. Although the last date of the statement was 29th July 2013 the fact the
    statement was stamped 19th August 2013 by the bank  itself  showed  the
    balance of 29th July 2013 had not  changed  'all  the  way  until  19th
    August 2013'.  This, the representative claimed,  was  corroborated  by
    the bank letter of 19th  August  itself.   This  was,  the  appellant's
    representative claimed, how banks worked and the judge  had  failed  to
    realise this and it was a Robinson obvious point.  If  there  were  any
    change between the 29th July 2013 and 19th August this would have  been
    reflected in the statement, as the stamp shows the latest date  of  the
    statement.

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge  Saffer  of  the  First  Tier
    Tribunal.

 6. At the hearing Mr Makol  reiterated  his  grounds  of  application  and
    submitted that the judge should have inferred that the  funds  had  not
    altered by the stamp on the statement.  Mr Kandola submitted  that  the
    judge dealt the point of inference at paragraph 15 of the determination
    and rejected it.

 7. Mr Kandola confirmed that he had no original  documents  on  file.   No
    original documents for the specific period were produced.

Conclusions

 8. The Immigration Rules specify that the appellant must demonstrate  that
    funds are available for the 28 day period prior  to  the  date  of  the
    application (Appendix C).  The end date of the closing balance must  be
    dated no earlier than 31  days  before  the  date  of  the  application
    Appendix C 1A (h).  The appellant relied on his Lloyds Bank statements.
     The judge took the 28 day period as being to 29th  July  2013  because
    there was no bank statement, he concluded, after that date.

 9. Mr Makol stated that the relevant period was in fact 19th July 2013  to
    19th August 2013, a later period, which was relevant and that the judge
    had the documents before him  to  show  the  relevant  funds  for  this
    period. The judge had a statement stamped 19th August 2013 with entries
    ending on 29th July 2013.  From this Mr Makol concluded that the  judge
    should have inferred that the balance would have remained the same  and
    this was commonsense and obvious.

10. The judge specifically dealt with this point at [15] and stated

      'The appellant never explained why he submitted no bank statements  at
      that time to show the activity in the account between  29th  July  and
      19th August 2013 and it is simply not open to me to draw the inference
      that between those dates the balance was always in excess of �4,900'.

11. The judge might have been more expansive in his reasoning but the judge
    was correct to state that he could not draw an inference on the balance
    of funds.  Banks produce statements for  a  reason  and  a  date  stamp
    itself and alone cannot confirm that the balance had not  changed  from
    the last formal date given on the statement itself.  It is  clear  that
    the date stamp has been added later.  Indeed  on  the  file  of  papers
    produced was a statement with a stamp of 13th November 2013  which  was
    at the foot of a balance given on 27th  August  2013.  Page  2  of  the
    statement and separate form page 1 showed that by  13th  November  2013
    that balance had indeed changed.

12. At no point did the appellant produce a bank  statement  to  show  that
    funds were available during this period.  I could see what purported to
    be a copy showing a balance of  �21,500.15  on  12th  August  2013  but
    nothing for the period 29th July to 12th August.    The  appellant  did
    not produce a Lloyds statement to the respondent or to the  First  Tier
    Tribunal.  Nor did he produce an  original  even  of  the  document  he
    relied on and the judge noted this.  As stated  in  the  permission  to
    appeal, the bank date stamp on the statement is merely a stamp  by  the
    bank to confirm it is genuine and does not confirm and cannot  be  read
    as confirmation by the bank that the funds given on the last date  were
    in the account at the date of stamping.

13. The letter dated 19th August 2013 is confirmation by the bank that  the
    funds were in the account on  that  date,  not  before.   As  indicated
    above, the funds need to be in the account for  a  consecutive  28  day
    period. Indeed there was no original  evidence  even  of  the  document
    purporting to show that the funds were in the account between 29th July
    and 19th August 2013.

14. The appellant did not show that he held  the  funds  for  the  required
    period either on the period the judge used or the period  suggested  by
    Mr Makol. I note that the statement relied on to 29th July 2013 did not
    comply with the evidential requirements under Appendix C.

15. I therefore find that there was no material error of  law  which  would
    make a difference to the outcome and the determination shall stand.


Signed                                             Date 27th August 2014
