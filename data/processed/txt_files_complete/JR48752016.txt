                     Before Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara




Application for judicial review: substantive decision

Having considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  the  parties'
respective  representatives,  Mr  C  Mannan,  of  Counsel,   instructed   by
Westbrook Law, on behalf of the Applicant and, Mr L  Glenister  of  Counsel,
instructed by the Government Legal Department, on behalf of the  Respondent,
at a hearing at Field House, London on 6 March 2017.

Decision: the application for judicial review is refused

   Introduction


   1. These judicial review proceedings, issued  on  3  May  2016,  seek  to
      challenge the respondent's decision, dated 5 February 2016, to  refuse
      the applicant further leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) under
      the Points-Based System.

   Procedural history

   2. The  applicants  are  nationals  of  India.  The  principal  applicant
      (hereinafter referred to as the applicant) entered the United  Kingdom
      on 13 May 2008, with leave to  enter  as  a  student.  His  leave  was
      extended in the same capacity  until  16  February  2011  following  a
      successful appeal. Thereafter he was granted further leave  to  remain
      as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) until 8 January 2016. The applicant's  wife
      entered the United Kingdom as a Tier  1(Entrepreneur)  partner  on  17
      December 2013. His son was born on 2 April 2015.

   3. On 8 January 2016, the applicant sought further leave to remain  as  a
      Tier 1 (Entrepreneur). It is the refusal of this application which  is
      the subject of this challenge.

   4. The decision of 5 February 2016, informed the applicant  that  he  had
      been awarded only 20 out of the 75 points claimed for "Attributes" and
      accordingly he did not meet the requirements of paragraph 245DD(b)  of
      the Immigration Rules. The issues identified with the application were
      as follows.

   5. Firstly, in relation to category of the required investment made in  a
      United Kingdom business or businesses, it was said that the  applicant
      had not provided the specified documents  set  out  in  paragraph  46-
      SD(a)(iii) of Appendix A to  the  Immigration  Rules.  That  provision
      related to investment made in the  form  of  a  director's  loan.  The
      decision stated the following in this regard:

"As evidence of this you have provided business bank statements in the  name
of Amutha Traders UK Ltd, a Legal  Loan  Agreement,  unaudited  accounts,  a
letter  from  Accountants  CDOK's(UK)Ltd  which  state  you  have   invested
�200,000 into your business. Upon checking the business bank  statements  to
see what has been invested, we have only been able to  corroborate  �157,300
being paid into your business account. We have been  unable  to  accept  the
�157,300 as no evidence has been provided to confirm you were  the  Director
of the company when this money was invested."

   6. Secondly, no points were awarded under the category  showing  that  an
      applicant  is  engaged  in  business  activity  at  the  time  of  the
      application. It was stated that the evidence provided by the applicant
      to show that he had registered as self-employed and as the director of
      a new company in the United Kingdom did not meet the  requirements  of
      paragraph 46-SD(g) in the following respect:

"The most  recent  National  Insurance  direct  debit  shown  in  your  bank
statements is dated July 2015. This is more than  3  months  prior  to  your
application raised date. Therefore you have failed to demonstrate  that  you
are still registered as self-employed.

You have also failed to  provide  a  Companies  House  Current  Appointments
Report to demonstrate you are still registered as a Director."

   7. Thirdly, as to the category of job creation in the United Kingdom, the
      respondent noted that  the  applicant  claimed  to  have  created  the
      equivalent of two new full-time jobs for people settled in the  United
      Kingdom, each of which existed  for  at  least  12  months.  Regarding
      paragraph 46-SD(h)(i) the following was said:

"You have failed to provide the specified documents showing the start  dates
for the following employees, Vinothkumar Kandasamy, Joyce Kate  Ogola,  Gary
Robert Lucas, therefore the hours that these people have  worked  cannot  be
taken into consideration.

The hours calculated for the remaining employees S  Elangovan,  Joby  Jacobs
and S Muthusamy does not equate to 2 full time jobs. In addition,  you  have
failed  to  demonstrate   that   you   are   still   registered   as   self-
employed/director during the period you are claiming to have employed  these
individuals. We are also unable to take into  account  these  hours  due  to
this reason."

   8. The decision letter concluded by stating that paragraph 245AA  of  the
      Rules had been considered;  no  assessment  of  genuineness  had  been
      carried out as detailed in paragraph 245DD(k) of the Rules and no full
      verification checks had been carried out regarding the authenticity of
      the documents submitted.

   9. The applicant sought administrative review of the decision in issue on
      23 February 2016. In relation to the  first  issue  as  to  the  money
      invested, it was stated that total investment added up to �257,211.00.
      Reference was made to the purchase of stock of �59,911.00 as  well  as
      �40,00 spent on plant, machinery, furniture and fixtures and goodwill.
      There was said to be evidence  included  with  the  application  which
      provided evidence of that.

  10. As to the second issue of engagement in business, the applicant stated
      that his application mentioned that he was self-employed from 30 April
      2013 and from 13 May 2015 onwards he was a director of Amutha  Traders
      UK  Limited.  He  referred  to  documentation   submitted   with   the
      application showing  Class  2  National  Insurance  contributions.  He
      argued that NI was paid  at  the  time  self-assessment  returns  were
      submitted and that HMRC no longer issued bills.  The applicant  stated
      that he had provided evidence of his company directorship in the  form
      of a Companies' House report and a director's  loan  letter  was  also
      provided.

  11. Lastly, in relation to the jobs creation issue, it  was  said  in  the
      administrative review application that the respondent  had  overlooked
      the full payment  submissions  in  relation  to  the  three  employees
      mentioned in the decision, which mentioned the  start  date  of  their
      employment. It was further said that the  employee  pay  details  were
      provided which showed when the employees  began  working  with  Amutha
      Traders  UK  Limited.  It  was  contended  that  the  caseworker   had
      overlooked these documents.

  12. The negative response to the administrative review was dated 22  March
      2016 and maintained the original  decision  in  full.  The  respondent
      maintained that the business bank statements showed only an investment
      of �157,300 and this sum was not  accepted  because  no  evidence  was
      provided to confirm the applicant was the director of the company when
      the money was invested.  It was said that the evidence of directorship
      provided  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the   paragraph   46-
      SD(c)(i)(2). Mention was also made of the most recent proof of NI paid
      was July 2015 which failed to demonstrate that the applicant was still
      registered as self-employed as  well  as  his  failure  to  provide  a
      Companies House Current Appointment Report (hereinafter referred to as
      CAR) to demonstrate that he was still registered as  a  director.  The
      respondent  refuted  the  applicant's  contention  that  the  evidence
      relating to the three employees showed their start date.

  13. A pre-action protocol letter dated 19 April 2016  argued,  at  length,
      that the applicant had provided evidence showing that the  Rules  were
      met. In addition, reliance was placed on paragraph 245AA of the  Rules
      and the respondent's evidential flexibility policy.



  14. The grounds of this application addressed the three issues in turn.

  15. In relation to the investment issue, it was submitted in  the  grounds
      that the applicant had provided all required  documents  to  show  the
      investment of �157,300. It was further contended that  the  respondent
      was relying on a requirement which did not form part of paragraph  46-
      SD(a)(iii), in that the Rule introduced no requirement  to  prove  who
      was the  director  of  the  company.  Secondly,  in  relation  to  the
      employees, it was submitted that the information said  to  be  missing
      had  been  provided.  Thirdly,  reference  was  made   to   evidential
      flexibility under paragraph 245AA(d)(iii) in that it was said that the
      missing information was verifiable from other sources.

  16. The respondent's Summary Grounds of Defence was received  on  14  June
      2016, contested the entire claim and made the following points:

         . the applicant failed to demonstrate that  he  had  invested  not
           less than �200,000;

         . the applicant failed to provide evidence that he was a  director
           of the company at the time the directors' loan was taken out;

         . the Companies  House  print-out  was  not  before  the  original
           decision maker but submitted with the administrative review  and
           could not be considered owing to AR2.4 of  Appendix  AR  to  the
           Rules;

         . the Companies House document  was  insufficient  to  remedy  the
           original failure to provide specified documents;

         . evidence provided in relation to the three employees in the form
           of contracts of employment and a letter from an accountant  were
           not specified within paragraph 46-SD(h)(i);

         . evidence of the employees' start-date of 1 June 2015  failed  to
           demonstrate that the jobs existed for at least 12 months of  the
           period the applicant was previously granted leave as  a  Tier  1
           (Entrepreneur), as required by paragraph 50 of Appendix A

         . the applicant could not  benefit  from  paragraph  245AA(d)(iii)
           owing to his failure to submit specified documents;

         . it was not  accepted  that  the  application  should  have  been
           granted exceptionally under paragraph 245AA(d) as it failed in a
           number of respects

  17. Permission was refused on the papers by Upper Tribunal Judge Blum on 7
      July 2016.

  18. The renewed grounds amounted to a summary  of  the  original  grounds.
      Reliance was placed on Mandalia v SSHD [2015] UKSC 59 and the impugned
      decision was said to be incompatible with the applicant's rights under
      the ECHR.

  19. Permission was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Perkins  on  6  October
      2016, in a lengthy extempore judgment.  He  considered  it  reasonably
      arguable that the Secretary of State  was  wrong  to  state  that  the
      applicant was required to produce evidence that he  was  self-employed
      at the time of the  application,  simply  because  it  was  never  the
      applicant's  contention  that  this  was  the  case.  He  was  further
      satisfied that there was, arguably, sufficient information before  the
      respondent that more money had been invested  than  was  accepted  and
      that the flexibility policy needed to be invoked.  It  was  considered
      arguable that the applicant was not required  to  produce  a  CAR  and
      finally, he considered it arguable  that  the  evidential  flexibility
      Rule was invoked in relation to the evidence of the  employees'  start
      date.  Judge Perkins directed the applicant to prepare amended grounds
      and serve them on the respondent and  Upper  Tribunal  by  20  October
      2016.

  20. Amended grounds dated 31 October 2016 were received from the applicant
      which heavily resembled the original grounds, albeit with a  table  of
      investments to the applicant's business and  reference  to  additional
      documents.

  21. The respondent's detailed grounds of  defence  robustly  defended  the
      impugned decision for the reasons provided in the summary  grounds  of
      defence.

  22. A skeleton argument was filed on behalf of the applicants.  The  brief
      contents argued that  the  applicant  had  established  investment  of
      �200,000; that the provision relating to two full-time  employees  did
      not apply to the applicant owing to transitional provisions  and  that
      the applicant was now a director as opposed to self-employed.

  23. The respondent's skeleton argument, filed on 3 March 2017, essentially
      argued that the applicant failed to submit the CAR and  could  not  be
      assisted by paragraph 245AA; that he  failed  to  show  �200,000  cash
      investment and the documentation provided did not meet the criteria in
      the Rules for job creation.


   Submissions

  24. Mr Mannan began his submissions with the issue of the CAR. He disputed
      the respondent's claim in the impugned decision of  5  February  2016;
      that is that the applicant had provided no evidence to confirm that he
      was the director of the  company  when  the  money  was  invested.  He
      referred to the  content  of  the  applicant's  administrative  review
      application of 23 February 2016 where there was  a  reference  to  him
      being a director and having attached a document from  Companies  House
      dated 5 January 2016 at A106 of the bundle which sufficed in  that  it
      gave the date of appointment. Furthermore, Mr Mannan drew my attention
      to  the  documents  enclosed  with  the  administrative  review  which
      included a photocopy of an incorporation  certificate.   He  submitted
      that the provision of the CAR would have made no difference whatsoever
      to the evidence before the respondent. Page A106  showed  the  log  in
      date.

  25. Mr Mannan contended that the  reference  to  "BETA  This  is  a  trial
      service" on the Companies House material indicated that something  was
      going on at Companies House which meant that the document at A106  was
      all that could be generated.  Regarding the respondent's argument that
      she was not required to obtain evidence on the applicant's behalf,  Mr
      Mannan argued that it was free of charge to obtain  the  CAR  and  the
      respondent could have done so.


  26. Moving onto the issue of investment, Mr Mannan confirmed that  it  was
      the applicant's case  that  he  had  invested  over  �200,000  in  the
      business.  It was accepted by the respondent that  �157,300  could  be
      traced.  Regarding the remainder of the required money, Mr Mannan took
      me to A117-118, which were Lloyds Bank statements  dated  January  and
      February 2013 which  were  before  the  respondent  and  which  showed
      deposits of over �30,000 in January 2013 and �15,000 in February 2013.
      In addition, there was the unchallenged director's loan agreement from
      the applicant to his business of �200,000. Mr  Mannan  submitted  that
      the  sum  attributed  to  plant  machinery,  furniture,  fixtures  and
      goodwill in the accountant's report could be omitted and the applicant
      could  still  show  investment  of  �217,000.  Any  concerns  by   the
      respondent as to the amount of  the  investment  or  missing  evidence
      could have been addressed by exercising evidential flexibility.

  27. On the issue of the jobs said to  be  created  by  the  applicant,  Mr
      Mannan turned once more to the enclosures listed in the Administrative
      Review. That evidence included an RTI  summary,  wage  slips  and  the
      accountant's report at A132.  Mr Mannan relied on his account of Upper
      Tribunal Judge Perkins said in his decision on  permission,  that  is,
      that it was obvious that the date of the start of employment was  June
      2015.  In addition, all the employment contracts  were  dated  1  June
      2015 and this was sufficient to meet the requirements  of  the  Rules.
      Furthermore, the transitional arrangements in place  set  out  in  the
      Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Policy  Guidance  version  11/2015  stated  that
      there were different arrangements for  those  who  entered  the  route
      before 6 April 2014, in that such people may continue to employ, inter
      alia, 4 workers for 6 months each. The applicant was relying  on  that
      particular  arrangement,  therefore,  the  respondent  erred  in   her
      reliance on the incorrect Rule  and  the  documents  provided  by  the
      applicant answered her concerns.

  28. In reply, Mr Glenister emphasised that it was not  disputed  that  the
      applicant did not provide the CAR. The argument made on his behalf  by
      Mr Mannan, that the service was not available, was made for the  first
      time at the hearing. It had been submitted that  a  beta  service  was
      involved, but that was still the case as of 11 February 2017  when  Mr
      Glenister had attempted to obtain the CAR but had not been able to  do
      so as he was required to,  firstly,  create  an  account.  He  further
      commented that no specific part of paragraph 245AA of  the  Rules  was
      referred to during Mr Mannan's submissions. In any event, it  did  not
      apply because the specified document had not been submitted and it was
      not open to the applicant to submit something else and leave it to the
      Secretary of State to obtain the CAR.


  29. Mr Glenister took no issue with the applicant's description of himself
      as a director at the time of the application as opposed to being self-
      employed.

  30. Addressing the investment issue, Mr Glenister referred to Table  5  of
      Appendix A and emphasised that the �200,000 must be invested in  cash.
      There was no issue raised with the legal  agreement  relating  to  the
      director's loan at B119 showing the applicant will invest the said sum
      into Amutha  Traders.   Regarding  the  applicant's  reliance  at  the
      hearing on the statements from  Lloyds  Bank,  these  were  irrelevant
      because they dated from 2013 and from a time when  the  applicant  was
      self-employed. There was no mention of these bank  statements  in  the
      application,  the  accountants  report,  the   administrative   review
      application or the amended grounds. In any event, Mr Glenister  argued
      that the said  statements  showed  no  more  than  deposits  into  the
      business bank account used by the applicant when he was a sole trader.
      There was a lack of evidence to show that these sums were invested  by
      the applicant to  the  business  and  the  funds  were  withdrawn  the
      following month. Therefore, even if this evidence had been  presented,
      it would not have met the Rule. The loan agreement was between  Amutha
      Traders UK Ltd and the applicant, whereas the Lloyds  Bank  statements
      related to a different concern. The loan agreement dated 1  June  2015
      indicated the future tense, that is that the applicant will invest the
      money, whereas the Lloyds statements were dated 2013. The reference to
      stock and good will did not bring the  amount  of  the  investment  to
      �200,000 as only cash was relevant. Again, no provision of  evidential
      flexibility was referred to during Mr Mannan's submissions.

  31. Mr Glenister conceded that he  could  not  see  why  the  transitional
      arrangements would not apply to the applicant. Nonetheless, he  argued
      that even these provisions could not be satisfied. The  identities  of
      the four workers who had worked for the applicant  were  unclear.  The
      decision letter  had  focused  on  three  remaining  workers  and  the
      applicant's employment by his business did not count as his was not  a
      new job which had been created. Mr Mannan had  only  identified  three
      employment contracts during his submissions. Again, while  flexibility
      had been referred to, no sub-paragraph 245AA had been relied  upon  on
      the applicant's behalf.

  32. In closing, Mr Mannan listed the evidence provided  by  the  applicant
      with his application which was not disputed by the  respondent.  There
      was no need for the applicant to  rely  on  the  sums  in  the  Lloyds
      account. He reiterated that if the respondent was confused as  to  the
      evidence, further enquiries should have been made. Mr Mannan relied on
      paragraph 245AA(2)(iv); stating  that  the  respondent  could  request
      missing specified information, however his primary submission was that
      the evidence was clear. Regarding the CAR, Mr  Mannan  submitted  that
      this would not provide any additional information over and  above  the
      document provided by the applicant. He argued  that  the  document  at
      A106 was a specified document but for the fact that the words  current
      appointment record did not  appear  on  its  face.  He  submitted  the
      respondent could have asked  for  more  information  or  obtained  the
      report herself.

  33. On the issue of job creation, Mr Mannan conceded  there  were  only  3
      employees working for 6 months, but argued that they were working  the
      equivalent hours of 4 full-time jobs between them. He reminded me that
      the issue identified by the respondent was one of start date.

  34. Mr Glenister wished to add that while there was generally a  provision
      in the Rules  to  add  up  the  hours,  this  did  not  apply  to  the
      transitional arrangements.

  35. Mr Mannan concluded  by  saying  that  if  the  start  dates  for  the
      employees had been provided, the hours  would  have  been  taken  into
      consideration by the respondent. Any problems  could  be  resolved  by
      evidential flexibility.

   Discussion

  36. To succeed in an application for further leave to remain as a  Tier  1
      (Entrepreneur) the applicant is required to meet the  requirements  of
      paragraph 245DD(b) of the Rules; in that he "must have a minimum of 75
      points..." The applicant was awarded only  40  of  the  75  points  he
      claimed.



  37.  Following the hearing, three issues  remain  to  be  considered.  The
      first was whether the applicant provided the specified  evidence  that
      he was the director of Amutha  Traders  UK  Ltd  when  the  money  was
      invested in the business; secondly whether the applicant  invested  at
      least �200,000 in Amutha Traders UK Ltd and thirdly whether he met the
      transitional requirements of the Rules relating to  job  creation,  by
      providing the employees' start date.


  38. Paragraph 46-SD(g)(ii) of the Rules states as follows:


"if the Applicant is claiming points for being a director of a  UK  company,
he must provide a printout of a Current Appointment  Report  from  Companies
House ..."


  39. The applicant provided evidence that he was  the  director  of  Amutha
      Traders Ltd in the form of a page printed from Companies House website
      dated 5 January 2016. It is not in dispute that this document is not a
      CAR. The  amended  grounds  argue  that  if  the  respondent  was  not
      satisfied with  the  evidence  provided,  she  could  obtain  the  CAR
      herself. It was only at the hearing  that  it  was  suggested  on  the
      applicant's behalf that there might have been some difficulty with the
      applicant obtaining the CAR. At  the  same  time,  Mr  Glenister  gave
      evidence regarding his own attempts to obtain the CAR,  which  because
      an account must firstly be opened to do so.



  40. The applicant attempted in the amended grounds to  rely  on  paragraph
      245AA(d)(iii), in that he says  the  document  he  submitted  did  not
      contain all the specified information but the missing information  was
      verifiable from other documents and/or the  Companies  House  website.
      This argument was not developed by Mr Mannan.


  41. The said provision reads as follows:

       (d) If the applicant has submitted a specified document:
        (i) in the wrong format; or
        (ii) which is a copy and not an original document; or
        (iii) which does not contain all of the specified information, but
      the missing information is verifiable from:
        (1) other documents submitted with the application; or
        (2) the website of the organisation which issued the document; or
        (3) the website of the appropriate regulatory body;
the decision maker may request  the  correct  document  under  sub-paragraph
(b), or may  grant  the  application  despite  the  error  or  omission,  if
satisfied that the specified documents are genuine and the  applicant  meets
all the other requirements of the Rules.



  42. It is apparent from the  above  that  in  order  to  invoke  paragraph
      245AA(d)(iii) a specified document must  be  submitted  in  the  first
      instance, which simply did not happen on this occasion; that specified
      document being the CAR. Even if these flexibility provisions  applied,
      it is not reasonable to expect  the  respondent  to  search  Companies
      House website, create an account  and  place  an  order  to  obtain  a
      specified document on the applicant's behalf which the  Rules  require
      an  applicant  to  provide  with  the  application.   Therefore,   the
      respondent's decision to decline to exercise her  discretion,  by  not
      requesting the correct document from the applicant prior to making her
      decision was clearly reasonable and lawful.



  43. Turning to the issue of the investment. Table 5 of Appendix A requires
      the following:


"The applicant has invested, or had invested on his behalf,  not  less  than
�200,000...in cash directly into one or more businesses in the U.K."



  44. The "Legal Loan Agreement" between the applicant and Amutha Traders UK
      (LTD) dated 1 June 2015 indicates that the applicant "will  invest"  a
      minimum of �200,000 into the company from time to time which  will  be
      credited to the director's loan account. The applicant further  relies
      on an accountant's report which lists 11 transactions on various dates
      which together amount to �157,300. Those 11 transactions are supported
      by entries into the business bank statements of Amutha Traders UK  Ltd
      made between July and November  2015.  The  accountant's  report  also
      lists two other transactions; stating that �59,911 was spent on  stock
      and �40,000 is represented by "plant machinery,  furniture  &  fixture
      and goodwill." The applicant is relying on one or other of  those  two
      categories of expenditure to bring the total invested to the  �200,000
      mark.

  45. During  his  submissions,  Mr  Mannan  initially  suggested  that  the
      deposits totalling �47,320 made into the applicant's  Lloyds  business
      bank account in 2013, when he was a sole trader,  could  make  up  the
      deficit. However, this argument was not advanced in  the  original  or
      detailed grounds. Nor were the Lloyds Bank  statements  included  with
      the application. Even if they had been, it is unclear where the  funds
      emanated from and even if they amounted to a business  investment,  it
      was not an investment in Amutha Traders UK(LTD) but rather K Kandasamy
      T/A Reliance Local,  the  applicant's  previous  business.  Therefore,
      these bank statements do not assist the applicant.

  46. The difficulty  for  the  applicant  is  that  the  Rule  in  question
      stipulates that the investment must be made in cash directly into  the
      business in question. It is simply unarguable to portray  the  claimed
      investment in stock, plant machinery, furniture, fixtures and goodwill
      as cash investment by  the  applicant.  In  these  circumstances,  the
      respondent's conclusion that only  �157,300  of  investment  had  been
      shown was one that was reasonably open to her.

  47. In relation to the issue of job creation, it is common ground that the
      respondent erred in  not  considering  the  transitional  arrangements
      which apply  to  the  applicant.  The  applicant  ostensibly  benefits
      because he successfully applied to enter  the  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
      route prior to 6 April 2014. Notwithstanding that, the original  point
      made in the decision  remains,  whether  the  applicant  had  provided
      evidence to show the date upon which the employees started  work  with
      the applicant's business.

  48. The applicant provided contracts which state that the employees' start
      date was 1 June 2015, in relation to all the three employees mentioned
      in the refusal letter. Putting aside the  apparent  inability  of  the
      applicant to meet the  requirements  of  the  transitional  provisions
      regarding the number of employees, the reason given for  refusing  the
      points claimed for the job creation category  does  not  stand  up  to
      scrutiny.

  49. While the applicant has succeeded in the job creation  issue,  he  did
      not do so in  relation  to  the  issues  of  required  investment  and
      business activity. Consequently, in view  of  section  31(2A)  of  the
      Senior Courts  Act  1981,  had  the  respondent  not  made  the  error
      identified, it would have made no difference to  the  overall  outcome
      for the applicant and it  is  not  appropriate  to  grant  the  relief
      sought.

  50. Ultimately, the Secretary of State was clearly  entitled  to  conclude
      that the applicant had failed to meet the requirements of paragraph of
      245DD(b) and to refuse his application on that basis.

  51. This application is dismissed.








Order

I make  an  order,  therefore,  that  the  judicial  review  application  be
      dismissed.

A decision to the effect notified above will be formally made at  a  hearing
on a date to be fixed ("the adjourned hearing"),  and  the  judicial  review
application will thereupon be dismissed.   The  adjourned  hearing  will  be
"the hearing at which  the  decision  is  made"  for  the  purposes  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  ("the  Rules")  (see  the
Notification below).


In the meantime, the parties are to liaise and attempt  to  agree  an  order
consequential on such decision and dismissal. If they are unable  to  do  so
within 7 days after the date of receiving this Notice  they  must  within  7
days thereafter notify the Tribunal in writing of that fact,  and  file  and
serve in writing any applications and representations they may  have  as  to
costs and permission to appeal. Any such applications will be dealt with  at
the adjourned hearing.

In the absence of any application  the  Tribunal  will  of  its  own  motion
consider and decide the question of permission to appeal, pursuant  to  rule
44(4B) of the Rules.

 Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

 A party may appeal against such a decision to the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
question of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal  should  apply  to  the
Upper Tribunal for permission, at the  hearing  at  which  the  decision  is
given. If no application is made, the Tribunal must nonetheless consider  at
the hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule  44(4B)  of
the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3.
