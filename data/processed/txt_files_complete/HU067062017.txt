For the Appellant:     Ms A Jones, Counsel instructed by Chris & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

 1. The appellant in this case, was born on 2 July 1988 and is national  of
    Grenada.  The appellant appeals the respondent's decision dated 25  May
    2017 refusing the appellant further leave.  In a  decision  promulgated
    on 13 June 2018, Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hussain dismissed the
    appellant's appeal on human rights grounds.  The appellant appeals with
    permission on the basis that the judge refused to consider the  details
    of  the  appellant's  change  of  circumstances  in  the  form  of  her
    relationship with her British partner and the birth of her child as the
    Tribunal considered this to be a new matter under Section 85(5).

 2. The appellant and the respondent settled a judicial review  by  consent
    on 27 February 2017.  By way of a supplementary  bundle  lodged  on  21
    February 2017 the applicant had notified the respondent  that  she  was
    pregnant and it  was  upon  receipt  of  this  evidence  of  change  of
    circumstances that the respondent invited the applicant to  consent  to
    withdraw her JR application.

 3. Mr Jarvis accepted that the First-tier  Tribunal  materially  erred  in
    subsequently failing to  consider  the  appellant's  claim  to  have  a
    British partner and child as part of the Article 8 appeal.  It was also
    accepted by Mr Jarvis that the appellant  did  raise  the  relationship
    with a British partner and that she was pregnant  even  though  in  the
    respondent's refusal dated 25 May 2017, which  postdated  the  judicial
    review consent, there was no consideration of the  matter  despite  the
    respondent settling the judicial review in order to consider this.

 4. The "new matter" issue was therefore a red herring in that the evidence
    relating to the British citizen partner and  pregnancy  had  previously
    been raised  with  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  judicial  review
    proceedings and the Secretary of State had consented  to  reconsidering
    that claim.  Although therefore this new information was not considered
    by the decision maker in the Reasons for Refusal Letter  dated  25  May
    2017 as it ought to have been, it was not a new matter and  the  First-
    tier Tribunal ought to have considered this evidence in respect of  the
    partner and child and made appropriate findings.

 5. It was not disputed therefore  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal materially erred in law in failing to  consider  the  evidence
    before it of the appellant's relationship with a  British  citizen  and
    her British citizen child.

Remaking the Decision

 6. I was satisfied  that  the  decision  could  be  remade  by  the  Upper
    Tribunal.  The appellant's  representative  relied  on  the  bundle  of
    documents before the First-tier Tribunal in June 2018 which included an
    additional witness statement for the appellant, addressing the issue of
    her partner and son,  together  with  supporting  statements  from  her
    sister and her aunt.  There was, in addition, a witness statement  from
    the appellant's partner Mr A C (page 10 appellant's bundle).

 7. I heard oral evidence from the appellant and  from  her  partner.   The
    appellant's sister adopted her witness statement although there was  no
    cross-examination of the third witness.  At the end of  the  hearing  I
    reserved my decision on  the  remaking  of  the  appeal.   All  of  the
    evidence, together with the submissions of the parties is  set  out  in
    the Record of Proceedings.  In reaching my decision I  have  considered
    all of the information and evidence before me, even if not specifically
    mentioned below.

 8. It was not disputed that the appellant's case rests largely now on  her
    relationship with her partner and her British citizen child and to that
    extent the findings of the Tribunal in the decision promulgated in June
    2018 in relation to the appellant's private life at [21] and  following
    shall stand.  I note that there  was  no  findings  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal as to whether the appellant's relationship with her sister and
    her extended family in the UK could amount  to  family  life.   In  any
    event the appellant is no longer living with her sister and  is  living
    with her partner and the issue of family life with her sister  was  not
    actively  pursued  before  me.   I  am  not  satisfied  it   has   been
    demonstrated there is any family life with her sister  over  and  above
    normal family ties and therefore no family life with regards to Article
    8 in relation to her extended family (and again there was  no  specific
    argument made before me in relation to the relationship with her aunt).

 9. I heard evidence from both the appellant and her  partner.   Mr  Jarvis
    did not dispute the relationship and I  am  satisfied  that  it  is  as
    claimed.  It was Mr Jarvis' submission that  the  appellant  could  not
    qualify under Appendix FM and that  the  Secretary  of  State  was  not
    requiring the British citizen child to leave the UK and  therefore  the
    reasonableness provisions "did not apply."

10. Mr Jarvis conceded that there was no decision  from  the  Secretary  of
    State in respect of  the  appellant's  relationship  with  her  British
    citizen child and partner.  He apologised for that omission.

11. Mr Jarvis submitted that the application could not succeed as a parent.
     The appellant is a primary carer but living in the same house  as  her
    partner and could not therefore succeed under the parent route which is
    aimed at a situation where a relationship comes to an end.  In  respect
    of the partner route Mr Jarvis submitted that the appellant  could  not
    succeed  and  Mr  Jarvis  relied  on  S-LTR1.6   of   the   suitability
    requirements in terms of the appellant's  conduct  and  her  very  poor
    immigration history.  Even though he accepted she entered when she  was
    a child at 15 and could not be held responsible for her stay in the  UK
    between 2003 and 2006 she had nevertheless remained from  2006.   As  a
    consequence  of  S-LTR1.6  Mr  Jarvis  submitted  that  the   appellant
    therefore had no access to EX.1.   However, I take into  consideration,
    as  conceded  by  Ms  Jones,  that  the  appellant  cannot   meet   the
    requirements of the partner route, as she has been  in  a  relationship
    with her partner for less than two years.

12. Gen.1.2 provides as follows:

         'For the purposes of this Appendix 'partner' means-

          i) The applicant's spouse;

         ii) The applicant's civil partner;

        iii) The applicant's fiancï¿½(e) or proposed civil partner; or

         iv) A person who has been living together with the applicant in  a
             relationship akin to a marriage or  civil  partnership  or  at
             least two years prior to  the  date  of  applicant,  unless  a
             different  meaning  of  partner  applies  elsewhere  in   this
             Appendix

13. Ms Jones submitted that the starting point was Appendix FM  did  apply.
    She did not accept that the parent route did not apply as  the  parents
    were not separated.  Ms Jones although initially relying on  the  entry
    clearance provisions, then relied on E-LTRPT.2.2 and 2.3.   E-LTRPT.2.3
    provides as follows:

          a) The applicant must have sole parental responsibility  for  the
             child or the child normally lives with the applicant  and  not
             their other parent (who is a British citizen or settled in the
             UK), and the applicant must not be eligible to apply for leave
             to remain as a partner under this Appendix; or

          b) the parent or carer with whom the child normally lives must be
             -

               i) a British citizen in the UK or settled in the UK;

              ii) not the partner of the applicant (which  here  includes  a
                  person who has been in a relationship with  the  applicant
                  for less than two years prior to the date of application);
                  and

             iii) the applicant must not be eligible to apply for  leave  to
                  remain as a partner under this Appendix.

14. I reject Ms Jones interpretation of  E-LTRPT.2.3  as  applying  in  the
    appellant's circumstances which is clearly founded on a  misreading  of
    those provisions.  Although the appellant is  indeed  not  eligible  to
    apply for leave to remain as a partner, the appellant's  partner,  with
    whom she lives is a British  Citizen.   The  appellant  cannot  qualify
    under E-LTRPT.2.3.

15. I am satisfied that the  appellant  cannot  qualify  under  either  the
    partner or the parent provisions of Appendix  FM.   I  have  considered
    Gen.3.2 of Appendix FM which provides as follows:

         'Gen.3.2(1) Subject to sub-paragraph (4), where an application  for
         entry clearance or  leave  to  enter  or  remain  made  under  this
         Appendix, or an application for leave to remain which has otherwise
         been considered under this Appendix, does not  otherwise  meet  the
         requirements of this Appendix or Part 9 of the Rules, the decision-
         maker must consider whether the circumstances in sub-paragraph  (2)
         apply.

         (2) Where sub-paragraph (1) above applies, the decision-maker  must
         consider,  on  the  basis  of  the  information  provided  by   the
         applicant, whether there are exceptional circumstances which  would
         render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or  remain,  a
         breach of Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,
         because  such  refusal  would   result   in   unjustifiably   harsh
         consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child  or
         another family member whose Article 8 rights  it  is  evident  from
         that information would be affected by  a  decision  to  refuse  the
         application.'

16.  This  is  a  restatement  of  the  current  legal  position:  where  an
    application cannot meet the Immigration Rules, it  must  be  considered
    nonetheless whether the refusal would  result  in  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences (Agyarko and Ikuga v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UKSC 11).

17.   I  am  satisfied  that  there  are  circumstances,  whether  they   be
    considered exceptional or compelling  which  merit  a  grant  of  leave
    outside the immigration  rules.   In  reaching  this  finding,  I  have
    considered the best interests of the appellant's child.  The  child  is
    still an infant and it  was  not  disputed  that  it  is  in  his  best
    interests to remain in the UK with his  parents.   Mr  Jarvis  conceded
    that it was not reasonable to expect the British citizen child to leave
    the UK.  The importance of a child's British citizenship was emphasised
    in ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011] UKSC 4 as a  powerful  factor,  although
    not a trump card.

18.  I must take into  account,  when  considering  Article  8  outside  the
    Immigration Rules, section 117B  of  the  Nationality  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002, which provides as follows:

         'Article 8: public interest considerations applicable in all cases

               1) The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
                  the public interest.

               2) It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
                  interests of the economic well-being of the Unite Kingdom,
                  that persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United
                  Kingdom are able to speak English, because persons who can
                  speak English -

                   a) Are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

                   b) Are better able to integrate into society.

               3) It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
                  interest of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom,
                  that persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United
                  Kingdom are financially independent, because such person-

                   a) Are not a burden on taxpayers, and

                   b) Are better able to integrate into society.

               4) Little weight should be given to-

                   a) A private life, or

                   b) A relationship formed with a qualifying partner, that
                      is established by a person at a time when the  person
                      is in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

               5)  Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
                  established by a  person  at  a  time  when  the  person's
                  immigration status is precarious.

               6) In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
                  the public interest does not require the person's  removal
                  where-

                   a) The person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
                      relationship with a qualifying child, and

                   b) It would not be reasonable to  expect  the  child  to
                      leave the United Kingdom

19.  I am  satisfied  that  the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying  child.   I  rely  on  my  best
    interests' assessment, that the best interests of  that  child  lie  in
    remaining in the UK with both  parents.   I  must  go  on  to  consider
    whether it is reasonable to expect that child to leave the UK.

20.  It was Mr Jarvis' submission that such considerations did not apply  as
    the Secretary of State was not requiring the child to leave the UK.   I
    am not persuaded that such is the case.  Section  117B(6)  is  engaged,
    whether or not the child  will  leave  the  UK  in  practice.   I  must
    consider, as section 117B(6) does, whether the child should be expected
    to do so.  Such consideration encompasses not  only  a  best  interests
    assessment but a wider consideration of reasonableness  which  requires
    the best interests to be balanced against the impact on the  child  (MA
    (Pakistan) and others [2016] EWCA Civ 705 and AM (Pakistan) and  others
    [2017] EWCA Civ 180).  When resolved in an individual's favour such  an
    assessment is determinative of proportionality (paragraph 51 Rhuppiah v
    SSHD [2016] EWCS Civ 803).

21.  I take into account what was said in SF  and  others  (Guidance,  post-
    2014 Act) Albania [2017] UKUT  00120  (IAC)  that  in  essence,  absent
    criminal behaviour or a serious adverse immigration history, it is  the
    respondent's position that it would be disproportionate  to  remove  an
    applicant with a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with  a
    British citizen child.  The respondent's policy is a relevant factor to
    assist in the application of section 117B(6) (see  SF  and  others  and
    Hesham Ali v SSHD [2016] UKSC 60 (at 15 to 17 and 46)).

22.  Although  I  accept  that  the  respondent  can  and  does  update  his
    guidance, there was no evidence or submissions  before  me  to  suggest
    that  there  had  been  any  substantive  change  to  the  respondent's
    guidance, in altering the circumstances in which it is envisaged that a
    refusal to grant leave to a parent, where a British  citizen  child  is
    involved, is justified.

23.  I have considered that although the appellant  does  not  have  a  good
    immigration history, in not leaving the UK once she reached  adulthood,
    there was no element of  criminality  or  deception  and  I  take  into
    account that the appellant made attempts to regularise her  immigration
    status. I am not satisfied that it can be said to be a 'very poor' or a
    serious adverse immigration history.  Whilst the breaches committed  by
    the appellant weigh against her, they are not sufficiently  serious  or
    weighty, in my findings, to outweigh the best interests of her  British
    citizen child.

24.  I am satisfied that it is not  reasonable  to  expect  the  appellant's
    British citizen child to leave the UK  and  that  the  requirements  of
    section 117B (6) are met.  As a consequence, the public  interest  does
    not  require  the  removal  of  the  appellant,  which   would   be   a
    disproportionate and therefore unlawful interference with her Article 8
    rights.

Decision

25.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error  of  law  and
    is set aside.  I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
