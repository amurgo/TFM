                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mr Whitwell, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    dated 30 July 2014 dismissing an appeal against a decision  to  curtail
    the appellant's leave to remain in the United Kingdom dated 25  October
    2013 and a further decision to remove him from the United Kingdom.

2.   Mr Whitwell on behalf of the respondent referred us to  a  letter  from
    the Home Office dated 16 October 2014 in which it is  stated  that  the
    appellant voluntarily decided to leave the United Kingdom on  9  August
    2014 and therefore asked us to treat his appeal as abandoned in term of
    Section 104(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  We
    were informed that he had been removed to  Dubai  in  the  United  Arab
    Emirates having been refused leave to enter on attempting to do  so  on
    or about 20 September 2014.

3.   In the circumstances this appeal is treated as abandoned.





Signed                                  Date

Sitting as a Judge of the Upper Tribunal
