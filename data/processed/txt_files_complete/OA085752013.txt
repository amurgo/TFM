                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Phull promulgated on 30th April 2014, following a hearing at Birmingham
    on 22nd April 2014.  In the  determination,  the  judge  dismissed  the
    appeal of Mrs Manpreet Kaur  who  subsequently  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of India, who was born on 21st October  1984
    and she appeals against the refusal of entry clearance to enable her to
    join her British citizen husband, who is present and settled in the UK,
    namely, Mr Hardip Singh.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The  Appellant's  claim  is  that  she  enjoys  a  subsisting  marriage
    relationship with Mr Hardip Singh, and that they are in  regular  daily
    contact with each other.  She works as a doctor in India.  He works for
    Sandwell  Travel  Limited  in  West  Bromwich.   She  meets   all   the
    requirements of the Rules, including maintenance and accommodation, and
    the refusal letter was wrong in stating that the Appellant  had  failed
    to show that she could meet the maintenance requirements and  also  had
    failed to satisfy the Entry Clearance Officer that  the  couple  had  a
    subsisting relationship (see para 9 of the determination).

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge found that the marriage was indeed  genuine  and  subsisting.
    She heard evidence from Mr Hardip Singh, the sponsoring  husband.   She
    found "his explanation plausible that he calls daily  because  he  uses
    the family lyca mobile to speak to the Appellant .....   There  was  no
    real challenge to his evidence" (para 13).  The  judge  held  that  the
    marriage was subsisting and there was an  intention  to  live  together
    permanently (para 15).

 5. Where the Appellant did, however, fail to meet the Rules, was in  being
    able to show, according to the  judge,  compliance  with  the  relevant
    financial requirements, of �18,000 per annum "because there is a  clear
    lack of documentary evidence relating to the Sponsor's finances for the
    requisite period" (para 21).

 6. In relation to Article 8, the Appellant could not succeed  here  either
    because there simply was not the documentary evidence to  make  out  an
    arguable case (para 22).

Grounds of Application

 7. The Grounds of Appeal state that the judge erred as a matter of law  in
    deciding  that  the  Appellant   could   not   meet   the   maintenance
    requirements.

 8. On 13th June 2014, permission to appeal was granted.  It was said  that
    the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  should  have  applied  the   evidential
    flexibility criteria.  There also should have been a reasoned Article 8
    assessment and proportionality findings, which  stood  separately  from
    the findings under the Immigration Rules.  It was also said  that,  the
    judge decided the appeal under the Immigration Rules but failed to give
    due weight to the documentary  evidence  before  him  when  looking  at
    Article 8.

 9. On 1st July 2014, a Rule 24 response was entered.

The Hearing

10. At the hearing before me on 5th September 2014, Mr Samra submitted that
    there was a fundamental error  in  the  judge's  consideration  of  the
    facts.  The Appellant's case  had  never  been  that  his  income  went
    directly into his bank account.  The judge was  wrongly  searching  for
    evidence of his income in the bank statements.   The  Appellant's  case
    had always been that he was paid cash in hand  and  that  he  used  the
    money for clothing and his needs as  and  when  necessary.   The  judge
    records at paragraph 6 and at paragraph 19 that the salary is deposited
    in the bank account.  This is simply not true.

11. The Appellant's own bundle (at page 2, para 9, and at paragraphs 22 and
    23), makes it clear that the money is paid cash in hand.  At  paragraph
    23 he states "I am paid cash by my employer and utilise these monies as
    and when for my general expenses such as clothes  ..."  The  judge  was
    simply factually wrong to suggest that the money  went  into  the  bank
    account.

12. Second, the Immigration Directorate  Instructions  make  it  clear  (at
    9.3.6) that "self-employed income can be cash in hand  if  the  correct
    tax is paid" (see IDI dated December 2013).

13. Third, there was evidence that tax is indeed paid because this  appears
    in the letter in the bundle dated 25th June 2014, which shows that  the
    Appellant's income was �18,720 and he paid tax of 1,854 pence from HMRC
    itself.

14. Finally, if the Appellant did not meet the  Rules,  then  only  in  the
    alternative, would the Appellant suggest that regard should be given to
    the "exceptional requirements" and under this he should  succeed  under
    Article 8.

15. For his part, Mr Mills made two submissions.  First, that this  was  an
    out of country appeal and the letter that had been drawn  attention  to
    from the HMRC was dated 25th June 2014 when the  appeal  was  in  April
    2014 and the decision being challenged was dated 6th  March  2013.   To
    this, Mr Samra immediately replied that there was an earlier letter  in
    the bundle of 30th October 2012 (see page 34 of the  bundle)  and  this
    referred to the Appellant's six month's gross salary of �1,560, and  if
    one multiplied this by six then the figure  was  exactly  the  same  as
    �18,700, which is a figure given in the latest HMRC letter of 25th June
    2014.  The earlier letter of 30th October 2012  simply  referred  to  a
    figure of �10,444 but this was because  the  Appellant  had  only  been
    working for six months at this stage.   Mr  Mills  submitted  that  the
    second reason why this appeal could not succeed was because there  were
    no payslips to indicate what the gross income was.  To  this  Mr  Samra
    immediately replied that the payslips were  indeed  in  the  bundle  at
    pages 57 to 63 and these again showed an income of �1,560 in gross.  Mr
    Mills submitted that I should dismiss the appeal.



Error of Law

16. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    [2007]) such that I should set aside  this  decision  and  re-make  the
    decision.  The reason is quite simply the factual error by  the  judge,
    made at paragraphs 6 and 19 that the Appellant's salary  went  directly
    into his bank account.  It did not.

17. It was never the Appellant's case that this  was  so.   The  money  was
    given cash in hand.  He was entitled to be  so  paid  because  this  is
    clear from IDI at paragraph 9.3.6.  The only caveat  is  that  where  a
    person is paid cash in hand that person must make sure that  a  tax  is
    properly paid on the income and there have been consistent letters from
    the HMRC to confirm that tax is indeed paid (see page 34 for the letter
    dated 30th October 2012) and the latest letter of 25th June 2014.

18. This appeal only had to be decided on a balance of  probabilities,  and
    on that standard, it was clear that the Appellant  was  in  receipt  of
    income of �18,700.

Re-making the Decision

19. I have re-made the decision  on  the  basis  of  the  findings  of  the
    original judge, the evidence before her, and  the  submissions  that  I
    have heard today.  I am allowing this appeal for  the  reasons  that  I
    have set out above.  The Appellant clearly earns �18,700, and this  was
    evidenced by way of documentary proof before the judge.  It  was  never
    the Appellant's case that his money went into his bank account.

20. Proof of such earnings is not to be found in bank statements.  Proof of
    such  earnings  is  to  be  found  in  HMRC  letters  and  in  the  tax
    accountant's letters and in the payslips which appears at pages  57  to
    63.  Accordingly, the Appellant succeeds under  the  Rules.   Since  he
    succeeds under the Rules, he must succeed under Article 8 as well, were
    that to be in issue, which it is unnecessary for me to decide.

Decision

21. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I re-make the decision as follows.  This appeal is
    allowed.

22. No anonymity order is made.
