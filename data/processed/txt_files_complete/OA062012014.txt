                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge H Narayan, promulgated on 11th December 2014, following a hearing
    at Stoke-on-Trent on 1st December  2014.   In  the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of Mrs Harjit Kaur, whereupon  the  Respondent
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female citizen of India who was born on 31st  August
    1991.  She appealed against the decision of the Respondent refusing her
    application for entry clearance as the partner of a person present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom, in  a  determination  dated  17th  April
    2014.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that her sponsoring husband travelled to India
    and she and he first met on 14th April 2012,  during  which  time  they
    were formally introduced through their respective families with a  view
    to marriage.

 4. At the time her sponsoring husband, Mr Singh, spent some time with  the
    Appellant.  Both  couples  contemplated  marriage.   The  Sponsor  then
    returned to the UK due to his employment commitments  but  remained  in
    contact with the Appellant.  On 7th April 2013 the couple married in  a
    formal ceremony in accordance with their faith in  the  Punjab.   Their
    marriage was thereafter registered on 10th April 2013  in  India.   The
    Appellant provided an original English language certificate test having
    sat the IELTS  test  and  scored  5.0  band.   She  did  not  have  any
    convictions or unspent convictions.  Their  marriage  was  arranged  in
    accordance with their Sikh faith and they had met because they had been
    introduced by their respective families.  Each of the parties  intended
    to live together with each other as husband and  wife  on  a  permanent
    basis and indeed after the marriage on  7th  April  2012  they  resided
    together immediately at the matrimonial home.  There was also  adequate
    accommodation available for both parties  in  Wolverhampton  where  the
    sponsoring husband lived.  They would be able  to  maintain  themselves
    because the sponsoring husband, Mr Jasvir Singh Bains, was employed  on
    a full-time basis as an IT hardware specialist  with  an  international
    corporation since 11th June 2012 and earned a basic salary  of  ï¿½30,000
    (see letter of application from the solicitors dated 10th March  2014).



The Judge's Findings

 5. The judge heard evidence from the sponsoring husband, Mr Bains, that he
    telephones his wife "every day together with texts and emails from time
    to time together with cards and items for  the  past  two  years"  (see
    paragraph 9).  He heard evidence that he had  not  been  to  visit  his
    wife, "as he didn't think it would take this long" (paragraph 9).   The
    judge also heard evidence that the  Sponsor  "works  full-time  and  he
    takes his holidays to take care of his  mother  when  she  ends  up  in
    hospital."  He stated he started he started supporting  his  wife  from
    the marriage.  He stated the Appellant would "live with him  for  life"
    (paragraph 9).

 6. The judge heard how the Sponsor gave on to give "detailed  evidence  of
    being the primary carer for his mother and his wife is not coming as  a
    primary carer for his mother."  He dealt with his job  and  his  father
    being elderly and forgetful and the Appellant saying she wants to  work
    (paragraph 10).

 7. However, in his findings of fact, the judge observed that the  evidence
    at the  time  of  the  application  was  limited  in  relation  to  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   He  held  that  the  Appellant
    could have visited his wife given that  he  had  a  well-paid  job  but
    eleven months had elapsed since he had last visited (see paragraph 16).
     The judge then went on to say that he would  find  in  favour  of  the
    Appellant

         "... only because of the  evidence  which  in  fact  postdates  the
         decision of the Respondent of 17th April 2014 that the parties have
         proved on the balance of  probabilities  that  this  is  a  genuine
         marriage and they intend to live together as spouses.  I find  that
         the volume of phone calls and content of the  text  messages  which
         are contained in the Appellant's bundle 1 and referred  to  by  Mrs
         Pamma does demonstrate devotion between the parties and the settled
         intention to live together as at the time those communications were
         made" (paragraph 19).

    The judge in fact went on to say that,

         "... if I had to decide to speak simply upon the evidence  stopping
         on 17th April 2014 I would have decided that the Appellant had  not
         proved upon the balance of probabilities that this  was  a  genuine
         marriage and the parties intended to live together for the  reasons
         set  out  in  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager's   review   and   the
         Respondent's decision ..." (paragraph 20).

Grounds of Application

 8. The grounds of application state that, in allowing the  appeal  on  the
    basis of postdecision evidence, the judge had erred in law because  the
    well-known authority of DR (Morocco) [2005] UKIAT 00038 only allows for
    postdecision evidence to be taken into account if it appertains to  the
    circumstances at the date of the decision, and in this  case  this  was
    not so.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted on 16th February  2015  on  the  basis
    that Judge  Narayan  may  well  have  misconstrued  the  import  of  DR
    (Morocco).

The Hearing

10. At the hearing before me  on  15th  January  2016,  the  Appellant  was
    represented by Mr M Mohzam,  a  solicitor,  and  the  Respondent  was
    represented by Mr David Mills, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.
     Mr Mills submitted that as it was the Home Office's  appeal  he  would
    begin first and explain why the judge had erred in  law.   The  refusal
    decision was dated 17th April 2014.  The decision was then reviewed  by
    the Entry Clearance Manager on 18th September 2014 and it  was  upheld.
    Thereafter, an appeal was lodged and it came before  Judge  Narayan  on
    1st December 2014.

11. Mr Mills explained that the authority, DR  (Morocco)  only  allows  for
    postdecision evidence to be taken account if there is a continuation of
    an earlier situation  that  is  subsequently  demonstrated  by  way  of
    further evidence.  He submitted  that,  "the  classic  example  is  the
    situation before us".  However, if one looks at  the  authority  in  DR
    (Morocco) it is clear from this (at paragraph 25) that in that case,

         "... there was an issue about whether at the time of the  decision,
         the couple intended to live together  as  man  and  wife.   In  the
         language of the statute, did the circumstances appertaining at  the
         date of the decision include that intention".

12. The judge went on to explain that,

         "... evidence  that  those  were  then  the  circumstances  can  be
         provided by subsequent actions which  casts  light  upon  what  the
         position then was.  This was not the same as evidence  which  shows
         that the position was subsequently changed and that there now is an
         intention  which  previously  was  lacking.    Evidence   about   a
         subsequent change  in  the  intension  is  clearly  excluded"  (see
         paragraph 25).

13. Mr Mills went on to explain that the  crucial  issue  was  whether  the
    Appellant at the date of the  decision  on  17th  April  2014  had  the
    intention, shared with her sponsoring husband, to live together as  man
    and wife.  There was no finding by the judge  on  this  crucial  issue.
    This was a question of fact to be determined by the judge.

14. Instead, what the judge does is to  refer  to  subsequent  postdecision
    evidence, which can only demonstrate a "intention"  at  a  later  time,
    namely, the time when  the  judge  himself  heard  the  appeal  on  1st
    December 2014.  DR (Morocco) plainly excludes such a  scenario  because
    it is expressly said in paragraph 25 that, "evidence about a subsequent
    change in intention is clearly excluded".

15. For his part, Mr Mohzam submitted that this was simply  not  the  case.
    If one looks at paragraph 25 of DR (Morocco) it is plain that it allows
    for evidence as to what the circumstances  were  at  the  time  of  the
    decision.  This is exactly what the judge also had looked at.   Indeed,
    the Entry Clearance Manager had accepted  the  existence  of  evidence.
    The judge observed that, "he noted that  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager
    accepted there were phone calls between the two  parties  but  disputed
    the relationship as there were no documents ..." (paragraph  13).   The
    judge himself observed that having looked at bundle 1 the documentation
    was such that it

         "... clearly shows the parties have been in touch by text from 2013
         to date and by phone calls from November 2013 to date and that  the
         Sponsor  has  paid  in  2014  for  the  Appellant's  courses"  (see
         paragraph 18).

16. Finally, having looked at the evidence at the time of the decision  and
    the evidence subsequent to the decision, the judge  then  concludes  in
    his final paragraph that,

         "... because of the totality of the evidence since 17th April  2014
         that the Appellant has proved on the balance of probabilities as at
         date of decision that they have entered into a genuine marriage and
         that the  relationship  is  subsisting  and  they  intend  to  live
         together as each other's spouse".

17. The reference to 17th April 2014 is, of course, the date when  the  ECO
    made the decision.  The judge's finding here was that on the  "totality
    of the evidence" and applying the balance of probabilities  test,  then
    "at the date of  the  decision"  the  parties  had  entered  a  genuine
    marriage and it was  a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage  where  they
    intended to live together.

18.  Mr Mohzam submitted that this  paragraph  (at  paragraph  21)  plainly
    showed that on a balance of probabilities the  judge  had  allowed  the
    appeal by looking at the evidence in the round.

19. In reply, Mr Mills insisted that DR (Morocco)  had  not  been  properly
    applied.   The  phone  calls  were  largely  missing  and  only   arose
    postdecision.  Moreover, there were adverse credibility  findings  made
    by the judge against the Sponsor.  In these  circumstances,  the  judge
    ought not to have allowed the appeal.

No Error of Law

20. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  did  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCA 2007) such that I should set aside  the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.  First, this is not by any  means
    a situation of "a subsequent change in intention", which  DR  (Morocco)
    explains  "is  clearly  excluded"  (paragraph  25).   This  is   indeed
    precisely the kind of case to which DR (Morocco) does apply.  It  is  a
    case where there were  already  in  existence  precisely  the  kind  of
    evidence and indicators that demonstrated that the marriage was genuine
    and subsisting and that the parties intended to live  together  as  man
    and wife.

21. The only difficulty, if  it  was  such  a  difficulty,  was  that  this
    evidence was not to the degree to which the judge expected  it  to  be.
    Another judge may  well  have  disagreed  with  this  judge's  view  in
    relation to this, and may well have said that  the  level  of  evidence
    that was provided in this case was enough because it indicated that the
    parties were in touch.

22. Be that as it may, however, what is clear, nevertheless, is  that  even
    at the date of the decision, the Entry Clearance Manager  had  accepted
    that, "there were phone calls between the two parties"  (see  paragraph
    13).  The judge himself had accepted that the evidence

         "... clearly shows the parties have been in  touch  by  text  since
         2013 to date and by phone calls from November 2013.   As  is  well-
         known, in the present day  and  age,  hardly  anybody  writes  long
         letters  of  affection  by  way  of   the   traditional   form   of
         correspondence.  Communication for the most part is either by  text
         message  or  by  telephone  calls,  given  that   almost   everyone
         everywhere has access to a mobile telephone."

23. What is clear, in any event, is that from 2013  onwards  there  existed
    evidence both of phone calls and of text messages and this was found to
    be the case by the judge.  Second, it is this very  evidence  that  the
    judge then finds to be  in  existence  yet  again  when  he  makes  his
    findings in relation to postdecision evidence.  The only difference  is
    that there is now rather more copious demonstration of such evidence.

24. This is clear from his finding (paragraph 19) that,

         "I find that the volume of phone calls and the content of the  text
         messages which are  contained  in  the  Appellant's  bundle  1  and
         referred to by Mrs Pamma  does  demonstrate  devotion  between  the
         parties and a settled intention to live together ..."

25. Why the same level of devotion between the parties could not have  been
    demonstrated by the text messages which were in evidence from 2013  and
    phone calls from November 2013 is difficult to decipher.  Another judge
    may well have taken the view that, on a balance of probabilities, where
    the parties had married each other in an arranged marriage  as  is  the
    custom in that part of the world and with the  Sponsor  in  this  case,
    that the case was made out by the Appellant.

26. Whether or not this is the case is unnecessary to determine.   What  is
    necessary to show is that the judge, having looked at the  postdecision
    evidence, in a manner plainly allowed for by DR (Morocco), came to  the
    conclusion that taking the evidence in its entirety and as a whole,  he
    was satisfied that on the

         "... totality of evidence since 17th April 2014 that the  Appellant
         has proved on the balance  of  probabilities  as  at  the  date  of
         decision that they have entered into a  genuine  marriage  and  the
         relationship is subsisting and they intend to live together as each
         other's spouse"  (see paragraph 21).

27. In short, this is precisely  the  case  where,  DR  (Morocco)  operates
    because at paragraph 25 the Tribunal made it clear that, "evidence that
    those were then the circumstances can be provided by subsequent actions
    which cast light upon what the position then was".

28. It is clear that these were indeed the circumstances back  in  2013  as
    they are indeed the circumstances now, which the evidence was  designed
    to help cast light upon, in the same way  that  previous  evidence  had
    done in relation to the situation as  at  the  date  of  the  decision.
    There simply is no error of law in this case.  The decision must stand.
