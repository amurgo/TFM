Representation:
For the Appellant: Mr R Skyner, instructed by Middlesex Law Chambers
For the Respondent: Mr Shilliday, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant, a national of Pakistan,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
       Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State to refuse her
       application for entry clearance to join her husband,  Khalid  Mahmood
       (the sponsor), in the UK. The Entry Clearance Officer  (ECO)  refused
       the application under EC-P 1.1 (d) - Section E-ECP of Appendix FM  of
       the  Immigration  Rules.  These  provisions   cover   the   financial
       requirements applicable in an application for entry  clearance  as  a
       partner  under  Appendix  FM.  First-tier  Tribunal   Judge   Hussain
       dismissed the appeal and the appellant now appeals with permission to
       this Tribunal.

    2. The basis of the application was that the sponsor is self-employed in
       the UK and that in the previous full financial year he  had  a  gross
       income (before tax) of �18,810 per annum. It is not in dispute hat he
       needed to demonstrate that his income for  the  relevant  period  was
       more than �18,600.  The  ECO  refused  the  application  because  the
       appellant had not provided all of the documents specified in Appendix
       FM-SE to demonstrate his self-employment. The  ECO  listed  the  nine
       sets of documents required and  identified  that  the  appellant  had
       failed to produce five of them.

    3. The sponsor submitted  a  number  of  the  absent  documents  at  the
       hearing. The Judge found that four of the  five  omissions  had  been
       made good by those documents. The Judge found that  the  sponsor  had
       failed to provide a full set of bank  statements  covering  the  same
       period as the tax returns. The Judge also found  that  the  appellant
       had not demonstrated that the sponsor had  an  annual  income  of  at
       least  �18,600  because,  although  the  accounts  prepared  by   the
       sponsor's accountant showed a net profit  of  �18,810  for  the  year
       ending 31 March 2012, the actual income declared to HMRC was a lesser
       figure of �16,330. In the absence of objective evidence the Judge did
       not accept counsel's submission that the taxable income was less than
       the actual income because of his capital allowance of �2480.

    4.  The grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal contend that  the  Judge
       erred procedurally in not taking the sponsor's oral evidence  on  the
       issue of the capital allowance. It  is  further  contended  that  the
       Judge erred in not making a finding that the net profit was  �18,810.
       The grounds of appeal contend in the alternative that the Judge erred
       in failing to have regard to the decision in MM & Others v  Secretary
       of State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  1900  (Admin)  which
       proposed that  the  correct  minimum  income  requirement  should  be
       �13,400 per annum.

    5. In granting permission to appeal First-tier Tribunal Judge  De  Haney
       decided that the first ground is misconceived as Judge Hussain  noted
       in the  determination  that  both  representatives  agreed  that  the
       sponsor's oral evidence would not make any difference to the  outcome
       of the appeal. However  he  considered  that  the  second  ground  is
       arguable in that the Judge took  account  of  the  sponsor's  taxable
       income rather than his gross income.

    6. Of course the  decision  of  the  High  Court  in  MM  &  Others  was
       overturned by the Court of Appeal in MM (Lebanon) & Ors,  R  (on  the
       application of)v Secretary of State for the  Home  Department  [2014]
       EWCA Civ 985. In these circumstances there is no merit in  the  final
       alternative ground of appeal.

    7. The issue is therefore whether the Judge erred in  his  consideration
       of the sponsor's income.

    8. Mr Skyner submitted that E-ECP 3.1 provides that the  appellant  must
       demonstrate that there is a 'specified  gross  annual  income  of  at
       least...' (in this case) �18,600. Mr  Shilliday  submitted  that  the
       Judge was entitled to reach the conclusion he did on the basis of the
       evidence before him  as  he  is  not  an  accountant.  However  I  am
       satisfied that the wording of E-ECP 3.1 is clear, it refers to  gross
       annual income and this must mean the ordinary meaning of  the  phrase
       which is the annual sum  earned  before  tax  and  deductions.  I  am
       therefore satisfied that the Judge erred in considering  the  taxable
       income as the gross annual income.

    9. However I must also determine whether this was a material  error.  In
       this appeal the Judge was also not satisfied that the  appellant  had
       provided the specified bank statements. Appendix FM-SE  requires  the
       submission of business bank statements for the same 12  month  period
       as the tax returns. In his determination  the  Judge  said  that  the
       sponsor had submitted bank statements covering  the  period  from  12
       September 2011 to 5 February 2013. The Judge found that these did not
       meet the requirements as statements should have  covered  the  period
       from 5 April 2011 until 4 April 2012. Mr Skyner submitted that he was
       instructed that the correct bank statements  were  submitted  at  the
       hearing.

   10.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge's  determination  states  that  the
       appellant's bundle submitted  in  advance  of  the  hearing  had  not
       reached the Tribunal on time and that he  proceeded  without  it  and
       admitted further documents which the sponsor brought to the  hearing.
       The bundle, which arrived after the hearing,  does  not  include  any
       bank statements despite the index stating that they are included.  Mr
       Skyner submitted that he was instructed that this bundle did  include
       the relevant statements. He did not explain how the  statements  were
       not in the bundle despite being referred to in the index.

   11. There is on file a bundle of Business Current Account Bank statements
       issued by Barclays Bank covering the period from  12  September  2011
       until 5 February 2013.  Mr  Skyner  submitted  that  these  were  the
       statements submitted by  the  sponsor  at  the  hearing.  These  were
       clearly the bank statements relied on by the Judge.

   12. Two of those bank statements were also submitted with the  notice  of
       appeal covering the period from 7  September  2012  until  7  January
       2013. There are no other bank statements in the  file.  There  is  no
       explanation why the relevant bank statements were not  submitted  and
       no evidence to support Mr Skyner's submission that they were in  fact
       submitted.

   13. In these circumstances I accept Mr Shilliday's  submission  that  the
       lack of the relevant bank statements is fatal  to  this  appeal.  The
       Judge did err in relation to the gross annual income but  the  appeal
       was bound to be dismissed in any event because the appellant did  not
       provide  the   specified   business   bank   statements.   In   these
       circumstances I am satisfied that the Judge made no material error of
       law.







Conclusion:

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of a material error on point of law.
