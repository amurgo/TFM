                            DECISION AND REASONS


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or Court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

The Appellants

 1. The Appellants are mother and child,  born  respectively  in  1981  and
    2004. They are both citizens of Pakistan. On 29 March 2007 they entered
    as visitors. They overstayed and within 10 days of expiry of the  visit
    Visa the mother made and asylum claim which was refused on  2  November
    2007 and the appeal dismissed on 19 December 2007.

 2. On 12 August 2009 the mother's husband issued a deed of  divorce  which
    states  that  it  will  be  sent  for  registration  with   the   state
    authorities. is no  evidence  that  it  was  so  registered.  In  these
    circumstances, it is evidence that the child's parents  are  separated,
    even if not formally divorced.

 3. But on 18 June 2014 the mother made a  further  application  for  leave
    outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of her  private  and  family
    life in the United Kingdom. This was refused with no in  country  right
    of appeal. The mother lodged an application for judicial  review  which
    was dismissed at the hearing on 19 April 2016. On 6 May 2016  she  made
    further applications for herself and her child based on  Article  8  of
    the European Convention which was rejected and renewed on 16 June 2016.

The SSHD's decision

 4. On 31 August 2016 the Respondent refused the application for  both  the
    mother and her child.

 5. The mother did not meet any of the time critical criteria of  paragraph
    276 ADE(1) of the Immigration Rules and the SSHD  considered  that  she
    and her child on return to Pakistan could  re-integrate  without  undue
    hardship. Section EX1 of Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules  did  not
    apply, notwithstanding the child had been in  the  United  Kingdom  for
    over seven years because it was reasonable for the child to return with
    the mother to Pakistan. The SSHD went on to find  that  there  were  no
    exceptional or compassionate circumstances warranting a grant of  leave
    to remain.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 6. On 07 September 2016 the Appellants  lodged  notice  of  appeal.  By  a
    decision promulgated on 07  September  2017  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Watson dismissed the appeals on  all  grounds,  finding  there
    were no very significant obstacles to the integration of the Appellants
    on return to Pakistan and having considered the best interests  of  the
    child concluded it was not unreasonable for the child to accompany  the
    mother.

 7. The Appellant's sought permission to appeal and on 22 February  2018  a
    Designated Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  refused  permission  to
    appeal.

The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

 8. The permission application was renewed to the Upper Tribunal and on  13
    July 2018 Judge of the Upper Tribunal Storey granted permission because
    it was arguable the Judge had erred by failing to  apply  the  approach
    set out in R (MA (Pakistan))  v SSHD [2016] EWCA Civ.705 in respect  of
    children resident in the United Kingdom for over seven years.

 9. Subsequent to the grant of permission  to  appeal,  judgment  has  been
    given in in KO and Others v SSHD [2018] UKSC 53 and the Upper  Tribunal
    has  considered  the  meaning  and  impact  of  that  judgment   in   a
    Presidential decision in JG  (s  117B(6):  "reasonable  to  leave"  UK)
    Turkey [2019] UKUT 00072 (IAC) 27.

10.  The Appellants attended the hearing. I explained  the  purpose  of  and
    procedure to be followed at an Error of  Law  hearing.  They  confirmed
    their new address but otherwise took no active part in the proceedings.

11.  I noted the two cases referred to in paragraph 9  above  and  that  the
    child is now 15 and had arrived in the United Kingdom  in  March  2007,
    some  12  years  ago.  Mr  Tarlow  quite  properly  conceded  that  the
    Respondent could not oppose the Appellants' claim that the decision  of
    Judge Watson could not stand. Further, in the light  of  the  time  the
    child has been living in the United Kingdom and the  stage  reached  in
    her education, in the light of the recent case law the Respondent could
    not advance any argument that it would be reasonable for the  child  to
    have to leave the United Kingdom with the mother.

12.  I announced that I found the decision of Judge Watson in the  light  of
    the two cases at the turn of 2018/2019 contained an error  of  law  and
    should be set aside. I also announced the appeals would be allowed  for
    reasons to follow.

13.  There was no dispute as to the relevant facts which  can  be  extracted
    from the list of  documents  referred  to  in  paragraph  20  of  Judge
    Watson's decision and the oral testimony summarised at paragraphs 21-23
    and findings of fact in relation to the child appellant  at  paragraphs
    24 and 25 and the mother at paragraphs 26-28.

14.  At the date of the application leading to the  decision  under  appeal,
    the' child Appellant was over the age of  seven  and  had  never  lived
    elsewhere than in the United Kingdom since coming here at  the  age  of
    about 3 ï¿½ years. She is now aged 15 and will be her  GCSE  examinations
    in a matter of weeks.

15.  The child Appellant is a qualifying child by reference to  Section  EX1
    of Appendix FM to the  Immigration  Rules  and  s.117D(1)  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 as amended (the 2002 Act). Section  EX1
    requires that the best interests as  a  primary  consideration  of  the
    child must be taken into account  in  assessing  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the United  Kingdom.  The  SSHD
    gave as a reason for refusing the lead Appellant leave to  remain  that
    she had a very poor immigration history which was not challenged

16.  At paragraphs 17-19 of KO and Others in giving  the  only  judgment  of
    the Supreme Court Lord Carnwarth found: -

         "As has been seen, section 117B(6) incorporated  the  substance  of
         the rule without material change, but this time in the  context  of
         the right of the parent to  remain.  I  would  infer  that  it  was
         intended to have the same effect. The question  again  is  what  is
         "reasonable" for the child. As Elias LJ said in MA (Pakistan) Upper
         Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum  Chamber)  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  705,
         [2016] 1 WLR 5093, para 36, there is nothing in the  subsection  to
         import a reference to the conduct of the parent. Section 117B  sets
         out a number of factors relating to those seeking leave to enter or
         remain, but criminality is not one of them. Subsection  117B(6)  is
         on its face free-standing, the only qualification  being  that  the
         person relying on it is not liable  to  deportation.  The  list  of
         relevant factors set out in the IDI guidance (para 10 above)  seems
         to me wholly appropriate and  sound  in  law,  in  the  context  of
         section 117B(6) as of paragraph 276ADE(1)(iv).

         On the other hand, as the IDI guidance acknowledges, it seems to me
         inevitably relevant in both contexts to consider where the parents,
         apart from the relevant provision, are expected  to  be,  since  it
         will normally be reasonable for the child to be with them. To  that
         extent the record of the parents may become indirectly material, if
         it leads to their ceasing to have  a  right  to  remain  here,  and
         having to leave. It is only if, even on that hypothesis,  it  would
         not be reasonable for the child to leave  that  the  provision  may
         give the parents a right to remain. The point was well-expressed by
         Lord Boyd in SA (Bangladesh) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department 2017 SLT 1245, [2017] Scot CS CSOH_117:

             "22. In my opinion before one  embarks  on  an  assessment  of
             whether it is reasonable to expect the child to leave  the  UK
             one has to address the  question,  'Why  would  the  child  be
             expected to leave the United Kingdom?' In a case such as  this
             there can only be one answer: 'because  the  parents  have  no
             right to remain in the UK'. To approach the  question  in  any
             other way strips away the context in which the  assessment  of
             reasonableness is being made ..."

         He noted (para 21) that Lewison LJ had  made  a  similar  point  in
         considering the "best interests" of  children  in  the  context  of
         section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009  in
         EV (Philippines) v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
         [2014] EWCA Civ 874, para 58:

             "58. In my judgment, therefore, the  assessment  of  the  best
             interests of the children must be made on the basis  that  the
             facts are as they are in the real world. If one parent has  no
             right to remain, but  the  other  parent  does,  that  is  the
             background against  which  the  assessment  is  conducted.  If
             neither parent has the right  to  remain,  then  that  is  the
             background against which the assessment is conducted. Thus the
             ultimate question will be: is  it  reasonable  to  expect  the
             child to follow the parent with no  right  to  remain  to  the
             country of origin?""

17.  At paragraph 27 of JG (s 117B(6):  "reasonable  to  leave"  UK)  Turkey
    [2019] UKUT 00072 (IAC) 27 an Upper Tribunal Presidential panel found:-

         "We do not consider that paragraphs  18  and  19  of  KO  (Nigeria)
         mandate or even lend support to  the  respondent's  interpretation.
         In those paragraphs, the point being made by Lord Carnwath  and  by
         the judges in the cases he cited is  merely  that,  in  determining
         whether it would be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom, one must have regard to the fact that one  or  both
         of the child's parents will no longer be  in  the  United  Kingdom,
         because they  will  have  been  removed  by  the  respondent  under
         immigration powers.  That, we find, is  the  extent  of  the  "real
         world" envisaged by Lord Carnwath."

18.  After a consideration of the jurisprudence in KO  and  Others  and  the
    guidance given at various times by the SSHD  to  its  caseworkers,  the
    Upper Tribunal concluded at paragraph 39 that s.117B(6)  when  properly
    construed could result in "a person with  parental  responsibility  who
    could not invoke s.117B(6) may, nevertheless, succeed in a human rights
    appeal. At paragraph 41 the Upper Tribunal stated:-

         "We accept that this interpretation may result in  an  underserving
         individual or family remaining in the United Kingdom.  However, the
         fact that Parliament has mandated  such  an  outcome  merely  means
         that, in such cases, Parliament has decided  to  be  more  generous
         than is strictly required by the Human Rights Act 1998.  It can  be
         regarded as a necessary consequence of the aim of Part 5A  (of  the
         2002 Act) of imposing greater  consistency  in  decision-making  in
         this area by courts and tribunals.  The fact that  section  117B(6)
         has such an aim was expressly recognised by Elias LJ  at  paragraph
         44 of MA (Pakistan)."

19.  However, the child Appellant meets the time and formal requirements  of
    paragraph 276 ADE(1)(iv)  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and  hence  also
    s.117B(6) of the 2002 Act: see paragraph 7 of the judgment  in  KO  and
    Others. The remaining issue then is whether it is reasonable to  expect
    the child Appellant to leave the United Kingdom with the mother.

20.  The standard of proof is the civil standard; that is on the balance  of
    probabilities. The burden is on the Appellants. Evidence subsequent  to
    the date of decision may be taken into account.  The  relevant  law  in
    relation to claims based on the State's duty  to  respect  private  and
    family life is as at the date of  the  hearing:  see  paragraph  40  of
    Haleemudeen v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ. 558.

21.  Looking at the findings made by Judge Watson I am  satisfied  that  the
    best interests of the child are to remain in the  United  Kingdom.  The
    question is whether there are factors weighing against those  interests
    such that it would not be unreasonable to expect the child to  relocate
    with the mother who has an unsatisfactory immigration history.

22.  The mother has overstayed. She does not speak  English  and  has  lived
    with her family until some time in 2016 since when she has been reliant
    on public funds. The mother has family in Pakistan. Her mother died  in
    October 2016 but her  father  remains  in  Pakistan.  Her  evidence  is
    inconsistent  whether  she  remains  in  contact  with  her  family  in
    Pakistan. She has previously been found to be an unreliable witness. If
    she were the sole Appellant, I would find in all the circumstances  and
    having regard to the need to maintain proper immigration  control  that
    it would be reasonable for her to return to Pakistan.

23.  The child Appellant came as a toddler  and  will  have  little  if  any
    recollection of life in Pakistan. The child is well settled  in  school
    and has by now at the age of 15 developed a substantive private life of
    her own. She is described by both her school and mosque as settled  and
    doing well. The school states she has a  close  friendship  group.  The
    letter from the child Appellant at pages 15-17 the  Appellant's  bundle
    speaks with some passion of her involvement in school life and  of  her
    private life revolving around school and her school friends.

24.  The child Appellant has  in  effect  known  no  other  place  or  wider
    community in its life other than the United Kingdom. She  is  about  to
    sit her GCSE examinations. In these circumstances, as at  the  date  of
    the hearing I do not find it reasonable to expect the  child  Appellant
    to follow the mother to Pakistan. Therefore, the child Appellant  meets
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

25.  Consequently, even  assuming  the  child  Appellant  remains  with  the
    mother outside the United Kingdom it would be disproportionate  to  any
    legitimate  public  objective,  such  as  the  maintenance  of   proper
    immigration control, to require the child Appellant to leave the United
    Kingdom. Alternatively put, the public interest does  not  require  the
    child Appellant's removal from the United Kingdom. Hence the removal of
    the mother would also not be proportionate in terms of Article 8 of the
    European Convention: see paragraph 96 of JG.

26.  The appeals of the Appellants  are  allowed  on  human  rights  grounds
    (Article 8).

Anonymity

27.  An anonymity direction was made by the First-tier Tribunal. The  second
    Appellant is a teenage child and although no submissions were  made  on
    the point at the hearing, I consider it  appropriate  to  continue  the
    anonymity direction.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and to
    the limited extent referred to is set aside.

    The substantive appeal of each of the Appellants is allowed.

    Anonymity direction continued.
