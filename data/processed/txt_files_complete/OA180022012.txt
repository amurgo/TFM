Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr F Ansari of Richard Nelson LLP
For the Respondent:    Mr I Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan born on 18 January 1947.  On  12
    March 2012, she applied for entry  clearance  under  para  317  of  the
    Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) to settle in the UK with her son,
    Mr Shanah Umeed who is a British citizen.  On 28 August 2012, the Entry
    Clearance Officer refused the appellant's application.

 2. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  It was accepted  by
    the Respondent that the only live issue before the  judge  was  whether
    the appellant could show that she was  "financially  wholly  or  mainly
    dependent" on her son in the UK as  required  by  para  317(iii).   The
    respondent accepted that the appellant met the  remaining  requirements
    of para 317.  Judge Cresswell heard oral evidence from the sponsor  and
    his wife  and  considered  a  number  of  documents  submitted  on  the
    appellant's behalf.  He accepted the evidence of the  sponsor  and  his
    wife as giving "a wholly  truthful  account"  (see  para  15(ii)).   He
    accepted that the evidence was that the  appellant  had  a  pension  of
    �168.93 per month.  He accepted that she lived in the  family  home  of
    which she owned a one eighth share since her husband's death.  She paid
    no rent.  The evidence was, and as I say the judge accepted this,  that
    the appellant spent between �45 and �51 on food per week  and,  because
    of her health, she spent between �60 and �70 per  month  on  medicines.
    The judge accepted the evidence that the  appellant  on  average  spent
    �155.62 per month on utility bills.  There was, however, no evidence as
    to how much she spent on clothing. Adding those figures up,  the  total
    spending per month would, therefore, come to something in the order  of
    �400.

 3. At para 15(vi) the judge made the crucial finding in relation  to  para
    317(iii) as follows:

         "The  Appellant's  total  monthly  outlay,  therefore,   on   food,
         electricity, gas, telephone and medicine is some �300 (say �180 for
         food, �155.62 for utilities and �65 for medicine).  Added  to  that
         will be some clothing  expenditure.   Even  being  as  generous  as
         allowing in the figures given by the witnesses for which there  was
         no supporting evidence (i.e. food and medicine) and their estimates
         of the average utility bills, the Appellant  herself  provides  the
         monies from her pension for well over half of her costs."

 4. As a consequence, the judge found that the appellant was not "wholly or
    mainly" financially dependent on the sponsor and dismissed the appeal.

 5. The appellant sought permission  to  appeal  on  a  number  of  grounds
    including that the judge had made a simple arithmetical error  in  para
    15(vi) of his determination.  The appellant's monthly  outlay  was  not
    "some �300" but rather was some  "�400"  when  the  figures  for  food,
    utilities and medicine were added together.   Consequently,  since  the
    appellant's pension was  only  �168.93  she  was  "mainly"  financially
    dependent on her son to make up the shortfall to �400.  On 9  September
    2012, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge W L Grant) granted  the  appellant
    permission to appeal.  Thus, the appeal came before me.

 6. Mr Ansari began his submissions by relying on his skeleton argument and
    the obvious arithmetic error that had been made by the  judge  in  para
    15(vi).  He submitted  that  if  the  judge  had  done  the  arithmetic
    correctly he would probably have found that the appellant was  "mainly"
    financially dependent on her son and therefore met the  requirement  in
    para 317(iii).

 7. At this point, I enquired of Mr  Richards  who  represented  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer, what was his position  in  relation  to  this  error
    which seemed, to me, to  be  readily  apparent.   Mr  Richards  frankly
    accepted that  he  was  in  difficulties  in  maintaining  the  judge's
    decision.  He accepted that the judge had made an arithmetic error  and
    that the correct figure for the appellant's  outgoings  per  month  was
    some �400.  He acknowledged that on the judge's finding  the  appellant
    was receiving the balance of some �400 beyond her  monthly  pension  of
    �168.93 from the sponsor.  Mr Richards  did  not  seek  to  uphold  the
    judge's decision that the appellant had not established  that  she  met
    the requirements in para 317(iii).

 8. I accept Mr Ansari's submission that the judge made a  factual  mistake
    amounting to an error of law in para 15(vi).  The  correct  figure  for
    the appellant's total monthly outlay on food,  utilities  and  medicine
    should have been "some �400".  The judge accepted the evidence  of  the
    sponsor and his wife as being "wholly truthful".   The  judge  accepted
    that the appellant's  pension  per  month  was  �168.93  and  that  the
    shortfall for her  monthly  outgoings  was  provided  by  the  sponsor.
    Consequently, the appellant was financially dependent upon her son  for
    more than half of her income.  She required at least �232 to  meet  her
    outgoings.  As a proportion of her financial needs, I am satisfied on a
    balance  of  probabilities  that  she  was,  as  a   result,   "mainly"
    financially dependent upon the sponsor and so met  the  requirement  in
    para 317(iii) of the Immigration Rules.

 9. It being accepted that the appellant met the remaining requirements  of
    para 317, I am  satisfied  on  a  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
    appellant met all the requirements of para 317 at the date of decision.

Decision

10. For these reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's decision  to  dismiss  the
    appellant's appeal under the Immigration Rules involved the  making  of
    an error of law.  That decision cannot stand and I set it aside.

11. I remake the decision allowing the appellant's appeal under para 317 of
    the Immigration Rules.

                                                 Judge of the Upper Tribunal


TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I make a fee award for the whole fee (if any) that has been paid or  may  be
payable.
