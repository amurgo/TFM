Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Z Chaudhri, McKenzie-Friend.
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a citizen of Sri Lanka who applied for leave to remain
    under Appendix FM. It  was  refused  and  she  appealed  and  following
    consideration of that appeal on papers, and in a  decision  promulgated
    on 25 April 2018 Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Anthony dismissed her
    appeal.

 2. The Appellant sought permission to appeal. It was initially refused but
    a renewed application  was  subsequently  made  and  granted  by  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Frances on 12 November 2018. Her reasons for so granting
    were: -

         "1.  The Appellant  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
         Tribunal Judge Anthony dismissing her appeal against the refusal of
         leave to remain on human rights grounds. The appeal was decided  on
         the papers at the Appellant's request.

         2.   The English language certificate was not before the Judge.  It
         was however submitted to the Tribunal before the decision was  made
         and promulgated. It is arguable that there has  been  a  procedural
         irregularity which arguably lead to an error of law.

         3.   Although the  Appellant  could  not  satisfy  the  Immigration
         Rules, having failed to submit an English language certificate with
         her application, it is arguable that she could satisfy the Rules at
         the date of the First-tier  Tribunal  decision  and  therefore  the
         refusal of leave was arguably disproportionate. Had the judge  been
         aware of the English language certificate, he may well have come to
         a different conclusion."

 3. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 4. At the hearing it was established that prior  to  promulgation  of  the
    Judge's decision a Trinity  College  London  exam  report  and  Trinity
    College London certificate had been  filed  with  the  Tribunal.  Those
    documents confirm the  Appellant  passing  the  examination  in  spoken
    English Grade 3.

 5. In the circumstances Mr Jarvis accepted that in  not  considering  them
    there was a procedural error within the Judge's decision  and  that  it
    should be set aside and that the appeal should be remade and allowed.

 6. That is an analysis that I share.

Notice of Decision

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

I set aside that decision.

I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to  make  a  full  fee
award.
