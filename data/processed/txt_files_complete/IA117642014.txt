                                     and

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                          NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL AND
                   REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL GIVING CONSENT

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh who appealed to the First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State of 25  February
    2014. The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appeals in a  determination
    promulgated on 20 November 2014. Upper Tribunal Judge Coker granted the
    appellant permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. By way of a letter  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  dated  15  May  2015  the
    appellant states that he wishes to withdraw his appeal.

 3. Consent of the Upper Tribunal is required for a party to  withdraw  its
    case. Having carefully considered the facts of this appeal as a  whole,
    and observing that the Secretary of  State  was  the  successful  party
    before the First-tier Tribunal, I give such consent to the appellant to
    withdraw his case.

 4. Accordingly with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules  2008,  this  appeal  is  recorded  as
    "Withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal". This  is  a  Notice
    pursuant to rule 17(5) to inform the parties that the appellant's  case
    is withdrawn.

 5. The effect of the appellant's  case  being  withdrawn  from  the  Upper
    Tribunal is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal  are  at  an
    end. There is no appeal before the Upper Tribunal  and  the  First-tier
    Tribunal's decision shall stand.



Signed        Date: 18 May 2015
