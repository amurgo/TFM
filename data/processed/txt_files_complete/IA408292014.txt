                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant

1.   The Appellant is a  national  of  Mauritius.  She  appealed  against  a
    decision of the Respondent dated 29th September 2014 to refuse to  vary
    leave to remain and to remove her by way of directions under Section 47
    of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.   Her  appeal  was
    allowed at first instance by First-tier Tribunal Judge Monro sitting at
    Hatton Cross on 6th May 2015. The Respondent appeals with leave against
    that decision. For the reasons which I set out below at  paragraphs  15
    and 16 I have set that decision aside and remade it. Thus although this
    matter came before me as an appeal by the Respondent, for the  sake  of
    convenience I will continue to refer to the parties as they were  known
    at first instance. With  the  Appellant  as  second  Appellant  in  the
    proceedings below was her son M and his appeal too  was  allowed  (case
    number IA/40652/2014). The Respondent also appealed that decision but M
    has since been granted British citizenship and the proceedings  in  his
    case therefore fall away as he is  no  longer  subject  to  immigration
    control.

2.   The Appellant's husband Mr  Jaufaraully  states  that  he  entered  the
    United Kingdom in February 2004.  On 9th  March  2004  he  applied  for
    limited leave to remain as a student which was granted and then further
    extended until 31st March 2007.  On 27th  January  2007  the  Appellant
    entered the United Kingdom and together the couple applied for  further
    leave to remain with the Appellant as the dependant upon her  husband's
    application.  This too was granted and extended until 30th April  2009.
    On 7th August 2008 M, was born in the United  Kingdom.   On  27th  July
    2009 Mr Jaufaraully was granted further leave to remain  as  a  student
    with the Appellant and M as his  dependants.   On  30th  May  2012  the
    Appellant applied for leave to remain under Article 8 of  the  European
    Convention on Human Rights (right to private  and  family  life),  this
    time naming Mr Jaufaraully and M as her dependants.  This  was  refused
    on 12th July 2013 as the Respondent considered it  was  reasonable  for
    all three to return to Mauritius as a family unit.  All three  appealed
    that decision and on 4th July 2014 an Immigration Judge found that  the
    decision to refuse was not in accordance  with  the  law  and  remained
    outstanding before the Respondent to take.  On 29th September 2014  the
    Respondent made a fresh decision to refuse to vary leave to  remain  in
    the United Kingdom and to remove all three members of the family.

3.   On 6th January 2015 Mr Jaufaraully  was  granted  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom and in  consequence  did  not  pursue  his
    appeal against the Respondent's decision any further as that  too  fell
    away.  The effect of granting Mr Jaufaraully indefinite leave to remain
    was that M became eligible to apply for British citizenship which would
    then mean that the only person  who  could  be  removed  would  be  the
    Appellant.

The Determination at First Instance

4.   On 14th January 2014 Mr and Mrs Jaufaraully had a second child, A.   By
    the time of the hearing they were able to  show  that  they  earned  in
    excess  of  ï¿½24,800  gross  annually  and  thus   met   the   financial
    requirements under Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules.   M  attended
    school and only spoke English.

5.   At paragraph 24  of  her  decision  the  Judge  gave  her  reasons  for
    allowing the two appeals (the Appellant and M) that were before her:

         "Removal of the mother [the Appellant] would fracture  her  family;
         her husband cannot be  required  to  leave  the  country;  her  two
         children are entitled to register  as  British  and  their  futures
         should not be placed in jeopardy  by  [the  Respondent's]  decision
         which has failed to address the immigration status  of  the  family
         members as a whole and defies logic.  I find that the right of  the
         [Respondent] to operate a firm,  fair  and  consistent  immigration
         policy  has  been  outweighed  in  this  case  by  the   particular
         circumstances of this family and there are compelling circumstances
         not sufficiently recognised under the Rules for granting  leave  to
         remain.  I find that the decisions are not proportionate."

The Onward Appeal

6.   The Respondent appealed against the  first  instance  decision  arguing
    that the Judge had erred at paragraph 13 of her determination when  she
    wrote that the Respondent had wrongly  made  her  decisions  under  the
    Immigration Rules in force  from  12th  July  2012.   As  the  family's
    applications were made on 30th May 2012 the Judge held that pursuant to
    the decision in Edgehill the July 2012 Rules were  not  the  applicable
    ones. The grounds pointed out that this was wrong, the Court of  Appeal
    had clarified the matter in the case of Singh [2015] EWCA Civ 74.  That
    case held that apart from a short  window  between  9th  July  and  6th
    September 2012 the Respondent was entitled to  take  into  account  the
    July 2012 Rules in deciding applications even if they were  made  prior
    to 9th July 2012.

7.   In the course of  her  determination  the  Judge  had  referred  to  Mr
    Jaufaraully as a British citizen.  This was incorrect  because  he  had
    only been  granted  indefinite  leave  to  remain.   This  mistake  had
    materially affected the outcome given what the First-tier Tribunal  had
    considered regarding the best interests  of  the  children.   Ground  3
    argued that even if the couple's two children were able to register  as
    British citizens that process had not yet happened. To base a  decision
    under Article 8 on a supposition that the children would become British
    citizens was speculative and premature.  Further although the Judge had
    found that the financial requirements were met she had made no findings
    on what evidence had been adduced to support that finding.   The  issue
    of the children's potential nationality had infected the assessment  of
    the reasonableness of  them  leaving  the  United  Kingdom  with  their
    mother, the Appellant.  The possibility of being registered as  British
    should not have played any part in the  consideration  of  the  appeal.
    Finally the Judge had failed to give adequate reasons for finding  that
    the Respondent's decision to remove was disproportionate.  The analysis
    was restricted to a solitary paragraph 24 and the Judge had  failed  to
    carry out any balancing exercise at all.

8.   The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Hollingworth on 20th August 2015.   In
    granting permission to the Respondent to appeal he wrote:

         "An arguable error of law  has  taken  place  in  relation  to  the
         Judge's  description  of  [Mr  Jaufaraully]  being  British.    The
         Respondent maintains this is simply wrong.   It  is  arguable  that
         this has affected the weight attached in applying  Section  55.   A
         further arguable error of law has taken place in  relation  to  the
         anticipation of registration [of the children] as British citizens.
          A further arguable error of law is disclosed in the context of the
         applicable Rules".

9.   The Appellant replied to the grant of permission by way of  a  response
    under Rule 24 arguing that the First-tier Tribunal's decision was fully
    reasoned and contained no material errors of law.   It  was  immaterial
    that the Judge had referred to Mr Jaufaraully  as  being  British,  the
    important point was that at the time of the hearing he was present  and
    settled in the United Kingdom.  The Judge was right to have  regard  to
    the entitlement of the children to be registered  as  British  citizens
    pursuant to Section 1(3) of the Nationality Act 1981 as at the date  of
    the hearing such applications had already been made on  behalf  of  the
    children. The Judge had implicitly considered the July  2012  Rules  in
    making her finding as to  the  income  level  the  Judge  had  in  mind
    Appendix FM and implicitly had considered the documentary  requirements
    in Appendix FM-SE.  As the children  had  made  an  application  to  be
    registered as British citizens at the date of hearing it was right  for
    the Judge to take that into account.  The Judge had observed  that  the
    Respondent's decision had failed to address the immigration  status  of
    the family members as a whole.

The Hearing Before Me

10.  In submissions Counsel for the Appellant indicated  that  the  children
    had now been granted British citizenship.  The complaint  made  in  the
    grounds of onward appeal that the Judge had wrongly applied the pre-9th
    July 2012 law lost its force  because  the  Judge  had  considered  the
    matter in the alternative. For example at paragraph 16 she referred  to
    Appendix FM and at paragraph 17 referred to the requirements of Section
    R-LTRP.1.1(a), (b) and (d) together  with  EX.1(a)  of  the  July  2012
    Rules.

11.  For the Respondent it was argued that  the  grounds  of  onward  appeal
    were factually correct when they pointed out the mistake  made  by  the
    Judge referring to Mr Jaufaraully as being British.  That was  relevant
    because it affected the ability of Mr Jaufaraully to relocate  back  to
    Mauritius.  The question of the children's status was in similar  vein.
    Even if the children were now British one still had to  consider  their
    best interests in a holistic assessment, see  EV  Philippines  and  the
    ability of the children to reintegrate into life in Mauritius.

12.  In conclusion Counsel for the Appellants argued that there had been  no
    challenge by the Respondent that Appendix FM and FM-SE were met at  the
    date of hearing, merely that the Judge had not referred to the evidence
    required by Appendix FM-SE.  In fact  there  was  very  clear  evidence
    before the Judge to which she referred in her  determination  including
    evidence of the income of the couple.  Whatever errors there  might  be
    in the determination could have made  no  material  difference  to  the
    outcome.  Referring on one occasion to Mr Jaufaraully as being  British
    was an error of composition not substance.  The Judge had also referred
    to Mr Jaufaraully as having indefinite  leave  to  remain  (correctly).
    Because of that status the children's applications  to  become  British
    citizens had  been  granted.   At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing  I
    indicated that I would allow the  Appellant's  appeal  and  would  give
    written reasons in due course which I now do.

Findings

13.  The family  composition  in  this  case  is  that  Mr  Jaufaraully  has
    indefinite leave to remain, the Appellant has Section 3C leave and  the
    couple's two children are both British citizens.  The only  person  who
    could be removed is the Appellant.  Her removal would leave  two  young
    British children without their mother or (if they went with her)  would
    deprive the two children of the benefits  of  their  recently  acquired
    status. It would negate the consequences  of  granting  Mr  Jaufaraully
    indefinite leave to remain as  the  family  would  have  to  return  to
    Mauritius.  If all four members of the family were  Mauritian  citizens
    and none had indefinite leave to remain there are arguably good grounds
    for finding  that  the  Judge's  assessment  of  proportionality  under
    Article 8 erred in law.  That however is not the position.

14.  In fact the present position is similar to the position as  it  was  at
    the hearing in May 2015 as the Judge understood it. In deciding on  the
    question of an error of law and if so on a disposition thereafter there
    are two issues in the case to be considered. The first is  whether  the
    Appellant can succeed under the Immigration Rules and the second is  if
    she  cannot  whether  she  should  be  able  to  succeed  outside   the
    Immigration Rules.  The Judge found that the  appeals  succeeded  under
    the Rules as  a  result  of  which  the  appeals  stopped  there.   The
    Appellant  was  said  to  have  met  the  requirements  of  Section  R-
    LTRP.1.1(a), (b) and (d) since under EX.1(a)  she  had  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with her  children  who  in  May  were
    eligible to be registered as British citizens and who now  are  British
    citizens.

15.  The Judge did not consider it reasonable  to  expect  the  children  to
    leave the United Kingdom.  Strictly speaking as the grounds  of  onward
    appeal point out  the  children  were  not  qualifying  children  under
    Section 117C Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 at  the  date
    of hearing but they are now.  The test of whether there is  a  material
    error of law in this case is  whether  the  Judge's  treatment  of  the
    children as being qualifying children was wrong in law.  I find that to
    be so although it is fair to point out that M is now a qualifying child
    on two grounds.  Firstly he is a British citizen and  secondly  he  has
    been in the United Kingdom for more than seven years, turning 7 on  7th
    August 2015.  However at the time of the hearing the children were  not
    qualifying children and it was an error of law to treat them as if they
    were.

16.  The effect of finding an error of law and setting  aside  the  decision
    of Judge Monro and proceeding to re-make the decision  is  nevertheless
    to arrive at the same conclusion that she reached.  Both  children  are
    now qualifying children and the position remains, as the  Judge  found,
    it is not reasonable to expect either or both  of  them  to  travel  to
    Mauritius.  That being the case, even if it  can  be  argued  that  the
    Judge "jumped the gun" the position now is that the Appellant does meet
    the Immigration Rules for the reasons given by Judge  Monro:  it  would
    not be reasonable to expect the children to leave  the  United  Kingdom
    and this brings the Appellant within the parameters of Section EX.1.

17.  There was no error in the Judge's treatment of  the  Immigration  Rules
    since although she was wrong to consider that Edgehill applied  outside
    the particular window between July and September 2012, she nevertheless
    went on to consider the July 2012 Rules in any event. As was  submitted
    there was no serious challenge to  the  evidence  which  supported  the
    claim to meet the financial criteria. Further it is not quite  accurate
    for the grounds of onward appeal to describe  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge referring to Mr Jaufaraully  as  being  British  "throughout  the
    determination".  In fact the Judge only referred to Mr  Jaufaraully  as
    being British on one occasion.  At  paragraph  7  she  referred  to  Mr
    Jaufaraully as being granted indefinite leave to remain,  at  paragraph
    12 in her consideration she referred to his grant of  indefinite  leave
    to remain and I accept that the one  reference  to  Mr  Jaufaraully  as
    being British was a slip of the pen and did  not  materially  interfere
    with the Judge's conclusions.

18.  The argument that the Judge failed to give adequate reasons as  to  why
    the family could succeed under Article 8 was  also  arguably  in  error
    because the Judge had found that  the  Appellant  succeeded  under  the
    Rules.  The Article 8 assessment would only  apply  if  she  could  not
    succeed under the Rules and the Article 8 assessment would then have to
    be carried out on the basis that due weight would have to be  given  to
    the fact that this was an appeal outside  the  Rules.   I  have  quoted
    paragraph 24 of the determination above and it is  plain  from  reading
    that paragraph that the Judge has not carried out  the  proportionality
    exercise based on the premise that the Appellant was unable to meet the
    Rules.  That error however is immaterial since I have  found  that  the
    Appellant (now) meets the Rules in any event.

19.  The only party to this onward  appeal  is  the  Appellant  since  as  a
    result of being granted British citizenship M ceases to be a  party  to
    the case just as his father Mr Jaufaraully had ceased  to  be  a  party
    before the first instance hearing.  At that date  neither  of  the  two
    children were qualifying children under Section 117D(1).  I accept that
    the Judge's treatment of  both  children  as  qualifying  children  may
    arguably be said to have  interfered  with  her  assessment  under  the
    reasonableness test of whether it was reasonable to expect the children
    to leave the United Kingdom.  However since  then  both  children  have
    become qualifying children,  M  on  both  bases.   When  applying  that
    factual matrix to the Appellant's appeal it becomes clear that she  can
    now satisfy the requirements of Section EX.1 even if she could  not  at
    first instance.  Her appeal thus falls to be allowed.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.  I have re-made the decision  by  allowing  the
appeal of the Appellant against the decision of the Respondent.

Appellant's appeal allowed.

I make no anonymity order as there is no public policy reason for so doing.

the making of an error of law, I set aside the fee awards made in this  case
such that no fee award is payable.
