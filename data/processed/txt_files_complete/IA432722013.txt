                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the  decision  of  Judge  Hillis
    made following a hearing at Bradford on 20th February 2014.

Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Bangladesh born on 5th January 1982.   He
    first entered the UK on 3rd September 2008 with  leave  valid  to  21st
    July 2010 following an allowed appeal for entry clearance as a  working
    holidaymaker.  He subsequently applied for leave to remain on the basis
    of enabling him to participate in access rights to his  child  and  was
    granted discretionary leave until 1st April 2013.  On 28th  March  2013
    he was granted a further three  month  period  of  discretionary  leave
    valid to 1st August 2013.

 3. The subsequent decision to refuse further leave was the decision before
    Judge Hillis, which he wrongly characterised as an application  refused
    under paragraph 322(1).  In fact it was refused under  Appendix  FM  of
    the Immigration Rules and Rule 276ADE with respect to private  life  in
    the UK.

 4. Ms Murshed accepted that the error was immaterial because the Appellant
    could not meet the requirements of the Rules in any event and the  sole
    issue was whether the judge erred in law in his assessment  of  whether
    there would be a breach of the Appellant's family life under Article  8
    outside the Immigration Rules.

 5. In January 2011 the Appellant contracted an  Islamic  marriage  to  Mrs
    Begum, and on 23rd November 2011 the couple's baby daughter  was  born.
    There is no issue that the marriage is not valid in English  law.   Mrs
    Begum was still at that time legally married to her first husband.

 6. It is not disputed that the relationship between the Appellant and  Mrs
    Begum subsequently broke down and they separated, hence the application
    for discretionary leave in order  to  exercise  access  rights  to  his
    daughter.

 7. The Appellant's application for access rights was initially refused but
    upon appeal, allowed on 27th June 2012 in order to enable the Appellant
    to participate in access proceedings regarding his daughter.  The judge
    on that occasion found that the marriage had broken down and  that  Mrs
    Begum had returned to  live  with  her  sister  in  London  with  their
    daughter.  She was persuaded on the evidence before her that,

      i) "There was no prospect of  reconciliation  although  the  Appellant
         said  he  had  tried  through   family   members   to   bring   the
         reconciliation about."

 8. Mrs Begum made an application for indefinite leave to remain in the  UK
    which had been refused on 16th September 2010 and at the  date  of  the
    hearing before the judge her leave to remain  was  about  to  run  out.
    However on 11th  April  2014  she  was  granted  a  further  period  of
    discretionary leave to remain.  The reason for the  grant  is  unclear.
    Mrs Pettersen said that the Home Office file stated that it was on  the
    basis of the present Appellant having become naturalised as  a  British
    citizen in 2011 but in any event, since the grant  of  leave  was  made
    after the judge's determination, it is not relevant  to  the  issue  of
    whether he erred in law.

 9. It was claimed before  Judge  Hillis  that  the  parties  had  in  fact
    reconciled and that the marriage was subsisting and  they  were  living
    together. The couple started to live together again  in  October  2013.
    The Appellant produced a  bundle  of  documents  which,  it  was  said,
    established that they were living at the same address,  including  bank
    statements, letters from HM Revenue & Customs, wage slips and  doctors'
    cards.

10. Judge Hillis said that he had read all the  documents  and  taken  them
    into account when reaching his decision.

11. He heard oral evidence from both the Appellant and from Mrs Begum.   He
    found that their evidence was discrepant, particularly in relation to a
    demand by Mrs Begum of a payment of �10,000 as a gift without which she
    would not reconcile with him.

12. The judge said it was clear from the evidence that both Mrs  Begum  and
    the Appellant understood that the other was in the UK legally and  that
    this was a significant  reason  for  their  agreement  to  marry.   The
    Appellant was under the impression that Mrs Begum had indefinite  leave
    to remain and not that her application for status had been refused.  He
    said that both parties were primarily concerned  with  the  immigration
    status of their prospective partner and he noted that  Mrs  Begum  said
    that she would not return to Bangladesh under any  circumstances  which
    in his judgment illustrated that there was no persuasive evidence of  a
    true reconciliation between the parties.

13. There was no persuasive evidence that it was in the best  interests  of
    the child to stay in the UK rather than to travel  back  to  Bangladesh
    (he erroneously stated Pakistan) because the child was still of an  age
    where she had no real knowledge of life in the UK and would be able  to
    adapt.

The Grounds of Application

14. The Appellant sought permission to appeal on the grounds that the judge
    had failed to take into account  relevant  evidence  on  the  issue  of
    whether the Appellant and Mrs Begum had genuinely  reconciled  and  had
    taken into account irrelevant matters.

15. It was unreasonable to take the previous determination as his  starting
    point because the previous judge was assessing the current state of the
    relationship on the evidence  but  was  in  no  position  to  determine
    whether there would be reconciliation in the future.  The  judge  ought
    to have approached the issue on the evidence before him.  It was  clear
    from a letter sent from Cadman Solicitors to Solace Women's  Aid  dated
    31st January 2013 that the couple wished to  reconcile.   There  was  a
    formal consent order in the Bradford County Court in  relation  to  the
    access proceedings which stated,

         "Upon the parties having reconciled so that  they  are  now  living
         together with the child M N,"

    and with numerous letters showing that the couple were  now  living  at
    the same address.  Instead  of  scrutinising  the  evidence  the  judge
    focused on reasons why the couple got married  and  inconsistencies  in
    their evidence, and their attitude to  their  immigration  status  when
    they got married was wholly irrelevant to the  issue  of  whether  they
    were now in a subsisting relationship.  This was an  arranged  marriage
    and the couple would not have known as much about each other as one who
    embarked on a relationship before marriage.  Furthermore the fact  that
    Mrs Begum was unwilling to return to Bangladesh did not mean  that  the
    reconciliation was not genuine.

16. Finally the judge did not take into account the best interests  of  the
    child.  Since October 2013 M N had been seeing her father  on  a  daily
    basis and there had been no real assessment on the impact on  her  were
    the Appellant to return to Bangladesh.

Submissions

17. Mrs Murshed relied on her grounds and submitted that the  determination
    was flawed for the reasons set out in them.

18. Mrs Pettersen defended the determination and said that  the  judge  had
    heard oral evidence from both witnesses.  He was clearly  unhappy  with
    much of that evidence and many of his findings had not been challenged.
     He was concerned with the nature of the reconciliation rather than the
    fact that the couple were living under the same roof and  was  entitled
    to decide that there was no family life between the couple.

Findings and Conclusions

19. The lack of  detailed  reference  to  the  documentation  renders  this
    determination vulnerable to appeal.  There was clear evidence in  those
    documents which showed that the couple were  cohabiting.   Nevertheless
    the judge stated that he had taken  the  documents  into  account  when
    reaching his decision and there is no basis for finding that he did not
    do so.

20. The issue before him was, in any event,  not  whether  the  couple  had
    recommenced cohabitation but whether the  reconciliation  was  genuine.
    In reaching the conclusion that it was not he was perfectly correct  to
    take as his starting point the view of the  previous  judge  which  was
    that there was no prospect  of  reconciliation.   Cleary  that  was  an
    assessment made at the time of that  hearing  and  matters  might  have
    changed, but it was his starting point.

21. The judge then did consider the evidence as to whether there  had  been
    such a change.  The motivation  behind  the  marriage  was  a  relevant
    matter for him.  It was clear to him that Mrs Begum understood that  he
    had a legal basis of stay in the UK when the marriage was arranged and,
    since she had expressed a strong desire not to  return  to  Bangladesh,
    the inference that the couple were attempting to use what they  thought
    was the other's immigration status to stay in the UK  was  relevant  to
    the question of whether the reconciliation was genuine.

22. Moreover the Appellant's  evidence  was  that  his  wife  had  demanded
    �10,000 as a gift  as  a  condition  of  reconciliation,  although  the
    reconciliation had in fact  taken  place  without  the  payment.   That
    evidence is supportive of the judge's  conclusion  that  there  was  no
    genuine reconciliation.

23. So far as the best interests of the child are concerned, she  would  be
    returning to the country of her nationality with her  parents  and  the
    judge was entitled to find that it would be in her best interests to do
    so.  No evidence to the contrary appears to have been put  before  him.
    At the date of the hearing the child's  mother's  leave  was  about  to
    expire.  Neither of the parents therefore had any basis to stay in  the
    UK.  In the circumstances there can be no error in  the  judge  finding
    that it was in the child's best interests  to  be  in  her  country  of
    nationality with her parents.

24. The decision is sustainable.

Decision

The judge did not err in law and his decision stands.
