For the Respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer



                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against the decision promulgated on 9  June  2016  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge E Grant which refused an appeal on asylum and
    human rights grounds.

 2. At the hearing before me,  the  parties  were  in  agreement  that  the
    grounds set out at paragraphs 2 and 3 had merit. The approach taken  by
    the First-tier Tribunal judge to the physical and  psychiatric  medical
    evidence, in particular at [93]-[95] was in error. The  FTTJ  erred  in
    the proper application of JL (medical reports-credibility) China [2013]
    UKUT 00145 (IAC) and KV (scarring - medical evidence) Sri Lanka  [2014]
    UKUT 00230 (IAC) and  in  failing  to  take  into  account  alternative
    evidence from the detention centre  Rule  35  report  as  well  as  the
    physical medical report.

 3. The parties were also in agreement that  these  errors  concerning  the
    medical evidence were undermined the  credibility  assessment  entirely
    because  of  the  holistic  nature   of   that   exercise.   In   those
    circumstances, the respondent consented to the decision being set aside
    and it was common ground that the re-making should take  place  in  the
    First-tier Tribunal in line with paragraph 7 of Part 3  of  the  Senior
    President's Practice Statement dated 25 September 2012

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error  on  a  point  of
law and is set aside.

The appeal will be re-made de novo in the First-tier Tribunal.
