No anonymity order requested or made

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The parties are as above, but this determination refers to  them  as
       they were in the First-tier Tribunal.


    2. The SSHD appeals against a  determination  by  Judge  R  G  Handley,
       promulgated on 15 January 2014,  allowing  the  appellant's  appeals
       "under the immigration Rules and Article 8".


    3. Mrs O'Brien acknowledged that  the  grounds  do  not  challenge  the
       finding that the third appellant fell  within  the  requirements  of
       paragraph 276 ADE of the Rules, as it stood at  the  relevant  time.
       She also advised us that on such a conclusion,  the  policy  of  the
       SSHD (set out in published instructions) is to  grant  leave  on  an
       Article 8 basis, outside the Rules, to other family members.

    4. Mr Gibb told us that the first appellant is anxious to travel abroad
       to visit her father, who is unwell.  In the  circumstances  we  gave
       our decision orally,  as  undernoted,  under  rule  40  (1)  of  the
       Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.  This  determination
       is the notice of our decision under rule 40 (2).


    5. The appeal of the SSHD to the  Upper  Tribunal  is  dismissed.   The
       determination of the First-tier Tribunal, allowing  the  appeals  of
       all four appellants, shall stand.
