Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Bustani - Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Walker - Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by Mariam Ayodele Ikpefuran,  a  citizen  of  Nigeria
    born 19th January 1969.   She  appeals  against  the  decision  of  the
    Respondent made on 7th February 2014 to refuse further leave to  remain
    in the United Kingdom on human rights grounds and to remove  her  under
    Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

 2. The Appellant's appeal against that decision was  heard  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Beach on 24th September 2014.  Judge Beach dismissed the
    appeal under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  on  human  rights  grounds.
    Permission to appeal was granted and  on  25th  February  2015,  having
    heard submissions, I found that there was a material error  of  law  in
    the determination of Judge Beach and I set that decision aside with  no
    preserved findings of fact.

 3. The Respondent had initially issued a decision to remove the  Appellant
    on 22nd July 2013 and did not grant the Appellant an  in-country  right
    of appeal.  The Appellant appealed and an Immigration Judge found  that
    the Respondent's decision was not in accordance with the law since  the
    Appellant should have been granted an in-country right of appeal.  As a
    result of  this  the  Appellant's  human  rights  application  remained
    outstanding before the Respondent who eventually made the decision that
    is the subject of this appeal.

 4. I have a statement from the Appellant in  which  she  states  that  she
    entered the  UK  on  25th  December  2003  and  has  been  living  here
    continuously since then.  She says that she was living  with  a  friend
    and they had made contact with her older sister Margaret Opeyemi Bello,
    a British citizen.  She moved in with her sister in 2004 for two  years
    and then in 2006 moved in with another friend  because  there  was  not
    enough space in her sister's apartment as she has four  children.   She
    would help her sister with the care of the children and taking them  to
    and from school.  She developed a very strong bond  with  the  children
    and still spends as much time with them as  possible  although  she  no
    longer lives there.  Their mother died in 2006.   Her  sister  is  very
    protective of her.  She visits her sister once or twice a week and they
    speak on the phone every day.  She has  a  partner,  Harrison  Olusegun
    Olubayo, whom she met in 2005.  The relationship became serious  around
    2009 and they started living together in December  2013.   Her  partner
    can support her  financially.   He  is  a  security  officer.   He  has
    children from a previous relationship and they  both  spend  time  with
    them.  She has studied during her time in the UK and was awarded an NVQ
    Level 2 in Health and Social Care  in  November  2006.   She  has  also
    completed training in Food Hygiene.  She cannot take up a  job  because
    of her immigration status.  She hopes to get a good job once her status
    is regularised.  She is  a  member  of  the  church.  There  are  three
    statements from the Appellant all in similar terms.

 5. I have a statement from Mr Olubayo who was born on 13th May  1958.   He
    works as a security officer and has a salary of in excess of �35,000  a
    year.  He says he has a genuine and  committed  relationship  with  the
    Appellant who is also close to his three children who are  all  settled
    in the UK.  They want to get married once  her  immigration  status  is
    regularised.  I have  confirmation  of  his  employment  and  his  bank
    statements.

 6. I have a further statement from him which  is  undated  but  which  was
    apparently prepared for the hearing in the  Upper  Tribunal.   He  said
    that he has been in the UK since August 1980  and  is  established  and
    settled here.  He does voluntary work in the local community.  He works
    full-time and has ample funds to take care of himself and  his  family.
    Leaving the UK to go and live with his fianc�e in a  different  country
    is not a feasible choice for him.  He has very little link to  Nigeria.
    All his family are in the UK.  He only visits Nigeria  for  remembrance
    ceremonies  of  his  deceased  parents.   He  said  that  he  sees  his
    relationship with the Appellant as the best thing that has happened  to
    him in a long time and he knows that it will affect  the  stability  of
    his life if she is separated from him.  He cannot relocate to Nigeria.

 7. There is a third statement from him dated 27th January 2014 in which he
    states that his family is very important to him  and  he  has  his  own
    network of friends.  He has no connections whatsoever to Nigeria.

 8. I have letters from the Appellant's  sister  Ms  Margaret  Bello.   The
    first is dated 1st November 2013 and says that her sister is  faithful,
    honest and hardworking and has been of great assistance to her.  I also
    have a letter from her which is undated  and  is  in  the  Respondent's
    bundle.  She states that she has known the  Appellant  "for  over  four
    years" and she has been supporting her financially and materially.

 9. I have other letters from friends and some from the church,  supporting
    the Appellant's appeal.

Evidence at the Hearing

10. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant who adopted her statement  and
    confirmed the training and education that she has done in the UK.

11. In cross-examination she confirmed in response to a  question  from  Mr
    Walker that she had made an application under  EEA  law  in  2008.   Mr
    Walker provided written confirmation of this application which appeared
    to indicate that the application had been made  along  with  two  other
    people for leave to remain as an  extended  family  member  of  an  EEA
    national exercising Treaty Rights in the  UK.   He  provided  a  letter
    dated 28th September 2009 from the  UK  Border  Agency  to  a  firm  of
    solicitors in Camberwell Road in London refusing the application.   The
    application was accompanied  by  a  letter  from  a  man  called  Daini
    confirming that  the  Appellant  and  the  other  two  people  are  his
    relatives and living with him as his dependants at an address in London
    SE20.  The names of the other two people named on this letter were  put
    to the Appellant.  She said that they are both her friends.  She denied
    that she had provided any birth certificates for  that  application  or
    that she had ever lived at the address in SE20.  She  denied  that  she
    had made the application saying that her  solicitor  had  done  it.   I
    asked her if she had paid the solicitor and she said that she had  not.
    She named one of the other two  people  named  on  the  application  as
    having paid the solicitor.  Mr Walker asked her if it is the case  that
    she agreed to take part in this application.  She  responded  that  she
    wanted the Home Office to know that she was here.  She wanted  official
    residence in the UK.

12. The Appellant said that she has never worked in the UK.  She was  asked
    whether, when she came here, she lived with her sister.  She respondent
    "For a while".  She was at  her  sister's  until  December  2013.   She
    confirmed her partner's employment.  He sometimes goes to  church  with
    her.  She said they decided to live together after his last child  left
    home to go to university.  There was not enough space for her prior  to
    that.  She was asked when her partner last visited Nigeria and said  it
    was about three years ago.  He went for his mother's funeral.

13. The Appellant was then asked some questions about where she  had  lived
    since coming to the UK.  She confirmed that her sister had always lived
    at the address given on her statement.  Mr Walker asked  the  Appellant
    if she knew an address in Albert Road, London.  She was  asked  if  she
    had lived there.  She responded that she had.  She  said  she  was  not
    there long - a couple of months.  She had moved  out  of  her  sister's
    flat.  When she was pressed for a date she said initially that  it  was
    2000 then said she could not remember.  When she was asked how long she
    had lived at Albert Road she said about two years.  When she was  asked
    who paid for that flat she said she does not know.   She  did  not  pay
    rent.  She was seeing her partner at that point.  Mr Walker  asked  her
    where she was when she was arrested by the Home Office.  She  said  she
    was at her aunt's.  Mr Walker pointed out  to  her  that  the  document
    confirming her arrest shows the address in Albert Road.  The  Appellant
    said that she had been at Albert Road for about two years prior to  her
    arrest.  She was supported  by  the  family  she  lived  with  at  that
    address.  That family have no relationship with the people mentioned on
    the EEA application.

14. In re-examination Ms Bustani put it to the Appellant that she had given
    conflicting dates.  She suggested that she could not have moved out  of
    her sister's house in 2000 because she did not  come  to  the  UK  till
    2003.  She had said in her statement that she  lived  with  her  sister
    between 2004 and 2006.  The Appellant confirmed that to  be  the  case.
    She said that in 2006 she moved to live with a friend then went back to
    her sister's.  Prior to moving in with her partner she lived  with  her
    sister.  She confirmed that the last time her partner went  to  Nigeria
    was before they moved in together.

15. I asked the Appellant how long she had lived at the address  in  Albert
    Road.  She did not answer the question other than to say she could  not
    remember but said that when she came out of detention she went  to  her
    aunt's then to her partner's house.  She was coming and  going  between
    the two.  I asked her where she was when she was detained and she  said
    she was at the address in Albert Road.

16. I  note  that  when  the  Appellant  completed  an  immigration  status
    questionnaire on 17th July 2013 she put down her  address  as  that  in
    Albert Road.  That address was also on a letter  of  authority  to  her
    solicitors dated 8th October 2013.

17. I then heard evidence from Mr Olubayo who adopted his statements.   His
    three children are aged 18, 20 and  22.  They  have  lived  with  their
    mother since she and their father separated but he saw them nearly  all
    the time before they all went off to Nottingham  University.   He  sees
    them when they are on vacation and as often as he  can  otherwise.   He
    has lived at the same address since 2002.  He last visited  Nigeria  in
    November 2014.  He was asked where the Appellant  was  living  when  he
    first met her and said she was living with her sister.  They  broke  up
    for a while and she then lived  at  Queen's  Park  (Albert  Road).   He
    thought it was around early 2009 that she started to live there because
    that was when they started to see each other again but he was unable to
    remember how long she had been there.  He first met her  sister  around
    2011 although they had spoken a couple of times prior to  that  on  the
    phone.  He does not belong to the same church because  he  is  Catholic
    but he has attended her church.  He was asked if he had visited her  at
    the address in Albert Road and said that he had.  It was a one  bedroom
    flat in a house.  He believed it  to  be  owned  by  a  friend  and  he
    understood that she paid no rent.  His house has only one bedroom.  The
    Appellant moved in when the last of his children went off to university
    in 2013.  He knew nothing about  the  Appellant's  immigration  history
    until around 2013.

18. In re-examination he said that the Appellant had moved into  his  house
    from the address in Albert Road.

19. I then heard evidence from the Appellant's sister Margaret Bello.   She
    adopted her statement.  She said she does not know why her letter  says
    that she has known her sister for four years because she is her  sister
    and she has known her all her life.

20. In cross-examination she confirmed that the Appellant  had  lived  with
    her from the start.  Mr Walker asked her if her sister had always lived
    with her and she responded that she had.  She said  she  moved  out  in
    2013.  He asked her if her sister had ever lived anywhere else and  she
    said that she is an adult and she would  sometimes  stay  over  with  a
    boyfriend.  Mr Walker asked Ms Bello if her sister had  ever  lived  at
    the flat at Albert Road.  She responded "She doesn't live  there.   She
    lived with me from 2003 to 2013".  She said the Appellant has a  family
    friend who lives there and gave the same name  as  that  given  by  the
    Appellant.  She said she does not know  why  the  Appellant  uses  that
    address.  She was unable to remember when she first met the Appellant's
    partner.  She appeared to know nothing about the  EEA  application  and
    had never heard of the people named thereon.   She  was  asked  if  her
    sister had ever tried to regularise her immigration status  here.   She
    responded that she had said something about it some years ago  but  she
    herself had no idea what her  sister  was  doing.   She  supported  the
    Appellant financially until 2013.  She said there is always food in the
    house and it does not cost much.  It was put to her that the  Appellant
    had said that she did not live with her sister but at  the  address  in
    Albert Road.  She responded that her sister's stuff was always  at  her
    house.

21. She said that when her sister was released from detention she  came  to
    live with her. When she was asked if it was not the case that  she  had
    gone to Albert Road she responded that she had not  gone  there.    She
    pointed out in re-examination that the Appellant had been arrested when
    she went to sign on.  She was not arrested at Albert Road.  She went to
    that address to help the woman who lived there  with  her  child.   She
    said that the Appellant's mail is not sent to her house.

22. In his submissions Mr Walker said he would rely on the refusal  letter.
    He said that conflicting evidence had been given at the  hearing  about
    addresses where the Appellant had lived.  The evidence of her  and  her
    sister was totally contradictory.  The evidence  of  when  her  partner
    last visited Nigeria was inconsistent.  He said that  there  is  little
    evidence of a relationship.  It has to be taken into account  that  she
    made a completely false EEA application in 2008.   The  genuineness  of
    the relationship is still not made out  and  the  conflicting  evidence
    given at the hearing goes  against  the  Appellant's  credibility.   He
    asked that the appeal  be  dismissed  on  the  grounds  that  there  is
    inadequate evidence of a genuine and subsisting relationship.

23. Ms Bustani conceded that there were inconsistencies  in  the  evidence.
    It is accepted that some time was spent at the address in Albert  Road.
    With regard to the EEA application, she accepted  that  it  has  to  be
    taken into account.  The Appellant has a relationship with  her  sister
    and with her sister's children.  She conceded that the  Appellant  does
    not  qualify  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM.   She  said  it   is
    unreasonable that she be expected to return to Nigeria given  that  she
    has been here for eleven and a half years.  Her partner has  been  here
    for 34 years.  He has a good job and three children.  She asked  me  to
    take into account that when this issue was last considered in  2010  it
    was not conceded or accepted that there was a relationship  but  it  is
    now accepted that there is.

My Findings

24. Permission to appeal was granted in this case  because  the  Respondent
    had conceded that there was a relationship between the Appellant and Mr
    Olubayo but the Judge had not taken that into account and had  not  put
    any  questions  to  the  Appellant  about  the   genuineness   of   the
    relationship.  The genuineness of the relationship was not accepted  by
    the Respondent.  As Mr Walker said there is little documentary evidence
    of the relationship.  I did  of  course  hear  oral  evidence  from  Mr
    Olubayo.  I have a few  letters  addressed  to  the  Appellant  at  his
    address.  I accept that the couple  have  a  relationship  but  I  have
    serious doubts about the genuineness of it and about the credibility of
    the Appellant and consequentially of Mr Olubayo.

25. The submission in this case is that the Appellant and her partner  have
    been in a serious relationship since 2009, having met in 2005 but  only
    moved in together in December 2013 after Mr Olubayo's children had  all
    gone off to university. It is very difficult to make any sense  of  the
    account given of the relationship since 2009, especially  the  question
    of where the Appellant was living. Her sister  was  clear  and  adamant
    that the Appellant had lived with her constantly  until  she  moved  in
    with Mr Olubayo apart from odd nights that she may have  spent  with  a
    boyfriend.   The  Appellant  gave  a  different  account.   There   was
    conflicting evidence about where she lived at the  time  she  moved  in
    with her partner. The Appellant said she was with an aunt,  her  sister
    that she was at her house and Mr Olubayo that she was at  Albert  Road.
    The Appellant's evidence about how long she lived at  Albert  Road  was
    contradictory. She said she went to help a friend there with her child.
    She was clearly using it as her address for signing on and it  was  the
    address the Home Office had for her. Her mail  was  not  going  to  her
    sister's and was presumably, from the various pieces of  correspondence
    produced by the Home Office,   going to Albert Road.  She paid no  rent
    there but there is no explanation why.   When  her  partner  was  asked
    about Albert Road his evidence did  not  indicate  that  she  had  been
    living there permanently and that he had  visited  her  there  all  the
    time. He said she could not move in with him because  of  his  children
    but they lived with their mother and spent limited time  with  him.  He
    only had a one bedroom flat.  There was nothing in the evidence of  the
    Appellant's sister to suggest that he was  a  regular  visitor  to  her
    house and in any event the evidence of the Appellant was that  she  was
    not at her sister's. Her sister  said  she  financially  supported  her
    until she moved in with Mr Olubayo.  It is not at all clear  where  the
    Appellant was living or where the couple were spending  the  time  they
    were  together  developing  and  conducting  a  close   and   committed
    relationship. Mr Olubayo's evidence about  where  she  was  living  was
    vague to say the least given that he had  been  having  a  relationship
    with her since 2009 and had known  her  since  2005.  It  is  also  not
    plausible that he was unaware until  2013  of  her  immigration  status
    given that there must have been issues arising from the fact  that  she
    could not work to support herself and was being supported by her sister
    who has a large family to support.

26. With regard to the application as an EEA extended family  member  I  do
    not accept that this was lodged with UKBA without the Appellant's  full
    consent  and  involvement.   Even  taking  the  view  that  there   are
    solicitors who would do such a thing for money, I do  not  accept  that
    anyone would make such an application without her consent.  She  denied
    any knowledge of an appeal being granted in that case.  It seems to  me
    that if three friends decided to go down the route of  making  a  false
    application with the assistance of a third person - the Sponsor  -  the
    Appellant would be well aware of everything that was going  on  and  of
    the outcome.  It was a false application  made  without  any  basis  in
    reality.  It was an attempt to deceive the immigration  authorities  in
    this country.

27. I am unable to find that the Appellant is a witness of truth.  I do not
    accept that she  and  Mr  Olubayo  are  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship. I am not satisfied that the  Appellant   has  established
    that on the balance of probabilities she  and  Mr  Olubayo  are  living
    together in a genuine and subsisting relationship.

28. I accept that the Appellant has been in the UK since 2003 but she  does
    not meet the requirements of Paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.
    The decision was made in February  2014  so  the  original  version  of
    paragraph 276ADE (vi) applies -

         '(vi) is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in  the  UK
         for less than 20 years (discounting any period of imprisonment) but
         has no ties (including social, cultural or family) with the country
         to which he would have to go if required to leave the UK.'

29. The Appellant claims to have no ties to Nigeria but  I  do  not  accept
    that. I have found her evidence to be unreliable. She is a young  woman
    who lived in Nigeria until she was 16 years old. The people she has had
    most contact with in the UK are Nigerian. There is no credible evidence
    that she has no social, cultural or family ties to Nigeria.

30. The Appellant has not established a right to remain in the UK under the
    Immigration Rules.

31. With regard to Article 8 ECHR, given my findings I do not  accept  that
    she has a family life with Mr Olubayo which engages Article 8. There is
    no credible evidence of a family life with her sister or  her  sister's
    children which is close enough to engage Article 8.  I accept that  the
    Appellant has developed a private life in the UK but  as  I  have  said
    above she fails to meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

32. In Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT  640
    (IAC) the Tribunal said

         "... (b) after applying the requirements  of  the  Rules,  only  if
         there may be arguably good grounds for  granting  leave  to  remain
         outside them is it necessary for Article 8 purposes  to  go  on  to
         consider   whether   there   are   compelling   circumstances   not
         sufficiently recognised under them: R (on the application of) Nagre
         v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  [2013]  EWHC  720
         (Admin);

         (c) the term  "insurmountable  obstacles"  in  provisions  such  as
         Section EX.1 are not    obstacles which are impossible to surmount:
         MF (Article 8 - new rules) Nigeria [2012] UKUT  393  (IAC);  Izuazu
         (Article 8 - new rules) [2013] UKUT  45  (IAC);  they  concern  the
         practical possibilities of  relocation.  In  the  absence  of  such
         insurmountable obstacles,  it  is  necessary  to  show  other  non-
         standard and particular features demonstrating that removal will be
         unjustifiably harsh: Nagre."

33. In light of the number of years the Appellant has been in the UK I have
    considered the proportionality of her removal  outwith  the  Rules.   I
    have  borne  in mind the decision in Razgar, R (on the Application  of)
    v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2004] UKHL 27  (17  June

34. I have also considered the public interest considerations  relevant  to
    all Article 8 as set out in Section 117 of the Nationality  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 2002. These are -

         (1) The maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the
         public interest.

         (2) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3) It is in the public interest, and in particular in the
         interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4) Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

         that is established by a person at a time when the person is in the
         United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5) Little weight should be given to a private life established by
         a person at a time when the person's immigration status is
         precarious.

         (6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
             relationship with a qualifying child, and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave
             the United Kingdom.

35. I take account of the fact that the Appellant speaks English  and  that
    she would be able to work in the UK to support herself but great weight
    must be  given  to  the  fact  that  she  attempted  to  make  a  false
    application for leave to remain in the UK and that I  have  found  that
    her account in support of this appeal is not credible. I must take  the
    view that she has determined to gain leave to remain in the UK  on  any
    basis and I find that there is nothing in her private  life  to  render
    her removal disproportionate to the public interest in her removal.

36. For completeness I would  say  that  even  if  I  had  found  that  her
    relationship with Mr Olubayo  was  genuine  and  went  on  to  consider
    Appendix FM of the Rules,   there is no evidence before me to show that
    there are insurmountable obstacles  to  him  going  to  live  with  the
    Appellant in Nigeria. They formed a relationship when she had no  leave
    to be here. His children lived with their mother and are now adults and
    the fact that he does not want to give up his job and leave the  UK  to
    live in Nigeria does not constitute insurmountable obstacles.

DECISION

The determination of the First-tier Tribunal  has  been  set  aside  and  is
replaced with this decision.

The appeal of the Appellant is dismissed under the Immigration Rules and  on
human rights grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
