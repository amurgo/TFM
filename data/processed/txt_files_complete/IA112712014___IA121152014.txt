                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The First Appellant

 1. The first Appellant is Muhammad Jamil Ahmad, a citizen of Pakistan born
    on 8th December 1960.  He entered the  United  Kingdom  in  2006  as  a
    visitor.  He applied unsuccessfully for leave to remain under Article 8
    ECHR in 2010 and again in 2012.  On 17th April 2013  he  applied  under
    the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006   ("the
    Regulations") for a derivative residence card as the primary carer of a
    UK citizen.  The Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department  ("the
    Respondent") issued a decision dated 13th February  2014  stating  that
    this Appellant failed to  show  that  he  met  the  conditions  of  the
    Regulations.

 2. The Respondent's letter also stated that if the first Appellant  wished
    to apply on the basis of family and private life in  the  UK  he  would
    have to make a separate charged application under the Immigration Rules
    HC395, as amended ("the Rules"), using  the  specified  form.   In  the
    absence of such an application  it  had  not  been  considered  whether
    removal would breach Article 8 ECHR. Continuing, it was suggested  that
    if he thought that he had a right to reside in the UK as  a  matter  of
    European law, and was in a position to submit the necessary information
    to  support  an  application  for  a  derivative  residence   card   as
    recognition of that right, he might  alternatively  wish  to  submit  a
    further application.

 3. The first Appellant elected to appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  (the
    "FtT"), which dismissed his appeal by a  determination  promulgated  on
    12th May 2014.  The FtT found that he does not meet the requirements of
    the Regulations, which he does not  dispute.   It  further  found  that
    while the Appellant played an important role in family life he was  not
    the subject  of  removal  directions  and,  therefore,  any  Article  8
    consideration was academic, adding  "The  Appellant  has  already  been
    advised of the appropriate route ... for his claim to be considered  on
    the basis of family and private life."

 4. The first Appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,
    citing JM [2006] EWCA Civ 1402, [2007] Imm AR 293 as authority that the
    absence of removal directions ought not to have  precluded  substantive
    consideration of his  claim  under  Article  8  ECHR.   Permission  was
    granted on 17th June 2014.

The Second Appellant

 5. The second Appellant is Lakhwinder Kaur Sandhu, a citizen of India born
    on 11th April 1979.  She entered the UK lawfully as a spouse in 2003 or
    2004 on a visa valid for one  year,  but  remained  thereafter  without
    permission until 11th March 2013, when she  applied  for  a  derivative
    residence card under the  Regulations  as  the  primary  carer  of  her
    husband and minor child, who are both UK citizens.

 6. The Respondent refused this Appellant's application  on  17th  February
    2014, in the following terms.  Zambrano C-C4/09 did not extend a  right
    to remain to this Appellant.  She did not meet the terms of  Regulation
    18A.  Not having provided a valid passport, she had no right to  appeal
    under the Regulations.  In any event, the evidence did  not  show  that
    she was the primary carer either of her husband or of her daughter  and
    her case would fail under Regulation 15A(4A)(a)(c) accordingly.  If she
    did not choose to leave, the  Respondent  might  enforce  removal,  but
    would first give her the opportunity to make representations.  The best
    interests of her child had been considered.  If she wished to apply for
    consideration under the private  and  family  life  provisions  of  the
    Rules, she should do so  separately.   The  decision  not  to  issue  a
    derivative residence card did not require her to leave the  UK  and  if
    she  could  otherwise  demonstrate  her  right  to  reside  under   the
    Regulations, she should apply.

 7. The second Appellant did not pursue any of the alternatives  suggested.
    Rather, she appealed to the FtT.  In her grounds she contended that (a)
    the requirement to produce a valid passport had  been  put  beyond  her
    control by the Respondent and so should be waived [an issue which  does
    not seem to have been pursued further by either party]; (b) she was  in
    fact the primary carer of her husband and daughter; and (c) her removal
    would be contrary to Article 8 ECHR. The FtT dismissed this Appellant's
    appeal by its determination promulgated on 28th May 2014.

 8. Like the first Appellant, the second Appellant does not seek  to  argue
    her case further under the Regulations.  In her grounds  of  appeal  to
    the UT she contends  that  the  FtT  should  not  have  considered  the
    prospect of removal  to  be  theoretical  and  speculative,  which  was
    contrary to JM; that the FtT formed the view that she would succeed  in
    an application [under the Rules] from  abroad  and,  therefore,  should
    have allowed the appeal on the principles of Chikwamba [2008] UKHL  40,
    2008 Imm AR 700; and, finally, that the FtT should have  found  nothing
    to outweigh the best interests of the child, and should not have  taken
    account of the possibility of maintaining contact from India.

Appeals to the Upper Tribunal

 9. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  on  17th  June
    2014, with the comment that there was an interesting question about the
    extent to which Article 8 issues might be argued in  appeals  from  EEA
    decisions.  Similar issues were current in a number of appeals in which
    permission was granted around the same time.  The  present  cases  were
    listed to be heard together because of  these  connected  issues.   The
    parties are not otherwise linked.

10. On 24th August 2015 the Upper  Tribunal  promulgated  its  decision  in
    Amirteymour and Others (EEA appeals; human rights)  [2015]  UKUT  00466
    (IAC), holding that where no notice under section 120 of the  2002  Act
    has been served and where no EEA decision to remove has  been  made  an
    appellant cannot bring a human rights challenge to removal in an appeal
    under the Regulations.  It was further held that  neither  the  factual
    matrix nor the reasoning in JM has any application.

11. The Appellants' submissions (heard orally on 2nd September  2015)  were
    designed, firstly, to show that Amirteymour  was  wrongly  decided  and
    that the principle drawn from JM did apply.  Miss Irvine  also  made  a
    novel submission, with which Mr Caskie associated himself, based on the
    Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union  ("the  Charter").
    She pointed out that such an argument was recorded at paragraph  20  of
    Amirteymour, but was not resolved.

12. As Mrs Saddiq, representing the Respondent, had not had the opportunity
    to prepare a reply on this point we fixed a timetable for the  exchange
    of written submissions.

    In light of the grant of permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal in
    Amirteymour we issued a further direction,  dated  6th  November  2015,
    staying proceedings in the present appeals and  advising  that  further
    directions would follow in due course.

13. The decision of the Court of Appeal in TY (Sri Lanka) [2015]  EWCA  Civ
    1233 was published on 1st December 2015.  In brief compass,  the  Court
    of Appeal agreed with Amirteymour:  see  [36]  especially.  Jackson  LJ
    expressed the crucial distinction thus.  In JM the Respondent served  a
    section 120 notice,  which  the  consequences,  firstly,  that  if  the
    Tribunal appeal failed removal might follow without the opportunity  to
    raise human rights arguments and, secondly, that the notice enabled the
    appellant  to  advance  all  his  ECHR  arguments  for  the  tribunal's
    consideration.  TY differed from JM in that there had been no  one-stop
    notice under section 120. We observe here that a section 120 notice and
    a decision to remove under the  Regulations  are  absent  in  both  the
    present appeals. Jackson LJ went on to say:

         "35.      It is impossible to say that  the  Secretary  of  State's
             decision to withhold the residence card (a decision  which  is
             correct under the EEA Regulations) will or could cause the  UK
             to be in breach of the Refugee Convention  or  ECHR.   The  UK
             will only be in breach of these Conventions if in  the  future
             the appellant makes an asylum or human rights claim, which the
             Secretary of State and/or the Tribunals incorrectly reject.

         36.  In the result therefore I reach a similar decision ... to  ...
             Amirteymour ...

         37.  For completeness, I should add that in her  skeleton  argument
             Miss Jegarajah [counsel for the appellant] raised a number  of
             points concerning the EU Charter.  These could not affect  the
             outcome of the appeal and, very sensibly, Miss  Jegarajah  did
             not press them in oral argument."

14. By our written direction on 29th December 2015 we drew attention to  TY
    and  invited  final  written  submissions.   In  summary,  the  further
    submissions subsequently received are as follows.

The Appellants' Submissions

15. First, the Charter is primary EU law, with the same legal value as  the
    Treaties from which the right to free movement is drawn.  Insofar as it
    contains rights which correspond  to  those  guaranteed  by  ECHR,  the
    meaning and scope of these rights are to be  the  same.   Thus,  family
    life guaranteed by Article 7 of the Charter has the  same  meaning  and
    scope as that guaranteed by Article 8 of the ECHR.  The regulations are
    the implementation of EU law for the purposes  of  Article  51  of  the
    Charter.

16. Second, by way of rights to effective remedy and  good  administration,
    an individual must be able to raise a human rights argument at the same
    time as appealing an EEA decision, notwithstanding that no section  120
    notice has been issued and that the decision at issue  is  not  one  to
    remove the individual from the UK.

17. Third, Article 41(1) of the Charter provides that every person has  the
    right to have his or her affairs handled impartially, fairly and within
    a reasonable time by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies  of
    the Union.  Article 47 provides the rights to an effective remedy and a
    fair trial.  The realisation of rights conferred by EU law  should  not
    be rendered practically impossible or excessively difficult.   All  the
    rights underpinning the relevant EEA decisions have their origins in EU
    law, such that the Charter is engaged and  that  tribunal  jurisdiction
    extends to  the  determination  of  human  rights  issues.   Once  that
    jurisdiction is found to be engaged, it is argued the answer is obvious
    (here we quote from counsel's submissions):

         The Secretary of State's approach requires an appellant to not only
         submit two separate applications rather than  one,  but  to  do  so
         consecutively, with the Article 7/8 application coming  second;  to
         require payment  for  the  second  application  of  over  �600,  as
         compared with �55 for the first;  and  to  potentially  require  an
         individual to render themselves in breach of immigration law if the
         first application is refused, and prior to the  second  application
         being submitted.  ... the requirements of  effectiveness  and  good
         administration (in particular the  requirement  for  fairness)  ...
         mandate that human rights arguments ... be allowed to  be  made  in
         the manner proposed.

18. The final limb of the Appellants'  submissions  is  that  there  is  no
    statutory language which requires the narrow approach taken by the FtT,
    and no basis in EU law to interpret the Regulations and the 2002 Act as
    limiting the grounds of appeal.  On the contrary,  it  is  argued,  the
    interpretation advanced  by  the  Appellant  serves  to  vindicate  the
    fundamental rights protected by the EU legal  order  and  is  the  only
    interpretation which EU law permits.

The Respondent's Submissions

19. On behalf of the Respondent it is argued first,  that  the  Appellants'
    argument combines claims under Article 8 ECHR  and  Article  7  of  the
    Charter as if they  are  coterminous.   However,  Article  7  does  not
    provide a freestanding right to protection of  family  life  of  non-EU
    citizens.  Where a situation falls  outwith  the  scope  of  provisions
    securing freedom of movement to EU citizens,  it  has  no  application.
    Conversely, the argument runs, a right to reside under EU law need  not
    and cannot rely on Article 8 ECHR.  One cannot simply recast an Article
    8 ECHR claim as a claim under Article  7  of  the  Charter.   They  are
    different in scope.  The meaning of family life might be  the  same  in
    both guarantees, but the circumstances in which they can be invoked are
    distinct.

20. Second, it is  argued  that  Article  41  of  the  Charter  applies  to
    institutions and bodies of the European Union, not to the Secretary  of
    State and the FtT, which  are  institutions  of  the  UK,  not  of  the
    European Union.  Article 47 of the Charter,  it  is  said,  applies  to
    rights and freedoms guaranteed under the law of the EU, not  to  rights
    and freedoms guaranteed by the ECHR.

21. Third, it is argued that, in any event, if Article 47 of the Charter is
    engaged, it is not infringed by virtue of the decision in  Amirteymour.
    An appellant is not required to render himself in breach of immigration
    law if the  first  application  [under  the  Regulations]  is  refused,
    because there is nothing to prevent  a  contemporaneous  or  subsequent
    application under the Rules.

22. It is further argued that an appellant does not have to render  himself
    in breach of immigration law.  That  breach,  the  argument  runs,  has
    already occurred. Thus the appellant is not  required  to  prolong  it.
    Payment of a fee makes a remedy ineffective  only  where  an  applicant
    cannot realistically afford to pay it.   There  are  regulations  which
    provide that no fee is payable where that would be incompatible with an
    applicant's human rights.  A challenge to the legality of fees  is  not
    within tribunal jurisdiction.  The Charter is  irrelevant  in  domestic
    law to whether an appellant can rely in a tribunal  appeal  on  matters
    arising solely under the ECHR.

23. Finally, it is submitted that the relevant passage  in  TY  is  clearly
    unfavourable and an indication  that  the  point  was  unlikely  to  be
    successful if developed in oral argument.  There is no good reason  not
    to follow Amirteymour and TY.  It is not  clear  where  the  Appellants
    seek ought to identify any conflict between UK domestic law and EU law.
      Article  7  of  the  Charter,  it  is  argued,  does  not  provide  a
    freestanding right to protection of family  life  of  non-EU  citizens.
    Where an appellant seeks to advance Article 8 arguments wholly detached
    from the EEA issues under appeal, the Charter is  not  engaged.   There
    are separate legal regimes governing the application of the Charter (on
    the one hand) and that of the ECHR  (on  the  other).   The  Appellants
    argument  based  on  Article  47  of  the  Charter  is   dismissed   as
    misconceived.

The Appellants' Rejoinder

24. First, it is argued that it is not clear whether arguments  related  to
    the Charter were considered in TY but even if they were the outcome  is
    not binding, being a matter of  EU  law,  and  the  Appellants'  appeal
    should still succeed, on the arguments previously advanced. Second,  it
    is argued that the law of the EU has long  been  held  to  include  the
    right to respect for family life  as  guaranteed  by  Article  8  ECHR.
    Third, it is argued that the right to  an  effective  remedy  and  good
    administration, although addressed to the institutions of the EU, is of
    general application.

Our decision

25. Although TY is perhaps not formally binding upon  us  when  the  UT  is
    sitting in Scotland, there is no Scottish authority to contrary effect.
     We find that TY is clear, decisive and ought to be applied.  Given the
    history of the case, running in parallel with emerging  case  law,  and
    with no disrespect to submissions made on points which we now regard as
    settled, we need only briefly resolve those submissions  which  invited
    us to depart from Amirteymour and TY on the basis of  the  EU  Charter.



26. We find no authority for extending the Charter to either the SSHD's  or
    a tribunal's consideration of private and family life matters which  do
    not depend on EU law.  The Charter does not  requires  the  SSHD  or  a
    tribunal to consider such matters where appellants seek to  raise  them
    outside the terms of the scheme established in UK law for  implementing
    EU rights.

27. The UK operates a scheme in terms of the  Regulations,  the  Rules  and
    appeal  rights  governing  various  rights  of   residence.    Although
    regularly modified in its details, the overall scheme has had the  same
    shape for many years.  For the present Appellants that  scheme  is  not
    practically impossible, excessively difficult, unfair, or otherwise  in
    conflict with any general rights under the Charter, even if applicable.
     They have always been in a position  to  make  any  application  which
    might be justified by  their  circumstances,  and  to  have  it  fairly
    adjudicated upon.  In order to vindicate any rights they may have, they
    have not been required to expose themselves to any  legal  risks.   The
    mechanism of levying  fees  for  applications  based  on  human  rights
    grounds breaches no legal rights and, in this  context,  we  note  that
    exemptions from charging fees for applications are available.

28. We consider that any considerations arising from the  Charter  must  be
    resolved in exactly the same way as  considerations  arising  from  the
    ECHR.  While the United Kingdom might, in theory, lapse into breach  of
    the Charter if the SSHD, a tribunal or  a  court  were  incorrectly  to
    reject  some  rights-based  claim  this  issue  does  not  fall  to  be
    determined in these appeals.  It seems likely  that  this  is  why  the
    Court in TY considered that such a line  of  argument  would  not  have
    prospered.

29. We think it unlikely that  similar  principles,  derived  from  another
    source, and applied to the same facts,  would  result  in  a  different
    outcome.

30. Accordingly, our overarching  conclusion  is  that  these  appeals  are
    dismissed and  the  determinations  of  the  FtT  in  respect  of  both
    Appellants shall stand.

31. We acknowledge the assistance provided by the diligent arguments,  oral
    and written, of the parties' representatives.

32. No anonymity directions have been requested or made.
