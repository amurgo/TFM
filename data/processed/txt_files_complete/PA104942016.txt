For the Appellant:     Mr K Behbahani, Behbahani & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms A Holmes, HOPO


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appeals with permission against the  decision  of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Spicer to dismiss his appeal against the refusal of
    the respondent to grant him asylum in the United Kingdom.

2.   The appellant is a citizen of Iran born on 28 August 1983.  He  arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 17 June 2014 and claimed asylum  on  the  same
    day.  His claim was refused on 14 October  2014,  and  his  appeal  was
    dismissed on 5 December 2014 by IJ Birkby.  The appellant's application
    for permission to appeal the First-tier  decision  was  refused  on  28
    January 2015.

3.   The appellant lodged further submissions on 18 February  2016  claiming
    a well-founded fear  of  return  to  Iran  due  to  his  conversion  to
    Christianity.  The fresh claim was refused on 7  September  2016.   The
    respondent accepted that the appellant was a citizen of  Iran  but  did
    not accept that the appellant had genuinely  converted  from  Islam  to
    Christianity and it was not accepted that he was a  genuine  Christian.
    It was not accepted that the appellant had evangelised  in  the  United
    Kingdom, or that he would evangelise on return to  Iran.   It  was  not
    accepted that the appellant had a well-founded fear on  return  due  to
    his religion.

4.   The respondent accepted that the appellant had demonstrated  sufficient
    knowledge of the churches he attended, and it was accepted that he  had
    been baptised on 28 June 2015.

5.   At the hearing before the judge the appellant gave  oral  evidence;  as
    did Reverend Miltan Danil of Elim Iranian  Church  in  support  of  the
    appellant.

6.   The judge applied the guidance in  Devaseelan.   She  stated  that  the
    determination of IJ Birkby stood as an assessment  of  the  appellant's
    claim at the date of the determination.  The  judge  accepted  all  the
    findings of fact made by IJ Birkby.

7.   The judge stated at paragraph 57 that the only  new  evidence  supplied
    by the appellant  consisted  of  corroboration  of  his  attendance  at
    church, and evidence of his baptism.

8.   Mr  Behbahani  challenged  this  finding  arguing  that  the  appellant
    provided corroboration of three  essential  ingredients  in  his  case.
    Firstly, he provided evidence that he was living a  Christian  life  by
    those who have regular contact with  him;  secondly,  evidence  of  his
    affiliation with the life of the church, participating in  prayers  and
    sharing the good news with other Christians; and thirdly, corroboration
    of his sincerity with his faith outside the church.  In  the  light  of
    this evidence Mr Behbahani submitted that the judge was wrong to  limit
    her consideration to the evidence that she identified at paragraph  57,
    namely the  appellant's  attendance  at  church  and  evidence  of  his
    baptism.

9.   At paragraph 60 the judge  accepted  that  the  appellant  attends  the
    Iranian Church in Brighton on Monday evenings.  She also accepted  that
    the appellant attends Calvary Evangelical Church in  Brighton  and  was
    baptised on Sunday 28 June 2015.  The judge found that the  appellant's
    evidence of church attendance was supported by  the  oral  and  written
    evidence of Reverend Miltan Danil and by Mr Benjamin Alltimes, a member
    of the pastoral staff at  Calvary  Church  (P337  of  the  respondent's
    bundle) and Pastor  Philip  Wells  of  Calvary  Church  (p.410  of  the
    respondent's bundle).

10.  At paragraph 61 the judge said that the  appellant  provided  a  letter
    from Mr Wesley Goh, stating that the appellant has been involved in the
    International Caf�, and has shared his  Christian  faith  with  Muslims
    (p.411 of appellant's bundle).  The judge placed little weight  on  the
    letter because, on his own evidence the appellant has  not  evangelised
    other people.  He stated only that he had spoken to two Iranians on one
    occasion at the International Caf�.

11.  In challenging the  judge's  finding  at  paragraph  61,  Mr  Behbahani
    questioned the judge's understanding of what was meant  by  evangelical
    activities.  He referred  to  a  letter  from  Mr  Phillip  Wells,  the
    Minister  of  Calvary  Evangelical  Church,  dated  31  May  2017.   At
    paragraph 2 Mr Phillip Wells said:

         "On the subject of 'evangelising' - (see  HRF's  Witness  Statement
         paragraph 6).  Evangel is  the  Greek  word  for  'good  news'  and
         evangelism/evangelise refers to the act of spreading good  news  of
         Jesus Christ.  This may range  from  formal  prepared  proclamation
         (preaching), to campaigns and special projects  (such  as  visiting
         houses door to door), through to informal conversations about Jesus
         Christ in which the speaker is clear about his or her allegiance to
         Jesus Christ.  The word 'evangelical' in its proper sense means  'a
         person who adheres to the content and doctrines of the good news of
         Jesus Christ".

    He went  on  to  say  that  there  is  no  requirement  on  members  of
    evangelical churches to preach, or to engage in campaigns,  but  it  is
    expected that members will speak informally  about  their  faith.   The
    witness statement in paragraph 6 is correct.

12.  In light of what Phillip Wells said in his letter,  Mr  Behbahani  said
    that evangelising is not as stated by the judge, meaning going  out  to
    the streets and preaching.

13.  Mr Behbahani also referred to a letter from Mr  Benjamin  Alltimes  the
    Deacon at Calvary Evangelical Church dated 1 June  2017.   Mr  Alltimes
    said as to the matter of evangelising,

         "we do believe that it is the biblical duty of every  Christian  to
         spread the message of Christianity, however we do not  require  our
         members to do this in a formal, organised way such as  taking  part
         in evangelistic campaigns  or  events,  going  out  with  the  sole
         intention of talking to people about their faith etc.  Some members
         of our church  choose  to  participate  in  organised  evangelistic
         endeavours but many others do not and are not compelled to do so by
         our understanding of the Bible's teaching or by the  leadership  of
         our church.  However, we do believe that all Christians  should  be
         ready to talk  informally  about  their  faith  when  opportunities
         present themselves."

14.  In the light of this evidence Mr Behbahani  submitted  that  the  judge
    was wrong at paragraph 61 to place little weight on the evidence of  Mr
    Wesley Goh.

15.  Mr Behbahani also challenged the judge's finding at paragraph 62.   The
    judge said she noted that the letter from Pastor Wells at p.410 of  the
    respondent's bundle provided only  factual  evidence  relating  to  the
    appellant's church attendance (every other week since his baptism,  and
    attendance at informal sessions every two weeks).  The judge  said  the
    evidence of Pastor Wells relating to the appellant's church  attendance
    suggested that the appellant was a less regular attender than stated by
    the appellant in his own evidence.  The judge said Pastor Wells made no
    comment on the genuineness of the appellant's conversion.

16.  Mr Behbahani said that the judge erred in law in failing to consider  a
    second letter from Pastor Wells at page 333 of the appellant's  bundle.
    In  paragraph  3  of  his  letter  Pastor  Wells  concurred  with   the
    appellant's witness statement that the genuineness of someone's  deeply
    held faith could  not  be  measured  by  the  amount  of  propositional
    knowledge of Christian teaching and extra biblical traditions that they
    possess.  Mr Behbahani said what Pastor Wells was saying was  that  the
    appellant was a genuine covert to Christianity.  At paragraph 4 of  his
    letter Mr Wells confirmed that  the  appellant  was  a  member  of  the
    Christian Church in the sense that he has been baptised  and  would  be
    welcome to participate at the Lords Supper which in the  Anglican  term
    is the "Eucharist".

17.  Mr Behbahani submitted that probably the judge was expecting a  simpler
    statement from Mr Wells saying that the appellant is a genuine convert.
     In any event his argument was that the judge  did  not  consider  this
    letter at all or in totality with the letter she was  referring  to  at
    page 410 of the respondent's bundle.

18.  Mr Behbahani also challenged the  judge's  findings  at  paragraph  63.
    The judge said that she  accepted  the  evidence  of  Reverence  Miltan
    Danil, that he has observed the appellant to be a regular  attender  at
    the Iranian Church  service  on  Monday  evenings.   However,  Reverend
    Miltan Danil is based in Croydon and has no contact with the  appellant
    outside with the Monday evening services, such that he  was  unable  to
    comment on the appellant's practise of the Christian faith  outside  of
    the attendance at Monday evening services.

19.   Mr  Behbahani  submitted  that  these  findings  are  belittling   the
    appellant's evidence of the practise of his Christian  faith.   In  the
    letter from Reverend Miltan Danil dated 31 May 2017 he said that he had
    heard many good things about the appellant's  character  and  behaviour
    from others and he himself testifying this.  In his opinion this cannot
    be, unless the appellant  has  committed  himself  to  Our  Lord  Jesus
    Christ.  Mr Behbahani submitted that the judge again failed to consider
    this  evidence  in  the  round.   Failure  to  consider  this  evidence
    undermined the judge's findings at paragraph 63.

20.  Mr Behbahani submitted that whilst Pastor Wells has not  expressed  his
    view as to the genuineness of the  appellant's  conversion  in  simpler
    terms, other pastors have done so,  such  as  Reverend  Danil  who  has
    expressed such genuineness on three occasions;  twice  in  writing  and
    once in oral evidence.  In the  penultimate  paragraph  of  his  letter
    dated 9 December 2015 in the respondent's bundle, Reverend  Danil  said
    that in his opinion the appellant has committed  himself  to  the  Lord
    Jesus Christ.  Deacon Benjamin Alltimes in his letter  of  30  December
    2012 believed the appellant's conversion  was  sincere.   Mr  Behbahani
    said there was no indication in the findings that the judge  considered
    such expressions of sincerity and genuineness.

21.  Mr Behbahani also challenged the  judge's  findings  at  paragraph  66.
    The judge said that following  the  determination  of  IJ  Birkby,  the
    appellant has continued to attend church services  and  social  events.
    The judge accepted that the appellant was baptised  on  28  June  2015.
    However,  the  previous  findings  of  IJ  Birkby  cast  doubt  on  the
    credibility of the appellant.  The judge said  the  appellant  has  not
    been involved in  proselytising  activities.   The  judge  also  placed
    weight on the fact that Pastor Wells had made no comment on whether  or
    not the appellant's conversion was genuine, when  he  might  have  been
    expected to do so.

22.  At paragraph 67 the judge held that taking account of all the  evidence
    in the round, the appellant's conversion was self-serving, and did  not
    find that it was a genuine conversion.   However,  the  judge  accepted
    that the appellant attends church, has been baptised  and  has  a  wide
    knowledge of Christian doctrine.

23.  Mr Behbahani referred to a letter from  Pastor  K  Ariaman  of  Holland
    Road Baptist Church in Hove dated 21  December  2015.   Pastor  Ariaman
    said that whilst he was attending the Alpha course with the  appellant,
    he realised that he was also attending the Calvary  Church,  which  was
    also near where he lived and  with  his  blessing,  the  appellant  was
    baptised on 28 June 2015.  Mr  Behbahani  again  referred  to  Benjamin
    Alltimes' letter of 13 December 2015 in  which  he  described  all  the
    positives he sees in the appellant, not  just  participation  but  also
    living the Christian life.  He described the appellant as a dear friend
    and brother.  Mr Behbahani referred to a letter from Tim  Ison  of  the
    United International Caf�.  He said the United International Caf� is  a
    free evening hosted by members of the Holland Road Baptist  Church  for
    international students based in Brighton and Hove.  The  appellant  has
    been known to him and the team of around twelve volunteers at the  caf�
    since he started attending  around  September  2014.   He  has  been  a
    regular attendee most Wednesday evenings  since  this  time  and  is  a
    valued and well-respected member of the caf�.  Mr Behbahani  relied  on
    the letter from Wesley Goh dated 13 February 2016 also  confirming  the
    appellant's attendance at their church  services  and  his  involvement
    with the Calvary International Caf�.  Wesley  Goh  said  the  appellant
    loves studying the Bible and for this  reason,  in  February  2015,  he
    started a Bible study group with the intention to help him and  another
    Chinese man to understand the Bible in English.  This group  has  grown
    into an international Bible study group and he is  still  attending  it
    regularly.  Wesley Goh went on to say that the appellant  enjoys  being
    part of the church family and has decided  to  commit  himself  to  the
    Christian faith and was baptised at Calvary Evangelical Church in  June
    2015.  He is always willing to follow the teachings in the Bible and of
    Christ to be a kind, helpful and honest person.

24.  Mr Behbahani submitted that all these testimonies from various  members
    of the churches that the appellant has involvement with, have not  been
    challenged by the respondent.  The judge's failure to consider such key
    evidence equates to a material error of law.

25.  Mr Behbahani submitted that in the assessment of risk  on  return,  the
    respondent stated that it is clear that if the appellant's claim to  be
    Christian convert is genuine and he was returned to Iran, he  would  be
    at risk due to the alleged conversion to Christianity and the fact that
    he claims that he intends to proselyte other Iranians in the community.
     Mr Behbahani said that this was repeated by the HOPO at  the  hearing.
    In this context it was not open to the judge to go beyond what has been
    accepted by the respondent.  Mr Behbahani further relied on  the  grant
    of permission in which UTJ Kopieczek said that he  was  satisfied  that
    the FTJ arguably erred in law in her conclusion that as  a  convert  to
    Christianity, the appellant would not be at risk  on  return  to  Iran.
    Additionally, there was arguable merit  in  the  contention  that  even
    absent a genuine conversion, the appellant's social media profile would
    put him at risk.

26.  Ms Holmes submitted that the judge's reasoning was  insufficient.   She
    submitted that the judge did not  deal  with  the  welter  of  positive
    evidence.  She agreed with the submissions made by Mr Behbahani.

Findings

27.  In the light of the submissions made by Mr  Behbahani  and  Ms  Holmes'
    agreement with those submissions, I find that the judge  made  material
    errors of law for the reasons identified by Mr Behbahani.

28.  I find that the  judge  did  not  deal  with  the  welter  of  positive
    evidence which supported the appellant's claim that he was  living  the
    Christian life, that he actively participates in the life of the church
    through prayers and sharing the good news with others and the  evidence
    supporting the sincerity of his faith.

29.  I find that had the judge taken all  the  evidence  into  account,  she
    would have come to a different conclusion.  Indeed, the judge  accepted
    that  the  appellant  had  demonstrated  sufficient  knowledge  of  the
    churches he attended and had been baptised.

30.  On the evidence, I find that the judge erred in law in  her  conclusion
    that as a convert to Christianity the appellant would not be at risk on
    return to Iran.

31.  Accordingly, I find that the judge's decision cannot stand.   I  remake
    the decision.

32.  I find on the evidence drawn to my attention by Mr Behbahani  that  the
    appellant's conversion from Islam to Christianity is genuine.

33.  At paragraph 20 of the refusal letter the respondent stated that it  is
    clear that if the appellant's  claim  to  be  a  Christian  convert  is
    genuine, and he were to return to Iran, he would be at risk due to  the
    alleged conversion to Christianity and the  fact  that  he  claimed  he
    intended to proselytise to other Iranians in the community.

34.  In light of my finding that the appellant's conversion to  Christianity
    is genuine, I find that the appellant would be at  risk  on  return  to
    Iran by virtue of his conversion to Christianity.




Notice of Decision

35.  The appellant's appeal is allowed.
