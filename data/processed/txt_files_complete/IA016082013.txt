Representation:

For the Appellant: Mr P. Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent: Mr D. Bhattarai, Legal representative


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State against  a  decision  of
       the First-tier Tribunal. For convenience we refer to the  respondent
       as the Claimant.

    2. The Claimant is a citizen of Nepal, born on 13  April  1981.  On  24
       July 2012, within the currency of his existing leave, he applied for
       leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant.  His
       application was refused with reference to paragraph 245ZX(ha) of  HC
       395 (as amended) on the basis that his entry clearance or  leave  to
       remain exceeded (or would exceed) a period of five  years  study  at
       degree level or above, a period in excess of  that  permitted  under
       the Immigration Rules.

    3. His appeal against that decision was allowed by First-tier  Tribunal
       judge A.R. Williams in a decision promulgated on 11 September  2013.
       It was argued before Judge Williams that the  Bachelor  of  Business
       Administration ("BBA") for which the Claimant studied  at  Middlesex
       College  was  not  at  degree  level  within  the  meaning  of   the
       Immigration Rules. Thus, he was not caught by  the  Rule  preventing
       degree  level  study  for  more  than  five  years.  Judge  Williams
       concluded at [36] that paragraph 245ZX(ha), in referring to  courses
       at degree level, must imply a course that is a recognised degree  in
       the UK.

    4. The same argument was advanced on behalf of the Claimant before  us.
       Mr Bhattarai submitted that the BBA is not awarded by  a  university
       and so is not a degree. Mr Deller submitted that the course did  not
       have to be "degree level study" within the meaning of paragraph 6 of
       the Immigration Rules.

    5. Paragraph 245ZX(ha), so far as material to this appeal, provides  as
       follows:
           "If the course is at degree level or above, the grant  of  leave
           to remain  the  applicant  is  seeking  must  not  lead  to  the
           applicant having spent more than 5 years in the  UK  as  a  Tier
           4(General) Migrant, or as a Student, studying courses at  degree
           level or above..."


       The exceptions contained within that rule are not relevant  to  this
       appeal.

    6. The history of the Claimant's studies  in  the  UK  throws  up  some
       anomalies, as is apparent from the  succeeding  paragraphs  of  this
       determination. In reality however, the  only  question  we  have  to
       determine in  this  appeal  is  whether  the  Bachelor  in  Business
       Administration Course was a course at degree level (or above) and if
       so, whether the Claimant thus falls foul of what may be called  'the
       five year rule'. Nevertheless, for completeness and in order to  put
       our conclusions  into  context,  we  set  out  the  history  of  the
       Claimant's studies on the basis of the documents before us.

    7. Although in his witness statement at [2] the  Claimant  states  that
       his first two years of study  from  2006  were  at  the  Academy  of
       Professional  Studies  ("APS"),  on   the   Bachelor   in   Business
       Administration Course ("BBA"), his schedule of tuition fees  in  the
       same statement refers to studies at the College of  Central  London.
       The Claimant's bundle contains letters of enrolment/acceptance on  a
       course starting in April  2005,  and  then  in  January  2006.  That
       starting in January 2006 was for a BTEC Higher National  Diploma  in
       Business and Marketing. We assume, in the absence of any evidence to
       the contrary including any certificate in relation  to  the  course,
       that he did not actually  undertake  it,  or  if  he  did,  did  not
       complete it successfully.

    8. The course at APS was for a BBA, being a three year course  starting
       on 23 January 2006 until January 2009. In his witness statement  the
       Claimant states at [2] that he completed the third year of  the  BBA
       course at Middlesex College.  There  is  what  is  described  as  an
       enrolment certificate dated 16 May 2008 at  page  9  of  the  bundle
       confirming his enrolment on the course, describing it as  the  Final
       Year under the course name, with a start date of 6 May  2008  and  a
       completion date of 27 March 2009. There is however,  an  "Attendance
       Certificate" on page 10, from Middlesex College and dated 2 May 2008
       which states under the course name as follows: "Bachelor of Business
       Administration (2nd Year/2nd semester)". This is at  odds  with  the
       information on the enrolment certificate and inconsistent  with  the
       Claimant's  witness  statement  which  indicates  that   he   joined
       Middlesex College for the third year of the BBA.

    9. Again, although the Claimant says that he completed the  third  year
       of the BBA, no degree certificate has been produced. The only  other
       document from Middlesex College is an academic  transcript  dated  2
       May 2008 and said to represent the second semester  of  year  2.  Mr
       Bhattarai accepted before us that there was no degree certificate in
       respect of that course.

   10. Although Mr Bhattarai was not able to provide much assistance to  us
       in relation to the inconsistencies in the evidence to which we  have
       referred, matters are perhaps made a little clearer  from  a  letter
       dated 7 July 2008 from Bhattarai & Co Immigration  Practice  to  IND
       General Group Managed Migration Directorate, on the Tribunal's file,
       which states that the Claimant successfully completed the first year
       and the first semester of the second year of the course at  APS  but
       that for  reasons  unknown  to  him  APS  closed  down.  The  letter
       continues that thereafter the Claimant joined Middlesex  College  in
       January 2008 and successfully completed the second semester  of  the
       second year of the BBA and was then in the final year  at  Middlesex
       College.

   11. In his witness statement the Claimant states  that  after  Middlesex
       College he studied for a Foundation Diploma  in  the  Management  of
       Information Systems at London Camden College. The course is actually
       described on the Attendance Record from London Camden College  (page
       11) as a Foundation Diploma and Diploma. The  commencement  date  is
       given as 1 September 2008, finishing on 31 August 2009. At that time
       of course, according to the  Enrolment  Certificate  from  Middlesex
       College, he should have been undertaking the third year of study for
       the BBA which started on 6 May 2008 and was due to end on  27  March
       2009. He was at least awarded the Foundation Diploma (page 18) which
       is dated 20 February 2009. There is no evidence that he was  awarded
       the Diploma itself.

   12. The Claimant next embarked on a  Diploma  and  Advanced  Diploma  in
       Information Technology at Alexander College, starting on  10  August
       2009 and finishing on 11 May 2012. The  Certificates  show  that  he
       completed those courses.

   13. The course for which the  Claimant  applied  for  further  leave  to
       remain is a CIMA Business Accounting course at Shakespeare  College,
       at level 7 of the National Qualifications Framework ("NQF").

   14. The Foundation Diploma and advanced Diploma at London Camden College
       are not said on behalf of the Secretary of State  to  be  at  degree
       level or above. The Diploma  and  Advanced  Diploma  in  Information
       Technology at Alexander College are said on the academic transcripts
       to be at levels 5 and 6, respectively of the NQF. At [21]  of  Judge
       Williams' determination he states that there is no dispute but  that
       the [Advanced] Diploma at level 6 was at degree level.

   15. It has not been disputed on behalf of the  Claimant  that  the  CIMA
       Business Accounting course is above degree level. It is a three year
       course.

   16. Taking into account the level 6 course at Alexander  College  of  16
       months' duration, it is apparent that if the BBA course is  regarded
       as degree level or above, the Claimant's studies at degree level  or
       above fall within the scope of paragraph 245ZX(ha) and he would  not
       therefore, be entitled to the further leave that he seeks.

   17. Paragraph 6 of the Immigration Rules defines "degree level study" as
       follows:

             "degree level study" means a course which leads to a recognised
             United Kingdom degree at bachelor's level or above, or an
             equivalent qualification at level 6 or above of the revised
             National Qualifications Framework, or levels 9 or above of the
             Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework;

   18. The Claimant contends simply, that because the  BBA  does  not  come
       within the definition of  'degree  level  study',  and  he  has  not
       otherwise spent more than 5 years in the UK  as  a  Tier  4(General)
       Migrant, or as a Student, studying courses at degree level or above,
       he does not fall foul of the 'five year rule'.

   19. "Degree level  study"  within  paragraph  6  requires  it  to  be  a
       "recognised United Kingdom degree". There are three reasons  why  in
       our view the BBA course does not  amount  to  "degree  level  study"
       within the meaning of paragraph  6.  Firstly,  it  was  accepted  on
       behalf of the Secretary of State before the First-tier Tribunal (see
       [23]) that the BBA was not so recognised. Secondly, before the First-
       tier   Tribunal,   and   before    us,    is    an    e-mail    from
       recognised.ukdegrees@bis.gsi.gov.uk dated 20 May 2013  which  states
       that "The Academy of Professional Studies and Middlesex College  are
       not on the Recognised Bodies record, nor  are  they  on  the  Listed
       Bodies record. This means that any degree that these bodies claim to
       award will not be a recognised UK degree."

   20. Thirdly, and significantly  for  the  ultimate  conclusion  in  this
       appeal, the phrase "degree level  study"  is  not  what  appears  in
       paragraph 245ZX(ha), which refers to the course(s) being "at  degree
       level or above".

   21. For the argument on behalf of the Claimant to succeed, he would have
       to persuade us that the 'five  year  rule'  in  paragraph  245ZX(ha)
       relates only to recognised UK degrees. In order to do that, he  must
       establish that the phrase "at  degree  level  or  above"  is  to  be
       interpreted in accordance  with  the  definition  of  "degree  level
       study" in paragraph 6.

   22. We do not accept those contentions. Aside from  the  fact  that  the
       phrases are different, although we have considered  the  possibility
       of lax drafting in relation to paragraph 245ZX(ha) we note that  the
       precise phrase "degree level study" as per paragraph 6  is  used  in
       several places in the Immigration Rules, for  example  at  paragraph
       118(b)(i), (ii), (iii) and 120(e) and (f) of Appendix A.

   23. We consider that if it was intended that the 'five year rule' should
       apply only to "recognised" degree  courses,  such  would  have  been
       specified in the rule itself. The purpose of the rule plainly has as
       its objective to prevent people from repeatedly  undertaking  higher
       level courses with no apparent objective other than inherent in  the
       courses themselves.

   24. Furthermore, the APS academic transcripts describe the BBA course as
       a  degree.  The  title  of  the   course   "Bachelor   of   Business
       Administration" at the very least implies that it purports to be  at
       degree level. It has not been disputed on  behalf  of  the  Claimant
       that he was admitted to the UK to study for a  degree.  Although  he
       says in his witness statement that he  realised  that  his  previous
       courses were not recognised by any university or  reputed  examining
       board, even if he was labouring under a misapprehension,  that  does
       not alter the fact that he was undertaking a degree level course  at
       APS and then Middlesex College.

   25. The result is that the level 6 Advanced Diploma at Alexander College
       for 16 months, the two if not three years on the BBA, combined  with
       the CIMA Business Accounting course, take the  Claimant  beyond  the
       five year period set out in paragraph 245ZX(ha).

   26. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the First-tier judge erred in law
       in  concluding  that  the  Claimant  was  not  caught  by  paragraph
       245ZX(ha) with respect to the BBA course. We set his decision  aside
       and re-make it, dismissing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

   27. We do however, agree with the conclusion expressed by Judge Williams
       in respect of the Claimant's contention  that  this  aspect  of  the
       Immigration Rules should not apply to him because he arrived in  the
       UK before paragraph 245ZX(ha) was introduced. Although Mr  Bhattarai
       attempted to revive that argument before us, as we indicated, we see
       no merit in it.

   28. As regards Article 8 of the ECHR, it was submitted that the Claimant
       is in the middle of his studies  on  the  CIMA  Business  Accounting
       course. We note from the CAS that the course is  due  to  finish  in
       July 2015. We take into  account  what  the  Claimant  says  in  his
       witness statement about having spent over  �80,000  on  his  studies
       since his arrival. We also take into account the evidence he gave to
       the First-tier Tribunal in relation to his studies (see [15]).

   29. Undoubtedly the Claimant has established a private life  in  the  UK
       since 2006, and the Secretary of State's decision will amount to  an
       interference with that private life.

   30. Moving directly to the issue of proportionality, the other Article 8
       steps being unarguable, apart from the fact of his studies there was
       no evidence before us in relation to his private life.  Although  he
       is likely to have spent  a  large  sum  on  his  education,  he  has
       qualifications which no doubt he can put to good use on  his  return
       to Nepal. Alternatively, there is no reason to suppose that he could
       not make an application for entry clearance for a further period  of
       study.

   31. The Claimant would have known that his status in  the  UK  was  only
       ever temporary. He embarked on the  CIMA  course  knowing  that  his
       application for further leave to remain had been refused and that he
       might well have to leave the UK in consequence.

   32. We are entirely satisfied that the decision to refuse further  leave
       to remain is a proportionate one in the context  of  the  legitimate
       aim of the economic well being of the country expressed through  the
       maintenance of an effective immigration control.

   33. Lastly, we note that the decision to refuse further leave to  remain
       was made at the same time as  a  decision  to  remove  the  Claimant
       pursuant to section 47 of the Immigration,  Asylum  and  Nationality
       Act 2006. That decision was made  on  7  January  2013,  before  the
       coming into force of section 51 of the Crime  and  Courts  Act  2013
       which  legitimises  the  simultaneous  making  of  section  47   and
       variation decisions. Although the Claimant has not raised the  issue
       of the section 47 removal decision being not in accordance with  the
       law (following Adamally and Jaferi (section  47  removal  decisions:
       Tribunal Procedures) [2012] UKUT 00414 (IAC)), we would  not  expect
       the Secretary of State to take steps to remove the Claimant pursuant
       to the original section 47 decision.

Decision

   34. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the  making  of  an
       error on a point of law. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  is
       set aside and the decision re-made dismissing the appeal  under  the
       Immigration Rules and under Article 8 of the ECHR.



Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek
                                                 7/04/14
