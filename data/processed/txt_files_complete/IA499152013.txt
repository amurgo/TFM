Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms C T Patry, Counsel
      (instructed by J McCarthy Solicitors)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1.     The Appellant (the Secretary of State) appealed with  permission
         granted  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  TRP  Hollingworth  on  24
         November 2014 against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
         Judge Seifert who had allowed the Appellant's  appeal  against  the
         refusal of her application for leave to remain, on Article  8  ECHR
         family life grounds only, as the spouse of a British Citizen  in  a
         determination promulgated on 6 October 2014.


    2.     The Respondent is a national of Jamaica, born on 24  June  1984,
         who had entered the United Kingdom as a visitor  in  December  2003
         and had remained since then once her initial  leave  to  enter  had
         expired.   She had known her husband Mr  James  Burke  since  2006.
         They had married  on  20  August  2011.   He  exceeded  the  income
         requirements under Appendix FM.  The  Respondent  had  applied  for
         leave to remain in 2013, which was refused, initially without right
         of appeal.  The Removal Directions subsequently made on 12 November
         2013 restricted the Respondent's right  of  appeal  to  an  out  of
         country appeal only, however a duty judge  took  the  view  that  a
         human rights claim had been made prior  to  the  issue  of  Removal
         Directions and so the Respondent  was  permitted  to  continue  her
         appeal in country.  That decision, although perhaps erroneous,  was
         not appealed by the Secretary of State and cannot now be reopened.


    3.      Judge  Seifert  found  that  the  Respondent  met  all  of  the
         requirements of Appendix FM save for prior  entry  clearance.   She
         considered that it would not be  reasonable  for  the  Respondent's
         husband  to  travel  to  Jamaica  to  support  an  entry  clearance
         application, nor that the couple could relocate  to  Jamaica.   The
         judge found that EX.1(b) applied.  The judge accepted the  couple's
         reasons for not applying  to  regularise  the  Respondent's  status
         sooner.  The judge found that the  Respondent  retained  some  ties
         with Jamaica, including her elderly grandmother.   The  judge  also
         found that there were  exceptional,  compassionate  and  compelling
         circumstances which  warranted  consideration  of  Article  8  ECHR
         outside the Immigration Rules.  The judge allowed the appeal  under
         the Immigration Rules.  Had it been necessary, the judge  indicated
         that she would have allowed the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.


    4.     Judge Hollingworth considered it arguable that  Judge  Seifert's
         decision was flawed, in that the Respondent's partner had  connived
         at her illegality, and where the  Respondent's  position  had  been
         precarious in terms of her  immigration  status.   The  couple  had
         known of the position since 2006.  The Article 8 ECHR decision  was
         also arguably wrong in that insufficient weight had been  given  to
         the public interest.


    5.     Standard directions were made by the  tribunal,  including  that
         the decision would be  remade  immediately  in  the  event  that  a
         material error of law were found.  A rule 24  notice  opposing  the
         Secretary of State's appeal was filed on the Respondent's behalf.


    6.     Mr Tarlow for the Appellant relied on the  onwards  grounds  and
         the grant of permission to appeal.  The judge's decision was  wrong
         in all material particulars.  EX1 was not engaged.  There had  been
         inadequate  consideration  of   relocation   and   of   the   other
         possibilities which existed  for  the  couple.   The  determination
         should be set aside, with the appeal remade and dismissed.


    7.     Ms Patry for the Respondent relied  on  her  skeleton  argument.
         The judge's decision had been open to her.   The  judge  had  found
         that there were genuine reasons why no application  had  been  made
         sooner.   The  judge  had  been  right  to  find  that  there  were
         insurmountable obstacles to the  continuation  of  family  life  in
         Jamaica.  The relationship was genuine.  The  judge  was  bound  to
         apply  EX.1  in  the  light  of  her  findings  that   there   were
         insurmountable obstacles. VW (Uganda) [2009] EWCA Civ 5 showed that
         reasonableness was the correct test.  Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40  was
         relevant.


    8.     At the conclusion of submissions the tribunal indicated that  it
         found that the judge had fallen into material error of law, for the
         reasons identified in the grant of permission  to  appeal,  and  as
         further developed in Mr Tarlow's submissions.  The judge's  reasons
         for  finding  that  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
         continuation of family life in Jamaica were deficient.   The  judge
         had failed to provide adequate reasons for finding that it was  not
         reasonably open to the Respondent  to  return  to  her  country  of
         nationality and to submit an entry clearance application, sponsored
         by her husband, to join him in the United Kingdom.  It was  obvious
         that the husband would not have to give up his  employment  in  the
         United Kingdom as he could take  leave  for  some  or  all  of  the
         waiting time and join her in Jamaica if he wished.   Alternatively,
         the period of absence of the Respondent was likely to be between  6
         weeks and 3 months, a separation  which  could  not  be  considered
         excessive given that (a) the Respondent was a long term  overstayer
         and (b) her husband had been well  aware  of  her  lack  of  lawful
         status when they married.   The realistic and practical alternative
         of an entry clearance application, likely to be  successful,  meant
         that the issue of insurmountable obstacles did not  arise,  because
         any separation would be a temporary one.    That  was  the  process
         laid down by parliament.  Patel v SSHD [2012] EWCA  Civ  741  shows
         that there is no general dispensing power vested  in  the  tribunal
         for Article  8  ECHR  appeals.   Moreover,  the  Immigration  Rules
         prescribe that fees are payable for spouse settlement and that  the
         specified documents set out in  Appendix  FM-SE  must  be  checked.
         There was no reason why the Respondent should have been excused  or
         exempted such requirements.  EX.1 was inapplicable.  The  Secretary
         of State's appeal was allowed.


    9.     The determination must be and was accordingly  set  aside.   The
         determination had to be remade. The parties' names  now  revert  to
         their original titles for clarity and convenience in the  remainder
         of this determination.


    10.    Ms Patry for the Appellant made further submissions.  There  was
         evidence in the form of a death certificate  that  the  Appellant's
         grandmother in Jamaica had died.  That meant that there were now no
         remaining ties and so the appeal  should  succeed  under  paragraph
         276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules.   In  any  event,  there  were
         compassionate and compelling circumstances.  That  meant  that  the
         appeal under  Article  8  ECHR  (family  life)  should  succeed  on
         proportionality grounds.  It was pointless requiring the  Appellant
         to leave the  United  Kingdom  just  to  make  an  entry  clearance
         application which would succeed. The appeal should be allowed.


    11.    There was nothing further which Mr Tarlow wished to add.


    12.    The tribunal indicated at the conclusion of further  submissions
         that the appeal would have to be dismissed, with its  determination
         reserved.


    13.    It was accepted that the Appellant could not  meet  Appendix  FM
         for want  of  entry  clearance.   The  judge  had  found  that  the
         Appellant's grandmother was among her remaining  ties  to  Jamaica.
         That particular tie has recently gone but the Appellant retains her
         Jamaican nationality.  She was last in Jamaica as a child of 8, but
         of course English is spoken there and it is a Commonwealth  country
         with a vibrant culture which is well known in London.  The tribunal
         is not satisfied that the Appellant has lost  all  of  her  social,
         cultural or family ties to Jamaica.  She remains unable to  satisfy
         paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules.


    14.    There may be scope for differences of view  as  to  whether  the
         Appellant is able to show exceptional, compassionate or  compelling
         circumstances such as to require the Secretary of State to consider
         the exercise of discretion  outside  the  Immigration  Rules  under
         Article 8 ECHR, but the tribunal will accept Judge  Seifert's  view
         that such circumstances existed.  The live issue for Razgar  [2004]
         UKHL 27 purposes is proportionality.


    15.    The answer is clear.  The Appellant is in a position to  satisfy
         the relevant Immigration Rules under Appendix FM,  which  prescribe
         entry clearance procedures and the payment of the  prescribed  fee.
         There was no evidence that the Appellant would be unable to  return
         to Jamaica safely and to stay there for so long  as  is  necessary,
         with  or  without  her  husband,  to  make   an   entry   clearance
         application, have her documents checked and return  to  the  United
         Kingdom once her visa was granted.  The likely period of separation
         will not produce unduly harsh consequences and the parties will  be
         able to maintain contact in the event of such temporary separation.
         Obtaining entry clearance will in any event be a far preferable and
         faster course to settlement for the Appellant than  via  Article  8
         ECHR.  Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40 and MA (Pakistan) [2009]  EWCA  Civ
         953 are not comparable or relevant to  the  facts  of  the  present
         appeal, where the Appellant is a long term overstayer whose  spouse
         was complicit in her overstay.   Her  return  for  entry  clearance
         cannot be regarded as an empty, bureaucratic exercise.


    16.    It follows that the Appellant's appeal must be dismissed.




    DECISION


    The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law. The appeal of the Secretary of State is allowed.


    The determination is set aside and remade as follows:


    The original Appellant's appeal is DISMISSED


    There can be no fee award as the appeal was dismissed
