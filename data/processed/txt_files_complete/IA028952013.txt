                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                DETERMINATION



   1. On 24 June 2013 I considered an application for permission  to  appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal. I found that the Judge in  the  First-tier  had
      made no arguable error  of  law  in  his  determination  when  he  had
      considered the merits of the appellant's against  the  refusal  of  an
      extension of stay but that it was arguable that he should have allowed
      the appeal against the decision of the  respondent  to  issue  removal
      directions under section 47 of the Immigration, Nationality and Asylum
      Act 2006.


   2. I directed that unless I received submissions to the  contrary  within
      14 days I would substitute for the decision of  the  judge  dismissing
      the appeal against the refusal of the extension of stay a decision  to
      dismiss the appeal against that refusal and a decision  to  allow  the
      appeal against the decision to remove under Section 47. The respondent
      has agreed to this curse of action. there has been  no  response  form
      the appellant. I therefore  now make the following  decision:


 Decision
       The appeal against the refusal of the extension of stay and on human
       rights grounds is dismissed.
               The appeal against the decision to remove  under  Section  47
       is allowed.





Signed                                  Date: 18 September 2013
