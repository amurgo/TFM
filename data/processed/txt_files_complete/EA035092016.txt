                              MR MD MOHIN UDDIN
                       (ANNONYMITY DIRECTION NOT MADE)

                                     and


                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance
For the Respondent:    Mrs Z Kiss, a senior Home Office presenting officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction


   1. I checked the court file and noted that the appellant  was  served  at
      the last address on file with the notice of hearing. I decided that it
      was in the interests of justice to proceed with the hearing.

   2.  I do not need to set out the background  to  this  case  because  the
      respondent accepts that there was an error of law  in  the  First-tier
      Tribunal's decision. The decision of the respondent that was  appealed
      against was the refusal to issue a residence card to the appellant  as
      an extended family member under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic
      Area) Regulations 2006.

   3. The First Tier Tribunal concluded  that  it  had  no  jurisdiction  to
      entertain the appeal following  the  case  of  Sala  (EFMs:  Right  of
      Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411.

   4. In the light of Khan v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
      [2017] EWCA Civ 1755, the First-tier Tribunal  was  wrong  in  law  to
      conclude that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal.

   5. I therefore  set  aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal,
      pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the Tribunals, Courts and  Enforcement
      Act 2007.

   6. Judge Plumtree did not decide any issues of fact.  I  therefore  remit
      the case to the First-tier Tribunal at Harmondsworth to  be  heard  by
      any judge other than judge Plumtree on the next available date.

Decision

The appellant's appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
allowed. The case is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal  at  Harmondsworth
to be heard on the next available date.
