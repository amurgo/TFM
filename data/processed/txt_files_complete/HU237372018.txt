Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Martin, instructed by Londonium Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Melvin, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The appellant is a Jamaican national who was born on 24  November  1961.
   She appeals against a decision which was issued by  First-tier  Tribunal
   Judge  Head  on  3  July  2019,  dismissing  her  appeal   against   the
   respondent's refusal of her human rights claim.




 Background

2. The appellant entered the UK as a visitor on 2 January 2002.  Her  leave
   to enter expired six months later and she  overstayed.   A  little  over
   nine  years  later,  she  applied  for  leave  to  remain  outside   the
   Immigration Rules.  That application was  refused  without  a  right  of
   appeal in October 2011.  The appellant remained in the UK.  In  February
   2015, she was served with a notice  that  she  was  present  in  the  UK
   unlawfully. That prompted her to make a further application for leave to
   remain on Article 8 ECHR grounds, which she did on 11 March  2015.   The
   application was refused on 26 May 2015 and the appellant appealed to the
   First-tier Tribunal.  The appeal was heard the following year  by  Judge
   Bennett.  In his decision, which was issued on 1 September  2016,  Judge
   Bennett accepted that the applicant was in a relationship with a British
   gentleman named Mr Brown but he found that it would be proportionate  to
   remove  her  from  the  United  Kingdom.   He   dismissed   the   appeal
   accordingly.  The appellant sought permission  to  appeal  against  that
   decision but did not secure leave.  Her appeal rights were exhausted  on
   24 March 2017.

3. The appellant did not leave the United Kingdom.  On 12 April  2017,  she
   made a further application for leave to remain as  Mr  Brown's  partner.
   The respondent considered whether the further  representations  amounted
   to a fresh human rights claim, under paragraph 353  of  the  Immigration
   Rules.  She concluded that it did not.  This adverse decision carried no
   right of appeal and the appellant's solicitors issued  a  Letter  Before
   Action,  threatening  judicial  review  proceedings.   This  caused  the
   respondent to issue an amended decision on 12 November  2018,  accepting
   that the further representations amounted to a fresh claim but  refusing
   that claim on the merits.  This is the decision under appeal.

4. In her decision, the respondent concluded that the appellant was not  Mr
   Brown's partner, as defined by Gen 1.2 of Appendix FM of the Immigration
   Rules.  She did not accept that there were insurmountable  obstacles  to
   the continuation of family life in Jamaica.  She  did  not  accept  that
   paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Immigration Rules applied.  Nor  did  she
   consider  that  there  were  exceptional   circumstances   outside   the
   Immigration Rules which rendered the appellant's removal from the United
   Kingdom contrary to Article 8 ECHR.

 The Appeal Before the First-tier Tribunal

5. Before Judge  Head,  the  appellant  was  represented  by  counsel,  the
   respondent by a Presenting Officer.  Judge Head refused  an  adjournment
   application and then considered the issues with the advocates.   Counsel
   (not Mr Martin) noted that it was accepted by the  respondent  that  the
   Financial Requirements of Appendix FM were  satisfied.   The  Presenting
   Officer indicated that he would be relying on Judge  Bennett's  decision
   and on Devaseelan [2003]  Imm  AR  1:  [5].   It  was  agreed  that  the
   appellant and the sponsor were still unable to meet the requirements  of
   the Immigration Rules: [6].

6. Judge Head took Judge  Bennett's  decision  as  her  starting  point  in
   accordance with Devaseelan, although she noted that the Court of  Appeal
   had subsequently emphasised the inherent flexibility in the  guidelines:
   [20].  At [21]-[25], the judge set out various sections of  the  earlier
   decision.  She then turned to the more recent evidence.  She noted  that
   there was some expert evidence before her but that neither advocate  had
   relied upon it in submissions: [27]-[32].   At  [34],  she  stated  that
   there was nothing before  her  which  caused  her  to  depart  from  the
   findings reached in the previous decision  and  she  then  set  out  her
   reasons for that conclusion.  She did  not  accept  that  the  appellant
   could meet the Immigration Rules for the reasons she gave at  [35]-[38].
   In respect of the appellant's relationship with Mr  Brown,  it  remained
   the case that the appellant was unable  to  meet  the  definition  of  a
   partner despite the fact that she and he were engaged because  paragraph
   E-LTRP 1.12 of Appendix FM provided that the applicant's  partner  could
   not be a fianc�e unless the applicant was  granted  entry  clearance  in
   that capacity.   In  respect  of  the  appellant's  private  life  under
   paragraph 276ADE(1)(i), the judge concluded that the appellant would not
   face any real adversity on return to Jamaica: [37].

7. The judge then turned to consider Article 8 ECHR outside the Immigration
   Rules.  She directed herself in accordance with Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27;
   [2004] 2 AC 368.  She accepted that  the  appellant  had  established  a
   substantial private and family life in the United  Kingdom:  [41].   She
   was satisfied that the respondent's decision was in accordance with  the
   law: [43].  She reminded herself of what had been said  by  the  Supreme
   Court in Agyarko [2017] UKSC 11; [2017] 1  WLR  823  and  that  she  was
   required, in considering  the  proportionality  of  the  decision  under
   appeal, to consider the human rights of not only  the  appellant:  [44]-
   [45].  She accepted that the appellant was not a burden  on  the  public
   purse but she considered that to be a neutral matter in  the  assessment
   of proportionality: [47].  She noted that the  appellant's  private  and
   family life in the UK had accrued whilst  she  was  unlawfully  present:
   [48].  At [49]-[50], the judge concluded her decision as follows:

         "[49]    Taking into account all the evidence, I do not  find  that
         the appellant's departure from the UK will result in  unjustifiably
         harsh consequences.   It  is  of  course  understandable  that  the
         sponsor would prefer the appellant to stay and that  the  appellant
         wishes  to  stay  in  the  UK  with  the  sponsor.   However,  this
         preference  does  not   demonstrate   exceptional   or   compelling
         circumstances.  Both the appellant and the sponsor have links  with
         Jamaica.  I find that the appellant could return to Jamaica  either
         to live, or to make a suitable application for entry  clearance  to
         join Mr Brown as his fianc� (sic) or his spouse, if they  chose  to
         do so.

         [50] I am satisfied that there are no exceptional and/or compelling
         circumstances which warrant a grant of leave to the appellant under
         Article 8 outside the  Immigration  Rules.   I  conclude  that  the
         consequences of the respondent's  decision  are  not  unjustifiably
         harsh, when considered in conjunction with  all  relevant  factors.
         Consequently, the appellant's Article 8 appeal falls for dismissal.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

8. The grounds of appeal were not settled by trial counsel or by Mr  Martin
   and are rather diffuse.  Permission to appeal was granted by a judge  in
   the First-tier Tribunal with regrettably  little  focus  on  the  points
   which were considered to be particularly arguable.

9. Mr Martin made focussed submissions in which he developed two  principal
   points.   He  submitted,  firstly,  that  there  had  been  no  adequate
   resolution of the  submissions  which  had  been  made  in  relation  to
   Chikwamba [2008] UKHL 40; [2008] 1 WLR 1420.  Judge  Bennett  had  found
   that Chikwamba did not apply because the Financial Requirements  of  the
   Appendix  FM  were  not  met.   The  position  before  Judge  Head   was
   demonstrably different and  she  erred,  he  submitted,  in  failing  to
   consider whether the appellant would  inevitably  be  successful  in  an
   application for entry clearance.  Secondly, he submitted that there  had
   been no adequate consideration of Mr Brown's circumstances.  He had  set
   out in his statement the reasons why he could not  relocate  to  Jamaica
   with the appellant and the judge had failed to engage with that evidence
   at all, despite her self-direction at [45].  The appellant and Mr  Brown
   had been unable to get married because the respondent had  her  passport
   and it was disproportionate to  hold  against  her  the  fact  that  she
   remained unmarried and unable to meet the  Immigration  Rules  in  those
   circumstances.

10. Mr Melvin submitted that there had been  no  successful  appeal  against
   Judge Bennett's decision and nothing had really changed since then.  The
   only material change was that the appellant had decided not to leave the
   United Kingdom and to accrue yet more unlawful residence.  The judge had
   been entitled to rely upon s117B of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
   Asylum Act 2002 and to conclude that  the  appellant  should  return  to
   Jamaica to apply for entry clearance.

11. In  response,  Mr  Martin  noted  that  it  had  been  accepted  by  the
   respondent that the appeal had a realistic prospect  of  success,  since
   that was the reason that a further right of appeal had  been  permitted.
   The material change in circumstances since Judge Bennett's decision  was
   the clarification of the Chikwamba principle in  Agyarko  and  the  fact
   remained that Judge Head had failed to address the application  of  that
   principle to the facts of the appellant's case.

12. We reserved our decision.

Discussion

13. It is not abundantly clear to us that the Chikwamba argument, which  was
   front and centre in Mr Martin's submissions, was advanced  before  Judge
   Head.   The  point  was  certainly  raised  in  writing,  in  additional
   submissions which featured in a supplementary bundle and in  a  document
   which was emailed to the FtT(IAC) on 17 June  2019.   We  see  in  those
   documents reference to the point which was  certainly  recorded  in  the
   early paragraphs of the judge's decision; the sponsor  was  demonstrably
   earning more than �18,600 and the reason  given  by  Judge  Bennett  for
   finding that Chikwamba did not apply had arguably fallen away.   In  the
   judge's note of counsel's submissions, however, it seems  to  have  been
   submitted that the  appellant  would  be  likely  to  be  refused  entry
   clearance because of her immigration history.

14. Despite those concerns, we think it safer  to  adopt  the  course  urged
   upon us by Mr Martin.  It is clear that submissions  on  Chikwamba  were
   made in writing and we have no clear indication, whether in the  judge's
   decision or in her Record of Proceedings, that the point was  positively
   abandoned.  In those circumstances, we  are  satisfied  that  the  judge
   erred in law in failing to resolve those submissions.  She concluded her
   decision with reference to the  possibility  of  the  appellant  seeking
   entry clearance as Mr Brown's partner but she failed to consider whether
   she was certain to be granted entry  clearance  or  whether  the  public
   interest nevertheless required her to return to make  that  application:
   Agyarko and Kaur [2018] EWCA Civ 1423 refer.

15. We do not consider that error to be a material one,  however.   Had  the
   judge turned her mind to the question posed at [51] of Agyarko  (whether
   the appellant was certain to be granted entry clearance as a partner  if
   she applied for the same), the only rational conclusion she  could  have
   reached was adverse to the appellant.  It is correct to observe, as  did
   counsel before us and before the FtT, that  the  Financial  Requirements
   which were not met before Judge Bennett had been addressed before  Judge
   Head.  As an applicant  for  leave  to  remain,  paragraph  E-LTRP  1.12
   prevents her from being Mr  Brown's  "partner",  as  defined,  but  that
   difficulty would not apply in an application for entry clearance.

16.  The  difficulty  for  the  applicant  is  not  with   the   substantive
   requirements of Appendix FM but with her immigration  history,  and  the
   effect this might have on a future application for entry clearance.   As
   counsel before the FtT seemingly recognised, her immigration history  is
   sufficiently bad that she is not certain to be granted entry  clearance.
   An Entry Clearance Officer might, instead, take the view that  she  fell
   to be refused entry clearance with reference to paragraph 320(11).   The
   extent of her overstaying, her repeat applications and  her  failure  to
   return to Jamaica after the dismissal of her appeal arguably amount to a
   significant  frustration  of  the  Immigration  Rules  with  aggravating
   features.  Given her failure to return after Judge  Bennett's  decision,
   her circumstances are obviously very different from those considered  by
   the Upper Tribunal in PS (India) [2010] UKUT 440 (IAC).  It  cannot,  in
   these circumstances, be a certainty that a future application for  entry
   clearance would succeed.

17. Even if the appellant were certain to be  granted  entry  clearance,  we
   consider this to be a case in which what was said by the Court of Appeal
   in Kaur [2018] EWCA Civ 1423 must be recalled.  Having set out what  was
   said by Lord Brown in Chikwamba and by Lord Reed in  Agyarko,  Holyroyde
   LJ (with whom Richards and Asplin LJJ agreed) stated at [45]:

         "It is relevant  to  note  that  [Lord  Reed]  there  spoke  of  an
         applicant who was "certain to be granted  leave  to  enter"  if  an
         application were made from outside the UK, and said that in such  a
         case there might be no public interest in removing  the  applicant.
         That, in  my  view,  is  a  clear  indication  that  the  Chikwamba
         principle will require a fact-specific  assessment  in  each  case,
         will only apply in a very  clear  case,  and  even  then  will  not
         necessarily result in a grant of leave to remain."

18. In this case, had the judge turned her mind squarely  to  the  issue  of
   whether of  whether  there  was  a  public  interest  in  the  appellant
   returning to Jamaica to make an entry clearance application (which,  for
   these purposes, would be bound to succeed), she could only have  reached
   one rational answer.  The appellant's immigration history  is  terrible.
   She overstayed by a significant margin and failed to make an application
   to regularise her position for nine years.  When  that  application  was
   refused, she did not leave.  When her subsequent appeal was properly and
   lawfully dismissed by the FtT, she did not leave.  She has continued  to
   develop her private and family life with Mr Brown in the United  Kingdom
   despite the conclusions reached by Judge Bennett.  There is a clear  and
   obvious public interest in such an individual  being  required  to  seek
   entry clearance even if that application would be  certain  to  succeed.
   That is particularly so when the both of the parties to the relationship
   are adults who would have been fully aware of that risk from the  outset
   of their relationship.

19. For the reasons  above,  we  come  to  the  clear  conclusion  that  the
   principle in Chikwamba, as examined in  the  subsequent  authorities  to
   which we have referred, would not have improved the appellant's  Article
   8 ECHR case even if it had been considered by  Judge  Head.   Mr  Martin
   does not establish a material error of law in her decision on the  basis
   of this submission, therefore.

20. Mr Martin also submitted that the  judge  had  failed  to  consider  the
   circumstances of Mr Brown.  She had failed to consider the evidence that
   there were insurmountable obstacles to his relocation to Jamaica and had
   failed to consider  the  impact  on  him  of  his  separation  from  the
   appellant.   As  with  the  first  submission,  we  consider  it  to  be
   established that the judge erred in law in  this  respect.   She  should
   have considered whether  there  were  insurmountable  obstacles  to  the
   appellant and Mr Brown relocating to Jamaica.  The  importance  of  that
   consideration  in  the  assessment  of  proportionality  is  clear  from
   Agyarko, amongst other domestic and ECtHR authorities.

21. As with the first submission, however, we do not consider this error  on
   the part of the judge to be material.  We are conscious of the fact that
   the threshold for materiality is a low one (IA (Somalia) [2007] EWCA Civ
   323; [2007] Imm AR 685 refers, at [15]).  Nevertheless, on the  evidence
   before  the  FtT,  the  judge  could  have  reached  only  one  rational
   conclusion on this point.  The  obstacles  to  Mr  Brown  relocating  to
   Jamaica were set out in his statement.  He is employed in this  country.
   He has only been to Jamaica twice.  He has children and grandchildren in
   this country.  His three children are independent adults who  (according
   to the Record of Proceedings) live in Clapham and Brixton.   When  asked
   before the judge whether he could relocate, he said merely that it would
   be difficult to start all over again.  That is almost certainly the case
   but the appellant has children in Jamaica and there is  nothing  in  the
   evidence which even begins to suggest that the stringent test imposed by
   the ECtHR in Jeunesse v The Netherlands (2015) 60 EHRR 17  was  arguably
   met.  Mr Martin's related  criticism  that  the  judge  failed  to  give
   separate consideration to Mr Brown's position  falls  away  when  it  is
   understood that there are no insurmountable  obstacles  to  family  life
   between him and the appellant continuing in Jamaica.

22. Mr Martin also sought  to  develop  a  submission  in  relation  to  the
   decision of Upper Tribunal Judge  Jarvis  in  Aswatte  [2010]  UKUT  476
   (IAC).  The judicial headnote to the decision is as follows:

         (1)  The Immigration Rules make no provision for the  admission  of
         fianc�(e)s of refugees who are in the United Kingdom  with  limited
         leave. In FH (Post-flight spouses) Iran [2010] UKUT 275 (IAC),  the
         Upper Tribunal found that the spouse  of  a  refugee  with  limited
         leave was in an unjustifiably worse position than  the  spouses  of
         students,  businessmen  etc,  where  the  immigration  rules   make
         provision for a spouse to enter with  limited  leave.  Unlike  such
         persons, the refugee could not return home to  enjoy  married  life
         there.

         (2)  By the same token, a refugee cannot return home  in  order  to
         marry the fianc�(e) and it may be unreasonable to expect the couple
         to marry in a third country. Where that is the case, and where  all
         the requirements of paragraph 290 of the rules are met,  save  that
         relating  to  settlement,  it  is  unlikely   that   it   will   be
         proportionate to refuse the admission of the fianc�(e).

23. Mr Martin's submission in relation to this  decision  was  not  advanced
   before the First-tier Tribunal.  As we understood  him,  the  point  was
   that it was  disproportionate  for  the  Immigration  Rules  to  draw  a
   distinction (in E-LTRP 1.12) between those who entered as  fianc�es  and
   those who became engaged in the United Kingdom.  We do not agree.  There
   is a clear basis in public policy for requiring those who become engaged
   in the United Kingdom to return to their countries of origin in order to
   make the proper application for entry  clearance.   In  any  event,  the
   point cannot take the appellant any distance because she would be  bound
   to fail under the in-country Rules even if she was treated as Mr Brown's
   partner.  That  is  because  she  cannot  meet  the  Immigration  Status
   Requirement under the 5 year route and she cannot, as we have  explained
   above, meet the insurmountable obstacles exception in EX1 under the  Ten
   Year Route.

24. In summary,  we  accept  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  erred  in  the
   respects we have set out above  but  we  consider  that  it  undoubtedly
   reached the correct conclusion in  the  appellant's  case.   She  has  a
   lengthy history of failing to show any regard for  immigration  control.
   There are no insurmountable  obstacles  to  her  relationship  with  the
   sponsor continuing in Jamaica.  There is a  cogent  public  interest  in
   expecting her to return to make  an  application  for  entry  clearance.
   This was a case of precarious family life from the outset and, as in  TZ
   (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 1109; [2018] Imm AR 1301  there  was  nothing
   which began to amount to the very strong or compelling claim  which  was
   required to outweigh the public interest in  immigration  control.   The
   judge did not err materially in her decision to dismiss  the  appeal  on
   Article 8 ECHR grounds and that decision shall stand.



Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal did not err materially in  law  and  the  appeal  is
dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
