               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals to the Upper Tribunal against a decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal dated 24 September 2019 dismissing her human rights
    claim. I issued  directions  on  16  June  2020  having  expressed  the
    preliminary view that the matter of  whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    erred in law such that its  decision  fell  to  be  set  aside  may  be
    determined without a hearing. The Secretary of State has  responded  to
    those directions; the appellant's  representatives  have  not.  I  have
    decided to proceed to determine  this  appeal  under  Rule  34  of  the
    Tribunal (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  without  having  heard  from  the
    appellant's representatives because I intend to allow  the  appeal  and
    return it to the First-tier Tribunal for that Tribunal  to  remake  the
    decision; it follows that the appellant will not suffer any conceivable
    detriment as a result of my decision as his appeal has succeeded.

 2. In his written submission, Mr Whitwell, Senior Home  Office  Presenting
    Officer, writes:

         "9.  At the outset, it is accepted that the FtTJ  materially  erred
         in committing  a  procedural  irregularity  which  was  capable  of
         affecting the fairness of the hearing.

         10.  It is noted there were two previous  adjournment  applications
         for the Respondent to disclose the basis of the previous  grant  of
         leave dated 24th June 2015.

         11.  Whilst the Respondent has not had sight to the contents of the
         FtTJ's record of proceedings in the IAC file, it is noted from  the
         attendance  note  of  Ms  A  Brown,  a  HOPO  who  represented  the
         Respondent before the FtT(IAC) that: -

             "Prelims: Rep went through chronology,  argued  no  change  as
             above. I read it differently. At time of grant  she  was  just
             finished chemotherapy and under a period of close review which
             is not reflected in current situation. Referred to file minute
             which was disclosed following last time at Court. It  was  the
             combination  of  cancer  and  HIV.  Now  she  is  said  to  be
             discharged from the oncology clinic after "full remission".

             Much  discussion  followed,   Rep   arguing   no   change   in
             circumstances but there was a  lack  of  medical  evidence  to
             support this. He then wanted to seek an adjournment  on  basis
             that Court should have before them the medical  letters  which
             were before the decision maker when DL was granted.

             He agreed to call I sols to see if they had the same. I looked
             through all files and saw and copied relevant letters;-

             .    4/1/19 from Pam Jennings

             .    Sols dated 16/11/18

             .    Respondent letter dated 2/11/18

             .    NHS W'hampton dated 30/11/17 from 1/6/17 referred  to  in
                  Instructing sols letter

             .    12/7/13 from Dr Latunji

             .    8/4/14 from Dr A MacWhannell

             .    7/4/14 from Dr Joseph McClean

             These are put together as a respondent supp bundle on file.

             IJ then refused adjournment request  and  said  hearing  could
             continue.  He  considered  that  there   was   a   change   in
             circumstances." [my emphasis]

         12.  Accordingly, and to this limited extent only, it  is  accepted
         that the FtTJ failed to record the adjournment application and  his
         subsequent refusal of such application in the decision."

 3. He concludes at [14-16] as follows:

         "14. Given the concession above, it is submitted  that  it  is  not
         necessary to consider the Appellant's second ground of appeal at ï¿½9-
         12.

         CONCLUSION

         15.  For these reasons the UT(IAC) is  invited  to  set  aside  the
         decision of the FtT(IAC) dated 10th September 2019.

         16.  The Respondent has not been descriptive  as  to  the  disposal
         other than to say that the matter needs to be reheard de novo given
         the fourth Direction to the Directions of 17th June 2020."

 4. In the light of the position adopted by the  Secretary  of  State  and,
    having  considered  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   very
    carefully, I find that agree with the respondent that the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal is flawed by legal error for the reasons  which
    she gives. Accordingly, I set aside  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. As the error in this instance touched upon  the  fairness  of
    the appeal process, I return the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal  for
    a hearing de novo and for the decision to be remade.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside. None of  the  findings
of fact shall stand. The appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal  (not
First-tier Tribunal Judge French) for that Tribunal to remake  the  decision
following a hearing de novo.


Signed                              Date 2 July 2020
