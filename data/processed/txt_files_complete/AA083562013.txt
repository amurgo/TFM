Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. A Eaton, Counsel
For the Respondent:     Mr. G Saunders, HOPO


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe, born on 27 November 1982.  She
    entered the UK on 20 February 2011, on her own passport, and was
    granted leave to remain as a visitor until 15 June 2011.  She claimed
    asylum on 4 June 2013.
2.   On 12 July 2013 the respondent refused to grant the appellant asylum
    and, on the same day, a decision was made to refuse her leave to remain
    in the UK and notifying her that she was liable to removal having
    overstayed her granted period of leave in the UK.  On 24 July 2013 the
    appellant lodged a notice of appeal against the respondent's decision.
    Her appeal was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge Fletcher-Hill.

3.   I find that the judge erred in law for the reasons set out in the
    grant of permission.  The reasons are that the judge did not give
    adequate reasons for her adverse credibility findings, accepting and
    concurring with the views of the Secretary of State without explaining
    why she was rejecting the evidence presented by the appellant and her
    witnesses.

4.   The judge's decision cannot stand.  It is set aside in order to be
    remade.  None of the findings made by the judge shall stand.

Directions

5.   The appellant's appeal is to be reheard at Hatton Cross on 6 May 2014
    by a First-tier Judge other than FtTJ Fletcher-Hill.
