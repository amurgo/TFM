Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms E Savage, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Ms K Reid, instructed by Indra Sebastian Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondents are citizens of Sri Lanka  whose  dates  of  birth  are
    recorded as 1 October 1984 and 17 May 1988.  They are husband and wife.
     The Second Respondent's case is entirely dependent upon  that  of  the
    First Respondent.  Together they first entered the United Kingdom on 13
    August 2012 with the First Respondent as a Tier  4  (General)  Student.
    His visa was valid until 28 June 2014.  The First Respondent  was  able
    successfully to apply for the position of Human Resources Manager at  a
    hotel  and  so  made  application  on  26  June  2014  for  a  combined
    application for further leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier
    2 (General) Migrant for a Biometric Residence Permit.   His  wife  made
    application at the same time  as  a  dependent.   On  23  July  2014  a
    decision was made to  refuse  the  applications.   The  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship submitted in accordance with paragraph 77A to Appendix A to
    the  Immigration  Rules  stated  that  the  proposed  employment  would
    commence on 25 June 2014  with  a  finishing  date  of  24  June  2019.
    Because the employment would take the First Respondent's total stay  in
    the United Kingdom as a Tier 2 Migrant over three years and  one  month
    his salary was said to  be  such  that  it  would  be  subject  to  the
    experienced worker appropriate salary  rate.   The  minimum  acceptable
    rate of pay for a 40 hour working week for the  prospective  employment
    was �31,900 per annum having regard  to  the  occupation  code  applied
    under Appendix J to the Immigration Rules but  as  the  Certificate  of
    Sponsorship spoke of a salary of �22,200 per annum for a 39  hour  week
    the requirements of the rule were not met.

 2. The Respondents appealed and on 11 November  2014  their  appeals  were
    heard by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Chohan sitting at Birmingham.
     Judge Chohan accepted Ms Reid's submissions that there was nothing  in
    the Immigration Rules to suggest an  applicant  could  not  be  granted
    leave to remain for three years or more if a new entrant.  There was in
    Ms Reid's submission to Judge Chohan  ample  evidence  that  the  First
    Respondent was  a  new  entrant  and  a  graduate  and  that  in  those
    circumstances the Secretary of State should have  granted  a  visa  for
    three years and one month.  The significance of  three  years  and  one
    month arises because of the provisions of Paragraph 14 to  Appendix  J.
    That provides:

         "14) Where these rules state that an applicant  must  be  paid  the
             appropriate rate for a job as set out in  this  appendix,  the
             rate will be determined as follows:

             ...

             d)   Where both "New Entrant" and "Experienced  Worker"  rates
                 are stated, in tables 1-5, the "New Entrant" rate will only
                 apply if the applicant:

                 ...

                 iv)   was under the age of 26 on the date  the  application
                    was made, and is not applying for a grant of leave  that
                    would extent his total stay in Tier 2 and/or as  a  Work
                    Permit Holder beyond three years and one month.

                 The "experienced worker"  rate  will  apply  in  all  other
                 cases."

 3. Judge Chohan found the issue to be  a  narrow  one  "i.e.  whether  the
    [First Respondent] when he made his application, was a new  entrant  or
    an experienced worker and whether his salary fell within  the  required
    limits."  The judge found that although the evidence pointed to a  post
    being offered to the First Respondent for a period of five years it was
    not incumbent on the Secretary of State to grant a visa for a five year
    period.  It was open to the Secretary of State simply to have granted a
    visa for three years and one month so as to bring the First  Respondent
    and indeed then the Second Respondent  within  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The judge noted that the letter from the hotel which  was  produced  at
    the hearing, but not it would seem in the application itself,  made  it
    clear that, "If he is only able to get three  years  visa  I  am  still
    happy to offer him the job."

 4. There is no issue that the code, 1135 was the appropriate code and were
    it the case that the First Respondent were entitled to succeed as a new
    entrant he met the minimum  earning  requirement  being  in  excess  of
    �22,200.

 5. Not content with the decision  of  Judge  Chohan,  by  Notice  dated  1
    December 2014 made application for permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal on the basis that as the application was for a grant of  leave
    that would extend the First Respondent's total stay in  Tier  2  beyond
    three years and one month it was not open to the judge to  find  as  he
    did.  On 21 January 2015  Judge  Holmes  granted  permission  thus  the
    matter comes before me.

 6. The arguments which were advanced before the First-tier  Tribunal  were
    rehearsed.  The Certificate of Sponsorship  clearly  states  under  the
    hearing, "Work or Study Details," "start date: 25 June 2014,  end  date
    24 June 2019".  The Certificate of Sponsorship  which  is  a  mandatory
    requirement given the wording of 77A which states: "In order to  obtain
    points for a Certificate of Sponsorship, the applicant must  provide  a
    valid Certificate of Sponsorship reference number and such  is  clearly
    part of the application given the remaining provisions of Paragraph 77.
     It is clear that it forms part of the application  because  the  rules
    make provision for no points being awarded if after checks  being  made
    certain requirements are not met.  Here it is perfectly clear that  the
    information provided to the Secretary of State was for a period of five
    years.

 7. The effect of Ms Reid's submission  is  essentially  to  say  that  the
    Secretary of State should have cured the defect in the application.  Ms
    Reid simply submits that the Secretary of State should have provided  a
    visa for that shorter period.  The difficulty with  that  is  that  the
    Secretary of State could  not  have  known  when  making  her  decision
    whether the job would have been available to  the  applicant  for  that
    shorter period and in any event the wording in  Appendix  J  is  clear,
    "and is not applying for a grant of leave that would extend  his  total
    stay..."The First Respondent was applying for that period.  Essentially
    Ms Reid submits that the application should have been amended I  reject
    that submission.  The final part of Paragraph 14(d) in my judgment puts
    the matter beyond doubt when it states: "the (Experienced Worker)" rate
    will apply in all other cases.

 8. Ms Reid submits that that was some unfairness.  However it  is  helpful
    to set out the observations of Sales LJ in EK (Ivory Coast) v Secretary
    of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 1517 at paragraph 28:

         "The Points Based System is intended to simplify the procedure  for
         applying for leave to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  in
         certain classes of case, such as economic  migrants  and  students.
         This is to enable the Secretary of State to process high volumes of
         applications in a fair and reasonably expeditious manner, according
         to clear objective criteria.  This  is  in  the  interests  of  all
         applicants.  It is also assists applicants to  know  what  evidence
         they have to submit in support of an application."

 9. In all the circumstances I find that there was a material error or  law
    and that in remaking  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    appeals and each of them are dismissed.  Whether the Respondents to the
    Upper Tribunal can make a fresh application to the Secretary  of  State
    on a basis which is open to them will be a matter for their advisors.

Notice of Decision

The Secretary of States appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  is  allowed.   The
decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside.   The  decision  of  the
First-tier Tribunal  is  remade  and  the  appeals  and  each  of  them  are
dismissed.
