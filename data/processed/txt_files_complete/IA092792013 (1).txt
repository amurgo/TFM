Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Diwncyz, a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Not present or represented


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent, Sandeep Manarjan, was born 28 October  1990  and  is  a
    citizen of Nepal.  I shall hereafter refer to the  respondent  as  "the
    appellant" as  he  was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and  to  the
    appellant as "the respondent".  The appellant appealed  to  the  First-
    tier Tribunal against a decision to refuse him further leave to  remain
    as a student (Tier 4).  That refusal was issued on 8 March 2013 and the
    First-tier Tribunal, in a determination promulgated on 13 August  2013,
    dismissed the appeal under the Immigration Rules but allowed the appeal
    on Article 8 ECHR grounds.  The Secretary of State  now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. I was satisfied that the appellant had been served with a copy  of  the
    notice of hearing by first-class post on 7 October  2013  at  his  last
    known address in Sheffield.  There was nothing on the file to  indicate
    that  that  notice  of  hearing  had  failed  to  reach  him.   In  the
    circumstances, I proceeded to hear the appeal in  the  absence  of  the
    appellant/any representative.

 3. The judge had not been satisfied that  the  appellant  could  meet  the
    maintenance requirements of paragraph 245 of HC 395 (as amended).   The
    appellant had completed an HND diploma in business and applied  for  an
    extension of his visa to study for a BSc in finance and  accounting  at
    Anglia Ruskin University.  He  had  paid  the  tuition  fees  totalling
    ï¿½5,750.  The judge noted that the appellant's "argument" under  Article
    8 ECHR concerned his private, rather than his family life in the United
    Kingdom.  He noted that, were the  appellant  compelled  to  return  to
    Nepal in order to make his application, he would "have wasted  a  year,
    at the very least" [26].  At [27] the judge wrote:

         "In the circumstances I am satisfied that the consequences  of  the
         decision are sufficient interference with the right to respect  for
         private life that  Article  8  is  engaged  (sic).   I  accept  the
         interference is in accordance with the law, the Immigration  Rules.
         I do not however accept that the decision has the legitimate aim of
         maintaining the economic  wellbeing  of  the  country  by  sensible
         immigration control.  The appellant has been here  for  four  years
         and there was no suggestion that he has ever relied in any way upon
         the state.  He has been funded by her family (sic)  throughout  and
         has expended a substantial amount of money in university  fees  and
         in providing for his maintenance and accommodation.  I am satisfied
         on the evidence that is before me that his family are  willing  and
         able to continue to fund him in the same way as before.  He has not
         been, and is unlikely to be, a burden on the  state.   Indeed,  the
         opposite is true; he  has  invested  heavily  in  the  UK.   If  he
         returned to Nepal now  he  would  inevitably  waste  a  year  going
         through the process of applying for a visa to allow him to return."

 4. The judge then went on at [28], to conclude:

         "If I am wrong about that  then,  for  the  reasons  given  in  the
         preceding paragraph, I do not accept that it  is  proportionate  to
         remove the appellant from the UK in the circumstances."

 5. At [25], the judge referred to the familiar passage  in  Razgar  [2004]
    UKHL 27 at [17]:

         "CNL to insert paragraph 17 of Razgar."







 6. I consider that the judge has misunderstood the questions posed by  the
    House of Lords in Razgar.  It appears that he has answered question (4)
    in the negative  concluding  that  interference  with  the  appellant's
    private life which was in accordance with the law is not necessary  for
    the economic wellbeing of the United Kingdom as provided for by Article
    8(2).  He should have answered that question in the affirmative because
    it is clearly necessary for the public authority to interfere  with  an
    individual's private life for one of the  reasons  stated  in  question
    (4).   The  judge's  observation  at  [27]  goes  to  the  question  of
    proportionality, not to the  necessity  of  a  public  authority  being
    required by an Article 8(2) reason to interfere with private or  family
    life.

 7. It appears that the judge himself may have had misgivings regarding his
    approach at [27] because, as I have recorded above, he went on to  find
    in the alternative that the decision would not be  proportionate.   His
    misunderstanding of the questions posed  in  Razgar  is,  perhaps,  not
    material as a consequence but I find that I agree with the Secretary of
    State that the judge has failed to give any or adequate reasons at [28]
    for finding  that  the  decision  to  remove  the  appellant  would  be
    disproportionate.  He has dealt in some detail with the problems  which
    the appellant would face if he were required to return to Nepal to make
    an out-of-country application but  he  has  attached  little,  if  any,
    weight to  the  public  interest  concerned  with  his  removal.   This
    appellant has failed to show that he satisfies the Immigration Rules as
    regards   his   continued   maintenance   in   the   United    Kingdom.
    Notwithstanding that fact, the judge has accepted  that  he  would  not
    become a financial burden upon the state.  The judge  has  simply  used
    Article 8  to  enable  the  appellant  to  circumvent  the  maintenance
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   He  has  failed  to  have  any
    regard to the public interest concerning the removal of those who  fail
    to satisfy the Rules.  Further, as the respondent noted in the  grounds
    of appeal, he has failed to have regard to the principles  set  out  in
    the Tribunal  decision  of  MM  (Zimbabwe)  [2009]  UKAIT  00037.   The
    Tribunal found in that case, "the character of an individual's 'private
    life' relied upon is ordinarily by its very nature of a type which  can
    be formed elsewhere albeit through  different  social  ties  after  the
    individual is removed from the UK".  The judge has not  considered  the
    possibility of the appellant pursuing his education outside the  United
    Kingdom; there is nothing so compelling regarding the circumstances  of
    this appellant that required him to remain in  the  United  Kingdom  to
    complete his studies.  Further, the appellant can have  had  no  proper
    expectation that he would be allowed to remain in the United Kingdom if
    he  failed  to  meet  the  Immigration  Rules.    Set   against   those
    considerations, there  lies  the  public  interest  in  maintaining  an
    effective system of immigration control.  The impression given  by  the
    judge's determination is that he felt sorry for an  appellant  who  had
    failed to satisfy the unnecessarily detailed and technical requirements
    of the points-based system.   Article  8  should  not  be  used  as  an
    expedient remedy in such circumstances.  Where the public  interest  is
    not  a  fixity,  I  can  identify  no  aspects   of   the   appellant's
    circumstances which indicates that it should be trumped in the  Article
    8 ECHR analysis.

 8. It follows from what I have said that the judge's determination  should
    be set aside.  I have remade the decision.   The  appeal  is  dismissed
    under the Immigration Rules.  The appeal is dismissed on  human  rights
    grounds (Article 8 ECHR).
