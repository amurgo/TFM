Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   No appearance

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant in this appeal is the Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department and to avoid  confusion,  I  shall  refer  to  her  as  "the
    claimant".  The respondents are all citizens of Sri Lanka and were born
    respectively on 18th March 1975, 25th September 1967, 7th January  1996
    and 7th March 1994.  They made application for leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom.

2.   On 21st June 2013 the claimant  refused  to  vary  leave  to  enter  or
    remain.  The respondents appealed that decision and  their  appeal  was
    heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge Jacob Jones at Hatton Cross on  31st
    January 2014.  The main respondent arrived with her  dependent  husband
    and two children in the United Kingdom with entry clearance as a Tier 4
    Student on 14th September 2009 and  they  were  all  granted  leave  to
    remain until 31st August 2010.

3.   The first  named  respondent  completed  her  certificate  in  business
    management at the London College of Business Management and she and the
    other respondents were granted further leave to remain until 9th  April
    2013.  She stated that she had enrolled to complete an ACCA course, but
    the London College of Business Management was closed down around  April
    2012.  The first named respondent claimed that she was unable to find a
    suitable replacement course and she and her family lodged  applications
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom  on  31st  July  2012,  on  a
    compassionate  basis.   The  claimant  was  not  satisfied   that   the
    respondents qualified for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on  the
    basis of their family life as the first named respondent's husband  was
    not British nor settled in the United Kingdom  nor  did  he  have  sole
    parental responsibility for any of the children who were British or who
    were settled in  the  United  Kingdom.   The  claimant  considered  the
    appellants' applications on the basis of  their  private  life  in  the
    United Kingdom but found that they did not  meet  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM.

4.   In his determination, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  noted  that  the
    first named respondent had made a choice to uproot  her  children  from
    Sri Lanka and bring them to the  United  Kingdom  whilst  intending  to
    obtain an ACCA qualification.  He  took  into  account  documents  from
    friends, sports coaches, and from a priest known to the claimant family
    and said this:

         "The [respondents] knew that their stay was dependent upon the main
         claimants' status.  I recognise that Sathma and  Shenal  are  still
         relatively young  and  naï¿½ve  and  I  have  recommended  under  the
         circumstances that the family be allowed to remain  in  the  United
         Kingdom until June 2014 to allow Sathma and Shenal time  to  finish
         this stage of their education.  But after that I  am  of  the  view
         that any removal of the  [respondents]  would  be  a  proportionate
         response to the government's aim of  marinating  a  fair  and  firm
         immigration policy in the UK. This is  particularly  so  where  the
         family have maintained strong ties to Sri Lanka where they built up
         resources to come to the UK to pursue an  education  in  the  first
         place."

5.   The judge went on to purport to allow the respondents' appeals to  that
    extent.  The claimant,  dissatisfied  with  the  decision,  sought  and
    challenged it on the basis that the judge had failed  to  consider  the
    Immigration Rules and consider whether or not there were  good  grounds
    for granting leave outside them, as per Gulshan (Article 8 - new  Rules
    - correct approach) [2013] UKUT  00640  (IAC)  and  Nagre,  R  (on  the
    application of) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2013]
    EWHC 720 (Admin).  To allow the appeal in the way in  which  the  judge
    did was, it was suggested, an error of law.

6.   At the hearing before me on 14th April, 2014, I found  that  the  judge
    had erred by failing to properly apply the  Immigration  Rules  and  by
    making a recommendation in the terms in which he did.  Either the judge
    should have allowed the appeal or he should  have  dismissed  it.   The
    matter was listed for hearing before me at 2 o'clock today, 18th  July.
    Prior to the hearing  the  respondents'  solicitors  had  purported  to
    withdraw the respondents' appeal.  It was  pointed  to  the  claimants'
    solicitors that this was not the respondent's appeal but the claimant's
    appeal and it was not for their client to withdraw.

7.   In writing to the Tribunal the respondents' solicitors have enclosed  a
    copy of the authority signed by Nirosha Reid in which she says that she
    gives the fullest consent to Carmelite Solicitors to withdraw the court
    case which will be heard on 18th July.

8.   There was no appearance by or on behalf of the respondents at 3.0  p.m.
    I therefore concluded that I should proceed with  the  hearing  of  the
    appeal.

9.   For the claimant Mr Tufan invited me to  allow  the  claimant's  appeal
    and dismiss the respondent's appeal.  I have concluded that the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge  did  err  in  law.   He  failed  to  consider  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules and establish whether or not  the
    respondents met  them.   There  is  no  suggestion  anywhere  that  the
    claimants could  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Rules,  in  fact  at
    paragraph 16 he points out that it was not disputed that they could not
    meet the requirements of R-LTPRP, E-LTPRPT, and EX1 of the  Immigration
    Rules, because none of the  claimants  re  in  a  relationship  with  a
    British citizen or a person who is present and settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

10.  The judge records that the claimant considered the  applications  under
    the provisions  of  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    recorded that Counsel on their  behalf  conceded  that  the  appellants
    could not mete the requirements of the Rules.

11.  The judge failed to apply Gulshan or  Nagre  and  instead  went  on  to
    consider Article 8 jurisprudence.  It was on that basis that he appears
    to have concluded that he was empowered to make a recommendation.   The
    judge was not.  He only had power to either allow the appeal or dismiss
    it and having found that the appellants did not meet  the  requirements
    of the Immigration Rules, he should have dismissed it.

12.  The  days  of  Immigration  Judges  making  recommendations  have  long
    passed.  I allow the claimant's appeal.  The respondent's  appeals  are
    dismissed.
