Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Trademan Moyo (the Sponsor)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal by the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO). However, for  the
   purposes of this decision, I shall refer to the ECO as the respondent and
   Mrs Sithole as the appellant, reflecting their positions as they were  in
   the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal.

2. The appellant is a citizen  of  Zimbabwe,  born  on  23  June  1963.  She
   applied for entry clearance to the United  Kingdom  to  settle  with  her
   spouse, Mr Trademan Moyo. Her application was refused on 26 June 2012  on
   the grounds that she did not fall within any of the exemption  categories
   in paragraph 281(i)(a)(ii) to (vi)  and  was  thus  required  to  provide
   evidence to demonstrate that she had completed a test  with  an  approved
   provider, which she had failed to do. Her application was also refused on
   the grounds that she had not demonstrated that her sponsor  had  adequate
   funds for her accommodation and maintenance in the United Kingdom.

3. When reviewing the appellant's application in the light of her notice  of
   appeal, the Entry Clearance Manager noted, in a decision dated 5 December
   2012, that she had provided her registration form for an English language
   test on 18 July 2012 but had not produced the test results. The  decision
   to  refuse  entry  clearance  was  maintained  on  the  same  grounds  as
   previously.

4. The appellant's appeal was heard on  19  March  2013  in  the  First-tier
   Tribunal by Judge  Colvin.  Judge  Colvin  heard  from  the  sponsor,  Mr
   Trademan Moyo, who explained that he had met the appellant in Zimbabwe in
   1994 whilst he was the headmaster of a  school  where  she  worked  as  a
   teacher and had a relationship with her, although he was married  at  the
   time. He divorced his  first  wife  about  two  years  ago.  He  and  the
   appellant had a child together, a daughter, born  in  Zimbabwe,  who  was
   currently eleven years of age. They were married on 31 March 2012.  Their
   daughter was a British citizen and had been in  the  United  Kingdom  for
   five to six years. She lived with him. He had come to the United  Kingdom
   in 2002 and was granted asylum here.  The  appellant  was  a  teacher  of
   geography and English in South Africa. The appellant and  their  daughter
   were imprisoned in Zimbabwe and subsequently went to South Africa but the
   appellant sent her back to the sponsor's sister  in  Zimbabwe  until  the
   sponsor could make an application to bring her  to  the  United  Kingdom.
   They had both believed that she could do the English language test in the
   United Kingdom. He had been a health care worker since  2004  and  earned
   around ï¿½2000 net a month. He had been sending money to the appellant.

5. With the documentary evidence  produced  for  the  appeal  the  appellant
   submitted her TOEIC English test results which she had completed in  July
   2012. In her decision, Judge Colvin commented that it was not  known  why
   the ECM did not have the appellant's English language test results at the
   time of the review in December 2012. She  found  that  the  test  results
   should nevertheless be allowed as evidence to meet  the  requirements  of
   the rules.  She  also  found  that  the  appellant  would  be  adequately
   maintained by the sponsor. The judge acknowledged that she was  accepting
   post-decision evidence, but she considered that nothing would  be  gained
   by requiring the appellant to make a fresh application when she was  able
   clearly to demonstrate that she spoke English to the  required  standard.
   She accordingly allowed the appeal under the immigration rules.

6. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought by  the  respondent
   on the grounds that the judge had wrongly accepted post-decision evidence
   in accepting that the appellant had met the English language  requirement
   of the rules. The test was undertaken in July 2012  whilst  the  decision
   was made on 26 June 2012.

7. Permission was granted on 14 May 2013.

Appeal hearing and submissions

8. The  appeal  came  before  me  on  20  June  2013.  The  sponsor  was  in
   attendance. I heard submissions on the error of law.

9. Mr Tarlow submitted that the judge had clearly erred in law  as  she  had
   taken into account evidence which  was  not  available  at  the  date  of
   decision, contrary to the principles in DR (ECO: post-decision  evidence)
   Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038. She had also failed to consider Article 8  of
   the ECHR.

10. Mr Moyo, in response, apologised for the  delay  and  inconvenience  and
   said that he and his wife were not aware that she  had  to  do  the  test
   before coming to the United Kingdom, but she had  taken  it  as  soon  as
   possible once she realised that she was required to. He referred  to  the
   receipt in the documents submitted confirming that the results  had  been
   sent to the UKBA and the Tribunal prior to the date of the ECM review.

11. I decided that the judge had clearly erred in  law  by  accepting  post-
   decision evidence, which could  not  be  said  to  have  been  reasonably
   foreseeable at the time of the decision, in finding  that  the  appellant
   could meet the requirement of the immigration rules. The English language
   test was taken after the decision to refuse her entry clearance  and,  as
   such, she could not meet the requirements of the rules.

12. Mr Tarlow then asked the  sponsor  some  questions  with  a  view  to  a
   decision being made in regard to Article 8. Mr Moyo gave details  of  his
   employment and salary and confirmed that he lived with his  daughter  and
   that his wife was working as a teacher in South Africa. He explained that
   his wife and daughter were both in prison at one  time  in  Zimbabwe  and
   after their release they went to South Africa. Life  was  very  difficult
   for them there and his wife sent his daughter back  to  Zimbabwe  to  his
   sister and from there he had managed to bring her here under  the  family
   reunion provisions. He could not bring his wife at that time  because  he
   had to establish himself here first and be in a position to support her.

13. Mr Tarlow, in his submissions, simply relied on the refusal  letter  and
   said that he had nothing to  add.  Whilst  he  made  no  concessions,  he
   indicated that he would have no objection to the appeal being allowed  on
   Article 8 grounds, given the specific and  exceptional  circumstances  in
   the appellant's case.

14. I accordingly allowed the appeal on Article 8 grounds.

Findings

15. As already stated, the appellant cannot succeed  under  the  immigration
   rules, given that she took the English language  test  and  received  the
   results after the decision to refuse her entry clearance. Her  appeal  is
   therefore dismissed under the immigration rules.

16. However, as regards Article 8, there clearly  was  family  life  between
   the appellant and the sponsor and their  daughter  at  the  time  of  the
   refusal of entry clearance. The decision interfered with the  development
   of that family life and Article 8 was  thus  engaged.  Whilst  the  entry
   clearance decision was in accordance with the law and  in  pursuit  of  a
   legitimate aim, I consider that the  interference  with  the  appellant's
   family life is and was disproportionate. It is indeed the case  that  the
   appellant could not meet the requirements of the rules and  that  it  was
   and remains open to her to make a fresh application. However, there  are,
   I  find,  specific  circumstances  in  this  case   which,   when   taken
   cumulatively, lead me to conclude that it would simply be unreasonable to
   expect her to have to do so and to  deny  her  entry  clearance  on  this
   occasion.

17. It is not now in dispute, and I accept,  that  the  appellant  would  be
   adequately accommodated and maintained  in  the  United  Kingdom  by  the
   sponsor. The only reason why she could not meet the requirements  of  the
   rules was the failure to meet the English language requirements by taking
   a test. I take account of the fact that she is  an  English  teacher  and
   would thus reasonably be presumed to have been proficient in the  English
   language at the date of the decision. Although her failure  to  undertake
   the appropriate English language test prior to the decision could not  be
   blamed upon any other party, it seems that there was  a  misunderstanding
   on her part as to whether or not she was exempt (see page E14)  and  when
   she needed to take the test. She took the test as soon as possible  after
   finding out and gained the required level. There is evidence, in the form
   of post office receipts, that the test certificate was sent to  the  UKBA
   in August 2012, but it seems that they did not reach  the  ECM  for  some
   reason. Had they done so, they may well have led the ECM to  approve  the
   application in the review in December 2012, given the specific  reference
   therein to the absence of test results.

18. In addition, I take account of the fact that  the  appellant's  daughter
   is a young girl who clearly is at an age when she  needs  a  mother  with
   whom to discuss personal issues. That  is  evident  from  her  letter  at
   Appendix 3E. It is also relevant to note that the family  were  separated
   through the political situation in Zimbabwe, in  which  both  mother  and
   daughter were imprisoned, and not through any choice of  their  own.  The
   sponsor applied for the appellant to join him as soon as he was able  to,
   shortly after their marriage, which followed his divorce from  his  first
   wife. They have now been living apart for some time.

19. Taking all of the above into consideration, it seems to me that, in  the
   unusual and rather exceptional circumstances of this case,  the  decision
   to refuse the appellant entry clearance to join her husband and  daughter
   cannot be justified  in  the  interest  of  immigration  control  and  is
   disproportionate. I find the decision to be in breach of Article 8 of the
   ECHR.

DECISION

20. The making of the decision  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  the
   making of an error on a point of law. The decision has been set aside and
   to that extent the appeal made by the  ECO  is  allowed.  I  re-make  the
   decision and substitute a  decision  dismissing  the  appellant's  appeal
   under the immigration rules but allowing it on Article 8 grounds.

21. The appeal is allowed on Article 8 human rights grounds.
