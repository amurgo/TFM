For the Appellant:     Ms E Martin, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    In person


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State but I will refer  to  the
      original appellant, a citizen of China born on 12  October,  1998,  as
      the appellant herein.

   2. The appellant arrived in the United Kingdom as a student on  27  July,
      2009 and was granted leave to remain until 30  October,  2012.  On  26
      October, 2012 he applied for further leave to remain as a student  but
      this application was refused on 11 February, 2013. The refusal was  on
      maintenance grounds. The appellant needed to show that  he  had  �1600
      for a 28 day period between 28 September, 2012 and 25  October,  2012.
      The Secretary of State noted that between 8 and 10 October,  2012  the
      sums had fallen below that figure - to between �1540-06 and  �1599-06.
      The Secretary of State also noted that the information was provided on
      a printout bank statement which was not in the appropriate format.

   3. The appellant appealed and his appeal came before a  First-tier  Judge
      on 15 April, 2013. The appeal was determined  on  the  papers  as  the
      appellant had not elected an oral hearing. The judge noted that in his
      grounds of appeal the appellant had said when  he  had  submitted  his
      application  he  had  made  a  mistake  by  only  providing  one  bank
      statement. He had two bank accounts, one being a savings account,  the
      other being a  current  account.  He  had  submitted  a  further  bank
      statement with his appeal from Lloyds TSB covering the relevant dates.
      In between those dates the appellant's savings were  never  less  than
      �5000 and on that basis the judge was satisfied that the appellant had
      sufficient maintenance available. She allowed his  appeal  considering
      that she was able to take the evidence at the hearing into account  as
      the appeal was an in country appeal.

   4. The Secretary  of  State  appealed  relying  on  section  85A  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act, 2002  -the  evidence  in  the
      savings account needed to have been given to the respondent before the
      application was decided. Permission to appeal was granted  on  10  May
      2013, reference being made to Alam [2012] EWCA Civ 960.

   5. Ms Martin submitted that the new  evidence  was  not  admissible.  The
      appellant had made a mistake in only lodging one bank statement. There
      was no indication in the application that any evidence had been missed
      bringing into play  a  flexibility  policy.  It  was  clear  what  was
      required. Ms Martin relied on Alam and Miah [2012] on  the  near  miss
      argument. The points based system put a premium on predictability  and
      certainty at the expense  of  discretion-see  paragraph  35  of  Alam.
      Article 8 had not been relied upon.

   6. The appellant told me that he was in the  third  year  of  studies  in
      international trade and business communications. He acknowledged  that
      he had made two mistakes in his application. He  had  not  had  enough
      cash in his personal account and he had failed to put in  his  savings
      account. He had previously had problems in his studies, getting ill in
      his first year and "messing up some of his subjects".  In  his  second
      year his grandfather had died and he was, as he put it, not in a  good
      mood to study. He had failed two subjects. Now he had standard  marks.
      He had a bankcard which covered both accounts. It was,  he  submitted,
      all one bank account.

   7. At the conclusion of the submissions I reserved my decision. The First-
      tier Judge did not consider the  appeal  within  the  context  of  the
      legislation governing the points-based system and simply treated it as
      an in country appeal.

   8. This is an appeal where the appellant admits he made not one  but  two
      mistakes. He failed to check that the documents submitted did not fall
      below the relevant figure in the 28 day period and he also  failed  to
      put in extracts from the savings account. It may be that  there  is  a
      third error as what was put in was not in the correct format.

   9. All this may seem hard on the appellant but the law  knows  no  "near-
      miss" principle-see paragraph 28 of Rudi [2007] EWCA Civ 1326 cited at
      paragraph 17 of Miah.

  10. The First-tier Judge could only  consider  the  evidence  adduced  "in
      support of, and at the time of making, the application  to  which  the
      immigration decision  related"  under  section  85A  4(a).  The  other
      provisos are not relied upon.

  11. The determination is clearly flawed by a material error  of  law.  The
      appellant's appeal  failed  under  the  points  based  system  as  the
      evidence put forward to the Secretary of State in the application  did
      not meet the maintenance requirements for the relevant 28 day period.

  12. There were no grounds of appeal in relation to Article 8. Although the
      appellant may have built up a private life in  the  United  Kingdom  I
      have been provided with scant information about the depth  or  quality
      of that private life. I note that he has on his own account  had  some
      personal  difficulties  leading  to  some  failures  in  his  academic
      achievements although he now says things are back to normal. He  would
      always have been aware he only had temporary permission to stay in the
      United Kingdom. He acknowledges  that  his  application  failed  as  a
      result of two mistakes. Although the points based system is  technical
      students such as the appellant should  not  be  daunted  by  technical
      problems and would be expected to have the intellectual competence  to
      fill in a  form  and  identify  what  material  should  accompany  it.
      Moreover the appellant has been in the United Kingdom for a number  of
      years.

  13. The appellant could not succeed under the immigration rules  governing
      the respondent's approach to Article 8 and even if I  were  to  assume
      somewhat generously that Article 8 was engaged and  I  considered  the
      steps in Razgar v Secretary of State [2004] UKHL 27  the  respondent's
      decision is not unlawful or disproportionate.

      Appeal of the Secretary of State allowed.

      The decision of the First-tier Judge is reversed.

      The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
