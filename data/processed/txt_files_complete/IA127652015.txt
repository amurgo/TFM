                            DECISION AND REASONS

Anonymity

1.    The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction. I have
    not been asked to make one and see no public policy reason for doing so
    and none is made.


Background

2.    This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    (hereafter "the respondent") against the decision of Judge of the First-
    tier Tribunal Zahed (hereafter "the Judge"). On 24 May 2016  the  Judge
    allowed the  appeal  of  Mrs  Njuguna  (hereafter  "the  claimant"),  a
    national of Kenya, against the decision  of  the  respondent  dated  24
    March 2015 refusing her application for leave to remain  as  a  partner
    pursuant to Appendix FM of the Immigration  Rules,  and  a  concomitant
    decision to remove her from the UK by way of directions  under  section
    47 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The  respondent
    refused the application inter alia on the basis that the  claimant  and
    her partner had not proven  they  were  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship and intended to live together permanently in the  UK  and,
    that the financial requirements of Appendix FM were met  on  the  basis
    that specified documents had not been produced that met fully with  the
    prescriptive requirements of Appendix FM-SE of the Rules.

3.    At the hearing the Judge heard evidence  from  the  claimant  and  her
    partner. The Judge was satisfied given the weight of credible oral  and
    documentary evidence that, the couple were in a genuine and  subsisting
    relationship and intended to live together as such [14]. The Judge then
    turned to deal with the financial requirements and  noted  that  whilst
    there was no dispute about the claimant's income of �15,537, there  was
    an issue in respect of her partner's income and, in particular,  as  to
    whether or not six months of payslips and corresponding bank statements
    had been submitted for the relevant period  from  9  June  2014  to  26
    November 2014. In his omnibus conclusion the Judge stated thus:

         "16. I have looked at the documents and find that the payslips  and
         bank statements marry up and I also note  that  the  appellant  has
         provided her husband's P60 for the tax year to 5 April 2015 showing
         he earned �25835.70.


         17. I find that the appellant meets  the  income  threshold  taking
         into account that her income of just over �15,537 had been accepted
         and I find that her husband's income can be taken into account, and
         thus I find that she meets the 5 year Partner Route under  Appendix
         FM. I tallow (sic) her immigration appeal."

Permission to Appeal

4.    The respondent lodged an application for permission to appeal  arguing
    that the Judge gave inadequate reasons for finding that  the  financial
    criteria were met, and that he did not  engage  with  the  respondent's
    concerns regarding discrepant  documentary  evidence  that  potentially
    undermined the genuineness of the partner's employment.  Permission  to
    appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer on 23  September
    2016.

Decision on Error of Law

5.    There is no challenge to the Judge's finding that the relationship  is
    genuine and subsisting. This appeal thus raises a narrow  issue  as  to
    whether the Judge erred in concluding that the  financial  requirements
    were met. While Mr Harding described the decision in  this  respect  as
    "not ideal", I have no hesitation in concluding that the  decision  did
    involve the making of an error on a point of law.  My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

6.    It was the  claimant's  case  before  the  Judge  that  the  financial
    requirements were met from the joint income of  the  claimant  and  her
    partner. While the Judge noted that the claimant's income was  accepted
    [17], it was short of the �18,600 required under  the  Rules  and  thus
    acceptance of the partner's income was  crucial  to  the  appeal  there
    under. The respondent in her refusal sets out  the  specific  areas  of
    financial information in relation to the partner's income that did  not
    comply with the evidential provisions of Appendix FM-SE of  the  Rules.
    In particular, payslips and  personal  bank  statements  had  not  been
    submitted to show receipt of income covering a  period  of  six  months
    prior to the date of application. There is no dispute that that  period
    was from 9 June 2014 to 26 November 2014.  The  Judge  found  that  the
    payslips and bank statements "marry up" [16], but no reasons whatsoever
    are given to support that conclusion.

7.    It is also difficult to discern how the Judge reached that  conclusion
    when the corresponding bank statement for the payslip dated 9 June  had
    not been produced. Both the Home Office Presenting Officer's minute and
    Counsel's  skeleton  argument  record  that  omission.  The  evidential
    requirements therefore were clearly not met. The Judge  thus  erred  in
    concluding that the partner's income could be  taken  into  account  to
    surpass the financial requirements. While I acknowledge the Judge notes
    the existence of the partner's P60 for the  tax  year  ending  5  April
    2015, that  evidence  does  not  negate  the  requirements  to  produce
    corresponding payslips and bank statements in accordance with  Appendix
    FM-SE. The evidential requirements of the Rules are not simply  matters
    that can be overlooked: SS Congo [2015] EWCA Civ 387.

8.    I am further  satisfied  that  the  Judge  did  not  engage  with  the
    respondent's concerns  regarding  discrepancies  in  the  documentation
    relating  to  the  partner's  employment   casting   doubt   on   their
    authenticity. Those concerns are not recorded  or  dealt  with  in  the
    Judge's decision but were advanced before him: see Presenting Officer's
    minute. I was advised by  Mr  Harding  that  the  concerns  were  first
    canvassed by the Judge who properly drew them to the attention  of  the
    parties. That being so the respondent was entitled to cross-examine the
    partner on the issue(s) and rely  on  the  evidence  elicited.  It  was
    imperative in the circumstances for the Judge to have dealt  with  that
    evidence as it potentially undermined whether  the  financial  criteria
    were in fact met. The Judge's  failure  to  consider  the  respondent's
    submissions on the point is I find a material error of law.

9.    Accordingly, I find that the Judge did err in law in finding that  the
    financial requirement was met, and in thus finding  that  the  claimant
    could qualify for leave to remain under the Rules.



Notice of Decision

10.   The decision involved the making of an error on a point of law and  is
      set aside pursuant to section 12(2)(a) of the  Tribunals,  Courts  and
      Enforcement Act 2007. Owing to the nature of the fact-finding required
      I remit the case for a hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  by  a
      Judge other than Judge Zahed. The Judge's findings of fact in  respect
      of the relationship are preserved.

      No anonymity direction is made.
