                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the Secretary of State's appeal against the decision  of  Judge
    Simpson made following a hearing at Manchester on 20th June 2014.



Background

 2. The claimants are citizens of Pakistan.  The principal claimant arrived
    in the UK as a Tier 4 (General) Student on  24th  September  2009  with
    leave until 31st January 2011.  He  was  subsequently  granted  further
    leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Post-Study) Work Migrant until 4th January
    2013.

 3. On 13th November 2013 he and his wife made a combined  application  for
    leave to remain in the UK  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant  and
    dependant under the points-based system  and  for  biometric  residence
    permits.  They were refused on 28th March 2014.

 4. In order to qualify for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  Migrant  the
    applicant must score 75 points for attributes.  He has to  show,  inter
    alia, that he has access to not less than �50,000.

 5. Under paragraph 41 an applicant will only be considered to have  access
    to funds if they are available to him which  means,  inter  alia,  that
    they are in his own possession.

 6. Paragraph 41-SD(c)(ii)(4) states that the relevant account must be  "in
    the applicant's own name only (or both  names  for  an  entrepreneurial
    team) not in the name of a business or third party."

 7. If a third party is  involved  the  Rules  set  out  various  specified
    documents which must be produced.

 8. The refusal letter states that:

         "As your �50,500 investment funds are held in a joint account  with
         Dr S Ayyoub  the  funds  are  not  in  your  own  possession  only.
         Therefore  evidence  of  third  party  funding  is  required  under
         paragraph 41-SD(d) to demonstrate that you have permission  to  use
         the money held in this joint account to invest in a business in the
         UK."

 9. The underlying facts in this case are not  in  dispute.   The  relevant
    funds were held in a joint account with Dr Ayyoub and the claimant  did
    not provide the specified evidence.

10. The claimant argued successfully before Judge Simpson that banking  law
    was clear and all of the money in a  joint  account  was  available  to
    either account holder in its entirety.  The  judge  concluded  that  in
    terms of satisfying the Secretary of State as to  whether  or  not  the
    funds were available to him and in his own possession the fact that the
    funds were held in a joint account did not prevent him from meeting the
    requirements of the Rules.

The Grounds of Application

11. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal.  The  first  ground
    is a mistake, arguing that the judge  had  incorrectly  considered  the
    Immigration Rules in force as at the date of application rather than as
    at the date of decision but it is accepted that  in  fact  those  Rules
    were one and the same, although they have since changed.

12. Second, it was argued that the judge had  erred  in  finding  that  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules were  met  because  the  claimant
    simply could not meet  them.   Evidence  of  third  party  funding  was
    required to demonstrate that the claimant had  permission  to  use  the
    money held in the joint account to invest in a business in the UK.  The
    letter provided by the claimant was not acceptable because it  did  not
    confirm the amount of money available to the claimant  from  the  third
    party's  funds.   Furthermore  no  third  party  declaration  had  been
    provided nor any declaration from a legal representative  to  establish
    that the letter of permission supplied was  valid  as  specified  under
    paragraph 41-SD(d)(ii) of Appendix A of the Immigration  Rules.   Since
    the claimant had failed to submit the specified evidence  to  establish
    access to the funds the appeal ought to have been dismissed.

Submissions

13. Mr Diwnycz relied on the grounds and  submitted  that  the  Rules  were
    plain on their face.

14. Ms Patel submitted that the bank account was  not  in  the  name  of  a
    business or third party and so evidence of third party  funding  should
    not have been required.  Money in the joint account  was  available  to
    the claimant in its entirety. The claimant did meet the requirements of
    the Rules because the cash in the joint account was in  his  possession
    and the underlying purpose of the Rule was therefore satisfied.

15.  The  judge  was  entitled  to  conclude  that   the   caseworker   had
    misinterpreted paragraph 41-SD(d)  since  neither  the  Rules  nor  the
    guidance specify what documentary evidence is required in the case of a
    joint account. The Immigration  Rules'  silence  as  to  the  situation
    regarding joint accounts was a lacuna in the  law  and  the  caseworker
    ought to have asked for  further  information  under  paragraph  245AA,
    under the evidential flexibility policy as stipulated under the  Rules.
    She pointed out that since this decision was made  the  Rules  have  in
    fact changed to clarify the position so  far  as  joint  accounts  were
    concerned.

16. So far as the specified evidence was concerned  the  claimant  provided
    that evidence at the appeal hearing.

17. Finally, it would be a breach of the claimant's Article 8 rights if  he
    was removed since he was responsible for two very successful businesses
    with six employees and their dependants all of whom would suffer if  he
    was not able to continue to operate here as a successful businessman.

Findings and Conclusions

18. Unfortunately for the claimant the Rules are entirely clear.  Paragraph
    41-SD(c)(ii)(4) states in  terms  that  the  account  must  be  in  the
    applicant's own name only. There is no  ambiguity.  In  this  case  the
    investment funds were held in a joint account.

19. The Rule then goes on to specify particular evidence where third  party
    funding is required.  There is no dispute that the  specified  evidence
    was not produced.

20. In order to succeed in his  appeal  the  claimant  has  to  identify  a
    provision of the Rules under which he could succeed. The  Secretary  of
    State considered two Rules and the claimant  did  not  meet  either  of
    them.

21. Ms Patel argued that third party funding was  not  required  since  the
    terms of the joint bank account are that each has access to  the  whole
    sum, and that Dr Ayyoub should not be considered a third party, but  it
    is difficult to see what else he could properly be described as. He was
    a third party as the joint signatory to the account.

22. Ms  Patel's  second  argument  was  that  in  these  circumstances  the
    Secretary of State had a duty under paragraph 245AA to request  further
    information from the applicant.  However she  could  not  realistically
    point to any part of the Rule which obliges the Secretary of  State  to
    go back to the claimant save to say that this was  a  document  in  the
    wrong format.  It was not a document  in  the  wrong  format.  A  joint
    account and an account in a sole name are different entities. She  also
    referred to paragraph 245DD(j) which says that the Secretary  of  State
    reserves the right to request additional information, but that  is  far
    from establishing a duty to do so in these circumstances.

23. Finally she argued that the decision was a  breach  of  the  claimant's
    Article 8 rights.  This must necessarily be on the basis of the private
    life which he  has  established  whilst  being  in  the  UK  but  under
    paragraphs 117B(4) of the 2014 Immigration Act little weight should  be
    given to a private life established by a person  at  a  time  when  the
    person's immigration status is precarious.  Moreover the  claimant  has
    the opportunity of making an application  to  the  Secretary  of  State
    complying with all of the specified evidence Rules.

24. The claimant was obliged under the Rules to provide all of the evidence
    with his application and may not rely on evidence produced at  a  later
    date.

Decision

25. The original judge erred in law.  Her decision is set aside.  It is re-
    made as follows.  The claimant's appeal is dismissed.

No anonymity direction is made.
