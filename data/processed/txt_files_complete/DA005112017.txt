solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against the decision of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal made on 16 November 2017. That, in turn,  was  a  decision  to
    allow the respondent's appeal against a decision of  the  Secretary  of
    State made on 5 September 2017 to make a deportation order against  him
    pursuant to Regulation 23(6)(b) of the Immigration  (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").




    Background to this appeal

 2. The respondent is a citizen of Romania born on 22  June  1999.  He  has
    lived in the United Kingdom since June 2007 when he travelled here with
    his mother and siblings to join his father who had arrived here and was
    exercising Treaty rights.

 3. Between 4 July 2014 and 9 March 2017, the respondent was  convicted  of
    20 criminal convictions on a total of 14 occasions,  resulting  in  him
    being sentenced to three Detention and Training Orders ("DTO").  Two of
    those were for 4 months; the last was  for  12  months,  imposed  on  9
    February 2017.

 4. On 5 September 2017, the Secretary of State then  made  a  decision  to
    deport the respondent, relying on these convictions. In doing  so,  she
    accepted that he had acquired the right of permanent residence, but did
    not accept that he was entitled to the  enhanced  level  of  protection
    under reg. 27(4) of the EEA Regulations because the continuity  of  his
    residence had been interrupted by the time  he  had  spent  in  custody
    before he had reached 10 years' continuous residence.

 5. On appeal, the First-tier Tribunal accepted the respondent's submission
    that a DTO did not count as imprisonment and,  finding  therefore  that
    there had not been an interruption in continuity of residence,  allowed
    the appeal.

 6. The Secretary of State was granted permission to appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal which, dismissed the appeal on 15  March  2018  dismissed  the
    appeal, but on 4 July2018, granted permission to appeal to the Court of
    Appeal. In the interim, the  respondent  was  sentenced  to  serve  two
    period of 24 months' youth detention.

 7. The appeal then came before the Court of Appeal on 11 June 2019. In its
    decision reported as SSHD v  Viscu  [2019]  EWCA  Civ  1052  the  court
    allowed the respondent's  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal had erred in finding that periods spent in youth  custody  did
    not interrupt continuity of residence. As  is  recorded  at  [35],  the
    Secretary of  State  accepted  that  there  had  not  been  an  overall
    assessment as required by reg 3 (4) (c) of the EEA Regulations and  the
    court [53] remitted the appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  for  "further
    consideration in the light of an overall assessment to be made  by  the
    appellant".

 8. The assessment was, unusually, in the form of a skeleton argument  from
    the respondent dated 15 October 2019 provided  for  a  case  management
    hearing on 31 January 2020.

    Scope of the appeal as set out in the order of the Court of Appeal

 9. The order from the Court of Appeal provides:

         '3.  The case is remitted to the Upper Tribunal for it to decide:


          a)  whether  the  Respondent  is  entitled  to  protection   from
             expulsion under regulation 27(4)(a) of the  Immigration  (EEA)
             Regulations 2A16, by virtue of the matters in regulation  3(a)
             of those Regulations; and


          b) if not, whether the Respondent's deportation is  justified  on
             serious grounds of public policy and public security  for  the
             purposes  of  regulation  27(3)  of  the   Immigration   (EEA)
             Regulations 2016.'


10. For the reasons given by the Court of Appeal, the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal did involve the making of an error of law, and it is  for
    us to remake it.

The Law

11. The Directive provides   - enacted in domestic law in the EEA Regs.

12. The EEA Regulations provide at Reg. 3:

         '(3) Continuity of residence is broken when-


          a) a person serves a sentence of imprisonment;


          b) a deportation or exclusion order is  made  in  relation  to  a
             person; or


          c) a person is  removed  from  the  United  Kingdom  under  these
             Regulations.


         (4)  Paragraph (3)(a) applies, in principle, to an EEA national who
         has resided in the United Kingdom for at least ten  years,  but  it
         does not apply where the Secretary of State considers that-


          a) prior to serving a sentence of imprisonment, the EEA  national
             had forged integrating links with the United Kingdom;


          b) the effect of the sentence of imprisonment was not such as  to
             break those integrating links; and


          c)  taking  into  account  an  overall  assessment  of  the   EEA
             national's situation, it would not  be  appropriate  to  apply
             paragraph (3)(a) to the  assessment  of  that  EEA  national's
             continuity of residence.'


13. The EEA Regulations also provide at reg. 27:

         '27. (1) In this regulation, a "relevant  decision"  means  an  EEA
             decision  taken  on  the  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
             security or public health.


             (2)  A relevant decision may not be taken  to  serve  economic
             ends.


             (3)  A relevant decision may not be  taken  in  respect  of  a
             person with a right of permanent residence under regulation 15
             except on serious grounds of public policy and public security


             (4)  A relevant decision may not be taken except on imperative
             grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-


                  (a)  has resided in the United Kingdom  for  a  continuous
                  period of  at  least  ten  years  prior  to  the  relevant
                  decision; or


                  (b)  is under the age of 18, unless the relevant  decision
                  is in the best  interests  of  the  person  concerned,  as
                  provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the  Child
                  adopted by the General Assembly of the United  Nations  on
                  20th November 1989.


             (5)  The public policy and public security requirements of the
             United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise  conferred
             by these Regulations  in  order  to  protect  the  fundamental
             interests of society, and where a relevant decision  is  taken
             on grounds of public policy or public security it must also be
             taken in accordance with the following principles-


                  (a)  the  decision  must  comply  with  the  principle  of
                  proportionality;


                  (b)   the  decision  must  be  based  exclusively  on  the
                  personal conduct of the person concerned;


                  (c)  the personal conduct of the person must  represent  a
                  genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting
                  one of the fundamental interests of society,  taking  into
                  account past conduct of the person  and  that  the  threat
                  does not need to be imminent;


                  (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case  or
                  which relate to considerations of  general  prevention  do
                  not justify the decision;


                  (e)  a person's previous criminal convictions  do  not  in
                  themselves justify the decision;


                  (f)  the decision may be taken  on  preventative  grounds,
                  even in the absence of  a  previous  criminal  conviction,
                  provided the grounds are specific to the person.


             (6)  Before taking a  relevant  decision  on  the  grounds  of
             public policy and public security  in  relation  to  a  person
             ("P") who is resident in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  decision
             maker must take account of considerations  such  as  the  age,
             state of health, family  and  economic  situation  of  P,  P's
             length of residence in the  United  Kingdom,  P's  social  and
             cultural integration into the United Kingdom and the extent of
             P's links with P's country of origin.


             (7)  ...


             (8)  A court or tribunal considering whether the  requirements
             of this regulation are met must (in particular) have regard to
             the considerations contained in Schedule 1 (considerations  of
             public policy, public security and the  fundamental  interests
             of society etc.).'


14. we consider that the issue of whether the 10 years was met is  and  was
    still live on the basis of which this decision was remitted  to  us  by
    the Court of Appeal.

15. The Secretary of State's case is that the respondent is not entitled to
    enhanced protection under reg 27 (4) as he had not  acquired  10  years
    residence by the date of the decision to deport because of the  periods
    of time spent in detention.  She also submits that even were  that  so,
    the effect of the sentence of imprisonment is to break the  integrative
    links and so he is entitled only to the level  of  protection  provided
    for in reg. 27 (3).

16. The respondent accepts  that  periods  of  imprisonment  interrupt  the
    continuity of residence but submits that they simply "pause" the clock,
    relying on Hafeez v SSHD [2020] EWCA Civ 406.

17. Both parties are, however, agreed that the  overall  assessment  as  to
    whether the integrative links have been broken is an assessment  to  be
    undertaken by the Upper Tribunal as at the date of hearing.  We accept,
    following FV (Italy v SSHD) and B v Land Baden -W�rttemberg  that  this
    is correct.

18. But we do not consider that this alters  the  position  established  in
    SSHD v MG Portugal [2014]1 WLR 2441 that the 10 year period  is  to  be
    assessed from the date of the expulsion decision. We do not accept that
    anything in FV(Italy), B v Land-W�rttemberg or  SSHD  v  Vomero  [2019]
    UKSC 35 alters this and we note that the court was careful at  [70]  to
    refer to the overall assessment being carried out at a  time  at  which
    the question of expulsion arises, not the date of the  decision.  Those
    dates  may  be  separate,  and  we  remind  ourselves  that   Directive
    2004/38/EC expressly provides at article 33.2 that:

         '33.2 If an expulsion order, as provided for  in  paragraph  1,  is
         enforced more than two years after it was issued, the Member  State
         shall  check  that  the  individual  concerned  is  currently   and
         genuinely a threat to public policy or public  security  and  shall
         assess  whether  there  has  been  any  material  change   in   the
         circumstances since the expulsion order was issued'


19. Further, if the CJEU were intending to alter an earlier ruling of  such
    recent vintage, it would have said so. It is  also  clear  from  Vomero
    that the issue was whether, in the interim, the appellant had  acquired
    permanent residence since 2007 and in Hafeez  the  court  proceeded  on
    the basis that it was the date of  the  decision  to  deport  which  is
    relevant  to  the  assessment  of  whether  there  had  been  10  years
    residence.

20. It is only after a period of ten years residence, deducting time  spent
    serving a prison sentence or time spent  in  youth  custody  that,  the
    issue of whether that has broken the integrating links can arise. It is
    not that a conclusion that the links were not broken erases the gaps in
    continuity; the completion of the ten years continuous residence  prior
    to the expulsion decision is a condition precedent to the second  stage
    of the test which is whether the integrative links have been broken,  a
    test carried out by a court at a date different from the  date  of  the
    decision to deport.

21. There are, as the cases establish, two principal questions to be asked:

      a) Did  the  individual  in  question  acquire  10  years'  continuous
         residence prior to the date of the expulsion decision, the 10  year
         period to be calculated omitting time spent in imprisonment?

      b) If so, did those periods  of  imprisonment  break  the  integrative
         links previously forged with the host member state with the  result
         that he is no longer entitled to the enhanced protection?

22. We therefore start our analysis in asking whether  the  respondent  has
    acquired 10 years continuous residence.  In doing so, we have taken  as
    our starting point the chronology provided by  the  respondent  in  his
    bundle.

23. We accept that the respondent arrived in the United Kingdom on 14  June
    2007. We accept also that the decision to make a deportation order  was
    made on 5 September 2017, some 10 years and 85 days later. From his own
    chronology, it is  evident  that  the  respondent  had  by  then  spent
    significant periods youth custody: from 16 June 2015 to 16 August  2015
    (60 days), from 25 February 2015 to 25 April 2016 (58 days) and from  9
    March 2017 to 7 September 2017 (178 days), a total  of  296  days.   On
    that basis, and even not counting the days of entry into and exit  from
    custody, he had not at the date of the date of the  expulsion  decision
    acquired 10 years residence by a margin of 211 days.

24. Even were we to adopt the date of  the  Secretary  of  State's  overall
    assessment set out in Mr Lindsay's skeleton argument, or  the  date  of
    the hearing on 31 January 2020 when that was submitted as the date from
    which the 10 year period was to be reckoned, that does not  assist  the
    respondent as although he was not in custody between 7  September  2017
    and 23 March 2018, that is 196 days so he was at  best  still  15  days
    short of 10 years given that by then he had spent a further  two  years
    and 8 days in custody between 23 February 2018 and 3 March 2020 and was
    in youth custody as at that date.

25. While it may well be that if the date for counting  back  the  10  year
    period were the date of  hearing,  the  respondent  has  aggregated  10
    years, that is not the basis on which that issue is determined.

26. On that basis, it  is  unnecessary  for  us  to  consider  whether  any
    integrative links with this country have been broken.  Nonetheless,  we
    have proceeded to do so, out of an abundance of caution.  We  therefore
    turn to the evidence, including the oral evidence led before us.

27. We accept from the evidence that the respondent arrived in  the  United
    Kingdom at nearly 8 years of age, when he and his siblings  and  mother
    came to live with the father. We accept also, that from the age  of  12
    he was taken into care owing to violence to which he was  subjected  by
    his father. It appears from his witness  statement,  and  the  evidence
    from this social worker, Ms Holmes, that he was  moved  between  foster
    placements and children's homes before moving back  to  live  with  the
    family. We have no reason to doubt that the respondent became alienated
    and struggled at school, finding it  hard  to  fit  and  drifting  into
    associating with older boys and then into abuse of  alcohol  and  drugs
    and associated crime.

28. It was put to the respondent that the real reason his parents had not
    attended was that they no longer supported him.  He denied that.

29. He said that he had not returned to Romania on more than two occasions
    the last being in 2012.  He said he had visited his grandmother who is
    on her own, his grandfather having died before he was born.  He said
    his father has a brother, but he was not in contact with him and
    thought the grandmother was his mother's mother.  He said he had not
    spoken to his grandmother for several years, but his mother might have
    told her of what happened to him.

30. The respondent also said that he could not hold a conversation in
    Romanian and said that he would not be able to pick up the language on
    return.

31. We also heard evidence from Ms Holmes, the appellant's social worker
    for the past five years.  She adopted a letter which she had submitted
    dated 9 July 2020 which is an addition to her letter of 8 November 2017
    which was also before Judge Walker.  It was put to her that her letter
    of 2017 had been optimistic if not overoptimistic as was her current
    letter.  She said this was not so and that for the reason given in the
    letter the appellant had shown progress.  Mr Whitwell submitted that,
    as Mr Lindsay had said in his skeleton argument, as the judge had noted
    in the sentencing remarks of 2017 that there were aggravating factors
    to his offending and that although she had noted encouraging signs the
    appellant had nonetheless gone on to commit even more serious crimes.
    He submitted that the frequency, breadth and escalation of the crimes
    was a worrying factor.  The most recent offences involved possession of
    a blade, heroin with intent to supply and burglary.

32. Mr Whitwell drew attention also to the evaluation of the appellant
    being at high risk and the OASys Report on the last occasion, asking us
    to note also the report from Probation in which it was said that he had
    not complied with the approved premises rules providing COVID
    restrictions and had therefore been recalled, that there had been
    issues with him pushing boundaries.

33. He submitted further with regard to Ms Holmes's letters that the same
    stressors would apply to the appellant as he has no job, lives in the
    same city.

34. Mr Whitwell submitted that the appellant had not shown that he could
    not speak Romanian or could not re-acquire the language quickly.  He is
    said to have spoken it up to the age of 10 and that the evidence about
    the family in Romania was unsatisfactory.

35. Turning to the issue of rehabilitation Mr Whitwell submitted there is
    no evidence to show that there was no equivalent facilities available
    for him in Romania and whilst it was a factor, there was insufficient
    evidence to show that he was engaging with what was on offer in the
    United Kingdom.

36. In response, Mr Briddock submitted that there is a significant
    difference to be drawn between offending as an adult and offending as a
    person under 21 given the express difference in the purposes as set out
    in Section 42 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  He submitted it was
    important to bear in mind that the respondent was a looked after child
    who had been failed by the system.  He submitted we should accept the
    appellant's account of his circumstances with regard to speaking
    Romanian and his family and that, were we not to accept the appellant
    was entitled to enhanced protection, the "serious" threat level had not
    been made out, submitting we were not bound by the conclusions to that
    effect coming from Judge Walker, his just being little more than
    observations and that a fresh analysis of proportionality was required.

37. We start by assessing the respondent's integrative links. In doing so,
    we take into account his links with his family as well as with the
    wider community, education, employment and other links to the United
    Kingdom.

38. We note from judge Walker's decision that the respondent's parents had
    supported him [38] and indeed they gave evidence before Judge Walker.
    The parents have not given evidence before us, the explanation being
    from the respondent in his witness statement that

"my parents also visited me monthly whilst I was in custody and we have
worked hard to rebuild our relationships which are now much better.
Although I am sure they would have come to the Tribunal if I'd asked them,
this time I feel more comfortable setting out how things were without
having them here."


39. Whilst we note references to the parents in the letters from Ms Holmes,
    they are not mentioned in the letter from the Probation Service nor is
    there evidence in the Offender Personality Disorder Pathway team's
    letter to any ongoing contact with the parents.  While Ms Holmes does
    refer to the parents in her most recent letter, her letter of 8
    November 2017, stating:

         "Denis' family visited him regularly whilst in custody and the
         family have worked hard to re-build their relationships. Since
         being released from custody, Denis has enjoyed visits to see his
         family at home."


40. There is no detail in her more recent letter of the respondent's
    relationship with the parents.

41. We note that the respondent's parents have not on this occasion
    attended to give evidence.  We do not accept, viewing the evidence as a
    whole that this because, as the respondent says, he thought we would be
    more comfortable with them.  We have no letter from them indicating
    their continued support.  We conclude that the parents do not wish to
    support him and that there is little connection between them and the
    respondent.

42. We accept, on the other hand, that there can be less tangible links to
    the United Kingdom. In this case, the respondent was educated here for
    between the ages of nearly 8 and 16, formative years. He lived in the
    wider community, albeit one into which he had difficulty integrating
    and he speaks English to the extent that we would not have taken him
    for anything other than a native speaker.

43. The respondent is not employed and has a history of a wide range of
    offences including offences against the person and most recently
    supplying class A drug, possession of a bladed weapon and burglary.

44. We consider that a lack of ties to the country of origin may indicate
    integration into the host member state. While the respondent's evidence
    on this point was vague, and he was not even sure which of his
    grandmothers are still alive, we note the evidence of his parents at
    the previous appeal. It is that there are little or no family ties, and
    they have not been back to Romania more than once, although the
    respondent said twice, his evidence was hesitant on that point and at
    other times appears from correspondence to have mentioned grandparents
    (plural) living in Romania. The evidence of the parents on the previous
    occasion as set out in their witness statements is that they had
    visited Romania only once in the last ten years, in contrast to the
    appellant's evidence that it had been twice.  The mother says little
    other than that there are two grandmothers, her mother being in her
    late 80s and the other being elderly.  This inconsistency causes us
    some concern, but unless we were to reject the parents' evidence
    wholesale, there is a consistency of a lack of contact with Romania or
    relatives there. Given also the chaotic nature of the respondent's
    upbringing from the age of 12, it is hardly surprising that he has lost
    contact with Romania and relatives.

45. Pausing there to take stock, we consider that on the facts of this
    case, were it necessary for us to make the relevant finding, that the
    respondent had formed some integrative links to the United Kingdom.
    These do, however, appear to have broken down as a result of his
    increasingly serious criminal behaviour.

46. In approaching this issue, we bear in mind what Flaux LJ said in this
    case:

         "44. The CJEU jurisprudence to which I have referred establishes
         (i) that the degree of protection against expulsion to which a
         Union national resident in another member state is entitled under
         the Directive is dependent upon the degree of integration of that
         individual in the member state; (ii) that, in general, a custodial
         sentence is indicative of a rejection of societal values and thus
         of a severing of integrative links with the member state but (iii)
         that the extent to which there is such a severing of integrative
         links will depend upon an overall assessment of the individual's
         situation at the time of the expulsion decision."


47. Have those links been broken as at the date of hearing?  We note the
    respondent's evidence that he has, having spent two years in HMP
    Aylesbury and having been put on a six month Kaizen programme, an
    offender behaviour programme for adult males, that he had begun to turn
    his life around identifying a "new me profile" and a "new me life
    plan".  He says [12] that his skills have helped him to manage his life
    better and to make his choices about how he spends time with and does
    not put himself in risky situations.  He also says that he met with a
    clinical psychologist on a weekly basis and this again has improved his
    situation.

48. We are not satisfied on the evidence that the respondent has in reality
    turned a corner.  We note that he was recalled to prison for a period
    of four weeks after breaking COVID restrictions in the place where he
    was living.  We consider that despite Ms Holmes' optimism, and indeed
    the optimism shown by the sentencing judge in 2017, the appellant has
    not, in reality, changed his by now ingrained behavioural traits.
    Whilst he may be vulnerable, as Ms Holmes submits, he has also carried
    out a large number of crimes of increasing severity.

49. We do not underestimate the difficulties he has had as a result of
    being estranged from his family due to domestic violence, difficulties
    in reconciling his family background with the British culture in which
    he was growing up and that this led him, living on a deprived housing
    estate into antisocial behaviour and crime.  But there comes a point
    where, as a young adult, a person from such an upbringing is makes
    choices.  In this case the respondent chose to go on to commit more and
    more serious crimes despite having served time in youth custody and
    despite the warning received from the judge and despite the fact that
    he was facing deportation proceedings.

50. Even had we been persuaded at the date of the hearing before Judge
    Walker, whose findings we note, that the respondent's integrative links
    have not been broken bearing in mind his relatively young age and the
    purpose of youth custody, we consider that the evidence of criminal
    offending which has occurred since then satisfies us that what
    integrative links he had have been broken.

51. That is not a conclusion which we reach with any enthusiasm given the
    abuse from his family and the very serious difficulties the respondent
    has faced following a family breakdown and him being accommodated by
    the local authority.  But the fact remains that the respondent has no
    job, no reasonable prospect of employment, and continues to live in the
    same area as before and where he would, as we accept, be subject to the
    same stressors as in the past.

52. We accept that we are differing in this respect from the position of Ms
    Holmes as set out in her most recent letter but we consider that her
    assessment is overoptimistic and whilst she says that he can now
    identify and implement strategies that help regulate his behaviour and
    make better decisions, it is odd that she makes no mention of him being
    recalled to prison for four weeks at all.  It is difficult to square
    this with the assertion that he shows a high level of commitment to his
    rehabilitation and whereas she refers to the difficulties he would have
    if deported to Romania and that he would have no family support she
    does not state what family support there is at present.

53. Accordingly, for these reasons, taking the evidence as a whole, we do
    not accept that the respondent would on any view be entitled to the
    enhanced protection even had he met the ten year threshold.

54. Turning next to the assessment of whether the respondent presents a
    serious threat, we turn first to the assessments from the Probation
    Service and his current Offender Manager.

55. The Probation Officer, Ms Burden, who had worked with the respondent
    from January 2018 to May 2020 wrote on 9 July 2020:

         "At the time I was working with Denis he was assessed as high risk
         of serious harm to members of the public, this was based on his
         past and current offending behaviour and the impact of that
         behaviour on victims which had the likelihood to cause serious
         harm.


         ...


         He remained assessed as high risk on release from custody as he was
         untested in the community. This was explained to Denis prior to
         release. This would require further assessment from his current
         Probation Officer given he has been in the community for 3 or so
         months and his time within a restrictive environment i.e. Probation
         Approved Premises is due to end.


         That said, it is also noted that he did exceptionally well during
         his Kaizen course and that he had continued to demonstrate high
         levels of compliances but yet, that does not necessarily indicate
         that the evaluation of high risk is incorrect."


56. Turning next to the email from the current offender manager, Ms Boyd,
    of 10 July 2020, we note that the respondent did not comply with the
    Approved Premises rules regarding COVID restrictions and that he was
    then recalled to prison but re-released.  It is also noted that there
    have been issues in him pushing boundaries, but that "this can be
    expected". Why that is so is unclear.  There are positive observations
    that he has engaged in the past and has not caused issues that would
    result his return to prison, equally, it is said that the respondent
    needs to implement the skills he has learned on the Kaizen course more
    successfully, and that it takes him time to build his relationship and
    rapport with agencies involved, this would be jeopardised were he to be
    deported.

57. There is, however, no express detailed assessment of risk or assessment
    that the previous high-risk assessment is no longer valid.

58. As regards rehabilitation, there is a lack of evidence of what would be
    available in Romania. It is, however, likely that the respondent would
    have difficulty in engaging with new agencies, given the evidence to
    that effect from Ms Boyd.

59. We accept it is difficult to assess the threat that the respondent
    poses of committing further crime given the artificiality of the
    situation which he now lives, during the COVID-19 lockdown.  But it is
    worrying that he faced recall to prison for failing to comply with the
    regulations and spent a further four weeks in detention.  We consider
    that his prospects of employment are limited albeit that it is
    difficult for him to get onto relevant courses in the current situation
    but nonetheless, given the respondent's track record and the lack of
    time he has spent outside of detention and given his protestations on
    the previous occasion that he had learnt his lessons, we are not
    satisfied that he has reformed in any meaningful way or that it could
    now be said that he does not present a serious threat of reoffending
    given how he has behaved in the past.  We consider Ms Holmes evidence
    to the contrary to be overly optimistic, as her evidence from 2017 has
    proven to be in the past.

60. We are therefore satisfied that there is a high risk of the respondent
    committing crime again. We consider also that the crimes are likely to
    be of the same seriousness as in the past: possession with intent to
    supply a class A drug, burglary, and assaults.  Given the effect on
    society of drugs, and in particular those in Class A, as well as the
    effects on those assaulted, we are satisfied that the need to prevent
    the scourge of the dealing in illegal drugs and the misery that causes,
    constitutes a serious reason of public policy, and that the respondent
    does represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society.

61. Having reached that conclusion, we now consider whether deportation is
    proportionate. In doing so we must consider the relative prospects of
    rehabilitation, in the sense of ceasing to commit crime, between the
    United Kingdom and Romania. But that is but one factor to be taken into
    account in assessing proportionality and applying regs. 27(5) and (6).

62. What has been presented to us by the respondent  and by Ms Holmes is
    conjecture but we do consider that the evidence from the Probation
    Service shows that it took a considerable time for the various agencies
    to develop a rapport with the respondent in the Kaizen course. That the
    respondent has difficulty in trusting and engaging with others is
    consistent with what happened to him as an adolescent and we would
    expect it to be difficult for him to engage with the authorities in
    Romania.

63. We accept also that the respondent does not speak Romanian well and
    certainly does not appear to have practised it much. We bear in mind
    that the respondent was born in Romania and was raised there until the
    age of nearly 8. He continued to live in a Romanian speaking household
    until around 12, but he then appears to have gone into the care system.
    In that context, he may well no longer be able to speak Romanian,
    certainly at a sophisticated level, but we are not persuaded that  he
    could not rapidly regain his knowledge, albeit that his knowledge of
    the written language is likely to be limited.

64. We are not satisfied by the respondent's evidence that he has no
    relatives in Romania. It would, however, be speculative to consider
    that they would help him.  There is a consistency in the evidence of
    little or no family contact with Romania.

65. The respondent is, we recall, a healthy adult. We bear in mind also
    that the respondent has not lived in Romania since he was just short of
    8 years of age. He is, however, in good health, and appears now to have
    few social ties to the United Kingdom, having spent a significant time
    in detention. As noted above, his integrative links have been broken.
    While he may have difficulty in gaining employment in Romania, we have
    not been taken to any documentary evidence of what would be available
    to him there, or what financial and other support he could expect from
    the state.

66. The respondent has no children in the United Kingdom nor is it
    submitted that he has established a family life here; he has no
    partner, and no longer lives with his parents.

67. We bear in mind also that the respondent represents a genuine, present
    and sufficiently serious threat to the fundamental interests of
    society. He represents a serious risk to society, and significant
    weight must be attached to that. We have found also that the respondent
    has broken the integrative links he had with this country. While we
    attach some weight to the lack of ties he has with the country of
    nationality, and lack of facility in the language, we bear in mind his
    young age, and the finding that he could acquire a better command of
    Romanian. We bear in mind that the respondent has few, if any, economic
    ties to the United Kingdom, and very limited family ties. Some weight
    we do attach to his rehabilitation prospects which are may be less
    likely in Romania, but overall, we find that the Secretary of State has
    satisfied us that his deportation is proportionate in all the
    circumstances, given the seriousness of the risk he presents.

68. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal under the EEA Regulations.

Anonymity

69. We have considered whether it would be in the interests of justice to
    make an anonymity order in this case as requested by Mr Briddock.

70. The starting point is the principle of open justice; Exceptions to that
    rule must be justified by some more important principle, most often
    where the circumstances are such that that openness would put at risk
    the achievement of justice which is the very purpose of the
    proceedings. Here, we are concerned not with a protection claim, and
    much of what we say in this decision is a matter of public record; the
    decision of the Court of Appeal was not anonymised.   While we accept
    that some of what we say relates to the respondent's childhood, we are
    not satisfied, looking at all the appeal as a whole, that the interests
    of justice in this case require anonymity.

Summary of Conclusions

 1. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law and we set it aside.

 2. We remake the appeal by dismissing the appeal on EU grounds.
