Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr R Molyneux, Counsel, instructed by Global
                    Immigration Solutions
For the Respondent:    Miss A Holmes, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals with permission against the decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal dismissing her appeal against a  decision  to  refuse  to
    vary her leave to remain as a spouse  and  to  remove  her  by  way  of
    directions under Section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality
    Act 2006.

Background

 2. The appellant is a citizen of China who came to the United  Kingdom  in
    July 2006 as a student dependent, which was  extended  until  11  April
    2014, with a brief interruption between March and May  2010.  In  March
    2014, she applied to vary her leave to remain as the Tier 4 spouse of a
    person present and settled in the United Kingdom.

 3. The parties met in China and married  there  in  2006  in  Yinxi  Town,
    Fuqing  City,  China.   Both  are  Chinese  native  speakers  and   the
    respondent was not satisfied that there was evidence  that  they  could
    not return and pursue their private  and  family  life  in  China.   No
    evidence of children was produced to the respondent when she  made  her
    decision: the section headed 'dependent children applying with you' was
    crossed out. However, in  her  witness  statement  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing, the appellant  asserted  that  she  had  two  British
    citizen children, a son born on 20 February 2009 and  a  daughter  born
    shortly before the hearing in September 2015.   No  birth  certificates
    or other evidence to support the existence of those children, or  their
    claimed nationality, was before the First-tier Tribunal.

 4. The  income  evidence  was  examined  under  paragraph  284(b)  of  the
    Immigration Rules HC395 (as amended) but rejected because  the  parties
    could show combined earnings of only �5648.42 in the year preceding the
    appellant's application.  On 28 August 2014, the respondent refused  to
    vary the appellant's leave to remain on the  basis  that  she  had  not
    shown income at  the  paragraph  276ADE  level  of  �18600  (there  are
    alternatives involving savings which do not apply  here).   It  appears
    that the sponsor  then  obtained  a  new  job  with  better  pay,  from
    September 2014.

First-tier Tribunal decision

 5. In the decision under challenge the Judge took account of  the  limited
    evidence of the couple's income produced with the original application,
    which he calculated as considerably less than the required income under
    paragraph 276ADE of �18,600 per annum. The Judge considered Appendix FM-
    SE and noted that the specified documents had not been provided,  which
    I do not understand to be in dispute.

 6. The argument now relied on is set out at paragraphs 19  to  20  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision: the appellant contends that by issuing  a
    Section 120 notice the Secretary of State let in her financial evidence
    up to and including the date of hearing.  It appears that  her  sponsor
    now has steady employment in the United Kingdom  and  is  earning  much
    more than he was at the date of decision.

 7. The Judge did not accept that the date  of  hearing  was  the  relevant
    date.  He made his decision on the basis of  the  evidence  before  the
    respondent, which did not approach the level of  �18600.   He  was  not
    satisfied under  paragraph  284(b)  that  the  parties  could  maintain
    themselves adequately without recourse to public funds as  required  by
    paragraph 284(b). At the  date  of  application,  their  income  barely
    covered the monthly rent paid by the appellant and her husband, leaving
    nothing for living expenses.

 8. The undisclosed child  (now  2  children)  would  increase  the  amount
    required, both under the Rules as they stand now, or under the old test
    of adequate maintenance without recourse to public  funds.  The  appeal
    was dismissed.

Grounds of appeal

 9. The challenge in the grounds of appeal is first, that the facts fall to
    be considered under paragraph  284  of  the  Immigration  Rules  rather
    paragraph 276ADE and that therefore the appellant was required only  to
    meet the requirements of paragraph 284(b) of the Immigration  Rules  as
    they  stood  before  the  introduction  of  the  present  scheme.   The
    respondent does not dispute that.

10. The appellant pursues her argument  that  the  husband's  post-decision
    income is admissible, by reason of the serving of a Section 120  notice
    and that the appeal should be allowed because now the  parties'  income
    did meet the income requirements.  Ground 2 repeats that  argument  and
    relies on the decision of the Court of Appeal in  AS  (Afghanistan)  in
    relation to paragraphs 85(2) and 85(5) of the 2002 Act before they were
    amended.

Permission to appeal

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge  McWilliam  on
    the basis that 'if indeed it is the case,  which  seems  to  have  been
    accepted by the Judge, that relevant Rule is 284, it is  arguable  that
    the Judge should have taken  into  account  the  appellant's  husband's
    income when assessing 284(viii)'.  The income referred to was  that  at
    the date of hearing, as the husband now has a steady job and  a  better
    income than at the date of application or decision.

Rule 24 Reply

12. The Secretary of State replied pursuant to Rule 24, accepting that this
    appeal fell to be  treated  under  paragraph  284  of  the  Rules,  not
    paragraph 276ADE.  She contended as follows:

         "2.  ... It is submitted that the grounds in relation  to  Appendix
             FM and Appendix FM-SE of the Immigration Rules have failed  to
             have regard to the provisions of the Rules themselves.  Whilst
             the Judge was entitled to consider  evidence  submitted  after
             the date of the decision, given the wording of the  Rules  the
             evidence for meeting the financial requirements had to  relate
             to a six-month period prior to the application, as  stipulated
             by Appendix FM-SE(2)(a).  Given  the  appellant's  application
             was made on 20th March 2014 any evidence had to be in relation
             to the period September 2013  to  March  2014.   The  evidence
             relied upon by the appellant post-dates this and  Section  85A
             of the NIAA 2002 does not amend  the  requirements  under  the
             Rules.  It is submitted  that  AS  (Afghanistan)  [2013]  UKUT
             00044 is not relevant as  the  appellant's  appeal  is  not  a
             points based appeal. Even if AS [2013] applied to Appendix  FM
             applications it is  noted  that  the  evidence  postdates  the
             decision of the appellant's application.

         3.   With regard to paragraph 284  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  if
             applied properly the appellant is unable to succeed as she  is
             required to meet all elements of paragraph 284.   The  grounds
             do not contain any of the documentation asserted to  establish
             the appellant meets all of the requirements and the author  is
             without sight  of  the  Home  Office  file.   As  such  it  is
             submitted that the  Judge's  approach  and  consideration  was
             correct. Even if an  error  is  found  with  the  approach  to
             paragraph 284 it is submitted that this is not material as the
             appellant in light of her immigration history, in  any  event,
             [the appeal] fails at paragraph 284(1)(c)."

Upper Tribunal hearing

13. In oral submissions, Mr Molyneux accepted that the evidence  of  income
    up to and including the date of application  and  indeed  the  date  of
    decision was sparse, and that the specified documents  in  Appendix  FM
    had not been provided.

14. Mr Molyneux reminded me that permission had been granted on  the  basis
    that the sponsor's post-decision income arguably should have been taken
    into account.   The  husband's  income  did  not  become  steady  until
    September 2014, and he relied upon a schedule of  income  evidence  for
    him from September 2014 to the  date  of  hearing.  The  appellant  had
    included  an  English  language  certificate.   He  accepted  that  the
    Secretary of State did not have the post-decision evidence  before  her
    when making the decision and that it was produced for  the  first  time
    before the First-tier Tribunal.

15.  Mr  Molyneux  relied  on  the  Court  of  Appeal's  decision   in   AS
    (Afghanistan) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  &  Anor
    [2009] EWCA Civ 1076 as authority for the introduction of post-decision
    evidence following a section 120 notice.

16. For the respondent, Miss Holmes observed  that  the  evidence  did  not
    arise from  the  matters  before  the  respondent  for  decision.   The
    evidence did not avail the appellant in  the  context  of  the  present
    appeal, she argued, and the appeal should be dismissed.

Discussion

17.  I  have  considered  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  AS
    (Afghanistan).  I do not find that it avails  the  appellant,  for  the
    reasons given in the judgment of Lady Justice Arden at [15] and   [31]-
    [33], and supported by Lord Justice Moore-Bick at  [72]  and  [81]-[83]
    and Lord Justice Sullivan at [113].  :

         "15. Against the backdrop of Section 3C of the 1971  Act  the  2002
             Act deals with immigration, procedure and  the  procedure  for
             appeal.  ...

             (iv)     The structure of Section 85 is important as it is the
                  pivotal section that we have to examine.  It this  Section
                  which deals with matters to be considered  and  thus  sets
                  the framework in which appeals must take place.  The  very
                  first provision of Section 85 provides that all appealable
                  decisions are brought under the  umbrella  of  the  single
                  appeal  (Section  85(1)).   Section   85(2)   deals   with
                  statements made in response to a one-stop notice.  It is a
                  matter of some significance in relation to  the  arguments
                  on this appeal that Section 85(2) states  that  the  AIT's
                  obligation is to consider any matter raised in response to
                  a one stop notice which constitutes  a  ground  of  appeal
                  'against the decision appealed against '.   An  appeal  in
                  which grounds raised for the first time in response  to  a
                  Section 120 notice fall  to  be  decided  is  a  'one-stop
                  appeal'.

             (v)  Section 85(4) is facultative.   It  enables  the  AIT  to
                  consider evidence about any matter that it thinks relevant
                  'to the substance  of  the  decision,  including  evidence
                  which concerns a matter arising  after  the  date  of  the
                  decision'. ...

             "31.  ... Section 85(4) ... is limited to empowering  the  AIT
                  to accept new evidence relevant 'to the substance  of  the
                  decision'.  In its decision in EA, the AIT held that these
                  words meant that the new evidence had to  be  relevant  to
                  the decision actually made. It added that:

                      'A decision on a matter under the  Immigration  Rules
                      is a decision  on  the  detailed  eligibility  of  an
                      individual   by   reference   to    the    particular
                      requirements of the Rule in question in  the  context
                      of an application that that person has made.'

             32.  In my judgement, this interpretation of Section 85(4)  is
                  plainly correct. ..."

    The ratio decidendi of AS (Afghanistan) is clear:  the  evidence  which
    may be admitted pursuant to Section 120 must relate to the substance of
    the decision which was made by the respondent.

18. In this case, the substance of the decision made by the respondent  was
    that at the date of decision and certainly at the date  of  application
    the appellant and  her  husband  did  not  have  sufficient  income  to
    maintain themselves, whether the older, broader test or the test  under
    the Rules is applied.  They produced evidence of  income  which  barely
    met the rental which they paid  on  their  accommodation  and  did  not
    demonstrate how else they were affording their standard of life.   They
    also did not disclose the existence of the  alleged  children,  one  of
    whom was then 5 years old (if the child exists).  The factual matrix on
    which they now seek to rely is entirely different from that  which  the
    respondent considered in her decision.   On  the  basis  of  the  facts
    before her, the respondent did not err in finding that the parties  had
    not shown that they  could  maintain  themselves  without  recourse  to
    public funds, and the First-tier Tribunal did not err in dismissing the
    appeal on that basis.

19. It remains open to the appellants to make an application under the  new
    rules, whether from their China after the appellant returns  there  or,
    if the Rules permit, from within the United Kingdom, but as far as this
    appeal is concerned the challenge to the First-tier decision  disclosed
    no material error of law and I dismiss the appeal.



Conclusions

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve  the
making of an error on a  point  of  law.  The  decision  of  the  First-tier
Tribunal shall stand.
