For the Appellant:     Mr Razzaq-Siddiq, Counsel instructed by City Heights
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of  the  First-tier
         Tribunal Davidson  (the  judge)  promulgated  on  25th  April  2019
         dismissing the appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision
         dated 30th September 2018 refusing his protection and human  rights
         claim.



Background

      2. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born in 1991. He entered
         this country in December 2009 as a student. He was granted  further
         leave until August 2014 in the same capacity.  Thereafter  he  made
         applications for leave to remain, firstly on Article 8 grounds  and
         then outside the Immigration Rules  on  compassionate  grounds.  He
         also made an application for the issuance of an EEA residence card.
         These applications were all refused.

      3. On 15th June 2018 the appellant claimed asylum.  We  summarise  his
         claim. He was a member of the Bangladeshi National Party (the  BNP)
         and faced  persecution  in  Bangladesh  as  a  consequence  of  his
         political activities associated both with  the  BNP  and  with  its
         student wing, the Chatra Dal. He joined the student  wing  in  2006
         and, for a short time before he left the country,  became  General-
         Secretary of its branch. In December 2008 he and two other students
         challenged Sanowar Hossain, a senior member  of  the  Awami  League
         (the political party in power  in  Bangladesh),  alleging  that  Mr
         Hossain carried out a corrupt  election  campaign.  In  March  2009
         several armed men came to  the  appellant's  family  house,  forced
         their way in and attacked him and his  father.  The  appellant  was
         able to escape and later sought  medical  treatment  in  Dhaka  for
         injuries sustained in the attack. In 2010 his parents  moved  to  a
         different area because of threats.

      4. Although he came to the UK as a student the  reason  the  appellant
         left Bangladesh was because he believed his life was in danger.  He
         claims that when he first arrived in the  UK,  and  for  some  time
         afterwards, he was unaware that he could claim asylum. He  intended
         to return to Bangladesh after his studies hoping that the BNP would
         win elections due to take place in 2014. He did not  however  claim
         asylum after  the  BNP  lost  the  2014  elections.  The  appellant
         reactivated his membership of the BNP in 2017  in  advance  of  the
         2018 elections in  Bangladesh  and  currently  holds  the  post  of
         Assistant General-Secretary of the UK branch.  He  is  involved  in
         online  blogging  and  is  one  of  a  number  of   moderators   or
         administrators of the  BNP  UK  Facebook  page.   He  has  his  own
         Facebook page and has  posted  information  in  the  public  domain
         critical of the  Awami  League  and  has  also  expressed  his  own
         critical view of the Awami League.

      5. The appellant claims to have received a threatening video posted on
         Facebook from  an  Australian  section  of  the  Awami  League.  He
         maintains that his father was suspended as a Government  worker  in
         2017 on fraud charges that were actually politically motivated, and
         he claims that his parents' home  was  attacked  in  2018.  He  has
         attended several demonstrations in  the  UK  and  claims  that  his
         attendance at these events has  been  reported  on  Bangladeshi  TV
         stations. He additionally claims that  his  name  has  appeared  in
         newspaper articles as an activist and that he  has,  as  a  result,
         received threats.

      6.  The  respondent  found  the  appellant's  account  of  events   in
         Bangladesh incredible and rejected his claim to face persecution if
         returned to Bangladesh. The appellant appealed that decision to the
         First-tier Tribunal.

Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

      7.  The  judge  was  provided  with  a  lengthy  bundle  of  documents
         containing a number of newspaper cuttings as well as screenshots of
         the appellant's Facebook posts, BNP  documents  and  various  other
         online articles dating from 2018.  In  addition  to  the  newspaper
         cuttings not  specifically  identified  by  the  judge  there  were
         several  letters  from   individuals   in   Bangladesh   containing
         assertions as to his past activities as a  member  of  the  student
         wing. The judge heard oral evidence from the appellant and  from  a
         Mr Mohammad Bhuiyan, an  acquaintance,  who  was  recognised  as  a
         refugee in the UK following a successful appeal.

      8. In her decision the judge set out the  respondent's  case,  briefly
         referred to the documents before her,  summarised  the  appellant's
         immigration history and the basis of his claimed fear, and directed
         herself as to the applicable legal principles.

      9. Although the judge accepted that the appellant  had  been  involved
         with the Chatra Dal and had been the General-Secretary of  a  local
         branch, she did not find the appellant to be a credible witness and
         rejected his claim to have been attacked in  Bangladesh.  She  gave
         several reasons in support of her  conclusion.  These  included  an
         inconsistency in the appellant's evidence relating  to  his  escape
         from the family home during the 2009 attack,  and  his  failure  to
         claim asylum when he first entered the UK. The judge did  not  find
         it credible that the appellant intended  to  return  to  Bangladesh
         after his studies if he was genuinely in fear of his life. Nor  was
         it credible that a politically active  person  who  had  previously
         made a number of immigration applications would not have been aware
         of the possibility of claiming asylum.

     10. The judge found that the appellant was not politically active  when
         he first came to the UK but that he did renew his membership of the
         BNP in 2017. The appellant said he did not provide posts  from  his
         Facebook page dating from before 2017 because the translations cost
         �20 per page, but the judge rejected this  account  as  incredible.
         The judge found that the appellant was currently politically active
         and that he genuinely supported the aims and values of the BNP, but
         that his current activities had  been  undertaken  to  bolster  his
         asylum claim.

     11. At [35] the judge stated,

             "I have to consider whether the documents  relied  on  by  the
             appellant are authentic and whether they indicate that  he  is
             at risk on  return  to  Bangladesh.   I  must  consider  these
             according with the case law of Tanveer Ahmed  IAT  2002  UKIAT
             439 which provides that it is for the appellant to  show  that
             the documents are reliable."

     12. Then at [36] the judge stated:-

             "Country  information  on  Bangladesh  notes  that  fraudulent
             documents are readily available in Bangladesh.  In  the  light
             of my credibility findings and  this  country  information,  I
             place little weight on the documents before me".

     13. The judge then summarised the background evidence without reference
         to any specific report or article. She noted that the Awami  League
         was intolerant of active opposition, that there was  a  culture  of
         corruption  in  Bangladesh,  but  that  membership  or  support  of
         opposition groups did not itself give rise to a  well-founded  fear
         of persecution in Bangladesh. The existence of a risk  depended  on
         an individual's circumstances including the level of involvement in
         political opposition, the nature of the person's claimed  political
         activity or profile, and the extent to which this had come  to  the
         adverse attention of the  authorities,  as  well  as  the  person's
         previous experiences in Bangladesh.

     14. At [38] the judge identified the issue  she  had  to  determine  as
         being  whether  the  appellant's  level  of  involvement   in   BNP
         activities and his profile were such that  he  would  come  to  the
         adverse attention of the Bangladeshi authorities if  removed.   The
         judge found that the appellant was not a leader or  agitator,  that
         he was at most a low-level online blogger, and  that  he  generally
         posted material in a closed group of likeminded people.  The  judge
         then found that the appellant's level of political involvement  was
         unlikely to be sufficient to make  him  a  person  of  interest  on
         return to Bangladesh. At [39] she stated,

             "Even if I accept that the threat  made  by  Australian  Awami
             League have made threats [sic], there  was  no  evidence  that
             these would be acted on in Bangladesh and it is the nature  of
             online  forums  that  threats  are  frequently  made   without
             necessarily representing a physical danger".

     15. The judge dismissed the appeal.

The challenge to the judge's decision

     16. The grounds of appeal contend that the judge's  assessment  of  the
         evidence and the appellant's credibility was flawed. There was said
         to be no inconsistency in the appellant's  account  of  his  escape
         from his family home, and that in drawing an adverse  inference  on
         this basis the judge acted in a  procedurally  unfair  manner.  The
         grounds further contend that the judge failed  to  engage  with  or
         take into account the  appellant's  explanation  for  not  claiming
         asylum when first entering the UK. The grounds additionally contend
         that the  judge  failed  to  give  any  reasons  for  rejecting  as
         incredible the appellant's explanation for the absence of  Facebook
         posts from 2016.

     17. The grounds then contend that the judge erred in  her  approach  to
         the documentary evidence as she "put the cart  before  the  horses"
         because she had already reached her  adverse  credibility  findings
         and  then  relied  on  those  adverse   credibility   findings   in
         determining what weight, if any, to attach to  the  documents.  The
         grounds finally contend that the judge failed to contextualise  the
         risk identified in the Facebook  post  from  the  Australian  Awami
         League when set against  the  background  evidence  indicating  the
         targeting of online activists.

     18. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted  in  respect
         of all the grounds. At the 'error of law' hearing  Mr  Jarvis  made
         his submissions in  reliance  on  two  authorities,  HH  (Ethiopia)
         [2007] EWCA Civ 306 and NP (Sri Lanka) [2015] EWCA Civ 975. It  was
         not necessary for us to call upon Mr Razzaq-Siddiq.

Discussion

     19. We are not persuaded that the judge erred in law  when  approaching
         the inconsistent evidence relating to the appellant's  escape  from
         his family home. The inconsistency,  as  to  whether  he  made  his
         escape through a back door or was rendered  unconscious  before  he
         left, would have been apparent from  the  appellant's  written  and
         oral evidence. It was open to  the  appellant's  representative  to
         have put this to the appellant in re-examination. Moreover, it  was
         specifically relied on by the Presenting Officer in his submissions
         to the judge. The allegation of procedural unfairness has no merit.

     20. We find there is some merit in the contention that the judge failed
         to adequately assess the appellant's evidence that he  intended  to
         return to Bangladesh after his studies. The  appellant  hoped  that
         the BNP would win the 2014 elections and that he would be  able  to
         return in safety when his  studies  were  completed.  Although  the
         judge does refer to this explanation in the section of her decision
         summarising the appellant's account, she has not engaged  with  the
         explanation in the section of her decision setting out her findings
         and her reasons. We find however that this  error  is  unlikely  to
         have been material given that  the  appellant  failed  to  make  an
         asylum claim after the Awami League won the 2014 elections.

     21. The appellant explained that he did not  provide  evidence  of  his
         Facebook posts prior to 2017 because the translations cost �20  per
         page. The judge found this explanation to be incredible. The  judge
         has not however given any reasons to support her  finding.  In  the
         absence of any evidence to the contrary we do not find the asserted
         cost per page to be inherently implausible. Nor  is  it  inherently
         incredible that the appellant may have limited funds and would wish
         to focus on obtaining what he considered to be the most significant
         evidence. While the judge may have been  entitled  to  reject  this
         explanation, it was incumbent on her to have  given  brief  reasons
         why she found the explanation incredible. To the  extent  that  the
         judge has held this against the appellant, we find she had erred in
         law by failing to give adequate reasons.

     22. We additionally have concerns with  the  approach  adopted  by  the
         judge to the documentary evidence. It is a trite proposition of law
         that a judge must not conclusively reject the central  features  of
         an appellant's account of events or activities  before  considering
         other evidence relevant to that account. This is clear from Mibanga
         [2005] EWCA Civ 367, which concerned expert medical  evidence,  but
         also the decision in MT (Credibility assessment flawed -  Virjon  B
         applied) Syria [2004] UKIAT  00307,  which  was  concerned  with  a
         failure by a judge to holistically  consider  documentary  evidence
         when assessing an account  of  persecution.  We  note  that  in  HH
         (Ethiopia) the Court of Appeal indicated that Mibanga was not to be
         regarded as laying down any rule of law as to the  order  in  which
         judicial fact-finders were to  approach  the  evidential  materials
         before them, and that a judge has to start his  or  her  assessment
         somewhere. We also bear in mind that it  is  not  necessary  for  a
         judge to make discrete findings in relation  to  each  document  in
         circumstances where the judge  had  already  found  an  appellant's
         account  to  be  so  inherently  unbelievable  that  the  documents
         provided in support could not lend  it  any  credibility  (NP  (Sri
         Lanka)). The judge found some of the appellant's assertions  to  be
         credible, such as his political involvement with the Chatra Dal  in
         Bangladesh, and that he was politically active in the UK, albeit in
         order to support his asylum claim. We have  already  expressed  our
         concerns with some  aspects  of  the  judge's  adverse  credibility
         findings. Although the judge rejected the  appellant's  account  of
         being attacked in Bangladesh, she did not find  it  was  inherently
         unbelievable.

     23. Reading [36] of the decision one is left with the  impression  that
         the judge  had  already  conclusively  determined  the  appellant's
         account of events in Bangladesh as  incredible  before  approaching
         the large volume of documentary evidence. Whilst she did  refer  to
         the availability of false documents in  Bangladesh,  she  dismissed
         the  documentary  evidence  principally  because  of  her  previous
         adverse credibility findings, even though some of that  documentary
         evidence was relevant to the  appellant's  account.  This  was,  in
         effect, putting the cart before the horse. We appreciate that  some
         of the documentary evidence upon which  the  appellant  relied  was
         self-serving and may  have  attracted  little  weight.  There  were
         however other documents that  did  provide  some  support  for  the
         appellant's account  of  ill-treatment  in  2009.  There  was,  for
         example, a letter issued by the President of the Youth  Wing  dated
         6th August 2018 describing his visits to the family  home  and  his
         visit to the hospital where the appellant claimed he was  admitted.
         There was a newspaper cutting from 8th March  2009  describing  the
         attack and there was a medical certificate dated  11th  March  2009
         describing laceration injuries. There were also  several  documents
         relating to the current prominence  of  the  appellant's  political
         activities which were potentially relevant when assessing any  risk
         he may face based on his sur place activities. Although  the  judge
         found that the sur place activities were low level and insufficient
         to draw the appellant to the adverse attention of the Awami  League
         or  Bangladesh  authorities,  the  background  documents   arguably
         painted a different picture. There were specific references to  the
         appellant in both news/propaganda websites  (e.g.  from  an  online
         news portal named Sabujpatardesh.com)  and  in  newspaper  cuttings
         (e.g. from the Weekly Bangla Post dated 12 to 18 October  2018  and
         11 to 17 January 2019, a newspaper cutting from  the  Weekly  Surma
         dated 1 to 7 March 2019.

     24. We acknowledge that the judge gave several reasons for her  adverse
         credibility findings and that she was entitled to take into account
         country  information  indicating  that  fraudulent  documents  were
         readily available. But some of  the  documents  relied  on  by  the
         appellant appeared, at least prima facie, to be capable of  bearing
         weight, and neither the respondent nor  the  judge  identified  any
         specific elements of any of the documents as detracting from  their
         reliability. Given the array and nature of the documents upon which
         the appellant relied, and  having  found  that  the  appellant  was
         politically active since 2017, we find that the judge erred in  law
         by failing to adequately consider those documents for  the  reasons
         she gave.

     25. While the judge  may  have  been  entitled  to  conclude  that  the
         appellant's account of being targeted in Bangladesh was  incredible
         and that he did not face a real risk of ill-treatment as  a  result
         of his sur place activities even if she had properly approached the
         documentary evidence, we cannot say that she would inevitably  have
         reached these conclusions. We consequently find that the errors  of
         law require the decision to be set aside.

     26. In light of our concerns with the  sustainability  of  the  judge's
         credibility findings and her failure  to  adequately  consider  the
         background evidence relating to both  the  appellant's  credibility
         and any risk on return, we are satisfied there has been  no  proper
         consideration of the application by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
         that, pursuant to 7.2 (b) of the Presidential  Practice  Statement,
         it is appropriate to  remit  the  matter  back  to  the  First-tier
         Tribunal to be considered afresh before a judge other than Judge of
         the First-tier Tribunal Davidson.

Notice of Decision

The First-tier Tribunal decision contains errors on a point of law and  must
    be set aside.

The case is remitted to the First-tier  Tribunal,  to  be  determined  by  a
judge other than judge of the First-tier Tribunal Davidson.

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his  family.   This  direction
applies both to the appellant and to  the  respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
