Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr S Whitwell, Senior Presenting Officer
For the Respondents:   Mr D Coleman, instructed by Paul John & Co Solicitor

Anonymity Direction
Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  I
make an order prohibiting the disclosure of any material that  may  lead  to
the identification of the respondents' child who would be referred to as  AS
and ES in these proceedings.  Any failure to comply with this direction  may
result in contempt of court proceedings.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The respondents in this case are nationals of India.  The second  named
    respondent is the husband  of  the  first  and  the  third  and  fourth
    respondents are their children.





 2. The Secretary of State  has  been  granted  permission  to  appeal  the
    decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Swaney who for reasons given in a
    decision dated 28 August 2017 allowed the respondents' appeals on human
    rights grounds.  The respondents had appealed the Secretary of  State's
    decisions dated 1 March 2016.  In respect of the  first  respondent  he
    had made a decision refusing to vary her leave and  to  remove  her  in
    response to an application that she had made dated 18 June  2015  as  a
    Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  The other respondents, her dependants,  were
    refused in line.



 3. The first  respondent's  application  was  refused  with  reference  to
    paragraph 322(2) and paragraph 245HD(a) of the Immigration Rules.  This
    was on the basis that her  presence  in  the  United  Kingdom  was  not
    conducive to the public  good  having  fraudulently  obtained  a  TOEIC
    Certificate in relation to a Tier 4 application dated 16  August  2013.
    The Tier 2 limb of the application was refused on the  basis  that  the
    London School of Marketing at which she had obtained her  qualification
    was not a UK recognised or  listed  body  or  education  provider  with
    reference to a degree certificate and diploma supplement for  a  Master
    of Arts in Marketing Innovation awarded  by  Anglia  Ruskin  University
    that had been provided.  London School of Marketing were  removed  from
    the  Tier  4  sponsor  register  on  5  September  2014.   The  diploma
    supplement relied on had been awarded on 5 December 2014.  In addition,
    the  first  respondent  was  not  awarded  any  points  in  respect  of
    attributes  on  the  basis  that  the  sponsor  had  not  performed  an
    appropriate Resident Labour Market Test as defined in Appendix A to the
    Rules although she was able to demonstrate the requisite points for the
    appropriate salary, English language and maintenance requirements.






 4. The Secretary of State confirmed that all respondents had the right  to
    appeal the decisions.  They did  so.   Judge  Swaney  recorded  in  his
    decision an agreement between the  parties  that  in  the  event  of  a
    positive finding in the first respondent's favour, the matter would  be
    remitted to the Secretary of State for assessment  of  the  application
    under the Immigration Rules.





 5. Although the judge found that the Secretary of State had discharged the
    burden of establishing possible fraud to the generic  evidence  in  the
    lookup tool relating to the first respondent's test results  she  found
    that the Secretary of State had  failed  to  discharge  the  burden  of
    establishing that there was in fact fraud  on  the  first  respondent's
    part who had established on the balance of probabilities  a  reasonable
    excuse i.e. that she spoke English.


 6. At [16] of her decision, the judge acknowledged that it was not open to
    her to  allow  the  appeals  under  the  Immigration  Rules  which  she
    considered a compelling reason to  consider  Article  8  outside  those
    Rules.  This led to her decision that the appeals were  unlawful  under
    section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 as contrary to the  respondents'
    rights under Article 8 of the Convention.


 7. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge I Boyes.  He  considered  the
    grounds arguable on the basis the judge appeared to have  accepted  the
    first respondent's current language ability, a complete defence to  the
    assertions raised.  Furthermore, he considered the judge had dealt with
    the requisite burdens of proof  in  a  confused  manner  and  that  the
    Article 8 assessment arguably lacked reasons.


 8. This appeal first came  before  me  on  14  August  2018  when  it  was
    adjourned for further submissions on whether  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    had jurisdiction to hear the appeal.  It appeared that the  application
    for variation of leave to remain had been made after the new provisions
    in the Immigration Act 2014 had come fully into force on 6 April  2015.
    The application did not contain a Human Rights claim.


 9. In response to directions I made at that hearing,  Mr  Sharma  who  had
    been instructed by the respondents on that occasion promptly  responded
    on 15 August 2018.  In summary, his contention was that the respondents
    had made a human rights claim.  Although the  decision  related  to  an
    application  made  in  June  2015,  that  application  was  actually  a
    variation of a FLR  (FP)  application  made  prior  to  expiry  of  the
    respondents' leave on 22 August 2014.  He contended that the underlying
    application was a human rights claim.  It had not  been  withdrawn  but
    replaced by the application which  led  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
    refusal.


10. Among the documents submitted with Mr Sharma's e-mail  were  copies  of
    two letters dated 18 June 2015.  The longer is  addressed  to  Priority
    Service Applications at a post office box in Sheffield.  The second  is
    addressed to UK Visas and Immigration.  Both are from the  respondents'
    solicitors Paul John.


11.  The  longer  of  the  two  letters  addressed  to   Priority   Service
    Applications explains that the firm was instructed to act on behalf  of
    the first respondent regarding her application  for  further  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  The letter explains that she  is
    currently in the United Kingdom as  a  Tier  4  Student  Migrant.   The
    documentation submitted  with  the  application  is  listed  and  there
    follows these paragraphs:


         "Our client's Tier 4  General  visa  was  curtailed  to  expire  on
         22/08/2014.  Prior to the expiry of her leave, she applied a  valid
         application [sic] for further leave to remain  FLR  (FP)  which  is
         still pending consideration with the Home Office (Ref No: S1506315)
         (Case Id: 018397037).




         Our client hereby inform you [sic] that  she  wishes  to  vary  her
         previous FLR (FP) application and proceed with this application for
         leave to remain in UK as a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.  We would like
         to point out that she should be considered as having  extant  leave
         until then by virtue of her previous application  which  was  under
         your consideration until now.  Under these circumstances we request
         you to kindly accept this application for consideration."




    The letter concludes with some non-material observations.



12. The shorter letter addressed to UK Visas and Immigration  is  in  these
    terms:






         "Thank you for your letter dated 4th September 2014  regarding  the
         application by the above named person for leave  to  remain  in  uk
         [sic] FLR (FP).  A copy of your letter is enclosed for your ease of
         reference.






         Our client wishes to inform you that she is varying the current FLR
         (FP) application  which  is  pending  consideration  to  a  Tier  2
         (General) Migrant application which is sent to the Home  Office  on
         19th June 2015 by special delivery bearing no: ZW 5627 4935 3GB.






         Accordingly we  request  you  to  stop  considering  her  FLR  (FP)
         application [Home  Office  Ref:  S1506315]  and  consider  her  new
         application for Tier 2 (General) Migrant.






         In this regard we request you to kindly refund the amount of  ï¿½1803
         paid for the FLR (FP) application to us.






         If you require any further information or assistance regarding this
         matter; please do not hesitate to contact us."



13. Mr Coleman had not seen these letters prior to  addressing  me  at  the
    outset of the hearing.  Having considered them, he said that  he  could
    not  argue  that  a  request  to  the  Secretary  of  State   to   stop
    consideration  of  an  earlier  application  amounted  to  a  variation
    application.  He accepted that because the first respondent had made  a
    new application rather than had sought to vary the earlier application,
    he was unable to rely on the human rights aspect  and  the  application
    made in August 2014 which included  a  human  rights  claim.   He  also
    acknowledged that the new application under Tier 2 could not be seen as
    amounting to a human rights application.  He  acknowledged  that  human
    rights had not been raised.






14. Both parties accepted therefore that despite  the  Secretary  of  State
    having indicated the respondents had a right of appeal, they did not.



15. Even if I were persuaded that the Tier 2 application made in June  2015
    could be understood as a variation on the FLR (FP) application made  in
    August 2014, the difficulty for the respondents is that the two letters
    of 18 June 2015 indicate that the FLR (FP)  application  was  in  terms
    withdrawn before the Tier 2 application was made.



16. Section 3C of the Immigration Act  1971  is  in  the  following  terms,
    relevant to this matter:



         "3C   Continuation of leave pending variation decision






          1) This section applies if-






               a) a person who has limited leave to enter or remain  in  the
                  United Kingdom applies  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for
                  variation of the leave,






               b) the application for variation is  made  before  the  leave
                  expires, and






               c) the leave expires without the  application  for  variation
                  having been decided.


         (2)  The leave is extended by virtue of  this  section  during  any
             period when-


             (a)  the application for  variation  is  neither  decided  nor
                  withdrawn,


                  ...


         (4)  A person may not make an  application  for  variation  of  his
             leave to enter or rem






         (5)  But subsection (4) does  not  prevent  the  variation  of  the
             application mentioned in subsection (1)(a).






         ..."



17. As the letter addressed  to  UK  Visas  and  Immigration  withdrew  the
    pending application which might  otherwise  have  been  susceptible  to
    variation, the continuing leave by virtue of Section 3C(ii) came to  an
    end  before  the  Tier  2  application  was  made.   Accordingly,   the
    respondents are unable to rely on the August 2014 application as  their
    human rights claim.



18. The grounds on which the Secretary of State was granted  permission  in
    this case did not deal with the point on which it has been conceded the
    First-tier Tribunal did not have jurisdiction.   As  I  have  explained
    even if I were persuaded that the respondents  could  have  varied  the
    original application in fact this is not what happened. The application
    which had all the features of a human rights claim was withdrawn before
    the  application  with  no  such  characteristic  was  made.  Thus  the
    decisions under challenge were not a rejection of a human rights claim.





19. Accordingly, there was no right of appeal to the Tribunal under section
    82 of the 2002 Act against the Secretary of States  decisions  dated  1
    March 2016. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is  set  aside  for
    want of jurisdiction.  That brings these proceedings to an end  in  the
    Upper Tribunal.



20. By way of foot note it will be open to the respondents to  now  make  a
    human rights claim.  I record Mr Whitwell's acceptance  that  no  point
    will be taken on delay if they  decide  to  challenge  the  March  2016
    decisions by other means.
