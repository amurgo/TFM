Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr B Bedford instructed by Iris Law Firm
For the Respondent:    Mr R Lindsay, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Iraq born on 9th July  1995  who,  having
    left Iraq on 23rd November 2018, arrived in the UK on 3rd December 2018
    clandestinely and claimed asylum on 4th December 2018.   The  Secretary
    of State refused his application for  asylum,  humanitarian  protection
    and his human rights claim on 31st August 2019 and a decision was  made
    to remove him by way of directions under Section 10 of the  Immigration
    and Asylum Act 1999.  His appeal came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    Bircher on 18th October 2019  in  North  Shields.   She  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal on all grounds.

 2. The judge made a series of findings but ultimately rejected his account
    of risk on return.  The appellant appealed  and  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Keki? found that the judge's determination contained errors of law with
    respect to her approach towards the humanitarian protection  claim  and
    that her decision in that respect was unsustainable.

 3. Upper Tribunal Judge Keki? found at paragraph 13 on her  error  of  law
    decision that "having found that the appellant's claim for  asylum  had
    not been made out either on refugee or article 3 grounds" (at 21 - 32),
    the judge then proceeded to "address whether or not it is reasonable to
    return the appellant to Iraq and thus by doing so make him a  displaced
    person anywhere in  Iraq"  (at  33).   Her  assessment  on  this  issue
    pertains only to the appellant's ability  to  contact  his  family  and
    obtain his CSID document from his home (where he left  it).   She  also
    rejects the claim that the appellant would be at risk  because  of  his
    grandfather's and father's alleged involvement with  the  Ba'ath  Party
    (38).  She rejects the claim that  he  could  not  live  anywhere  else
    because of that involvement but concludes that he does not need  to  in
    any event because he could safely return to Tuz". Upper Tribunal  Judge
    Kekic added

         "14. The difficulty is that the judge failed entirely  to  consider
             the humanitarian protection claim in its own right.   Although
             she cites AA and  AAH  at  length  (at  38-39),  there  is  no
             engagement whatsoever with the principles and guidance therein
             and she fails to apply the guidance to the facts  as  accepted
             of the appellant's case.  She makes no finding as  to  whether
             she accepts that Tuz is a disputed territory and there  is  no
             assessment  of  whether,  if  it  is,  the   appellant   would
             specifically be at risk because  of  indiscriminate  violence.
             It may well be, as Mr Avery submits, that the appellant  would
             not be at any risk in Tuz on return but that conclusion cannot
             be reached without an  assessment  of  the  situation  on  the
             ground and the appellant's circumstances.  That has  not  been
             carried out in Judge Bircher's determination.  The decision on
             humanitarian protection is therefore set aside  and  shall  be
             remade at a future date by a judge of the Upper Tribunal.

         15.  There is no challenge to the judge's findings and  conclusions
             on the asylum and article 3 claim, nor on the article 8 claim,
             and those  conclusions  stand.   The  only  issue  to  be  re-
             determined is that of article 15(c)."

 4. Upper Tribunal Judge Keki? decided that the decision of the  First-tier
    Tribunal was set aside on humanitarian protection grounds  only.   "The
    decision on asylum and human rights stands".

 5. The appellant's account states he was born in Khanaqin and moved  at  a
    young age with his family to Tuz Khurmatu.  He lived with  his  parents
    and sister.  He attended school for nine years and after completing his
    education did some odd jobs and worked in the  family  restaurant.   He
    claimed that in October 2018 an individual, who was  a  relative  of  a
    high-ranking member of  the  PMF  force,  left  a  bag  in  the  family
    restaurant with  the  appellant  containing  important  material.   The
    restaurant was then visited by the Iraqi Central Army  from  the  anti-
    terror fast response team who removed the bag. The individual was  then
    arrested.  The appellant was visited by the bag owner's  relatives  who
    asked the appellant to attend court and take responsibility for the bag
    which he refused to do.  As a result news circulated that  the  man  in
    detention had been given a long jail sentence  and  the  appellant  was
    attacked and they subsequently came to his home  upon  which  he  left.
    The appellant stated that he could  not  relocate  within  the  Kurdish
    region because of his grandfather's links to  the  Ba'ath  Party.   His
    family had owned a restaurant in Tuz for five years and he worked there
    for two or three times  a  week,  during  the  five  year  period.   He
    maintained he did not know if the restaurant remained in Tuz and  could
    not give the exact address of the restaurant and had asked  members  of
    the Kurdish community if they knew where his  family  were  but  to  no
    avail.

Documentation

 6. Before me I had the bundle which was  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    which included the Home Office bundle containing the  Asylum  Interview
    Record and a screening interview and the appellant's bundle before  the
    First-tier Tribunal which contained background evidence  on  Iraq  from
    pages 1 to 364.  The latest report in that bundle was an  EASO  Country
    Guidance Iraq Report dated 4th July 2019.

 7. Additionally, for the hearing before me on 4th June 2021 I was provided
    with material including the  appellant's  statement  dated  22nd  April
    2021, a Media Line Report dated 27th March 2020, an IMMAP weekly report
    dated 26th March 2020 to 1st April 2020, a GardaWorld report dated 11th
    December .2020, an EASO COI Report security situation October  2020,  a
    Shafaq News report dated 3rd September 2020, Baz News report dated 17th
    February 2021 and a Kurdistan 24 report dated 19th March 2020 and a BBC
    report dated 5th May 2020.

 8. Following an adjourned hearing on 6th May 2021,  because  of  technical
    difficulties with the remote hearing and the hearing was resumed on 4th
    June 2021.

 9. The appellant attended and gave oral testimony through  an  interpreter
    in Kurdish.

10. Mr Lindsay submitted that the appellant sought to  raise  a  new  issue
    regarding the CSID to which Mr Bedford objected on the  basis  that  it
    was not a new point and in accordance with the error of law finding  as
    to  whether  the  appellant  could  return  to  his  home   area   with
    documentation.  Mr Bedford stated that the CSID point was raised in the
    skeleton argument. Mr Lindsay submitted that the argument raised in the
    skeleton argument  was  a  new  point  and  it  concerned  whether  the
    appellant was able to access his CSID card and it was  clear  from  SMO
    KSP & IM (Article 15(c); identity documents) Iraq CG  [2019]  UKUT  400
    (IAC) at paragraph 11 of the headnote that the fact a person states  he
    does not have a CSID was an Article 3 matter  and  Article  3  was  not
    appealed in this case.  The issue in this matter was solely confined to
    Article 15(c) and the matter of the CSID should not be addressed.

11. Mr Bedford submitted that the appellant needed to get to  Tuz  Khurmatu
    and he could not get to Tuz Khurmatu without a CSID.  He did not have a
    CSID card and would not be able to get a new one.

12. I pointed out to Mr Lindsay, aside from whether the CSID was  a  factor
    relating to Article 15 (c), that Birch in the Upper Tribunal which  had
    found  that  the  provisions  under  Section  85  of  the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act did not apply  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  and
    although Mr Lindsay submitted that this was  being  challenged  in  the
    Court of Appeal he, notwithstanding, agreed that the matter of the CSID
    could be dealt with.  I note subsequent to the hearing,  Hydar  (s  120
    response; s  85  "new  matter":  Birch)  [2021]  UKUT  0176  (IAC)  was
    promulgated and held that Section 85(5) applies to both the  First-tier
    Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal. The finding to the contrary  in  Birch
    (precariousness and mistake; new matters) [2020] UKUT 86 (IAC);  [2020]
    Imm AR 873 was made per incuriam the judgment of the Court of Appeal in
    Alam & others v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 960; [2012] Imm AR 974 and is  not
    to be followed.  I have, however, dealt with the matter of the CSID  in
    fairness to the appellant and following the concession by Mr Lindsay.

13. Under cross-examination the appellant denied that he would be  able  to
    write to his family in Tuz Khurmatu and ask for the card to be sent and
    the appellant stated that he needed to be there to obtain a  card.   He
    was asked why his family could not simply send his existing card in the
    post if he asked for it and  the  appellant  replied  that  he  had  no
    contact with his family and he needed to be present in order to get  an
    INID card.  Mr Lindsay pressed the appellant on whether the card  could
    be posted to him but  he said he had no contact with his family and did
    not know where they are but if he needed a document, he would have  got
    it a long time ago.  The appellant confirmed that he was a young man in
    good health and he could only return if his safety was guaranteed.

14. Mr Lindsay submitted that there were  only  two  issues  for  remaking.
    One, Article 3 and whether the appellant was able to  access  the  CSID
    card and secondly, the risk of harm under 15(c).  He submitted that the
    appellant was able, practically to access a CSID card and he  would  be
    able to travel freely in Iraq.  He would be returned  to  Baghdad.   It
    was his submission  that  the  preserved  findings  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal were determinative of the claim now raised regarding the  CSID
    and I was referred to paragraph 35 of the First-tier Tribunal decision.
     The  appellant  claimed  not  to  remember  details  of  the  family's
    restaurant and whereabouts, but was  disbelieved  by  the  judge.   The
    appellant stated he could not remember  the  details  even  though  the
    restaurant was owned by his family and the appellant had  worked  there
    for five  years.   That  was  not  credible.  The  judge  concluded  at
    paragraph 36 that the appellant obviously knew the names and  addresses
    of the family and the business, and the key finding was that  he  could
    write to the family in Iraq and get  a  CSID  and  there  was  a  clear
    finding that the appellant would be able to do  that.   The  difficulty
    for the appellant was that having been found not  to  be  credible  his
    bare claim had no basis on which to be accepted.  The position was  not
    dissimilar to that in MA (Somalia) [2010] UKSC  49  and  in  any  event
    there was an express finding that the appellant could  simply  ask  for
    the CSID to be sent to him.  That was a complete answer to the  Article
    3 claim under the European Convention on Human Rights.

15. Regarding Article 15(c) it was clear from the country guidance that  in
    general there would not be a risk to the appellant of serious  violence
    if  he  returned  to  his  home  area  under  Article  15(c)   of   the
    Qualification Directive.  That was made clear by the first paragraph of
    the guidance in SMO.  The appellant did not seek  to  argue  that  this
    Tribunal should seek to depart from the country guidance and indeed the
    updating country guidance evidence in the supplementary bundle  clearly
    indicated that the situation in Salah al-Din was the same as  when  the
    country guidance was promulgated in 2019.

16. On a careful reading of what was said in the EASO Report,  particularly
    at page 55 was that unsurprisingly there were ongoing difficulties  and
    the country guidance acknowledged that there continued to  be  problems
    in parts of Iraq.  In that context the case here  was  that  there  did
    continue  to  be  isolated  security  incidents.   There  was  nothing,
    however, in the materials in the bundle even taken at its highest  that
    there was a  generalised  risk  of  15(c)  harm.   That  was  what  was
    expectedly accepted by the appellant in his submissions and I  was  not
    asked to depart from the country guidance in SMO.

17. What the appellant relied on was paragraph 6 and his time spent outside
    Iraq and the difficulty with that argument was  his  own  evidence  was
    that he could live and work in Tuz Khurmatu until 2018.  He  had  spent
    years working in Tuz Khurmatu with no problem.  It could also  be  seen
    from the EASO that the situation at that time  was  no  different  from
    that now and there was no basis on which to consider any  greater  risk
    now than before he left.

18. With regard to the other two personal characteristics, that  being  his
    age and his background, the appellant agreed in his evidence that he is
    a young man in good health and nothing in his profile indicates a  risk
    with regards to the final matter which is his background.   Mr  Lindsay
    relied on  the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  regarding  the
    appellant's credibility and his background from 21 to 38.

19. The appellant's background as a witness was rejected in findings  which
    have been preserved in the  First-tier  Tribunal  determination  and  I
    should  not  accept  anything  unless  it  was  supported  by   cogent,
    independent evidence.  The effect of this was that  the  appellant  had
    not proved the existence of circumstances capable of indicating a  risk
    on return. In all the circumstances on a requisite  sliding  scale  the
    appellant was in no worse position than any  other  returnee.   In  the
    round, he did not have a background to place him at risk on return.

20. Mr Bedford submitted that the case for the appellant was primarily that
    he was entitled to humanitarian protection because he could not  travel
    from Baghdad to Tuz without suffering serious harm.  To this end  issue
    was taken with the submissions that his credibility was comprehensively
    rejected by the First-tier Tribunal because,  for  example,  the  judge
    accepted that he was Kurdish  and  he  was  Iraqi  and  came  from  Tuz
    Khurmatu.  The judge merely did not accept the difficulties he had  had
    there and thus this was not an MA (Somalia) type case.

21. At paragraph 35 of the decision the judge said that the appellant could
    just write but that was in conflict with paragraphs 36 and 37 where the
    judge describes how the appellant could obtain  a  replacement.   Those
    findings were not alternate.

22. It was clear that the appellant  could  not  obtain  a  new  CSID  card
    because as indicated in  the  CPIN  Report  from  June  2020  with  the
    installation of new offices the appellant  would  have  to  attend  the
    office in Khanaqin in person.   The  appellant  would  be  returned  to
    Baghdad notwithstanding his Kurdish ethnicity.  At 5.6.1  of  the  CPIN
    June 2020  Report  confirmed  the  government  had  begun  issuing  new
    electronic identity cards with  the  intention  of  replacing  the  old
    national civil status card and nationality certificate.  This confirmed
    that the appellant could not obtain a replacement card from the embassy
    in the UK.  The appellant could  not  obtain  an  INID  card  from  the
    embassy in the UK.  SMO at paragraphs 262 to 267 referred to the  Salah
    al-Din governorate and at paragraph 363 of SMO Dr Fatah's evidence  was
    accepted regarding INID cards and the phasing out of the CSID card.  At
    paragraph 366 the evidence from Dr Fatah was that the CSID  card  could
    not be obtained anymore.  The EASO October report of 2020  at  internal
    page 104 confirmed there was no list of CSA offices and any  such  list
    was outdated.  An individual could not now obtain a  CSID  card  or  an
    INID card by proxy and thus it was no longer relevant that an appellant
    could not remember his family page number.

23. At this point both parties agreed that the redetermination  in  SMO  on
    the CSID point had no relevance to the issue in question here.

24. Mr Bedford indicated that at paragraph 394, it was recorded in SMO that
    some civil registries may have been damaged during  the  conflict  with
    ISIL and given the scale of the damage this could be a  possibility  in
    Khanaqin.  At paragraph 395 there was reference to  where  a  CSID  was
    destroyed, the likelihood of obtaining it was thin at best.

25. Mr Bedford indicated that the second appellant in  SMO  came  from  Tuz
    Khurmatu and although the Upper Tribunal did not make a final  decision
    and remitted the appeal paragraph 437 was instructive as  it  indicated
    that the First-tier Tribunal findings were  insufficient  when  stating
    that it was possibly at the family home.  That was not satisfactory.

26. A lot would depend on what was made of the findings of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.  There was no statement that there was an alternative finding
    on the CSID.  And there was a clear finding  that  the  CSID  could  be
    obtained remotely  but  the  supplementary  bundle  and  the  documents
    therein indicated the extent of the infrastructure damage  and  it  was
    clear there was no possibility of  a  new  CSID  card  being  obtained.
    Indeed the appellant would have to be in his home area to obtain a  new
    INID card and he could not travel without one.

27. The EASO Report dated October 2020 did show that Salah  al-Din  one  of
    the most unstable of the contested governorates and I was  referred  to
    page 141 and 142 of the report.  Further, Tuz was under the control  of
    a Shia strongman and that was relevant to the sliding scale  assessment
    where ethnicity had to be  taken  into  account  regarding  risk  under
    Article 15(c).  This was a Kurd returning to a previously predominantly
    Kurd area but run by a Shia warlord.  ISIL had a secure base  in  Salah
    al-Din and Kirkuk, and I was referred to SMO at paragraphs 262 to  267.



28. There were reports of indiscriminate violence affecting Tuz Khurmatu in
    March 2020.  The headnote of SMO at  paragraph  5  confirmed  that  the
    personal characteristics  should  be  carefully  assessed  against  the
    situation in the area to which return was contemplated  and  the  other
    personal characteristics which should be considered included membership
    of a national, ethnic  or  religious  group  which  is  either  in  the
    minority in the area in question or not in de  facto  control  of  that
    area.  There was ongoing ISIS activity as could be seen from the  IMMAP
    article at page 7 of the appellant's bundle and there  were  continuing
    attacks in Tuz  Khurmatu.   From  October  to  December  2020  military
    convoys were being attacked.

29. Secondly, Kurds were in the minority or not in de facto control and the
    Shia Militia were in control.  The appellant could not be relocated  to
    the IKR and it was because there  was  no  suggestion  that  he  had  a
    network in the IKR.

30. Mr Lindsay submitted that most of the references in  the  supplementary
    bundle concerned matters as they stood before the Upper Tribunal so the
    country guidance was a complete answer.  Further, large  parts  of  the
    attacks were attacks on the military and the question concerned whether
    the generalised risk and personal characteristics of the appellant  was
    a young man in good health, and he had support.  That  he  was  Kurdish
    and there was a Shia  strongman  in  control  was  a  development  that
    predated the country guidance in SMO and could not lead to a  different
    conclusion.  Nothing on the facts should  suggest  that  there  was  an
    Article 15(c) risk to the appellant.

31. Mr Bedford responded that the strongman was in control of Tuz  Khurmatu
    not Salah al-Din.  The starting point was the risk on return had to  be
    assessed on a sliding scale and the Tribunal must look at ethnicity and
    where he came from or the population not in de facto  control  and  the
    Kurds were in a minority or not de facto in control.

Analysis

32.  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Kekic  effectively  preserved  the  First-tier
    Tribunal findings on the asylum and Article 3  claim.   Those  findings
    were not therefore  successfully  challenged  and  remain  intact.  The
    findings of the First-tier Tribunal  at  paragraph  13  were  that  the
    appellant was a  national of Iraq who was of Kurdish ethnicity and born
    in Khanaqin and moved at a  young age with his family to Tuz  Khurmatu,
    where he lived with his parents and sister, and where he completed  his
    nine years of schooling and  worked  in  the  family  restaurant.   The
    appellant left Iraq in November 2018.  As identified the judge made  an
    adverse credibility finding in relation to the appellant's account that
    he was being targeted by powerful relatives of an  individual  who  had
    been detained by the security services owing to the appellant's actions
    at his restaurant.  The judge found that the account was not  credible,
    that the arrangements at the restaurant had not been altered in any way
    despite someone leaving an unattended  bag  there,  and  the  appellant
    changed his account during  his  substantive  interview  and  was  thus
    inconsistent.  The appellant's claim that  he  suffered  death  threats
    from the relatives of the man with the  bag  was  roundly  rejected  at
    paragraph 29, not least because there was no logical conclusion why the
    man with the bag's relatives would blame the appellant for  the  arrest
    and that his own family had not been threatened.

33. The judge at paragraph 32 found:

         "32. I am therefore satisfied the appellant has not discharged  the
             burden of proof to show with a reasonable degree of likelihood
             that he has a well-founded fear of persecution  for  a  reason
             recognised  by  the  Geneva  Convention.    Accordingly,   the
             appellant's removal would not cause the United Kingdom  to  be
             in breach of its obligations under the Geneva  Convention.   I
             therefore refuse his asylum appeal.  Articles 2 and 3  of  the
             European Convention on Human Rights were raised on  behalf  of
             the appellant.  ... As I  have  not  allowed  the  appellant's
             asylum appeal it therefore follows that I also  do  not  allow
             his appeal under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human
             Rights, as enshrined in the Human Rights Act 1998.

         33.  As I have rejected the appellant's account and found  him  not
             to be a credible witness I must now address whether or not  it
             is reasonable to return the appellant  to  Iraq  and  thus  by
             doing so make him a displaced person anywhere  in  Iraq.   The
             appellant left Iraq as recently as 2018.  He confirmed at  his
             substantive interview at question 15 that he was issued with a
             CSID.  He said  that  the  CSID  document  was  in  Iraq.   At
             question 18 he was asked if he could get the documents and  he
             said he could not.  At question 19 he said that he  could  not
             get in contact with his relatives.   At  question  20  of  his
             substantive interview he was asked if he could  write  to  his
             last address and get his family to send the documents.   Again
             he said that he could not because at question 21 he  was  'not
             in contact with them'.

         34.  The appellant also stated at question 22 that he could not get
             a new CSID card and he stated that he is not in  contact  with
             anyone in Iraq who would assist him  with  this  process.   He
             confirmed that he had been  issued  with  his  CSID  from  the
             Kharaqeen office in Iraq at question 25.  The appellant claims
             that he has lost all contact  with  family  and  friends.   He
             claims that he last saw his family and friends a year ago.   I
             have rejected his account and found him not to be  a  credible
             witness.  I do not accept that he has no contact  with  family
             and friends and in any event he has not even tried to  contact
             family and friends.

         35.  The appellant claims in answer to question 176 that he has not
             details for his family and friends  and  at  question  177  he
             states that he cannot remember the details of the  restaurant.
             This is a restaurant owned by the  family  and  at  which  the
             appellant worked for 5 years.  I  reject  his  claim  that  he
             cannot remember the name of the restaurant.  All the appellant
             needed to do was to write to the restaurant  and/or  his  last
             known address in Iraq to have the CSID card sent over.   There
             is no evidence to suggest that he has even attempted  to  find
             his relatives and friends in Iraq.  There is also no  evidence
             to indicate that he approached an organisation such as the Red
             Cross to help him find them.

         36.  The appellant has taken no steps to recover any  contact  that
             may have been  lost  with  these  family  members.   Since  he
             obviously knowns their names, addresses and the  name  of  the
             restaurant business it is difficult  to  understand  why  such
             steps to contact his family would not be taken -  unless  that
             is because he is in contact with family members and  does  not
             need to take any  further  action  to  locate  them.   If  the
             appellant is in contact with family members then his  identity
             can be verified with their assistance and the  family  records
             held in the Kharaqeen  office  accessed  in  order  to  secure
             replacement identity documents.  However even without the help
             of family members he may be able to instruct a lawyer/agent in
             Tuz province to act as his proxy in identifying  the  relevant
             documents which could be issued to him.  He could also present
             himself to the Embassy, ask for his finger prints to be taken,
             provide his name and his father's details to  request  that  a
             replacement passport be issued.

         37.  The appellant's point of return will be Baghdad airport.  I am
             satisfied that with the help of family he can obtain the issue
             of replacement documents.  I am satisfied that  he  would  not
             face a risk of  harm  at  Baghdad  airport  even  if  he  were
             perceived as a failed asylum seeker.  He should  therefore  be
             able to be returned fully documented and be able to  make  his
             onward journey  to  Tuz.   It  is  not  unreasonable  for  the
             appellant to be expected to return to Tuz where he has  family
             who can support him.  I am satisfied that his  account  as  to
             why he fled Iraq is fabricated.

         38.  There is no basis upon which he should fear  Hashd  Al  Shaabi
             forces, the Shia militia and the family of the  man  with  the
             bag.  I also reject his claim that he is at  risk  because  of
             his grandfather and  father's  alleged  involvement  with  the
             Ba'ath  party.   The  appellant   did   not   experience   any
             difficulties in Tuz because of his claim that his  grandfather
             and father worked for the Ba'ath party.   His  family  by  all
             accounts ran a successful restaurant in Tuz and there were  no
             incidents to indicate that the appellant's family  experienced
             difficulties in Tuz because of the alleged connection  between
             the  appellant's  grandfather  and  father.   I   reject   the
             appellant's claim  that  he  cannot  live  elsewhere  in  Iraq
             because of this alleged Ba'ath party connection.  In any event
             I have concluded that he does not have to live  anywhere  else
             and can return to live in Tuz.  In reaching my decision I have
             taken into account the case of AA (Iraq) CG  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
             944."

34. It is quite clear that the judge found at paragraph 34 when considering
    the CSID card that the appellant's claims that he last saw  his  family
    and friends a year ago was rejected.  As can be  seen  from  above  the
    judge specifically stated "I do not accept that he has no contact  with
    family and friends and in any event he has not even  tried  to  contact
    family and friends."

35. As crucial paragraph is that of paragraph 35 where the judge  continues
    to state that in effect that the appellant obviously  knew  the  names,
    addresses of his family members and the name of the restaurant business
    and concluded that the appellant did not need to take further action to
    locate them because he was already in contact with the family members .



36. However, the critical point is that at paragraph  35,  as  cited  above
    with my underlining,  the judge made a very clear  finding  that  there
    was no evidence to suggest that he  had  even  attempted  to  find  his
    relatives and friends in Iraq and all the appellant needed  to  do  was
    write which he had not even done.

37. It is manifest that the judge found the appellant remained  in  contact
    with his family members and made a clear and unambiguous  finding  that
    the CSID card could be sent over. The appellant was clear in his asylum
    that he had a CSID card in Iraq.

38. I acknowledge the submissions made in relation to obtaining a new  CSID
    card and an INID card but that is not the finding that the judge  made.
    I find the further findings at paragraph 36 were merely to bolster  the
    point that he could have made a  further  application.  In  the  event,
    subsequent to the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision,  the  situation  has
    changed with regard to obtaining new CSID or INID cards, but there  was
    no submission before me that the CSID cards expire in validity nor that
    the appellant could not travel through from  Baghdad  to  Tuz  Khurmatu
    with a CSID card rather than an INID card.  SMO at paragraph 21 of  the
    headnote confirmed that 'For an Iraqi national returnee (P) of  Kurdish
    origin in possession of a valid CSID or Iraqi  National  Identity  Card
    (INID), the journey from Baghdad to the IKR by land is  affordable  and
    practical  and  can  be  made  without  a  real  risk  of  P  suffering
    persecution, serious harm, or Article 3 ill  treatment  nor  would  any
    difficulties  on  the  journey  make  relocation  unduly  harsh'.  This
    indicates that travel is  undertaken  safely  in  Iraq.    I  note  for
    clarity that Tuz Khurmatu is a contested area outside the IKR, but I do
    not find on the evidence that the appellant will be unable  to  travel,
    as a young fit healthy man with a CSID card, to Tuz Khurmatu. In SMO at
    paragraph 190 the submission was noted, albeit made on  behalf  of  the
    respondent was that "There  was  no  suggestion  that  he  [the  second
    appellant in SMO from  Tuz  Khurmatu]  would  have  any  difficulty  in
    returning there". I was not  taken  to  any  background  material  that
    establishes that the appellant would  be  unable  to  safely  make  the
    journey from Baghdad to Tuz Khurmatu.

39. I permitted the submissions to be made in relation to the CSID card  to
    address any risk comprehensively but there  was  no  challenge  to  the
    factual findings  by  the  judge  which  included  that  the  appellant
    remained in contact with his family. Before me in his oral evidence the
    appellant merely denied that he could contact his family; even that was
    not attempted.  I therefore reject his oral evidence and  statement  to
    that effect. The appellant was clear in his asylum  interview  that  he
    had a CSID card in Iraq and it is logical to conclude that  his  family
    would have access to it, bearing in mind he was  working  for  them  at
    their own restaurant, and would be able to forward it to the  appellant
    in the UK.  Contrary to paragraph 237 in SMO whereby the UT found  'the
    judge of the FtT stated that the appellant's CSID was 'possibly' at the
    family  home  in  Tuz  Khurmato',  the   judge   here   had   no   such
    reservations. There was a clear  finding  that  he  could  access  the
    document.

40. I find no risk of an Article 3 breach based on the appellant's apparent
    lack of a CSID card.  I take that finding forward  into  an  assessment
    under Article 15(c).

41. Turning to those considerations  under  Article  15(c),  the  appellant
    hails from a contested area in Salah-al Din, Tuz Khurmatu.  It  is  the
    only district of the governorate to come under the  'disputed  internal
    boundary" as per the Iraq Constitution.

42. SMO addressed the particular situation in  Tuz  Khurmatu  and  which  I
    refer to below, but I was provided with an EASO  Report  dated  October
    2020 which  detailed  that  although  Salah  al-Din  was  predominantly
    inhabited by Sunni Arabs and hosts a Shia Arab minority the  population
    in Tuz district is particularly multi-ethnic and  was  reported  to  be
    "split evenly among Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen (Shia  and  Sunni)".
    Of note is that the appellant's Kurdish family chose to relocate to Tuz
    Khurmatu  when  he  was  very  young  and  he   was   educated   there.
    Additionally, his family ran their business there, a restaurant in  Tuz
    Khurmatu, for many years and the appellant worked there until  he  left
    Iraq in late 2018.  There was no indication from the appellant this had
    ceased merely that he had not been in contact. His  account,  according
    to his witness statement  and  his  oral  evidence  was  not  that  the
    restaurant and his family were being specifically targeted  because  of
    their Kurdish ethnicity but that he was being targeted by the relatives
    of the man detained because he left a bag  at  the  family  restaurant.
    Even that account was however disbelieved and that adverse  credibility
    finding stands.

43. I carefully considered the background  material  and  the  developments
    relating to the security situation particularly since  late  2018  when
    the appellant left.  The EASO Report (October 2020) refers  to  attacks
    by ISIL on neighbouring areas from 2015 onwards and that attacks staged
    by insurgent groups continue to be reported on roads  in  Salah  al-Din
    "throughout 2019 and 2020".  It reported the ISIL forces  were  on  the
    march from 2014 but most of the key population  centres  were  arrested
    from ISIS control by mid-2015 and Salah al-Din was  one  of  the  first
    governorates to witness large-scale return of IDPs.   The  EASO  Report
    also concluded that since  ISIL  expulsion  Tuz  Khurmatu  was  divided
    between  Kurdish  security  forces  and  the  PMU  (an  Iranian  backed
    government forces).  After the 2017 Kurdish Independence Referendum the
    Tuz district did experience high levels of violence.  In  January  2018
    the central government of Iraq's rapid response forces were deployed to
    Tuz Khurmatu and then, the EASO Report notes "according to reports, one
    of the Badr  Organisation's  longstanding  top  commanders  established
    himself as the 'strongman' in Tuz Khurmatu  along  with  his  'personal
    militia' that he formed with local Shia Turkmen".  In December the  ICG
    assessed that security dominance by a single group  was  a  recipe  for
    continued violent conflict.   Further,  ISIL  continued  to  carry  out
    asymmetric attacks and there was reported an increase in the number  of
    attacks from 2017 to 2018.  This was before the appellant left.

44. The country background material  provided  to  me  showed,  however,  a
    decline in the number of security incidents since 2007 and I am mindful
    that the country guidance decision of SMO reviewed  extensive  material
    on Iraq up to 17th July 2019 and much of which was in the bundle before
    me.  The Upper Tribunal considered the  information  published  by  the
    European Asylum Support Office (EASO) in March 2019 and the very recent
    posts on  Joel  Wing's  Musings  on  Iraq  blog.   The  Upper  Tribunal
    specifically considered the general security situation in Salah  al-Din
    and Tuz Khurmatu and had this to say from paragraph 263 onwards:

         "262.         Salah al-Din is a  predominantly  Sunni  governorate,
             and its capital Tikrit was the birthplace of  Saddam  Hussein.
              Only its easternmost section, which includes Tuz Khurmatu is
             disputed between the GOI and the  IKR.   Small  parts  of  the
             governorate fell to ISIL but  control  was  quickly  regained,
             with ISIL  forced  out  of  the  key  centres  (including  the
             significant  city  of  Baiji)  by  mid  2015.   These  battles
             nevertheless  caused  significant  infrastructure  damage   in
             certain parts of the governorate.  In Dr Fatah's  opinion,  as
             shared with Joel Wing of the Musings on Iraq  blog,  ISIL  has
             reduced its operations in this governorate  to  focus  on  the
             insurgency in other areas.  The reduction in ISIL attacks from
             84 per month in 2017 to 14.2 per month in 2018 would certainly
             support that theory.

         263. Problems remain, however.  Tuz Khurmatu saw heavy violence  in
             the aftermath of the Independence Referendum and has  suffered
             serious damage.  Violence continued  into  2018.   It  is  now
             ruled by a powerful Shia militia and, as Dr Fatah stated,  the
             problems which remain are essentially  of  an  ethnic  nature,
             with Kurds in that area more likely to  face  difficulty  from
             the controlling PMU.  We accept Dr Fatah's evidence that Salah
             al-Din is one of the governorates in which there is particular
             resentment to the presence  of  Shia  militia,  since  it  was
             formerly the seat of Sunni power in the country.   This  is  a
             governorate in which Shia control is most acutely  felt,  with
             Dr Fatah giving examples of the Kurdish flag being removed and
             a university's name being changed by the Shias.

         264. As elsewhere, the majority of ISIL  activity  is  specifically
             focused towards security  and  authority  figures.   Dr  Fatah
             again used the word 'selective'  on  more  than  one  occasion
             during his oral evidence and accepted  that  their  activities
             were limited by the presence of the PMUs in  the  governorate.
             He gave the example of civilians being killed at a  checkpoint
             if ISIL mounted an attack on the security  forces  controlling
             it, stating that mass attacks were no longer a phenomenon.

         265. There is some evidence of coercive behaviour on  the  part  of
             ISIL towards the rural population in Salah al-Din.  The Hamrin
             Mountain Range  extends  into  Salah  al  Din  and  there  are
             militants permanently stationed in that  rugged  terrain,  who
             exert  some  physical  and  psychological  control  over   the
             population, including the imposition of zaqat,  or  taxes,  on
             the population.  Salah al-Din also contains what is  described
             in the EASO report (attributed to the Institute for the  Study
             of War in January 2019) as  ISIL's  only  area  of  'doctrinal
             control', as  manifested  by  prisons,  judicial  proceedings,
             organised worship and training camps.  Asked about this  area,
             which is in the Makhoul Mountains of Baiji District, Dr  Fatah
             was dismissive, stating  that  it  was  "only  villages".   At
             Appendix D, we have appended a map from the  Washington-based
             Institute for the Study of War ("ISW")  in  which  this  small
             area is visible as a grave accent over the city of Baiji.

         266. The metrics for the governorate are not indicative of a  level
             of threat which engages Article 15(c)  in  general.   The  IBC
             figures recorded 152 civilian deaths out of  a  population  of
             more than 1.5 million in 2018.  The intensity of the  violence
             was considerably lower than in Ninewa, for  example,  standing
             at 10.05 per 100,000 in 2018, marking a reduction  from  28.05
             in 100,000  in  2017.   Vast  numbers  have  returned  to  the
             governorate and it is clear that the  authorities  are  taking
             regular action in the area to continue the pressure  on  ISIL.
             We  also  take  account  of  indirect   forms   of   violence,
             particularly the assassination of local authority figures; the
             coercion exerted by ISIL on sections of the  rural  population
             in particular; and the sectarian tensions which persist across
             the governorate (in Tuz Khurmato in particular).   We  do  not
             consider, however, that an ordinary civilian faces such a high
             level  of  indiscriminate  violence  there  that   substantial
             grounds exist for believing that he  would,  solely  by  being
             present there, face a real risk which threatens  his  life  or
             person.

         267.     The one  exception  to  that  general  conclusion  is  the
             geographically  small  area  in  rural  Baiji  which  we  have
             identified above as being under the doctrinal control of ISIL,
             as marked on the ISW map.  We see no reason to doubt  what  is
             asserted in the EASO report in this respect, and consider that
             the position has changed from that described at  [95]  of  the
             respondent's closing submissions (which refers to  the  Danish
             Immigration Service stating that ISIL controls no territory in
             Ninewa). Insofar as the respondent made submissions about such
             control, her stance was that  there  was  no  evidence  of  an
             actual threat  to  life  or  person  there.   We  accept  that
             submission but the inference is irresistible.  If ISIL  is  in
             control  of  the  area  and  is  operating  parallel  judicial
             systems, prisons and training camps there, we consider it more
             likely than not (given the group's behaviour  from  2014-2017)
             that the situation in that very specific area is one in  which
             there is such a high level of indiscriminate violence  that  a
             civilian would face a real risk which threatens  his  life  or
             person solely be being present there".

45. Apart from the article "Combatting Terrorism Centre at  Westpoint  (USA
    military academy)" dated 8th August 2019 the material in the  objective
    background material provided for the First-tier Tribunal predated  SMO.
    The Tribunal were clearly aware of the existence of the Shia strong man
    in Tuz Khurmatu but did not  find  a  level  of  violence  there  which
    engaged Article 15(c).  Indeed, the reference to  the  strong  man  was
    made earlier as I identify below.

46. The EASO October 2020 Report (which SMO did  not  consider)  identified
    that although ISF had "cleared" central northern Iraq,  ISIL  continued
    to carry out asymmetric insurgent attacks  targeting  security  forces.
    The appellant will be returning however as a civilian.  As reported  in
    the October 2020 report, the ISF have the overall responsibility of the
    security within the governorate and predominantly consist of units from
    the Iraq Army, Federal Police and Special Forces.  ISF does not have  a
    large enough force to control large desert areas, and have been  unable
    to retain  control  of  territory  cleared  of  ISIL  in  Salah  al-Din
    governorate, but have a presence in  some  areas  including  the  areas
    around Tuz Khurmatu.  Although the number of  armed  conflict  security
    incidents have fluctuated and continued there is nonetheless a focus on
    military targets.  The civilians killed or  injured  in  2019  amounted
    (sadly) to 97 in Salah al-Din.  In 2020 it was 49.  The rural areas are
    those said to be vulnerable.  I was also referred to  the  particularly
    high scores of infrastructure damage  in  Salah  al-Din  and  explosive
    ordnance contamination which inhibited safe returns  of  IDPs  although
    the returns to the governorate outpaced displacement.  There  had  been
    considerable damage before 2019.   In  effect  the  situation  had  not
    changed materially deleteriously since the appellant departed Iraq  and
    I accept Mr Lindsay's submissions on the background material.

47.  Overall,  I  am  not  persuaded  that  the  security   situation   has
    deteriorated to an extent that I might find that  SMO  mischaracterised
    the situation in Tuz Khurmatu in general and  the  Article  15(c)  risk
    exists there.

48.  In  terms  of  the  approach  to  the  consideration  of  humanitarian
    protection (albeit I note all country guidance on Iraq was replaced  by
    SMO) as held in AA (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2015] UKUT 00544 (IAC)

         'In accordance with the principles set out in  Elgafaji  (C-465/07)
         and QD (Iraq) v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2009]
         EWCA Civ 620, decision-makers in  Iraqi  cases  should  assess  the
         individual characteristics  of  the  person  claiming  humanitarian
         protection, in order to ascertain whether those characteristics are
         such as to put that person at real risk of Article 15(c) harm'.

49. I take into account paragraph 5 of the headnote of SMO as follows:

         "5.   The impact of any  of  the  personal  characteristics  listed
             immediately below  must  be  carefully  assessed  against  the
             situation in the area to which return  is  contemplated,  with
             particular reference to the extent of  ongoing  ISIL  activity
             and the behaviour of the security actors in  control  of  that
             area.  Within the framework of such  an  analysis,  the  other
             personal characteristics which are capable of being  relevant,
             individually and cumulatively, to the sliding  scale  analysis
             required by Article 15(c) are as follows:

             �    Opposition to or criticism of the GOI, the KRG  or  local
                  security actors;

             �    Membership of a national, ethnic or religious group which
                  is either in the minority in the area in question, or  not
                  in de facto control of that area;

             �    LGBTI individuals, those not conforming to Islamic  mores
                  and wealthy or Westernised individuals;

             �    Humanitarian or medical staff and those  associated  with
                  Western organisations or security forces;

             �        Women and children without  genuine  family  support;
                  and

             �        Individuals with disabilities.

         6.    The living conditions in  Iraq  as  a  whole,  including  the
             Formerly Contested Areas, are  unlikely  to  give  rise  to  a
             breach  of  Article  3  ECHR  or  (therefore)  to  necessitate
             subsidiary protection under Article 15(b)  QD.   Where  it  is
             asserted that return to a particular part of Iraq  would  give
             rise to such a breach, however, it is to be recalled that  the
             minimum level of severity required is relative,  according  to
             the personal circumstances of the individual  concerned.   Any
             such circumstances require individualised  assessment  in  the
             context of the conditions of the area in question".

50. The appellant maintains he is a Sunni and the majority in the area  are
    Shia Muslims and thus he would be at risk.  SMO recorded that following
    the Kurdish referendum in September 2017, serious fighting  erupted  in
    Tuz Khurmatu and then "the city was taken  over  by  one  of  the  most
    senior commanders of the Badr Organisation   [an  Iraqi  Shia  Islamist
    political party], one of the most powerful Shia militia".  However, the
    appellant did not leave Tuz Khurmatu until a year later  and  continued
    to work in his family business and reside there until  his  relocation.
    The appellant is a  Kurd  but  the  Badr  Organisation  exerted  strong
    influence according to the reports in Salah al-Din 2018  prior  to  his
    departure and when he was still there.  The  appellant  in  his  asylum
    interview  at  [34]  identified  the  reason  he  left  as  the  family
    threatening him and when  asked  at  Q[36]  if  there  were  any  other
    reasons, he was claiming asylum simply stated 'no'.  He added that  his
    national certificate was in his home Q[38].

51. On the basis of the fresh material before me, I do not  find  that  the
    appellant's  own  personal  characteristics  of  ethnicity  as  a  Kurd
    contribute to an Article 15(c) risk  in  Tuz  Khurmatu,  nor  that  the
    conflict and the indiscriminate risk in Tuz Khurmatu has  significantly
    increased since SMO contemplated the situation there.  I  have  applied
    the sliding scale assessment, but this is a young, healthy  Sunni  Kurd
    who was working in Tuz Khurmatu, and on the basis of the facts found by
    the First-tier Tribunal has  a  family  who  have  a  business  in  Tuz
    Khurmatu and who could support him.  He also has  available  to  him  a
    CSID card with which he can travel to his home area.  He would not face
    an Article 15(c) risk on return to Tuz Khurmatu for the reasons I  have
    given above.



Notice of Decision

The appeal remains dismissed on  asylum  and  human  rights  grounds  and  I
further dismiss the appeal on humanitarian protection grounds.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
