                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. Although this is an appeal by the Secretary of State  I  refer  to  the
    parties as they were in the First-tier Tribunal.

 2. The Appellant, a national of Sri  Lanka,  appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against a decision of the Secretary of  State  of  27th  April
    2017to refuse his application for asylum or humanitarian protection  in
    the UK.  In a  decision  promulgated  on  25th  June  2018,  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Keith dismissed the appeal on  asylum  and  humanitarian
    protection grounds but allowed the appeal under Articles 3 and 8 of the
    ECHR.  The Secretary of State now appeals to this Tribunal against  the
    findings under Articles 3 and 8 with permission granted  by  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Shimmin on 23rd July 2018.

 3. The background to this appeal is that the Appellant claimed  asylum  on
    27th August 2008, that application was refused on 19th March  2011  and
    his appeal was dismissed on 14th June 2011 by Immigration Judge  Moore.
    The Appellant was granted permission to appeal  against  that  decision
    but the appeal to the Upper Tribunal  was  dismissed  on  13th  October
    2011.  The Appellant made further submissions in  November  2011  which
    the Respondent lost but the Appellant resubmitted submissions  on  19th
    May 2014 and the Respondent accepted that these  amounted  to  a  fresh
    claim.  These were considered and the application was  refused  in  the
    decision subject to this appeal dated 27th April 2017.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge cited most of the decision of Immigration
    Judge Moore and used that as his starting point under Devaseelan [2002]
    UKIAT  00702.   The  judge  considered  that  the  Appellant  had   not
    established his claim on asylum grounds.  That decision  has  not  been
    challenged.

 5. The judge went on  to  consider  the  up-to-date  medical  evidence  in
    particular the psychiatric evidence  in  relation  to  the  Appellant's
    diagnosed PTSD.  The judge set  out  in  detail  the  contents  of  the
    medical evidence.  The judge considered that it  was  open  to  him  to
    consider  whether  the  Appellant's  fears  and  concerns  may  present
    sufficient mental health risks so as to engage Articles 3 and 8 of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights [57].

 6. The judge noted that Dr Lawrence concludes that the Appellant  was  not
    delusional; and took into account that the Appellant's brother has been
    granted asylum  on  the  basis  of  his  own  fears  (noting  that  the
    circumstances are different) and took into account that this is one  of
    the factors informing the Appellant's own fears.  The judge went on  to
    say; "even if misguided therefore I considered  whether  the  Appellant
    had genuine fears that the lower evidential standard" [57].

 7. The judge considered that crucial to this  was  the  finding  that  the
    Appellant was suffering from PTSD and the looked at whether this  would
    be exacerbated by the Appellant's return to Sri Lanka.  The  judge  set
    out his findings in relation to this issue at  paragraph  58  where  he
    said;

         "Dr Lawrence makes a generalised comment  that  assessing  risk  of
         suicide is impossible with any degree of accuracy.  However I  must
         assess this to the lower evidential standard.   The  Appellant  was
         assessed as currently being at  some  risk  but  this  was  in  the
         absence of any removal itself.  Dr Lawrence was clear that the risk
         would be "greatly increased', if any attempts were made  to  remove
         the Appellant to Sri Lanka.  For the purposes of the authority in I
         I was conscious that the fact that the Appellant's fears  were  not
         well-founded would weigh against this  risk  but  nevertheless  the
         assessment is that the risk was high.  The  question  was  whether,
         considering the binding authority of N, the risk of the Appellant's
         death was imminent.  I concluded that it could not be said  on  the
         basis of Dr  Lawrence's  report  that  the  Appellant's  death  was
         imminent.  The assessment of the suicide risk, while high, was  not
         to that extent.  However there was a second question that  even  if
         not at imminent risk of dying, he would be at real risk of  rapidly
         experiencing intense suffering in Sri Lanka because of his illness,
         or a real risk of death within a short time fearing  for  the  same
         reasons.  I concluded that he was at such a  real  risk  namely  of
         experiencing intense suffering.  In reaching this conclusion I have
         considered whether he would be able to access psychiatric treatment
         available in Sri  Lanka.   Bearing  in  mind  that  his  fears  are
         inextricably linked to a fear of return, I  do  not  find  that  he
         would access  any  such  facilities  available.   Dr  Lawrence  had
         considered the Respondent's Country of Origin Information  Response
         of 11 May 2015 but concluded that the  Appellant's  symptoms  would
         undoubtedly be made worse by his return to Sri Lanka and  any  such
         treatment  would  be  rendered  useless,  with  the  Appellant   in
         suffering something analogous to shell-shock."

 8. The judge went on to conclude at  paragraph  59  that,  whilst  a  high
    burden, the Appellant's symptoms "do meet the requirement such that his
    removal would be in breach of his rights under Article 3 of  the  ECHR.
    It follows that there  would  be  very  significant  obstacles  to  his
    reintegration for the purposes of Article 8".

Grounds of Appeal and submissions

 9. As indicated by Mr Clarke at the hearing the Grounds of Appeal  can  be
    distilled into one issue.  In  essence  this  is  that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge failed to consider the family support available  to  the
    Appellant in Sri Lanka.

10.  The  Grounds  of  Appeal  assert  that  the  judge  made  a   material
    misdirection of law.  It is asserted that the judge failed to apply the
    case law to his analysis of the facts of the case.  Reliance is  placed
    on the case of N v UK [2005] UKHL 31.  The  grounds  contend  that  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge raises the instant case into the category  of
    exceptionality on the basis that  the  Appellant  would  be  unable  to
    access facilities that  are  available  in  Sri  Lanka  whereas  it  is
    contended that in the case of N exceptionality  arose  because  of  the
    imminence of death, the lack of any medical care and the absence of any
    family willing to care for or support the Appellant.  It  is  contended
    that these points of exceptionality are incorporated into the  guidance
    of J which is endorsed at paragraph 6 of Y (Sri Lanka) [2009] EWCA  Civ
    362. The grounds of appeal contend that the judge failed to consider at
    all the family support available in Sri Lanka and the  foundation  this
    will offer to the Appellant to seek the  help  required.  Reliance  was
    placed on paragraph 61 of Y where the Court of Appeal said

         "The upshot of the material findings and  of  the  expert  evidence
         which (for reasons I have given) stood unshaken, is that,  although
         some  psychiatric  care  is  available  in  Sri  Lanka,  these  two
         Appellants  are  so  traumatised  by  their  experiences,  and   so
         subjectively terrified at the prospect of return to  the  scene  of
         their torment, that  they  will  not  be  capable  of  seeking  the
         treatment they need.  Assuming (what cannot be certain)  that  they
         come unscathed through interrogation at the airport, with no  known
         family left in Sri Lanka and no home to travel to, the  chances  of
         their finding a secure base from which to seek the  palliative  and
         therapeutic care that will keep them from taking their own lives or
         any admissible view of the evidence remote."

11. The grounds contend that at paragraph 43 of the decision  it  is  clear
    that family members are present in Sri Lanka and the Appellant's mother
    has assisted the Appellant in his claim for asylum in the UK.

12. At the hearing Mr Clarke referred to the  case  of  AM  (Zimbabwe)  and
    Another v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2018]  EWCA  Civ
    64. There the Court of Appeal considered the decision of  the  European
    Court of Human rights (ECtHR) in Paposhvili v Belgium [2014] ECHR  431.
    Mr Clarke argued that there are three factors highlighted in  the  case
    of AM (Zimbabwe); those  are  whether  the  condition  is  sufficiently
    serious, whether care is available and whether there is  someone  there
    to provide support.  He submitted that in the  case  of  AM  (Zimbabwe)
    there was no family in Sri Lanka and the Appellant there had no home to
    go to and on that basis the threshold had been met.  In his  submission
    in this case we know that the Appellant's mother assisted the Appellant
    by providing correspondence in relation to the asylum  claim.   In  his
    submission the judge  failed  to  take  that  factor  into  account  in
    deciding whether the Appellant could access  care  in  Sri  Lanka.   He
    submitted that the failure to make  a  finding  on  this  matter  is  a
    material  error.   He  submitted  that  the  Article  8  findings   are
    predicated on those in Article 3 and are infected by the same error.

13. Ms Iqbal submitted that the decision must be looked at holistically and
    that she submitted that it has not been challenged that the judge  made
    a detailed analysis of the Appellant's mental health which  is  not  in
    dispute.  In her submission the judge's findings at  paragraph  58  are
    effectively an analysis of the guidance given by Lord Justice Sales  at
    paragraphs 38 and 40 of  AM  (Zimbabwe).   In  her  submission  in  her
    skeleton argument the questions to be addressed in considering  Article
    3 srte:

         (1)  is there a risk of  death  or  of  intense  suffering  in  the
             receiving State;


         (2)  is that risk of imminent death or a likely rapid experience of
             intense suffering; and


         (3)  does the risk arise owing to the non-availability of treatment
             in the receiving State that is available there.


     In her submission it is clear that the judge followed that approach at
    paragraph 58 where he concluded that  there  is  a  real  risk  of  the
    Appellant rapidly experiencing intense suffering and that the Appellant
    would be unable to access psychiatric treatment because of his fears of
    return that the judge has followed AM and was  entitled  to  make  that
    finding regardless of the issue of family support.



14. Ms Iqbal also relied on the case of MP (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State
    for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 32.  She  submitted  that  in  that
    case it was accepted by the time the case had reached the Supreme Court
    that MP was suffering from severe post-traumatic  stress  disorder  and
    serious depression, showed marked suicidal tendencies  and  would  have
    been at risk of committing suicide if returned to Sri Lanka and it  was
    accepted that the Appellant would not be  able  to  access  appropriate
    physical and psychological treatment in Sri Lanka.  Mr Clarke submitted
    that there is a significant distinction between this case and  that  of
    the Appellant in MP because in MP the evidence  was  accepted  that  in
    2014 care facilities were not available  there.   He  distinguished  it
    from the findings in this case where the judge did not make any similar
    finding.  In his submission if care is not available and the  threshold
    has been met then family support is not relevant but in his  submission
    if  care  is  available  then  family  support  is  relevant.   In  his
    submission the error was the absence in the  judge's  analysis  of  the
    availability of family support.

Error of Law

15. At paragraph 37 of the decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge said that
    he considered himself bound by the Court of Appeal's guidelines  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe) rather than by the decision in Paposhvili. There has been no
    challenge to that approach.

16. In Paposhvili the ECtHR reached the following conclusion:

         "183.  The Court considers that the "other very exceptional cases"
         within the meaning of the judgment in N. v. the United Kingdom (�
         43) which may raise an issue under Article 3 should  be  understood
         to refer to situations involving the removal  of  a  seriously  ill
         person in which substantial grounds have been shown  for  believing
         that he or she, although not at imminent risk of dying, would  face
         a real risk, on account of the absence of appropriate treatment  in
         the receiving country or the lack of access to such  treatment,  of
         being exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline  in  his
         or her state of health resulting  in  intense  suffering  or  to  a
         significant reduction in life expectancy. The Court points out that
         these situations correspond to a high threshold for the application
         of Article 3 of the Convention in cases concerning the  removal  of
         aliens suffering from serious illness."

17. The Court of  Appeal  considered  the  decision  in  Paposhvili  in  AM
    (Zimbabwe) where Lord Justice Sales interpreted  the  decision  of  the
    ECtHR as follows:
         "38. So far as the ECtHR and  the  Convention  are  concerned,  the
         protection of Article 3 against removal in medical cases is now not
         confined to deathbed cases where death is already imminent when the
         applicant is in the removing country. It  extends  to  cases  where
         "substantial grounds  have  been  shown  for  believing  that  [the
         applicant], although not at imminent risk of dying,  would  face  a
         real risk, on account of the absence of  appropriate  treatment  in
         the receiving country or lack of access to such treatment, of being
         exposed to a serious, rapid and irreversible decline in his or  her
         state of health resulting in intense suffering or to a  significant
         reduction in life expectancy" (para. [183]). This means cases where
         the applicant faces a real risk  of  rapidly  experiencing  intense
         suffering (i.e. to the Article 3 standard) in the  receiving  state
         because  of  their  illness  and  the  non-availability  there   of
         treatment which is available to them in the removing state or faces
         a real risk of death within a short time in the receiving state for
         the same  reason.  In  other  words,  the  boundary  of  Article  3
         protection has been shifted from  being  defined  by  imminence  of
         death in the removing state  (even  with  the  treatment  available
         there) to being defined  by  the  imminence  (i.e.  likely  "rapid"
         experience) of intense suffering or death in the  receiving  state,
         which may only occur because of the non-availability in that  state
         of the  treatment  which  had  previously  been  available  in  the
         removing state."

18. I accept Ms Iqbal's  submissions  in  relation  to  the  structure  and
    analysis in paragraph 58.  The judge  took  into  account  all  of  the
    factors set out in the case of AM (Zimbabwe).  This was in the  context
    of a very detailed analysis of the Appellant's mental health  including
    the fact that the Appellant suffers from delayed onset PTSD and  severe
    depression [50],  that  this  was  caused  by  trauma  [52],  that  the
    Appellant had genuine fears  of  return  to  Sri  Lanka  and  that  his
    condition would be exacerbated by his return to Sri Lanka [57].  It  is
    in this context that the judge found that the Appellant would be unable
    to access any facilities available for  psychiatric  treatment  in  Sri
    Lanka [58].  These findings have not been challenged and  were,  in  my
    view, open to the judge on the evidence.

19. In my view the final finding made by the judge is  most  pertinent.  At
    the conclusion of paragraph 58 he said:

         "Dr Lawrence had  considered  the  respondents  country  of  origin
         information  response  of  11  May  2015  but  concluded  that  the
         appellant's symptoms would undoubtedly  (sic)  made  worse  by  his
         return to Sri Lanka  and  any  such  treatment  would  be  rendered
         useless, with the appellant in  suffering  something  analogous  to
         shellshock"

20. It is clear from this  finding  that  the  judge  considered  that  the
    evidence showed that the Appellant could not access treatment and that,
    even if he did, it would be ineffective because of  his  likely  mental
    state. Again, this finding has not been challenged and was open to  the
    judge on the evidence.

21. I do  not  accept  that  there  is  a  material  error  in  failing  to
    specifically address the availability of family support in light of the
    judge's sustainable findings as to the significance  of  the  potential
    deterioration in the Appellant's mental health on return to Sri  Lanka.



22. The judge followed the guidance in AM (Zimbabwe) and reached a decision
    open to him based on his sustainable findings  of  fact  based  on  the
    evidence.
