                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL

Judge Quigley allowed the appeals brought by  the  two  respondents  to  the
First-tier Tribunal on asylum grounds.  The SSHD was granted  permission  to
appeal to the Upper Tribunal.  In terms of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008, Rule 17, the SSHD's case was withdrawn orally  at  the
hearing, with the consent of the Upper Tribunal.  The determinations of  the
First-tier Tribunal therefore stand.
