For the Respondent:    Mr N Bramble (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. These are the appeals of Mariam [O], born  11  January  1976,  and  her
    partner Musibau [A] (born 19 January 1974) and  dependent  sons  [MAA],
    [MOA] and [MOAA] (born 11 October 2006, 2 June  2008  and  10  December
    2010 respectively), against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  in
    turn dismissing their appeal against the Respondent's  decision  of  21
    November 2014 to refuse their application for leave to remain.

 2. Their case as put to the  First-tier  Tribunal  is  summarised  in  the
    representations  supporting  one  of  the  First  Appellant's   earlier
    applications. The First Appellant was aged 34 and had now lived in  the
    United Kingdom for more than a decade, and her two sons attended school
    here. She had formed and established her  relationship  whilst  in  the
    United  Kingdom.  Additionally  she  lived  with  her  British  citizen
    dependant nephews here, who were dependent on her "morally". Mr [A] was
    studying towards a ComTier A4 qualification, relevant to his career  as
    an IT specialist.

 3. The refusal  letter  puts  the  Appellant's  immigration  history  into
    context. She claimed to have entered the United Kingdom on 5  September
    2001, though the Home Office had no record of this. She applied for  an
    EEA residence card on 6 April 2009, which was  refused  on  1  February
    2010. She applied on compassionate grounds  outside  the  Rules  on  12
    August 2010; that application  was  refused  on  31  August  2010.  She
    requested a reconsideration, and sought to appeal,  that  appeal  being
    struck out on 5 April 2012. Mr [A] claimed to have entered  the  United
    Kingdom on the same date as the First Appellant. He applied for an  EEA
    residence card on 18 September 2008, which was refused  on  3  February
    2010. Both parents had applied to remain on  private  and  family  life
    grounds in an application of 5 November 2013, refused  on  23  December
    2013.

 4. The applications were refused on  this  occasion  because  it  was  not
    accepted  that  the  genuineness  of  the  parents'  relationship   was
    established, and in any event they could be  expected  to  relocate  to
    Nigeria where they would be familiar with the culture and had lived for
    most of their lives; there would be no very  significant  obstacles  to
    their reintegration there, and it was not unreasonable to expect  their
    children to live there too.

 5. Evidence placed before the First-tier Tribunal included school  reports
    for the year ending 2013, one for [MAA] stating that he participated in
    class discussions and was progressing well, and another  for  [MOA]  in
    which he was described as a social student who was beginning  to  share
    with friends and peers and made an  effort  to  participate  in  guided
    activities.

 6. The First-tier Tribunal accepted  that  the  relationship  between  the
    parents was credible. However  it  nevertheless  dismissed  the  appeal
    because

      a) The parents' account of their activities here was not credible:  it
         was not plausible that they  would  have  remained  at  home  doing
         nothing for thirteen years  bar  the  Second  Appellant's  distance
         learning initiative relatively recently, and indeed this  assertion
         was  contrary  to  the  Al-hudda  Islamic  prayer  group's   letter
         describing  them  as  having  always  been  very  active   in   its
         activities;

      b) As to the private life of the parents, they had been educated there
         until 21 and 18 respectively, and had lived with  their  sister-in-
         law and her children until her recent return there, and remained in
         contact with their mothers; they could be expected to use  whatever
         experience they had  gained  (though  not  admitted)  during  their
         residence here, and Mr [A]'s claim to have searched daily for  jobs
         in Nigeria online without finding  any  occupation  that  he  could
         pursue was not credible absent corroboration;

      c) Whilst a report by a speech therapist stated that [MAA]'s  language
         skills were recorded as developing albeit with some delay and  that
         he needed to work on his social skills, and along with his  brother
         [MOA] he was registered with a local  football  team,  English  was
         widely spoken in the family's home area,  all  the  children  spoke
         some Yoruba, and they had relatives including grandparents to  whom
         they had regularly spoken in  Nigeria,  meaning  his  return  there
         would not be unreasonable;

      d) The assertion of family life with  the  parents'  cousins  was  not
         credible given a discrepancy as to whether they continued to reside
         together after one relative's return to Nigeria;

      e) Overall it was not unreasonable or disproportionate to  expect  the
         children to return to Nigeria: they were making  good  progress  in
         school and had private tuition here to help with  certain  lessons,
         [MAA] had not had any full assessment of his  speech  and  language
         skills, and there was no other medical evidence  of  concern,  they
         had relatives in Nigeria and  the  parents  had  contradicted  each
         other  as  to  whether  their  children  spoke  to  their  maternal
         grandmother; English was spoken in their  home  area  and  so  they
         could be reasonably expected to progress after a reasonable  period
         of adaption, and they could attend a prayer  group  in  Nigeria  to
         replace the one that they would be leaving here.

 7. Grounds of appeal contended that  the  decision  was  unlawful  because
    there was no detailed consideration of the circumstances of [MOA] under
    the Rules; additionally the First-tier Tribunal had unduly concentrated
    on the children's inherited cultural and family ties abroad rather than
    upon their own connections here. The importance of the  eldest  child's
    right to apply for citizenship having lived here for ten years had been
    overlooked.

 8. The First-tier Tribunal granted permission to  appeal  on  the  grounds
    that it was arguable that the factors identified in section 117 of  the
    Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 had not  been  sufficiently
    analysed and that the approach to the situation of [MAA] had failed  to
    take account of his own degree of integration here, and that there  had
    been an inadequate examination of the connections  across  the  social,
    educational and cultural spectrum here.

 9. A Rule 23 response contended that adequate consideration had been given
    to the relevant issues and that the relevance of seven years' residence
    had been fully appreciated.

10. Before me the Appellant stated that she had discharged herself  of  the
    services  of  the  immigration   consultancy   which   had   previously
    represented her. She was now supported by a representative of the Royal
    Courts  of  Justice  Personal  Support  Unit,  who  I   considered   it
    appropriate to permit to  sit  aside  her  during  the  course  of  the
    hearing. I took care to  explain  the  issues  in  the  appeal  to  the
    Appellant and to ensure that she understood them: she appreciated  that
    the main issue in the  appeal,  however  approached,  was  whether  the
    strength of her childrens' connections with the United Kingdom had been
    lawfully assessed.

11. Mr Bramble submitted that the First-tier Tribunal had not erred in law.
    There had been detailed consideration  of  the  circumstances  of  each
    child, and the grounds of appeal were wrong to suggest that  there  was
    any failing in the treatment of  the  middle  son's  circumstances:  in
    truth he had no case under the Rules as he had  not  resided  here  for
    seven years at the date of application. The consideration of  the  case
    outside the Rules  was  perfectly  appropriate:  in  reality  the  best
    interests of the children had  been  properly  evaluated,  as  had  the
    reasonableness of the relocation of the elder boys who had resided here
    for over seven years by the date of hearing. Ms [O]  replied  that  the
    reason the family wished to remain was the connections of her  children
    here.

Findings and reasons

12. The issue in this appeal turns on whether the connections of the  three
    sons born in this country have been lawfully assessed.

13. The relevant Immigration Rules that focus on  the  private  life  of  a
    family such as that before me are those in Rule 276ADE. I cite only the
    relevant passages given that no  questions  arise  of  suitability  for
    either route or genuineness of the relationships in play.

         "Requirements to be met by an applicant for leave to remain on  the
         grounds of private life

         276ADE. The requirements to be met by an  applicant  for  leave  to
         remain on the grounds of private life in the UK  are  that  at  the
         date of application, the applicant: ...

             (iv)       is  under  the  age  of  18  years  and  has  lived
             continuously in the UK for at least 7 years  (discounting  any
             period of imprisonment) and it  would  not  be  reasonable  to
             expect the applicant to leave the UK; or ...

             (vi)      is aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in
             the UK for less than  20  years  (discounting  any  period  of
             imprisonment) but there would be very significant obstacles to
             the applicant's integration into the country to which he would
             have to go if required to leave the UK."

14. It being accepted on all sides that the family have established private
    and family life in  the  United  Kingdom  having  resided  here  for  a
    significant period during which the children have become established in
    school, the question outside the Rules turns  on  proportionality,  the
    assessment of which must take account of certain statutory  factors  in
    so far as they are relevant to the considerations in play in this case.



         "PART 5A

         Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations ...

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
         the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom are  able
         to speak English, because persons who can speak English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
         interests of the economic well-being of the  United  Kingdom,  that
         persons who seek to enter or  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are
         financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

      5) Little weight should be given to a private life  established  by  a
         person  at  a  time  when  the  person's  immigration   status   is
         precarious.

         (6)      In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,
         the public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             (a)  the  person  has  a  genuine  and   subsisting   parental
             relationship with a qualifying child [i.e. who "has  lived  in
             the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven  years  or
             more"], and

             (b) it would not be reasonable to expect the  child  to  leave
             the United Kingdom."

15. In EV (Phillipines) Lord Justice Christopher  Clarke  explained  how  a
    tribunal should apply  the  proportionality  test  where  wider  public
    interest considerations are in play, in circumstances  where  the  best
    interests of the child dictate that he should remain in  the  UK  (�34-
    37):

         "34.     In determining whether or not,  in  a  case  such  as  the
         present, the  need  for  immigration  control  outweighs  the  best
         interests of  the  children,  it  is  necessary  to  determine  the
         relative strength of the  factors  which  make  it  in  their  best
         interests to remain here; and also to take account of  any  factors
         that point the other way. ...

         36.      In a sense the tribunal is concerned with how emphatic  an
         answer falls to be given  to  the  question:  is  it  in  the  best
         interests of the child to remain? The longer  the  child  has  been
         here, the more advanced (or critical) the stage of  his  education,
         the looser his ties with the country  in  question,  and  the  more
         deleterious the consequences of his return, the greater the  weight
         that falls into one side of the scales. If it is overwhelmingly  in
         the child's best interests that he should not return, the  need  to
         maintain immigration control may  well  not  tip  the  balance.  By
         contrast if it is in the child's best interests to remain, but only
         on balance (with some factors pointing the other way),  the  result
         may be the opposite."

16. As stated by Elias LJ in MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ 705 at [13]  and
    [21]:

         "13.     Some preliminary  observations  can  be  made  about  rule
         276ADE(iv) and section 117B(6). First, they are  similarly  framed:
         both require seven years' residence and in both a critical question
         is whether it would be unreasonable for the child to be expected to
         leave the UK. Second, the concept of seven years' residence may not
         be calculated in precisely the same way in the two provisions. rule
         276ADE(1) states in terms that the period must be  assessed  as  at
         the date of  the  application.  However,  the  Secretary  of  State
         conceded that as a result of section 85(4) of  the  2002  Act,  the
         relevant date for the purpose of section 117B  is  the  later  date
         when the court is making its determination. We have  acted  on  the
         assumption that this is correct. Third, only the  child  can  apply
         under rule 276ADE (iv), whereas  section  117B  is  concerned  with
         article 8 applications under which both the child and  the  parents
         can apply. Fourth, rule 276ADE is concerned with applications  made
         on the basis of private life, whereas claims under  article  8  may
         rely on both private and family life. Fifth, it is in my judgment a
         legitimate assumption that the question whether it is reasonable to
         expect the child to leave should be approached in the same  way  in
         each context, and no party has sought to contend otherwise. ...

         23.       ...  the  best  interests  of  the  child  is  a  primary
         consideration which has to be taken into account in all cases where
         the  child's  interests  are  affected.  Plainly,  as  all  counsel
         accepted,  it  will  be   highly   relevant   when   applying   the
         reasonableness test

         44.      ... It seems to me that there are  powerful  reasons  why,
         having regard in particular to the need to treat the best interests
         of the child as a primary consideration, it  may  be  thought  that
         once they have been in the UK for seven  years,  or  are  otherwise
         citizens of the UK, they should be allowed to stay and  have  their
         position legitimised if it would not be reasonable to  expect  them
         to leave, even though the effect is that their possibly undeserving
         families can remain with them. ...

         49.      ... the fact that the child has been in the UK  for  seven
         years  would  need  to  be  given   significant   weight   in   the
         proportionality exercise for two related reasons: first, because of
         its relevance to determining the nature and strength of the child's
         best interests; and second, because it establishes  as  a  starting
         point that leave  should  be  granted  unless  there  are  powerful
         reasons to the contrary.

         56.      ... No doubt it will usually be  sensible  to  start  with
         child's best interests but ultimately it does not  matter  how  the
         balancing exercise is conducted providing  that  the  child's  best
         interests are treated as a primary consideration."

17. Mr Bramble was clearly correct to argue there was  no  requirement  for
    the First-tier Tribunal to assess the situation of the middle son under
    the Rules, as he had not resided in this country for seven  years  when
    the application was made. By the time of the hearing,  though,  he  had
    completed  that  length  of  residence,  and  so  the  matter  required
    consideration outside the Immigration Rules given  section  117B(6)  of
    the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

18. Section 55  of  the  Borders,  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act  2009
    requires that a Judge must carefully assess where the best interests of
    any children lie. As  shown  by  MA  (Pakistan),  regarding  seven-year
    resident  children,  this  evaluation  is  a  condition  precedent   to
    determining the reasonableness of their relocation abroad. There is  no
    express assessment of best interests in  the  treatment  of  the  Third
    Appellant's situation at �37-47,  which  at  first  blush  is  of  some
    concern. However, when one  reads  on  in  the  decision  in  order  to
    establish whether the Appellant's criticism is  made  out,  it  becomes
    clear that this issue was the subject  of  a  finding,  for  the  Judge
    states at [60] that "I find weighing all the factors into  the  balance
    that their best interests favours them moving  to  Nigeria  to  be  and
    remain with the first and second  Appellants."  I  accept,  given  this
    phrase, that the First-tier Tribunal did in fact carefully evaluate the
    circumstances as a whole, and did assess  the  best  interests  of  the
    children separately before moving on to consider reasonableness.  I  do
    not think the second ground of appeal is well founded, as it  seems  to
    me that their links with the United Kingdom were not overlooked.

19. As to  the  third  ground  of  appeal,  section  1(4)  of  the  British
    Nationality Act 1981 addressing the acquisition of nationality by birth
    or adoption sets out that a person born in the United  Kingdom  who  is
    not otherwise a British citizen is  entitled,  on  an  application  for
    registration, to be granted British citizenship so long  as  they  were
    not absent from the United Kingdom in any one year  for  more  than  90
    days. The authorities make it clear, however, that the central question
    is the quality rather than the mere length of residence.

20. I have additionally reviewed the decision against the benchmark  of  MA
    (Pakistan) which, being a decision of the Court of Appeal  handed  down
    on 7 July 2016, was not an authority that could have  been  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal nor one to which  the  author  of  the  grounds  of
    appeal would have been alive. The overriding test that is to be applied
    takes as its starting point the proposition in  a  seven-year  resident
    child case "that leave should be  granted  unless  there  are  powerful
    reasons to the contrary" (Elias LJ at [49]). It might be  thought  that
    this authorises an approach which does not simply weigh  the  competing
    interests, but distinctly tilts the  balance  in  favour  of  the  long
    resident child.

21. Having reflected on the matter, however, it seems to me that,  properly
    construed, the overall test is that such a child "should be allowed  to
    stay and have their position legitimised if it would not be  reasonable
    to expect them to leave" ([41]). In this case there was a clear finding
    that the childrens' departure would be a reasonable  expectation  given
    all the circumstances. Accordingly there was no need for the  balancing
    exercise to begin with any particular presumption. The  matters  raised
    in the grounds of appeal essentially mount to a disagreement  with  the
    First-tier Tribunal's conclusion.

22. Accordingly I do not accept that there is any material error of law  in
    the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, which therefore stands.

Decision:

The appeal is dismissed.
