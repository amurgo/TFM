Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Uddin, instructed by Samuel Louis Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a Jamaican national who was born on 2 April 1980.  She
    appeals against a decision which was issued by Judge Blake  on  28  May
    2019, dismissing her appeal against the  respondent's  refusal  of  her
    human rights claim.

 2. The appellant entered the UK as a visitor in 2002.  She received grants
    of leave to remain (as a student) until November  2004  but  subsequent
    applications for leave  to  remain  and  an  EEA  Residence  Card  were
    refused.  In June 2016, however, the appellant  was  granted  leave  to
    remain until 24 December 2018 in reliance on her  relationship  with  a
    gentleman called Mr Rhoden.

 3. On 18 December 2018, and therefore before the expiry of her leave,  the
    appellant made an application for further leave on family life grounds.
     In this application, she relied on her  relationship  with  a  British
    citizen named Mr Myton.

 4. The respondent refused the application on 14 February 2019.  Under  the
    Five Year Route in Appendix FM, there was a single ground for  refusal,
    which was that the Minimum Income  Requirement  ("MIR")  was  not  met.
    Under the Ten Year Route, it was  not  accepted  that  there  were  any
    insurmountable obstacles to Mr Myton relocating  to  Jamaica  with  the
    appellant.  It was not accepted that the appellant would encounter very
    significant obstacles on return to Jamaica (paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)  of
    the Rules refers) or that there were exceptional circumstances  outside
    the Immigration Rules which rendered the appellant's  removal  contrary
    to Article 8 ECHR.

 5. The appellant appealed and her appeal  was  heard  by  Judge  Blake  at
    Taylor House on 23 April 2019.  The appellant represented herself.  The
    respondent was represented by a Presenting Officer (Mr Tear).   Because
    the appellant was  unrepresented,  the  documentary  evidence  was  not
    presented to the judge in a bundle but it is clear that  there  were  a
    number of documents  relating  to  her  employment  with  a  bakery  in
    Coldharbour  Lane  called  the  Bread  of  Life  Bakery.   It  was  the
    appellant's case before Judge Blake that  she  was  personally  earning
    more than �18,600 per annum  at  this  bakery,  both  at  the  date  of
    application and at the date of hearing.

 6. Having set out the background, the evidence  and  the  applicable  law,
    Judge Blake reached his findings on the appeal at [41]-[46].  At  [42],
    he concluded that the appellant 'had not established that  she  was  in
    receipt of �18,600 per annum as required under the Rules'.  He went  on
    to consider Article 8 ECHR outside the Rules, and concluded that  there
    were no exceptional circumstances  [44]  and  that,  if  the  appellant
    sought to submit that her income had increased after  the  respondent's
    decision, 'it would be open to her to submit this evidence with a fresh
    application if she was in possession of it': [45].

 7. The grounds of appeal are somewhat diffuse.  In granting permission  to
    argue the grounds  in  full,  however,  Judge  Kelly  was  particularly
    concerned that Judge Blake might not have given sufficient reasons  for
    concluding, at [42], that the appellant could not  meet  the  MIR  when
    there appeared to  be  an  arguable  evidential  basis  for  concluding
    otherwise.

 8. At the outset of the hearing before me, I sought  to  clarify  with  Mr
    Uddin (who had not settled the grounds) how exactly the case  was  put.
    I had understood from Judge Kelly's decision and from  the  grounds  of
    appeal, such as they are, that it was to be contended  that  the  judge
    had  failed  to  consider  evidence  which  bore  on  the   potentially
    determinative question of whether the appellant was able  to  meet  the
    MIR, and therefore the requirements of the Five Year Route.   In  fact,
    in response to my questions, Mr Uddin accepted that he  was  unable  to
    advance  such  an  argument.   He  recognised  that   the   appellant's
    application had been made on 18 December 2018;  that  the  focus  under
    Appendices FM and FM-SE of the Immigration Rules was on the appellant's
    financial circumstances  in  the  preceding  6  months;  and  that  the
    appellant's demonstrable annual income in that period was over  �18,000
    but below �18,600.  In particular, Mr Uddin accepted that he was unable
    to rely on a �660 bonus which was paid to the appellant on 31  December
    because, as Mr Tarlow had noted, paragraph 18(b) of Appendix  FM-SE  of
    the Immigration Rules only permits reliance on such a bonus 'where they
    have been received  in  the  relevant  period...  relied  upon  in  the
    application'.  Given that the bonus was received by the appellant on 31
    December 2018, Mr Uddin was obviously constrained to  accept  that  the
    appellant could not rely upon it  in  connection  with  an  application
    which focussed on the six month period preceding 8 December 2018.

 9. Instead, it was Mr Uddin's submission  that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    failing  to  consider  the  up-to-date  evidence  of  the   appellant's
    financial circumstances when considering the appellant's Article 8 ECHR
    case outside the Immigration Rules.  He submitted that the  conclusions
    at [44] and  [45]  were  legally  inadequate  when  the  appellant  had
    presented the judge with evidence that she was earning in excess of the
    MIR at the date of the hearing before the FtT.

10. Mr Tarlow submitted initially that it had been open  to  the  judge  to
    conclude that there were no exceptional circumstances outside the Rules
    and that the appropriate course was for the appellant to  make  another
    application in the event that her financial circumstances had  improved
    after she made the application for leave to remain.  I asked Mr  Tarlow
    whether the judge's conclusion at [44] could properly be  sustained  in
    circumstances in which there was evidence which appeared to  show  that
    the appellant was earning in excess of the MIR at the date of  hearing.
    I had in mind, and drew to Mr Tarlow's attention, the decision  of  the
    Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10; [2017] 1 WLR 771, at [99]
    in particular.  Mr Tarlow had nothing further to  add,  but  sought  to
    maintain that the judge's reasoning was adequate.

11. I indicated at the hearing that I had concluded that  Judge  Blake  had
    erred in law in failing to consider the appellant's income at the  date
    of hearing, since that  was  a  consideration  which  was  relevant  to
    deciding whether she had a claim  outside  the  Rules  in  reliance  on
    Article 8 ECHR.  My reasons for that conclusion are as follows.

12. Judge Blake concluded at [44] that the Immigration Rules were compliant
    with Article 8 ECHR and that there were  no  exceptional  circumstances
    outside the Rules which warranted the grant of leave outside the Rules.
     In reaching that conclusion, however, Judge Blake failed  to  consider
    whether the evidence before him demonstrated  that  the  appellant  was
    earning in excess of the MIR at the date of hearing.

13. That it was incumbent upon the First-tier  Tribunal  to  consider  that
    question is clear, to my mind, from [98]-[99] of MM (Lebanon).  At [98]
    of that decision, Lady Hale and Lord  Carnwath  (with  whom  the  other
    Justices  agreed)  concluded  that  the  strict  requirements  of   the
    Immigration Rules (as to sources of funding) had not been decided on  a
    whim and that it was not irrational for the respondent to give priority
    in the Rules to simplicity of operation and ease of  verification.   At
    [99], they continued as follows:

         "Operation of the same restrictive approach outside the rules is  a
         different matter, and in our view is much more difficult to justify
         under the HRA. This is not because "less intrusive"  methods  might
         be devised (as Blake J attempted to do: para 147), but  because  it
         is inconsistent with the character of evaluation  which  article  8
         requires. As has been seen, avoiding  a  financial  burden  on  the
         state can be relevant to the fair balance required by the  article.
         But that  judgment  cannot  properly  be  constrained  by  a  rigid
         restriction in the rules. Certainly, nothing that is  said  in  the
         instructions to case officers can prevent the  tribunal  on  appeal
         from looking at the matter more broadly. These are not  matters  of
         policy on which special weight has to be accorded to  the  judgment
         of the  Secretary  of  State.  There  is  nothing  to  prevent  the
         tribunal, in the context of the HRA appeal, from judging for itself
         the reliability of any alternative sources of finance in the  light
         of the evidence before it. In doing  so,  it  will  no  doubt  take
         account of such considerations as those discussed by Lord Brown and
         Lord Kerr in Mahad, including the difficulties of proof highlighted
         in the quotation from Collins J. That being the position before the
         tribunal, it would make little sense  for  decision-makers  at  the
         earlier stages to be forced to take a narrower approach which  they
         might be unable to defend on appeal."

14. The judge was invited  to  consider  the  up-to-date  evidence  of  the
    appellant's earnings.  He was not entitled to  consider  that  evidence
    when considering the case with  reference  to  the  Immigration  Rules,
    which focus on a set period preceding the date of the application,  but
    he was not so constrained when considering the  position  more  broadly
    outside the Rules.  The appellant had submitted to the judge  that  her
    income had increased before the  hearing  and  that  she  was  able  to
    demonstrate at that date that her income exceeded the MIR.   The  judge
    should have considered that submission and the evidence which bore upon
    it.  It did not suffice merely to conclude, as he  did  at  [44],  that
    there were no exceptional circumstances.

15. I indicated that Judge Blake's decision outside the Rules would be  set
    aside and asked for submissions on whether I should remake the decision
    on the appeal myself or whether it should be remitted to the FtT for  a
    further hearing.  Both advocates urged me to remake the decision on the
    appeal for myself.

16. I asked Mr Uddin whether the appellant's financial  circumstances  were
    the same as they had been at the  date  of  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Blake.  He indicated that there was further evidence  in  the  form  of
    payslips and bank statements to establish the appellant's earnings from
    the bakery.  These had not been filed or served, however.   I  gave  Mr
    Uddin time to show these documents to Mr Tarlow, and indicated that the
    respondent was entitled to submit that they should be filed and  served
    in the proper way and that there should be a further hearing  at  which
    any difficulties with those documents could be considered.

17. On resuming the hearing, Mr Tarlow  helpfully  indicated  that  he  had
    considered the payslips and bank statements in the appellant's name and
    that  he  was  'entirely  satisfied'  that  the  appellant's  financial
    circumstances were as claimed.  Mr Uddin indicated that  the  appellant
    was shown to be earning �1576.32 gross per month and an annual bonus of
    �660, which amounted to �19,515.84 per annum.  At my request, Mr Tarlow
    confirmed that he was satisfied that the appellant was earning that sum
    at today's date.  I asked him  whether,  in  those  circumstances,  the
    Secretary  of  State  sought  to  submit  that  the  appeal  should  be
    dismissed, whether on the basis that the appellant should make a  fresh
    application for leave or otherwise.  He indicated that he did not  seek
    to make such a submission, as a result of which I was able to  indicate
    that the appeal would be allowed on Article 8 ECHR grounds.

18. As I have already stated, the only basis upon which the  appellant  was
    unsuccessful under the Five Year Route was that she was not shown to be
    earning above the MIR in the period preceding  the  application.   That
    remains the position but  it  is  clear  from  MM  (Lebanon)  that  the
    Tribunal is not confined by the evidential strictures of Appendices  FM
    and FM-SE when considering  whether  an  individual  will  represent  a
    financial burden on  the  state.   Where,  as  here,  the  evidence  is
    accepted to show that the appellant currently earns more than the  MIR,
    it is difficult to see why it could be  said  to  be  proportionate  to
    require her to make another application to the Secretary  of  State  in
    reliance upon that greater income.  In fairness to Mr  Tarlow,  he  did
    not seek to make that submission.  Nor, pragmatically, did he  seek  to
    submit that the respondent was able  to  show  that  her  decision  was
    proportionate on any other basis, whether by reference to Part 5A  NIAA
    2002 or otherwise.

19. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that  the  appellant  demonstrably
    meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules  as  at  today's  date;
    that she would be certain to be granted leave to remain on  that  basis
    if  she  made  a  further   application;   and   that   it   would   be
    disproportionate under Article 8 ECHR to expect her  to  make  such  an
    application, or to remove her from the United Kingdom.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT(IAC) was materially erroneous  in  law  and  is  set
aside to the extent set out above.  I remake the decision on the appeal  and
allow the appeal on Article 8 ECHR grounds.
