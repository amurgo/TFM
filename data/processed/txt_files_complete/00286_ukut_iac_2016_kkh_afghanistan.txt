For the Appellant:     Mr S. Saeed, Solicitor Advocate for Aman
                  Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr S. Kandola, Senior Presenting Officer

    (i) Article 9 -  the  right  to  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and
    religion - is a distinctive feature of  the  Human  Rights  Act  to  be
    considered separately from Article 8 when it applies.


    (ii) Article 9 permits the same structured approach to  the  assessment
    of an Article 8 human rights claim identified by Lord Bingham in his 5-
    stage approach set out in paragraph 17 of Razgar [2004]  UKHL  27  save
    for the omission of the 'economic well-being of the country'  criterion
    in Article 9(2).

    (iii) In an appeal where the violation is alleged to occur by reason of
    removal from the United Kingdom, the test  of  proportionality  governs
    the exercise of Article 9 rights and not the  more  stringent  approach
    involving whether the returnee is at risk of a flagrant denial or gross
    violation in his home country.


    (iv) A further distinctive feature is the creation of a statutory right
    in s.13 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998,  independent  of  Article  9,
    enabling a religious organisation to benefit from the Convention  right
    to freedom of thought, conscience and religion  alongside  its  members
    collectively and individually.


    (v) Matters relied  on  by  way  of  a  positive  contribution  to  the
    community are capable in principle of affecting the weight to be  given
    to the maintenance of effective immigration control and should  not  be
    excluded from consideration altogether but are unlikely in practice  to
    carry much weight.


    (vi) The operation of the Immigration  Rules  will  not  amount  to  an
    unlawful interference in the selection of a religious leader  when  the
    personality of the appellant has not influenced the decision and  where
    anybody in the same position as the appellant who  fails  to  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules is likely to be refused.

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and immigration history

    1. The appellant is a citizen of Afghanistan, who was born on 1 January
       1989 and  is  now  aged  27.   He  was  encountered  by  immigration
       officials on 8 January 2007 concealed in the back of a lorry and was
       notified of his liability to be removed.  At  interview  he  claimed
       that he was 17 years of age but an age assessment concluded that  he
       was over the age of 18. He claimed asylum but  his  application  was
       refused on 29 May 2007. He appealed against that decision on  asylum
       and  human  rights   grounds,   his   appeal   was   dismissed   and
       reconsideration was refused. His statutory rights of  appeal  became
       exhausted  in  October  2007.  Eventually,  in  February  2011,  the
       appellant sought judicial review  of  the  respondent's  refusal  to
       treat his further submissions as a fresh claim. Those were summarily
       refused by Thirlwall J on  1  June  2011  who  considered  that  the
       respondent's decision-making  process  had  been  lawful,  that  the
       proceedings were bound to fail and that renewal would not operate as
       a bar to removal.


    2. It was at this stage that the Afghanistan  Islamic  Cultural  Centre
       (AICC) sought to intervene as an  interested  party  in  support  of
       further submissions which resulted in a hearing on 11 November  2011
       at which permission to seek judicial review was  ordered,  it  being
       arguable that the Secretary of State had unlawfully failed  to  take
       into  account  the  benefit  that  the  appellant  provided  to  the
       community  and  the  impact  on  the  community  of   his   removal,
       demonstrated by numbers of letters of support and a petition, signed
       by some 945 signatories in terms that the appellant 'contributed  to
       serving  our  community,  maintaining  a  peaceful  and   harmonious
       society'. The Secretary of State agreed to reconsider the claim  and
       a further decision was made on 17 August 2012  refusing  his  claims
       both under the Refugee Convention and the ECHR. This was subject  to
       an appeal which was heard on 1 February 2013. At the appeal hearing,
       the appellant withdrew his asylum claim as well as his claims  under
       Articles 3 and for humanitarian protection.

    3. The appellant then placed reliance on Articles 8, 9 and s. 13 of the
       Human Rights Act. In support of  this  application  he  submitted  a
       report of April 2009 dealing with the  Afghan  Muslim  community  in
       England, a report to which I shall make reference later. Eventually,
       the respondent conducted a comprehensive reassessment  of  the  case
       and a further decision was made as long ago as  20  September  2013.
       On  24  September  2013  the  Secretary  of  State  issued   removal
       directions.


    4. The appellant appealed against these decisions repeating  the  claim
       that his removal would be a breach of his rights  under  Articles  8
       and 9 of the ECHR and s. 13 of the Human Rights Act 1998.


    5. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Petherbridge  promulgated  his  decision
       dismissing the appellant's appeal on 25 May 2014.  Subsequent  to  a
       successful challenge in accordance with the principles identified in
       Cart v The Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28, permission  to  appeal  to
       the Upper Tribunal was granted by Mr C. M.  G.  Ockelton,  the  Vice
       President, on 21 May 2015. In granting permission to pursue the Cart
       challenge, Singh J identified a double failure to address Article  9
       of the ECHR as well as s. 13 of the Human Rights Act.


    6. Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Saini decided on  19  August  2015  that
       Judge Petherbridge's decision should be set aside  adopting  as  his
       reason the Judge's failure to address Article 9  and  s.  13.   Both
       Article 9 of the Convention and s.13 of the Human  Rights  Act  1998
       are largely unfamiliar to practitioners and this is one of  the  few
       cases to come before  the  Tribunal  which  expressly  raises  these
       provisions as a distinct and separate challenge to the  respondent's
       removal decision.  It was only this aspect of the  appeal  that  was
       pursued before me.


The Afghan Community within the United Kingdom

    7. Reliance was placed  by  the  appellant  and  AICC  on  the  general
       conditions in which the Afghan Muslim community lives in the  United
       Kingdom.  A report entitled 'The Afghan Muslim Community in  England
       - Understanding Muslim Ethnic Communities' is one of 13  reports  on
       England's Muslim ethnic communities  commissioned  by  the  Cohesion
       Directorate of Communities and Local Government (CLG).  It describes
       the Afghan community in these broad terms:

      In Afghanistan the dominant religion has traditionally been  the  sect
           of Sunni Islam following the Hanafi School of  Jurisprudence.  A
           large proportion of the Sunni  population  in  Afghanistan  also
           adheres to the Deobandi tradition, which is believed to have had
           a strong influence on the Taliban. The majority  of  Afghans  in
           the UK are also  Sunni  Muslims,  but  there  is  a  significant
           minority of Shi'a,  particularly  those  of  the  Hazara  ethnic
           group. There are  also  reported  to  be  some  'important  Sufi
           families' in London and a large  Afghan  Sikh  community.  Views
           about religion are  contradictory.  Some  sources  suggest  that
           there is a 'stricter' form of Islamic practice driven by  people
           who have arrived during the later stages of the recent conflicts
           in Afghanistan, as well as a visible  tendency  towards  greater
           religiosity among young people. Others however suggest that most
           Afghans in the UK are more  culturally  Muslim  than  devout  in
           their religious practice, and that there is a sizeable  part  of
           the community with communist sympathies that does not  subscribe
           to any form of religion at all. Culture and ethnicity appear  to
           play a  more  significant  role  in  the  way  Afghans  identify
           themselves  than  religion.  Most  respondents  expressed  their
           relationship  with  Islam  as  something  personal  and  in  the
           background, something that informs their values and attitudes to
           life, but which does not play an outwardly visible role. In  the
           past, Afghans attended mosques established by other communities,
           including  contributing  to   the   building   of   mosques   in
           collaboration with other Muslim groups. However Afghan  cultural
           practices, particularly  funereal  rites,  differ  substantially
           from those of other  Muslim  communities,  and  this  factor  is
           thought to have contributed significantly to the development  of
           separate mosques for the community. It certainly seems  to  have
           been a strong influential factor in the decision  to  build  the
           Afghan  mosque  in  Neasden,  along  with  pressure  from  other
           communities concerning accepted rituals and forms of worship.

    8. Reliance, in particular, is placed on the passage above which refers
       to the differences in practice between Afghan  Muslims  and  others:
       'Afghan cultural  practices,  particularly  funereal  rites,  differ
       substantially from those of other Muslim communities'.

Facts


    9. There is very little dispute about the activities performed  by  the
       appellant.  These are described in his statement dated 2  May  2014.
       The appellant described how  over  the  years,  he  had  established
       strong links with the Afghan community in the  United  Kingdom.  For
       many years, he had performed the voluntary work for the AICC and has
       built up strong and close relationships with many people  there  and
       in the Afghan embassy. He describes how he performed this  voluntary
       work out of a desire to help others. In paragraphs 20 to 24  of  his
       statement he describes  his  activities  as  including  helping  and
       advising the community on Islamic issues, organising  prayer  times,
       leading the congregation in  daily  prayers  and  congregate  Friday
       prayers. In particular, he led prayers during Ramadan  reciting  the
       Qu'ran which he has committed to memory in its  entirety  (a  Hafiz,
       lit. a guardian or  memoriser  of  the  Qu'ran).   He  also  assists
       families with funerals, arranging memorial  services,  participating
       in and leading the ceremonies for the dead and visiting families  in
       their homes. He  assists  in  mediating  in  domestic  problems.  He
       conducts Islamic Nikah ceremonies in what he asserts is  a  somewhat
       complex procedure for which he is qualified (and has  been  for  the
       last six years). In addition he teaches over  100  children  at  the
       AICC. He works with the young and with the local  police  on  issues
       concerning youth, street crimes and public disorder. He is concerned
       with the building of community relations as well as seeking to build
       a more unified Muslim community in the United Kingdom.  At  present,
       he  is  not  permitted  to  take  up  paid  employment.  The   above
       description of his functions is confirmed by a number  of  witnesses
       who have made statements.


   10. The  material  in  support  of  the  appellant's  claim  included  a
       petition,  letters  of  support  from   various   Afghan   community
       associations, correspondence from, and to, members of Parliament and
       numerous other  supporting  letters  from  councillors,  solicitors,
       friends and supporters. This support included a Note Verbal dated 15
       April 2014 from London's Ambassador at the embassy  of  the  Islamic
       Republic of Afghanistan.

   11. Although the ambassador is  plainly  speaking  only  in  a  personal
       capacity, his words echoed much of what others had said.   He  spoke
       of his contact with the appellant through the embassy. Embassy staff
       visited the AICC during the last 10 days of Ramadan in 2013.  There,
       the prayers were led by the appellant  who  also  leads  the  weekly
       Friday prayers at the AICC and funeral  prayers.  He  also  leads  a
       regular weekly service on Sundays at the AICC. The  embassy  was  so
       much impressed by the appellant's recitation of the Qu'ran that,  in
       the Note Verbal of 15 April 2014, the ambassador spoke  of  inviting
       him to recite suitable verses at large events or anniversaries.  The
       appellant also acts providing advice on  issues  within  the  Afghan
       community  and,  as  a  minister  of  religion,  the  appellant   is
       appreciated throughout the Afghan  community.   He  teaches  at  the
       Madrasa.  He speaks Pashtu and Dari fluently, which is  said  to  be
       rare.

   12. The bundle supplied by the appellant's  solicitors  on  6  May  2014
       contains over  100  pages  of  witness  statements  and  letters  of
       support.  It includes support from the Chairman and the Trustees  of
       the  AICC.   He  is  described  as  having  a   strong   charismatic
       personality with a good positive influence upon those around him.  I
       have no reason to doubt the high regard in which  the  appellant  is
       held by the Afghan Muslim community.

   13. More recently there has been unfortunate division amongst the Muslim
       community and on 6 March 2016,  according  to  the  evidence  of  Mr
       Zubair Mohammadi, the Secretary of the AICC, a group of its  members
       attempted to stage a coup against the board of  the  AICC.   He  has
       been locked out of his  office.   He  described  how  the  situation
       became quite  ugly  and  the  police  were  called.  Fortunately  no
       violence ensued. Mr Mohammadi maintains his view that the AICC could
       not function without the appellant  and  cites  the  view  of  those
       involved in the attempted coup that, although they tried  to  depose
       the appellant, they could not do so  because  there  was  nobody  to
       replace him.

   14. Mr Mohammadi describes the AICC  placing  an  advertisement  in  the
       Eastern Eye newspaper in which a replacement for  the  appellant  is
       advertised in these terms:

                     Wanted: Farsi-Pashto Speaking Imam
                         Salary - �27,000 per annum

      Minimum requirements-the applicant must:
    . Be an experienced  Hafiz  and  Qari  (i.e.  must  have  memorised  all
      Holy Qu'ran with correct recitation)
    . Be fluent in Farsi and Pashto
    . Have minimum three years experience as an imam in a      mosque
    . Have minimum three years of experience in teaching  Holy   Qu'ran  and
      Islamic Studies to kids
    . Possess high degree of Islamic etiquette
    . Provide minimum five references from the prominent members     of  the
      Afghan Muslim community in London


   Main duties
    . Leading all daily prayers
    . Teaching Holy Qu'ran and Islamic Studies to children
    . Carrying out marriage and funeral services etc

   15.  Mr  Mohammadi  told  me  there  had  been  no  response   to   that
       advertisement.  In addition, in paragraph 10 of his statement  of  2
       May 2014 [Tab B pages  52-3]  he  had  said  that,  in  response  to
       advertisements, he had received 8 applications and had interviewed 5
       candidates from the Afghan community as  well  as  other  nationals.
       The candidates interviewed were either not Hafiz of  the  Qu'ran  or
       had little knowledge of Afghan cultures and could not  speak  Pashto
       and Dari or understand Islamic law.





The Secretary of State's response


   16. The appellant's work is not disputed by  the  respondent.   However,
       the issue  arises  as  to  whether  the  applicant  is,  in  effect,
       irreplaceable. If he is not absolutely irreplaceable, the respondent
       contends the appellant and the AICC  have  failed  to  establish  he
       cannot be replaced for all reasonable and practical purposes.


   17.    The  Secretary  of  State  relies  upon  the   appellant's   poor
       immigration history and the public interest in the removal of  those
       who have flouted immigration law,  the  fact  that  the  Immigration
       Rules permit ministers of religion (a wide-ranging term  that  would
       include the appellant) to enter the United Kingdom lawfully and that
       there are in any event some 56,000 Afghans in the United Kingdom  as
       a potential source of recruitment for an individual to replace  him.
       She points  out  that  there  has  been  no  extensive  national  or
       international effort at recruitment.  Further, the respondent  noted
       that the appellant's educational background is limited:  he  arrived
       in the United Kingdom at the age of 17 or 18 and had only previously
       received 3� years study at a Madrasa.


The Convention and Statutory Provisions

   18. Article 9 ECHR states as follows:

         ARTICLE 9
         Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
         1. Everyone has the right to freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and
         religion; this right includes freedom to  change  his  religion  or
         belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in
         public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in  worship,
         teaching, practice and observance.
         2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall  be  subject
         only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary
         in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for  the
         protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection
         of the rights and freedoms of others.



    1. A distinctive feature of the Human Rights  Act's  treatment  of  the
       right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is to place  it
       in a distinct category of protection and to create a statutory right
       which is independent of the Article 9  Convention  right.   This  is
       found in s.13:





         13. Freedom of thought, conscience and religion
         (1) If a court's determination of any question arising  under  this
         Act might affect the exercise by a religious  organisation  (itself
         or its members collectively) of the Convention right to freedom  of
         thought, conscience and religion, it must have particular regard to
         the importance of that right.
         (2) In this section "court" includes a tribunal.


   19. It is first necessary to consider the relationship between Article 8
       and  9.   The  two  Articles  are  quite  separate;  nether  one  is
       subservient to the  other.   Any  suggestion  that  the  appellant's
       Article 8 rights were improperly assessed by reason of  the  failure
       to consider his Article 9  rights  is  misplaced.   An  individual's
       Article 9 rights are free-standing.  So much is clear from s.  1  of
       the Human Rights Act which incorporates the ECHR into  domestic  law
       and does so without creating a hierarchy of rights such that Article
       9 rights are seen as a constituent part of the individual's  Article
       8 rights:


            1 The Convention RightsE+W+S+N.I.

       (1)In  this  Act  "the  Convention  rights"  means  the  rights   and
           fundamental freedoms set out in-
            (a)Articles 2 to 12 and 14 of the Convention,


   20. The Convention rights are domesticated into United  Kingdom  law  by
       s.6:


            6 Acts of public authoritiesE+W+S+N.I.

      (1)It is unlawful for a public authority to act  in  a  way  which  is
           incompatible with a Convention right.


   21. Turning to  s.  13  of  Human  Rights  Act,  the  reference  to  the
       'importance of the right' to  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and
       religion is striking in that no other Convention right  is  afforded
       this treatment.


   22. Secondly the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is
       protected not only for the benefit of individuals but organisations:
       'a  religious  organisation...itself'.   This  is  something  of   a
       contradiction in terms:  a human right enjoyed by  an  organisation.
       This  is  comprehensible  by  reference  to  the   members   of   an
       organisation enjoying  human  rights  but  s.  13  goes  further  by
       distinguishing between the human rights of its members and the human
       rights of the organisation: 'a religious organisation (itself or its
       members collectively)'.  Thus, for example, the  Church  of  England
       has the Convention right  to  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and
       religion alongside its members collectively and individually.

   23. Section 13 of the Human Rights Act appears to be the result  of  the
       decision of the ECtHR in X and the Church of  Scientology  v  Sweden
       (Case 7805/77) in which  the  Court  considered,  as  a  preliminary
       issue,  whether  the  Church  of  Scientology,   which   had   legal
       personality, was capable of exercising Article  9  (1)  rights.  The
       Commission, reversing its  earlier  position,  considered  that  the
       distinction  between  Church  and  its   members   was   essentially
       artificial.  The Court upheld the  Commission's  revised  view:  the
       church in its application was in reality doing so on behalf  of  its
       members.

   24.  Thirdly, s.13 is itself free-standing.   It  is  entirely  separate
       from the domestication into United Kingdom law of the  ECHR.   Hence
       the  right  to  freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and  religion  is
       protected by two independent sections of the Human Rights  Act:  s.6
       and s.13.  In granting permission Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge  Saini
       said


      The Tribunal erred in its consideration of Article 8 in  relation  to
           the appellant's functions for the Afghan Islamic Cultural Centre
           ("AICC") and the effect his removal will have upon the Article 9
           ECHR rights of the congregation through s. 13 HRA 1998.

   25. Insofar as this  passage  might  suggest  there  was  a  correlation
       between Article 8 and 9 such that the Article 9  claim  is  advanced
       through the medium of Article 8 and, further, that Article 9 is  the
       prism through which s.13 is assessed, I have concluded that this  is
       not the correct analysis of the relationship between  these  various
       provisions for the reasons I shall later give.  Each is  independent
       of the other and requires separate assessment.


   26. Fourthly, it is directed towards Courts and Tribunals.   They  alone
       bear the statutory duty to apply it.  Nevertheless,  out  of  a  due
       sense of deference, decision makers themselves might  properly  take
       its provisions into effect, if they are not already doing so.

Articles 8 and 9 compared

   27. Both Article 8 and Article 9 are expressed in  terms  that  are  not
       absolute.  Each is a qualified right.  However, the qualified nature
       of the  right  is  expressed  in  different  terms.   This  is  best
       demonstrated by a synoptic version of the two Articles:



|                        |                          |

|and freedoms of others. |                          |



   28. It is readily understandable that an individual's human  rights  may
       be outweighed by the economic well-being of  the  country:  hence  a
       claim to remain which operates as a burden upon the state may  be  a
       legitimate reason for refusing the claim; it is often  expressed  as
       the  public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration  control.    The
       economic well-being of the  country  is  however  omitted  from  the
       factors that qualify the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
       religion. Whilst the concept of  a  right  to  freedom  of  thought,
       conscience and religion can less obviously be seen as  operating  in
       the realm of economic activity (the  biblical  antithesis,  perhaps,
       between God and mammon) the fact that a person who claims the  right
       to exercise his freedom of religion may result in his being a burden
       on the state or the public at large is just as significant a  factor
       in an Article 9 case as it is in an Article 8 case.


The applicability of the Razgar test


   29. The concept of  proportionality  nowhere  finds  expression  in  the
       qualified nature of an individual's Article 8 or 9  rights.   It  is
       most often articulated in Article  8  cases  by  reference  to  Lord
       Bingham's 5-stage approach identified  in  paragraph  17  of  Razgar
       [2004] UKHL 27:


      In considering whether  a  challenge  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
           decision to remove a person must  clearly  fail,  the  reviewing
           court must, as it seems to me, consider how an appeal  would  be
           likely to fare before [the First-tier Tribunal], as the tribunal
           responsible for deciding the appeal if  there  were  an  appeal.
           This means that the reviewing court must ask itself  essentially
           the questions which would have to be answered by [the First-tier
           Tribunal Judge]. In a case where removal is resisted in reliance
           on Article 8, these questions are likely to be:

           1) Will the proposed removal be  an  interference  by  a  public
              authority with the  exercise  of  the  applicant's  right  to
              respect for his private or (as the case may be) family life?
           2) If so, will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
              gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?
           3) If so, is such interference in accordance with the law
           4) If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic society
              in the interests of national security, public safety  or  the
              economic well-being of the country,  for  the  prevention  of
              disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or
              for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?
           5) If so, is such interference proportionate to  the  legitimate
              public end sought to be achieved?

   30. Such a structured approach to the assessment of a human rights claim
       has equal force when considering Article 9 save of  course  for  the
       omission of the economic well-being  of  the  country  criterion  in
       Article 9.

The case law

   31. In El Majjaoui  &  Stichting  Touba  Moskee  v.  the  Netherlands  -
       25525/03 [2007] ECHR 1124 the Grand Chamber of the European Court of
       Human Rights considered an application by the Dutch  authorities  to
       strike out the applicant's claim to which the Court acceded.  It did
       not therefore consider that the Court was required to continue to  a
       full examination of the application. The principal applicant  was  a
       Moroccan national but the mosque (Stichting Touba Moskee)  in  which
       he worked as an imam had legal personality under Netherlands law and
       joined in the application to the ECHR.  Together, they alleged  that
       the refusal to issue a work permit to the applicant to enable him to
       work as imam for the mosque constituted an unjustified  interference
       with their right to freedom of religion as guaranteed by  Article  9
       of the Convention and was also in violation of  Article  18  of  the
       Convention.  Dutch domestic law provided that a work-permit  was  to
       be refused where there was an available supply of 'priority  labour'
       (loosely similar to the resident labour test) and if the vacancy had
       not  been  previously  notified  to  the  Dutch  equivalent  of  the
       Jobcentre.  This  latter  requirement  had  not  been  met  and,  in
       refusing the application, it was said that  insufficient  steps  had
       been taken to find priority workers to fill the vacancy.  The  Dutch
       government stated that Article 9 could not be construed as entitling
       a religious community  to  employ  as  a  teacher  and  minister  of
       religion a foreign national who did not meet statutory  requirements
       set for the purpose of preserving peace and public order, the  rough
       equivalent  of  the  public  interest  in  maintaining   immigration
       control.


   32. The Dutch government applied to strike out the claim  under  Article
       37 because in the course of the proceedings, the government informed
       the Court that a new application for a work permit on behalf of  the
       applicant had been successful; a work permit had been issued because
       the foundation  had  established  that  the  statutory  requirements
       necessary which included that the mosque had then established it had
       made sufficient efforts to fill the position  with  priority  labour
       and had notified the authorities in due form of the vacancy. Indeed,
       the applicant had been granted a residence permit.  In resisting the
       attempt to strike out the claim, the applicants relied on  the  fact
       that the principal applicant had effectively been  deprived  of  his
       work as an imam, and the local Moroccan community had been  deprived
       of an imam, until the work permit was finally issued.

   33. In its decision to strike out the claim without a full consideration
       of the merits, the Court asked itself two questions, the  second  of
       which was whether the applicants had been provided  with  sufficient
       redress.  The Court stated in paragraph 31 of its decision:

      As regards the second question, the  Court  considers  that  the  mere
           fact that the applicant foundation had to  comply  with  certain
           requirements before it was able to employ the applicant does not
           as such raise an issue under Article 9. The  Court  agrees  with
           the former Commission that that  provision  does  not  guarantee
           foreign nationals a right to obtain a residence permit  for  the
           purposes of taking up employment in a Contracting State, even if
           the employer  is  a  religious  association  (see  H�sn�  �z  v.
           Germany, no. 32168/96, Commission decision of 3 December  1996).
           After all, the Convention does not lay down for the  Contracting
           States any given manner for ensuring within their  internal  law
           the effective implementation of the Convention. The choice as to
           the most appropriate means of achieving this is in  principle  a
           matter for the  domestic  authorities,  who  are  in  continuous
           contact with the vital forces of their countries and are  better
           placed to assess the possibilities  and  resources  afforded  by
           their respective domestic  legal  systems  (see  Swedish  Engine
           Drivers' Union v. Sweden, judgment of 6 February 1976, Series A
           no. 20, p. 18, � 50; Chapman v. the United  Kingdom  [GC],  no.
           27238/95, � 91, ECHR 2001-I;  and  Sisojeva  and  Others,  cited
           above, � 90).


   34. Thus, in a somewhat oblique way in the course of an  application  to
       strike out, the ECtHR gave its view on the scope of, and limitations
       upon, the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.  The
       decision had followed the decision using its  earlier  procedure  in
       Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek v. France 27417/95 [2000] ECHR 351 in which
       a Jewish liturgical association, Cha'are Shalom Ve Tsedek, alleged a
       violation of Article 9 of the Convention on account  of  the  French
       authorities' refusal to grant it the approval necessary  for  access
       to slaughterhouses with a view to  performing  ritual  slaughter  in
       accordance with the ultra-orthodox religious  prescriptions  of  its
       members.   The  French  authorities  had  granted  approval  to   an
       organisation (the ACIP) that satisfied the majority  of  the  Jewish
       community in France but  the  applicants  were  not  satisfied  this
       resulted in the slaughtered meat being ritually pure.  In France, as
       in many other European countries, the ritual slaughter  required  by
       Jews and Muslims for religious reasons came into conflict  with  the
       principle that an animal to be slaughtered, after being  restrained,
       must first be stunned in order to spare  it  any  suffering.  Ritual
       slaughter was nevertheless authorised under  French  law  but  might
       only be performed by authorised slaughterers and the  applicant  had
       not obtained that authorisation.


   35. The Conseil d'Etat had in another earlier case held:

      In requiring ritual slaughter performed  under  conditions  derogating
           from the provisions of ordinary law to be carried  out  only  by
           ritual slaughterers authorised by religious bodies  approved  by
           the Minister of Agriculture on a proposal by the Minister of the
           Interior, the Prime Minister did not interfere in the affairs of
           religious bodies and did not infringe the freedom of worship but
           took the measures needed for  exercise  of  that  freedom  in  a
           manner consistent with public policy.

   36. The de facto monopoly enjoyed by the  ACIP  with  regard  to  ritual
       slaughter was not, however, the result of any  deliberate  intention
       on the part of the State, which would not have failed to  grant  the
       approval sought by the applicants if it had been able to prove  that
       it was essentially a religious body and had wider support within the
       Jewish community.  The fact that the exceptional rules  designed  to
       regulate  the  practice  of  ritual  slaughter  permit  only  ritual
       slaughterers authorised by approved religious bodies to engage in it
       did not in itself lead to the conclusion  that  there  has  been  an
       interference with the freedom to manifest one's religion. The  Court
       considered, like the Government, that it was in the general interest
       to  avoid  unregulated  slaughter,  carried  out  in  conditions  of
       doubtful hygiene, and that it was therefore preferable, if there  is
       to be ritual slaughter, for it to be  performed  in  slaughterhouses
       supervised by the public authorities. Importantly, the Court held:


      In the Court's opinion, there would be interference with the  freedom
           to manifest one's religion only if the illegality of  performing
           ritual slaughter made it impossible for ultra-orthodox  Jews  to
           eat  meat  from  animals  slaughtered  in  accordance  with  the
           religious prescriptions they considered applicable.

   37. That was not the case because the  applicants  would  easily  obtain
       supplies of ritually pure meat in Belgium.  Furthermore,  there  was
       evidence that a  number  of  butcher's  shops  operating  under  the
       control of the ACIP made ritually pure meat available to Jews.   Two
       strands might be detected in this decision.  First,  the  Convention
       right to freedom of thought, conscience and  religion  includes  the
       practical implementation of that belief in  the  form  of  religious
       practice or ritual (that is, it was not simply a freedom of thought)
       and secondly a distinction was drawn between circumstances where the
       domestic regulation rendered the observance of religious practice or
       ritual impossible and  those  where  practical  observance  remained
       possible,  through  constrained  by  domestic  legislation  lawfully
       imposed.

A flagrant denial or gross violation test?  Ullah and Do

   38. In Ullah and Do, R (on the Application  of)  v  Special  Adjudicator
       [2004] UKHL 26, the specific right  in  question  in  the  conjoined
       appeals was the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion
       guaranteed by Article 9 of the  Convention  and  in  particular  the
       freedom "either alone or in community with others and in  public  or
       private, to manifest his religion or belief, in  worship,  teaching,
       practice and observance".


   39. Mr Ullah had applied for asylum, claiming that, as an active  member
       of the Ahmadhiya faith, he had a well-founded fear of persecution in
       Pakistan as a result of his religious  beliefs.   His  asylum  claim
       failed.  He also relied on Article 9 but this, too, was rejected  by
       the Adjudicator.  She found that although Articles 9, 10 and  11  of
       the Convention could be engaged in a  situation  of  this  kind,  Mr
       Ullah would suffer  no  serious  infringement  of  these  rights  in
       Pakistan; the Secretary of State was acting lawfully in pursuance of
       the legitimate aim of  immigration  control;  and  his  decision  to
       remove Mr Ullah to Pakistan was proportionate to any difficulties he
       might face on his return.

   40. The other appellant, Miss Do, was a citizen of Vietnam  and  entered
       the United Kingdom in November 2000. She applied for  asylum,  based
       on her fear  of  persecution  as  a  practising  Roman  Catholic  in
       Vietnam.

   41. The House of Lords drew a  distinction  between  what  Lord  Bingham
       defined as 'domestic cases' and 'foreign  cases'  in  which  in  the
       latter category it was not claimed that the state  had  violated  or
       would violate the  applicant's  Convention  rights  within  its  own
       territory but in which it is claimed that the conduct of  the  state
       in removing a person from its territory  (whether  by  expulsion  or
       extradition) to another territory will lead to a  violation  of  the
       person's Convention rights in that other territory. Although Article
       1 of the Convention provides that the signatories  shall  secure  to
       everyone within their jurisdiction the defined rights and  freedoms,
       it sets a territorial limit on  the  reach  of  the  Convention.  In
       particular, the Convention does not  govern  the  actions  of  other
       states, nor does it require the  signatories  to  impose  Convention
       standards on other  States.  Thus,  Article  1  cannot  be  read  as
       justifying a general principle to the effect  that,  notwithstanding
       its extradition obligations, a Contracting State may  not  surrender
       an individual unless satisfied that the conditions awaiting  him  in
       the country of destination are in  full  accord  with  each  of  the
       safeguards of the Convention.


   42. Ullah and Do, as is readily apparent,  were  'foreign  cases'.   The
       Court of Appeal had concluded at paragraph 64:

      This appeal is concerned with Article 9. Our reasoning  has,  however,
           wider implications. Where the Convention is invoked on the  sole
           ground of the treatment to which an alien, refused the right  to
           enter or remain, is likely to  be  subjected  by  the  receiving
           state, and that treatment is not sufficiently severe  to  engage
           Article 3, the English court is not required to  recognise  that
           any other Article of the Convention is, or may be, engaged."

   43. The Court of Appeal ruled out as a matter  of  law  the  possibility
       that any Article other than Article 3 could  ever  be  engaged.  The
       crucial issue in the House of Lords was whether, in a foreign  case,
       reliance might be placed on any article of the Convention other than
       Article 3, and in particular  whether  reliance  may  be  placed  on
       Article 9.

   44.  Having  examined  the  nature  of  the  rights  conferred  by   the
       Convention, the House of Lords decided that the Court of Appeal  was
       in error in making the categorical statement that in  foreign  cases
       it was only Article 3 that  had  to  be  considered.   Instead,  the
       correct approach was a  more  stringent  approach,  namely,  a  test
       involving whether the returnee was at risk of a flagrant  denial  or
       gross violation.  It was this test that  had  been  adopted  by  the
       Immigration Appeal Tribunal (Mr C M G Ockelton, deputy president, Mr
       Allen and Mr Moulden) in Devaseelan v Secretary  of  State  for  the
       Home Department [2002] IAT 702, paragraph 111:

      The reason why flagrant denial or gross violation is to be taken  into
           account is that it is only in such a case - where the right will
           be completely denied or nullified in the destination  country  -
           that it  can  be  said  that  removal  will  breach  the  treaty
           obligations of the signatory  state  however  those  obligations
           might be interpreted or whatever might be said by or  on  behalf
           of the destination state.

   45. Having reviewed the case law, Lord Steyn concluded in  paragraph  50
       by stating:

      It will be apparent from the review of Strasbourg jurisprudence  that,
           where other Articles may become engaged, a high  threshold  test
           will always have to  be  satisfied.  It  will  be  necessary  to
           establish at least a real risk of a flagrant  violation  of  the
           very essence of the right before  other  Articles  could  become
           engaged.

   46. In the appeal before me, the Senior Presenting Officer, Mr  Kandola,
       relies upon the high threshold test when the  appellant  is  relying
       upon a violation of his human rights where  Article  9  is  engaged.
       This is, however, misplaced in the cases of a domestic  claim,  that
       is, a claim which is based on an allegation that  his  or  another's
       human rights will be violated in the United Kingdom by his  removal.
       Nor is it necessary to impose such a high threshold if and when  the
       test is one of proportionality because in such a case the  competing
       interests of the community at large in enforcing immigration control
       and the interests of the  individuals  or  the  religious  community
       affected can be balanced.


Discrimination


   47. Cases involving discrimination on the basis of the Convention  right
       to freedom of thought, conscience and religion offer  no  or  little
       assistance.  It is not suggested that the government  is  unlawfully
       discriminating and the AICC is certainly not doing  so.   Thus,  for
       example, Eweida v British Airways Plc [2010] EWCA Civ  80,  was  the
       well-publicised cases in which the appellant's  employer  adopted  a
       practice of not permitting jewellery to be worn and visible  at  the
       open neck of the uniform that all employees were  required  to  wear
       who had contact with the general public.  The appellant wore a cross
       at her neck.  Her attitude in doing this was severely criticised  by
       the Court of Appeal and formed part  of  an  unjustified  but  wide-
       ranging attack that her employer was anti-Christian.  The  appellant
       adopted as a principal plank of her claim the provisions of  Reg.  3
       of the Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003:


            3. Discrimination on grounds of religion or belief
            (1) For the  purposes  of  these  Regulations,  a  person  ("A")
           discriminates against another person ("B") if -
      ....
            (b) A applies to B a provision, criterion or practice  which  he
           applies or would apply  equally  to  persons  not  of  the  same
           religion or belief as B, but -
            (i) which puts or would put persons  of  the  same  religion  or
           belief as B at a  particular  disadvantage  when  compared  with
           other persons,
            (ii) which puts B at that disadvantage, and
      (iii) which A cannot show to be a proportionate means of  achieving  a
           legitimate aim.

   48. Her case failed in the Court of Appeal  but  she  succeeded  in  the
       ECtHR, (Eweida and Others v.  the  United  Kingdom  (nos.  48420/10,
       59842/10, 51671/10 and 36516/10), [2013] ECHR 37).  The case  is  of
       interest in the context of this appeal only by reason  of  the  high
       importance the Court attached to the right to  freedom  of  thought,
       conscience and religion as well as the  scope  of  the  right.   The
       reasoning is to be found in paragraphs 79-84:


      The Court  recalls  that,  as  enshrined  in  Article  9,  freedom  of
           thought, conscience and religion is one of the foundations of  a
           "democratic society" within the meaning of  the  Convention.  In
           its religious dimension it is one of  the  most  vital  elements
           that  go  to  make  up  the  identity  of  believers  and  their
           conception of  life,  but  it  is  also  a  precious  asset  for
           atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned. The pluralism
           indissociable from a democratic society, which has  been  dearly
           won over the centuries, depends on it (see Kokkinakis v. Greece,
           25 May 1993, � 31, Series A no. 260-A).
      Religious freedom is primarily a  matter  of  individual  thought  and
           conscience. This aspect of  the  right  set  out  in  the  first
           paragraph of Article 9, to hold any  religious  belief  and  to
           change religion or belief, is absolute and unqualified. However,
           as further set out in Article 9 � 1, freedom  of  religion  also
           encompasses the freedom to manifest one's belief, alone  and  in
           private but also to practice in community  with  others  and  in
           public. The manifestation of religious belief may take the  form
           of worship, teaching, practice and observance.  Bearing  witness
           in words and deeds is bound up with the existence  of  religious
           convictions (see Kokkinakis, cited above, � 31  and  also  Leyla
           ?ahin v. Turkey [GC], no. 44774/98, � 105, ECHR 2005-XI, 44 EHRR
           5). Since  the  manifestation  by  one  person  of  his  or  her
           religious belief may have an impact on others, the  drafters  of
           the Convention qualified this aspect of freedom of  religion  in
           the manner set out in Article 9 � 2.
      The right to freedom  of  thought,  conscience  and  religion  denotes
           views that attain  a  certain  level  of  cogency,  seriousness,
           cohesion and importance.
      Even where the belief  in  question  attains  the  required  level  of
           cogency and importance, it cannot be said that every  act  which
           is  in  some  way  inspired,  motivated  or  influenced  by   it
           constitutes a "manifestation" of the belief. Thus, for  example,
           acts or omissions which  do  not  directly  express  the  belief
           concerned or which are only remotely connected to a  precept  of
           faith fall outside the protection of Article 9 �  1....In  order
           to count as a "manifestation" within the meaning of  Article  9,
           the act in question must be intimately linked to the religion or
           belief. An example would be an act of worship or devotion  which
           forms part of  the  practice  of  a  religion  or  belief  in  a
           generally  recognised  form.  However,  the   manifestation   of
           religion or belief is not limited to such acts; the existence of
           a sufficiently close and direct nexus between the  act  and  the
           underlying belief must be determined on the facts of each  case.
           In particular, there is  no  requirement  on  the  applicant  to
           establish that he or she acted in fulfilment of a duty  mandated
           by the religion in question (see Cha'are  Shalom  Ve  Tsedek  v.
           France [GC], no. 27417/95, �� 73-74, ECHR 2000-VII
      ...if a person is able  to  take  steps  to  circumvent  a  limitation
           placed on his or her freedom to  manifest  religion  or  belief,
           there is no interference with the right under Article 9 � 1  and
           the limitation does not therefore require to be justified  under
           Article 9 � 2.
           According to its settled  case-law,  the  Court  leaves  to  the
           States party to the Convention a certain margin of  appreciation
           in deciding whether  and  to  what  extent  an  interference  is
           necessary. This margin of appreciation goes hand  in  hand  with
           European supervision embracing both the law  and  the  decisions
           applying it. The  Court's  task  is  to  determine  whether  the
           measures taken at national level were justified in principle and
           proportionate.


The analysis

   49. Having set out the legal principles that are engaged, it is as  well
       to recap the scope of the issues before  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
       appellant, now aged 27, had spent some 3�  years  at  a  Madrasa  in
       Afghanistan prior to his coming  to  the  United  Kingdom.   He  was
       encountered by immigration officials on 8 January 2007, aged  17  or
       18, concealed in the back  of  a  lorry  and  was  notified  of  his
       liability to be removed. His asylum claim was refused on 29 May 2007
       and his appeal rights became exhausted in October 2007. In  February
       2011, the appellant  sought  judicial  review  of  the  respondent's
       refusal to treat his further submissions as  a  fresh  claim.  Those
       were summarily refused on 1 June 2011, it  being  thought  that  the
       respondent's decision-making process had been lawful  and  that  the
       proceedings were bound to fail.  I am  now  bound  to  consider  his
       claim under Article 9.


   50. The appellant's personal claim to avoid removal  was  (and  remains)
       hampered by  this  poor  immigration  history.  Attention  therefore
       focuses on the intervention  of  the  Afghanistan  Islamic  Cultural
       Centre (AICC) and the effect that the appellant's removal will  have
       on it as an a organisation and as acting on  behalf  of  the  Afghan
       Muslim community in the United Kingdom, and London in particular.

   51. This decision requires consideration to be given  to  the  following
       elements:

        i) The AICC as a religious organisation.
       ii) The effect of  the  appellant's  positive  contribution  to  the
           Afghan Muslim community in the United Kingdom and its  interface
           with the wider community.  This positive  contribution  is,  not
           inappropriately, sometimes referred to as 'good works'.
      iii) The claim by the AICC  of  an  unlawful  interference  with  its
           freedom of choice in the selection of a minister.
       iv)  Findings  of  fact  in  relation  to  the  availability  of   a
           replacement to serve the needs of the Afghan Muslim Community in
           the event of the appellant's departure.
        v) The competing  interests  of  the  Afghan  Muslim  community  in
           retaining the presence  of  the  appellant  and  preserving  the
           benefits he provides to the community on the one  hand  and,  on
           the other, the wider community whose interests the Secretary  of
           State represents in the maintenance of a system  of  immigration
           control.


   52. I shall deal with each of these matters in turn.


The AICC as a religious organisation

   53. Judge Petherbridge was not satisfied that the AICC was  a  religious
       organisation.  I have not explored  what  material  was  before  him
       although in finding that there was a material error  of  law,  Judge
       Saini referred to the statement of Mr Hanafi and the  AICC  Chairman
       which cumulatively reflected upon whether the organisation  was  one
       that is principally or substantially religious in character, thereby
       engaging Article 9. Judge Saini found the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
       failed to have due regard to this material.


   54.  I  suspect  that  I  have  a  much  more  complete  picture.  In  a
       supplementary bundle there is a Certificate  of  Registration  of  a
       Place for Religious Worship in the registration district  of  Brent.
       The  certificate  emanates  from  the  General  Register  Office  in
       Southport and states that the premises are registered as a place  of
       meeting for religious worship  in  accordance  with  the  Places  of
       Worship Registration Act, 1855. There are also entries  provided  by
       the Charity Commission in relation to the Afghan Islamic and Culture
       Centre naming the trustees, the date of registration,  the  adoption
       of the Constitution and providing that its charitable object  is  to
       advance Islamic religion in accordance with  the  teachings  of  the
       Qu'ran and Sunnah Prophet Mohammed (S.A.W.) to the Muslim community.
       I have no doubt that  the  Judge  would  have  reached  a  different
       conclusion  had  he  seen  these   documents.   In   addition,   the
       Constitution of the AICC has been  provided,  the  object  of  which
       (alongside offering facilities for recreation  and  leisure  in  the
       interests of social welfare) is that of advancing  Islamic  religion
       to the Muslim community. There is, therefore, overwhelming  evidence
       that this is both an organisation in the sense that it  is  a  legal
       entity as well as a religious organisation.

   55. For my part,  I  would  not  regard  it  as  a  requirement  of  the
       definition of religious organisation that  the  organisation  should
       have a legal  personality.  Whilst  many  religious  communities  or
       organisations may well have a distinct legal personality, it may not
       always be the case. Some may  have  charitable  status  such  as  to
       provide them with a legal personality but not all will. However,  an
       established community  of  believers  (or,  perhaps,  non-believers)
       whose activities are organised in the sense of  having  a  group  of
       elders, a board  or  governing  committee  might  well  be  able  to
       establish that, collectively, it is an organisation  sufficient  for
       the purposes of s. 13. The purpose, I assume, of making reference to
       an organisation is that, if the organisation may properly be treated
       as a separate entity, the elders, board or  committee  are  able  to
       speak as a collective voice on behalf of the community  as  a  whole
       and thereby carry greater weight than  the  individual  members  who
       write or speak. Whilst the weight that is  to  be  attached  to  the
       voice of an organisation will depend upon the specific circumstances
       of that organisation, its membership and decision-making  capability
       (and will vary from case to case), it is reasonable that a religious
       community as a whole should have its views and interests taken  into
       account.

Good works and the appellant's activities as a benefit to the community

   56. In UE (Nigeria) & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home Department
       [2010] EWCA Civ 975, the Jjudge took into account the fact that  the
       appellants had known for many years that they had no legal status in
       the United Kingdom and had taken no steps to bring themselves to the
       attention of the authorities for two-and-a-half  years  after  their
       return from Ireland. In addition he took account of  the  effect  of
       removal on each of the  appellants  in  terms  of  their  individual
       activities: in one case as a writer, poet and  performer;  in  other
       cases on their educational progress  and  their  work  and  cultural
       activities.  The judge was not, however, prepared to  put  into  the
       balancing exercise the value of the appellants'  various  activities
       to the community in the United Kingdom.  The question for the Court
       of Appeal was whether it was relevant on any basis that  the  person
       in question is of value to the community in the  United Kingdom,  a
       value of which that community would be deprived if  he  were  to  be
       removed.


   57. Sir David Keene described this as a separate consideration from  the
       consequences for the appellant himself but concluded that it  was  a
       material and lawful factor:


      9. It should be noted that this is a different  question  from  asking
           what would be the  impact  on  the  individual  in  question  of
           removing him, even  though  that  question  also  would  involve
           considering the extent to which he may  have  been  involved  in
           community  activities.  That  latter  question  is  directed  at
           ascertaining the strength of the individual's own ties  to  this
           country and the degree, consequently, of private life  which  he
           has established here, whether in terms  of  friends,  education,
           work or leisure activities. That latter question  considers  the
           extent to which his right to private life  would  be  interfered
           with by removal, an issue which arises both under  Article  8(1)
           and then if there would be such interference again under Article
           8(2) as part of the balancing exercise. But the first  question,
           that now under scrutiny, is  dealing  with  the  effect  of  his
           removal on the community in the United Kingdom... .
      35. For my part, therefore, I conclude that it is open to  this  court
           to find that the loss of such public benefit is capable of being
           a relevant consideration when assessing the public interest side
           of proportionality under Article 8 and as a matter of  principle
           I do  so  find.  That  is  where  this  aspect  comes  into  the
           proportionality exercise.

   58. Richards LJ, though  saying  that  there  was  very  little  between
       himself and Sir David Keene on the issue, did in fact articulate the
       approach is somewhat different terms:


      40. Factors are relevant to the assessment  of  proportionality  under
           Article 8 in such a case only in so far as they impact either on
           the  weight  to  be  given  to  the  maintenance  of   effective
           immigration control  or  on  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
           individual's private life. It is not a question of dropping into
           the scales all aspects of the public  interest  for  or  against
           removal or anything that might be relevant to the exercise of  a
           discretion under the statute or Immigration Rules. It is a  more
           specific and targeted exercise.
      41. For those reasons I consider that contribution to the community is
           not a freestanding or stand-alone factor  to  be  put  into  the
           Article 8 balance as an independent  consideration  in  its  own
           right. It can affect the  balance  only  in  so  far  as  it  is
           relevant to the legitimate aim or the private life claim.
      42. It is common ground  that  community  activities  may  affect  the
           strength of the private life claim, and this was something  that
           the Immigration Judge had properly in mind in his determination.


      43. As to the other side of the balance, in  MA  (Afghanistan)  [2006]
           EWCA Civ 1440 at paragraph 28 Moses LJ suggested  that  "It  may
           well be that the benefit of the community of the work  performed
           by the applicant diminishes the weight to be given to the public
           interest in immigration control." So far as I can recall and can
           discern from the material we have been shown, that judgment  was
           not drawn to the  court's  attention,  and  the  possibility  of
           contribution to the community being factored into  the  analysis
           in that way was not explored or even raised, in RU  (Sri  Lanka)
           [2008] EWCA Civ 753. Faced with the issue in the  present  case,
           however, I would accept that the matters relied on here  by  way
           of contribution to the community are indeed capable in principle
           of affecting the weight  to  be  given  to  the  maintenance  of
           effective immigration control. I agree that that public interest
           aim can and should be viewed sufficiently widely and flexibly to
           accommodate such considerations. But they do not have as obvious
           a bearing as, for example, delay by the Secretary  of  State  in
           processing  a  claim  or  the  applicability   of   a   specific
           immigration policy favouring the applicant, and I doubt if  they
           would in practice carry a lot of weight even on  the  relatively
           favourable facts of the present case. But I do agree  that  they
           should not be excluded from consideration altogether.


   59. This line of reasoning must apply with  equal  force  to  Article  9
       cases but there is this difference: s. 13 of the  Human  Rights  Act
       provides the express requirement that in any question arising  under
       the Human Rights Act that might affect the exercise by  a  religious
       organisation  of  the  Convention  right  to  freedom  of   thought,
       conscience and religion, it  must  have  particular  regard  to  the
       importance of that right.  This is an  express  requirement  of  the
       religious community's  interests  as  distinct  from  those  of  the
       appellant.


Unlawful interference with the AICC's freedom of choice

   60. The appellant claims that the actions of the  respondent  amount  to
       interference with the AICC selection of a religious  leader.  In  so
       submitting they rely upon the decision of the  ECtHR  in  Hasan  and
       Chaush v. Bulgaria, 30985/96 [2000] ECHR 511.  This  case  concerned
       the actions of the Bulgarian government in relation to what the  two
       applicants said was the forced replacement of the leadership of  the
       Muslim religious community in Bulgaria.  One of the  applicants  was
       the Chief Mufti of the Bulgarian Muslim who claimed that  the  state
       authorities had interfered in the organisational life of the  Muslim
       community by refusing to register  its  leadership  which  had  been
       elected. The Court found that the authorities had failed  to  remain
       neutral and that led to the conclusion that they violated Article 9;
       the government had proclaimed  changes  in  the  leadership  of  the
       Muslim community which were not justified.


   61. The application of Hasan and Chaush  v.  Bulgaria,  30985/96  [2000]
       ECHR 511 does not assist the appellant in this appeal.   Whilst  the
       effect of the appellant's  removal  inevitably  has  the  effect  of
       depriving the AICC and its membership of the imam of  their  choice,
       this was not the motive of  the  respondent's  actions  (unlike  the
       motive of  the  Bulgarian  authorities  which  was  to  deprive  the
       applicant  of  his  position).   In  contrast,  the  United  Kingdom
       authorities were applying immigration law as  they  saw  it  to  be.
       Even if they were wrong, the decision had not  interfered  with  the
       freedom of choice of  the  Afghan  Muslim  community  because  their
       actions have not been prompted by a wish to  favour  one  imam  over
       another. The personality of the appellant  has  not  influenced  the
       decision: anybody in the same position as the appellant who does not
       meet the requirements of the Rules is likely to be refused.


The availability to the Afghan Muslim Community of finding a replacement


   62. It must be noted that the appellant and, more importantly, the  AICC
       and the worshipping community served by the appellant have a  lawful
       route available to secure the care of the appellant or another imam.
        The requirements or attributes for Tier 2 (Ministers  of  Religion)
       Migrants are set out in Appendix A to the Immigration Rules.  I have
       set out the Rules as an appendix to this decision.  In essence  they
       provide for a valid  Certificate  of  Sponsorship  in  circumstances
       where the sponsor must confirm that the applicant is being sponsored
       to perform religious duties of a nature specified; confirms that the
       applicant will receive pay and conditions as  specified;  meets  the
       requirements of the resident labour  market  test;  establishes  the
       applicant is qualified to do the job  in  respect  of  which  he  is
       seeking leave as a minister  of  religion  and  demonstrates,  where
       necessary, that a national recruitment search was undertaken.


   63. The  appellant  will  himself,  of  course,  face  the  prospect  of
       mandatory refusal  of  entry  clearance  or  leave  to  remain  most
       obviously under paragraph 320(7B).  Whilst the appellant  will  face
       real practical difficulties in making an out-of-country  application
       for entry clearance as a minister of religion, this  arises  because
       of his own poor immigration record, compounded  by  his  failure  to
       mitigate his position by  a  voluntary  return.   Nevertheless,  the
       option of returning to  Afghanistan  and  making  an  out-of-country
       application for entry clearance is reasonable  in  the  case  of  an
       individual who has no right to enter or remain  in  accordance  with
       Chikwamba principles, Chikwamba v Secretary of State  for  the  Home
       Department [2008]  UKHL  40.   Such  a  person  cannot  advance  the
       argument that his immigration history  renders  it  unreasonable  to
       require an out-of-country application  because  he  is  at  risk  of
       refusal by reason of past  breaches  of  immigration  law.  Were  it
       otherwise, the reasonable requirement to regularise an  individual's
       immigration status by an out-of-country application would favour  an
       individual with a poor immigration history at the expense of  others
       because his application is more  likely  to  fail.   This  principle
       affects both the Article 9  consideration  of  the  appellant's  own
       claim as well as the consideration that  must  be  afforded  to  the
       rights of the religious organisation.

The appellant's personal claim to avoid removal

   64. For the reasons I have given, the  AICC,  whose  interests  are  co-
       extensive with the Muslim worshipping community in the  Centre  and,
       more generally, in London is entitled to  due  consideration  as  an
       organisation and through its collective membership.  The community's
       interest is distinct from the appellant's personal claim seeking  to
       avoid removal on proportionality  grounds.   Given  the  appellant's
       immigration history, for which he is  responsible,  the  appellant's
       personal claim to avoid removal is easily out-weighed by the  public
       interest  in  enforcing  immigration  controls  either   where   the
       individual does not  meet  the  requirements  to  remain  under  the
       Immigration Rules or where the individual is an illegal  entrant  or
       overstayer or otherwise in breach of immigration law.   There is  no
       doubt an  interference  sufficient  to  engage  Article  9  but  the
       interference is in accordance with  the  law  and  is  necessary  to
       provide the sanction of removal in the case of illegal entrants  and
       overstayers and/or to  discourage  others  who  enter  illegally  or
       extend their stay unlawfully.  As a result of his  poor  immigration
       history and the legitimate  process  of  seeking  his  removal,  the
       appellant's personal claim  to  remain  is  extremely  weak  and  is
       clearly outweighed by the wider public interest engaged  by  Article
       9.  He will be free to practice his  religion  without  any  obvious
       constraint when he returns to Afghanistan and he  cannot  claim  the
       right to practice it  in  the  United  Kingdom  notwithstanding  his
       breaches of immigration law.

The Communities' interest in the exercise of proportionality

   65. I use the term 'Communities' (in  the  plural)  because  the  appeal
       engages the interest of two communities: the relevant Afghan  Muslim
       community on the one hand, whose  interests  have  been  extensively
       articulated in the wealth of the supporting  material  and,  on  the
       other, the wider community whose interests the  Secretary  of  State
       represents but in circumstances where that  interest  is  less  well
       articulated (in the sense that  it  is  not  expressed  by  personal
       letters or expressions of opinion).  However, the  public  at  large
       has an interest in maintaining a system of immigration control  that
       distinguishes between those entitled to remain and  others  and,  in
       the case of the latter, provides a means of removal without  thereby
       infringing protected rights, including the right to right to freedom
       of thought, conscience and religion.  This appeal therefore raises a
       proportionality balance to be exercised between  one  community  and
       another.


   66. The general principle that such a body as the AICC is  not  entitled
       to employ as a teacher and minister of religion a  foreign  national
       who does not meet the statutory requirements properly identified  as
       forming part of  the  public  interest  in  maintaining  immigration
       control was not disputed by the ECtHR in  El  Majjaoui  &  Stichting
       Touba Moskee v. the Netherlands.  Article 9  does  not  guarantee  a
       foreign national the right to obtain permission to reside in another
       country even for the purpose of working as  a  religious  leader  or
       teacher. The domestic authorities have a margin of  appreciation  in
       setting the rules that permit (or prevent) entry or leave to  remain
       for such purposes, see paragraph 31 of El Majjaoui,  cited  in  [21]
       above.

   67. The Immigration Rules cannot properly be construed as  a  deliberate
       attempt to stifle  the  free  exercise  of  the  practice  of  their
       religion by the AICC and  Afghan  Muslim  community  in  the  United
       Kingdom and London in particular. The Rules  (see  the  appendix  to
       this determination which sets out the material provisions  in  full)
       are permissive and allow ministers of religion to enter  and  remain
       subject to reasonable conditions as to the terms of their employment
       and the protection of the resident labour market.

   68. I recognise that it is not permissible in the implementation of  the
       Rules  (notwithstanding  the  fact  that   they   normally   operate
       consistently with Article 9) to make the free exercise of religion a
       practical impossibility. Thus in  the  case  of  Cha'are  Shalom  Ve
       Tsedek v. France if a religious community genuinely needed  meat  to
       have been ritually slaughtered in a way prevented by  domestic  law,
       the prescription contained in domestic law would be a  violation  of
       their Article 9 rights.

   69. I would however regard the general  principle  referred  to  in  the
       preceding paragraph to be subject to reasonable  limitations.  Thus,
       the practice which is said to be made impossible must have  obtained
       a  sufficient  level  of   'cogency,   seriousness,   cohesion   and
       importance' (to adopt the expression used by  the  ECtHR)  to  merit
       protection notwithstanding its contravening domestic law.  I suggest
       this means that alterations to traditional practice brought about by
       domestic laws (for example, hygiene or health  and  safety)  do  not
       demand protection but only do so when the prohibition  goes  to  the
       core of what it means to the individual to be a Muslim, a Hindu or a
       Christian.

   70. In the context of this appellant the functions that he performs (and
       which his removal would prevent occurring) must reach a  level  such
       that the AICC or its membership cannot properly function without him
       as a worshipping Muslim community.

   71. It must be noted that, in  the  context  of  a  religious  community
       transplanted into another  country  by  the  process  of  migration,
       religious  practices  often  or  always   adapt   to   the   changed
       environment. Thus, for example,  the  practice  of  cremating  human
       remains  in  ghats  and  committing  the  ashes  to  the  Ganges  is
       inevitably different in the diaspora and  practice  has  changed  to
       reflect that difference.

   72. The issue in this appeal, therefore, is whether it is impossible for
       the Afghan religious community to operate in accordance  with  their
       religious  beliefs  and  practices  without  the  presence  of   the
       appellant.  In addressing this issue, the Tribunal must be alive  to
       the possibility that, in  seeking  to  retain  the  appellant  as  a
       religious worker, the community may formulate a job description that
       effectively excludes any applicant  save  the  claimant.  Thus,  for
       example,  a  job  description  for  an  individual  to  replace  the
       appellant might prescribe the following requirements:

            The applicant must be a male, aged between 25 and 30,  and  have
           been in the United Kingdom for at least eight years.  He must be
           a Hafiz and speak Pashtu and Dari. He must have  had  experience
           in teaching in  a  Madrasa  and  have  experience  in  community
           building. He must have a charismatic personality  and  have  the
           respect of the Afghan Muslim community as a whole.  He  must  be
           able to deal with Embassy functions.

   73. There is a marked similarity between this description  of  the  work
       that the appellant has described doing and the advertisement which I
       have set out in paragraph  [14]  above.  The  AICC  claim  that  the
       appellant is uniquely able to perform the functions  they  wish  and
       that attempts to advertise for a replacement have failed to  produce
       a suitable candidate. Caution should be exercised  when  considering
       the weight to be attached to the responses to an advertisement.   If
       the job description is tailored to the specific attributions of  the
       appellant, it will not be surprising that only the appellant himself
       will readily qualify.  It should be remembered  that  the  applicant
       himself would not have qualified for the job if he  had  been  faced
       with the same criteria as those set out in paragraph  [14]  when  he
       started working for the AICC in 2007.


   74. I have concluded that the AICC has  failed  to  establish  that  the
       Afghan  Muslim  community  cannot  operate  without  the   continued
       presence of the appellant.  First, it is  accepted  that  there  are
       some 56,000 Muslim Afghans in the United Kingdom and  this  provides
       an adequate source of suitable  alternative  candidates,  albeit  an
       individual may not presently have the same experience and  qualities
       as the appellant.

   75.  Second,  the  Immigration  Rules  do  not  prevent  the  AICC  from
       recruiting a suitable applicant from abroad.

   76. Third, it is not necessary  that  the  various  functions  currently
       performed by the applicant continue to  be  performed  by  a  single
       person. If he performs several roles,  it  is  not  a  violation  of
       Article 9 that those roles are carried out by several  others.  This
       is so even if it is more costly and less convenient to  use  several
       individuals.

   77. Fourth,  it  cannot  reasonably  be  said  that  the  Afghan  Muslim
       community in the UK would cease to continue as a religious community
       were the appellant to be removed. The community operated without his
       presence prior to 2007.  The appellant has only been in  the  United
       Kingdom since then, when he arrived aged 17 or 18, having spent some
       3� years at a Madrasa. His undoubted popularity and ability must  be
       the result, in part at least, of his  growing  experience  developed
       over time. Hence it cannot be a violation of Article 9 if  the  AICC
       were placed in the position that a less experienced religious worker
       has to be retained. This merely replicates the position in which the
       AICC must have found themselves when the applicant joined them.

   78. Finally, it  cannot  reasonably  be  said  that  the  Afghan  Muslim
       community in the United Kingdom would similarly face the prospect of
       the  practical  inability  to  practice  their  religion  were   the
       appellant to die or become so seriously  ill  as  to  be  unable  to
       continue his work or if the appellant himself decided to leave.   If
       that is correct as it relates  to  a  cessation  of  his  activities
       brought about by circumstances beyond the control of the AICC or its
       members, it must also apply in the case of an enforced removal.

Conclusion

   79. It is inevitable in  an  application  of  this  nature,  as  I  have
       suggested in paragraph 47 above, that the evidence will be  directed
       towards reasons why the appellant should not be removed. This is all
       the more so when the religious  organisation  is  articulate,  well-
       educated, committed and focused. Their  support  does  them  credit.
       However, their claim leaves out of the account  the  fact  that  the
       appellant is an illegal entrant and an overstayer.

   80. I have no doubt that the public interest criteria  which  come  into
       play have to be assessed having regard to the views of the AICC  and
       its members. In doing so, I  accept  that  in  accordance  with  the
       judgment   of   Richard's   LJ   in   UE   (Nigeria)   &    Ors    v
       Secretary of State for the Home Department the benefit  to  the
       community of the work  performed  diminishes  the  weight  given  to
       immigration control. Nevertheless, it would be a curious result  if,
       as a result of a petition containing 1000 signatures, the system  of
       United Kingdom law and regulation were to be  suspended.  That  does
       not mean those who petition  should  not  influence  legislators  or
       local councillors or decision makers. Their views  should  be  taken
       into account. That however is a far cry  from  claiming  that  their
       views should be determinative or, indeed, very influential; all  the
       more so when the interest they  represent  is  local,  perhaps  even
       parochial.

   81. For these reasons I  am  satisfied  that  notwithstanding  the  keen
       interest  shown  by  the  AICC  and  its  membership   (itself   and
       collectively) in retaining the appellant, the public interest in his
       removal outweighs it. I accept his positive place in  the  community
       diminishes the public interest in his removal. I also accept that it
       is comparatively rare for any  community  (not  simply  a  religious
       community) to rally round and offer such vocal support to an illegal
       immigrant and overstayer. However, for the reasons I have given,  it
       is not easy to attach significant weight  to  a  section  of  public
       opinion such as to render it a proportionate  response  to  make  an
       exception to the operation of the Immigration Rules.  Although  this
       is an Article 9 claim, based on the right  to  freedom  of  thought,
       conscience and religion, I do not  regard  that  it  operates  in  a
       markedly different way from  the  proportionality  exercise  in  the
       related Article 8 case or that, in doing so, it favours the AICC and
       its members on the issue of Article 9 proportionality.

DECISION

      The Judge made an  error  on  a  point  of  law  and  I  substitute  a
determination dismissing the appeal on all the grounds advanced.

Appendix A



Attributes for Tier 2 (Ministers of Religion) Migrants


   85. An applicant applying for entry clearance or leave  to  remain  as  a
   Tier  2  (Ministers  of  Religion)  Migrant  must  score  50  points  for
   attributes.
   86. Available points are shown in Table 12 below.
   87. Notes to accompany Table 12 appear below that table.







Table 12

|Criterion         |Poin|
|                  |ts  |
|Certificate of    |50  |
|Sponsorship       |    |


Notes

   88. In order to obtain points for sponsorship, the applicant will need to
   provide a valid Certificate  of  Sponsorship  reference  number  in  this
   category.
   89. A Certificate of Sponsorship reference number will only be considered
   to be valid for the purposes of this sub-category if:
        (a) the number supplied  links  to  a  Certificate  of  Sponsorship
        Checking Service entry that names the applicant as the Migrant  and
        confirms that the sponsor is sponsoring him as a Tier  2  (Minister
        of Religion) Migrant, and
        (b) the Sponsor is an A-rated Sponsor, unless:
              (1) the application is for leave to remain, and
              (2) the applicant has, or was last granted, leave as a Tier 2
              (Minister of  Religion)  Migrant,  a  Minister  of  Religion,
              Missionary or Member of a Religious Order, and
              (3) the applicant is applying to work for the  same  employer
              named on the Certificate of Sponsorship which led to his last
              grant of leave or, in the case of  an  applicant  whose  last
              grant of leave was as a Minister of Religion,  Missionary  or
              Member of a Religious Order, the same employer for  whom  the
              applicant was working or stated he was intending to work when
              last granted leave.
   90. The  sponsor  must  have  assigned  the  Certificate  of  Sponsorship
   reference number to  the  migrant  no  more  than  3  months  before  the
   application is made and the reference number must not have been cancelled
   by the Sponsor or by the United Kingdom Border Agency since then.
   91. The migrant must not previously have  applied  for  entry  clearance,
   leave to  enter  or  leave  to  remain  using  the  same  Certificate  of
   Sponsorship reference number, if that application was either approved  or
   refused (not  rejected  as  an  invalid  application,  declared  void  or
   withdrawn).
   92. In addition, the Certificate of Sponsorship  Checking  Service  entry
   must:
        (a) confirm that  the  applicant  is  being  sponsored  to  perform
        religious duties, which:
              (i) must be work which is within the Sponsor's  organisation,
              or directed by the Sponsor's organisation,
              (ii) may include preaching, pastoral work  and  non  pastoral
              work,
              (iii) must not involve mainly non-pastoral  duties,  such  as
              school  teaching,  media  production,   domestic   work,   or
              administrative or clerical work, unless the role is a  senior
              position in the Sponsor's organisation, and
        (b) provide an outline of the duties in (a),
        (c) if the Sponsor's organisation is  a  religious  order,  confirm
        that the applicant is a member of that order,
        (d) confirm that the applicant will receive pay and  conditions  at
        least equal to those given to settled workers  in  the  same  role,
        that the remuneration complies with  or  is  exempt  from  National
        Minimum Wage regulations, and provide details of the remuneration,
        (e) confirm that the requirements of  the  resident  labour  market
        test, as set out in paragraph 92A below, in  respect  of  the  job,
        have been complied with, unless the applicant is applying for leave
        to remain and the Sponsor is the same Sponsor as in his last  grant
        of leave,
        (f) confirm that the migrant:
              (i) is qualified to do the job in  respect  of  which  he  is
              seeking leave as a Tier 2 (Minister of Religion) Migrant,
              (ii) intends to base himself in the UK, and
              (iii) will comply with the conditions of his  leave,  if  his
              application is successful, and
        (g) confirm that the  Sponsor  will  maintain  or  accommodate  the
        migrant.
   92A. To confirm that the Resident Labour Market Test has been  passed  or
   the role is exempt from the test, and  for  points  to  be  awarded,  the
   Certificate of Sponsorship Checking Service entry must confirm:
        1. (a) That the role is supernumerary, such that  it  is  over  and
           above the Sponsor's normal  staffing  requirements  and  if  the
           person filling the role was not there, it would not need  to  be
           filled by anyone else, with a full  explanation  of  why  it  is
           supernumerary; or
           (b) That the role involves living  mainly  within  and  being  a
           member of  a  religious  order,  which  must  be  a  lineage  of
           communities or of people who live in some  way  set  apart  from
           society in accordance with their  specific  religious  devotion,
           for example an order of nuns or monks; or
           (c) That the Sponsor holds national  records  of  all  available
           individuals, details of those records and confirmation that  the
           records show that no suitable settled  worker  is  available  to
           fill the role; or
           (d) That a national recruitment search was undertaken, including
        the      following details:
              (i) Where the role was advertised, which must be at least one
              of the following:
                    (1)  a  national  form  of  media  appropriate  to   the
                    Sponsor's religion or denomination,
                    (2) the Sponsor's  own  website,  if  that  is  how  the
                    Sponsor usually  reaches  out  to  its  community  on  a
                    national scale, that is  where  it  normally  advertises
                    vacant  positions,  and   the   pages   containing   the
                    advertisement  are  free  to  view  without   paying   a
                    subscription fee or making a donation, or
                    (3) Jobcentre Plus (or in  Northern  Ireland,  JobCentre
                    Online) or in  the  employment  section  of  a  national
                    newspaper, if there is  no  suitable  national  form  of
                    media  appropriate  to   the   Sponsor's   religion   or
                    denomination;
                 (ii) any reference numbers of the advertisements;
                 (iii) the period the role was advertised for,  which  must
                 include  at  least  28  days  during  the  6  month  period
                 immediately  before  the  date  the  Sponsor  assigned  the
                 Certificate of Sponsorship to the applicant; and
                 (iv) confirmation that no  suitable  settled  workers  are
                 available to be recruited for the role;  or  the  applicant
                 must be applying for leave to remain and the  Sponsor  must
                 be the same Sponsor as in his last grant of leave.
