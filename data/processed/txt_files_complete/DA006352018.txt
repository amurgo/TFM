                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

1.    By a decision dated 27 May 2020, made under Rule 34  of  the  Tribunal
      Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 on  the  papers  and  without  a
      hearing ("the Decision"), I found an error of law in the  decision  of
      First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Davey  promulgated  on  3  January   2020
      dismissing the Appellant's appeal.  The Decision is annexed hereto for
      ease of reference. The resumed hearing before me took place  prior  to
      the recent judgment in JCWI v The  President  of  the  Upper  Tribunal
      (IAC) [2020] EWHC 3103 (Admin) dealing  with  the  unfairness  of  the
      determination of appeals without a hearing.  However,  in  this  case,
      the Appellant has benefitted from the Decision since it set aside  the
      dismissal of his appeal and was therefore in  his  favour.   Moreover,
      both parties had the opportunity to reargue their case at the  hearing
      before me.
2.    The hearing before me took place via Skype for Business.   There  were
      some minor  difficulties  with  the  giving  and  taking  of  evidence
      remotely, particularly  since  two  of  the  witnesses  gave  evidence
      remotely via interpreters.  However, those witnesses managed  to  give
      their evidence in a coherent manner via that medium and I am satisfied
      from their answers that they were  understood  by  me  and  the  legal
      representatives.  Neither party indicated  that  they  considered  the
      hearing to have been unfair.

3.    An issue arose at the outset of the hearing as one of the  Appellant's
      witnesses, his sister, Julija Olsanskaja, had returned to Lithuania in
      the previous week and was not therefore present in the UK at the  time
      of the hearing.  She joined the hearing remotely  from  Lithuania  and
      was ready to give evidence if needed.  However, Ms Cunha cautioned  me
      against receiving evidence from abroad  in  this  manner  without  any
      indication that Ms Olsanskaja had the  permission  of  the  Lithuanian
      authorities to give evidence to a Tribunal in the UK in  this  manner.
      I have regard to the Tribunal's decision Nare (evidence by  electronic
      means)  Zimbabwe  [2011]  UKUT  00443  (IAC)  at  [21(d)].   Although,
      obviously the pandemic has changed the Tribunal's general  willingness
      to take oral evidence via remote means (at least for so  long  as  the
      current situation prevails), that does not alter the point made  about
      ensuring that diplomatic relations are not  upset  by  the  taking  of
      evidence from within the jurisdiction of another nation.

 4.         The problem was not in this case insurmountable since  Ms  Cunha
      had only one question for this witness.  I agreed therefore  that  the
      question would be put to the witness via  the  Appellant's  solicitors
      who could then  provide  the  answer  by  way  of  instructions  or  a
      clarificatory statement.  I gave the Appellant  seven  days  following
      the hearing in order to provide that answer. I have not  received  any
      further information.  I take that  into  account  when  assessing  the
      evidence of Ms Olsanskaja.

5.          I also gave the Appellant seven days to provide evidence to  the
      Tribunal as to the reasons for the non-attendance of  the  Appellant's
      wife, Ms Laura Pashaeva, as a witness.  It had been expected that  she
      would attend remotely.  However, I was informed by the  Appellant  who
      made contact with her during the hearing to ascertain her  whereabouts
      that she was unable to attend as  she  felt  unwell.   Again,  I  have
      received no explanation for  her  failure  to  attend  and  therefore,
      again, I take that into account when assessing the weight to be  given
      to her evidence as well as to the relationship  between  her  and  the
      Appellant.

6.          Another of the Appellant's witnesses, Mr Richard Smith,  is  the
      director (as I understand it) of a company  called  Kensington  Guards
      Inc Ltd.  The Appellant used to do work for that  company.   Mr  Smith
      had been  expected  to  give  evidence  remotely,  but  the  Appellant
      indicated that,  due  to  the  delays  in  reaching  that  gentleman's
      evidence, he had to leave the hearing in order to  work.   I  did  not
      consider  it  appropriate  to  adjourn  since  that  gentleman's  oral
      evidence would have been of limited if any benefit particularly  since
      the Appellant himself was able to give  evidence  about  his  previous
      employment and job prospects in the future.

7.           I  received  in  evidence  a  composite  bundle   of   evidence
      consisting of the Appellant's bundle and supplementary bundle for  the
      First-tier Tribunal hearing and evidence adduced for this hearing.   I
      refer to that below as [AB/tab reference/page reference)]. In relation
      to the additional evidence adduced for this hearing,  that  was  filed
      under cover of an application notice seeking permission to adduce  it.
       My earlier  directions  gave  permission  to  rely  on  some  further
      evidence adduced with the grounds.  There  was  no  objection  by  the
      Respondent to the admission of the further  evidence  and,  given  the
      need to consider the up-to-date position, I considered it  appropriate
      to admit it.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

8.          As indicated in the Decision, the Appellant  is  a  national  of
      Lithuania. Although there was some dispute  as  to  the  date  of  the
      Appellant's entry to the UK, Judge Davey found at [12] to [14] of  his
      decision that the Appellant entered as he claimed in 2004.  I  see  no
      reason to disturb that finding  and  no  challenge  was  made  to  the
      Appellant's evidence at the hearing before me as to the date of entry.



9.          However, the period of residence  has  limited  bearing  on  the
      Appellant's case if, as I indicated at [29]  of  the  Decision  I  was
      minded to  do,  I  also  preserve  Judge  Davey's  finding  that  such
      integrative links as the Appellant has built up in the UK were  broken
      by his imprisonment.  That finding was not challenged by the Appellant
      in his grounds of appeal to  this  Tribunal.   I  am  invited  by  the
      Appellant to revisit that finding in light of the further evidence.  I
      will consider that submission in due  course  based  on  the  evidence
      before me.

10.         As I also  concluded  at  [29]  of  the  Decision,  though,  the
      Appellant has shown that he has been continuously  resident  for  five
      years prior to his imprisonment and has therefore established that  he
      is permanently resident.  As I there note that issue was  conceded  by
      the Respondent, even prior to Judge Davey's decision (and in fact  the
      Judge's failure to expressly recognise that fact was the reason for my
      finding that there was an error of law in his decision).  Accordingly,
      as I come to below, the Respondent has to show that there are  serious
      grounds for believing that the Appellant is  a  genuine,  present  and
      sufficiently serious threat to public policy and  public  security  in
      the UK.

11.         The other major factors to be  considered  are  the  Appellant's
      private and family life in the UK and the extent of the risk he  poses
      (which also incorporates the extent  to  which  he  has  rehabilitated
      himself and  his  future  prospects  of  rehabilitation  here  and  in
      Lithuania).  The Appellant also suffers from health  conditions,  some
      of which appear to have been caused  or  contributed  to  by  previous
      misuse of drugs and alcohol.  The Appellant's alcoholism is also  said
      to be the main cause of his offending.

12.         By way of background to the Appellant's life in the UK  are  his
      relationships with his wife (from whom he is estranged) and his son as
      well as his mother, sister  and  other  relatives  in  the  UK.    The
      Appellant's son [E] was born in 2012.

13.         As to the risk which the Appellant poses, the index  offence  is
      a  conviction  on  20  August  2018  at  Chelmsford  Crown  Court   of
      wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm for which the  Appellant  was
      sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.  However,  there  have  also
      been a significant number of previous offences between the period 2005
      to March 2018 when the index offence was committed.  I will come on to
      the detail of those offences below when dealing with the evidence.

14.         The sentence for the  index  offence  triggered  the  notice  of
      liability to deportation dated 2 October 2018 (at [AB/C/19-43]).  By a
      supplementary letter dated  10  October  2018  (at  [AB/C/44-45])  the
      Respondent  conceded  that  the  Appellant  had   acquired   permanent
      residence in the UK but  continued  to  assert  that  deportation  was
      justified on serious grounds.

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

15.         The legislation which forms the legal framework in this case  is
      the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2016  ("the  EEA
      Regulations").

16.         Regulation 27 of the EEA Regulations reads as follows so far  as
      relevant:

                 "Decisions  taken  on  grounds  of  public  policy,  public
      security and public health
            27. - (1) In this regulation, a 'relevant decision' means an EEA
           decision taken on the grounds of public policy, public  security
           or public health.
                 (2)   A  relevant  decision  may  not  be  taken  to  serve
      economic ends.
            (3)  A relevant decision may  not  be  taken  in  respect  of  a
           person with a right of permanent residence under  regulation  15
           except on serious grounds of public policy and public security.
           (4) A relevant decision may not be taken except  on  imperative
           grounds of public security in respect of an EEA national who-
           (a) has a right of permanent residence under regulation 15 and
           who has resided in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of
           at least ten years prior to the relevant decision; or
           ...
            (5)  The public policy and public security requirements  of  the
           United Kingdom include restricting rights otherwise conferred by
           these Regulations in order to protect the fundamental  interests
           of society, and where a relevant decision is taken on grounds of
           public policy or public  security  it  must  also  be  taken  in
           accordance with the following principles -
                       (a)   the decision must comply with the principle  of
      proportionality;
            (b)  the decision must be  based  exclusively  on  the  personal
                 conduct of the person concerned;
            (c)  the  personal  conduct  of  the  person  must  represent  a
                 genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  affecting
                 one of the fundamental interests of  society,  taking  into
                 account past conduct of the person and that the threat does
                 not need to be imminent;
            (d)  matters isolated from the particulars of the case or  which
                 relate to  considerations  of  general  prevention  do  not
                 justify the decision;
             (e)   a  person's  previous  criminal  convictions  do  not  in
                 themselves justify the decision;
            (f)  the decision may be taken on preventative grounds, even  in
                 the absence of a previous criminal conviction, provided the
                 grounds are specific to the person.

            (6)  Before taking a relevant decision on the grounds of  public
           policy and public security in relation to a person ("P") who  is
           resident in the United Kingdom, the  decision  maker  must  take
           account of considerations such as  the  age,  state  of  health,
           family and economic situation of P, P's length of  residence  in
           the United Kingdom, P's social and cultural integration into the
           United Kingdom and the extent of P's links with P's  country  of
           origin.
                 (7)   ...
            (8)  A court or tribunal considering  whether  the  requirements
           of his regulation are met must (in particular)  have  regard  to
           the considerations contained in Schedule  1  (considerations  of
           public policy, public security and the fundamental interests  of
           society, etc.)"

17.         Schedule 1 to the EEA Regulations provides as follows so far  as
      relevant:

                 "SCHEDULE 1
             CONSIDERATIONS  OF  PUBLIC  POLICY,  PUBLIC  SECURITY  AND  THE
           FUNDAMENTAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY ETC.
                 Considerations of public policy and public security
           1. The EU Treaties do not  impose  a  uniform  scale  of  public
              policy or public  security  values:  member  States  enjoy  a
              considerable discretion, acting within the parameters set  by
              the EU Treaties, applied where relevant by the EEA agreement,
              to define their own standards of  public  policy  and  public
              security, for purposes tailored to their individual contexts,
              from time to time.
           Application of paragraph 1 to the United Kingdom
           2. An EEA national or the  family  member  of  an  EEA  national
              having extensive familial and societal links with persons  of
              the  same  nationality  or  language  does  not   amount   to
              integration in the United Kingdom; a  significant  degree  of
              wider cultural  and  societal  integration  must  be  present
              before a person may be regarded as integrated in  the  United
              Kingdom.
           3. Where an EEA national or the family member of an EEA national
              has  received  a  custodial  sentence,  or  is  a  persistent
              offender, the longer the sentence, or the more  numerous  the
              convictions, the greater the likelihood that the individual's
              continued  presence  in  the  United  Kingdom  represents   a
              genuine, present and sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting
              one of the fundamental interests of society.
           4. Little weight is to be attached to the integration of an  EEA
              national or the family member of an EEA national  within  the
              United Kingdom if the alleged integrating links  were  formed
              at or around the same time as -
                 a) the commission of a criminal offence;
                 b) an act otherwise affecting the fundamental interests  of
                    society;
                 c) the EEA national or family member of an EEA national was
                    in custody.
           5. The removal from the United Kingdom of an EEA national or the
              family member of an EEA  national  who  is  able  to  provide
              substantive evidence  of  not  demonstrating  a  threat  (for
              example, through demonstrating that the EEA national  or  the
              family member of an EEA national has successfully reformed or
              rehabilitated) is less likely to be proportionate.
           6. ...
                 The fundamental interests of society
           7. For  the  purposes  of  these  Regulations,  the  fundamental
              interests of society in the United Kingdom include -
                 a) ...;
                 b) maintaining public order;
                 c) preventing social harm;
                 d) preventing the evasion of tax and duties;
                 e) protecting public services;
                 f) excluding or removing an EEA national or  family  member
                    of an EEA national with a  conviction  (including  where
                    the conduct of that person is likely to cause, or has in
                    fact caused,  public  offence)  and  maintaining  public
                    confidence in the ability of the relevant authorities to
                    take such action;
                 g) tackling offences likely to cause harm to society  where
                    an immediate  or  direct  victim  may  be  difficult  to
                    identify but where there is wider societal harm (such as
                    offences related to the misuse of drugs or crime with  a
                    cross-border dimension as mentioned in Article 83(1)  of
                    the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union);
                 h)  combating   the   effects   of   persistent   offending
                    (particularly in relation to offences, which if taken in
                    isolation,  may  otherwise  be  unlikely  to  meet   the
                    requirements of regulation 27);
                 i)  protecting  the  rights   and   freedoms   of   others,
                    particularly from exploitation and trafficking;
                 j) protecting the public;
                 k) acting in the best interests of a child (including where
                    doing so entails  refusing  a  child  admission  in  the
                    United Kingdom, or  otherwise  taking  an  EEA  decision
                    against a child);
                 l) ...."


18.         The essential questions for me  therefore  are,  first,  whether
      there are serious grounds for considering that the Appellant  poses  a
      genuine, present and sufficiently serious risk to public policy and/or
      public security (and, if I am persuaded  that  I  should  re-open  the
      earlier finding in relation to integrative links being broken, whether
      there are imperative grounds) and, second, even if the Appellant  does
      continue to pose such a risk, whether  deportation  is  proportionate.
      The Appellant also submits that I  need  to  consider  the  respective
      prospects  of  the  Appellant's  rehabilitation  in  the  UK  and   in
      Lithuania.  It is  asserted  that  the  weight  to  be  given  to  the
      respective prospects of rehabilitation is affected by  the  length  of
      his legal residence (Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v
      Dumliauskas & others [2015] EWCA Civ 145 at [46]).




CONSIDERATION OF THE EVIDENCE

19.         I  heard  evidence  from  the  Appellant,  his  mother,  Tatjana
      Molcanova, and the Appellant's  friend,  Ms  Tsvetanka  Drankova.   Ms
      Drankova gave evidence via a Bulgarian interpreter.   The  Appellant's
      mother gave evidence via a Russian interpreter.   The  Appellant  gave
      his evidence in English.

Risk Posed by the Appellant and Rehabilitation

20.         The Appellant was first convicted on 21 December 2005  of  theft
      (in the form of shoplifting) occurring on 11 July 2005.  That  offence
      therefore occurred after about one year  of  him  coming  to  the  UK.
      There  then  followed  seven  similar  offences.   The  Appellant  was
      sentenced to financial penalties, terms of unpaid work  and  suspended
      prison sentences.

21.         On 2 May 2007, the Appellant was convicted of having an  article
      with a sharply pointed blade in a public place, that offence occurring
      at the same time as one of his shoplifting offences on 30 April  2007.
      The Appellant was sentenced to a term of 12 weeks in prison which  was
      suspended and a term of unpaid work.

22.         On 30 January 2008, the Appellant  was  convicted  of  making  a
      false representation to make a gain for himself or another or to cause
      loss to another or  expose  another  person  to  risk.   That  offence
      occurred on 28 January 2008.  The Appellant pleaded guilty and pleaded
      guilty also to a breach of his suspended sentence.  He  was  sentenced
      to a term of imprisonment of 16 weeks with a consecutive  term  of  12
      weeks for breach of the suspended sentence imposed on 2 May 2007.

23.         On 11 July 2008, the Appellant was again convicted of  having  a
      knife or other sharp pointed article in a public place,  that  offence
      occurring on 16 January 2008. He pleaded guilty and was  sentenced  to
      three months in prison.

24.         On 23 July  2008,  the  Appellant  was  convicted  and  given  a
      conditional discharge in relation to a charge of possessing heroin.

25.          On  17  March  2009,  the  Appellant  was  convicted  of  using
      disorderly behaviour or threatening/abusive/insulting words likely  to
      cause harassment, alarm or distress in relation to an  offence  on  16
      March 2009.  He was fined �150  but  served  one  day  in  prison  for
      failure to pay.

26.          On  23  February  2010,  the   Appellant   was   convicted   of
      possessing/controlling an article for use in fraud.  He pleaded guilty
      in relation to the offence which occurred on 14 October 2009  and  was
      sentenced to a term of eight months in prison.

27.         On 20 August 2018, the Appellant pleaded  guilty  to  the  index
      offence which occurred on 3 March 2018.  He  pleaded  guilty  and  was
      sentenced to twelve months in prison.

28.         On 21 June 2019, the Appellant pleaded  guilty  to  two  further
      offences which occurred between January 2016  and  September  2017  of
      failing to notify a change of circumstances affecting  entitlement  to
      benefits.  He was made subject to a community order  and  unpaid  work
      requirement.

29.         In relation to the index offence, the Judge made  the  following
      remarks in sentencing:

            "...Yes, this is a very nasty offence  indeed.   The  jury  have
           convicted you of inflicting  grievous  bodily  harm,  a  serious
           offence in itself.
            I have  to  sentence  you  in  accordance  with  the  sentencing
           guidelines unless it's unjust to do  so.   The  guidelines  make
           clear that albeit you are not being sentenced on the basis  that
           you went in as a trespasser, nevertheless you did  assault  this
           man in his home.  And may I make it entirely plain to  you  that
           the fact that someone is a tenant in their house in this country
           doesn't mean that it's not their home.  This was his  home,  and
           you assaulted him in a thoroughly disgraceful way in  his  home.
           And accordingly, the case is a serious one.
            The prosecution suggest that you should be  in  a  greater  harm
           category because of the seriousness of the injuries.  These were
           very serious injuries, although fortunately your victim seems to
           have survived them well.  And  I've  seen  the  victim  personal
           statement, and there is no indication - thank heavens -  of  any
           serious long lasting consequences.  Nevertheless, it seems to me
           it would be quite wrong to sentence you on  the  basis  of  this
           being the  lowest  category,  category  3.   Your  counsel  very
           properly concedes that all the  aggravating  features  including
           your previous convictions such as  they  are  -  they're  not  a
           greatly aggravating feature,  but  you're  not  a  man  of  good
           character and you have  some  record  of  violence.   All  these
           matters mean that the case goes into the next category, albeit I
           keep it towards the lower end of that category.
            There's no question of any discount  for  a  guilty  plea.   You
           fought the case.  And  accordingly  it  seems  to  me  that  the
           appropriate sentence in your case is 12 months' imprisonment,  a
           year in prison.  You have, as I am told, been on remand for five
           months, and accordingly you'll be released within  a  relatively
           short period of time.  However, you will be on licence  for  the
           remainder of your sentence..."

30.          As  appears  from  the  foregoing,  there  appears  to   be   a
      contradiction between the Appellant's guilty plea and  his  conviction
      by a jury.  The Appellant explained in his oral evidence that this was
      because he was charged with  grievous  bodily  harm  and  robbery  and
      pleaded not guilty to the charge of robbery so stood  trial  for  both
      offences.   The  Appellant  also  suggested  that  he  had  not   been
      aggressive and used violence only by way of self-defence.   I  do  not
      accept that as he would not have been convicted if this were so.   The
      Judge's sentencing remarks also record the level of violence used  and
      that  the  Appellant's  criminal  record  contains   other   incidents
      involving the use of violence.

31.         In spite of the Appellant's  apparent  denial  of  part  of  the
      offence concerned, he did express remorse for his criminal  past.   He
      was released from prison in October 2018 and has  not  offended  since
      (his convictions in 2019 were  for  offences  committed  in  2016  and
      2017).   However, he has been imprisoned in  the  past  (in  2008  and
      2010) and did not apparently learn  his  lesson  on  those  occasions.
      Although Ms Cunha also made reference to the Appellant being served in
      2010 with a decision  warning  of  possible  deportation  action,  the
      Appellant denied receiving this and I can find no copy of this  letter
      in evidence.

32.         The Appellant also suggested  that  his  relationship  with  his
      wife and son might act as protective factors against further  criminal
      offending.  However, his relationship with his wife  has  broken  down
      and he no longer lives with her and his  son.   Although  there  is  a
      break in his offending between 2010 and about  2016,  which  coincides
      with the period when he was  living  with  his  wife  and  son,  those
      relationships did not prevent him offending thereafter.

33.         Similarly, the  Appellant  says  that  the  prospect  of  future
      employment places him at less  risk  of  further  offending.   He  was
      however in employment between 2008 and 2010.  That employment was,  as
      the Appellant clarified in his evidence, actually in the form of self-
      employment providing services to the  company  Kensington  Guards  Inc
      Ltd.  The Appellant explained that he was  not  a  security  guard  as
      such.  He was just sitting behind a desk watching a camera  in  a  car
      park and putting a ticket on the cars of  those  who  failed  to  pay.
      When it was pointed out to him that this apparently stable job had not
      prevented him committing offences, the Appellant said that this was  a
      "great mistake on [his] part".

34.         The Appellant  went  on  to  say  that  he  was  drunk  when  he
      committed the index offence.  Crucially, therefore, the Appellant says
      that the risk of further reoffending is much reduced or eradicated  by
      his abstinence from alcohol.  He says that he has been  abstinent  for
      two years.  He said in evidence that his drinking problem started when
      he  stopped  taking  drugs  (which  he  clarified  was  following  his
      conviction in 2008).  However,  when  it  was  pointed  out  that  his
      addiction to alcohol did not improve when his son was born in 2012, he
      said that "it was not so much of a drinking problem as you  think.   I
      could go without for a week and then let go and  binge  drink".   That
      gives me some cause for concern as it  appears  that,  even  now,  the
      Appellant is reluctant to admit to the addiction  which  lies  at  the
      heart of much of his criminal offending, including the  index  offence
      itself.

35.         The Appellant's friend, Ms Drankova, gave evidence which was  in
      the form of a character reference.  Her husband also provided a letter
      of support although did not give oral evidence.  The general tenor  of
      Ms Drankova's evidence was that the Appellant had made  mistakes  when
      he was very young and was explicable by him living in an  ex-communist
      country which did not have established rules.  When it was put to  her
      that the Appellant had committed his crimes  in  the  UK  and  not  in
      Lithuania, she accepted that but insisted that, because he  had  grown
      up in  an  ex-communist  country,  this  had  somehow  influenced  his
      behaviour here and that he had needed time to adjust.  She  suggested,
      as had the Appellant, that the index offence had occurred because  the
      Appellant was threatened, and she said that it was a mistake.

36.         Whilst I have no reason to doubt  Ms  Drankova's  evidence  that
      the Appellant was kind to her and her husband when they were  down  on
      their luck, I can give  her  evidence  no  weight  when  it  comes  to
      assessing the risk of the Appellant  reoffending  now.   Her  evidence
      ignores the fact that the Appellant has committed not one but a  large
      number of offences and over a period of about fourteen years since his
      arrival.  The Appellant was aged thirty years when he came to  the  UK
      and in his forties when he committed the index  offence.   It  is  not
      credible that his offending was caused or explained by  his  youth  or
      lack of adjustment on arrival in the UK.

37.         The more persuasive  evidence  concerning  the  risk  which  the
      Appellant poses is to be found in his actions during his  most  recent
      term of imprisonment and since leaving prison in October 2018.

38.         The Appellant has successfully completed a BTEC  HND  in  Health
      and Social Care (certificate dated 25  October  2019  at  [AB/C/246]).
      Although, as was pointed out to the Appellant in  the  course  of  his
      evidence, he may not be able to pursue his aim to find  employment  in
      this field (as such employment is likely to require a criminal records
      check), nonetheless it does show that the Appellant  is  committed  to
      finding meaningful employment and is willing to re-train to this  end.



39.         The Appellant has provided a letter from  Mr  Richard  Smith  of
      Kensington Guards Inc Ltd dated 9 November 2020 ([AB/B/99]).   I  have
      already explained that I was unable to  hear  oral  evidence  from  Mr
      Smith as he had another  work  commitment.   I  can  give  Mr  Smith's
      evidence some but more limited weight for the following  reasons.   Mr
      Smith says that the Appellant has worked for the company "since 2008".
       That is not entirely consistent with the Appellant's evidence that he
      was self-employed when he worked for that company and  his  employment
      was only for a couple of years.  I can also give limited weight to  Mr
      Smith's offer of "fulltime support" given the nature of  the  previous
      employment.  Mr Smith also describes the Appellant as  showing  during
      his employment that he has "leadership skills" which is not consistent
      with the Appellant's description of a quite menial job.   Nonetheless,
      I accept the letter  as  a  genuine  sign  of  intent  to  offer  some
      employment to the Appellant if he were allowed to remain  in  the  UK.
      Such employment may not be in the Appellant's  chosen  field  and  the
      offer of employment made by Mr Smith now has to be seen in the context
      of irregular work on  a  self-employed  basis.   However,  this  is  a
      positive indication.

40.         That said, I was unimpressed by the Appellant's evidence  as  to
      his (lack of) employment prospects, if he were to return to Lithuania.
       There is no evidence as to the general employment position there.  He
      has worked there in the past.  He has worked in a number of  different
      jobs and has training previously as a chef and a barber and now  as  a
      healthcare worker.

41.         Since leaving prison, the Appellant has also volunteered  for  a
      charity called Build on Belief.  The Service Manager and  Manager  for
      that organisation, Ms Helen Hayden and Ms Linda  Rose,  have  provided
      letters in support of the Appellant [AB/C/90 and 91].  Build on Belief
      describes itself as "a tier 2 level service for those  with  drug  and
      alcohol issues" which is run by volunteers.  The  Appellant  has  some
      training as a chef and has helped with cooking classes.   He  is  also
      involved with fitness programmes.  Ms Rose describes him as  "punctual
      and reliable" and a man who gets on well with others.

42.         There is a further letter dated 5 May 2020 from Ms  Linda  Chan,
      Lead Service Manager for this organisation ([AB/B/81]).  She describes
      how the Appellant "has always gone above and  beyond  his  role  as  a
      volunteer not only for other  volunteers  but  also  for  the  service
      users".  For example, he provides ad hoc translation for other Eastern
      Europeans who do not speak English.  She says that  the  Appellant  is
      "really focussed on his recovery and also willing to put in  the  hard
      work to maintain  his  recovery".   She  also  describes  him  as  "an
      invaluable member of our team".

43.         The documentary evidence also indicates that the Appellant  took
      advantage of his time in  prison  in  2018  to  undertake  courses  to
      improve his English  language  skills  and  to  engage  with  recovery
      programmes to address  his  substance  abuse  ([AB/C/92  and  94-96]).
      Further to that engagement, the Appellant self-referred  to  "Recovery
      Intervention  Service  Ealing"  ("RISE")  immediately  following   his
      release.  Letters from the Recovery Coordinator, Mr Andrew D'cruze and
      Group Recovery Worker, Mike Bishop at [AB/C/88-89]  confirm  that  the
      Appellant's "attendance and engagement have been excellent"  and  that
      "[t]his program has been very helpful in [the Appellant's]  recovery".
       Mr D'cruze reports, in August 2019, that  "it  was  clear  that  [the
      Appellant] remains focused in continuing to lead a positive  life  and
      he said that he has no intentions of ever returning  to  his  previous
      lifestyle".

44.         The evidence provided by the Probation  Service  was  criticised
      by Judge Davey when determining the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal.
       I set out the evidence at that stage at  [26]  of  the  Decision  and
      Judge Davey's findings in that regard at [27].  For the reasons I gave
      at [28] of the Decision, I agreed with Judge Davey that this  evidence
      was unsatisfactory and concurred with the giving of little  weight  to
      it.

45.         That evidence is now supplemented by additional  evidence  which
      appears  at  [AB/B/91-92].   The  e-mail  dated  20  October  2020  at
      [AB/B/92] is from Ms Sharon Dunbar who provided the initial  evidence.
      That reads as follows:

            "Mr Lodeiscikov  was  released  on  licence  on  11/10/2018  and
           initially he reported weekly for the first four weeks  and  then
           fortnightly moving on to monthly  reporting.   Each  session  is
           booked for one hour and depending  on  the  session  this  could
           sometime last for over an hour.
            Likelihood of further offending:   Using  OGRS  (Offender  Group
           Reconviction Scale) which draws upon statistical  date  such  as
           number and type of convictions and  age  at  first  and  current
           convictions, Mr Lodeiscikov is assessed as posing a low risk  of
           re-offending (12%) within 1 year and within 2 years (21%).  This
           is a system that is used to calculate risk of further  offending
           and risk of harm.
            Mr Lodeiscikov was on a 12  month  Community  Order  imposed  by
           Westminster   Magistrates   Court   on   21/06/2019   with   two
           requirements: any new order imposed  the  service  user  has  to
           attend an initial appointment and again once per  week  for  the
           first [four] weeks, thereafter  fortnightly  then  monthly.   In
           relation to any further offences or police contact, at that time
           BIU checks did not reveal any further  offences  or  any  police
           arrest after the COMMUNITY ORDER was imposed.   The  court  also
           did not inform us of any further offences committed."

46.         Whilst Ms Dunbar's evidence is still  lacking  to  some  degree,
      for example, in  relation  to  the  factors  which  have  led  to  the
      percentage risks calculated, I accept that the evidence  from  her  is
      certainly more detailed than was her initial evidence and I am able to
      place some weight on it.

47.         There is also a letter dated 16 October 2020, at [AB/B/91]  from
      Ms Natalie Pond, the Probation Service Office who assumed  conduct  of
      the Appellant's case in February 2020.  However, as she admits in this
      letter, she has had "very little contact" with the  Appellant  as  she
      has been away and off sick and therefore colleagues have  covered  her
      appointments  during  her  absence.   Although  she  notes  that   the
      Appellant missed two appointments, he provided medical evidence as  to
      the reasons for his failures to attend.  He has otherwise  been  fully
      compliant save on one occasion in May 2020 which was an appointment by
      phone when he missed the call and sought to phone back  the  same  day
      but outside working hours.   The Appellant is deemed by the  Probation
      Service to be a "lower risk Service User" and  therefore  appointments
      have been conducted by telephone since April 2020.  The Appellant  has
      completed 81 of the 150 hours unpaid work to which  he  was  sentenced
      but that is due to such work being on hold.  The  Appellant  has  only
      completed  2  of  the  35  days  of  rehabilitation  required  by  the
      Rehabilitation Activity Requirement but that is,  I  assume,  for  the
      same reason since no criticism is made by Ms Pond in that regard.   In
      conclusion Ms Pond says that "[o]verall Mr  Lodeiscikov  has  complied
      with his order to date".

48.         I can place little weight on Ms Pond's evidence as it  is  clear
      on her own account that she has had very  limited  dealings  with  the
      Appellant since she took over the case.  I accept however her evidence
      and that of Ms Dunbar that the Appellant has not offended or  been  in
      trouble with the police since his release from prison in October  2018
      (the more recent conviction pertaining as it does to events which pre-
      date his imprisonment).   I  also  note  and  take  into  account  the
      Probation Service's assessment of  the  Appellant  as  a  "lower  risk
      Service User".

Appellant's Ties to the UK and Life in Lithuania

49.         The unchallenged evidence is that the Appellant has a  wife  and
      son in the UK.  His mother and sister  (and  her  husband)  also  live
      here.

50.         Dealing first with the Appellant's relationship with  his  wife,
      Ms Laura Pashaeva,  she  and  the  Appellant's  son  have  been  given
      settlement status in the UK.  There is evidence that  Ms  Pashaeva  is
      seeking naturalisation and the intention is that their son  will  also
      apply for naturalisation.  There is  no  evidence,  however,  that  Ms
      Pashaeva's status is at risk of  being  affected  by  the  Appellant's
      criminal offending.  That does not therefore  provide  an  explanation
      for her failure to attend to give evidence in support of her  husband.
      As Mr Slatter very fairly accepted, this is part of a pattern  as  she
      did not attend either before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   I  have  no
      medical evidence in support of her assertion to the  Appellant  during
      the hearing that she was too unwell to attend.  Of course, it was only
      ever intended that she would attend remotely and  not  in  person  and
      there is nothing to suggest that she was suffering  from  any  illness
      which would have affected her ability to do that.

51.         Given Ms Pashaeva's reluctance to give  oral  evidence,  I  give
      her written  evidence  less  weight.   However,  in  any  event,  that
      evidence does not support  the  Appellant's  case  that  she  and  the
      Appellant are proposing to reconcile.  The Appellant  said  that  they
      had been waiting for him to complete his rehabilitation programme.  It
      may well be that he would wish to reconcile and thinks  that  this  is
      the obstacle to that occurring.

52.         However, Ms Pashaeva's evidence, including her letter signed  as
      recently as 2 November 2020 does not  reflect  any  desire  to  resume
      cohabitation with the Appellant.  Given the  emphasis  placed  by  the
      Appellant on his relationship with his wife and child in  relation  to
      proportionality, I set Ms Pashaeva's recent evidence out in full.  Her
      letter dated 2 November 2020 (at [AB/B/93]) reads as follows:

            "My name is Laura Pashaeva.  I am writing this letter to ask for
           your understanding and support in allowing my husband to stay in
           the United Kingdom.  I have been married to Jevgenij Lodeiscikov
           for over 9 years and we have amazing 8 years old son [E].   Like
           any family we have had ups and downs, but  Jevgenij  was  always
           supportive, caring, watchful and reliable father.
            Despite his illness and issues with alcohol,  we  have  remained
           together during very  difficult  times.   Due  to  all  stresses
           surrounding our relationships, me and Jevgenij split in  January
           2018.  When Jevgenij was sentenced in March  2018,  I  tried  to
           support him, however it was too distressing for me and our  son.
           After release from the prison,  Jevgenij  has  stopped  all  bad
           habits and has resumed his parental duties by continuing  to  be
           involved with his son.  [E] and  Jevgenij  have  great  bonding,
           which is incredibly important thing to nurture.  I truly believe
           that for [E] this bonding will result in healthier understanding
           of what it means to be a man, more of a chance  of  having  high
           self-esteem, more of a feeling of how to  succeed  in  life  and
           simply be happy.
            I would like to ask You to  allow  Jevgenij  to  remain  in  the
           country as his removal will  have  severe  emotional  impact  on
           Ernest and me."

53.         Although, read on its own,  the  final  sentence  might  suggest
      that Ms Pashaeva still wishes to continue her  own  relationship  with
      the Appellant, read in the context of  the  rest  of  the  letter,  my
      impression of her evidence is that the emotional impact to  which  she
      refers is on [E] and on her only as his mother.   Neither  I  nor  the
      Respondent was able to explore this evidence with Ms Pashaeva  as  she
      did not give oral  evidence.   I  therefore  give  her  evidence  less
      weight, particularly on this issue in relation to which  her  evidence
      is at best ambiguous.

54.         The Respondent, in her deportation decision, accepted  that  the
      Appellant has a subsisting relationship with his wife and son based on
      the evidence which was before her at that  time.   However,  that  was
      during the Appellant's imprisonment following his conviction which was
      itself  at  a  time  immediately  following  the  breakdown   of   the
      relationship.    Although  the  Appellant  and  Ms  Pashaeva  are  not
      divorced, I do not accept that there is any evidence that there is  an
      intention on her part to reconcile.

55.         However, the position in relation to the  Appellant's  son  also
      has to be taken into account.  [E] is aged eight  years.   He  as  the
      Appellant's wife has permanent residence in the UK.  Whilst  I  accept
      that there is limited evidence about the  Appellant's  role  in  [E]'s
      life, there is evidence of a continuing relationship.

56.          As  I  understand  the  Respondent's  position  based  on   the
      deportation decision, it is accepted that the  Appellant  has  (or  at
      that time had) a subsisting relationship with  his  son  but  did  not
      accept  that  the  Appellant  could  not  be  deported  due  to   that
      relationship.  Her position is that [E] and the Appellant's wife could
      stay in the UK without him or accompany him to Lithuania.

57.         The latter option may not  now  be  reasonable  given  that  the
      Appellant's relationship with his wife has broken down.  However,  the
      option of them remaining in the UK without him may still be  available
      if that is not disproportionate (whether under EU  law  or  Article  8
      ECHR).  In relation  to  Article  8  ECHR,  the  point  taken  by  the
      Respondent (in addition to the fact  that  [E]  is  not  a  qualifying
      child) is that the Appellant's relationship with [E] is not a parental
      one because there  is  not  "a  significant  and  meaningful  positive
      involvement" of the Appellant in [E]'s life.

58.         Ms Cunha's cross-examination of the Appellant  focussed  on  why
      he had not managed to continue direct  contact  with  [E]  during  the
      pandemic restrictions.  I am not persuaded that  the  lack  of  direct
      contact during that  period  is  indicative  of  the  quality  of  the
      relationship more generally.

59.         Whilst it is the case that separated parents with joint  custody
      of a child were both entitled to have staying contact with that  child
      during "lockdown", it is not clear to me that the Appellant's  contact
      with [E] had progressed to that stage.   The  Appellant  said  in  his
      evidence that his wife has sole care of [E].  In  any  event,  it  was
      explained by the Appellant's mother that  she  has  health  conditions
      (asthma) which meant that she was shielding and, since  the  Appellant
      lives with her, it would not  have  been  possible  for  [E]  and  the
      Appellant to have that direct contact.   The Appellant  gave  evidence
      which I accept that he  sees  [E]  when  he  is  able  to  do  so  and
      contributes to his upkeep, again when  he  is  able  to  do  so.   The
      Appellant's  wife  is  supportive   of   the   continuation   of   the
      relationship.

60.         That the Appellant continues to have  a  relationship  with  [E]
      though, does not necessarily mean that the relationship is a  parental
      one.  It is accepted that the Appellant is  [E]'s  biological  father.
      Whether the relationship is a  parental  one  though  depends  on  the
      degree of involvement he has in [E]'s upbringing and development.

61.         The evidence I have about the relationship, aside what  is  said
      by the  witnesses,  is  limited.   There  are  a   limited  number  of
      photographs of the Appellant with [E] which appear at  [AB/B/70-74]  -
      five photographs undated but which appear to have been taken on  three
      separate occasions - and at [AB/C/261-265] a further five  photographs
      also undated which also appear to have been taken on three or possibly
      four occasions.  There are also a few documents from [E]'s school  but
      those do not mention the Appellant and show that Ms Pashaeva is  their
      parental contact.  [E] does not have the Appellant's surname but  that
      may be for cultural reasons.

62.         I have already  set  out  Ms  Pashaeva's  most  recent  evidence
      including about the Appellant's relationship with [E].   Her letter to
      the Respondent dated 13 September 2018  at  [AB/C/58]  speaks  of  the
      Appellant "resuming [of] his parental responsibilities with his son as
      soon as he is released".  I do not place any  weight  on  that  in  my
      assessment of the legal position.  I anticipate that  she  meant  only
      that the Appellant would be able to resume contact and would  be  able
      to pay towards [E]'s upkeep.  Her statement dated 2 December  2019  at
      [AB/C/249-250] speaks of the Appellant and [E] having  a  close  bond,
      that the Appellant is "a positive influence on [their] son" (which  is
      perhaps debatable) and that [E] "looks up to and respects his father".
       She also says that the  Appellant  supports  her  "in  each  step  of
      [their] son's educational and upbringing developments".  She also says
      that he is "reliable and trustworthy" which is  perhaps  a  surprising
      statement in the context of her description of the  relationship  more
      generally.

63.         It is in any event evident from  Ms  Pashaeva's  statement  that
      her focus is on [E] and his wellbeing as she goes on to say  that  she
      "must protect" [E] "in the event his father is taken  out  of  [their]
      lives".

64.         The Appellant's own most recent statement (at [AB/B/75-79]  says
      the following about the relationship:

             "[10]       The  documents  which  appear  at  item  9-10   are
           particularly relevant to the fourth ground of the  appeal,  that
           being proportionality.  These documents demonstrate  my  genuine
           and subsisting relationship with my son [E].  I have attached  a
           few photographs taken from my face to face contact sessions with
           my son his birth which was taken on 12th March 2020,  since  the
           hearing on 12th December 2019.  I was  enjoying  regular  direct
           contact with my son by way of telephone calls and face  to  face
           meetings, until the lockdown,  which  was  imposed  due  to  the
           current  public  health  emergency.   Once  the  current  social
           distancing measures are eased, I will once again begin  to  have
           direct face to face contact with my son.  My return to Lithuania
           would result in a significant interference with my  relationship
           with my son."

65.         The Appellant's earlier statements and letters speak of  he  and
      his family being "a happy family unit" ([AB/C/49]) which was certainly
      not entirely true when that letter was written in September  2019  and
      that his son "means everything to [him]" ([AB/C/50]).  I accept  that,
      on Ms Pashaeva's evidence, prior to the Appellant's incarceration  for
      the index offence, the relationship remained intact  (at  least  until
      January 2018) and it is perhaps for that reason that little detail  is
      given of the relationship or  extent  of  it.    His  later  statement
      (dated 2 December 2019) confirms that he  continues  to  have  regular
      contact with his wife and  son  and  that  they  "spend  quality  time
      together".  It is  also  evident  from  that  statement  that  he  was
      involved in the decision  that  [E]  should  seek  naturalisation  and
      remain in the UK for his future.

66.         I have referred to the fact that the Appellant's sister,  Julija
      Olsanskaja, was not permitted to give evidence remotely despite  being
      online and ready to do so.  I did not receive any further evidence via
      the Appellant's solicitor in reply to Ms Cunha's only question of  her
      which concerned the extent to which she sees the Appellant in  company
      with his wife and son.  The Appellant himself said that she  has  seen
      him with them during either  summer  2020  or  possibly  the  previous
      summer.   Her only evidence in this regard is a very  brief  statement
      which says that the Appellant is a loving and caring father  and  that
      it is "very important for [E] to stay close  with  his  father".   She
      does not profess to have any qualifications to  make  that  assessment
      and there is no independent evidence in that regard.  That is no  more
      or less than the statement that one might expect of  a  family  member
      who is considering the prospect of separation of  a  father  from  his
      son.

67.         Although I accept that the evidence of the extent  of  the  role
      which the Appellant plays in [E]'s  upbringing  is  somewhat  limited,
      there is enough to show that there is a parental relationship (in  the
      context of an estranged relationship between [E]'s parents).   I  will
      come on to the impact of that relationship as regards  proportionality
      later in my decision.

68.         Ms Olsanskaja also says that  the  Appellant  provides  for  his
      grandmother in Lithuania financially and helps his mother.  It is said
      that if the Appellant returns to  Lithuania,  he  will  be  unable  to
      support his son financially  due  to  lack  of  employment  prospects.
      Again, there is no independent evidence as to employment prospects  in
      Lithuania and limited if any  evidence  about  the  financial  support
      which the Appellant provides to family  members  now.   The  Appellant
      obviously was unable to support his family when he was in  prison  and
      even now his work is on a voluntary basis.   The Appellant said in his
      evidence that his wife has a job as a children's  entertainer  and  is
      "earning quite good money".  He has only recently started to give  her
      money to help with his son's upkeep. I can therefore give only limited
      weight to Ms Olsanskaja's written evidence about  the  impact  of  the
      Appellant's deportation on his family.

69.          The  Appellant's  mother,  Tatjana  Molcanova,  says  that  the
      Appellant pays his grandmother's bills and for an  assistant  for  her
      but omits to mention what happened when the Appellant was  in  prison.
      She gave oral evidence that she works in the UK  and  also  worked  in
      Lithuania in the past and therefore  presumably  has  some  income  to
      assist with her own upkeep and that of her mother.

70.          In  relation  to  [E],  Ms  Molcanova's  main  concern  in  her
      statement appears to be that she would not see her grandchild  because
      she would return to Lithuania with the Appellant. When asked  why  she
      would have to leave the UK  in  the  event  that  the  Appellant  were
      deported, she said that she would "want to be with [her] son" that she
      wanted them to live together and that in Lithuania he would  be  alone
      so she would want to return to "help him settle".

71.         Although Ms Molcanova appeared unsure of her own status  in  the
      UK  when  giving  evidence,  I  accept  that  there  is  evidence  (at
      [AB/B/124]) that she has been given indefinite leave to remain in  the
      UK under the EU Settlement Scheme.  Were the Appellant  to  return  to
      Lithuania, she would therefore be giving up a right to remain  in  the
      UK.  That would, though, be a matter of her choice.

72.         It was also clear from Ms Molcanova's evidence that  she  spends
      at least some of the year in Lithuania now, with her mother. Both  the
      Appellant  and  his  mother  gave  evidence  that  her   mother   (the
      Appellant's  grandmother)  continues  to  live  in   Lithuania.    The
      Appellant's sister was in Lithuania at the time of the hearing  before
      me, looking after her grandmother.  The Appellant's mother  said  that
      she went back there to look after her mother as often  as  she  could.
      She goes back in summer to take her mother on holiday.   Although  she
      said that her mother only had a studio flat  in  Lithuania,  she  said
      that she (and the Appellant when he accompanies her) stay in the  flat
      with her mother.  The  Appellant's  mother  also  said  that  she  has
      friends in Lithuania.

73.         The Appellant also confirmed  that  he  visits  Lithuania  quite
      often to see his grandmother.  He also went to Lithuania for  a  month
      in 2014 to look after his grandfather when his grandfather was  dying.



74.         Ms Molcanova also says that  if  the  Appellant  were  deported,
      this would affect his ability to reconcile  with  his  wife.   I  have
      already referred to the evidence of the Appellant's  wife  which  does
      not show an intention to reconcile  irrespective  of  the  Appellant's
      immigration status.  I do not place weight on Ms Molcanova's views  in
      that regard.

75.         Dealing with  the  Appellant's  employment  in  the  UK  and  in
      Lithuania, I have already pointed out that the only evidence that  the
      Appellant  might  regain  paid  employment  is  from  Mr  Smith.   The
      Appellant has given evidence that this work previously was on a  self-
      employed basis and is  not  therefore  evidence  of  long-term  stable
      employment.  I have already pointed out that the  Appellant  may  face
      difficulties in securing stable employment in the  health  and  social
      care sphere due to his criminal record.

76.         The evidence of the Appellant's employment  in  the  UK  in  the
      past consists of documents at  [AB/C/97-113].   These  documents  show
      that the Appellant was self-employed from  2010  onwards.   He  earned
      �3207 in 2010-11, �6761 in 2011-12, �8524 in 2012-13, �9504 for  2013-
      14, �3046 for 2015-16  and  �9303  for  2016-17.   I  cannot  see  any
      evidence for 2014-15 and  thereafter  there  is  no  evidence  of  any
      earnings.  There is some evidence that  he  has  been  in  receipt  of
      benefits during this latter period.

77.         The Appellant gave evidence that he  has  worked  in  Lithuania.
      He has had a number of different careers including being a chef and  a
      barber for which he will no doubt have required some training.  He has
      undergone a recent course of  requalification  in  health  and  social
      care.  There is no evidence that he would not be able  to  retrain  if
      that were required in the future.

78.         The Appellant also  has  various  health  conditions  which  are
      managed by treatment in the UK.   The document at [AB/C/114]  dated  4
      April 2019 indicates that he has suffered from cirrhosis and hepatitis
      C in the past but he has been successfully treated for  hepatitis  and
      his liver function is said now to be "stable" (which is  an  indicator
      that he is truthful when  he  says  that  he  is  no  longer  drinking
      alcohol).  He is on medication for "essential hypertension"  and  gout
      and takes painkillers intermittently for osteoarthritis of  his  foot.
      He gave evidence that he  has  recently  undergone  an  operation  for
      varicose veins and was shortly due to have another  operation  on  the
      other leg.  There is no evidence that treatment  for  the  Appellant's
      conditions is not available in Lithuania.

79.         In  terms  of  the  Appellant's  past  alcohol  abuse,  that  is
      outlined in the hospital letter dated September  2017  at  [AB/C/130].
      At that time, he is said to have "stopped drinking heavily" but  still
      drunk (at that time) a bottle of wine at the weekend and two to  three
      pints during the week.  The content of that letter is consistent  with
      the Appellant's evidence that he was a "binge drinker".  The  evidence
      now is consistent with him remaining abstinent  as  he  said  was  the
      case.

FINDINGS, DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Imperative grounds or Serious grounds?

80.         The Appellant has lived in the UK for over ten years.   However,
      in order to establish that  the  Respondent  has  to  show  imperative
      grounds for his deportation, he would need to show that he has resided
      continuously for ten years dating back from the  decision  to  deport.
      Continuity  of  residence  is  broken  by  periods  of   imprisonment.
      However, the Tribunal has to consider whether integrative links formed
      in any earlier period are broken by the later imprisonment (see Vomero
      v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 49 at [13]).

81.         In this case, the Appellant came to the UK in 2004.   His  first
      conviction came in under two years from entry.  He was not  imprisoned
      until 2008  but  by  that  stage  had  already  amassed  a  number  of
      convictions for more minor offences.  He was imprisoned again in  2008
      following his first release and  was  sentenced  to  a  further  eight
      months in 2010.  Admittedly, he was not convicted of any  offences  in
      the period 2010 until the index offence some eight  years  later.   In
      fact, he was later convicted in 2019 for offences  committed  in  2016
      and 2017 so he was only free from offending for about six years in any
      event. His history of offending throughout the period between 2005 and
      2010  and  thereafter  between  2016  and  2018  does   not   indicate
      integration during that period.

82.         I concluded in my error of law decision at [15] that  there  was
      no error in Judge Davey's conclusion that "the  evidence  showed  that
      his periods of imprisonment and criminal conduct demonstrated that  he
      had broken any integrative links, if there ever were any, so that  the
      necessary 10 years  had  not  been  established  to  require  enhanced
      grounds to remove him".

83.         Although I was invited to revisit that conclusion based  on  the
      additional evidence which was before me, I  am  unpersuaded  that  any
      different conclusion can be reached.   The  evidence  shows  that  the
      Appellant has links with family members and a few friends  in  the  UK
      (for the most part also of Eastern European origin).  There is however
      scant evidence as  to  the  Appellant's  integration  in  the  UK  via
      employment and relationships formed here.  The evidence does not  show
      that, in 2018 when he was imprisoned for the  index  offence,  he  had
      integrated in the UK.  At best, the evidence shows  that  he  had  not
      offended for a  period of about six years but that is  not  in  itself
      sufficient to show integrative links which had  been  forged  in  that
      period.  I therefore conclude that  the  Appellant  cannot  show  that
      imperative grounds are required to justify his deportation.

84.         The Respondent  does  however  concede  that  the  Appellant  is
      permanently resident in the UK by reason of the evidence of his length
      of residence coupled with the evidence as to  his  employment  (albeit
      not particularly well paid) for a period  of  five  years.   That  was
      conceded when Ms Pashaeva was accorded settlement.

85.         Accordingly, the Respondent must show  that  there  are  serious
      grounds for  believing  that  the  Appellant  constitutes  a  genuine,
      present and sufficiently serious threat to public policy and  security
      in the UK.

Assessment of Risk

86.         Mr Slatter submits, and I accept, that the type of past  conduct
      of which the Appellant has been convicted is not itself sufficient  to
      satisfy the test as to risk. Past conduct may be indicative of present
      risk but that present risk must be assessed based on the evidence.  In
      an extreme case, the past conduct may be sufficient in and  of  itself
      to satisfy the test (see R v Bouchereau [1978] 1 QB 732).  However, as
      the Court of Appeal said in Secretary of State for the Home Department
      v Robinson [2018] EWCA Civ 85 at [85], that reasoning is reserved  for
      a case where the "facts are very extreme" and where the  past  conduct
      has caused "deep public revulsion" ([84-86]).  Although the  Appellant
      has amassed a large number of convictions  and  the  offences  are  of
      escalating seriousness, this case does not fall within that  category;
      nor did I understand the Respondent to assert that it does.

87.         The index  offence  was  one  involving  violence.   Although  I
      accept that sentencing was "towards the lower end of [the]  category",
      the sentencing Judge made clear that he did not view the Appellant  as
      being of good character and that some of  his  previous  offences  had
      also involved violence.  It goes without saying based on  the  history
      of offending which I set out at [20] to [29] above that the  Appellant
      has shown a strong propensity to reoffend in the past.

88.         Turning then to the evidence about the risk which the  Appellant
      poses currently, as I indicated at [46] above, the evidence  from  the
      Probation Service about the risk, whilst better than that before Judge
      Davey, is still not particularly detailed.  I can, however, place some
      weight on it.  That evidence indicates that the  Appellant  is  a  low
      risk.  That is not to say that he poses a negligible risk.   The  risk
      is said to be 12% in the first year  rising  to  21%  in  the  second.
      However, he remains assessed as a "lower risk Service  User".   I  can
      also take into account now the actuality of the  situation  since  the
      Appellant has been out of custody now for over two years.

89.         The Appellant's offending behaviour in the  past  is  linked  to
      his addictions, first to drugs and then  to  alcohol.   The  Appellant
      gave  evidence  that  he  had  ceased  to  use  drugs  following   his
      imprisonment in 2008.  He also gave evidence  that  he  has  abstained
      from alcohol since the commission of the index offence.   I  indicated
      at [34] above, that I have some concerns whether  the  Appellant  even
      now recognises the extent of his alcohol dependency.  If he does  not,
      he might be more tempted to revert to that  behaviour  which  in  turn
      would or might lead to an enhanced risk of  reoffending.   However,  I
      can place weight on the fact that he has not returned to  drink  since
      his release from prison in October 2018.

90.         I can also place weight on the Appellant's  actions  during  his
      last term of imprisonment and since his release.   He  has  undertaken
      courses in prison.  Since his release he  has  been  volunteering  for
      Build on Belief.  That organisation is there to help him to tackle his
      own addiction, but the Appellant  has  also  provided  services  on  a
      voluntary basis to others to assist them with  their  own  addictions.
      The testimony from those involved with that organisation speaks highly
      of him.  I am satisfied that those persons and the  organisation  more
      generally would  not  permit  the  Appellant's  involvement  with  the
      organisation in this way if there were any concerns about the risk  of
      further offending.

91.          I  also  place  weight  on  the  reports  from   the   Recovery
      Coordinator  and  Group   Recovery  Worker  from  RISE  which  I  have
      mentioned at [43] above as  to  the  Appellant's  progress  since  his
      release and engagement with their support services.

92.          I  am  unpersuaded  on  the  evidence  that   the   Appellant's
      relationships with his wife,  son  and  other  family  members  are  a
      sufficient  protective  factor  against  further  offending.   He  was
      married and his son was born when  he  committed  the  index  offence.
      Whilst I accept that this offence was, on the evidence, preceded by  a
      fairly lengthy period of non-offending  (at  least  between  2010  and
      2016), he reoffended after the birth of his son and when his  familial
      circumstances were much as they are now (except now, as I have  found,
      his relationship with his wife has deteriorated).

93.         I am also unpersuaded that  the  offer  of  paid  employment  is
      sufficient in and of itself to prevent the Appellant reoffending.   As
      I have indicated, that job offer has to be looked at in context.   The
      Appellant's previous employment for the same company was  as  a  self-
      employed person.   The job appears  to  have  been  quite  menial  and
      employment appears to have been of a sporadic and short-term nature.

94.         Whilst, as I have pointed out at [38] above, the  Appellant  may
      not be able to secure work in the  field  in  which  he  has  recently
      obtained  his  qualification,  the  obtaining  of  that  qualification
      provides strong evidence of the Appellant's motivation to  change  his
      life.

95.         Balancing the above considerations and giving such weight  as  I
      consider appropriate to the pieces of evidence individually and  as  a
      whole, I have reached  the  conclusion  that  there  are  not  serious
      grounds for believing that the Appellant is  a  genuine,  present  and
      sufficiently serious risk to public policy and public security in  the
      UK.

96.         It follows from that conclusion that the Respondent  has  failed
      to justify the Appellant's deportation and he is entitled to  succeed.
      Strictly, I do not need to go on to consider the relative prospects of
      rehabilitation in the UK  and  Lithuania  or  proportionality  whether
      under the EEA Regulations or Article 8 ECHR.  I do so however in  case
      it should be necessary to revisit those issues if the  case  is  taken
      further or in the event that the Appellant reoffends.

Proportionality of Deportation

97.         As I have found on the evidence, I  am  not  satisfied  that  Ms
      Pashaeva has any interest in reconciling  her  relationship  with  the
      Appellant.  Whilst she is not obstructing the Appellant's contact  and
      continued relationship with his son, I have already indicated  that  I
      do not consider that either relationship with his wife  or  son  is  a
      sufficient protective factor  to  prevent  the  Appellant  reoffending
      (were I to have concluded that he  remained  at  risk  of  doing  so).
      Through no fault of his own, the Appellant  has  had  limited  contact
      with his son throughout the past months during the pandemic.   He  has
      retained contact by remote means.

98.          The  Respondent   has   considered   whether   deportation   is
      proportionate  applying  Article  8  ECHR  and  I  am  not   therefore
      restricted  in  my  consideration  of  proportionality  to   the   EEA
      Regulations.  Whilst I accept that the Appellant may be said to remain
      in a parental relationship with [E], there  is  scant  information  or
      evidence about the impact of deportation on [E].  Ms Pashaeva and  the
      Appellant say that the absence of his father  would  have  an  adverse
      emotional impact on [E] and I accept that this  will  be  so  to  some
      degree.  I accept that, marginally, it may be in [E]'s best  interests
      to  remain  in  the  UK  with  both  parents  (even  though  they  are
      estranged).  However, applying Section 117C  Nationality,  Immigration
      and Asylum Act 2002, I would not have  concluded  that  it  is  unduly
      harsh to deport the Appellant in the circumstances.  There  is  simply
      not enough evidence that the  impact  would  be  particularly  severe.
      There is no evidence that [E] was unduly affected by  the  Appellant's
      term in prison.

99.         The Appellant's sister and her family reside in the UK  although
      continue  to  visit  Lithuania.    More   importantly,   though,   the
      Appellant's mother with whom he currently resides (and  has  done  for
      some time) continues to have ties with Lithuania.   Her  mother  lives
      there and she visits regularly to look after her mother and  take  her
      on holiday.  She has friends in that country.  Importantly, also,  she
      said that, if the Appellant were deported, she would go  with  him  to
      Lithuania to help him settle there.

100.        I have already  found  in  the  context  of  whether  imperative
      grounds needed to be shown for  deportation  that  the  Appellant  has
      failed to show that he has any or any strong integrative links in  the
      UK.  Such links as he has demonstrated on the evidence  now  are  ones
      which have been forged since he left  prison  in  2018.   They  remain
      quite weak.

101.        The Appellant continues to have links  to  Lithuania.   He  said
      that he visits quite often  mainly  to  look  after  his  grandmother.
      There is no evidence that he has lost his ties to  that  country.   He
      left there when he was already aged thirty years.  He has worked there
      in the past.  There is no evidence that he would not be able  to  find
      paid employment there on return,  particularly  given  his  previously
      acquired  skills   in   various   professions   and   newly   acquired
      qualifications.  In fact, as I have observed, he may struggle to  find
      work in his chosen field in the UK due  to  criminal  records  checks.
      That may be less of a problem in Lithuania (although I accept  that  I
      have no evidence whether that is so).

102.        I do not have any evidence either that  the  Appellant's  health
      conditions cannot be managed in Lithuania via medication in  the  same
      way as they are in the UK.

103.         If  I  had  found  that  the  Appellant's  rehabilitation   was
      incomplete and that he remained a sufficient risk, I  would  not  have
      found that his prospects of rehabilitation in Lithuania were less than
      in the UK.   He would continue to have family support there and  there
      is no evidence  that  he  would  be  any  less  likely  to  find  paid
      employment in Lithuania than in the  UK.   He  has  had  very  limited
      ongoing engagement with the Probation  Services,  particularly  during
      the pandemic.  I have found that he has limited integrative  links  in
      the UK and that he continues to have links to Lithuania.  This case is
      dissimilar on its facts to those under consideration in  Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department v Dumliauskas and others [2015] EWCA Civ
      145.

104.        For all those  reasons,  had  I  concluded  that  the  Appellant
      remains a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat  to  public
      policy and public security in the UK, I would not have concluded  that
      deportation would be disproportionate on the facts of  this  case  and
      the evidence before me.  As it is, though, I allow the appeal  on  the
      basis that the Respondent has failed to make out her case  as  to  the
      risk which the Appellant poses.

Conclusion

105.        The Respondent  has  failed  to  show  that  there  are  serious
      grounds to believe that the Appellant poses  a  genuine,  present  and
      sufficiently serious threat to public policy and  public  security  in
      the UK.  Accordingly, deportation  is  not  justified  under  the  EEA
      Regulations and the appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.

DECISION
The Appellant's appeal is allowed under the EEA Regulations.

                           DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

BACKGROUND

1.          The Appellant appeals against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal Judge Davey promulgated on 3 January 2020  ("the  Decision").
      By the Decision, the Judge dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal  against
      the Respondent's decision dated 1 October 2018  making  a  deportation
      order against him  under  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
      Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations").

2.          The Appellant is a national  of  Lithuania.   The  date  of  his
      entry into the UK and residence here  is  the  subject  of  a  dispute
      between the parties.  The Respondent did not accept that the Appellant
      had been continuously resident in the UK for ten years  prior  to  his
      imprisonment.  The Appellant claims to have come to the UK  in  August
      2004.

3.           The  Appellant   was   convicted   on   20   August   2018   of
      wounding/inflicting grievous bodily harm and was sentenced to a period
      of twelve months in prison.

4.          The Judge accepted that the Appellant had, as a matter of  fact,
      been in the UK for over ten years as at the date of  the  Respondent's
      decision to deport.  By reference to relevant case-law, he  considered
      whether the period of imprisonment had broken integrative links forged
      prior to that period.  However,  based  on  the  Appellant's  previous
      criminal  offending,  he  did  not  accept  that  the  Appellant   was
      integrated ([32] of the Decision).  The Judge gave  little  weight  to
      the views of the Appellant's  probation  officer  that  the  Appellant
      poses a low risk.  He noted the attempts  made  by  the  Appellant  to
      abstain from alcohol whilst in prison.   His  alcoholism  is  directly
      linked to the risk of reoffending.   Based  on  the  totality  of  the
      evidence, the Judge concluded that the Appellant posed a  genuine  and
      present  risk of reoffending which was "sufficiently serious" ([44] of
      the Decision).

5.          The Appellant was in a relationship with a Russian national,  Ms
      Pashaeva, and they have a son, [E] born in 2012.   The  Appellant  and
      his wife are now  separated.   The  Judge  accepted  that  [E]'s  best
      interests lie in having continued contact with  his  father  and  that
      there would be "significant interference" with  that  relationship  if
      the Appellant were deported, which interference could not be  overcome
      by remote forms of communication.   Nonetheless, the  Judge  concluded
      that the Respondent's decision to deport was proportionate.

6.          The Appellant raises four grounds of appeal as follows:
            Ground one: the Judge failed  to  take  into  account  that  the
      Appellant had acquired permanent residence (which was not disputed  by
      the Respondent) and therefore failed to take into account that serious
      grounds of public policy were required to justify expulsion.
            Ground two: the Judge's analysis of the risk of reoffending  was
      unsupported by the evidence and  "Wednesbury  unreasonable".   In  the
      alternative, the Judge failed to give adequate weight to the views  of
      the Appellant's probation officer and erred in fact  when  considering
      the extent of the probation officer's involvement with the Appellant.
            Ground three: the Judge failed  to  provide  sufficient  reasons
      for his conclusion as to the  Appellant's  likely  future  conduct  in
      light of the efforts made to rehabilitate whilst in prison.
            Ground  four:  the  Judge  failed  to  take  into  account  when
      considering proportionality the  likely  prospects  of  rehabilitation
      and/or failed to provide sufficient reasons to justify his conclusions
      in that regard.

7.          Permission to appeal was granted by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
      Landes on 28 January 2020 in the following terms so far as relevant:

            "..2.      I consider it  arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to
           apply the correct 'serious grounds' test.   He  does  not  refer
           anywhere to the respondent's acceptance that the  appellant  had
           achieved permanent residence and he described the test he had to
           apply at [44] as 'the  appellant's  conduct  represented  now  a
           genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat'   without
           mentioning anything additional.
            3.   I also consider  that  the  judge  erred  in  failing  when
           considering  proportionality  to  consider   and   compare   the
           appellant's prospects for rehabilitation in the UK  as  compared
           with Lithuania.
            4.    I  do  not  consider  it  arguable  that  the  judge  gave
           inadequate reasons for considering that the appellant's  conduct
           since the offence could not  yet  be  seen  as  sustained  or  a
           reliable indicator of  future  conduct.   The  appellant  was  a
           serial criminal who had had alcohol problems and in that context
           the judge was entitled to conclude  that  although  he  had  not
           significantly offended since 2018 that was too  short  a  period
           for his present good conduct to be seen as sustained.  I also do
           not consider it arguable that the judge gave inadequate  reasons
           relating to the  probation  officer;  whilst  it  is  not  clear
           whether  the  judge  appreciated  that  the  officer  had   been
           supervising  the  appellant  before  the  community  order   was
           imposed, the officer still did not explain who she  had  reached
           her assessment of risk.
            5.   Despite my comments,  I  do  not  intend  to  restrict  the
           grounds which may be argued."

8.          By a Note and Directions dated 26 March  2020  and  sent  on  24
      April 2020, having reviewed the file, I reached the  provisional  view
      that it would be appropriate to determine without a hearing  (pursuant
      to Rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  -
      "the Procedure Rules") the following questions:
            (a)  whether the making of the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
           involved the making of an error of law and, if so
                 (b)   whether that decision should be set aside.
            Directions were given for the parties  to  make  submissions  in
      writing on the appropriateness of that course and further  submissions
      in relation to the  error  of  law.  The  reasons  for  the  Note  and
      Directions was the "present  need  to  take  precautions  against  the
      spread of Covid-19, and the  overriding  objective  expressed  in  the
      Procedure Rules".

9.          On 6 May 2020, the Appellant  filed  written  submissions.   The
      Appellant repeated in summary form the grounds to which I refer above.
       In relation to whether the error of law  issue  could  be  determined
      without an oral hearing, the Appellant submitted that it was not clear
      why I had reached the view that  the  error  of  law  issue  could  be
      determined on the papers and that, as the Respondent had  failed  thus
      far to  indicate  her  response  to  the  appeal,  it  was  "extremely
      difficult to meaningfully add to the grounds  of  appeal   upon  which
      permission to appeal was granted".   As  such,  an  oral  hearing  was
      requested.

10.         It remains the position that  the  Respondent  has  not  replied
      either to the Appellant's challenge to the Decision or to the Note and
      Directions.  However, I  do  not  understand  why  the  absence  of  a
      response nor the fact that the Appellant  is  unable  to  add  to  the
      grounds as pleaded indicates that an oral  hearing  is  required.   If
      anything, the converse is true since it indicates that  the  pleadings
      set out the Appellant's full case in relation to the grounds, that the
      Respondent has no comments to make and that  little  would  be  gained
      from an oral hearing.

11.         In those circumstances, I do not consider that either  a  remote
      hearing or a face to face hearing is  necessary  in  order  fairly  to
      consider the Appellant's case at this stage.  A face to  face  hearing
      is not currently practicable and the error of law issue can fairly  be
      determined on the  basis  of  the  pleaded  grounds  put  forward.   I
      therefore proceed to determine the error of law issue on  the  papers.
      At this stage, the issue for me is whether the  Decision  contains  an
      error of law.  If I so conclude, I will need  to  either  re-make  the
      decision or remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal to do so.

12.         The Appellant has also made  an  application  pursuant  to  rule
      15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 to adduce
      further evidence which was not before the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge.
      It is said that items one and two with that  application  were  before
      the Judge but not until after the hearing and he refused to take  them
      into account.  I have not been able to find those  on  file.   In  any
      event, they confirm the Appellant's enrolment into full-time education
      which the Judge accepted as fact ([41] of the  Decision).   The  other
      documents were not before the Judge  and  therefore  cannot  serve  to
      impugn the Decision but may be relevant  to  the  materiality  of  any
      error.  They may also be relevant as additional evidence in the  event
      that I find an error of law to exist.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

13.         As the Appellant points out in his  submissions  and  I  accept,
      the grant of permission to appeal is focussed on the first and  fourth
      grounds and therefore I begin with those.

Ground One

14.         Regulation 27(3) of  the  EEA  Regulations  provides  that  "[a]
      relevant decision may not be taken in respect of a person with a right
      of permanent residence under regulation 15 except on  serious  grounds
      of public policy and public security".  The  Respondent  disputed  the
      Appellant's claimed  residence  in  the  UK.   However,  although  she
      initially  disputed  that  the  Appellant   had   acquired   permanent
      residence, by her letter dated 10 October 2018, she conceded  that  he
      had done so.    However,  she  otherwise  maintained  the  deportation
      decision.   It follows that  the  Judge's  statement  at  [4]  of  the
      Decision that "the Secretary of State did not accept the Appellant had
      acquired permanent residence  in  the  United  Kingdom"  is  factually
      incorrect.  Although reference is  made  thereafter  (at  [6]  of  the
      Decision) to the 10 October letter, there is no  recognition  in  that
      paragraph that the Respondent had conceded this issue.

15.         This error is not overcome by the Judge's own  consideration  of
      the issue.  The focus of the Judge's consideration of  the  period  of
      the Appellant's residence relates to whether the Appellant could  rely
      on his ten  years'  residence  (see  [8]  and  [12]  to  [32]  of  the
      Decision).  Although the Judge accepts at [14] of  the  Decision  that
      "the Appellant had shown on a balance of  probabilities  that  he  did
      engage the Regulations in relation to the time  spent  in  the  United
      Kingdom from 2004" that is thereafter taken into account only in terms
      of whether the period of residence showed the forging  of  integrative
      links  not  broken  by  the  period  of  imprisonment.   The   Judge's
      conclusion in this regard ([32]) is that "the evidence showed that his
      periods of imprisonment and criminal conduct demonstrated that he  had
      broken any integrative links, if there ever  were  any,  so  that  the
      necessary 10 years  had  not  been  established  to  require  enhanced
      grounds to remove him".   There is no challenge to that finding and no
      error in the Judge's reasoning in that regard.

16.         There is however no separate consideration of the effect of  the
      finding that the Appellant had been in the UK  for  over  five  years.
      There is no reference to regulation 27(3) and to the need for  serious
      grounds being required to  justify  the  Appellant's  expulsion.   The
      closest one comes is the Judge's conclusion at [44] that the Appellant
      "remained a genuine and present risk, in the sense  of  real  risk  of
      reoffending,  which  continued  as  a  sufficiently   serious   risk".
      However, that statement goes to the seriousness of the risk and not to
      the sufficiency of the justification required to deport him.

17.         The Appellant draws my  attention  to  the  case  of  Hussein  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 156.   That
      is a not dissimilar case where the Court of Appeal concluded  that  it
      could not be satisfied that the Judge had adopted the right test.  For
      similar reasons in this case, I conclude that the Appellant has  shown
      by his first ground that the Judge has erred  in  law  by  failing  to
      apply the "serious grounds" test.  I will return to materiality in due
      course.

Ground Four

18.         Regulation 27(5)(a) of the EEA  Regulations  provides  that  the
      decision to deport must comply with the principle of  proportionality.
      The Appellant says that the  Judge  has  failed  to  provide  adequate
      reasons to justify his conclusions.  He also says that the  Judge  has
      failed to consider the Appellant's prospects of  rehabilitation  under
      that heading.  As the Appellant accepts, the basis  of  the  grant  of
      permission on this point is slightly more nuanced.  Judge Landes found
      it arguable that the Judge had failed to  "consider  and  compare  the
      appellant's prospects for rehabilitation in the UK  as  compared  with
      Lithuania".

19.         The Judge recounts at [31] to [44] the evidence and  submissions
      concerning the  Appellant's  progress  towards  rehabilitation.   That
      passage recognises the relevant factors  as  the  Appellant's  grounds
      appear to accept.  It is though suggested that the Judge has failed to
      provide reasons for his conclusions in this regard.

20.          The  Judge  accepted  at  [44]  of  the  Decision  that   "[the
      Appellant] has some insight into the impact of his offending, and more
      self control, insofar as there ever can be, of his problems associated
      with alcoholism".  However, "[i]n the  context  of  [the  Appellant's]
      serial  criminality"  the  Judge  "had  reservations  about  the  real
      intentions of the Appellant".  The Judge expressed  "some  hope"  that
      the Appellant would not revert to alcohol.   Read  as  a  whole,  this
      section contains reasons which are adequate.  In that regard,  I  find
      the point made at [9] of the Appellant's further submissions difficult
      to follow.  The Appellant's child was already aged six  years  at  the
      date of the index offence.  The Appellant married his  wife  in  2011.
      Therefore, if family ties were likely  to  influence  the  Appellant's
      prospects of rehabilitation, it is unclear why they did not deter  him
      from offending previously.

21.         There are however two reasons why I find there to  be  an  error
      of law in this regard. The first is that identified by  Judge  Landes;
      that is to say  the  Judge's  failure  to  consider  the  prospect  of
      rehabilitation in Lithuania when compared with  the  UK,  particularly
      since it was accepted by the Judge that his wife and son would  remain
      here and that  deportation  would  significantly  interfere  with  and
      interrupt the relationship between the Appellant and his son.

22.         The second is the  reliance  placed  by  the  Appellant  in  his
      further submissions on the Court of Appeal's judgment in Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department v Dumliauskas and others [2015] EWCA Civ
      145 where, at [45] and [46], the Court said this:

           "45.  The judgment of the Court of Justice in Tsakouridis was
           considered by the Upper Tribunal, consisting of the President
           Blake J and UTJ Warr, in Daha Essa v Secretary of State for the
           Home Department [2013] UKUT 316 (IAC). The Tribunal concluded
           that the prospects of rehabilitation in the offender's home
           State are relevant to the decision to deport only if he has
           acquired a permanent right of residence:
                 23. As we observed in our ruling and directions the Court
                 of Justice in Tsakouridis used the term 'genuinely
                 integrated' to describe those for whom the prospects of
                 rehabilitation were a relevant issue in the assessment of
                 the balance.
                 24. Tsakouridis was a case where the Court examined the
                 issue of imperative grounds relating to those who had
                 resided in the host state for ten years or more. The Court
                 of Appeal in the instant case did not elaborate on whether
                 the principles apply generally or only to those who had
                 permanent rights of residence. As the case below was
                 determined on the basis of an assumption that the appellant
                 had rights of permanent residence, we conclude that the
                 Court of Appeal did not consider that only those with ten
                 years residence could benefit from the principle.
                 25. In our directions for remaking, we invited the parties
                 to consider the matter and suggested that the test was
                 genuine integration rather than the precise number of years
                 of residence. Mr Allan's skeleton argument disputed that
                 proposition and suggested that genuine integration was not
                 a novel test but only shorthand for the structured approach
                 based on length of residence.
                 26. We agree that the Court's reference to genuine
                 integration must be directed at qualified persons and their
                 family members who have resided in the host state as such
                 for five years or more. People who have just arrived in the
                 host state, have not yet become qualified persons, or have
                 not been a qualified person for five years, can always be
                 removed for non-exercise of free movement rights
                 irrespective of public good grounds to curtail free
                 movement rights. If their presence during this time makes
                 them a present threat to public policy it would be
                 inconsistent with the purposes of the Directive to weigh in
                 the balance against deportation their future prospects of
                 rehabilitation.
          46. While I have considerable sympathy with this approach, I am
              unable to agree with it. I can think of no other example of a
              factor bearing on proportionality being relevant to those who
              qualify in a certain respect (here, lawful residence) but not
              others. Once proportionality is engaged, the factors to be
              taken into account do not vary with the qualifications of the
              individual concerned. In addition, what was said by the Upper
              Tribunal in that appeal is not consistent with its error of
              law decision in ME, referred to at paragraph 23 above. As I
              point out below, the cases of AD and ME highlight this
              conclusion. What is however affected by length of legal
              residence (in the sense used in Art 16.1) is the weight to be
              given to the respective prospects of rehabilitation. In
              addition, it seems to me that the decision of the Upper
              Tribunal in Daha Essa is inconsistent with what was said by
              Maurice Kay LJ in Daha Essa."
              [my emphasis]

23.         Taken together with  the  error  identified  under  ground  one,
      therefore, there is an error arising from the failure of the Judge  to
      recognise  that  the  Appellant  had  established  an  entitlement  to
      permanent residence.

Grounds Two and Three

24.         Although, as the Appellant  accepts,  the  grounds  which  found
      favour with Judge Landes were one and four, and which grounds  I  have
      found to be made out, it may be helpful if I make  brief  observations
      about these other two grounds.

25.          There  is  a  substantial  crossover  between  the  Appellant's
      grounds three and  four  and  therefore,  having  found  an  error  in
      relation to ground four, I  do  not  consider  it  necessary  to  deal
      separately with ground three.

26.         The focus of ground two is  the  Judge's  conclusion  about  the
      probation  officer's  "report"  which  appears  from  a  short   typed
      "Progress Report" and an exchange of e  mails  between  the  probation
      officer and the Appellant's solicitors at [AB/81-83]. The substance of
      the latter is is to be found in the following:

            "Further to our telephone conversation I can confirm that  since
           the above has been released from HMP Chelmsford on 11/10/2018 he
           has reported steadily and the main focus of supervision has been
           around
                 Exploring offending behaviour (anger management)
                 Explore alcohol issues
                 Exploring victim empathy
                 Problem-solving exercise
            There are no current issues or concerns and  Mr  Lodeiscikov  is
           compliant with his Post Sentence Supervision Order."


       The "Progress Report" (dated 11 December 2019 and  filed  separately)
           reads as
        follows:


            "Mr Lodeiscikov is currently  on  a  12  month  Community  Order
           imposed by Westminster Magistrates Court on 21/06/2019 with  two
           requirements:
            Rehabilitation Activity Requirement (RAR) 35 days
            Unpaid work - 150 hours
            In relation to Mr Lodeiscikov Community Order  he  has  reported
           consistently and is engaging well with his RAR  supervision  and
           Community Payback.  He also  attends  Ealing  Drug  and  Alcohol
           Services and is currently undertaking voluntary work  with  them
           three times per week.  They are very  happy  with  his  positive
           attitude and his willingness to work.
            The focus of work for Supervision has been around:
               - Exploring  offending  behaviour  which  is  linked  alcohol
                 misuse
               - Exploring thinking and problem solving skills and to  raise
                 victim awareness.
           Mr Lodeiscikov is assessed as posing a low risk of  re-offending
           and at this point I am not aware  of  any  further  offences  or
           contact with the police."


27.         The Judge dealt with this evidence  at  [39]  and  [40]  of  the
      Decision as follows:

            "39. The decision I reached was solely based  upon  the  conduct
           of the Appellant.  I take  into  account  that  the  Appellant's
           probation  officer,  Ms  S  Dunbar,  expressed  in  a   somewhat
           inadequate letter, despite requests for a report, the view  that
           the Appellant did not present anything other than a low risk  of
           reoffending.  It was clear Ms Dunbar was a probation officer but
           the material she produced did not show  her  experience  or  the
           basis for the view she formed of a low risk of reoffending.  Her
           view may be right but it was of limited value as the  expression
           of an opinion without any evident reasoning behind it.  I attach
           little weight to her opinion.  Her note recorded  the  Appellant
           has been  undertaking  rehabilitation  activities,  involved  in
           unpaid work, has reported in accordance with  requirements  upon
           him  and  engaged  well   with   his   rehabilitation   activity
           requirement,  supervision  and  community  payback.    It   also
           confirmed  that  the  Appellant  attended  a  drug  and  alcohol
           services system and was undertaking voluntary work three times a
           week, displaying a positive attitude and willingness to work.
            40.  It was said by Ms Rupra that she has for  about  one  month
           tried  to  get  a  full  report  from  Ms  Dunbar,  whose  email
           attachment  of  11  December  2019  was  materially  brief   but
           obviously related to  contact  she  has  been  having  with  the
           Appellant pursuant to a twelve month community order imposed  by
           Westminster Magistrates in June 2019."

28.         Even if it is the case that the  Judge  has  misunderstood  from
      that last sentence the extent of the probation  officer's  interaction
      with the Appellant in terms of the  start  of  his  reporting  to  her
      (which is not entirely clear in any event), the fact remains that  the
      evidence is unsatisfactory.  Ms Dunbar does not in fact say in  her  e
      mail or letter when contact commenced and, in any event does  not  say
      how often she has contact or for how long on each  occasion.   As  the
      Judge points out, Ms Dunbar's assessment of risk is unreasoned and  is
      to an extent equivocal (she says  that  she  is  "not  aware"  of  any
      further contact with the police or offences).  The Judge was  entitled
      to give that evidence little weight.  I make that observation in order
      to draw the Appellant's attention to the evidential deficiency in this
      regard.




Conclusion

29.         Drawing together  the  above,  although  the  errors  found  are
      relatively narrow in scope, those errors, particularly in the  failure
      to recognise that the Appellant has established a permanent  residency
      in the UK, are sufficient to impact on the findings as a  whole.   For
      that reason, I am persuaded that the errors of law are material and  I
      set aside the Decision.  However, there has been no challenge  to  the
      Judge's findings as to  integrative  links  and  that  the  period  of
      imprisonment has broken such links as might have  existed.   For  that
      reason, I preserve the final sentence of  [32]  of  the  Decision  and
      therefore the finding that the Respondent does not have to  show  that
      there are imperative grounds to deport in this case.  It follows  from
      what I have already said that the Appellant has established that he is
      permanently resident, the Respondent having conceded as much.

NEXT STEPS

30.         I  have  not  received  any  submissions  from  the  Respondent.
      Moreover, the Appellant seeks to rely on further evidence which  I  am
      prepared to allow him to adduce.  Although the impact  of  the  errors
      requires reconsideration of a  number  of  issues  including  risk  of
      reoffending, rehabilitation and proportionality,  I  do  not  consider
      that this appeal needs to be remitted for  rehearing.   I  do  however
      consider that an oral hearing is required.  In the current conditions,
      although there is likely to be  a  need  to  hear  evidence  from  the
      Appellant himself, that hearing can, in my provisional  view  be  held
      remotely.  I have therefore given directions below  for  consideration
      of that course and listing as appropriate.

DECISION
I am satisfied that the Decision involves the making of a material error  on
a point of law. The Decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Davey  promulgated
on 3 January 2020 is set aside save for the final sentence of [32]  of  that
decision.  The appeal will be re-determined by this Tribunal  in  accordance
with the following directions.

           hearing being a remote hearing, giving reasons; and

      (b)   without prejudice to the Tribunal's consideration  of  any  such
           objections, the parties shall also file and serve:

           (i)   Skype contact details and a contact telephone  number  for
                 any person who wishes to attend the hearing remotely, which

                 any other witness and, if so, the language required;
           (iv)  a time estimate and timetable for the hearing,  indicating
                 who it is proposed should be called to give evidence and in
                 what order.

   2. If there is an objection to a remote hearing, the Upper Tribunal  will
      consider  the  submissions  and  will  make  any  further   directions
      considered necessary.

   3. If there is no objection to a remote hearing, the following directions
      supersede any previous case management directions and shall apply.

        i) The parties shall have regard to the Presidential Guidance Note:

           and served with his application dated 5 May 2020.

      iii) The Appellant shall file with the Upper Tribunal  and  serve  on
           the Respondent an electronic skeleton argument within 21 days of
           the date this decision is sent.


       iv) The Respondent shall file with the Upper Tribunal and  serve  on
           the Appellant an electronic skeleton argument within 21 days  of
           the date when the Appellant's skeleton  argument  is  served  on
           her.

        v) The Appellant shall be responsible for compiling and serving  an
           agreed consolidated bundle of documents which both  parties  can
           rely on at the hearing. The bundle should be compiled and served
           in accordance with the Presidential  Guidance  Note  [23-26]  at
           least 7 days before the hearing.


   4. The parties are at liberty to apply to amend these directions,  giving
      reasons, if they face significant practical difficulties in complying.



   5. Documents or submissions filed in response to these directions may  be
      sent by, or attached to, an email  to  [email]  using  the  Tribunal's
      reference number (found at the top of these directions) as the subject
      line.  Attachments must  not  exceed  15  MB.   This  address  is  not
      generally available for the filing of documents.

   6. Service on the Secretary of  State  may  be  to  [email]  and  on  the
      Appellant, in the absence of any contrary instruction, by use  of  any
      address apparent from the service of these directions.
