Representation:

For the claimants:     Ms K Singh, instructed by Duncan Lewis & Co
For the appellant:     Mr A McVeety, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Birk promulgated 1.10.14, allowing, on asylum
    and human rights grounds, the claimants' appeals against  the  decision
    of  the  Secretary  of  State  to  refuse  their  asylum,  humanitarian
    protection and human rights claims.  The  Judge  heard  the  appeal  on
    1.9.14.

 2. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    20.10.14, though without citing any reasons for doing so.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 22.4.15 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein I found that there were errors of law in
    the making of the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  such  that  the
    determination of Judge Birk should be  set  aside  and  remade.  Having
    given my decision on error of law, and having decided to  preserve  the
    core findings of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  up  to  30,  the
    representatives of both parties agreed that there was no need  to  hear
    further evidence before remaking the decision. Ms  Singh  made  further
    submissions at that stage on the two outstanding issues  of  relocation
    and sufficiency of protection. I  then  reserved  my  decision  on  the
    remaking of the appeal and now give both my reasons for finding  errors
    of law and in remaking of the decision by dismissing the appeal.

 5. Judge Birk did not accept the claimants' case on political opinion  but
    accepted the claim based on the claimant being a member of a particular
    social group as the unmarried mother  of  two  children  in  an  extra-
    marital relationship with her partner. On this issue  the  judge  found
    the claimant and her partner credible that there is  hostility  towards
    them from their families. The judge then went on to find  at  �33  that
    the claimants are entitled to refugee status and that there is  also  a
    real risk of breach of articles 2 &  3  on  the  same  factual  matrix.
    Having found that the first claimant is a refugee, the  judge  did  not
    consider whether she is entitled to humanitarian  protection;  however,
    on the facts of this case they are covered by the same  factual  matrix
    and stand or fall together.

 6. I note that the judge found  in  the  article  8  assessment  that  the
    decision of the Secretary of State was proportionate and there has been
    no cross-appeal by the claimant against the human rights  findings  and
    thus that part of the decision must stand as made.

 7. The claimant has not challenged the  political  opinion  findings.  The
    Secretary of State has not challenged any of the core factual findings.
    As stated above, the only real  issues  are  in  relation  to  internal
    relocation and sufficiency of protection, considered in the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision from �29 through �33.

 8. The first ground of application for permission to appeal  asserts  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge made a material misdirection  in  law  in
    the approach taken to the issue of internal relocation, and  failed  to
    follow SSHD v AH Sudan & Others [2007] UKHL 49. In  particular,  it  is
    submitted that in reaching the conclusion at �31 that the claimants are
    unable to relocate  elsewhere  in  Pakistan,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to take into account the types of support that  the  appellant's
    partner Mr A could offer on their return to Pakistan. The judge stated,
    "She has no family members and friends elsewhere who would support  her
    or any other resources that she can access.  So  I  find  that  she  is
    unable to relocate elsewhere in Pakistan." It  is  submitted  that  the
    judge focused material support, irrelevant to the protection issue, and
    gave no reasons to show either that relocation would not be possible or
    that living conditions on  relocation  would  be  so  intolerable  that
    relocation was unjustifiably harsh.

 9. First, there is the support of the claimant's partner. Although he  has
    made an asylum claim the situation had to be considered as at the  date
    of hearing before the First-tier Tribunal in September 2014,  at  which
    time there had been no decision on his claim. He was in  the  UK  as  a
    student and therefore was present on a temporary basis, was now without
    any leave to remain, and could have had no  legitimate  expectation  of
    being able to remain in the UK except in  accordance  with  Immigration
    Rules, which he does not meet. He has no leave to remain in the UK  and
    is thus in theory able to return to Pakistan, as  the  judge  noted  at
    �29.  However,   the   relocation   and   sufficiency   of   protection
    considerations appear to  have  proceeded  as  if  the  claimants  were
    returning to Pakistan without the partner. I was told  today  that  his
    asylum claim has been refused and he is now awaiting an appeal hearing.
    That changes nothing, as I still have to proceed on the same basis that
    the claimants and the partner can return to Pakistan as a family unit.

10. Both appellant and partner have the advantage of education. Even though
    neither of them may have family support or financial resources to  call
    upon in Pakistan, they would be  in  no  different  situation  to  many
    others in Pakistan and in that context can  live  a  relatively  normal
    life consistent with the situation of  the  majority  of  their  fellow
    citizens.

11. At �20 of the refusal decision, the Secretary of State considered  that
    as the claimants had related their fear to  only  their  home  area  of
    Jhelum, it would be reasonable to expect them  to  relocate  elsewhere,
    such as Lahore or Hyderbad, relying on Januzi [2006]  UKHL  5,  to  the
    effect that it would not be unduly harsh if the  claimant  can  life  a
    relatively normal life judged by the  standards  that  prevail  in  his
    country of nationality generally, and AH (Sudan) to similar effect.  As
    stated at �42 of AH (Sudan):

         "If a significant  minority  suffer  equivalent  hardship  to  that
         likely to be suffered by  a  claimant  on  relocation  and  if  the
         claimant is as well able to  bear  it  as  most,  it  may  well  be
         appropriate to refuse him international protection. Hard hearted as
         this may  sound  and  sympathetic  although  inevitable  one  feels
         towards those who have suffered as have these respondents (and  the
         tens of thousands like them), the Refugee  Convention,  as  I  have
         sought to  explain,  is  really  intended  only  to  protect  those
         threatened with specific forms of persecution. It is not a  general
         humanitarian measure.  For  these  respondents  persecution  is  no
         longer a risk. Given that they can now  safely  be  returned  home,
         only proof that  their  lives  on  return  would  be  quite  simply
         intolerable compared even to the problems and  deprivations  of  so
         many of their fellow  countrymen  would  entitle  them  to  refugee
         status. Compassion alone cannot justify the grant of asylum."

12. It is clear from a reading of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    that there was an inadequate and flawed  consideration  as  to  whether
    relocation would be unduly harsh. The judge  focused  on  the  lack  of
    material support they would have on return to Pakistan  and  failed  to
    properly identify what risk factors  or  intolerable  conditions  would
    prevent such relocation. Mere convenience or  absence  of  property  or
    financial resources or family support are  insufficient  to  amount  to
    such hardship as to render relocation unjustifiably harsh.

13. The judge did take into account threats of harm from the family members
    on both sides. At �30  the  judge  accepted  as  credible  the  alleged
    threats from family members to harm the claimant and that the  extended
    family are at all the main airports and that as the two families of the
    first claimant and her partner are from two different  provinces,  they
    have a  wider  family  network  across  Pakistan.  However,  the  judge
    specifically  failed  to  consider  whether  the  family  could  safely
    relocate to other areas outside the two provinces of Pakistan  in  what
    is by any account a huge country. There is no finding that  the  family
    would be unsafe or at  risk  elsewhere  and  in  my  view  insufficient
    evidence that they would not be able to relocate  well  away  from  the
    families of either the claimants or the partner  in  the  vast  country
    that is Pakistan.

14. For the same reasons, I find in remaking the  decision  in  the  appeal
    that whilst the claimants fear the threats of the wider family and that
    of the first claimant's partner, it  has  not  been  demonstrated  that
    there is no part of Pakistan to which they can go where they  will  not
    be at risk from the threateners. Even if they are widespread across two
    particular provinces, it would be stretching  credibility  too  far  to
    suggest without cogent evidence that the influence of these  particular
    families is so widespread across the whole  of  Pakistan  society  that
    there is no place of safety. Nothing has been  demonstrated  that  they
    would have such power or influence to be able to  know  that  they  had
    returned to Pakistan or to have the ability to track them right  across
    the country. For example, the Secretary of State  suggested  that  they
    could relocate to Lahore, the second largest city in  Pakistan  with  a
    population of over 9 million, where the claimants and the partner would
    be able to  live  without  attracting  the  adverse  attention  of  the
    families they fear. There are many other large towns and cities. Whilst
    there may be practical  difficulties  in  relocating  to  a  previously
    unknown area, there is no reason why the claimants, with or without the
    partner, would not be able to lead a relatively normal life  comparable
    to  that  of  a  significant  proportion  of  the   country.   In   the
    circumstances, the  claimants  do  not  have  a  well-founded  fear  of
    persecution or face a real risk of serious harm, because there is place
    to which they can relocate where they will not face that harm and it is
    not unjustifiably harsh to expect  them  to  do  so.  Accordingly,  the
    claimants' removal would not cause the  UK  to  be  in  breach  of  its
    obligations under the Geneva Convention.

15. In passing I find no error of law in the findings of the judge in  �30,
    as complained of in the third ground of application for  permission  to
    appeal. The judge therein set out cogent  reasons  for  accepting  that
    evidence. Mr McVeety conceded that this was not a strong ground and  he
    did not pursue it further than to reference it in the grounds.

16. The second ground of application for  permission  to  appeal  complains
    that at �31 and �32, the judge found that the claimants would not  have
    effective protection in their home area, because the threat is from the
    first claimant's own family members and that on the objective  evidence
    the police would be ineffective in such disputes.  However,  the  judge
    failed to follow the country guidance case of KA  &  Others   (domestic
    violence risk on return) Pakistan  CG  [2010]  UKUT  31  (IAC),  or  AW
    (Sufficiency of protection) Pakistan [2011]  UKUT  31  (IAC),  both  of
    which indicate  that  there  is  no  systemic  insufficiency  of  state
    protection.

17. In KA & Others, the Upper Tribunal held, inter  alia,  that  (iii)  The
    Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act 2006 ("PWA"), one  of
    a number of legislative measures undertaken to improve the situation of
    women in Pakistan in the past decade, has had a significant  effect  on
    the operation of the Pakistan criminal law as it affects women  accused
    of adultery. It led to the release  of  2,500  imprisoned  women.  Most
    sexual offences now have to be dealt with under the Pakistan Penal Code
    (PPC) rather than under the more punitive Offence of Zina  (Enforcement
    of Hudood) Ordinance 1979. Husbands no longer have power to register  a
    First Information Report (FIR) with the police alleging adultery; since
    1 December 2006 any such complaint must be presented to a court,  which
    will require sufficient grounds to be shown for any charges to proceed.
    A senior police officer has to conduct the investigation.  Offences  of
    adultery have been made bailable. However, Pakistan remains  a  heavily
    patriarchal society and levels of  domestic  violence  continue  to  be
    high; (iv) Whether a woman on return faces a real  risk  of  an  honour
    killing will  depend  on  the  particular  circumstances;  however,  in
    general such a risk is likely to be confined to tribal  areas  such  as
    the North West Frontier Province (NWFP) and is unlikely  to  impact  on
    married women;  (vi) The guidance given in SN and HM (Divorced women  -
    risk on return)  Pakistan  CG  [2004]  UKIAT  00283  and  FS  (Domestic
    violence - SN and HM - OGN) Pakistan CG [2006]  000283  remains  valid.
    The network of women's  shelters  (comprising  government-run  shelters
    (Darul Amans) and  private  and  Islamic  women's  crisis  centres)  in
    general affords effective protection  for  women  victims  of  domestic
    violence, although there are significant shortcomings in the  level  of
    services and treatment of inmates in some such centres. Women with boys
    over 5 face separation from their sons; (v) In assessing whether  women
    victims  of  domestic  violence  have  a  viable  internal   relocation
    alternative, regard must be had not only to the  availability  of  such
    shelters/centres but also to the situation women will face  after  they
    leave such centres.

18. AW (sufficiency of protection) Pakistan  [2011]  UKUT  31  (IAC),  also
    indicates that there is no systemic insufficiency of  state  protection
    in Pakistan.

19. I find that without justification for doing  so  the  judge  failed  to
    follow country guidance and focused only on one  extract  from  country
    background information. On the circumstances of  this  case,  with  the
    family able to return together, SN & HM was of marginal  relevance.  As
    Mr Mc Veety submitted, relying on SG (Iraq) v SSHD [2012] EWCA Civ 940,
    at �47, "decision makers and  Tribunal  judges  are  required  to  take
    Country Guidance determinations into account, and to follow them unless
    very  strong  grounds  supported  by  cogent  evidence,   are   adduced
    justifying their not doing so." Judge Birk made  no  reference  to  the
    relevant country guidance on sufficiency of protection in Pakistan  and
    the one reference to the objective material stated no  more  than  that
    police and judges were "sometimes" reluctant to take action in domestic
    violence cases. None of this was sufficient justification for  ignoring
    or departing from the country guidance. In the circumstances, this part
    of the decision is flawed for error of law.

20. In submissions addressed to remaking the decision Ms Singh  pointed  me
    to the 'Country Information and Guidance Pakistan: Women,'  dated  July
    2014 (A58), and in particular the suggestion at 1.3.7  that  whether  a
    woman will face a real risk  of  honour  killing  will  depend  on  the
    particular circumstances, and that whilst KA &  others  suggested  that
    the risk was limited to  tribal  areas,  "more  recent  country  origin
    information indicates that the risk of honour killing  in  Pakistan  is
    not restricted geographically or otherwise." Further at 1.3.8 that  the
    authorities may be unable or unwilling to provide protection for  women
    fearing honour crimes.

21. My attention was also drawn to the various Internet and  press  reports
    in the appellant's bundle as to violence perpetrated against  women  in
    relation  to  domestic  violence,  allegations  of  adultery,  and  the
    prevalence of honour killings. In addition, Ms Singh pointed me to  the
    extract from the 2013 COIR for Pakistan, between A89-96.  Some of  this
    relates to the protection of single women, but I note that at 23.149 it
    is stated to be common for legal authorities including  the  police  to
    mishandle cases involving love marriages or other "family issues,"  for
    which reason violence against women remains very high.

22. I have carefully considered and take all  the  above  information  into
    account in assessing on the merits of this case  whether  there  is  an
    insufficiency of protection. Whilst these extracts indicate that  there
    are sometimes difficulties or challenges in  obtaining  protection  for
    women in the first claimant's situation, there is no  evidence  of  any
    systemic insufficiency of protection in Pakistan such as to  enable  me
    to conclude that KA & others should be departed from.  It  remains  the
    country guidance case. I find insufficient information in the  material
    before me  to  suggest  that  there  would  be  such  insufficiency  of
    protection in all or most parts of Pakistan that the appeals  ought  to
    be allowed on that basis. In Horvath [1999]  EWCA  Civ  3026,   Stuart-
    Smith LJ held that there  must  be  a  criminal  law  in  place  and  a
    reasonable willness by the authorities to detect, prosecute and  punish
    offenders. "It must be remembered that inefficiency and incompetence is
    not the same as unwillingness, unless it is extreme  and  widespread...
    Moreover,  the  existence  of  some  policemen  who  are   corrupt   or
    sympathetic to the criminals, or  some  judges  who  are  weak  in  the
    control of the court or in sentencing, does not mean that the state  is
    unwilling to afford protection. It will require  cogent  evidence  that
    the state which is able to afford protection is  unwilling  to  do  so,
    especially in the case of a democracy." In my  view,  for  the  reasons
    stated in KA & Others, and despite the further evidence  relied  on  by
    the claimants, there is a willingness of the  Pakistan  authorities  to
    provide sufficient protection against the threats of harm feared by the
    claimants.

23. For the same reasons relied on in relation to the asylum claim, I  find
    that the claimants have failed to demonstrate  to  the  lower  standard
    that there are substantial grounds for  believing  that,  if  returned,
    they would face a real risk of suffering serious harm and that they are
    unable or, owing to such risk, unwilling to  avail  themselves  of  the
    protection of the country of return. Thus the  humanitarian  protection
    claim also fails.

24. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal in relation to article 8 stands
    and the decision of the Secretary of State is not  disproportionate  to
    the claimants' rights of private and family life pursuant to article  8
    ECHR when balanced against the legitimate and necessary public interest
    in maintaining immigration control in order  to  protect  the  economic
    well-being of the UK.

Conclusions:

25. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside and remade.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by  dismissing  the
                    appeal of each appellant on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal made  an  order  pursuant  to  rule  45(4)(i)  of  the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I continue the anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable and thus there can be no fee award.
