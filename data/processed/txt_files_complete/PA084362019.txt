                          DECISION AND REASONS (P)

1. The appellant, a citizen  of  Afghanistan,  has  appealed  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal against the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated
   7.11.19, in which First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  EMM  Smith  dismissed  the
   appellant's appeal against the respondent's decision of 14.8.19  refusing
   his further submissions  in  support  of  his  claims  for  international
   protection and humanitarian protection.

2. In essence, the appellant's claim is  that  his  father  worked  for  the
   Taliban but disappeared in 2008. The  Taliban  approached  the  appellant
   seeking revenge, asserting that his father had stolen weapons from  them.
   He claims that he was forced to wear suicide  vests  but  he  surrendered
   himself to the authorities. In consequence, he was beaten by the  Taliban
   and forced again to wear a suicide vest. Eventually, he fled  Afghanistan
   and came to the UK in October 2013 at the age of 13.

3. He first made a claim for  international  protection  in  February  2014,
   which was refused in the decision of the respondent made on  4.2.15,  but
   he was at the same time granted discretionary leave to remain because  of
   his young age. The appellant  appealed  the  refusal  to  the  First-tier
   Tribunal, which dismissed his appeal in  September  2015.  Permission  to
   appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  refused.  On  5.7.19  he  made  further
   submissions, the refusal of which is the subject matter of the appeal  to
   the First-tier Tribunal referred to above.

4. Permission to appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  was  granted  by  First-tier
   Tribunal Judge Simpson on 21.1.20, on the basis that it was arguable that
   the judge gave weight  to  immaterial  matters  arising  at  the  hearing
   concerning the  appellant's  partner's  name  and  the  length  of  their
   relationship, whilst failing to give weight to country information  about
   the Taliban and Afghanistan. It was also found arguable that  the  First-
   tier Tribunal failed to make a compliant article 8  ECHR  proportionality
   balancing exercise, and failed to  "provide  all  round  an  adequacy  of
   reasoning on matters at issue, asylum, humanitarian protection and  human
   rights, private & family life."

5. On 20.4.20 the Upper Tribunal issued directions proposing  that,  because
   of the COVID-19 pandemic, the error of law decision  be  decided  on  the
   papers without an oral  hearing.Both  parties  have  responded  to  those
   directions with written submissions in which it is agreed that the  error
   of law decision can be made without any further hearing. The tribunal has
   received the appellant's unsigned and undated submissions send  by  email
   on 12.5.20, and the  respondent's  submissions  by  Stefan  Kotas,  dated
   19.5.20. It is not necessary to repeat or prï¿½cis the lengthy submissions.
   However, I confirm that both sets  of  submissions  have  been  carefully
   considered and taken into account before making my decision.

6. I have  had  regard  to  the  Senior  President  of  Tribunals'  Practice
   Direction, Pilot Practice  Direction:  Contingency  Arrangements  in  the
   First-tier Tribunal and the Upper Tribunal,  to  the  UTIAC  Presidential
   Guidance Note No 1 of 2020, Arrangements during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,
   and to rule 34 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  (as
   amended). I am satisfied that it is appropriate to determine this  appeal
   without a hearing because both parties are in agreement that the Tribunal
   should do so.

7. I therefore proceed to consider and determine this appeal on the papers.

8. The grant of permission does  not  appear  to  correlate  well  with  the
   drafted grounds of application for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
   Tribunal. Those grounds were drafted in rather vague terms and contain  a
   series of assertions and disagreements with the decision  of  the  First-
   tier Tribunal. It is submitted that the  First-tier  Tribunal  failed  to
   fully consider the content of the evidence as  a  whole  but  it  is  not
   particularised  what  evidence  was  not  properly  taken  into  account.
   Similarly, the grant of permission is somewhat vague and fails to  engage
   adequately with the drafted grounds of application.

9. The appellant's submissions go  beyond  the  grounds  relied  on  in  the
   application  for  permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal.   The
   submissions now rely on UNHCR Guidelines as to the risk on relocation  to
   Kabul. As stated below, the finding that relocation to Kabul would not be
   unreasonable or unduly harsh  was  a  finding  in  the  alternative.  The
   primary finding is that the factual claim is not credible and that  there
   is no reason why the appellant will not be able to return to  his  family
   home. The submissions in this regard do not identify any  material  error
   of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

10. The first argument in the drafted grounds is that the appellant and  his
   partner have formed a strong family and private life in the UK.  However,
   this ground is little more than a disagreement with the findings  of  the
   First-tier Tribunal. When assessing the appellant's overall  credibility,
   the judge at [28] of the decision considered the oral evidence as to that
   relationship. It was pointed out that the  appellant  varied  as  to  the
   length of his relationship with Ms Singh, first stating 3-4  months,  and
   then 2-3 months.  A letter from Ms Singh claimed that she had  known  the
   appellant since 2015. In oral evidence, she said 4-5 months.  The  letter
   in support gave a different name, the explanation  for  which  the  judge
   found incredible. Other evidence suggested that  the  relationship  began
   around June 2019. It was  accepted  at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal
   hearing that the appellant and Ms Singh could not meet  the  requirements
   of Appendix FM in relation to family life, even under the  exceptions  of
   EX1 and EX2. In any event, it does not appear to have been argued by  the
   appellant's representative that there were  insurmountable  obstacles  to
   family life continuing outside the UK. Despite  the  adverse  credibility
   findings, the judge accepted that there was a relationship in existence.

11. With regard to this relationship, the  grounds  also  assert  that  "the
   proportionality assessment and under section 117B(6)" of the Nationality,
   Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 is not fair, because the appellant is  in
   a relationship with his partner. The appellant has provided documentation
   which, it is asserted,  demonstrates  that  the  relationship  cannot  be
   enjoyed  elsewhere.  It  is  claimed  that  the  partner  cannot  go   to
   Afghanistan  because  she  is  Sikh.  It  is  submitted  that  these  are
   exceptional circumstances overriding the  public  interest.  However,  no
   satisfactory evidence was adduced to demonstrate that the  partner  would
   be unable to accompany the appellant to Afghanistan.

12. In support  of  the  exceptional  circumstances  argument,  the  written
   submissions purport to rely  on  post-decision  evidence  relating  to  a
   forced marriage protection order made in  the  UK  when  the  appellant's
   partner was in India and her parents attempted to prevent  her  returning
   to the UK. It is pointed out that the relationship with the appellant  is
   not supported by Ms Singh's parents. However, it is difficult to see  the
   direct relevance of this material. At its highest, it is said that as she
   cannot return safely to India and is not with her parents any  separation
   from the appellant would be harsh.  However,  this  information  was  not
   before the First-tier Tribunal and is not relevant to  the  issue  as  to
   whether there was an error of law  in  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
   Tribunal.

13. The written submissions assert that the judge "failed  to  carry  out  a
   proper  assessment   in   respect   of   the   balancing   exercise   and
   proportionality assessment in respect of the  appellant's  relationship."
   However, the judge did consider the claim outside the Rules, pursuant  to
   article 8 ECHR. The judge accepted on the evidence that the appellant and
   Ms Singh were then in a relationship and  had  been  for  only  some  3-4
   months, so that the relationship was "in its infancy." The judge made  an
   erroneous reference to s117B(6), as do the grounds, as  s117B(6)  relates
   to a parental relationship with a qualifying child when the appellant has
   no such child. In reality, the very recently  formed  relationship  could
   only be regarded as part and parcel of the appellant's private  life.  It
   is likely that the judge intended to refer under section 117B(5)  of  the
   Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  to  the  fact  that  little
   weigh is to be given to  a  private  life  developed  in  the  UK  whilst
   immigration status is precarious, as it  was  even  though  he  had  been
   granted  discretionary  leave.  The  relationship  with  a  partner  that
   commenced whilst the appellant's immigration status  was  precarious,  is
   itself also precarious. Ms Singh must have known from the outset  of  the
   relationship that the appellant had no permanent status in  the  UK  and,
   given that his asylum claim had been refused, was likely to  be  required
   to return to Afghanistan. The couple are not entitled to remain in the UK
   simply because that is their desire. Given its  short  duration  and  the
   circumstances of its creation, in entirely precarious  circumstances,  it
   is obvious that the appeal could never have succeeded on the basis of the
   relationship. The grounds fail to identify in what way the judge made  an
   error of law with regards to this relationship. I agree  that  the  judge
   could have done a better job of setting out and  assessing  the  relevant
   factors in the proportionality balancing exercise. However, on the  facts
   of  this  case,  there  were  no  compelling  circumstances  to  justify,
   exceptionally, granting leave to remain outside the Rules. All  that  has
   been relied on in the grounds and the written submissions are that she is
   estranged from her parents in India and  cannot  return  there.  However,
   that does not render the circumstances in  any  way  compelling.  Neither
   does the unsupported assertion that because she is Sikh she cannot go  to
   Afghanistan amount to compelling circumstances.  There  is,  in  reality,
   nothing unduly or unjustifiably  harsh  in  returning  the  appellant  to
   Afghanistan even though he had established a relationship of  sorts  with
   Ms Singh a few months at the most prior to the  appeal  hearing.  On  the
   facts, I am satisfied that the dismissal of the appeal  on  human  rights
   grounds was in this case inevitable.

14. In relation to the protection claim it is argued that the judge was  too
   harsh in rejecting the appellant's claim to have be  repeatedly  targeted
   by the Taliban to wear a suicide vest. The fact that  the  appellant  has
   given this account in his witness statement  and  oral  evidence  is  not
   indicative of an error of law; the judge was  not  bound  to  accept  his
   account. It is open to the judge to make findings rejecting  the  factual
   claim, provided that cogent reasoning has been provided to support  those
   findings and conclusions. I am satisfied that when read as  a  whole  the
   decision does provide entirely adequate reasoning for  the  decision.  No
   error of law has been identified in respect of this ground,  which  is  a
   mere disagreement with the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.

15. It is also asserted in regard to the background factual claim  that  the
   judge had ample objective evidence to support the appellant's  claim  and
   was, therefore, wrong to dismiss the claim for the reasons stated. Again,
   this  is  little  more  than  a  disagreement  with  the  decision.   The
   appellant's factual claim in relation to fear of the Taliban as presented
   to the First-tier  Tribunal  was,  in  essence,  a  restatement  of  that
   previously considered by the First-tier Tribunal in 2015,  but  supported
   now by CPIN information about the Taliban recruiting young boys. However,
   in 2015 the First-tier Tribunal entirely  rejected  that  claim  and  the
   First-tier Tribunal in 2019 was entitled  to  take  that  as  a  starting
   point, pursuant to the Devalseen principle, as the grounds accept.  Judge
   Smith then went on to consider the CPIN country  background  information,
   accepting both that the Taliban may well be able to  trace  a  person  of
   interest, and that they are known to recruit young boys.  Despite  taking
   that information into account, at [26] of the decision, the  judge  found
   nothing to justify departing from Judge Mathews findings in 2015. Nothing
   in this ground demonstrates any error of law on the part  of  the  First-
   tier Tribunal; the findings were  entirely  open  to  the  judge  on  the
   evidence and were made after consideration of the evidence in the round.

16. The respondent's submissions very fairly point out that at [33]  of  the
   decision the First-tier Tribunal Judge erroneously  applied  the  Country
   Guidance issued by the Upper Tribunal in AS (safety of Kabul) Afghanistan
   CG [2018] UKUT 00118, when the decision had been overturned and  remitted
   by the Court of Appeal. However, the error of the Upper Tribunal  related
   to a numerical miscalculation of risk under article 15(c) in  Kabul.  The
   First-tier Tribunal Judge should have been  aware  of  this.  Whilst  the
   error is not relied on in the grounds, it is not material  on  the  facts
   and findings of this case, as the primary finding is that  the  appellant
   can return to his family home. It was only in the  alternative  that,  at
   [35]  of  the  decision,  the  judge  found  relocation  to   Kabul   not
   unreasonable or unduly harsh. In the circumstances, the error  identified
   by the respondent makes no difference to the outcome of the appeal.

17. In all the circumstances, I  find  no  material  error  of  law  in  the
   decision of the First-tier Tribunal and the appeal must stand as made.

DECISION

18. The appellant's appeal against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
   is dismissed.

19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands and  the  appeal  remains
   dismissed on all grounds.

20. I make no order as to costs.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order  pursuant  to  rule  13(1)  of  the  Tribunal
Procedure Rules 2014.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.
