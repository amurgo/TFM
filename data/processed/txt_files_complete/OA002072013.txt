    Representation:

                            For the Appellant: Ms A Everett a Senior
           Home Office Presenting Officer
          For the Respondent: Mr S Bhanji of counsel instructed by Malik
and Malik

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is the Entry Clearance Officer in Islamabad ("the ECO").
      The respondent is a citizen of Pakistan who was  born  on  5  November
      1980 ("the claimant"). The ECO has been given permission to appeal the
      determination of First-Tier Tribunal Judge  Malone  ("the  FTTJ")  who
      allowed the  claimant's  appeal  against  the  ECO's  decision  of  15
      November 2012 to refuse her entry clearance for settlement in  the  UK
      as the wife of her husband and sponsor, a British citizen present  and
      settled here.


   2. The ECO accepted  that  the  claimant  met  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules except for the financial requirements. She needed to
      show that the sponsor had a gross income of at least �18,600 per annum
      under Appendix FM paragraph E-ECP 3.1. He had  claimed  an  income  of
      52,199 per annum  but  had  not  provided  the  documents  which  were
      required to establish this as set out in the eight sub paragraphs  (a)
      to (h) in paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE.


   3. The claimant appealed and the FTTJ heard  her  appeal  on  5  November
      2013. Both parties were represented and the sponsor gave evidence. The
      FTTJ found the sponsor  to  be  an  honest  and  reliable  witness,  a
      conclusion which the ECO does not  seek  to  dispute.  The  Presenting
      Officer conceded and the FTTJ found that the claimant had  established
      that the sponsor had an income in excess  of  the  �18,600  per  annum
      required  by  Appendix  FM  paragraph  E-ECP  3.1.  The  claimant  had
      submitted specified evidence which satisfied all the  requirements  of
      paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE other than sub paragraphs (c),  (e)  and
      (f).


   4. In paragraph 28 the FTTJ recorded the important concession made by the
      Presenting Officer in the following terms; "(the  Presenting  Officer)
      very properly conceded that the evidence submitted to the ECO  by  the
      appellant when she made her application, demonstrated, on the  balance
      of probabilities, that (the sponsor) had a  gross  annual  income  for
      financial period ending 31 March 2012 in excess of �18,600".


   5. The FTTJ relied on this concession and reached his own conclusion that
      the claimant had established that the sponsor had an income in  excess
      of that required by Appendix FM paragraph E-ECP 3.1. He found that the
      appellant had  established  that  she  met  the  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules. This case was not a "near miss". The non-compliance
      with parts of paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE was de minimis. He allowed
      the appeal under the Immigration Rules.


   6. The FTTJ went on to consider the Article 8 human  rights  grounds.  He
      found that the claimant was  not  able  to  satisfy  the  family  life
      criteria set out in Appendix FM and went on to  consider  the  grounds
      outside these provisions. He took  into  account  the  fact  that  the
      claimant lived in a dangerous and volatile part of Pakistan and had  a
      family life with  the  sponsor  the  development  of  which  had  been
      inhibited by the refusal  of  entry  clearance.  Applying  the  Razgar
      principles set out by the House of Lords the FTTJ found that to refuse
      entry  clearance  to  the  claimant  would   be   a   disproportionate
      interference with family life. As both  the  ECO  and  the  Presenting
      Officer  had  accepted  that  the  sponsor  met  the   annual   income
      requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  the   legitimate   aim   of
      maintaining a firm but fair immigration policy fell away.


   7. The FTTJ allowed the appeal under the Immigration Rules and on Article
      8  human rights grounds.


   8. The ECO applied for and was granted permission to appeal. The  grounds
      argue that the FTTJ erred in law. The claimant  was  not  entitled  to
      succeed unless she could establish that she met  the  requirements  of
      paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE. There  were  good  policy  reasons  for
      insisting on this. The concession made by the Presenting  Officer  was
      not that the appeal  should  be  allowed  outright  either  under  the
      financial requirements or the Article 8 human rights  requirements  of
      the Immigration Rules. There could be no lawful application of any  de
      minimis rule. In reality there had been a  near  miss  and  there  was
      clear authority to show that the claimant could  not  succeed  on  any
      near miss principle.


   9. I have a skeleton argument from Mr Bhanji, an extract from Macdonald's
      Immigration Law and Practice and the judgement of the Supreme Court in
      Patel, Anwar and Alam v SSHD [2013] UKSC 72.


  10. Ms Everett submitted  that  the  concession  made  by  the  Presenting
      Officer in paragraph 28 was not the end of the matter. The Immigration
      Rules still require the claimant to  demonstrate  that  the  financial
      requirements were met in a very particular way. What was said  by  the
      Presenting Officer did not include  a  specific  concession  that  the
      claimant met all the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  In  reply
      to my question Ms Everett accepted that the concession was made in the
      precise terms recorded by the FTTJ in paragraph 28. She did  not  wish
      to go behind this or withdraw the concession. She accepted  that  this
      Tribunal could apply considerations of common law fairness but did not
      accept that this was a case where this should be done.


  11. As to the sub paragraphs which the claimant had not  met,  Ms  Everett
      accepted that subparagraph (c) had been changed on  13  December  2012
      which was after the date of the decision in this case. At the date  of
      the decision in this case (15  November  2012)  the  requirement  was;
      "proof of registration with HMRC as self-employed. This evidence  must
      be  either  an  original  or  certified  copy  of   the   registration
      documentation issued by HMRC". After 13 December 2012 the  requirement
      became  "proof  of  registration  with  HMRC   as   self-employed   if
      available".


  12. It remained common ground that the sponsor had not produced  documents
      to show that he met the full requirements of subparagraph (e)  because
      those which he had produced did not cover the whole  of  the  same  12
      month period as the tax return.


  13. Ms Everett accepted  that  the  FTTJ  was  correct  to  conclude  that
      subparagraph (f) did not apply because the claimant did  not  pay  his
      income from self-employment into a personal bank account. All  he  had
      was the business bank account.


  14. Mr Bhanji submitted that the claimant had established that the sponsor
      met all the requirements of the sub paragraphs other than two, one  of
      which had since been changed to a form which the  sponsor  would  have
      met. The concession made by the Presenting Officer meant that the FTTJ
      was entitled  to  conclude  that  the  claimant  succeeded  under  the
      Immigration  Rules.  The  Concession  covered  not  only  Appendix  FM
      paragraph E-ECP 3.1 but the "satellite"  requirements.  In  any  event
      there was a common law duty of  fairness  which  meant  that  the  ECO
      should not be permitted to  go  behind  the  clear  intention  of  the
      concession. There was no sensible point in requiring the  claimant  to
      make a fresh application. As  to  the  Article  8  grounds,  the  FTTJ
      reached conclusions open to him on the evidence. The claimant and  the
      sponsor had suffered a long period of separation and in the  light  of
      the concession it could not be said that the interests of  immigration
      control required both a fresh application and further delay.


  15. I reserved my determination.


  16. Appendix FM paragraph E-ECP 3.1 provides  that;  "The  applicant  must
      provide specified evidence, from the sources listed in paragraph E-ECP
      3.2 of (a) a specified gross annual income of at least  (i)  �18,600".
      In this case it is not suggested that the requirements  of  E-ECP  3.2
      are not met. The "specified evidence" for a self-employed person  such
      as the sponsor is that set out in paragraph 7 of Appendix FM-SE.


  17. I accept that the concession made by the Presenting  Officer  recorded
      in paragraph 28 needs to be read in the light of what the FTTJ said in
      the preceding paragraph namely;  "As  I  have  already  recorded  (the
      Presenting Officer) did not cross examine (the sponsor). She  did  not
      do so because she accepted that the Notice of Refusal did  not  assert
      that the appellant had failed to demonstrate that  (the  sponsor)  had
      the required gross annual income of 18,600. It only asserted that  she
      had failed to demonstrate he had such income in the prescribed  manner
      i.e. that laid down by Appendix FN-SE (sic). She told me that she  had
      taken instructions from her superiors on the morning  of  the  hearing
      who were of the view that, as the appellant had not  demonstrated  the
      required income in the prescribed manner, (the  Presenting  Officer's)
      stance should be that she should make a further application  supported
      with evidence that did comply with Appendix FM-SE."


  18. If as I find, the intention of Appendix FM paragraph E-ECP 3.1  is  to
      ensure that claimants can show that their  sponsor  has  a  sufficient
      level of income and that the level is  placed  at  �18,600  per  annum
      common law fairness dictates that whilst it would be  permissible  for
      an ECO to say to a claimant "you have not  shown  that  you  have  the
      required level of income because you have not produced  the  specified
      documents" it is inconsistent and unfair to say, as in this  case,  "I
      accept that you have established that you have the required  level  of
      income but you still fail because you have not produced the  specified
      documents to prove it". I find authority for the  proposition  that  a
      decision which is unfair is not in accordance with the  law  in  Naved
      (Student - fairness -  notice  of  points)  [2012]  UKUT  14(IAC)  and
      Sapkota [2011] EWCA Civ 1320.


  19. I find  that  the  concession  made  by  the  Presenting  Officer  was
      sufficient to concede the appeal under the Immigration Rules and  that
      it was open to the FTTJ find that this had been done and to allow  the
      appeal under the Immigration Rules. In the alternative, if  there  was
      any ambiguity in the terms of the concession,  then  these  should  be
      construed against the ECO and in favour of the claimant.


  20. In relation to the decision to allow the appeal  on  Article  8  human
      rights grounds outside the Immigration Rules I find that the FTTJ took
      into account all the factors relevant to proportionality and that  the
      public interest including the interest in the preservation  of  proper
      immigration control was substantially diminished, if not extinguished,
      by what was accepted by the ECO and conceded by the Presenting Officer
      namely that the claimant had established  that  the  sponsor  met  the
      income requirements as well as  all  the  other  requirements  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


  21. I have not been asked to make an anonymity direction and see  no  good
      reason to do so.


  22. I find that the FTTJ did not err in law and I uphold his decision.
