For the Appellant:     Ms J Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms M Thirumaney, Solicitor of Trott & Gentry LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. Mr Saai, the Respondent to this appeal, is a  citizen  of  Syria  whose
    date of birth is recorded as 23rd November 1958.  He  made  application
    to come to the United Kingdom as a medical visitor.  An application was
    also made by his daughter Nour Saie but I am not concerned with her  in
    this matter because there is no appeal  concerning  her  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal and no cross-appeal.

 2. On 29th July 2013 a decision was made to refuse the application against
    which the Appellants appealed.  Their appeal was heard by Judge of  the
    First-tier Tribunal Hussain on 6th May 2014.  He allowed the appeal  of
    Mr Saai but dismissed the appeal of his daughter.

 3. The judge heard evidence from Dr Alsaai, the brother of the  Respondent
    in this appeal.  The Respondent has problems  with  his  eyesight  such
    that it is necessary for him to have treatment from time to time  which
    treatment he has previously received in the United Kingdom.

 4. The Secretary of State in refusing the application was  concerned  that
    insufficient evidence of available funds had  been  provided  and  that
    given the current instability in Syria the Respondent would overstay.

 5. From paragraph 17 through to paragraph  31  the  judge  considered  the
    evidence and made a finding in  respect  of  the  Respondent  that  was
    favourable to him.  He found that human rights were  engaged  and  that
    the Respondent suffered from a degenerative eye condition for which  he
    had received long-term treatment including "on  numerous  occasions  in
    the United  Kingdom".   Importantly  also  he  found  that  unless  the
    Respondent received the treatment in respect of which  he  was  seeking
    entry clearance, "there could be serious impact on his sight".

 6. The judge also recognised that if entry clearance were refused this was
    not a case where the status  quo  would  be  maintained  but  that  the
    eyesight of the Respondent was likely to deteriorate.

 7. On the question of funding the judge dealt with this at  paragraph  23.
    The judge expressed himself in rather strong terms and he said that  he
    was "baffled" by the suggestion of the Entry Clearance Officer that the
    Respondent had not provided satisfactory evidence of his  personal  and
    financial background.  He noted that the Respondent had  said  that  he
    was employed as a consultant for a company earning 50,000 Syrian pounds
    per month and it  was  also  noted  that  the  Respondent  had  savings
    equivalent to �3,100.

 8. There was at one time some difficulty  with  respect  to  some  of  the
    documents which had not been translated but it is clear from  paragraph
    25 that this was remedied and the material bank account to which it was
    found that the Respondent would have access was shown to have a balance
    equivalent to �12,000.  The costs estimated for the treatment that  the
    Respondent would need in  the  United  Kingdom  was  considerably  less
    therefore than  the  amount  of  money  that  was  demonstrated  to  be
    available.  I refer here to paragraphs 26 and 27 of the determination.

 9. In addition there was evidence that the Respondent owns property in the
    United Kingdom in North West London.  Unless he has no equity  in  that
    property it would be difficult to  imagine  that  there  would  not  be
    sufficient even in that to cover the costs of the medical treatment but
    I put that to one side as the judge found that there were in any  event
    sufficient funds available.

10. I turn to the issue whether or not the Respondent would return to Syria
    at the end of the visit.  The judge  noted  that  there  were  previous
    visits to the United Kingdom on more than one occasion and  that  there
    had been compliance with Immigration  Rules.   The  judge  particularly
    recognised  the  instability  in  Syria  at   paragraph   30   of   the
    determination but set against  that  the  fact  that  there  were  good
    reasons offered for wanting to come to  the  United  Kingdom  with  the
    Respondent having family members left behind and indeed all the more so
    now given that the Second Appellant in the First-tier Tribunal was  not
    given leave and has not  sought  to  appeal.   And  so  the  judge  was
    satisfied on the totality of the evidence that the Respondent had  made
    out his case.

11. Not content with that determination the Secretary of State,  by  Notice
    dated 30th June 2014, made application for permission  to  appeal.   It
    was submitted that the judge had failed to give  adequate  reasons  why
    the treatment could not be obtained in Syria.  It was  also  said  that
    there was an absence of consideration to say that the treatment was not
    available in Syria and therefore it would be a breach of Article 8.

12. On 10th July 2014 Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Davidge  granted
    permission and thus the matter comes before me.

13. I have to decide in the first instance whether there is on the face  of
    the determination a material error of law and the question I ask myself
    is whether on the evidence the findings  were  open  to  the  judge  or
    whether it can be said that they were if not  perverse  and  irrational
    made in the absence of sufficient evidence which is the  contention  of
    the Secretary of State.

14. Against that I am told on behalf of the Respondent that the issue as to
    whether or not treatment was available in Syria was not  raised  at  an
    earlier stage. I also remind myself that in justifying any interference
    in an article 8 right, the burden was upon the Secretary of  State.  Ms
    Isherwood did not point to any particular evidence that was relied upon
    by the Secretary of State at the hearing below. It seems to me that the
    judge looking to the totality of the  evidence  was  entitled  to  have
    regard to the letter dated 19th June 2013 from the Respondent's  doctor
    in Syria who advised that the treatment would be  better  performed  in
    the United Kingdom, indeed he  went  so  far  as  to  say,  "I  do  not
    recommend that he receives this treatment  in  Syria".   That  was  the
    assessment of the treating doctor in Syria.  It was open of  course  to
    him or her to say that the treatment would be available  but  that  was
    not the recommendation.  The treating  doctor  in  Syria  had  had  the
    Respondent under his or her observation for the previous  seven  months
    but had noted  that  the  condition  had  become  more  recently  "very
    serious".  There is no reason to suppose that if it were  that  serious
    that the Syrian doctor would not have taken steps to perform,  or  have
    performed, the necessary procedures in Syria were it possible,  and  so
    it seems to me entirely open to the judge to come  to  the  conclusions
    which he did. It was never part of the Secretary of State's  case  that
    the Respondent's eye sight was not deteriorating; the evidence  pointed
    in favour of the Respondent - he had previous treatment, which was  not
    in dispute.

15. Although at first Ms Isherwood sought to persuade me in  reliance  upon
    guidance in the case of AAO v Entry Cleance  Officer  [2011]  EWCA  Civ
    840, that Article 8 ECHR was not engaged in this appeal at  all,  after
    some discussion, it became common  ground  that  it  was  open  to  the
    Respondent to rely on Article 8 and that the five stage approach  in  R
    (Razgar) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005] UKHL 27 at
    para. 17:

         "In a case where removal is resisted  in  reliance  on  article  8,
         these questions are likely to be: (1) will the proposed removal  be
         an interference by a public authority  with  the  exercise  of  the
         applicant's right to respect for his private or (as  the  case  may
         be)  family  life?  (2)  If  so,  will   such   interference   have
         consequences of such gravity as potentially to engage the operation
         of article 8? (3) If so, is such interference  in  accordance  with
         the law? (4) If so, is such interference necessary in a  democratic
         society in the interests of national security, public safety or the
         economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder
         or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
         protection of the rights and freedoms of others? (5) If so, is such
         interference proportionate to the legitimate public end  sought  to
         be achieved?"

16. Ms Isherwood was in my judgment right  to  abandon  her  argument  that
    Article 8 was not engaged in the instant appeal. The case  of  AAO  was
    based upon an entirely different set of facts and concerned family life
    between adult relatives. That Article 8 ECHR is relevant in a case such
    as the one before me was specifically  discussed  in  the  case  of  MF
    (Article 8 - new rules) [2012] UKUT 393 at paragraph 23 and whilst that
    case went on appeal, that particular point remains good.

17.  In  my  judgment,  when  one  looks  to  those  five   questions   the
    determination is  unimpeachable.   The  judge  carefully  examined  the
    evidence.  Although he did not set out Razgar  in  terms  it  is  clear
    reading the determination as a whole that one is  able  to  elicit  the
    answers to those questions from it. The first question is  answered  by
    recognising that refusal of entry clearance denies the appellant access
    to medical treatment recommended  to  him  (see  paragraph  19  of  the
    determination). The second, by the fast deterioration in the vision  of
    both eyes which would occur  without  the  necessary  treatment,  which
    treatment was not recommended should be received in Syria.  (The  Judge
    actually dealt expressly with the first questions at  paragraph  20  of
    the determination.) The  third  question  is  easily  answered  in  the
    affirmative in that it is open  generally  to  the  United  Kingdom  to
    refuse entry clearance in appropriate cases.  The  fourth  question  is
    dealt with by the consideration of the judge of the financial resources
    available to the appellant which were found sufficient. Finally in  the
    proportionality issue the judge found that the risk of blindness to the
    appellant weighed against all other factors including  the  turmoil  in
    Syria but the favourable immigration history of  the  Respondent  meant
    that the decision of the Appellant  was  disproportionate.  These  were
    findings open to the judge on the basis of the available  evidence.  It
    was, of course, open to the Appellant to produce evidence in  rebuttal.
    The Judge did the best he could on  the  available  evidence.  For  the
    avoidance of doubt, however, it is likely that I would have come to the
    same view.

Decision

18. In the circumstances the appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
