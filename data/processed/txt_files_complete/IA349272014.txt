For the Appellant:     Mr R Sharif (Solicitor)
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart (HOPO)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Mathews, promulgated on 20th November 2014, following  a  hearing
    at Stoke-on-Trent on 6th November  2014.   In  the  determination,  the
    judge allowed the appeal of Muhammad Ali.  The Respondent Secretary  of
    State, subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to  appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.



The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who was  born  on  29th
    July 1991.  He appeals against the decision of the Respondent Secretary
    of State dated 20th August 2014, rejecting the Appellant's  application
    for leave to remain in the UK as a Tier  4  (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the points-based system.

The Appellant's Claim

 3. The Appellant's claim is that he entered the UK lawfully on 6th October
    2011.  He had leave to remain as a student until 21st  June  2014.   On
    16th June 2014, he made his application, including with it a  CAS  from
    the Midlands Academy of Business and Technology, for the  study  of  an
    extended diploma in business management.  However, his college told him
    to  await  the  results  of  his  application,  and  only  then  learnt
    subsequently that the CAS had  been  withdrawn  when  he  received  his
    reasons for refusal on 20th  August  2014.   He  has  in  the  meantime
    contacted alternative colleges but has been told  that  they  will  not
    consider an application from him without a letter from  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State extending his leave for a period  to  allow  him  to
    find an alternative course provider.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge observed that, although the CAS had been withdrawn, "there is
    no evidence that the withdrawal was in any way linked  to  any  adverse
    behaviour of the Appellant", so that, "I find that the Appellant is not
    at fault in relation to the withdrawal" (paragraph 14).  The Judge also
    observed that there was a policy of the Respondent Secretary  of  State
    to allow a further 60  day  period  to  an  Appellant  whose  college's
    licence had been revoked, in order to enable such a person to  find  an
    alternative, "in the event of a CAS becoming invalid" (paragraph 15).

 5. The judge went on to hold that the Appellant had  not  had  the  policy
    applied to him because "the Respondent has not written to the Appellant
    prior to the reasons for refusal".  The Home Office Presenting Officer,
    Miss Alford, had not disputed this fact, and that the Appellant had not
    been told of the CAS withdrawal prior to the reasons  for  refusal,  so
    that he  did  not  enjoy  the  60  day  period  of  grace  set  in  the
    Respondent's policy.  (Paragraph 16).

 6. The judge allowed the appeal.

Grounds of Application

 7. The grounds of application state that  the  judge  misdirected  herself
    because the so called "60 day policy" operated by the Home Office  only
    applied in a situation where the Sponsor's licence had been revoked  by
    the Secretary of State.  In  this  case,  however,  the  CAS  had  been
    withdrawn by the college itself, and this  was  a  matter  between  the
    college and the Appellant student, rather than have anything to do with
    the Secretary of State having revoked the  licence  of  the  sponsoring
    institution.

 8. On 14th January 2015, permission to appeal was granted on this basis.

Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 15th  May  2015,  Mr  Smart,  appearing  on
    behalf of the Respondent Secretary of  State,  suggested  that  he  had
    taken time to speak with Mr Sharif,  who  appeared  on  behalf  of  the
    Appellant, and it appeared that there was a dispute as to  the  precise
    chronology of facts in this matter.  Mr Smart submitted that,  although
    the Appellant's sponsoring institution's licence had been revoked, this
    had been  done  only  after  the  college  had  already  withdrawn  the
    Appellant's  CAS,  because  this  was  a  college   which   was   under
    surveillance by the Secretary of State, with a large number of students
    who were being monitored for non-attendance, and where  there  appeared
    to be a degree of abuse, which did eventually result in  the  college's
    licence  being  revoked.   The  college  was   aware   it   was   under
    surveillance, and it may itself have therefore withdrawn the CAS of the
    Appellant in order to protect  itself.   Although  the  refusal  letter
    confirms on 20th August  2014  that  the  college's  licence  has  been
    revoked, its licence had already been suspended on 24th June 2014,  the
    effect of which is to retain  intact  the  CAS  so  as  to  enable  the
    affected students to continue studying, but the college  then  withdrew
    the Appellant's CAS on 30th June 2014.

10. Second, Mr Smart submitted that there was credence to  the  proposition
    that the college was already contemplating the withdrawal  of  the  CAS
    long before the licence of the college was revoked by the Secretary  of
    State.  This is clear from the document in the Respondent's bundle "CAS
    details" which contains a statement at the top of the page of  "Warning
    - the Sponsor's licence is revoked".   Underneath  this  heading  is  a
    subheading of "CAS number and status".  This goes on to show  that  the
    current CAS status of the Appellant, at the time of the making  of  the
    decision by the Secretary of State to revoke the licence, was one which
    was described as "withdrawn".  The date of this state  of  affairs  was
    "30th June 2014".

11. Third, Mr Smart had himself taken the trouble to  write  an  e-mail  to
    Roxanna Cram, the compliance manager, at UK Visas and Immigration, Home
    Office.  In this e-mail, he had asked on 14th May 2015, to confirm  the
    circumstances in which the CAS was withdrawn.  The reply  from  Roxanna
    Cram  was  that,  "I  can  confirm  that  the  student  was   withdrawn
    sponsorship by the college, not by UKVI, if we take action on a CAS  as
    a result of revocation it is marked as 'cancelled'".

12. For his part, Mr Sharif submitted that he could do no  better  than  to
    reply upon his Rule 24 reply (at pages 1 to 3 of the bundle).  He  said
    that the chronology was clear that on 24th June 2014,  the  licence  of
    the college was suspended by UKVI.  Four days after that,  the  college
    withdrew the Appellant's CAS on 30th June 2014.  The UKVI had a list of
    students at the college that they were concerned about as  abusing  the
    visas that had been granted to them,  but  the  present  applicant,  Mr
    Muhammad Ali, was not one of them.  The revocation of the licence  came
    first, because the suspension had already come into effect on 24th June
    2014, and the withdrawal of the CAS happened afterwards.  Second, there
    was clear evidence that the withdrawal by the college of  the  CAS  did
    not occur first, from page 105 of the Appellant's  bundle  of  6th May
    2015.

13. This shows that on 18th August 2014, the Appellant is making  inquiries
    of the college himself in terms that, "Hi Fatma, can you please tell me
    the current status and situation of college my visa is  still  in  Home
    Office haven't received any reply so is the college  back  on  list  or
    not??".

14. The reply from Fatma is,

         "Hi Muhammad, the  college  licence  is  still  suspended  but  our
         current students continue their studies.  We are expecting a  reply
         from Home Office very soon.  I can understand that you are worried,
         but the best thing to do is to carry on your  studies.   They  will
         probably not process your application until they  make  a  decision
         about our licence".

15. Following this, on 28th August 2014,  the  Appellant  writes  again  to
    Fatma to ask, "Can you please now tell me the current status of college
    please".  Fatma replies to this in terms, "Hi  Muhammad,  we  are  very
    sorry that the college's  licence  was  revoked  and  subsequently  the
    college had to be closed down a week ago on 22nd August.  If  you  have
    further inquiries please contact Mr Ahmed ...".

16. It is, of course, not clear from this that the Appellant was  attending
    the college at the time  that  he  was  making  inquiries.   Mr  Sharif
    submitted that he was and there is no evidence to the contrary that  he
    was not.

17. But Mr Sharif's case was that the e-mails provide clear evidence  of  a
    concerned applicant who is inquiring of his college about the status of
    the college with respect to the Home Office, and he  is  being  assured
    that, although their licence  is  suspended,  their  students  continue
    their studies, and the advice is that  he  also  continues  to  do  so.
    There is no suggestion in any of these e-mails that the Appellant's CAS
    has been withdrawn.  On the contrary, he has been told to continue with
    his studies at the college.

18. In reply, Mr Smart submitted that the e-mails raise far more  questions
    than the answer because it is not clear what the  Appellant  is  doing,
    and at one stage Fatma is asking of the Appellant to provide  her  with
    his "student ID number" because she does not know who she  is  speaking
    to.

No Error of Law

19. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  It is not the function of this Tribunal to make a finding of
    fact in circumstances where those findings have already been made by an
    original fact-finding Tribunal, unless it  can  first  be  demonstrated
    that there is an error of law.

20. There is obviously a divergence of opinion, backed  up  by  documentary
    evidence from both sides, in the submissions of both Mr Sharif  and  Mr
    Smart.  Mr Sharif states that the e-mails of 18th and 28th August  make
    it quite clear that the Appellant was  actively  seeking  clarification
    from his own college about the position of the  college  vis-�-vis  the
    UKVI, and he was most assuredly told that he should continue  attending
    college, which could only be correct if his CAS was intact.

21. Mr Smart, on the other hand, submits that his own research and  inquiry
    with Roxanna Cram, a day before the hearing, confirms that the CAS  did
    not have an entry on it of "cancelled" which would be the case, if  the
    cancellation had happened through the UKVI.

22. What is clear, however, is that the judge's own  determination  of  the
    facts, on the basis of the evidence as heard by  the  judge,  is  that,
    "there is no evidence that the withdrawal was in any way linked to  any
    adverse behaviour of the Appellant.  I find that the Appellant  is  not
    at fault in relation to the withdrawal" (paragraph 14).  The judge  was
    clear that, "the Appellant had not been  told  of  the  CAS  withdrawal
    prior to the reasons for  refusal"  (paragraph  16),  and  nothing  has
    transpired today that suggests  that  this  is  not  correct.   On  the
    evidence before the judge, the judge found  that  the  revocation  took
    place without the Appellant having  been  informed  of  the  applicable
    policy allowing him 60 days' period of grace.  That was a finding  that
    was open to the judge.

Notice of Decision

23. There is no material error of law in  the  original  judge's  decision.
    The determination shall stand.

24. No anonymity order is made.
