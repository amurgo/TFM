For the appellant :  Mr  R.  Andr�,  Counsel,  instructed  by  White  Ryland

For the respondent : Miss T. Hart, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant  is  a  national  of  Afghanistan.  He  appeals  to  the
      Tribunal against  a  determination  of  Adjudicator,  Ms  J.  Balloch,
      dismissing his appeal against a decision giving directions for removal
      following refusal to grant asylum.

2.    The basis of the appellant's claim was that he was a Tajik  who  lived
      in Bakhi in the north of Afghanistan. In early 2001 during the  period
      when the town was under the rule of the   Taliban  he  was  approached
      secretly by a  Commander Halibullah of the Jamiat-i-Islam  who  wanted
      him to hide weapons in the appellant's  home. The  Commander knew that
      the appellant  hated  the   Taliban  for  having  killed  his  father.
      However, the appellant refused because he did not want to be  involved
      with the  military. Subsequently the appellant was taken  against  his
      will to fight for the  Taliban. In the event he only had to do  menial
      tasks and was able after  2  months  to  escape  and  return  home  in
      November 2001  when  the  Taliban  was  defeated.  Shortly  after  the
      Commander came to his house and accused   the  appellant  of  being  a
      traitor for having fought  for  the   Taliban.  He  shouted  that  the
      appellant was a traitor and he was going to kill  him.  The  appellant
      was in hiding in the back of the  house. He escaped and went  to  hide
      at his uncle's house in another part of town. His mother told him that
      the  Commander and his men came again on other occasions  looking  for
      him.  The appellant stayed in hiding at his  uncle's  house  and  left
      Afghanistan on 15 April  2002.   There  was  also  an  arrest  warrant
      against him. The  Commander was a powerful man and  was  part  of  the
      transitional government.  If he was stopped in Kabul  and  questioned,
      it would be known that he came from the north and checks could be made
      with the authorities.

3.    The Adjudicator accepted that the appellant was  a  Tajik  from  Bakhi
      whose father had been killed by the  Taliban;  that he along with many
      other young men was forced to go with the Taliban to fight  for  them;
      and that he may have been asked by the Commander to hide  weapons  and
      the Commander may have been angry with the appellant for  his  failure
      to do so.

4.     However,  beyond  this,  she  found  his  account  not  credible.  In
      particular she did not accept the appellant  had  been  of  continuing
      interest to the Commander or the authorities, nor did she accept  that
      an arrest warrant had been issued as a result of the Commander's  wish
      for revenge.

5.    The main points raised in the  grounds of appeal and expanded upon  by
      Mr Andre were that the Adjudicator had failed to recognise that in the
      appellant's home  area  he  would  have  remained  a  target  for  the
      Commander; that he failed to take proper account of the fact that  the
      Commander had influence in Kabul and was indeed  an important part  of
      the  Interim Administration; and that he had given insufficient weight
      to materials indicating that Kabul was unsafe.  Mr Andre  also  relied
      on a May 2004 ECRE report and very recent evidence as to the situation
      in Afghanistan brought to light at the recent  NATO summit in Istanbul
      in late June 2004. It was Mr Andre's  submission  that  the  appellant
      fell into more than one continuing risk category as identified by ECRE
      and others.

6.    Miss Hart for the respondent asked us to  uphold  the  appeal  on  the
      basis that the Adjudicator had reached sustainable conclusions.

7.    In relation to risk in the appellant's home  area,  we  consider  that
      the Adjudicator was quite entitled to conclude that  even  before  the
      appellant left there, the Commander no longer had a continuing adverse
      interest in him. It was entirely open to the Adjudicator to find that,
      if the  Commander were set  on  vengeance  against  the  appellant  as
      claimed, he would not have delayed coming to his  house  until   April
      2002. On the appellant's own account he had returned to his home  area
      in November 2001.  The appellant dated his refusal to hide weapons  as
      being in early 2001.  We also consider sustainable  the  Adjudicator's
      assessment that the  Commander would not in fact  have  perceived  the
      appellant as a traitor. Not only did  he  know  that  the  appellant's
      father  had been killed by the  Taliban;  it was also common knowledge
      that many young men (like the appellant) had been forced to fight  for
      the  Taliban against their will.

8.    There was produced before the Adjudicator  an  arrest  warrant  issued
      against the appellant said to have been delivered to  the  appellant's
      home  some three  months  after  it  was  issued.   Mr  Andr�  in  his
      submissions did not seek to rely on this document. In our view he  was
      right not to do so. The Adjudicator gave sound  reasons  for  doubting
      its authenticity.

9.    Even had we concluded that the Adjudicator was wrong to conclude  that
      the appellant had not shown a real risk of serious harm  in  his  home
      area, we would still  not  have  allowed  the  appeal.  We  are  fully
      prepared to accept that Commander Hallibullah is  a  warlord  who  now
      forms part of the Interim Administration.  However, we do not consider
      that the  objective  evidence  demonstrates  that  a  Commander  in  a
      Northern Province of Afghanistan is able to exercise influence  within
      the  capital so as to place all those with whom  he  has  a  score  to
      settle on wanted lists.  Even on the appellant's own account,  all  he
      had done was refuse to conceal weapons at  a point in  time  when  the
      Commander was a warlord engaged in armed conflict with  the   Taliban.
      The appellant plainly did not pose any kind of security threat to  the
      Commander. If the appellant chose not to return to his home  area,  he
      would be able to  live  in  Kabul  without  any  real  risk  of  being
      identified as someone of adverse interest to Commander Hallibullah.

10.   So far as what would happen to  the  appellant  on  return  to  Kabul,
      therefore, we consider that the Adjudicator dealt adequately with  the
      relevant risk factors.

11.   It may be that at some point the authorities in Kabul  might  question
      the appellant about his past and learn, therefore, that  he  had  been
      forced to fight for the Taliban. However, if they discover this  much,
      they will also discover that, like many other young man  in  his  home
      area, he was forced to fight for the  Taliban  and  indeed  that  this
      organisation was responsible for the  death  of  his  father.  On  the
      appellant's own account he had never in any event  had  to  engage  in
      actual combat: his duties  were  confined  to  menial  tasks  such  as
      cooking and cleaning. Even had the appellant been engaged  in  combat,
      his role in the Taliban would only have been low-level. The  objective
      evidence does not indicate that the authorities in Afghanistan have an
      adverse interest in former low-level members of the Taliban.

12.    The  Adjudicator  found  by  reference  to  the  evidence  from   the
      International Crisis Group (ICG) reported in the CIPU Report  that the
      appellant would not be at risk as  a Tajik in  Kabul.  We  agree.  The
      objective evidence does not establish that  Tajiks  face  any  serious
      threats in Kabul by virtue of their ethnic identity.

13.   Mr Andr� asked us to look afresh at  the  general  security  situation
      in Kabul as analysed in the recent ECRE document and as  described  in
      media coverage of the recent NATO summit in Istanbul  where  President
      Kharzai gave an important address.

14.   However, insofar as the ECRE document is concerned we do not  consider
      that it accurately reflects the position as set out in  CIPU  and  the
      major country reports. Indeed it seems to us  that  several  of  their
      categories  are far too widely drawn, e.g. "[f]ormer  members  of  the
      Taliban".   This quite unjustifiably fails  to  differentiate  between
      low level and higher-level former members of the  Taliban.  We  prefer
      the far more widely sourced assessment set  out  in  the   April  2004
      Afghanistan  Country   Report  at  paragraphs  6.314  -  6.321.    The
      appellant in this case is simply a young man of Tajik ethnicity  whose
      father had been killed by the Taliban and who himself had been  forced
      to perform menial task for them over  a period of several months.

15.   Insofar as it is asserted that  these  recent  materials  address  the
      general security situation in Kabul, we are not  persuaded  that  they
      demonstrate that returnees in general face  a  real  risk  of  serious
      harm.  The Adjudicator based his assessment on a careful appraisal  of
      the  CIPU Report, which  encapsulated UNHCR and  ICG documents. We  do
      not see  that the latest documents   cast  a  significantly  different
      light. Indeed, if previous evidence showed  that   ISAF  has  not  had
      sufficient numbers of troops or enough military  equipment,  the  June
      2004 NATO Summit saw a commitment from NATO members to increasing  its
      troops level (currently 6,500)  and  equipment.  To  the  extent  that
      threats from remnants of the  Taliban remain of  concern,  reports  on
      the  NATO Summit reveal that the  US has recently doubled  the  number
      of troops (from 10,000 to 20,000) operating under  Operation  Enduring
      Freedom.

16.   As regards the general social and economic situation in Kabul,  it  is
      clear that there are ongoing hardships, no doubt added to by the large
      number of refugees who have returned to live in Kabul since late 2001.
      However the new materials fall well short of establishing that  for  a
      person such as the appellant return would expose him to a real risk of
      destitution or other forms of serious harm.

17.   For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed.
