                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Secretary of State  appeals  against  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Devittie in a case that was heard on 4 October 2016.  It
    resulted in the promulgation of his determination on 8  November  2016.
    The appeal was the appeal of Zada Noor, IA/31241/2015.

 2. I shall refer to Mr Noor as the appellant as he was before  the  First-
    tier Tribunal.  He is a national of Pakistan and was born on  24  March
    1978.  He is now 39 years old.  He arrived in  the  United  Kingdom  in
    February 2006, that is now some eleven years ago (It was ten  years  at
    the date of hearing.)  He had had leave to remain as a student until 31
    May 2007 and subsequently received  further  extensions  as  a  student
    ending on 23 July 2014.  During his student years  I  assume  that  the
    medium of tuition was English.  The relevant decision was made  by  the
    Secretary of State on 9 September 2015.  It was made at a time when the
    appellant had been in the United Kingdom for 9 ï¿½ years.

 3. The decision was made on the basis  of  the  ETS  certificate  and  the
    appellant had been found to  have  used  a  proxy  test  taker  by  the
    Secretary of State on the basis of what we all  now  refer  to  as  the
    generic evidence.  The generic evidence was the same as  that  provided
    in a number of other cases but  augmented  by  additional  material  to
    which I shall subsequently return.

 4. In his witness statement the appellant had stated that he had been in a
    relationship with a British citizen since July 2010, that  is  now  for
    some seven years and that he had never used deception in the test  that
    he took on 17 July 2012.  When that test was taken in 2012 he had  been
    in the United Kingdom for some six years and during that  time  he  had
    been studying.

 5. The appellant gave evidence.  He accepted that he had undertaken  three
    English language tests the first two of which he had  failed  and  that
    the third test was arranged by an agent and he attended classes with an
    agent to prepare him for those tests.  His partner accompanied  him  to
    the test.  He described how he was given a computer to use  on  arrival
    and he was able to describe the major content  of  the  questions  that
    were asked.  He also gave evidence to the effect that he had  passed  a
    'Life in the United Kingdom' test and that he and his partner, who  was
    a British citizen, used, and only used, English as the method by  which
    they communicated and that they had been in a relationship since 2010.

 6. The position by the time the case was promulgated on  8  November  2016
    had been substantially settled by the decision of the Court  of  Appeal
    in Qadir v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016]  EWCA  Civ
    1167.  That had been an appeal against the  decision  of  the  Tribunal
    which we now know to be SM and Qadir v Secretary of State for the  Home
    Department (ETS - Evidence - Burden of Proof) [2016]  UKUT  229  (IAC).
    The decision of the Court of Appeal in Qadir  effectively  settled  the
    position.  It was the judgment of Beatson LJ that provided the reasoned
    decision.  The appeal was brought by the Secretary of State against the
    determination of the Upper Tribunal in SM and Qadir.  That itself was a
    decision of the President of the IAC and of Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge
    Saini.

 7. The challenges advanced by the Secretary of State in the appeal to  the
    Court of Appeal were numerous but the great  majority  related  to  the
    evidence supplied by the Secretary of State to prove that  the  English
    language qualifications recorded in the  TOEIC  certificates  had  been
    obtained by deception and fraud in the use of proxy test  takers.   The
    Secretary of State had relied on the same evidence as was submitted  in
    this case and that was the evidence of Ms Collings and Mr Millington.

 8. That evidence had also been considered by the Court of  Appeal  in  the
    case of Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department  v  Shehzad  and
    Chowdhury [2016] EWCA Civ 615.  That case determined that  the  generic
    evidence relied upon by  the  Secretary  of  State  was  sufficient  to
    discharge the initial  evidential  burden  of  proof  placed  upon  the
    Secretary of State of proving deception in an ETS appeal.

 9. The Court of Appeal then went on to deal with whether there was a legal
    burden that had to be discharged.  The Upper Tribunal in  Qadir's  case
    determined in favour of the two appellants before the Court of  Appeal.
    Those were Mr Majumder and Mr Qadir.   It  found,  albeit  by  a  small
    margin - a 'narrow margin', as it  described  it  -  that  the  initial
    evidential burden had been discharged in favour  of  the  Secretary  of
    State that deception had been  used.   However,  it  then  went  on  to
    consider whether the evidential burden placed  upon  the  appellant  of
    raising an innocent explanation had been discharged.

10. The Upper Tribunal considered  both  the  evidence  of  the  appellants
    themselves and the expert  evidence  of  Dr  Harrison.   They  provided
    explanations that the Tribunal found were both plausible  and  truthful
    and in paragraph 19 of the decision of the Court of  Appeal  the  Court
    records the findings made by the  Upper  Tribunal  that  there  was  no
    suggestion that the claimant's evidence was  false  or  that  they  had
    falsified or forged any documents submitted in support of their  claim.
    In particular, Mr Majumder had given oral evidence in  English  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal and the opportunity of assessing his demeanour  and
    the oral evidence that he had provided was afforded  to  the  Tribunal.
    There was no evidence of invention,  exaggeration  or  evasiveness  and
    that he consistently presented himself as a witness of truth.

11. It was therefore said in Mr Majumder's case that he had discharged that
    evidential burden such that the Secretary of State failed to  discharge
    the ultimate legal burden that remained  upon  her,  the  Secretary  of
    State's shoulders.  Very much the same thing  occurred  in  Mr  Qadir's
    case.  His evidence had been accepted and the conclusion made  in  each
    of the cases was that the evidential burden which  had  initially  been
    established by the evidence produced by the Secretary of State did  not
    result in the legal burden being eventually disposed of in favour of  a
    finding of deception.  Consequently the Court of Appeal  held  that  it
    was open to the Upper Tribunal to determine that the Secretary of State
    had failed to make out her case on deception.

12. The situation in the current appeal has striking similarities  in  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge found that the appellant was a witness on
    whose evidence he could rely, that there was no suggestion that he  was
    able to detect that his evidence was false or that any false  documents
    had been used in support of the claim and he  was  not  persuaded  that
    there was evidence of invention, exaggeration or evasiveness.  At least
    there are no such findings in any part of the  determination.   Instead
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge gave six separate reasons in paragraph 14
    why he did  not  take  the  view  that  the  appellant's  evidence  was
    defective in some way.  In paragraph 15 he reached his  conclusions  as
    to whether there had been provided an innocent explanation.

13. In the course of the hearing before me this morning it became  apparent
    that the Secretary of State's challenge was that these reasons had  not
    properly been articulated and that they were unlawful in the sense that
    there was no basis upon which the  judge  was  entitled  to  treat  his
    explanation as a credible, innocent explanation.

14. In paragraph 14(i) the  judge  records  that  the  appellant  had  been
    questioned closely in cross-examination on the contents  of  the  test,
    the type of questions asked, the venue and  the  location.   Whilst  he
    does not say exactly what the answers were, he concluded that there was
    nothing in the answers that had been provided  to  suggest  that  those
    answers were untrue.  He was guided by the respondent, who did  not  in
    his submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State appear  to  suggest
    that any of those answers were untruthful.  The judge himself looked at
    the demeanour of the witness and was satisfied  that  his  evidence  in
    response to questions put to him was 'generally satisfactory'.

15. Insofar as the appellant had sought to provide an explanation,  he  had
    provided an explanation and there was no material that  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge was able to detect  that  suggested  that  material  was
    wrong.  That finding of course has to be weighed  against  the  generic
    evidence and it was that essential balancing of the material  that  the
    judge was obliged to undertake.

16. He  also  took  into  account  that  the  appellant  had  displayed  an
    impressive degree of fluency.  We know that this should not be taken as
    being evidence that the test was necessarily taken by  the  person,  in
    this case the appellant, who said he took the test.   There  may  be  a
    number of reasons why somebody would wish to employ a proxy test taker.
     Some of those reasons might be that it was simply more convenient  and
    was likely to be a guarantee of success.

17. The judge also took into account that he was not qualified to make  any
    assessment of his proficiency in English and  that  there  had  been  a
    considerable period of time between the time the test was taken in 2012
    and the hearing of the appeal in October 2016 during which  period  the
    appellant was likely to have bettered his English language skills.

18. He also took into account, and this is noted in subparagraph  (iii)  of
    paragraph 14,  the  appellant's  evidence,  supported  by  the  partner
    herself, that she was a British citizen, born in the United Kingdom and
    was only able to speak English and that their communications had at all
    times been only in the English language.  He was also  minded  to  take
    into account, as he was entitled to, the  evidence  that  she  gave  in
    support of her partner's claim insofar  as  it  was  developed  in  the
    course of their relationship since 2010.

19. The judge also took into account that the appellant had taken two tests
    which he had failed  in  the  past.   This  point  is  possibly  better
    developed in paragraph 15 where there was a balance that was struck  by
    the judge as to the weight that should be attached to this factor.   He
    accepted in paragraph 15 that the fact that the appellant had taken two
    previous attempts to pass the English  language  test  and  had  failed
    provided him with a very good motive for him to practise deception  but
    he also took into account the appellant's claim that had he been minded
    to cheat he could have done so  before  he  failed  on  the  first  two
    occasions.  It was obvious therefore that it was a factor that  he  was
    taking into account but realised was equivocal.

20. The other matters that he took  into  account  which  are  set  out  in
    subparagraphs (iv), (v) and (vi) may not be  as  significant.   He  had
    attempted to contact the college where the test was taken but he  found
    out that that college had  been  closed.   The  judge  also  took  into
    account that he had been studying since his arrival in 2006 until  2014
    and that there was no adverse immigration history which might found the
    basis of an adverse credibility finding.

21. So, balancing all of those factors into consideration, he concluded  in
    paragraph 15 that the evidence supported  the  probabilities  that  the
    appellant had been able to raise the level of his  proficiency  in  the
    English language and that he was living and speaking  with  a  British-
    born partner and that resulted in paragraph 16 in the judge's  ultimate
    conclusion that the respondent had failed to discharge  the  burden  of
    establishing that this appellant  practised  deception.   That,  in  my
    judgment, was in conformity with the approach that was adopted  by  the
    Tribunal in the case of SM and Qadir and by the Court of Appeal in  the
    case of Qadir v Secretary of State.  It is true that  the  decision  of
    Qadir in the Court of Appeal decided on 25 October 2016 was  not  taken
    into account by the judge but then the hearing took place on 4  October
    2016.  It was therefore a case that actually pre-dated the decision  of
    the Court of Appeal.

22. The Secretary of State makes two significant points in relation to  the
    handling of this claim.  First of all, she relies upon the decision  of
    MA (ETS - TOEIC testing)  Nigeria  [2016]  UKUT  450.   That  case  was
    decided on 14 September 2016 and was not mentioned  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge.  Presumably neither party raised issues in relation  to
    it.  That decision took into account some more evidence that  had  been
    provided recently and the crucial point, I think, to make  in  relation
    to the account is the balance that was struck  between  the  evidential
    burden which the Secretary of State had  discharged  and  the  evidence
    that was provided by the claimant as to his language skills.

23. There were provided in the  course  of  the  decision  a  catalogue  of
    discrete findings in relation to the appellant's evidence.  There  were
    gaps in the evidence.   He  failed  to  provide  even  the  most  basic
    description of his journey to  the  relevant  college.   He  sought  to
    distance himself from contemporaneous records  apparently  relating  to
    taking  a  test  at  Queensway  College.   He  failed  to  provide  any
    photograph of the first of the two TOEIC certificates.  There were self-
    evident gaps and discrepancies which the appellant gave to  the  border
    force at Heathrow Airport.  It was accepted by the  Tribunal  that  the
    appellant  probably  found  himself  in  a  stressful  situation   when
    questioned by the border force but it noted that  he  was  given  every
    incentive and opportunity to provide a candid and full  explanation  in
    respect of the two TOEIC certificates, which he failed to do.

24. The conclusion of  the  Tribunal's  consideration  of  the  appellant's
    evidence was that, whilst there was cogent evidence in  the  appeal  in
    relation to the Secretary of State's claim, this  was  to  be  compared
    with the poor evidence of the appellant himself.  It  was  therefore  a
    conclusion that the Tribunal properly made that the  evidential  burden
    had been satisfied at the initial stage by the Secretary of State.  The
    appellant had failed to discharge the evidential burden of providing an
    innocent explanation with the effect that the Secretary of  State  also
    discharged the legal burden.  It was a fact-finding and  fact-sensitive
    decision that was made.

25. I am also referred to a decision in the Administrative Court.  That  of
    course is not  a  decision  made  as  a  result  of  any  fact-finding.
    Inevitably it was a decision where there has  been  no  oral  evidence.
    This was a decision of Garnham J in the  Administrative  Court  in  the
    case of R on the application of Veronica Gaogalalwe [2017]  EWHC  1709.
    In that case the evidence that was submitted included the  evidence  of
    Professor French.  It was considered by the High Court Judge.   In  the
    course of the assessment it was concluded that there was  strengthening
    evidence in relation to the weight that could be attached  to  the  ETS
    trained listeners to help reduce the  number  of  false  positives  and
    Professor French had concluded that these were very substantially  less
    than 1% after the process by trained listeners had been applied.

26. The evidence, however, on the part of the  claimant  in  the  case  was
    quite obviously very weak indeed.  Her case, as recorded by Garnham  J,
    was that she had no reason to use a  fraudulent  test  provider.   That
    was, apparently, almost the sum total of  her  evidence.   Accordingly,
    once again, on the basis of the weight that could be  attached  to  her
    evidence, even taken at its  highest,  as  it  would  have  been  in  a
    judicial review hearing, it simply fell well short of  discharging  the
    evidential burden that the Secretary of State had set up in the generic
    evidence.

27. None of these cases, in my judgment, alter the weight  that  the  judge
    was entitled to attach to the evidence of the appellant.

28. Whilst the evidence of Professor French was before  the  judge,  it  is
    difficult to know what to make of this in terms of how a judicial fact-
    finder is to assess the evidence of an appellant who provides evidence.
     Clearly matters have progressed but it nevertheless remains  the  case
    that there is a decision that has to be made by the judicial  decision-
    maker as to whether the explanation provided by the  appellant  was  an
    innocent one.  This inevitably means that the judge has to form a  view
    as to the overall credibility of the appellant on the evidence that was
    provided.

29. In these circumstances I am satisfied that the judge  was  entitled  to
    rely upon his findings that were made in paragraphs 14  and  15.   They
    are not tainted by his failure to refer to any other or subsequent case-
    law or, indeed, the evidence of Professor French, which  is  of  course
    directed towards the probabilities of there being  false  positives  in
    the assessment by ETS.  There can still apparently be  false  positives
    and it was for the judge to determine whether the explanation  provided
    by the appellant was sufficient  to  prevent  the  Secretary  of  State
    establishing that she had established the legal burden.  Consequently I
    do not consider there was an error of law in the judge's determination.

DECISION

   1. The appeal of the Secretary of State against the decision of the First-
      tier Tribunal Judge is dismissed.
   2. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge shall stand.
   3. No anonymity direction is made.
