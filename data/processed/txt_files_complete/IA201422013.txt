                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   On 9th May 2013 Mr Hamza's application to vary his leave as  a  Tier  4
    Migrant was refused, with a concomitant decision to  remove  him  under
    section 47 of the Immigration, Asylum and  Nationality  Act  2006.   No
    points had been awarded  under  Appendix  A  for  English  language  or
    Appendix C for Maintenance funds.  Although Mr  Hamza  had  passed  all
    four components of an English language  test  taken  with  an  approved
    provider, he had not achieved level B2 in Speaking and Writing  at  the
    same time.  He had  fallen  short  of  the  requisite  160  points  for
    Speaking when he took the test on  21st  March  2012,  but  scored  190
    points when he re-sat the Speaking Test on 19th June.  He  had  already
    passed the Listening and Reading components  on  26th  March,  but  his
    TOEIC certificate for Speaking was said not to be  acceptable,  because
    the Listening component had to appear on the same certificate.  As  for
    maintenance, the bank statement which Mr Gulzar had sent in covered the
    period 12th February to 4th March 2013, whereas it needed to  run  from
    5th February in order to cover the requisite period of 28 days.

2.   An appeal to the First-tier Tribunal came before Judge  Hands  on  11th
    October 2013 for determination 'on the papers', and was dismissed under
    the Immigration Rules, because the decisions in respect  of  Attributes
    and Maintenance were said to be lawful.  But  the  appeal  was  allowed
    under Article 8, because Judge Hands thought that the appellant  should
    be allowed to complete his course, which was due to end in August 2014.
     Permission to challenge that outcome was granted by  Designated  Judge
    Coates, and so the matter came before me today.

3.    The  appellant  himself  did  not  attend   the   hearing,   and   was
    unrepresented.  Notice of the hearing had been sent to his  address  in
    Hounslow, and had not been returned undelivered,  so  I  was  satisfied
    that notice had been duly served  and  that  I  could  proceed  in  his
    absence.  Miss Everett appeared for the Secretary of State.

4.   It seemed to me that the challenge by the Secretary  of  State  to  the
    First-tier decision to allow the appeal on Article 8 grounds had merit,
    in that Judge Hands did not sufficiently  explain  how  Mr  Gulzar  had
    established a human right to complete  his  course,  when  he  did  not
    satisfy the immigration rules for leave to remain as a  student.   That
    want of proper reasons constituted  a  material  error,  requiring  the
    decision on the appeal to be re-made by the Upper Tribunal.

5.   Contrary to the finding of the First-tier Tribunal,  I  find  that  the
    appeal does fall to be allowed under the Immigration Rules.  As far  as
    English language is concerned, there is no requirement in the Rules for
    the Speaking and Writing components of an English language test  to  be
    taken together and to appear on the  same  certificate.   The  rule  in
    question ~ paragraph 118(b)(ii)(4) of Appendix A ~ says  nothing  about
    that.  It may be mentioned in the Policy Guidance, but if it is not  in
    the Rules, it is not binding.

6.   As for the Maintenance funds, Mr Gulzar  included  a  bank  certificate
    for  the  period  12th  April  to  11th  May  2012  with  his   earlier
    application.   This  showed  a  credit  balance  of  well  over  �2,000
    throughout the requisite 28-day period, when all that  was  needed  was
    �1,600.  When asked to submit a more recent bank statement,  Mr  Gulzar
    sent one in for the period 12th  February  to  4th  March  2013.   This
    showed  a  credit  balance  even  further  above  the  �1,600  required
    throughout the period.  But the period was too short.  It  was  not  28
    days.

7.   This  was  a  situation,  however,  crying  out  for  the  exercise  of
    evidential flexibility, as in paragraph 245AA(b)(i) of Part 6A  of  the
    Rules.  The later bank statement was headed 'Date of previous statement
    11 February 2013'.  That statement included the days missing  from  the
    28-day period, and the statement clearly existed and could  readily  be
    obtained from the  applicant.   Instead  of  refusing  the  application
    because the bank statement  submitted  did  not  cover  a  long  enough
    period, the caseworker should have contacted Mr Gulzar and asked him to
    send in the previous statement, for the  period  ending  11th  February
    2013.  Miss Everett very fairly agreed that this was just the  sort  of
    circumstance which the policy of 'evidential flexibility' was  supposed
    to address.

8.   Failure to apply the rule in accordance with the policy means that  the
    resulting  decision  is  'not  in  accordance  with  the   law'.    The
    application for variation of leave is therefore outstanding before  the
    Secretary of State, and awaits a lawful decision.  No doubt  Mr  Gulzar
    will be  contacted  again  and  asked  to  submit  an  up-to-date  bank
    statement, covering a recent 28-day period, in order for that  decision
    to be made.


     DECISION

     The Secretary of State's appeal  is  allowed,  to  the  extent  that  a
    material  error  of  law  has  been  identified   in   the   First-tier
    determination.  The decision on the original appeal is now  re-made  by
    the Upper Tribunal, and the appeal is allowed  to  the  limited  extent
    that the decision refusing to vary leave is not in accordance with  the
    law.  The matter is remitted to the Secretary of State, for her to make
    a fresh decision on the application to vary leave.
