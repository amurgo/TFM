For the Appellant:     Mr Bahja of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Bramble a Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

      1. The Respondent refused the Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
         enter as the spouse of a United Kingdom citizen on  4  April  2014,
         that application having been made on 9 July 2013.

      2. This was due to him being a  "persistent  offender".  His  offences
         included theft of mail,  obtain  property  by  deception,  using  a
         vehicle while uninsured, failing to surrender to custody, theft  by
         an employee, possession  of  an  offensive  weapon,  theft  from  a
         dwelling, theft from a person, and making off without payment.  The
         offences were committed between 2003 and 2006. He had, in addition,
         used false  identities  and  overstayed  his  visa  remaining  here
         unlawfully for 5 years from 2002 to 2007.

      3. His appeal against that decision, based on the passage of time  and
         the fact of having a young family settled here,  was  dismissed  by
         First-tier Tribunal Judge Howard ("the Judge") following a  hearing
         on 26 March 2015. This is an appeal against that decision.

The grounds of the application

    (1)    Failure to conclude that his child (Megan  born  on  14  January
    2010) was a "qualifying child".

      4. It was argued in the grounds that as her  passport  was  issued  in
         April 2010 she was at the date of  birth  a  British  citizen.  The
         Judge rejected that argument. Permission to appeal on  that  ground
         was refused as there was nothing "before the Judge to show that  at
         the time of her birth her mother" Mrs Ofori-Appiah "had  indefinite
         leave to remain in the United Kingdom".

    (2)    Failure to  consider  Sanade  and  others  (British  children  -
    Zambrano - Dereci) India [2012] UKUT 48 (IAC) and Campbell  (Exclusion;
    Zambrano) Jamaica [2013] UKUT 147 (IAC).

      5. It was argued in the grounds that;

             "The test in Zambrano is  whether  the  EU  citizen  would  be
             forced to leave the Union. The appellant's wife made it  clear
             that she and the children were considering leaving the  UK  in
             order to be with the appellant. This  was  not  a  choice  she
             would have to make herself, but she  felt  she  had  no  other
             option but to leave the UK."

      6. Mr Bahja submitted that if  Megan  was  not  a  "qualifying  child"
         Zambrano and Senade did not apply.

    (3)    Failure to consider the best interests  of  the  children  in  a
    proper context.

      7. It was argued in the grounds that;

             "Even if there were no Qualifying children, the  Judge  had  a
             duty to consider their best interest under section 55  of  the
             2009 Act."

The grant of permission

      8. First-tier Tribunal Judge Grimmett granted permission to appeal  (3
         August 2015), only on the ground that;

             "... Sanade and Zambrano which it appears were raised  in  the
             Appellant's skeleton argument ... have not been considered  by
             the Judge."

Respondent's position

      9. The Respondent asserted in her rule 24 reply (12  August  2015)  in
         essence that it is  difficult  to  see  how  Sanade/Zambrano  would
         assist the Appellant given his offending and the  circumstances  of
         his children.

     10. Mr Bramble submitted that Campbell does not assist the Appellant as
         in that case the children were born prior to the Appellant  leaving
         the United Kingdom and his removal [31 of Campbell] did not;

             "... prevent them from continuing to exercise  in  the  United
             Kingdom  substantive  enjoyments  of  their  rights  as  Union
             citizens."

Discussion

Ground 1 - "qualifying child"

     11. Permission was not granted to enable this to be argued. Even if  it
         had been, or the Judge  erred  and  the  child  was  a  "qualifying
         child", the application would have been dismissed for the  all  the
         reasons that follow regarding ground 2.

Ground 2 - Sanade/Zambrano

     12. Zambrano v Office national de l'emploi (Case C-34/09)  CJEU  (Grand
         Chamber), 8 March 2011 states that a child's  European  citizenship
         is a source of rights for the  child  and  his/her  parents/carers,
         irrespective of any crossing of  borders  and  exercise  of  Treaty
         rights such as those relating to freedom of movement.

     13. Dereci and others v Bundesministerium fï¿½r Inneres  (Case  C-256/11)
         CJEU (Grand Chamber), 15 November 2011, states  that  the  Citizens
         Directive was not applicable to third country nationals who applied
         for the right of residence in order to  join  their  Union  citizen
         family members who had never exercised their right to free movement
         and who had always resided in the Member State of which  they  were
         nationals.

     14. Campbell (exclusion; Zambrano) [2013] UKUT 00147 (IAC) guides me to
         the view that Zambrano principles apply in both in-country and out-
         of-country cases where  the  Member  State  must  ensure  that  any
         "refusal does not lead, for the Union  citizen  concerned,  to  the
         denial of the genuine enjoyment of  the  substance  of  the  rights
         conferred by virtue of his status as a citizen of the Union".

     15. Sanade and others (British children -  Zambrano  -  Dereci)  [2012]
         UKUT 00048 (IAC) guides me to the view, among other things that the
         fact the children are British was a strong pointer to the fact that
         their future lies in the United Kingdom. Zambrano  makes  it  clear
         that where the child or remaining spouse is a British  citizen  and
         therefore a citizen of the European Union, it is  not  possible  to
         require the family as a unit to relocate outside  of  the  European
         Union or for the Secretary of State to  submit  that  it  would  be
         reasonable for them to do so.  The  critical  question  is  whether
         removal of that parent will deprive  the  child  of  the  effective
         exercise of residence in the United Kingdom  or  elsewhere  in  the
         Union. Where the claimant's conduct is  persistent  and/or  serious
         the interference with family life may be justified even it involves
         the separation of the claimant from his family who reasonably  wish
         to continue living in the United Kingdom (c.f. Lee v  Secretary  of
         State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 348).

     16. This application fails on the following grounds.

     17. Firstly, the children are not exercising freedom of movement.  They
         have never lived elsewhere than the United  Kingdom.  The  3  month
         period when the older child saw in Ghana  with  the  Appellant  was
         temporary and only due to a particular  set  of  circumstances  her
         mother found herself in.

     18. Secondly, neither the children nor their mother  are  being  denied
         the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights  conferred  by
         virtue of their status as a citizen of the Union. The  family  life
         that was determined as being the most appropriate when  the  adults
         chose to have a family was  always  subject  to  being  limited  by
         geography and immigration control.

     19. Thirdly, Mrs Ofori-Appiah and the children are not being forced  to
         leave the United Kingdom. The children are plainly not  considering
         anything given their tender years. Considering leaving  the  United
         Kingdom falls far  short  of  being  forced  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom.

     20. Fourthly, the Appellant is a persistent offender as  shown  by  his
         list of previous convictions, and his lack of remorse is  evidenced
         by the lies he told the Respondent and the  Judge  when  he  denied
         having been arrested let alone convicted for the various  offences.
         His dishonesty appears to be a core part of his character. In  this
         regard I note the following evidence.

     21. The Appellant's Solicitor wrote (3 October 2013) with the notice of
         appeal;

             "3. The appellant is shocked to  find  his  previous  offences
             taken into consideration whereas he has  thoroughly  explained
             to the ECO that he has not committed any of these offences.

             4.  The appellant spouse is surprised that the ECO is  judging
             him on his previous offences, which he never committed.

             5.  ... the ECO cannot separate family under article 8."

     22. In the handwritten note  attached  to  the  notice  of  appeal  the
         Appellant said he was "never  arrested"  for  the  theft  of  mail,
         obtaining property be deception, theft by employee, or theft from a
         dwelling, and he was not charged with making off  without  payment.
         He filed a statement (19/08/14) also denied having committed any of
         the identified offences. Mrs Ofori-Appiah filed a similar statement
         (19/08/14).

     23. Mr Bahja submitted that the Appellant had been  in  Ghana  and  had
         made  a  mistake  regarding  his  convictions.  The  scale  of  the
         convictions was not such that the public  interest  would  prevail.
         The Judge looked at it from the wrong direction. The fact that  the
         children are British makes a difference.

     24.  Despite  these  entirely  false  protestations,  and  Mr   Bahja's
         submission, the  Police  Certificate  that  was  issued  for  entry
         clearance purposes (24 July 2013) identifies that the Appellant had
         been sentenced on 2 different dates at  the  Central  Hertfordshire
         Magistrates Court for 5 separate offences. In addition he had  been
         cautioned on 3 different dates by the police  for  4  offences.  Of
         those 9 separate matters, 6 involved  dishonesty.  I  further  note
         that the Appellant used 8 different names and 5 different dates  of
         birth.

     25. In my judgement, despite Mr Bahja's submissions, this Appellant  is
         in a far weaker position than the Appellant in Campbell  (who  lost
         his appeal) for the following reasons.

     26. Firstly in Campbell the Appellant entered into his family life with
         his children whilst that Appellant was in the United Kingdom.  This
         Appellant chose to have children whilst he was outside  the  United
         Kingdom and created a family where the family life that  was  going
         to be enjoyed was defined by the parameters of distance  and  being
         subject to immigration control.

     27. Secondly the Appellant in Campbell pleaded guilty to only 1 offence
         and did not seek to resile from that  conviction  or  use  multiple
         aliases and dates of birth. This  Appellant  committed  9  separate
         offences and had been either cautioned or convicted on  5  separate
         dates and yet sought to mislead the Respondent  and  the  Judge  by
         denying having committed them or even having been arrested which he
         plainly was, and he used 8 different names and 5 different dates of
         birth. This  Appellant  was  therefore  rightly  described  by  the
         Respondent in the refusal letter  as  "a  persistent  offender  who
         shows a particular disregard for  the  law".  The  dishonesty  that
         formed the core of his offending persists to this day as he  sought
         to mislead the Respondent and the  Judge  regarding  his  offending
         behaviour.

     28. For all these reasons, in  my  judgement  there  was  therefore  no
         material error of law in the manner in which the Judge  dealt  with
         the "Sanade/Zambrano" issue.

Ground 3 - best interests of the children

     29. Permission was not  granted  to  enable  this  to  be  argued.  The
         application  was  based  entirely  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the
         applicability of the principles derived from Zambrano to the  facts
         of this case.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision.
