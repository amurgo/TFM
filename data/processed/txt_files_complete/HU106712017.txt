For the Respondent:    Ms. K. Pal, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against  a  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Khawar, promulgated on 3 September  2018,  in  which  he
    dismissed the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's  decision  to
    allow further leave to remain on human rights grounds.

 2. Given the involvement of a child, I have made an anonymity direction.

 3. Permission to appeal was granted as follows:

         "It is arguable that the Judge has not set out a full  analysis  of
         the scope of the available evidence in relation to the question  of
         whether there is a genuine and  subsisting  parental  relationship.
         It is arguable that a fuller analysis was required in  the  context
         of analysing reasonableness in relation  to  the  question  of  the
         child's return.  The Judge noted that there was in fact no evidence
         in relation to the Appellant's  daughter's  status  in  the  United
         Kingdom.  The Judge noted the only documentary  evidence  filed  by
         the Appellant was a letter from her daughter's  school  dated  25th
         June 2018.  Further material in this context is identified  in  the
         permission application.  The Judge refers at paragraph  33  of  the
         decision to the correspondence of 29th September 2017 and 9th  June
         2014.  The Judge found that this correspondence did  not  establish
         or corroborate the Appellant's assertions of regular  contact  with
         her daughter.  It is arguable that findings were  required  in  the
         context of the existence of a parental relationship.  It is further
         arguable that a holistic assessment of the evidence in this context
         including the evidence  of  the  photographs  referred  to  in  the
         permission application  was  required.   It  is  arguable  that  an
         insufficient analysis has been set out in relation to the  question
         of the reasonableness of the child's return.  The  Judge  noted  at
         paragraph 36 that there was in fact no evidence in relation to  the
         Appellant's daughter's status in the United Kingdom.  The child had
         been given leave."

 4. The Appellant attended the hearing.   I  heard  submissions  from  both
    representatives following which I reserved my decision.

Error of Law

 5. The Judge finds at [28]:

         "Having carefully considered all documentary and oral  evidence,  I
         find the Appellant has failed to discharge the burden of proof upon
         her to establish she has any regular  contact  with  her  daughter,
         Janet (aforesaid) who is now said to (sic) 17 years of age and  who
         has lived with the Appellant's "step father" since, allegedly  2004
         (according to the Appellant's oral evidence)."

 6. The Judge then went on to consider the oral evidence of the Appellant's
    daughter spending weekends and holiday periods with the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor.   The  Judge  finds  that  there  is  no  evidence  of   these
    arrangements "other than assertions", and states: "For the reasons  set
    out below I do not find the Appellant and Sponsor credible in  relation
    to such assertions".

 7. At [30] he finds that the Appellant made no mention of  her  daughter's
    existence in her application form.  At [31] he finds that there  is  no
    mention of her daughter in the solicitor's covering letter.   There  is
    no error in these findings.  The application was made on the  basis  of
    the Appellant's relationship with the Sponsor.

 8. At [32] the Judge states:

         "It is evident that the Appellant has only sought to rely upon  her
         daughter's presence in the  United  Kingdom  as  a  result  of  the
         Respondent's RFRL which notes that the Appellant has a child in the
         United Kingdom, whose primary carer is another  individual.   As  a
         result the  Appellant  now  asserts  that  she  sees  her  daughter
         regularly and that her daughter "needs" the Appellant to be settled
         in the United Kingdom."

 9. This is not correct.  The reasons for refusal letter is dated 24 August
    2017.   At  F5  of  the  Respondent's  bundle  is  a  letter  from  the
    Appellant's solicitors to the Respondent.  It states:

         "We write further with reference to your letter of  5th  June  2017
         (copy enclosed) requesting  additional  information  on  our  above
         client's application as a spouse. [....]

    As regards to the second issue relating to her daughter, Miss JOO,  she
    has obtained a letter from her College, Saint Gabriel College,  Langton
    Road,  London,  SW9  6UL  and  it  has  been  enclosed  here  for  your
    attention."

10. At G1 of the Respondent's bundle  is  a  letter  from  the  Appellant's
    daughter's school dated 13 June 2017, which  refers  to  the  Appellant
    attending appointments and parents evenings, and being  listed  as  the
    first contact person for emergencies.

11. I find that the Appellant did  not  seek  to  rely  on  her  daughter's
    presence solely  as  a  result  of  the  reasons  for  refusal  letter.
    Although  the  Appellant's  daughter  was  not  referred  to   in   the
    application form, evidence of her having  entered  the  United  Kingdom
    with  the  Appellant  was  provided  with  the  application.   In   the
    Appellant's passport is a copy of the visa issued to the Appellant  and
    her daughter (B11).   The  Respondent  was  aware  of  the  Appellant's
    daughter from the documents provided with the application if  not  from
    the application form itself.  It was the Respondent  who  made  further
    enquiries regarding the Appellant's daughter, and the letter at G1  was
    provided in response to the Respondent's request.  The Judge  does  not
    refer to this letter in the decision.

12. At [33] the Judge states:

         "The only documentary evidence filed by the Appellant is  a  letter
         from her daughter's school, dated 25th June  2018,  which  declares
         that the Appellant is "listed on our system as mother  and  we  can
         confirm that the [Appellant] has  contact  and  dealings  with  the
         school if needed".   This  clearly  does  not  establish  that  the
         Appellant's daughter  stays  with  the  Appellant  during  weekends
         and/or school holidays.  Similarly,  letter  dated  29th September
         2017   and   9th   June   2014   (pages   45-46   AB),    do    not
         establish/corroborate  the  Appellant's  assertions  that  she  has
         regular contact with her daughter."

13. At [34] the Judge  considers  the  oral  evidence  of  the  Appellant's
    daughter staying with the Appellant and  Sponsor.   At  [35]  he  finds
    "most significantly" that there is no  evidence  from  the  Appellant's
    daughter or the Appellant's stepfather.  At [36] he finds:

         "Therefore, on the totality of the above evidence/considerations  I
         am not satisfied that the Appellant has established that she  meets
         the criteria under Appendix FM EX.1 in relation  to  her  daughter.
         In this regard I note that there is in fact no evidence in relation
         to the Appellant's daughter's status in the United  Kingdom,  other
         than the particulars provided with  the  Respondent's  RFLR  (sic).
         Therefore,  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence  before   me   the
         Appellant's appeal also fails under the parent route under Appendix
         FM".

14. Although the Judge refers to consideration of the parent route [36], as
    the Appellant was eligible to apply under the partner route,  this  was
    the relevant route to be considered under the rules.   The  Appellant's
    daughter was relevant  under  the  partner  route,  with  reference  to
    paragraph EX.1(a).  Under paragraph EX.1(a), the Appellant had to  show
    that she had a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with  her
    daughter.  Although  the  Judge  states  that  he  has  considered  the
    totality of the evidence, I find that he has  failed  to  consider  the
    evidence in the round.  He has focused  on  the  Appellant's  assertion
    that she spends weekends and holiday periods with her daughter and,  in
    focusing on this, has failed properly to consider  the  evidence  which
    was before him.  While the letters from the school do  not  corroborate
    the evidence that the Appellant's daughter stays with the Appellant  at
    weekends, the Judge has failed properly to consider what these  letters
    do show.

15. The issue was whether  the  Appellant  had  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with her daughter, and  I  find  that  the  Judge
    failed properly to consider the evidence before him which went to  this
    issue.  He  drew  an  adverse  inference  from  his  finding  that  the
    Appellant only relied on her daughter's presence after her  application
    had been refused, which was not the case.  It is clear from evidence in
    the Respondent's bundle that there had  been  correspondence  regarding
    the Appellant's daughter prior to the Respondent's decision.

16. I accept  that  there  was  no  evidence  before  the  Judge  from  the
    Appellant's daughter, but this does not detract  from  the  failure  to
    consider the evidence which was provided.  The letters from the school,
    both prior to and after  the  decision,  show  that  the  Appellant  is
    involved in her daughter's education.  The letter at page 45  indicates
    that it is the Appellant's mother who had made an application  for  her
    daughter to have free school meals.  There is a further letter at  page
    46 from the school addressed to the Appellant and to Mr. Osho regarding
    her daughter's progress.  The school  stated  that  the  Appellant  was
    listed as the primary emergency contact  for  her  daughter.   Ms.  Pal
    submitted that this was only for the school's administration  purposes,
    as they had to have a primary contact for the Appellant's daughter, but
    I do not find it to be so limited.  The correspondence also shows  that
    there is a genuine engagement by  the  Appellant  with  her  daughter's
    education.

17. The Judge also failed to consider the  photographic  evidence  provided
    which showed the Appellant together with her  daughter.   There  is  no
    consideration of these photographs.

18. I find that the Judge failed properly to consider  the  evidence  which
    was before him of the relationship of the Appellant and  her  daughter.
    The fact that the  Appellant's  daughter  lives  with  the  Appellant's
    "father" does not rule out a genuine  parental  relationship  with  the
    Appellant.

19. The Judge states  that  there  is  no  evidence  that  the  Appellant's
    daughter  has  any  status  in  the  United  Kingdom,  other  than  the
    particulars provided with the reasons for refusal letter.  The  reasons
    for refusal letter states that the Appellant's daughter  had  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom until November 2017.   It  also  indicated
    that the Appellant's daughter had been  in  the  United  Kingdom  since
    2004.  Therefore she was a  "qualifying  child"  for  the  purposes  of
    paragraph EX.1(a)/ section 117B(6).

20. Taking all of the above into account, I find that the Judge has  failed
    to consider the totality of the evidence and  has  failed  to  consider
    properly whether this evidence showed that the Appellant had a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with her daughter.

Remaking

21. As agreed at the hearing, I remake the decision on  the  basis  of  the
    evidence which was before the First-tier  Tribunal,  and  I  admit  the
    evidence provided for the appeal before me, an application having  been
    made under rule 15(2)(a).  I  have  taken  into  account  the  evidence
    contained  in  the  Appellant's  bundle  provided  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (50 pages), the Appellant's supplementary bundle  (38  pages),
    and the Respondent's bundle (to L17).

22. As set out above, the Respondent considered the Appellant's application
    under the partner route, not the parent route,  as  the  Appellant  was
    eligible to apply as a partner.  I adopt the finding made in the First-
    tier Tribunal that  the  Appellant  is  in  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    relationship with the Sponsor, which the  Respondent  did  not  accept.
    There was no cross-appeal against this finding.  I therefore find  that
    I can proceed to consider whether paragraph EX.1(a) applies.

23. The Appellant's daughter was born on 15 April 2001 and, as at the date
    of the hearing before me, is 17 years old.  She  has  been  here  since
    2004.  I find that she has a residence permit  with  leave  to  remain
    until 17 October 2020.  She previously had  a  residence  permit  valid
    until 13 November 2017.  I therefore find that she is under 18,  is  in
    the UK, and has lived in the UK continuously for  at  least  the  seven
    years immediately preceding the date of application.  I have considered
    whether the evidence  shows  that  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with her daughter.

24. The Appellant's daughter has provided a letter (pages 17 and 18 of  the
    supplementary bundle).  She states that she has a "great  relationship"
    and "excellent communication" with her mother.  She  states  that  they
    are able to "discuss anything" and are able to "laugh  and  be  silly".
    She states that the Appellant gives her motherly advice.

25. The Appellant has provided a further letter from her daughter's  school
    which confirms that the Appellant is listed as  her  daughter's  mother
    and has contact with the school (page 19 of the supplementary  bundle).
    Letters on pages 14 and 20 from the school are addressed  both  to  Mr.
    Osho and to the Appellant.  These relate  to  setting  up  a  ParentPay
    account for the Appellant's daughter, and to the school prom.   I  have
    referred above to the evidence which was before the First-tier Tribunal
    from the Appellant's daughter's school, and I find that this is further
    evidence of the Appellant's involvement with her daughter's education.

26. The Appellant has provided further photographs of her with her daughter
    (pages 34 to 38 of the supplementary bundle).

27. The Appellant states in her witness statement that she arrived  in  the
    United Kingdom with her daughter [14].  Her  daughter  lives  with  the
    Appellant's "father", Mr.  Osho,  but  stays  with  the  Appellant  and
    Sponsor at the weekend and during school holidays  [15].   At  weekends
    they attend the same church [16].   The Appellant's evidence  regarding
    her daughter staying with her was not found credible in the  First-tier
    Tribunal owing to the lack of accommodation.

28. However, I find that even if the Appellant's  daughter  does  not  stay
    with her  every  weekend  and  during  school  holidays,  this  is  not
    necessary to show a genuine and subsisting parental relationship.   The
    evidence before me from the Appellant's daughter and  from  her  school
    shows that the Appellant has regular  and  frequent  contact  with  her
    daughter, and is involved with her daughter's upbringing and education.



29. I do not adopt  the  findings  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  the
    Appellant has no meaningful contact with her daughter.  The letter from
    her daughter indicates that their contact is meaningful, and that  they
    have a genuine mother/daughter relationship.

30. I have considered the case  of  SR  (subsisting  parental  relationship
    -section 117B(6)) Pakistan  [2018]  UKUT  334  (IAC)  provided  by  the
    Appellant's representative  in  relation  to  the  establishment  of  a
    parental relationship.  This concerns  situations  where  a  parent  is
    unable to demonstrate that he or she has been taking an active role  in
    a child's upbringing.  However, I find in this case that the  Appellant
    has shown that she has been taking an active  role  in  her  daughter's
    upbringing, otherwise she would not have any contact with  the  school,
    and the school would not be aware of her existence.  I  find  that  the
    Appellant plays an active role in her child's upbringing.

31. I find that the Appellant brought her daughter to the  United  Kingdom.
    The fact that she is not living with her now does not diminish the fact
    that they still have an ongoing parental relationship.  Her daughter is
    still a child and is not living an independent life.  She  has  contact
    with the Appellant on a regular basis.  The Appellant has not abdicated
    her role as a mother, as can be seen from  the  evidence  provided.   I
    find that the evidence shows that  the  Appellant  has  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with her daughter.

32. I have therefore considered whether it  is  reasonable  to  expect  the
    Appellant's daughter to leave the UK,  taking  into  account  her  best
    interests.  I find that she has been in the United Kingdom since  2004.
    She was three years old when she arrived.  She is now 17.  She has been
    here for 14 years.  She is in her final year at school studying for her
    A levels.  She has received all of her education in the United Kingdom.
     She  is  now  approaching  a  crucial  stage  of  her  education,  the
    culmination of 14 years' study.  She has leave to remain in the  United
    Kingdom.

33. In these circumstances, I find that it would not be in the  Appellant's
    daughter's best interests to leave the United Kingdom  given  her  age,
    the amount of time she has been in the United  Kingdom  and  the  stage
    which her education has reached.  I further find that it would  not  be
    reasonable for her to leave the United Kingdom, given  that  she  would
    have to abandon her education at a  crucial  point,  and  return  to  a
    country where she has not  been  for  14  years.   She  has  spent  her
    formative childhood years in the United Kingdom, and has permission  to
    be here.

34. I therefore find that the Appellant has shown  that  paragraph  EX.1(a)
    applies as it is not reasonable to expect her daughter, with  whom  she
    has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship, to leave the United
    Kingdom.  I therefore find that  she  meets  the  requirements  of  the
    immigration rules.

Article 8

35. I have considered the Appellant's appeal under Article 8 in  accordance
    with the case of Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I find that the Appellant  has
    a family life with her daughter sufficient to engage the  operation  of
    Article 8.  I find  that  she  has  a  relationship  with  the  Sponsor
    sufficient to engage the operation of Article 8.  She has been  in  the
    United Kingdom now for some 14 years and I find that she has a  private
    life sufficient to engage the operation of Article 8.  I find that  the
    decision would interfere with her family and private life.

36. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
    interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
    immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
    rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
    balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
    community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
    orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
    Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
    very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
    the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
    interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
    of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
    proportionate.

37. I have taken into account all of my findings above.  In  assessing  the
    public  interest  I  have  taken  into  account  section  19   of   the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  Section 117B(1) provides
    that the maintenance of effective immigration controls is in the public
    interest.  I have found above that the Appellant meets the requirements
    of paragraph EX.1(a) of the immigration rules.  I therefore  find  that
    there will be no compromise to the maintenance of effective immigration
    control by allowing her appeal.

38. I find that the Appellant speaks English  (section  117B(2)).   In  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal, it was found  that  the  Sponsor's
    income for the previous  year  was  �17,904,  below  that  required  to
    sponsor a spouse under the immigration rules (117B(3)).  The Sponsor is
    still employed, and the evidence provided in the  supplementary  bundle
    shows that he earned �17,952.46 in the tax year ending March 2018 (page
    24).  While I accept that this is below the financial threshold, it  is
    not far below.  There is no evidence that the Appellant is  in  receipt
    of any benefits.

39. Little weight is to be given to a private life established either  when
    leave was precarious, or when an appellant was in  the  United  Kingdom
    unlawfully (sections 117B(4) and (5)).  However, these sections do  not
    apply to family life.

40. Section 117B(6) provides that the public interest does not require  the
    person's removal where "(a) the person has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
    parental relationship with a qualifying child and (b) it would  not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to  leave  the  United  Kingdom".   This
    reflects the position as set out in paragraph EX.1(a).   I  have  found
    above that the Appellant meets the requirements of  paragraph  EX.1(a).
    The Appellant's daughter is a qualifying child, and for the reasons set
    out above, I therefore find that section 117B(6) applies.   The  public
    interest does not require the Appellant's removal.

Decision

41. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
    material error of law and I set the decision aside.

42. I remake the decision allowing the Appellant's appeal on  human  rights
    grounds.  The Appellant meets the requirements of Appendix FM.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award.  Further  evidence  was  provided  for
the appeal.  In the circumstances I make no fee award.
