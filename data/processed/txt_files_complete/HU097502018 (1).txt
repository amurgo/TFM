                      ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND REASONS

The Respondent

 1. The Respondent (the Applicant) is a Pakistani born on 16 December 1983.
    On 27 January 2008 he entered with leave as a student. In 2011 his wife
    entered with leave as his dependant. They have  two  children  born  in
    2013 and 2016.

 2. He obtained a series of further leaves to  remain  within  the  Points-
    Based Scheme, the last of which expired on 06 June 2016. On 31 May 2016
    he applied for indefinite leave to remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant
    which application on 22 September 2017 he varied to an application  for
    indefinite leave on the basis of 10 years' lawful residence.



The SSHD's decision

 3. On 12 April 2018, the Appellant  (the  SSHD)  refused  the  Applicant's
    application  by  reference  to  paragraphs  322(5)  and  276B  of   the
    Immigration Rules because the Respondent considered the  Appellant  had
    been deceitful or dishonest in his dealings with HM Revenue  &  Customs
    (HMRC) or UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) or both.

 4. The Respondent came to this conclusion because for the  year  ending  5
    April 2011 the Applicant had submitted a tax  return  showing  a  total
    income of �18,443.50 which was significantly lower than the earnings of
    �37,877.71 claimed in his application of 5 April 2011 for further leave
    under the Points-Based System.  Similarly,  in  relation  to  the  year
    ending 5 April 2013,  he  had  declared  to  HMRC  a  total  income  of
    �21,271.44 and for a similar period to UKVI an income of �36,994.79.

Proceedings in the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The Applicant appealed and by a decision  promulgated  on  15  November
    2018 Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Stedman  accepted  the  reasons
    given by the Applicant for the need to have amended his 2011  and  2013
    tax returns  because  his  employer  had  supplied  him  with  payslips
    evidencing deductions for income tax but had failed to pass the details
    to HMRC. The Applicant had not been aware of this  until  he  had  been
    preparing the application to  the  SSHD  leading  to  this  appeal.  He
    concluded the Applicant had not been deceitful or dishonest and allowed
    the appeal.

 6. The SSHD sought permission to appeal on the basis the Judge  had  erred
    in law. On  27  December  2018  a  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  refused
    permission noting the permission application had failed to  make  clear
    on what footing the Applicant's actions or omissions had caused him not
    to meet the relevant Immigration Rules. Further,  the  Judge  had  been
    entitled to reach his conclusions

The Upper Tribunal Proceedings

7.   The SSHD renewed its permission application to the Upper  Tribunal.  On
    6 February 2019 Deputy Judge  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  Mailer  granted
    permission because it was arguable that the Judge had erred in  finding
    the Appellant had met his obligations to HMRC when he had not paid  any
    income tax from the relevant employment  and  in  concluding  paragraph
    322(5) of the Immigration Rules was not applicable. He referred to  the
    judgment in R (Khan) v SSHD [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC).

8.   The Applicant attended with his instructing solicitor. I explained  the
    purpose and procedure to be adopted at an Error of Law hearing and  the
    Applicant took no  active  part  in  the  hearing.  No  Response  under
    Procedure Rules 24 had been filed  for  the  Applicant  and  Mr  Sharma
    confirmed there was  no  application  for  submission  of  any  further
    evidence.





Submissions for the SSHD

9.   Mr Tarlow relied on the grounds for appeal. The Applicant  had  claimed
    the errors in his tax returns were not his fault. He  referred  to  the
    accountant's letter identified at item 9 of the Applicant's solicitors'
    letter of 22 September 2017 varying his application for further  leave.
    Both parties confirmed there was no copy of the letter in  their  files
    and there was none in the Tribunal file.

10.  Mr Tarlow continued that the Judge had erred at paragraphs  16  and  17
    of his decision and in finding that the provisions of paragraph  322(5)
    were not applicable. There had been a significant error in  the  income
    figures which the Applicant had reported to  HMRC.  The  Applicant  was
    responsible for accurately reporting his income and had  failed  so  to
    do. The Judge had erred in concluding  that  paragraph  322(5)  had  no
    application in this case.

Submissions for the Applicant

11.  Mr Sharma submitted the accountant's letter previously referred to was
    not material because  the  Judge  had  found  the  Applicant  had  been
    dishonest with neither HMRC nor the SSHD.

12.  The Judge had dealt with the  applicability  of  paragraph  322(5)  at
    paragraphs 18ff of his decision although the SSHD had failed to make  a
    case for considering the Applicant to have been  dishonest.  Dishonesty
    was a necessary condition to engage  paragraph  322(5).  The  Applicant
    accepted his returns to HMRC had been inaccurate. The income tax due on
    the Applicant's earnings from employment subject to the Pay As You Earn
    scheme was deductible by the employer who was under a duty  to  account
    for it to HMRC. The Applicant's payslips and bank  statements  tallied.
    With good reason the Applicant had believed  and  had  always  believed
    that he had met his tax liabilities as evidenced in  the  documentation
    supplied to him by his employer. There was no reason for  him  to  make
    enquiries whether his employer had passed on to HMRC the  tax  deducted
    from his earnings.

13.  The Judge had considered  that  the  unreported  decision  in  Sandeep
    Kadian  (HU/11723/2016)  had  no  application  to  the  facts  of   the
    Applicant's case and separately had  concluded  that  paragraph  322(5)
    also had no application.

14.  Mr Tarlow had no further submissions to make beyond referring  to  the
    misrepresentation of the Applicant's income identified on page 3 of the
    reasons for refusal of 12 April 2018.

Consideration

15.  The  Applicant  accepted  the  discrepancies  identified  by  the  SSHD
      between his returns to HMRC and his applications to the SSHD. His case
      in brief is that the discrepancies relate to his earned income subject
      to PAYE. His  employer  had  supplied  him  with  payslips  evidencing
      deduction of tax. His  bank  statements  showed  receipt  of  the  net
      earnings disclosed by the payslips. His employer had failed to account
      to HMRC for the deductions for tax the  employer  had  made  from  the
      Applicant's earnings.

16.  The Judge erred in stating that the Applicant  had  met  his  full  tax
      liabilities rather than simply stating the Applicant had every  reason
      to believe he  had  met  his  liabilities  because  his  employer  had
      deducted under  the  PAYE  scheme  sufficient  from  his  earnings  to
      discharge his liabilities. He also erred in failing to take account of
      the learning in R (Khan).  For  these  reasons  I  find  the  decision
      contained a material error of law. There was no challenge before me to
      the core facts found by the First-tier Tribunal save as  mentioned  in
      the first sentence of this paragraph which refers more to construction
      than to fact-finding. In the circumstances, I find it  appropriate  to
      deal with the substantive appeal.

17.  The Applicant's mis-representations to HMRC amounted to  a  failing  to
      declare earned income for which he believed all tax had been  deducted
      by his employer and accounted to HMRC. The Judge had referred  to  the
      accountant's letter at paragraph 15 of his decision and  at  paragraph
      14 noted the Applicant stated he had made enquiries  of  his  employer
      but without success. The  Judge  accepted  the  explanation  from  the
      accountant: it is unfortunate that the letter no longer appears to  be
      in the Tribunal file. There was no claim by the SSHD that it  had  not
      been included with the Applicant's original application as  listed  as
      item 9 of his covering letter of 22 September 2017.

18.  The statement of Mr Lewis  of  HMRC  at  item  C  of  the  Respondent's
      bundle records the Applicant's PAYE earnings and  the  amount  of  tax
      deducted. The SSHD had this information from HMRC and had sight of the
      Applicant's payslips. There is no indication in the Tribunal file that
      the SSHD had made further enquiries  about  the  tax  records  of  the
      employers who had operated the PAYE schemes from which deductions  had
      been made for tax from the Applicant's earnings.  The  combination  of
      the payslips and bank statements submitted by the Applicant is  in  my
      view sufficient to explain the discrepancies identified by  the  SSHD.
      The SSHD has powers under s.40 UK Borders Act 2007 to  obtain  further
      information from HMRC about the operation of the PAYE  scheme  by  the
      Applicant's employers to which information the Applicant  may  not  be
      entitled. Whether the SSHD suggests or requests  HMRC  to  investigate
      the manner in which the Applicant's employers have operated  the  PAYE
      scheme in relation to the Applicant is not for me  to  say.  The  SSHD
      made no suggestion and submitted no evidence to indicate the Applicant
      might have been complicit or connived with his employer.

19.  The Judge erred in stating that the Applicant  had  met  his  full  tax
      liabilities rather than simply stating the Applicant had every  reason
      to believe he  had  met  his  liabilities  because  his  employer  had
      deducted under  the  PAYE  scheme  sufficient  from  his  earnings  to
      discharge his liabilities. He also erred in failing to take account of
      the learning in R (Khan).  For  these  reasons  I  find  the  decision
      contained a material error of law. There was no challenge before me to
      the basic facts found by the First-tier Tribunal save as mentioned  in
      the first sentence of this paragraph which refers more to construction
      than to fact-finding. In the circumstances, I find it  appropriate  to
      deal with the substantive appeal.

20.  I refer to the guidance given at paragraph 37 of R (Khan):

     (i) Where there has been a significant difference  between  the  income
         claimed in a previous application  for  leave  to  remain  and  the
         income declared to HMRC, the Secretary of State is entitled to draw
         an inference that the Applicant has been deceitful or dishonest and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.  I would expect the Secretary of State  to  draw
         that inference where there is  no  plausible  explanation  for  the
         discrepancy.

     (ii) However, where an Applicant has presented evidence to  show  that,
         despite the prima facie inference, he was not in fact dishonest but
         only careless, then the Secretary of State is presented with a fact-
         finding task: she must decide whether the explanation and  evidence
         is sufficient, in her view, to displace the prima  facie  inference
         of deceit/dishonesty.

     (iii) In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of  State
         should remind herself that, although the standard of proof  is  the
         "balance  of  probability",  a  finding  that  a  person  has  been
         deceitful and dishonest in relation to his  tax  affairs  with  the
         consequence that he is denied settlement in this country is a  very
         serious finding with serious consequences.

         (iv)  However,  for  an  applicant  simply  to  blame  his  or  her
         accountant for an "error" in relation to the historical tax  return
         will not be the  end  of  the  matter:  far  from  it.   Thus,  the
         Secretary of State is entitled to  take  into  account  that,  even
         where an accountant has made  an  error,  the  accountant  will  or
         should have asked the tax payer to  confirm  that  the  return  was
         accurate and to have signed the tax  return,  and  furthermore  the
         Applicant will have known of his or  her  earnings  and  will  have
         expected to pay tax  thereon.   If,  realising  this  (or  wilfully
         shutting his eyes to the situation), the Applicant  has  not  taken
         steps within  a  reasonable  time  to  remedy  the  situation,  the
         Secretary of State may be entitled  to  conclude  either  that  the
         error was not simply the fault of the accountant or, alternatively,
         the Applicant's failure to remedy the situation itself justifies  a
         conclusion that he has been has been  deceitful  or  dishonest  and
         therefore he should be refused ILR within paragraph 322(5)  of  the
         Immigration Rules.

         (v) Where an issue arises as to whether an error in relation  to  a
         tax return has been dishonest or merely careless, the Secretary  of
         State  is  obliged  to  consider  the  evidence  pointing  in  each
         direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion by reference
         to that evidence. In those circumstances, as long as the  reasoning
         is rational and the evidence  has  been  properly  considered,  the
         decision of the Secretary of State cannot be impugned.

         (vi) There will be legitimate questions for the Secretary of  State
         to consider in reaching her decision in these cases, including (but
         these are by no means exclusive):

             i. Whether the explanation for the error by the  accountant  is
                plausible;

            ii. Whether the documentation which can be assumed to exist (for
                example,  correspondence  between  the  Applicant  and   his
                accountant at the time of the tax return) has been disclosed
                or there is a plausible explanation for why it is missing;

           iii. Why the Applicant did not realise that  an  error  had  been
                made because his liability to  pay  tax  was  less  than  he
                should have expected;

            iv. Whether, at any stage, the  Applicant  has  taken  steps  to
                remedy the situation and, if so, when those steps were taken
                and the explanation for any significant delay.

         (vii)    In relation to any of the above matters, the Secretary  of
         State is likely to want to see  evidence  which  goes  beyond  mere
         assertion:  for example, in a case such as the  present  where  the
         explanation is that the Applicant was distracted by his concern for
         his son's health, there should be documentary  evidence  about  the
         matter.  If there is, then the Secretary of  State  would  need  to
         weigh up whether such concern genuinely  excuses  or  explains  the
         failure to account for tax, or at  least  displaces  the  inference
         that the Applicant has been deceitful/dishonest. The  Secretary  of
         State, before making her decision, should  call  for  the  evidence
         which she considers ought to exist, and may  draw  an  unfavourable
         inference from any failure on the part of the Applicant to  produce
         it.

         (viii) In her decision, the Secretary of  State  should  articulate
         her reasoning, setting out the matters which  she  has  taken  into
         account in reaching her decision and stating the  reasons  for  the
         decision she has reached.

21.   The  Judge  gave  sustainable  reasons  for  finding  the  Applicant's
      explanation of the discrepancies in income declared  to  HMRC  and  to
      UKVI. The SSHD has obtained the statement of Mr Lewis of HMRC but this
      statement on its own does  not  give  any  factual  information  which
      supports or  disproves  the  Applicant's  plausible  explanation.  The
      Applicant's explanation is plausible and credible in the light of  the
      production of bank statements showing  receipt  of  the  net  earnings
      disclosed in the Applicant's payslips.

22.  The Applicant has accepted he failed to disclose  in  his  tax  returns
      income received from employment where he had every reason  to  believe
      that tax had been deducted for onward  transmission  to  HMRC  by  his
      employer. I am satisfied the Applicant's omission of  a  reference  in
      the tax  returns  to  PAYE  employment  falls  into  the  category  of
      carelessness and not dishonesty. The Applicant  had  every  reason  to
      believe that tax on those earnings,  having  been  deducted  from  his
      earnings, had been declared and paid to HMRC by his employer.

23.  For these reasons, I do not find the SSHD has shown there  are  grounds
      to engage paragraph 322(5)  and  in  the  alternative,  if  there  are
      grounds, then applying the jurisprudence in R (Khan) the Applicant has
      displaced the inference of deceitful or dishonest behaviour and it  is
      disproportionate to refuse his claim for  indefinite  leave  based  on
      long residence because of the omissions from two of his tax returns of
      mention of his income from PAYE employment in respect of which he  had
      every reason to believe his employer had declared and paid to HMRC all
      tax due on his income from that employment. On the  figures  disclosed
      to the Tribunal there would have been no liability to pay any  further
      income tax at basic or higher rate levels. The appeal is allowed.

Anonymity

24.  There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  considered
    the appeal I find none is warranted.

SUMMARY OF DECISION

    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of law and to
    the limited extent referred to is set aside.
    The appeal of the Applicant is allowed.
    Anonymity direction not made.
