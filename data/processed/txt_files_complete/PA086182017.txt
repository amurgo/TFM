                            DECISION AND REASONS

1     This is an appeal brought  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
      decision of Judge of the  First  tier  Tribunal  O  R  Williams  dated
      20.10.17 allowing the applicant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
      State's decision of 1.8.17 to refuse the applicant's protection claim.
      I shall retain the designations of the parties as they were before the
      First tier.

2     The Appellant is of Kurdish ethnicity, and was born in Kifri,  in  the
      Diyala governorate in  Cental  and  Southern  Iraq.  He  attended  the
      University of Salahaddin, Erbil (i.e.  in  the  Iraqi  Kurdish  Region
      ('IKR') comprising Dohuk, Erbil and Suleimaniah) for  4  years  ending
      June 2016, studying history. He would go home  regularly  during  that
      period (SEF q 11-14).

3     The Appellant claimed  to  be  in  need  of  international  protection
      because of a fear of serious harm said to have arisen  in  Kifri  from
      the family of a young woman, SM, with whom the Appellant had formed  a
      relationship outside of marriage. SM was also from Kifri but they  had
      met and formed a relationship at the  university  in  Erbil,  and  had
      graduated together. They had a sexual relationship. The Appellant  had
      told SM that he would offer to marry her.

4     The Appellant claimed that in September 2016 and December 2016 he  had
      asked SM's family to allow then to marry,  but  they  had  refused  on
      grounds that the Appellant was an atheist. They also learned that  the
      Appellant had had a sexual relationship with SM. They beat SM and kept
      her imprisoned and threatened to harm  the  Appellant.  The  Appellant
      left Kifri, travelling firstly to Erbil. He perceived that he  was  at
      risk there, and later spent some time in Dohuk, before leaving Iraq in
      January 2016 and travelling to the UK via Turkey and other  countries,
      arriving in the UK on 9.3.17.

5      In  her  decision  of  21.8.17,  the  Respondent  accepted  that  the
      Appellant had had a relationship  with  SM,  but  rejected  that  SM's
      family sought to harm  him  as  a  result.  In  the  alternative,  the
      Respondent argued that the Appellant could internally relocate to  the
      IKR, being able to be  admitted  for  10  days  and  to  register  for
      renewal, and noting that the Appellant had  resided  in  Erbil  for  4
      years whilst at university (para 45). He would be able to pass through
      Baghdad,  as  necessary  (para  46).  It  is  to  be  seen  that   the
      Respondent's case was not that the Appellant originated from the  IKR,
      but that he could be admitted there as a Kurd.

6     The Appellant's appeal came before the Judge on  4.10.17.   The  Judge
      accepted the credibility of  the  core  of  the  Appellant's  account,
      finding that the Appellant was of specific ongoing adverse interest to
      SM's family for a perceived honour crime as they have  threatened  him
      with death [34].

7     The Judge purported to find that the Appellant was 'from  Dohuk'  [21]
      (which is in the IKR) and that he was 'from' the IKR  [33].  I  cannot
      see the evidential foundation for this - his evidence was that he  was
      from Kifri, in the Diyala governorate. It may make little  difference,
      as the Judge appeared to proceed on the basis that the Appellant could
      enter, reside, and seek employment in IKR (see e.g. [41]).

8     The Judge rejected the  Appellant's  account  that  whilst  in  Erbil,
      having fled the threat against him in Kifri, he had been tracked  down
      by members of SM's family [35].  The  Judge  held  at  [40]  that  the
      Appellant could not internally relocate to Baghdad  as  he  would  not
      have a host family to stay with.

9     At [41]-[45], the Judge held  that  the  Appellant  could  not  safely
      internally relocate to IKR. The reasons were as follows:

           "41.  Whilst, as argued by Ms Bird (for the Respondent),  it  is
           possible for the appellant to travel via  Baghdad  International
           Airport in transit and internally relocate to Erbil from Baghdad
           International Airport, (the airport is open and receives  direct
           flights from Baghdad International Airport)  or  indeed  to  fly
           directly from the UK to Erbil via a  European  country  such  as
           Germany ( Frankfurt Dusseldorf and Munich airports)  or  Austria
           (Vienna). And, I accept that it would be  fanciful  to  consider
           that SM's family would immediately be  alerted  to  his  arrival
           back in Dohuk, IKR. And, I note that IKR has a sizeable landmass
           and a population of circa 38 million. However, he  would  be  at
           risk within Dohuk/IKR/a large city such as Sulaymaniya  for  the
           following reasons [42-45].


           42.   Firstly I am satisfied that  the  appellant  would  be  an
           ongoing adverse interest to SA's family,  who  as  a  matter  of
           common sense are evidently 'well-to-do'  having  regard  to  the
           fact that they could afford to send their daughter to University
           where she appears in photographs with all the appearance  of  be
           expensively clad. (Although I cannot be satisfied that they have
           any specific influence in KRI as  the  evidence  of  the  family
           connection to the Zangana tribe is vague and inconclusive  -  AB
           paragraph 24).


           43.   Secondly  as  such  they  will  be  well  placed  to  make
           enquiries of  the  Appellant's  whereabouts  -  which  they  are
           reasonably likely to do as "honour codes  ...  are  embedded  in
           broader pervasive  ways of thinking that revolve  around  gender
           values and traditions that legitimize men's control  of  women's
           bodies  and  behaviour"  and  frequent,  "2,353  allegations  of
           violence against women between July and November 2013"  (AB  29-
           30).


           44.   Thirdly, the appellant is a graduate and when  he  applies
           for  a  graduate  job  there  will  be   a   limited   pool   of
           jobs/applicants of his age/status. In the context that he cannot
           be expected to lie about his qualifications, family  details  or
           date of birth or atheistic beliefs it is reasonably likely  that
           at some  stage  his  identity  would  become  known  whether  by
           accident or design and to those who want to find out.


           45.   Fourthly, there is no evidence  in  the  country  guidance
           information before me that 'honour-based offences' are  forgiven
           by the passage of time and so the point would remain at risk, up
           especially as he could not rely upon the  state  for  protection
           except by being kept in police custody (AB 31) - which would not
           be reasonable. He could not rely upon his brother to permanently
           fund a life on the run."


10    The appeal was allowed.

11    The Respondent  applied  for  permission  to  appeal  on  31.10.17  on
      grounds that the Judge had made findings which were not open to him on
      the evidence before him, specifically that -

      �     the family of the Appellant's claimed girlfriend were  'well  to
           do' (para 42)


      �     the status of the family would allow them to be 'well placed' to
           make inquiries about the Appellant's whereabouts (para 43);


      �     the Appellant was a  graduate  and  that  when  he  applied  for
           graduate jobs his details would become known to those who wanted
           to find him (para 44).


12    It was further submitted that the Judge had made sweeping  assumptions
      in order to make these findings,  and  had  failed  to  give  adequate
      reasons for his assumptions, particularly  in  light  of  the  Judge's
      finding that the Judge would not be satisfied that the family had  any
      specific influence in IKR, as the evidence of the  family  connections
      to the Zangana tribe was weak and inconclusive.

13    Permission to appeal was granted by Judge of the First  tier  Tribunal
      Mailer on 27.11. 17 on the basis that those grounds were arguable.

      Submissions

14    Mr. Bates argued  that  the  Judges's  findings  were  not  adequately
      reasoned, and that there was no proper evidential foundation  for  the
      Judge to make the findings at paragraphs 42-44.

15    There was insufficient  evidence  before  the  Judge  to  support  the
      finding that  SM's  family  was  'well-to-do';  even  if  SA  attended
      university, there was no  evidence  about  the  cost/affordability  of
      university education in Iraq. (I also note that  in  relation  to  the
      Appellant's own attendance at university, half of that costs  was  met
      by the university - SEF q 147).

16    Further, it was impermissible speculation on the part of the Judge  to
      draw any inference about the status or wealth  of  SM's  family  based
      merely on photographs showing her mode of dress on her graduation day.



17    Further, there was no evidence as to how SM's family  would  be  'well
      placed' to make inquiries about the Appellant's whereabouts, given  in
      particular the  Judge's  finding  that  the  family  had  no  specific
      influence in the IKR.  In  that  regard,  Mr  Bates  referred  to  the
      Appellant's actual evidence regarding the position of SM's family,  in
      his witness statement of 26.9.17:

           "24   SM's family is well respected  and  from  the  well  known
           tribe of Zangana. They are a large tribe and because the  matter
           is one of honour it affects the  entire  tribe.  This  tribe  is
           located all over the  Kurdish  region  including  within  Erbil,
           Suleymania and other areas. I  believe  that  they  have  motive
           drive and willingness to locate me within Iraq and to kill me."


18    If, as the Judge held, SM's family had no specific influence  in  KRI,
      as the evidence of the family connection  to  the  Zangana  tribe  was
      'vague and inconclusive', then the means by which  the  Appellant  had
      stated he would be tracked down (by the Zangana tribe) did not  exist.
      Something more, by way of evidence or reasoning, was needed to support
      a finding that SM's family would be well placed to find the Appellant.



19    Further, the Appellant's evidence about finding a job  on  return  was
      as follows:

           "25   It will be impossible for me to try and find a job because
           I would be constantly looking over my shoulder and if I worked I
           would be exposing my identity to others and this would reveal my
           location. There is also a limitation of jobs  available  in  the
           job market in Kurdistan."


20    Mr Bates argued that even if the Appellant were  to  seek  employment,
      as a graduate or otherwise, given the Judge's finding that the  family
      had no specific influence in IKR, and no established  connection  with
      the Zangana tribe, it was not explained how  SM's  family  would  ever
      come to know that the Appellant had applied for or obtained employment
      in IKR.

21     Further,  in  order  to  determine  whether  there  was  any   proper
      evidential foundation for the Judge's findings, Mr Bates also referred
      me to the country information which was before the Judge  in  relation
      to the issue of honour crimes in Iraq. That was set out at pages 25 to
      34 of the Appellant's Bundle. Pages 25 to 28 were an extract from  the
      Respondent's Operational Guidance, v  10.1  dated  31.12.13  (reissued
      22.8.14) which contains at para  3.13  onwards  a  section  on  honour
      crimes. It provides:

           "3.13.2 Treatment UNHCR's Eligibility  Guidelines  of  May  2012
           noted  that  so-called  "honour  crimes"  -  that  is,  violence
           committed by family members to protect  the  family's  honour  -
           reportedly remain of particular concern. Most frequently,  women
           and girls and, to a lesser extent, men and boys, are  killed  or
           subjected to  other  types  of  violence  such  as  mutilations,
           because they are judged to have transgressed cultural, social or
           religious norms bringing shame to their family."


      and

           "3.13.17  There might be cases where men are at risk  of  honour
           crimes for committing certain acts which have brought  shame  on
           their family. Effective protection is unlikely to  be  available
           and, if in such a case internal relocation is considered  unduly
           harsh, then Humanitarian Protection will be appropriate."


22    Further, at pages 29-34 is an Immigration and Refugee Board of  Canada
      Response to Information  Request  on  honour  based  violence  in  the
      Kurdistan region of Iraq  dated 15 February 2016. There is  a  section
      at 1.2 entitled 'Male victims of honour based violence'':

           'Information on male victims of honour-based violence was scarce
           among the sources consulted by the Research  Directorate  within
           the time  constraints  of  this  Response.  Citing  the  country
           representative  for  Diakonia,  an   international   development
           organization (Diakonia 27 Sept. 2013) in the city of Dahuk,  the
           Danish fact-finding mission report states that "men are  equally
           at risk of becoming victims of honour crimes as women"  (Denmark
           2010,  3).  In  contrast,   in   the   opinion   of   the   WADI
           representative, boys and men are "not  very  likely"  to  become
           victims of honour-based violence in Iraqi  Kurdistan,  and  when
           they are affected, "most" of the time it  is  due  to  "supposed
           homosexuality" (WADI 25 Jan. 2016). A March 2014 article by  Dr.
           Gill similarly states that


                 'men are most likely to cause  dishonour  as  a  result  of
                 their behaviour towards women, including through (i)  their
                 choice of romantic and/or sexual partners, (ii) refusing an
                 arranged marriage, (iii) coming out as  gay,  bi-sexual  or
                 transgender, and/or (iv) refusing to commit an act  of  HBV
                 [honour-based violence].  Nevertheless,  the  fact  remains
                 that the majority of victims are female and the majority of
                 perpetrators male. (Gill 14 Mar. 2014)'


           The 2015 Ceasefire Centre for  Civilian  Rights  and  MRG  joint
           report states that men are "occasionally" the victims of honour-
           based violence and they are "sometimes" killed  to  restore  the
           offended family's honour (Nov. 2015, 26). According to  the  DIS
           report, the father of a girl or the husband of  a  woman  "would
           most likely kill his daughter or his  wife,"  respectively,  for
           having an "illicit sexual relationship  with  another  man.  ...
           After this, the male offender would then  be  at  high  risk  of
           being killed" (Denmark 2010, 7).


           According to sources, there is no assistance for male victims of
           honour-based violence (Denmark 2010,  9;  WADI  25  Jan.  2016).
           According to the Danish fact-finding mission report,  if  a  man
           who had sexual relations outside of marriage feared honour-based
           violence and approached the police, "he  would  most  likely  be
           offered protection. However, the only possible way for him to be
           protected would be to be kept in police custody," which  is  not
           viable in the long-term as staying in prison is "not  a  durable
           solution" (Denmark 2010, 10).  Corroborating  information  could
           not be  found  among  the  sources  consulted  by  the  Research
           Directorate within the time constraints of this Response.


           Further information on the situation of male victims of  honour-
           based violence, including protection, could not be  found  among
           the sources consulted by the  Research  Directorate  within  the
           time constraints of this Response."'


23    Mr Bates submitted that such  evidence  indicated  that  honour  based
      violence was predominantly experienced by women, not men;  that  those
      at risk, whether women or men, were predominantly at risk  from  their
      own family; and where men were at risk, the  evidence  suggested  that
      this was often  as  a  result  of  being  perceived  to  have  brought
      dishonour of their own  family,  for  their  perceived  homosexuality.
      There was nothing in that evidence which the Appellant could  rely  on
      to support the Judge's findings in internal flight to IKR.

24    By way of her submissions Miss Patel provided a rule  24  reply  which
      in summary argued  that the Judge was entitled to draw the  inferences
      as he did, based on his findings of fact about the Appellant's account
      and relying on the country information before him, as referred  to  in
      the decision. There was no error of law in the decision.

      Discussion

25    I find that there is a material error of law in the Judge's  decision,
      there  being  no  proper  evidential  foundation   for   the   Judge's
      conclusions, which are, to use the Respondent's  expression  'sweeping
      assumptions', that SM's  family  was  'well-to-do',   making  it  well
      placed to make enquiries about the Appellant's whereabouts,  and  that
      it was reasonably likely that at some stage his identity would  become
      known to those who wanted to find out, ie SM's family.

26    I adopt the submissions of the Respondent.  Given  in  particular  the
      finding that SM's family, in Diyala province, in Central and  Southern
      Iraq, had no specific influence in IKR, and their connection with  the
      Zangana tribe was not made out, it is simply  not  apparent  from  the
      Judge's decision how they  would  be  in  a  position  to  locate  the
      Appellant  in  IKR,  whether  through  a  potential  employer  of  the
      Appellant, or otherwise.

27    Further, the fact that SM attended university, which may  or  may  not
      have been paid for by her family, and that on her graduation day,  she
      had 'all the appearance of being expensively  clad'  are  not  matters
      which properly support a finding that the  family  was  affluent.  The
      cost of SM's clothes (even if expensive looking), whether such clothes
      were easily afforded by her family, or  even  whether  they  were  her
      clothes, are all unknown.

28    Further, the Judge appears to find the likelihood that  the  Appellant
      will apply for a 'graduate job', which were  said  to  be  limited  in
      number, increases the chances of his detection, but without specifying
      how SM's  family would, in the absence of any  network  of  informers,
      contact potential employers, which are ill-defined, and  of  uncertain
      number, to ask about the Appellant.

29    I find that in the absence  of  any  reference  to  some  other,  more
      direct evidence, of SM's family's ability to trace  the  Appellant  in
      IKR, the Judge has arrived at findings of fact which were not open  to
      him on the evidence available, and/or has failed to give  reasons  for
      his decision which were adequate in law.

30    The error was material to the outcome of the appeal.

31    I set the decision aside.

      Remaking

32    Miss Patel requested an adjournment for the Appellant to give  further
      oral evidence as to SM's family's ability to trace him, and to  obtain
      further country information to support that point.

33    Standard directions were issued in this appeal,  following  the  grant
      of permission to  appeal on 27.11.17. Those directions gave notice  at
      para 4 that there would be  presumption  that  in  the  event  of  the
      Tribunal deciding the decision of the  FtT  is  to  be  set  aside  as
      erroneous in law, the remaking of the decision would take place at the
      same hearing, normally based on the evidence before the FtT,  and  any
      further evidence submitted under paragraph 5 of the directions,  which
      set out the power of the Upper  Tribunal  to  permit  new  or  further
      evidence to be admitted under Rule  15(2A)  of  the  Procedure  Rules.
      Further, paragraph 8 of the  standard  directions  provides  that  any
      request for the services  of  an  interpreter  must  be  made  to  the
      tribunal writing, at least seven  days  in  advance  of  the  schedule
      hearing date.

34    There was no Rule 15(2A) application made prior to the hearing of  the
      appeal before me, and no request for an interpreter.  Miss  Patel  did
      not identify any specific country evidence upon  which  the  appellant
      may seek to rely in addition to the material already  before  me.   Mr
      Bates objected to an adjournment, and requested I remake the  decision
      on the basis of the present evidence.

35    At the hearing, I reserved my decision as to whether  I  would  remake
      the decision following the hearing, or adjourn and re-list before  the
      Upper Tribunal on a later  date  to  allow  the  Appellant  to  submit
      further evidence. I requested the parties to give me their submissions
      as to re-making, however (as referred to below).

36    Having reserved my decision as to  whether  the  Appellant  should  be
      afforded a further hearing, I find that there is  no  adequate  reason
      for adjourning the present appeal and relisting it. Having  regard  to
      the overriding objective to deal with cases fairly and justly, I  find
      that the Appellant has not identified any particular  issue  on  which
      further oral evidence is reasonably required. The  Judge  had  already
      rejected the Appellant's claim that SM's family traced him to the IKR,
      and his claim that SM's family had connections with the Zangana tribe,
      and that tribe would find the Appellant. These findings have not  been
      shown to have been vitiated by any error of law.

37    I distinguish my decision in the present case not to adjourn,  from  a
      case management decision I made in another case in the list before  me
      on the same day, which Miss Patel may well have observed,  to  adjourn
      for further oral evidence to be given, coincidentally  on the issue of
      internal relocation to the IKR in another Iraqi appeal, on  the  basis
      that the First tier Judge in that other matter had  made  no  findings
      whatever as to that appellant's ability to relocate to IKR, or  as  to
      his claimed fear of a clan there (not the Zangana).

38    I therefore remake the decision based on the evidence before  me,  and
      the submissions I received from the parties as to remaking.

39    Mr Bates relied on his previous submissions,  and  argued  that  there
      was no adequate evidence available to how the Appellant would be found
      by SM's family,  and  argued  that  internal  relocation  to  IKR  was
      reasonable.

40    For her part, Miss Patel took me  through  some  of  the  material  as
      already set out at paragraph 21 and 22 above, and  argued  that  there
      remained a real risk of serious harm to the Appellant as a male victim
      of threatened honour crime. Further, internal relocation  to  IKR  was
      not possible, not on the basis that the present Appellant  was  unable
      to enter and remain in IKR, but rather on the basis that he  would  be
      found there and seriously harmed by SM's family, and that no effective
      protection would be available to him.

Findings

41    I find, accepting that some men can be the victims  of  honour  crime,
      and adopting the Judge's finding that there is a risk of harm  to  the
      Appellant in Kifri, that the Appellant has not established by evidence
      that there is any reasonable degree of  likelihood  that  SM's  family
      would be able to find him in IKR. They do not live there; they have no
      particular influence there; the Appellant  has  not  established  that
      SM's family have connections to any influential tribe there; it is not
      established  that  SM's  family  is  affluent;   SM's  attendance   at
      university in Erbil is not I find a  sufficient  evidential  basis  to
      find that SM's family has sufficient wealth and influence to  be  well
      placed make enquiries about the Appellant's whereabouts  in  IKR;  and
      the means by which a family, outside IKR,  and  having  no  particular
      influence or connections within IKR, would make enquiries of potential
      employers  of  a  person  seeking  employment  within  IKR,   is   not
      established by the Appellant.

42    The Judge proceeded on the basis that the Appellant  could  enter  and
      remain in IKR. That issue is not disputed before me.

43    The Respondent having raised internal relocation  to  IKR  within  the
      refusal letter, the Appellant has not made  good  his  assertion  that
      internal relocation to IKR is not available to him.

      Decision

44    I find that the making of the  decision  involved  the  making  of  an
      error of law.

45    I sent aside the decision.

46    I remake the decision, dismissing the Appellant's appeal.
