Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr M. Reyaz, Solicitor
For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal from the decision of Judge Hillis sitting  at  Bradford
   on the 3rd October 2016 in which he dismissed the appeal against  refusal
   of the appellant's application for an EEA Residence Card as  confirmation
   of his right of residence as the partner of an  EEA  national  exercising
   her European Community Treaty rights in the United Kingdom  as  either  a
   self-employed or a self-sufficient person.

2. The appellant is a citizen of Senegal and his partner,  Ms  Aicha  Diara,
   is a citizen of the Czech Republic. The original application was made and
   considered by the Secretary of State on the basis that  Ms  Diara  was  a
   self-employed domestic cleaner. Judge  Hillis  upheld  the  Secretary  of
   State's view that the evidence in support of this claim demonstrated that
   such work  was,  at  best,  "marginal  or  supplementary"  and  that  she
   accordingly did not  qualify  as  a  "self-employed  person"  within  the
   meaning of regulation 6  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
   Regulations 2006. There has been no challenge to  this  aspect  of  Judge
   Hillis's decision.

3. However, the grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  also  argued,
   in the alternative, that Ms Diara qualified as a "self-sufficient person"
   within the meaning of the regulation 6 (see paragraph 16 of Judge Hillis'
   decision). Judge Hillis duly considered this ground,  apparently  without
   objection from the Home Office Presenting  Officer.  His  conclusions  in
   this regard can be found at paragraphs 21 and 22 of his decision -


      21. I reject the Appellant's claim that his partner is self-sufficient
        as she cannot claim to be such due to the income from his
        employment with Tesco Stores which on his latest wage slip shows a
        gross monthly income of GB�1864-88.


      22. In my judgment self-sufficiency involves income from any source
        that is the EEA national's income and not that of their non-EEA
        national partner. By seeking to rely on the Appellant's own
        personal income this shows that the EEA national partner is not
        only not self-sufficient but is, in fact, financially dependent on
        her non-EEA national partner, namely, the Appellant and, therefore,
        does not meet the definition of a "qualified person" within the
        Regulations.

4. There was agreement between the representatives at the hearing that  this
   conclusion wass legally incorrect. The true position is as stated by  the
   Court of Justice of the European Union in the decision of Kuldip Singh  C
   - 218/14 in which it was held as follows -

    The Court has previously held that  the  expression  'have'  sufficient
    resources in that provision  [Article  7(1)(b)  and  (2)  of  Directive
    20014/38] must be interpreted as meaning that  it  suffices  that  such
    resources are available to the Union citizen, and that  that  provision
    lay down no requirement whatsoever as to their origin, since they could
    be provided inter alia by the third country national.

5. That position is reflected in the definition of 'self-sufficient  person'
   within regulation 4 in which the emphasis is simply upon the EEA national
   having "sufficient resources  not  to  become  a  burden  on  the  social
   assistance system of the United Kingdom during his period of residence".

6. Although it was not pursued by Mr Diwnicz at the hearing before  me,  the
   respondent's Rule 24 response argues that (a)  the  principle  in  Kuldip
   Singh applies only to what it describes an  "installed"  family  member's
   earnings, and (b) given Judge Hillis' finding that  Ms  Diara's  business
   was a 'sham' from the outset, subsequent contributions by  the  appellant
   cannot have had the effect of bestowing upon her the status of  a  'self-
   sufficient person'. It thus appears to be argued that in order to  be  "a
   self-sufficient  person",  the  EEA  national  must  already  have   been
   exercising Community Treaty rights prior to becoming dependent  upon  the
   third country national. However, the decision in Kuldip  Singh  does  not
   seem to me to contemplate any such restriction upon  the  right  of  free
   movement and no other authority is cited by the respondent in support  of
   this proposition. The notion that a third country  national  is  able  to
   create the very circumstances that gives  an  EEA  national  a  right  to
   reside in the host state may well be considered counter-intuitive. It  is
   however consistent with the underlying objective  of  ensuring  that  EEA
   nationals do not become "a burden upon the social security system of  the
   United Kingdom".

7. Given that it was not disputed that the appellant's gross monthly  income
   of �1,864.88 was sufficient to ensure that neither  he  nor  his  partner
   would be a burden on the social security system of the United Kingdom, Mr
   Diwnicz realistically accepted that he was unable to argue that the error
   of law was immaterial to the outcome of the appeal or, indeed,  that  the
   appeal ought not to have been allowed upon a correct application  of  the
   law to the facts as found.

Notice of Decision

8. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to  dismiss  the  appeal  is  set
   aside and substituted by a decision to allow the appeal.
