                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


     1. In a determination promulgated following a hearing at North Shields
        on the 13th June 2013 First-tier Tribunal Judge Hands dismissed the
        appeals  of  all  three  appellants  against  the  refusal  of  the
        Respondent to grant entry clearance as the spouse and  children  of
        someone present and settled in the United Kingdom.


     2. The first appellant is female and was born on the 18th  July  1964.
        The remaining appellants are her son and daughter born in 1995  and
        1996 respectively.


     3. The determination was challenged on the basis Judge Hands dismissed
        the appeal by reference to  the  maintenance  requirements  of  the
        Rules, specifically in terms of the level of income  required.   It
        is said this issue was not referred to by  the  respondent  in  the
        refusal notice, at the hearing, or by the Judge and the Judge erred
        in her assessment of the level of income  required.  Permission  to
        appeal was refused by another judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  on
        the basis that even if the Judge has erred it has  not  been  shown
        the required level of income was available.  Permission  to  appeal
        was granted on a renewed application by the Upper Tribunal.


     4. Judge Hands, in paragraph 15 of the determination, stated that  the
        level of income required was "in the region of �280 per week" which
        is �1,160 per month. When the figure for the rent and  council  tax
        was added, the figure increased to �1,610 per  month.  The  sponsor
        was found to have an income of �1,545 per month which is less  than
        the required amount and so it was  found  the  appellants  had  not
        proved they could be adequately maintained.


     5. The Judge is criticised in the grounds seeking permission to appeal
        for not explaining how she arrived at the figure she  did  for  the
        benefit entitlement figure of �280 per  week.  Mr  Latif  submitted
        that the correct figure is �243.79 per week which, when adding  the
        rent and council tax figure equates to �1506.42 per month which  is
        less that that relied upon by Judge Hands and the available income.
        On this basis it is said the appeals should be allowed.


     6. The Upper Tribunal, in granting permission  to  appeal,  noted  the
        alleged  procedural  irregularity  of  determining  the   case   by
        reference to an issue not  previously  raised  without  giving  the
        parties an opportunity to respond has no merit for in paragraph  14
        of the  determination  Judge  Hands  refers  to  the  fact  it  was
        mentioned, and submissions made upon this point. The reason for the
        grant was the reference by Judge Hands to  the  required  level  of
        funds being "in the region of �280 per week" which not  only  lacks
        precision but is said to be factually incorrect by Mr Latif.


     7. Directions were issued  to  the  parties  to  provide  calculations
        demonstrating the correct level of income support it is alleged  is
        required to meet the requirements of paragraph 281 and as  per  the
        guidance provided  in  KA  and  Others  (Adequacy  of  maintenance)
        Pakistan [2006] UKAIT 00065.  As  the  date  of  decision  is  11th
        October 2012 it is the rates of benefits payable at this date which
        is applicable.  It is unfortunate that such  an  issue  has  to  be
        resolved by the Upper Tribunal which could have  been  avoided  had
        the appellants followed the guidance provided by  the  Tribunal  in
        the case of Ahmed (benefits: proof  of  receipt;  evidence)  [2013]
        UKUT 84(IAC).


     8. The schedules now provided show that it is accepted by both parties
        that the benefit payment to a couple is �111.45 per week  to  which
        must be added �64.99 for each dependant child  making  a  total  of
        �241.43 per week.   The difference between them is the inclusion in
        the Respondents calculation of an additional sum of �17.40 per week
        for the Family Premium which increases the figure  to  �258.83  per
        week, still substantially less than the figure relied upon by Judge
        Hands of �280.


     9. The rental figure of �350 and Council tax of �100 per months is not
        disputed which Mr Latif submitted gives a final figure of  �1496.19
        per month but on the Respondents figures � 1571.59  per  month.  Mr
        Latif submits this is lower than the  figure  calculated  by  Judge
        Hands and less than the available income figure. On the Respondents
        figures the total is more than the available income referred to  by
        the Judge but only by �26.59 per month.


    10. In relation to the applicability of the  Family  Premium  Mr  Latif
        submitted that as it was  not  certain  that  the  appellants  will
        receive this premium it should be disregarded. I find no  merit  in
        such a submission. The Family Premium will be paid if a claimant or
        their partner is responsible for, and in the same household  as,  a
        dependant child under 16 years of age.  As  the  second  and  third
        appellants are below this age  the  benefit  provisions  show  that
        there is no doubt that the Premium will be  paid  and  so  must  be
        included in the calculation. I find  the  correct  figure  is  that
        relied upon by the Respondent.


    11. It is also submitted Judge Hands erred in assessing  the  available
        income by reference to a gross rather than net figure. The evidence
        demonstrated a weekly net income for the sponsor from Mr  A  Basith
        T/A Kebab House of �150 and a �200 net weekly income from Seahouses
        Indian Restaurant Ltd giving a net weekly income of �350.


    12. Reverting to weekly figures, the rent equates  to  �80.76  and  the
        Council Tax to �23.07 meaning the accommodation costs total �103.83
        per week. As per the guidance provided in Ahmed the calculation  is
        therefore �350 - �103.83 = �246.17 which is  �12.66  short  of  the
        weekly income support threshold.  These figures, bar that  relating
        to the Family Premium, were not challenged by Mr Latif.


    13. There was  before  Judge  Hands  evidence  of  available  funds  of
        �1038.45 in the sponsor's Lloyd TSB bank account which I  can  take
        into account - see Jahangara Begum and others (maintenance savings)
        [2011] UKUT 246.  The visa is of 27 months duration (117 weeks) and
        dividing the savings by this period provides  an  additional  �8.87
        per week leaving a shortfall of �3.79 on which  basis  I  find  the
        appellants are unable to meet the maintenance requirements  of  the
        Rules. As a result any error made by Judge Hands is not material to
        her decision to dismiss the appeal under the Rules.


    14. Although not pleaded in the Grounds Mr Latif also  sought  to  rely
        upon Article 8 ECHR but this was not raised in the original grounds
        of appeal or the skeleton argument prepared for the hearing  before
        Judge Hands and does not appear to have been pursued before her. As
        such it cannot be an error for the Judge not to have dealt with  it
        and no legal error is proved.


    15. Even if there was a valid Article8 claim it has not been shown that
        it is bound to succeed. Although this is a family seeking  to  join
        the sponsor in the UK  the  core  issue  under  the  Rules  is  the
        inability to meet the maintenance requirements  of  paragraph  281.
        It is said to be unfair on the appellants but I find  no  merit  in
        this argument as the case law and Rules set out the accepted  legal
        principles  that  are  Article  8  compliant.  The   argument   the
        appellants may not be able to succeed under the requirements of the
        rules in force after 9th  July  2012  is  noted  but  a  person  is
        required to meet the minimum requirements in force at the  date  of
        application and it is not possible to say such requirements  cannot
        be met in light of the fact the sponsor's income will  be  assessed
        at the date of a future application.


    16. The requirement to demonstrate the availability of a minimum income
        is to ensure parties do not become reliant upon  public  funds.  In
        AAO v Entry Clearance Officer [2011] EWCA Civ  840   the  Court  of
        Appeal held that  as  Strasbourg  and  domestic  jurisprudence  had
        consistently emphasised, States were entitled  to  have  regard  to
        their system of immigration  control  and  a  requirement  that  an
        entrant should be maintained without recourse to public funds was a
        fair and  necessary  limitation  on  what  would  otherwise  be  an
        overwhelming burden on all its citizens.


    17. The fact the shortfall may be thought to be 'minor' does not  allow
        the appellants to succeed per se. The Supreme Court  in  Patel  and
        others v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC  72
        has now effectively held that there is no  near  miss  argument  as
        such albeit that all facts  have  to  be  taken  into  account  and
        considered in context.


    18. In this appeal there has been insufficient evidence  to  show  that
        the decision is wrong  in  law.  The  Respondent  relies  upon  the
        economic needs of the UK being  protected  by  the  enforcement  of
        effective immigration controls which is a strong  argument  as  the
        income support figure is a minimum requirement it is said a  family
        need to avoid destitution.  In Momotaz  Begum  (18699)  (Ockelton),
        the  Tribunal  rejected  the  suggestion  that,  just  because   an
        appellant is a member of a particular community, his or  her  needs
        might be more modest than would otherwise  be  the  case.   As  the
        Tribunal stated "It is no part of the  policy  of  the  Immigration
        Rules to enable immigration in  order  to  form  a  ghetto,  or  to
        promote a situation in which those who arrive in this country  from
        abroad are expected  to  live  at  a  standard  below  the  minimum
        tolerated by others.  That is the function of  the  requirement  of
        "adequacy" in the Immigration Rules.  It  is  not  enough  for  the
        appellants to show that they have enough  money  to  survive:  they
        must show that they would be adequately maintained without recourse
        to public funds. What, then, is necessary for adequate maintenance?
         The level of income support is  often  used.   Income  support  is
        certainly not riches: but, as it is what is provided for  a  person
        or family who has no other income, and, as a  recipient  of  income
        support is expected to be able to live on it, the respondent is  in
        a sense estopped from saying that  that  level  of  income  is  not
        adequate".


    19. The Respondent has established the decision is proportionate on the
        known facts.  No material error is proved.

Decision

    20. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity.


    21. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.  I make no such order pursuant to rule  14  of  the  Tribunal
        Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
