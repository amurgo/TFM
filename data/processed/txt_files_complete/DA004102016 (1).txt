Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REMITTAL

 1. The parties are as described above,  but  the  rest  of  this  decision
    refers to them as they were, and will be again, in the FtT.

 2. The SSHD appeals against a decision by First-tier Tribunal Judge  David
    C  Clapham  SSC,  promulgated  on  18  November  2016,   allowing   the
    appellant's appeal against deportation.

 3. On 10 March 2011, the Sheriff at Edinburgh ordered the  extradition  of
    the appellant to Poland.  On 1 March 2012, the Appeal Court, High Court
    of Justiciary, quashed that order: [2012] HCJAC 33.  The  Lord  Justice
    General said (by reference to  section  27(4)(b)  the  Extradition  Act
    2003) at �28, "The ultimate question for  this  court  is  whether  the
    appellant's mental condition is such that it  would  be  oppressive  to
    extradite him", and at �32 answered that question, "I find this to be a
    very narrow case but have come ultimately to the view that this  appeal
    should be allowed".

 4. At �52 the FtT Judge said, "If the High Court of  Justiciary  concluded
    that it would be oppressive to extradite the appellant it appears  that
    it must follow that it would be disproportionate to deport him".

 5. Mr Jones sought valiantly to persuade us that  the  decision  could  be
    read  to  show  that  the  Judge  did  not  conflate  deportation  with
    extradition, did not base his decision only on following  the  decision
    of the Court, gave it  no  more  than  appropriate  weight,  implicitly
    weighed  all  other  relevant  factors,  and  reached  a  view  of  the
    appellant's mental condition and risks  current  at  the  date  of  the
    hearing which was justified in absence of up to date medical  evidence.
    However, we were not persuaded that such a reading could be extracted.

 6. The Judge made it plain at �47, 48 and 52 that but for the decision  of
    the High Court he would have come to the opposite view.

 7.  We  have  some  concern  over  whether  it  is  right  to  express   a
    proportionality assessment based on all factors bar one,  and  then  to
    see if that makes any difference, rather than giving all factors  their
    due weight; but that is not  the  error  which  leads  us  to  set  the
    decision aside.

 8. The decision of the High Court was an important point of departure, but
    the considerations in extradition and  in  deportation  case  are  very
    different, and the decision was almost 5 years previously.

 9. The Judge thought at �48 that in the absence of up-to-date reports  the
    only inference he  could  draw  was  that  the  medical  situation  was
    unchanged from the  time  of  the  High  Court  judgement.   There  was
    evidence which might have suggested to the Judge that the situation had
    changed, e.g. an intervening period of several years of admitted  heavy
    use of cocaine; the absence of the proposal of deportation to  serve  a
    prison sentence in Poland; not being in detention; and the  absence  of
    any information about ongoing risk of self-harm, or any further attempt
    at such.  This was not a case where only one inference could be  drawn;
    and the onus to lead evidence of the up-to-date situation  was  on  the
    appellant, not on the respondent.

10. The Judge appears at �45 and 49 to have  accepted  the  submissions  of
    counsel in the  FtT  (who  was  not  Mr  Jones)  that  deportation  and
    extradition were to be equiparated and that the situation  was  similar
    to  Devaseelan.   Both  of  those  submissions  were  ill-founded   and
    misleading.  Their acceptance by the Judge  goes  further  against  the
    interpretation of the decision sought by Mr Jones.

11. The appellant put his case to the Judge on the basis, which  the  Judge
    appears also to have  accepted,  that  deportation,  like  extradition,
    requires him to go to Poland.  It does not. It requires  him  to  leave
    the UK.  As a citizen of the EU, he is free to live not only in  Poland
    but in any member state other than the UK.  To make his case, he had to
    exclude the proportionality of his alternative choices, as to which  he
    was silent.

12. We recognise, as Mr Jones submitted,  that  part  of  the  argument  on
    proportionality was the effect on the appellant's wife  of  the  choice
    whether to leave the  life  she  has  established  in  the  UK.   That,
    however, is a factor in any fresh decision.  It cannot save the present
    decision.

13. We might have proceeded to substitute a decision based on the  evidence
    previously led, as there  has  been  no  application  for  any  further
    evidence to be considered.  However, we took  the  view  that  even  in
    absence of notice of any further evidence, we should give the appellant
    the opportunity to update his case.

14. The decision of the FtT is set aside.  None  of  its  findings  are  to
    stand, other than as a record of what was said at the hearing.

15. The nature of the case is such that  it  is  appropriate  in  terms  of
    section 12(2)(b)(i) of the 2007 Act and of Practice  Statement  7.2  to
    remit the case to the FtT for an entirely fresh hearing.

16. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Clapham.

17. An anonymity direction was  made  in  the  FtT.   The  matter  was  not
    addressed before us.  We have maintained anonymity herein.
