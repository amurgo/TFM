For the appellant:     Mr S Iqbal of Counsel
For the respondent:    Ms A Fijiwala, Senior Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, who is a national of Albania, born on 10 September  1990
    appealed against the decision of the respondent dated 9  February  2014
    to refuse him leave to remain in United Kingdom outside the Immigration
    Rules and pursuant to Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ievins  dismissed  his  appeal  in  a
    determination dated 22 September 2014.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge Mark Davies refused permission to  appeal  on
    12 November 2014. Permission to appeal was however  granted  by  Deputy
    Upper Tribunal Judge Sheridan on 9  March  2015  stating  that  it  was
    arguable that the Judge made a material error of law  with  respect  to
    its application of the case of Chickwamba [2008] UK HL 42 on the  facts
    in this appeal.

    The First-Tier Tribunal Judges Findings

 3. It is not in dispute that this is a genuine  relationship.  The  couple
    are married and do intend to live together as husband  and  wife.  That
    the appellant's difficulty is that he came to this  country  illegally.
    He met his wife in Albania so she must have visited there although  she
    is of Kosovan and not Albanian origin, and they formed  a  relationship
    and wanted to get married. The appellant  tried  five  times  by  legal
    means to come to the United Kingdom but when he  was  unsuccessful,  he
    took the illegal route. This is why his application must fail under the
    Immigration Rules. When the appellant made his application, the refusal
    which gives rights to this appeal, he did not have any leave it all  to
    enter or remain in the United Kingdom.

 4. The appellant relied on EX1 of appendix FM (c) which applies where  the
    applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner  who
    is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the UK or in  the  UK
    with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside  the  UK.  Paragraph  EX2  goes  on  to  define  insurmountable
    obstacles as meaning "the very significant difficulties which would  be
    faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their family life
    together outside the UK and which  could  not  be  overcome  all  would
    entail very serious hardship for the applicant or their partner". "I do
    not consider that the obstacles to the couple's family life  continuing
    outside   the   United   Kingdom   can   properly   be   described   as
    insurmountable."

 5. The appellant does have a separate right of appeal an Article 8 grounds
    outside the Immigration Rules.

 6. "I must also take into account the provisions of section 117A and B  of
    the immigration act 2014". "The relevant part of Section 117B  in  this
    case is subsection (4) (b) which requires that little weight should  be
    given to "a relationship formed with  a  qualifying  partner,  that  is
    established by a person that time when the  person  is  in  the  United
    Kingdom unlawfully".

 7. The Judge took into account the appellant's wife's right in respect  to
    a family life and said that there are no children involved.

 8. The Judge took into account the case of Chikwamba and stated "it is not
    necessarily unlawful to require an appellant  relies  on  human  rights
    grounds to return to his country of origin to make an  application  for
    entry  clearance".  The  prospective  length  and  degree   of   family
    disruption  involved  in  growing  abroad  for   an   entry   clearance
    application is a highly relevant factor. "I am told that the  financial
    requirements are met. If that is right, it  might  not  necessarily  be
    long that the couple are required to live  apart  while  the  appellant
    makes his application from Albania. Or his wife could accompany him  to
    Albania while he does so. The interference with the  right  to  respect
    for family life of both parties to the marriage required by the refusal
    of this application is proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  of  the
    United  Kingdom  in  its  economic  well-being   and   maintenance   of
    immigration control.

 9. The judge dismissed the appellant's appeal.

    The grounds of appeal

10. The appellants' grounds of appeal state the following. The appellant is
    in a genuine, durable and loving relationship with his wife  and  their
    relationship is subsisting means that they have formed a family life in
    the UK. The appellant has the right to continue with this  family  life
    in the UK. The appellant's wife is working,  generating  an  income  of
    ï¿½19,000 per annum working at  the  Rainbow  school  and  alblofts.  The
    appellant's wife therefore does meet the maintenance  requirement.  The
    appellant also has work-related skills  and  therefore  they  will  not
    require any recourse to public funds  to  maintain  themselves  in  the
    United Kingdom.

11. The judge fell into material error when he concluded that the obstacles
    to the couple's family  life  continuing  outside  the  United  Kingdom
    cannot be properly described as insurmountable. This is clearly  not  a
    reflection of the appellant and his wife's already established  private
    and family life in the UK.

12. The judge has not taken into account that the appellant's  wife  has  a
    job which makes a positive difference, to many  children's  lives.  The
    appellant wife also intends to study for her PhD in the United Kingdom.
    Therefore the appellant's wife's expectations and  ambition  cannot  be
    broken. It is an integral part of the Immigration Rules to consider all
    family members who will be affected by not granting the appellant leave
    to remain in the United Kingdom. The appellant's  wife  should  not  be
    deprived of his basic and fundamental human right.

13. As the appellant has apologised and is remorseful for  his  actions  he
    should have been granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom.  It  is
    important  to  note  that  the  appellant  has  previously  made   five
    applications to enter  the  United  Kingdom  lawfully  which  were  all
    refused. The appellant had initially applied for a student visa  in  to
    study and to be together with his wife. The applications were  refused.
    The appellant then applied for a tourist visa in order  to  spend  time
    with his wife in this country and this was also refused.  At  the  time
    the appellant could not apply for a spouse Visa as he was not 21  years
    of age. Consequently the appellant  came  to  the  United  Kingdom  and
    humbly apologises for the same. At a tender age of  20,  the  appellant
    was just coming out of his teenage years. He did  not  have  sufficient
    capacity to understand the implication of his  decision  to  enter  the
    country unlawfully. The appellant is otherwise  a  good  character  and
    intends to uphold the laws of this  great  country.  Discretion  should
    therefore be applied in his favour and he be granted leave to remain in
    the United Kingdom.

14.  The  factors  that  should  be  taken  into  account  in  respect   of
    proportionality is that the appellant came to the UK in  November  2011
    and has since been living  together  with  his  wife  in  a  subsisting
    relationship. At the time the appellant was 20  years  old  so  he  has
    spent his formative years in the United Kingdom. The  appellant's  wife
    is a British citizen. The appellant was engaged  to  his  wife  in  the
    summer of 2011. She came to the United Kingdom when she was very  young
    from Kosovo. Her parents and siblings are British citizen's present and
    settled in the United Kingdom. The appellant's wife was to progress her
    career in educational psychology and complete her PhD.

    The respondent's Rule 24 response

15. The  respondent's  rule  24  response  states  the  following  which  I
    summarise. In terms of Chikwamba, it must be noted that  the  appellant
    had decided to enter the United Kingdom, notwithstanding five  previous
    refusal of entry clearance.  And  failed  both  for  want  of  a  valid
    application and on suitability grounds, and so  it  is  submitted  that
    this is more than a simple procedural ground and more akin to Ekinci.

16. The comments of Elias LJ, in I Hayat versus Secretary of State for  the
    home Department states that the situation is fact sensitive  and  there
    may be circumstances where they would be a disruption  to  family  life
    with particular importance where children are involved. This is not the
    position in the instant appeal. The sponsor while Kosovan appears to be
    ethnically Albanian and indeed the parties met  in  Albania  where  the
    sponsor holidays. No evidence appears to have been placed on the length
    of any disruption  in  the  British  Embassy  in  Tirana  deciding  the
    application or indeed any qualitative assessment of the  sponsor  being
    able to meet the substantive Immigration Rules by the first-tier  Judge
    which is merely limited to "I am told that the  financial  requirements
    are met" at paragraph 23 of the determination.

17. The Judge of the first-tier Tribunal directed  himself  as  a  two  the
    whole of section 1 170 of the Nationality Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
    2002 as amended but simply considered that section 117B (4) (b) as  the
    most pertinent. It is not readily apparent as to how the Judge erred by
    not considering the whole of the section.

18. The grounds are a disagreement with the  findings  made  by  the  Judge
    considered all the evidence applying the correct burden and standard of
    proof. The judge directed himself properly.

    Findings on Error of Law

19. I have considered the first-tier Tribunal's determination with all  due
    care and find that the judge did not make a material error of law.  The
    Judge took into account all the evidence  and  came  to  a  sustainable
    conclusion and dismissed the appellant's appeal.

20. The Judge in his determination considered  the  case  of  Chikwamba  at
    paragraph 23 and stated "it is not necessarily unlawful to  require  an
    applicant who relies on human rights grounds to return to  his  country
    of origin to make an application for entry clearance".

21. It would be helpful to set out the case of Chikwamba  where  the  issue
    for determination was framed thus:

         "In determining an appeal under section 65 of the  Immigration  and
         Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act) (now  sections  82  and  84  of  the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  (2002  Act))  against
         the Secretary of State's refusal of leave to remain on  the  ground
         that to remove the  appellant  would  interfere  disproportionately
         with his article 8 right to respect for his family life,  when,  if
         ever, is it appropriate to dismiss the appeal on the basis that the
         appellant should be required to leave the country and seek leave to
         enter from an entry clearance officer abroad?"

    In that case the appeal was allowed and it was said that:

         "I am far from  suggesting  that  the  Secretary  of  State  should
         routinely apply this policy in all but exceptional  cases.   Rather
         it seems to me that only comparatively rarely, certainly in  family
         cases involving children, should an article 8 appeal  be  dismissed
         on the basis that it would be proportionate  and  more  appropriate
         for the appellant to apply for leave from abroad."

22. The effect of this passage in Chikwamba was subsequently considered  by
    the Court of Appeal in TG (Central African  Republic)  v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2008] EWCA Civ 997.  In that case, Keene
    LJ said that:

         "These are fact-sensitive issues and inevitably there  are  factual
         differences between this  case  and  Chikwamba,  not  all  to  this
         appellant's advantage. For example, just to take two  matters,  Mrs
         Chikwamba had married at a time  when  removals  to  Zimbabwe  were
         suspended. This appellant, during some of the time when he has been
         living with his partner in this country, seems to have  disappeared
         from the official radar screen for a period of something around two
         years. Such matters as the immigration history of an appellant  are
         clearly relevant, as Lord Brown indicated himself at paragraph 42.
         Then Mrs Chikwamba, it was accepted, could not realistically  leave
         her child behind in order to seek entry clearance from Zimbabwe, so
         in that case there would have been an impact on the child who had a
         right to remain in the United Kingdom."

    Buxton LJ added that:

         "... it  is  quite  clear  that  a  very  strong  consideration  in
         Chikwamba was the fact that it was the wife who was to  be  removed
         from the country, inevitably in the companionship of her four-year-
         old child. That is made absolutely plain as the determining  factor
         in paragraph 8 of the speech of Baroness Hale of Richmond."

23. Chikwamba was again considered in R (Forrester) v  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2008] EWHC 2307 in which Sullivan  J  said  at
    paragraphs 13-14:

         "... what is the purpose of requiring the claimant and her daughter
         to return to Jamaica? I readily accept that there is a general need
         to maintain a fair and firm immigration system and to deter  those,
         who do not have  entry  clearance,  from  coming  to  this  country
         without entry clearance and, as it were, jumping or  bypassing  the
         queue. However, there is no question of the  claimant  jumping  the
         queue in the present case. There is no question of  her  coming  to
         this country when she did not have entry  clearance.  She  came  to
         this country entirely lawfully. She was in  this  country  lawfully
         for a number of  years  and  the  only  reason  why  her  continued
         presence was not lawful was the fact that a cheque [sent  with  her
         application for further leave to remain as the  spouse  of  someone
         who was present and settled in the United Kingdom] was not honoured
         by her bank. It is one thing to say that one should have a fair and
         firm immigration policy, it is quite another to say that one should
         have an immigration policy which is utterly  inflexible  and  rigid
         and pays not the slightest regard to the  particular  circumstances
         of the individual case."

    In paragraph 41 of the speech of Lord Brown  [in  Chikwamba]  he  asked
    whether the real rationale for the policy was:

         "... perhaps the rather different  one  of  deterring  people  from
         coming to this country in the first place without  having  obtained
         entry clearance and to do so by subjecting those who do come to the
         very substantial disruption of their lives  involved  in  returning
         them abroad?"

24. The Judge in his determination found that the case  of  Chikwanba  does
    not exempt the appellant from satisfying the requirement to  obtain  an
    entry clearance from his  home  country.  The  Judge  clearly  did  not
    understand Chikwamba to  say  that  an  appellant  can  circumvent  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules if he is already in  the  country
    and therefore should not be required to return to his home  country  to
    make an application in the appropriate category. Chikwamba states  that
    only in exceptional cases and cases  which  normally  involve  children
    that it would  not  be  proportionate  and  more  appropriate  for  the
    appellant to apply for leave from abroad.

25. The Judge in a comprehensive assessment of the appellant  circumstances
    was entitled to find that the appellant should  return  to  Albania  to
    make his entry clearance application. This is a sustainable  conclusion
    take into account the circumstances of the appellant.

26. The Judge  considered  the  case  of  Beoku-Betts  (FC)  (Appellant)  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 39 and took into
    account the appellant's wife's rights pursuant to Article 8  and  found
    that she could either accompany the appellant to  Albania  for  him  to
    make his entry clearance application or remain in the  United  Kingdom.
    The important fact that the Judge took into account is that  there  are
    no children to be taken into account.

27. Although the Judge referred only to subparagraph  (4)  (b)  of  section
    117B as the relevant part of the section to be taken into  account,   I
    find this is not a material error of  law  because  the  Judge  clearly
    understood that he has to take into account the respondent's interest.

28. I find that there is no error of law in the determination of the first-
    tier Tribunal Judge and I uphold the decision.
