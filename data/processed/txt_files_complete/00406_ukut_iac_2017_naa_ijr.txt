          Before The Honourable Mr Justice McCloskey, President and
                         Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson





            Application for judicial review: substantive decision

                  [given orally on 11 July 2017 and edited]

Having considered all papers lodged, together with the submissions of  Ms  N
Braganza, of counsel, instructed by Latitude Law Solicitors,  on  behalf  of
the Applicant and  Mr  S  Karim  QC,  instructed  by  the  Government  Legal
Department, on behalf of the Respondent, at a hearing  at  Manchester  Civil
Justice Centre on 11 July 2017


   i) A proposal by a Tier 1 Entrepreneur applicant who operates an existing
      business to use part of the prescribed minimum finance of �200,000  to
      purchase a second business for the purpose of developing and expanding
      the existing enterprise  is  compatible  with  paragraph  245  of  the
      Immigration Rules.


  ii)  An  immigration  interview  may  be  unfair,  thereby  rendering  the
      resulting decision unlawful, where inflexible structural adherence  to
      prepared questions excludes the spontaneity  necessary  to  repeat  or
      clarify obscure questions and/or to probe or elucidate answers given.


      McCLOSKEY P

The Applicant's Challenge

 1. The Applicant, a national of Pakistan now  aged  39  years,  challenges
    primarily a decision  of  the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  of  Islamabad
    (hereinafter the "ECO"), 18 May 2015, refusing his  application  for  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Visa to enable him to enter the  United  Kingdom.
    There is also a challenge to the ensuing administrative review decision
    of  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  ("ECM")  dated  17  September  2015
    affirming the primary decision.  These refusals were maintained by  the
    response dated 06 November 2015 to the pre-action protocol letter.


 2. There is a relevant history in what has regrettably become something of
    a saga.  The impugned refusal was preceded by an earlier refusal  dated
    15 February  2015  and  the  withdrawal  thereof  on  the  basis  of  a
    concession that there  has  been  an  unlawful  failure  to  apply  the
    Respondent's  soi-disant   "evidential   flexibility"   policy.    This
    concession entailed the withdrawal of  the  original  decision  in  its
    entirety.  This withdrawal, dated 27 April 2015, was  the  impetus  for
    the main impugned decision.  There followed  a  fresh  decision  making
    process giving rise to the successive refusal decisions now  challenged
    in these proceedings.  The main impugned decision (as noted above)  was
    made on 18 May 2015, in the immediate aftermath of an interview of  the
    Applicant by the ECO conducted on the same date.


 3. The initial order of the Upper Tribunal was one refusing permission  to
    apply for judicial review on the papers.  This was reversed by a  later
    order, dated 09 January  2017,  in  the  wake  of  an  oral  permission
    hearing.  As a result the Applicant's challenge proceeds on two central
    grounds,        namely        procedural         unfairness         and
    misconstruction/misapplication  of  the  relevant  provisions  of   the
    Immigration Rules (the "Rules").

 4. It is appropriate to acknowledge the care with  which  the  Applicant's
    case has been prepared and presented.  This is  reflected  particularly
    in the formulation of the "Amended Grounds and Reply"  in  response  to
    the Respondent's detailed grounds of defence.  This step, rarely taken,
    is expressly permitted by the Upper Tribunal's standard case management
    directions which issue when permission is granted.  It is a most useful
    device in certain cases and I would strongly recommend  greater  resort
    to it.  In this  context  I  refer  to  the  guidance  contained  in  R
    (Mahmood)   v   Secretary   of   State   for   the   Home    Department
    (Candour/Reassessment Duties; ETS; Alternative Remedy) IJR [2014]  UKUT
    439 (IAC).


The Rules

 5. The moderately dense code enshrined in paragraphs 245 D  &  DB  of  the
    Immigration Rules (the "Rules") is, for convenience, reproduced in  the
    Appendix to this judgment.




The Main Impugned Decision


 6. In refusing the application, the ECO, having referred to the  threefold
    requirement prescribed by the Rules that the applicant have access to a
    minimum of �200,000 which is held in one of  the  "regulated  financial
    institutions" and is "disposable in the United Kingdom" concluded  that
    none of these stipulations was satisfied.   This  conclusion  as  based
    upon the responses made by the Applicant during an interview held on 18
    May 2015.  In brief compass, the ECO reasoned as follows:


      a) While documentary evidence of funds of no less  than  �200,000  had
         been provided, the source of this money was not considered  "viable
         or credible" on account  of  inconsistent  responses  made  by  the
         Applicant when interviewed.


      b) Given the Applicant's stated intention to purchase an existing eBay
         shop for �50,000, ".....   you only have  a  balance  available  to
         invest of �150,732.  Given this, the �200,000  you  hold  will  not
         remain available to you until such time as  it  is  spent  for  the
         purposes of your business or businesses as  required  by  paragraph
         245 DB(f)(iii)."


      c) "During the interview you confirmed that  you  were  aware  of  the
         contents  of  your  business  plan.   However  when  asked  initial
         questions regarding the business plan you were looking  through  it
         for the information."


      d) "Once it was put aside, you were asked your projected turnover  for
         2016.  You gave an answer which did not match the  figures  in  the
         business plan. When asked to explain you stated that  the  business
         plan was based on projection and that you were now giving your 'own
         idea through experience' and that the business plan was  a  minimum
         and that you anticipated to earn more.  It is reasonable to  expect
         that a genuine entrepreneur would have a good grasp of his finances
         and these answers suggest that your  market  research  detailed  in
         your plan and the reality are two different things as  far  as  you
         are concerned. This suggestions that any  research  is  either  not
         believed or that you have not undertaken this research as  claimed.
         These are  not  the  answers  or  actions  I  would  expect  of  an
         entrepreneur looking to expand his business further."




 7. The decision of the ECO encompasses the following omnibus conclusion:


         "Given all of this, I am not satisfied that the funds you hold  are
         genuinely available to you, that you genuinely intend to invest the
         money in a business or businesses in the UK or that  you  genuinely
         intend to establish or take over a business or  businesses  in  the
         UK."


    Both the speed and depth of the initial challenge to the ECO's decision
    are worthy of note.  Just two days  later  the  Applicant's  solicitors
    formulated a  detailed  challenge  in  a  letter  dated  20  May  2015.
    Sequentially, the next document is  a  letter  from  the  British  High
    Commission of Islamabad, dated 17 September 2015.  This adverts to  the
    receipt of the Applicant's request for administrative review on 03 June
    2015 and affirms the decision of the  ECO.   Carefully  analysed,  this
    repeats, albeit in slightly different language, the first and fourth of
    the reasons summarised above, viz (a) and (d).  The above mentioned pre-
    action protocol ("PAP") letter followed, on 23 October 2015.


 8. Notably, in response to the latter, the ECM abandoned the first of  the
    four refusal reasons viz (a).  The terms of this concession are  worthy
    of note.  The ECM, having  referred  to  the  interview  questions  and
    answers relating to the availability to the Applicant of the  requisite
    minimum fund of �200,000, identified  two  defects  in  the  interview.
    First, the ECO "... did not challenge you further on this point  ...  "
    (concerning the source of availability of the requisite funds).  Second
    he had "... inaccurately  interpreted  your  response  in  the  refusal
    notice" (being the Applicant's response on this discrete  issue).   The
    second reason viz (b) was maintained, in these terms:


         "It is clear from [the Rules] that the not less than  �200,000  you
         must hold must be genuinely available to you and  remain  available
         to you until such time as it is  spent  for  the  purpose  of  your
         business or businesses and buying a business from a previous owner,
         where the money goes to that previous owner rather  than  into  the
         business, is excluded from the definition of 'spent'."




    Maintaining the fourth of the aforementioned refusal reasons  viz  (d),
    the Respondent drew attention to the projected turnover  of  �2,489,643
    in the Business Plan and  the  projection  of  �300,350  given  by  the
    Applicant in interview, continuing:


         "As you will note, your proposed  turnover  is  significantly  less
         than the amount detailed in your business plan for your  forecasted
         turnover  in  2016  and  therefore  this  undermines  your  overall
         credibility and your justifications for the varying forecasts given
         by you and contained within your business plan.  Such a significant
         difference in a financial forecast between you  and  your  business
         plan is not indicative of a genuine entrepreneur with a viable  and
         credible business plan."




    Finally,  the  ECM  rejected  the  Applicant's  assertions   that   the
    interviewing officer had been "confrontational and rude" and that  some
    of the answers given had been misinterpreted.


 9. Pausing briefly, by this stage the distance separating the parties  had
    narrowed  considerably.   The  refusal  of  the  Applicant's   Tier   1
    application was being maintained on the sole ground  that  (a)  he  was
    planning to spend �50,000 of the requisite minimum fund of �200,000  in
    a certain way which (b) is not permitted by the Rules.  We observe that
    the foundation of this refusal consists of two inter-related  exercises
    in interpretation.  First, the interpretation of certain questions  and
    answers during the interview.  Second, the manner in which the ECO  and
    ECM had interpreted certain provisions of the Rules.

The Applicant's Case


10. Paragraph 245D(c) of the Rules stipulates  that  the  minimum  funds  -
    �200,000 - remain available to the applicant "until such time as it  is
    spent for the purposes of his business or businesses".  There follows a
    definition of "available" which is not germane in the present  context.
    This in turn is followed by a provision which explains what  "invested"
    or "spent" excludes.  There are four excluded types of expenditure:


      i) The applicant's own remuneration.


     ii) Buying the business from a previous owner, where the money goes  to
         that previous owner rather than into the business.


    iii) Investing in businesses other than those  which  the  applicant  is
         running as self employed or as a director.


     iv) Any spending which is not directly for the purpose of  establishing
         or running the applicant's own business or businesses.


      Each of these prohibited forms of expenditure is disjunctive.




11. Ms Braganza developed the procedural  unfairness  ground  of  challenge
    succinctly. Fundamentally, the terms in which the Applicant's responses
    to certain  important  questions  were  recorded  are,  she  submitted,
    manifestly incomplete, unclear or unintelligible.  Elementary  fairness
    required the ECO to follow up on certain answers  for  the  purpose  of
    clarification, explanation and elimination.  There was a failure to  do
    so.  The interview record was,  on  its  face,  manifestly  unreliable.
    These shortcomings were of  obvious  materiality  since  the  interview
    record was of pivotal importance in the successive  refusal  decisions.
    Finally, Ms Braganza highlighted that successive  failures  to  respond
    affirmatively to requests to disclose  the  interview  record  were  in
    breach of the relevant guidance.

12. At this juncture it is appropriate to focus on certain aspects  of  the
    Applicant's interview record.  In response to question  17,  he  stated
    that during the previous five years -


         "... I have been working for eBay and I established a business
         there as well."




    He was then asked "What type of business?", replying:


         "I have online shop through eBay."


    Next, he explained the goods which he sold via this business.  Question
    20 asked:


         "What do you plan to do if you are granted entry clearance as a  T1
         Entrepreneur?"


    The Applicant responded:

         "I will promote the same business by generating my own website  and
         I will promote it through eBay who have 20,000  positive  feedback.
         They want me to invest �50,000 ....


         [Our emphasis]


         21.      Who wants you to invest that? ....


         It is my own business plan I desire to invest this money."


    ["invest" is verbatim]




    In response to question 24, the Applicant reiterated his  intention  to
    invest �200,000 in his business.  There followed  these  questions  and
    answers:


         "26.     Can you tell me the breakdown of how you will  invest  the
             [�200,000]?


         In online business sale is directly proportional to listing.


         27.      I want to know how you will  invest  the  �200,000.   What
             will you spend it on?


         It depends on the number of orders.  The more orders I get  online,
         the more items I will export from Pakistan, China and India.


         28.      But you have not told me how you need to invest  �200,000.
             You already have a business and are already trading.


         According to  the  business  plan,  �80,000  will  be  required  to
         decorate my office.  I am doing a business deal with a company  who
         need �50,000 which I will have to pay.


         29.      What kind of deal is that, what will you get from it?


         It is an established shop through eBay company and I intend to take
         over it.  Their yearly sale is about [�320,000].  I  will  need  to
         import the material in containers.  One container will  cost  about
         �40,000 including 10 more selling items which are currently popular
         in the market."


         30.      So �50,000 of your money will  be  to  buy  this  existing
             business?


         Yes, I will take over."


      [Our emphasis]




13. At this juncture we interpose the following  analysis.   The  Applicant
    made clear that all of the funds would be  invested  in  his  business.
    The key fact is that he has an existing business.  He was not proposing
    to engage in the prohibited activity of purchasing "the" business  from
    someone else.  Rather he was proposing to acquire another online retail
    entity which would be added to and amalgamated with his existing online
    business.  This would entail investment in and expansion of his  extant
    business. None of this can in our view be gainsaid.

14.  We  remind  ourselves  of  the  well-established  principle  that  the
    construction of any document is a question of law.  In the  absence  of
    any witness statement evidence from  the  Respondent,  we  analyse  the
    interview record in the following way.

15. Those in attendance were the Applicant, the ECO  (interviewer)  and  an
    interpreter.  The ECO evidently asked the questions in  English,  these
    were then translated into Urdu, the Applicant replied in Urdu  and  the
    interpreter then translated his replies  into  English.   The  ECO  was
    typing both the questions and the answers as the interview  progressed.
    There was no audio recording.


16. At the outset of the interview the Applicant confirmed that the ECO was
    speaking audibly.  The initial questions were evidently of the routine,
    pro-forma variety.   Some  of  the  ensuing  questions  were  evidently
    prepared in advance.  Others were plainly reactive to  the  Applicant's
    replies.  At the conclusion of the interview the questions and  answers
    were not read to the Applicant.  Nor was he given  the  opportunity  of
    reading the document.  He was not invited to comment upon,  correct  or
    amplify any of the responses recorded.  Notably there was no attempt to
    explore  or  clarify  the  two  manifestly  incoherent  responses   (as
    recorded) noted above viz to questions 21 and 26.   It  is  also  clear
    that around the middle of the interview the Applicant was reproached by
    the ECO for "flicking through" a copy of his Business Plan and desisted
    as a result.  This is suggestive of an approach  which  was  unfriendly
    and an atmosphere of discomfort.

17. One striking feature of the interview record is that the Applicant  was
    not asked any questions about the content of his  Business  Plan.   Nor
    did the interviewing ECO attempt to correlate any  of  the  Applicant's
    replies to the latter.  Furthermore, this exercise was not attempted in
    the ensuing refusal decision, the subsequent affirmation thereof or the
    response to the PAP letter. There was at no time any exploration of the
    link clearly made in the Business Plan between the Applicant's existing
    business ("UK Bargain Outlet") and his proposed future business  ("Xeon
    Traders Limited").  In the Business Plan it is stated:


         "This  business  plan  for  Xeon  Traders   Limited,   an   already
         established eBay top ranking bedding retailer with the name  of  UK
         Bargain Outlet, has been written to ascertain  feasibility  of  the
         current business and future expansion plans.  The plan  details  UK
         and Europe bedding industry structure, trends, future potential and
         outlines the future strategic course  of  action  of  Xeon  Traders
         Limited."


    None of this was either explored with the  Applicant  in  interview  or
    addressed in the successive decisions and reviews which materialised.

18. A brief perusal of the Business Plan makes abundantly  clear  that  the
    Applicant was proposing to enlarge and develop his  existing  business.
    For example:


         "Started in early 2013 Xeon Traders Limited  ('the  company')  blue
         print lies in the growing online market for homeware and bedding in
         Europe, especially the United Kingdom.  A business which started as
         a part time activity is one of the top ranked and  fastest  growing
         bedding shops on eBay ....


         As a part of its  growth  plan  Xeon  Traders  Limited  intends  to
         increase its web presence by launching its own website and start  a
         new wholesale business."




    The above passage is contained in the "Company Summary" section.    The
    direct nexus between the existing  business  and  the  proposed  future
    expansion is also clear from the  "Management  Summary"  section.   The
    following extract from the "Financial Plan" is also of significance:


         "Xeon  Traders  Limited  financial  plan  has  all   the   required
         ingredients required  for  providing  expansion  of  the  business,
         paving the way for new investments and providing enough fiscal room
         to change the  way  in  which  the  company  conducts  business  in
         changing business environment."


    [Our emphasis.]


    In the "Projected Profit and Loss" section, it was represented that the
    net income of the business would rise to  �267,331  by  2017.   In  the
    "Projected Balance Sheet" total  assets  of  �1,166,717  by  2017  were
    forecast.  None of the foregoing was probed, explored or highlighted in
    the questions posed by the ECO.

19. We consider, based on what they have written and  taking  into  account
    the interview record, that  neither  the  ECO  nor  the  ECM  correctly
    appreciated  those  features  of  the  Applicant's  business   proposal
    addressed above.  This misunderstanding is rooted in, inter  alia,  the
    procedural unfairness of the interview and engages the  further  public
    law misdemeanours of irrationality and mistake of fact.  Linked to this
    is  the  negative  assessment  of  the  Applicant's  response  to   the
    "projective turnover" (sic) question 36:

         Q. "What is your projective [sic] turnover for 2016?


         A. �300,350 from one shop which I am currently running".


    This invites the following brief analysis:


    (a)    The question was both  unfair  and  confusing  as  the  relevant
         section of the  Business  Plan  did  not  employ  the  language  of
         "turnover" and this  was  neither  defined  nor  clarified  by  the
         interviewer.


    (b)    There was a manifest failure by both the  ECO  and  the  ECM  to
         appreciate that the Applicant's response related  to  his  existing
         business, rather than his planned enlarged future business.


    (c)    Neither the ECO nor the ECM took cognisance  of  the  figure  of
         just under  �300,000  (�286,354)  in  respect  of  "earning  before
         interest and taxes" for the year 2016 in the Business Plan.


    (d)    The possibility of evolving circumstances and plans was ignored.


    Once again this (viz  the  response  to  question  36)  is  a  paradigm
    illustration of an answer crying out for further  probing,  exploration
    and clarification: there was none.

20. At this juncture we turn to examine  the  governing  legal  principles.
    This  Tribunal  had  occasion  recently  to  review  the  doctrine   of
    procedural fairness in R  (AM)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2017] UKUT 262 (IAC), at [76] particularly:


         "While the decision of the House of Lords in R  v  SSHD,  ex  parte
         Doody and Others [1994] 1 AC 531 involved a very different context,
         namely the release of prisoners sentenced to life  imprisonment,  I
         consider  that  the  terms  in  which  Lord  Mustill  devised   his
         celebrated code of procedural fairness makes clear that  it  is  of
         general application.  Furthermore, its association with the EU  and
         ECHR legal rules and principles  outlined  above  is  unmistakable.
         The passage in question (at page 560D) is not susceptible to cherry
         picking and demands reproduction in full:


              'My Lords, I think it unnecessary to  refer  by  name  or  to
             quote from, any of the often-cited authorities  in  which  the
             courts  have  explained  what  is  essentially  an   intuitive
             judgment.  They are far too well known. From  them,  I  derive
             that (1) where an Act of Parliament confers an  administrative
             power there is a presumption that it will be  exercised  in  a
             manner which  is  fair  in  all  the  circumstances.  (2)  The
             standards of fairness are not immutable. They may change  with
             the passage  of  time,  both  in  the  general  and  in  their
             application  to  decisions  of  a  particular  type.  (3)  The
             principles  of  fairness  are  not  to  be  applied  by   rote
             identically in  every  situation.  What  fairness  demands  is
             dependent on the context of the decision, and this  is  to  be
             taken into account  in  all  its  aspects.  (4)  An  essential
             feature of the  context  is  the  statute  which  creates  the
             discretion, as regards both its language and the shape of  the
             legal and administrative system within which the  decision  is
             taken. (5) Fairness will very often require that a person  who
             may be  adversely  affected  by  the  decision  will  have  an
             opportunity to make representations on his own  behalf  either
             before the decision is  taken  with  a  view  to  producing  a
             favourable result; or after  it  is  taken,  with  a  view  to
             procuring its modification; or  both.  (6)  Since  the  person
             affected  usually  cannot  make   worthwhile   representations
             without knowing what factors may weigh against  his  interests
             fairness will very often require that he is  informed  of  the
             gist of the case which he has to answer.'"




    In the same decision, this Tribunal took cognisance of what was  stated
    concerning interviews of immigrants in R (Mapah) v Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department [2003] EWHC 306 (Admin) at [62]:



         "(1)     Problems of interpretation can and do occur;






         (2)      Questions, translated into the  applicant's  language  and
             replies given in that language, are not recorded as  such  but
             in the English translation;






         (3)      Records cannot always, despite exhortation,  be  literally
             verbatim;






         (4)      The reversal of the requirement for read  back  removed  a
             measure of protection against unremarked mistakes in recording
             by the interviewer;






         (5)      An applicant does not  necessarily  have  the  benefit  of
             representation or his own interpreter.  Such an applicant will
             be at a disadvantage in identifying errors of translation;






         (6)      Immigration officials and Tribunals of  Appeal  frequently
             judge credibility against a criterion of consistency;





         (7)      Tape recording of an interview by the applicant or by  the
             Secretary of State would do much to alleviate  these  problems
             if and when they occur."


21. In R (Dirshe) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2005]  EWCA
    Civ 421, the Court of Appeal,  having  cited  the  above  passage  with
    approval, said the following of asylum interviews, at [14]:


   "The interview is a critical  part  of  the  procedure  for  determining
         asylum decisions.  It provides the applicant with an opportunity to
         expand on or explain his written account and  for  the  respondent,
         through the interviewing officer, to test that account and  explore
         any apparent inconsistencies in that account.  The interview  could
         well be critical to any determination by either the  respondent  or
         appellate authorities as to the credibility of the applicant.   The
         record of the interview is created by the interviewing officer, who
         is acting on behalf of the respondent.  It  follows  that  fairness
         requires that  the  procedure  should  give  to  the  applicant  an
         adequate opportunity to challenge its reliability or adequacy."



    Latham LJ continued, at [16]:


         "So long as the Secretary of State continues with the  practice  of
         relying upon a written record of the interview in its present form,
         the applicant must have an adequate  means  of  ensuring  that  the
         record is, as we have said, both accurate and reliable."




    Notably, the Court then highlighted the variably factors of the  skills
    and  qualifications  of  the  interpreter  and  the  quality   of   the
    transcription by the interviewing officer, together with the  issue  of
    digest (or summary).  The Court  emphasised  the  vital  importance  of
    providing a tape recording of such interviews.  While we are  alert  to
    the differing context which prevailed in Dirshe, the general  tenor  of
    the judgment and the procedural concerns which it identifies apply with
    a degree of modification and clearly resonate in the present litigation
    context.


22.  We  conclude  without  hesitation  that  the  Applicant's   procedural
    unfairness challenge is made out.  This  conclusion  is  based  on  the
    analysis and reasons set out above.  The single enduring reason for the
    refusal of the Applicant's Tier 1 application was based on a series  of
    interview answers which on any reasonable  and  fair  showing  demanded
    further probing and clarification,  together  with  a  linkage  to  the
    Business  Plan,  in  particular  those  passages   highlighted   above.
    Furthermore structurally, for the reasons given  above,  there  was  an
    inherent risk that the interview would  give  rise  to  a  procedurally
    unfair substantive  decision.   This  risk  duly  materialised  in  the
    present case.

23. We turn to consider the second ground of challenge.  In succinct  terms
    the Secretary of State's  case  is  that  the  impugned  decisions  are
    sustainable because, on the  basis  of  certain  replies  made  by  the
    Applicant during interview, he was proposing to expend �50,000  of  the
    minimum fund of  �200,000  for  a  purpose  prohibited  by  the  Rules.
    Assuming that this contention is based on a correct construction of the
    Rules, we consider that it must fail for the reasons given  above.   In
    short the significant procedural deficiencies in the interview have the
    effect that the factual foundation necessary for  this  assessment  was
    plainly lacking.  This assessment was not lawfully open to the  ECO  or
    ECM by reason of the procedural deficiencies which we have diagnosed.

24. Independently, we consider that this assessment is unsustainable in law
    on  the  further  basis  that  it  entails  a  misconstruction   and/or
    misapplication of the Rules.  We begin by reminding  ourselves  of  the
    correct approach to every exercise of construction of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  In Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16,  Lord  Brown
    stated at [10]:


         "The Rules are not to be construed with the  strictness  applicable
         to the construction of a statute or  a  statutory  instrument  but,
         instead, sensibly according to the natural and ordinary meaning  of
         the  word  used,  recognising  that  they  are  statements  of  the
         Secretary of State's administrative policy."




    In Odelola v Secretary of State for the Home Department  [2009]  1  WLR
    1230, Lord Hoffman stated at [4] that construction  "...  depends  upon
    the language of the rule, construed against the relevant background".




25. Paragraph 245D(a) is the dominant, umbrella provision.  It states:


         "This route is for migrants who wish to  establish,  join  or  take
         over one or more businesses in the UK"


    [Our emphasis]


    There is no  suggestion  that  the  Tier  1  Entrepreneur  requirements
    enshrined in paragraph 245 et seq of  the  Rules  exclude  an  existing
    business.  The Applicant's application was not refused on  this  basis.
    We take this as  our  starting  point.   Nor  has  this  argument  been
    canvassed on behalf of the Respondent.  The key provision of the  Rules
    in the present context is  paragraph  245D(ii)(2).   We  consider  that
    there is  no  complexity  or  sophistication  in  either  the  language
    employed or the clear intent of the words.  This provision of the Rules
    prohibits the purchase of the business concerned from a previous  owner
    where the applicant intends  to  draw  the  purchase  monies  from  the
    minimum fund of �200,000.  The rule states clearly that the expenditure
    of any part of the  funds  for  this  purpose  is  prohibited.   Stated
    succinctly, that is not this case.


26. Furthermore, this provision of the paragraph 245 r�gime is  not  to  be
    considered in isolation.  Rather it must be  evaluated  in  conjunction
    with all that precedes and follows it in this discrete  compartment  of
    the Rules.  Inter alia, there is no prohibition against taking over  an
    existing business.  Indeed this  is  expressly  permitted.   One  asks,
    rhetorically, how a takeover could realistically  be  effected  in  the
    real world of commerce in the absence of financial  or  other  valuable
    consideration.  Furthermore, the use  of  the  definite  article  ("the
    business") is, in our judgement, of some importance. The phraseology of
    this section of the Rules also includes "business or businesses",  "one
    or more businesses", "proposed business activities" and "his business".
     Fundamentally,  the minimum fund of �200,000 must be invested  in  the
    existing  or  proposed  business  or  businesses.    This   is   stated
    emphatically in paragraph 245D(c): the whole of  the  minimum  fund  of
    �200,000 must be "spent for the purposes of [the applicant's]  business
    or businesses".


27. Having considered these assorted provisions as a  whole  and  in  their
    full context, we are satisfied that where a Tier 1  applicant  operates
    an existing business, the Rules do not prohibit the use of part of  the
    minimum  fund  to  purchase  a  second  business  for  the  purpose  of
    developing and expanding the existing enterprise.  This represents, par
    excellence, investment in the Tier 1 business.  It does not  fall  foul
    of the  mischief  of  a  smokescreen  application  which  will  involve
    investment of some or all of the minimum fund in something  else.   Nor
    does it encroach upon the related mischief  of  successive  non-British
    business owners engaging in chain sales of the same business.   On  the
    contrary  it  is  clearly  harmonious  with  two  of  the  identifiable
    underlying purposes of the Tier 1 scheme namely the  promotion  of  the
    United Kingdom  economy  and  the  maintenance  of  properly  regulated
    immigration control.

28. We  consider  it  clear  from  the  Applicant's  responses  during  the
    interview that this permitted activity, namely utilisation of  part  of
    the funds to purchase a second business for the  purpose  of  expanding
    and developing  an  existing  enterprise,  is  precisely  what  he  was
    proposing to do with a portion - �50,000 - of his �200,000 fund.   This
    is clear from his replies to the questions considered as  a  whole,  in
    particular questions 17, 20, 21 and 28 - 30.  Thus this aspect  of  the
    Applicant's business proposal was permitted by the Rules.  From this it
    follows that the ECO and ECM misinterpreted, or misapplied,  the  Rules
    provisions in question.  We therefore  reject  the  centrepiece  of  Mr
    Karim's argument.  The Applicant's second ground of challenge  succeeds
    accordingly.




Omnibus Conclusion and Remedy

29. On the grounds and for the reasons  elaborated  above  the  Applicant's
    challenge succeeds.  The appropriate remedy is an  order  quashing  the
    impugned decisions.  The effect of this order is  that  the  Respondent
    must remake the impugned decisions duly guided by this judgment and, in
    particular,  giving  full  effect  to  the  principles  of   procedural
    fairness.

Costs

30.  The  Respondent  will  pay  the  Applicant's  costs,  to  be  assessed
    summarily.

      Dated:           12 July 2017


                  [Given orally on 11 July 2017]





                                  Appendix


245D. Purpose of this route and meaning of business
   1. (a) This route is for migrants who wish to establish, join or take
      over one or more businesses in the UK.
   2. (b) For the purpose of paragraphs 245D to 245DF and paragraphs 35 to
      53 of Appendix A 'business' means an enterprise as:
        1. (i) a sole trader,
        2. (ii) a partnership, or
        3. (iii) a company registered in the UK.
   3. (c) Where paragraphs 245D to 245DF and paragraphs 35 to 53 of Appendix
      A, refer to money remaining available to the applicant until such time
      as it is spent for the purposes of his business or businesses:
        1. (i) 'Available' means that the funds are:
              1. (1) in the applicant's own possession,
              2. (2) in the financial accounts of a UK business which he is
                 running as a member of a partnership or as a director, or
              3. (3) available from the third party or parties named in the
                 application under the terms of the declaration(s) referred
                 to in paragraph 41-SD(b) of Appendix A.
        2. (ii) 'Invested' means that the funds have been invested into a
           business or businesses which the applicant is running as self-
           employed or as a director or member of a partnership. 'Invested'
           or 'spent' excludes spending on:
              1. (1) the applicant's own remuneration,
              2. (2) buying the business from a previous owner, where the
                 money ultimately goes to that previous owner (irrespective
                 of whether it is received or held directly or indirectly by
                 that previous owner) rather than into the business being
                 purchased (This applies regardless of whether the money is
                 channelled through the business en route to the previous
                 owner, for example by means of the applicant or business
                 purchasing 'goodwill' or other assets which were previously
                 part of the business.),
              3. (3) investing in businesses, other than those which the
                 applicant is running as self-employed or as a director, and
              4. (4) any spending which is not directly for the purpose of
                 establishing or running the applicant's own business or
                 businesses.

     viii) any other relevant information.

k) The Entry Clearance Officer reserves the right to request additional
   information and evidence to support the assessment in (f) or (i), and to

   reconsideration of the decision.

n) The applicant must, unless he provides a reasonable explanation,  comply
   with any request made by the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  to  attend  for
   interview.
