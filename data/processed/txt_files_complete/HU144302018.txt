             (ii) additional savings of an amount equivalent to  2.5  times
                   the amount which is  the  difference  between  the  gross

         E-ECP.3.2.  When determining whether the financial  requirement  in
         paragraph E-ECP. 3.1. is met only the  following  sources  will  be
         taken into account -


         (a)  income of the  partner  from  specified  employment  or  self-
             employment, which, in respect of a partner returning to the UK
             with the applicant, can include specified employment or  self-
             employment overseas and in the UK;


         (b)  specified pension income of the applicant and partner;


         (c)  any  specified  maternity  allowance  or  bereavement  benefit

             partner;


         (d)  other specified income of the applicant and partner; and


         (e)  specified savings of the applicant and partner."


 3. Appendix FM-SE (Family members  -  specified  evidence)  sets  out  the
    specified evidence which applicants need to provide, in order  to  meet
    the requirements of the rules contained in Appendix FM.   At  paragraph
    13 of Appendix FM-SE (calculating gross annual  income  under  Appendix
    FM), we find the following:-


         "13.  Based  on  evidence  that  meets  the  requirements  of  this
             Appendix, and can be taken into account with reference to  the
             applicable provisions of  Appendix  FM,  gross  annual  income
             under paragraphs E-ECP.3.1., E-LTRP.3.1.,  E-ECC.2.1.  and  E-
             LTRC.2.1. will, subject to paragraph 21A of this Appendix,  be
             calculated in the following ways:


             (a)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date  of  application,  has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for at least 6 months and has  been  paid
                  throughout the period of 6 months prior  to  the  date  of
                  application at a level of gross annual salary which equals
                  or exceeds the level relied upon  in  paragraph  13(a)(i),
                  their gross annual income will be (where  paragraph  13(b)
                  does not apply) the total of:


                  (i)  The level of gross annual salary relied upon  in  the
                      application;


                  (ii) The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and


                  (iii)    The gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      State pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner.


             (b)  Where the person is in salaried employment in the  UK  at
                  the date of application and has  been  employed  by  their
                  current employer for less than 6 months  (or  at  least  6
                  months but the person does not rely on  paragraph  13(a)),
                  their gross annual income will be the total of:


                  (i)  The gross annual salary from employment as it was  at
                      the date of application;


                  (ii) The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and


                  (iii)    The gross annual income  from  a  UK  or  foreign
                      State pension or a private pension received  by  them
                      or their partner.


                  In addition, the requirements of paragraph 15 must be met.


             (c)  Where the  person  is  the  applicant's  partner,  is  in
                  salaried employment outside of  the  UK  at  the  date  of
                  application, has been employed by their  current  employer
                  for at least 6 months, and is returning to the UK to  take
                  up salaried employment in the UK starting within 3  months
                  of their return, the person's gross annual income will  be
                  calculated:


                  (i)  On the basis set out in paragraph 13(a); and also


                  (ii) On that basis but substituting for the  gross  annual
                      salary at paragraph 13(a)(i) the gross annual  salary
                      in the salaried employment in the UK  to  which  they
                      are returning.


             (d)  Where the person is the applicant's partner, has been  in
                  salaried employment outside of the UK within 12 months  of
                  the date of application, and is returning  to  the  UK  to
                  take up salaried employment in the UK  starting  within  3
                  months of their return, the person's gross  annual  income
                  will be calculated:


                  (i)   On  the  basis  set  out  in  paragraph  13(a)   but
                      substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph
                      13(a)(i) the gross  annual  salary  in  the  salaried
                      employment in the UK to which they are returning; and
                      also


                  (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 15(b).


             (e)  Where the person is  self-employed,  their  gross  annual
                  income will be the total of their gross income from  their
                  self-employment [(and that of their partner if that person
                  is in the UK with permission to work)], from any  salaried
                  or non-salaried employment they have had or their  partner
                  has had (if their partner is in the UK with permission  to
                  work), from specified non-employment  income  received  by
                  them or their partner,  and  from  income  from  a  UK  or
                  foreign State pension or a  private  pension  received  by
                  them or their partner, in the last full financial year  or
                  as an average of the last two full financial  years.   The
                  requirements  of  this  Appendix  for  specified  evidence
                  relating to these  forms  of  income  shall  apply  as  if
                  references to the date of application were  references  to
                  the end of the relevant financial year(s).   The  relevant
                  financial year(s) cannot be combined  with  any  financial
                  year(s) to which paragraph 9 applies and vice versa.


             (f)  Where the person is self-employed,  they  cannot  combine
                  their  gross  annual  income  at  paragraph   13(e)   with
                  specified savings in order to meet  the  level  of  income
                  required under Appendix FM.


             (g)  Where the person is not relying on income  from  salaried
                  employment or self-employment, their gross  annual  income
                  will be the total of:


                  (i)  The gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-employment
                      income (other than pension income) received  by  them
                      or their partner in the 12 months prior to  the  date
                      of application; and


                  (ii) The gross annual income from a UK  or  foreign  State
                      pension or a private  pension  received  by  them  or
                      their partner.


             (h)  Where the person is the applicant's  partner  and  is  in
                  self-employment outside the UK at the date of  application
                  and is returning to the UK to take up salaried  employment
                  in the UK starting within 3 months of  their  return,  the
                  person's gross annual income will be calculated:


                  (i)   On  the  basis  set  out  in  paragraph  13(a)   but
                      substituting for the gross annual salary at paragraph
                      13(a)(i) the gross  annual  salary  in  the  salaried
                      employment in the UK to which they are returning; and
                      also


                  (ii) On the basis set out in paragraph 13(e).


             (i)  Any period  of  unpaid  maternity,  paternity,  adoption,
                  parental or sick leave in the 12 months prior to the  date
                  of application will not  be  counted  towards  any  period
                  relating to employment, or any period relating  to  income
                  from employment, for which this Appendix provides.


             (j)  The provisions of  paragraph  13  which  apply  to  self-
                  employment and to a person who is self-employed also apply
                  to income from  employment  and/or  shares  in  a  limited
                  company based in the UK of a type  to  which  paragraph  9
                  applies and to a person in receipt of such income.


             (k)  Where the application relies on the employment income  of
                  the applicant and the sponsor, all of that income must  be
                  calculated either under subparagraph 13(a) or  under  sub-
                  paragraph  13(b)  and  paragraph  15,  and  not  under   a
                  combination of these methods."



C. THE RESPONDENT'S DECISION

 4. On 7 June 2018, the respondent refused the appellant's application  for
    entry clearance.  The letter of refusal  had  this  to  say  about  the
    eligibility financial requirement, which was the only matter at issue:-

         "Eligibility Financial Requirement


         You have stated in your Visa Application Form  that  you  meet  the
         financial requirement through salaried employment.  I am  not  able
         to take into account any potential employment you have available to
         you in the UK  or  any  offers  of  financial  support  from  third
         parties.  In order to meet the financial requirements  of  Appendix
         FM your sponsor needs a gross income of at least �18,000 per annum.
          You state that your sponsor is employed  by  Renowned  Investments
         Limited since 01/04.2917 and earns an annual salary of �30,000.  As
         evidence of your sponsor's employment you have submitted 6  months'
         payslips covering the period August 2017 to January 2018 and Lloyds
         Bank statements covering the period August 2017 to January 2018.


         The Immigration Rules state that in respect of salaried  employment
         in the UK, all of the following evidence must be provided.


         (a)  Payslips covering


         (i) a period of 6 months prior to the date of  application  if  the
         person has been employed by their current employer for at  least  6
         months (and where paragraph 13(b) of this Appendix does not apply);
         or (ii) any period of salaried  employment  in  the  period  of  12
         months prior to the date of application  if  the  person  has  been
         employed by their current employer for less than 6  months  (or  at
         least 6 months but the person does not rely on paragraph  13(a)  of
         this Appendix), or in the financial year(s) relied upon by a  self-
         employed person.


         (b)  A letter from the  employer(s)  who  issued  the  payslips  at
             paragraph 2(a) confirming: (i)  the  person's  employment  and
             gross annual salary; (ii)  the  length  of  their  employment;
             (iii) the period over which they have been or  were  paid  the
             level of salary relied upon in the application; and  (iv)  the
             type of employment (permanent, fixed-term contract or agency).


         (c)  Personal bank statements corresponding to the  same  period(s)
             as the payslips at paragraph 2(a), showing that the salary has
             been paid into an account in the name of the person or in  the
             name of the person and their partner jointly.


             .    You have provided payslips for this  employment  covering
                  the period August 2017 - January 2018.  I note the  amount
                  on the pay slips from June 2018 onwards does not match the
                  amounts being  paid  in  to  your  bank  account  with  no
                  explanation for this.


             .     You  have  not  provided  a  letter  from  the  employer
                  confirming salary, length of  employment,  period  showing
                  level of salary paid or employment type.


             .    You have submitted bank statements issued by Lloyds  Bank
                  (account number ending **63) covering  the  period  August
                  2017 - January 2018.  There are discrepancies between  the
                  payment amounts on the payslips and those credited on  the
                  bank statements with no explanation for this.


         In addition we attempted to contact your employer during a  routine
         interview multiple times on 27/02/2018 and 02/03/2018, however,  we
         were unable to speak with your employer to verify your employment.


         Furthermore I do not  find  it  credible  that  your  employer  can
         conduct a business with volunteers which included yourself and then
         to offer employment to yourself on a salary of �30,000.  Given  the
         above, I am satisfied on the balance  of  probabilities  that  your
         sponsor is not genuinely employed as stated.


         To summarise you have not  provided  a  letter  from  the  employer
         confirming salary, length of employment  period  showing  level  of
         salary paid or employment type.  The amounts shown on the  payslips
         differ from those paid in to the bank account  from  June  onwards.
         We attempted to call  your  employer  during  a  routine  interview
         multiple times on 27/02/2018 and  02/03/2018,  we  were  unable  to
         contact them to verify your employment.


         I therefore refuse your application under  paragraph  EC-P.1.1  (c)
         (d) of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules (E-ECP.3.1)"


 5.  The  respondent  did  not  consider  that   there   were   exceptional
    circumstances in the appellant's case, which  would  render  refusal  a
    breach of Article 8 of the ECHR because it could  or  would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences for her or her family.  The respondent
    therefore refused the application.

D. THE APPEAL

 6. It is common ground that the refusal of the application constituted the
    refusal of a human rights claim made by  the  appellant.   Accordingly,
    the refusal gave rise to a right of appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal
    under section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002.
    Section 113(1) provides that a "human rights claim" means a claim  made
    by a person that (amongst other things) to refuse her  entry  into  the
    United Kingdom would be unlawful under section 6 of  the  Human  Rights
    Act 1998.  Section 6 prohibits a public authority from acting  contrary
    to the ECHR.  Section 84(2) of the 2002 Act states that an appeal under
    section 82(1)(b) (Refusal of a human rights claim) must be  brought  on
    the ground that the decision is unlawful under section 6  of  the  1998
    Act.

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  Following a hearing
    at Taylor  House  on  17  May  2019,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Gibb
    dismissed the appellant's appeal in a decision promulgated on  24  June
    2019.  At paragraph 6 of  his  decision,   the  judge  noted  that  any
    matters relevant to the substance of the decision under appeal  can  be
    considered by the First-tier Tribunal, including  those  arising  after
    the date of decision (section 85(4) of the 2002 Act).

 8. The judge heard evidence from the sponsor, who was cross-examined.  The
    sponsor told the  judge  that  he  had  stopped  working  for  Renowned
    Investments Ltd in April 2018 and had become self-employed.

 9. Under the heading "Findings" the judge said as follows:-

         "16. The sponsor was not a clear witness, but having said that  the
             evidence that  he  gave  about  his  previous  employment  was
             supported by a range of unchallenged evidence.  In  particular
             there was an employer's letter  and  an  employment  contract,
             supported by two documents from HM Revenue & Customs, both  of
             which showed his income, along with tax and national insurance
             paid, between May 2017 and April  2018.   The  minor  concerns
             that  arose  from  the  telephone  interview  that  the  Entry
             Clearance Officer conducted with the sponsor  were  adequately
             addressed, as was the issue of the small difference in  amount
             between the payslips and the credits to the bank statement.  I
             also accept that the sponsor's previous employer was  in  fact
             registered on Companies House.  The record of this provided by
             the appellant's Counsel was not  challenged  at  the  hearing.
             Looking  at  all  of  this  as  a  whole,   particularly   the
             documentary evidence from HMRC and Companies House, my finding
             is  that  the  sponsor  has  established  on  the  balance  of
             probabilities that he was genuinely  employed  as  claimed  by
             Renowned Investments Limited  between  April  2017  and  April
             2018, and that he  was  earning  in  excess  of  the  required
             �18,600.


         17.  I was not invited to make any findings  as  to  the  sponsor's
             financial circumstances  at  the  date  of  hearing.   It  was
             accepted that, having recently become self-employed,  and  set
             up his own company, he was not in a position  to  provide  any
             documentary evidence to establish his income."


10. At paragraph 18, the judge said that he  had  decided  to  dismiss  the
    appeal.   His  reasons  can  be  summarised  as  follows.   The   judge
    considered  it  to  be  "a  matter  of   considerable   concern"   that
    considerable time and  effort  had  been  spent  in  showing  that  the
    respondent's reasons for refusing  the  application  were  unjustified.
    This was because, in the judge's view, the appeal  "could  not  succeed
    given the change in the  sponsor's  circumstances  since  the  date  of
    decision".  The entire focus of  the  appellant's  representatives  had
    been on the position at the date of the respondent's decision,  and  on
    countering the points made by the respondent in the letter of  refusal.
    The judge considered that the representatives had "missed the glaringly
    obvious point that successfully countering the refusal would  not  lead
    to an outcome in the appellant's favour, where the  sponsor  no  longer
    met the financial requirements by the date of the hearing".  The  judge
    said that "even in the days when there were appeals  that  focussed  on
    the date of decision, it was still always the case that entry clearance
    would not have been  granted  if  relevant  circumstances  had  altered
    following the date of decision".

11. At paragraph 20,  the  judge  concluded  that,  in  the  light  of  his
    findings, "the decision [of the respondent] was not justified, in  that
    the appellant has established that he was  employed  as  claimed.   The
    suitability point falls with the point about his earnings".  The  judge
    acknowledged that this "may lead the appellant and the sponsor to  feel
    a sense of injustice, in that if the decision had been  correct,  entry
    clearance might have been granted".   Nevertheless,  according  to  the
    judge, from the moment the sponsor left his job  in  April  2018,  "the
    entire  legal  position  changed".   Success  for  the  appellant  was,
    thereafter, "going to depend on  the  sponsor  gathering  together  and
    presenting sufficient evidence to establish earnings over the  required
    level".

12. At paragraph 21, the judge accepted that there "may  be  certain  cases
    where an appeal can  succeed  on  Article  8  grounds  even  where  the
    financial and specified evidence requirements are not met".  The  judge
    observed, however, that no submission to that effect had been  made  in
    the present case.  There was no mention in the  witness  statements  or
    other  documents  "that  could  form  the  basis  of   an   exceptional
    circumstances Article 8 argument".

E. PERMISSION TO APPEAL

13. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was refused  by  the  First-
    tier Tribunal on 13 September 2019.  On  10  October  2019,  the  Upper
    Tribunal refused the appellant's renewed  application  for  permission.
    The grounds of application were  drafted  by  the  appellant's  present
    solicitor, Mr Seelhoff, who had not appeared before First-tier Tribunal
    Judge Gibb.

14. Mr Seelhoff's grounds submitted that the First-tier Tribunal judge  had
    failed to follow the process of questions and answers set out  by  Lord
    Bingham in R (Razgar) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2004] UKHL 27 at paragraph 17.  The questions are:-

         "(1) Will the proposed removal [or, as here, refusal to  admit]  be
             an interference by a public authority with the exercise of the
             ... right to respect for his private or [as the case  may  be]
             family life?


         (2)  If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
             gravity as potentially to engage the operation of Article 8?


         (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


         (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
             in the interests of national security, public  safety  or  the
             economic well-being of the  country,  for  the  prevention  of
             disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals,  or
             for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


         (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
             public end sought to be achieved?"


15. The grounds drew attention  to  the  fact  that,  in  paragraph  13  of
    Appendix FM-SE, where a person is in salaried employment in the  United
    Kingdom, what is required to be shown is evidence of  such  employment,
    with the same employer, for at least six months; and  evidence  of  pay
    throughout  the  period  of  the  six  months  prior  to  the  date  of
    application, at a level of gross annual salary that equals  or  exceeds
    the level  relied  upon.   The  gross  amount  of  any  specified  non-
    employment income is also to  be  determined  by  reference  to  income
    received in the twelve months prior to the date of application.

16. In the light of the positive  findings  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Gibb, the grounds  contended  that  the  appellant  had  satisfied  the
    requirements of the relevant Immigration Rules.  This  meant  that  the
    respondent could not point to the importance of maintaining immigration
    controls  as  a  factor  weighing  in  her  favour,  in  striking   the
    proportionality balance under ECHR Article 8.  In refusing to allow the
    appeal, the judge had effectively imported into the Rules a requirement
    that is not present in them; namely, a requirement to  maintain  income
    at the specified level throughout the duration of the period of initial
    entry clearance/leave  to  remain  as  a  partner  under  Appendix  FM.
    According to the grounds, the "requirement is clearly only to prove  an
    ability to earn at the level at the date of application".

F. JUDICIAL REVIEW

17. Following  the  refusal  of  permission  by  the  Upper  Tribunal,  the
    appellant sought judicial review of that refusal, by application to the
    High Court under CPR 54.7A.  On 10  December  2019,  Mostyn  J  granted
    permission to bring judicial review.  Citing  the  case  of  Marbury  v
    Madison (1803) 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137 for the  proposition  "that  where
    there is a right there must be a remedy", Mostyn J said:-

         "In my provisional opinion to say that the  appeal  hearing  is  in
         fact no more than a complete re-hearing, giving only cursory weight
         to the original  decision,   robs  section  82(1)(b)  of  its  true
         meaning.  That provision allows an appeal against a decision of the
         Secretary of State.  It does not merely say that the  tribunal  can
         make a new decision on new  evidence.   The  provision  allows  the
         decision to be challenged, root and branch.  The provision grants a
         right and in vindication of that right there must be  an  effective
         remedy.  That remedy was denied to the appellant in this case."


18. Following the  quashing,  by  High  Court  Order,  of  the  refusal  of
    permission, the application for permission accordingly comes before the
    Upper Tribunal to be decided afresh.  With the helpful  consent  of  Ms
    Cunha, we found that permission should be  granted  to  the  appellant.
    Having granted permission  orally,  dispensing  under  rule  7  of  the
    Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  with  the  relevant
    procedural requirements, we  proceeded  to  hear  submissions  from  Mr
    Seelhoff and Ms Cunha on the substantive appeal.

G. DISCUSSION

19. Ms Cunha confirmed that the respondent did  not  take  issue  with  the
    conclusion of the First-tier Tribunal Judge that the decision taken  in
    respect of the Immigration Rules was wrong, in that, as at the date  of
    application, the appellant did, in fact, meet the requirements of those
    Rules.  The question, therefore, is whether the judge was right to hold
    that the human rights appeal nevertheless fell to be dismissed.  It  is
    plain that the judge reached his conclusion because of  his  view  that
    "the entire legal position changed" when the sponsor left his  salaried
    employment in April 2018 and became self-employed.

20. There can be only two reasons why the First-tier Tribunal  Judge  would
    have been entitled to reach such a conclusion.  The first would  be  if
    the Rules were framed in such a way that the appellant not only had  to
    show her husband was  in  the  requisite  employment  at  the  date  of
    application (and had been in it for the past six months), but also that
    he had continued  in that employment, not  only  at  the  date  of  the
    respondent's decision but also at  the  date  of  the  hearing  of  the
    appellant's appeal.  In this scenario, the appellant's failure to  meet
    the requirements of the Rules would have meant she could  only  succeed
    in her human rights appeal by  showing  that  her  exclusion  from  the
    United Kingdom would still represent  a  disproportionate  interference
    with Article 8 family life.  In other words, she needed to make a  case
    for admission on human rights grounds, outside the Rules. As the  judge
    remarked, no such case was advanced on behalf of the appellant.

21. The second reason why the judge would have been entitled to dismiss the
    appeal would be if he had reason to  conclude  that,  even  though  the
    appellant met the requirements of the Rules, it was nevertheless not  a
    disproportionate interference with  Article  8  rights  to  refuse  her
    admission.

22. It is clear from paragraphs 19 and 20 of his decision that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge based his dismissal of  the  appeal  on  the  first
    reason.  He was of the view that  the  Immigration  Rules  relating  to
    income from employment have the  "ambulatory"  character  described  in
    paragraph 20 above.

23. At the end of paragraph 19 of his decision, we have seen how the  judge
    recalled that, even in the days when appeals were focussed on the  date
    of decision, it was still the position that entry clearance  would  not
    be granted, if relevant circumstances had altered.  This was,  however,
    because the pre-July 2012 Rules possessed  an  ambulatory  or  forward-
    looking nature.  An applicant had to show that there would be  adequate
    maintenance, without recourse to public funds, during the  currency  of
    the leave granted by the respondent.  The question is whether  that  is
    still the position.

24. It is well-established that the Immigration Rules are to be given their
    ordinary meaning: Mahad v Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC  16.   As
    we have seen, E-ECP.3.1. requires the applicant to  "provide  specified
    evidence from the sources listed ... of ... a  specified  gross  annual
    income of at least ... �18,600".  E-ECP.3.2. provides that only certain
    specified  sources  of  income  will  be  taken  into   account   "when
    determining whether the financial requirement in  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1.
    is met".  None of these  provisions  can,  in  our  view,  properly  be
    construed as imposing any sort of ambulatory requirement to continue in
    the  relevant  employment,  beyond  the  date  of  application.    That
    conclusion is reinforced when one examines paragraph 13 of Appendix FM-
    SE.  This paragraph is firmly focussed on the past six  months  or,  in
    some cases, twelve months, preceding the date of application.  The only
    exception is at paragraph 13(c) and (d), where the applicant's  partner
    has been outside the  United  Kingdom  but  is  returning  to  salaried
    employment within it.  Even here, however, the reference  to  paragraph
    15(b) of Appendix FM-SE focusses attention on  relevant  earnings  over
    the previous twelve months.  Particularly given the amount of detail in
    paragraph 13, it would have been perfectly possible for the  respondent
    to make specific provision if, in the case of the partner's  employment
    in the United Kingdom, the employment in question  (or  some  at  least
    equally remunerative alternative) has to subsist  beyond  the  date  of
    application.  One looks in vain for any such provision.

25. The terms of the financial requirements in  E-ECP.3.1.  also  stand  in
    stark contrast with those of  E-ECP.3.4.,  where  the  applicant  "must
    provide evidence that there will  be  adequate  accommodation,  without
    recourse to public funds, for  the  family  ..."  (our  emphasis).   E-
    ECP.3.4. is, thus, a forward-looking provision, with  the  result  that
    any materially adverse change in the accommodation position  after  the
    date of application will amount to a change in circumstances.

26. What this means is that, if any such change in the accommodation relied
    on occurs before the respondent makes her decision on the  application,
    paragraph 27 of the Immigration Rules entitles the respondent to refuse
    the application.  Paragraph 27 provides that an "application for  entry
    clearance is to be decided in the light of the  circumstances  existing
    at the time of the decision ...".  In addition, if a person is  granted
    entry clearance (and, thereby,  leave  to  enter)  but  an  Immigration
    Officer establishes, at the port of entry, that "there has been such  a
    change in the circumstances of that person's case since the  leave  was
    given, that it should be cancelled", paragraph 321A of the  Immigration
    Rules provides for the cancellation of the leave.

27. Since the Immigration Rules have been framed in such a way  as  to  fix
    the relevant financial requirements at  the  date  of  application,  it
    follows that rule 27 does  not  enable  the  respondent  to  refuse  an
    application on the basis that  the  evidenced  employment  has  ceased,
    after the date of  application.   Likewise,  paragraph  321A  does  not
    enable the respondent to cancel leave to enter at port, since there has
    been no change of circumstances in this scenario.

28. Although the present case does not involve the points-based  system  of
    Immigration Rules ("PBS"), the provisions of Appendix FM-SE share  much
    in common with it, so far as concerns the highly prescriptive nature of
    the specified evidence requirements. In the context  of  the  PBS,  the
    Higher Courts have been at pains  to  explain  that  the  reduction  in
    administrative discretion and in the  risk  of  inconsistent  decision-
    making comes at a price: see eg Mandalia v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2015] UKSC 59, paragraph 2; R (Pathan) v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2020] UKSC 41, paragraphs 1, 65,  68;  R
    (Taj) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2021] EWCA Civ  19,
    paragraph 57. An individual who might objectively be regarded as worthy
    of leave to enter or remain - and who may  under  the  previous  regime
    have  merited  the  exercise  of  discretion  in  their  favour  -  can
    nevertheless now be denied  leave,  as  a  result  of  the  mechanistic
    operation of the PBS. The PBS rules do not fall to  be  judicially  re-
    written, in order to favour such an individual. It seems to us that the
    present case is an  example  of  the  other  side  of  this  coin.  The
    respondent has decided that earnings from employment will be determined
    wholly by reference to the position up to (but not beyond) the date  of
    application. That is  her  choice.  But,  just  like  the  unsuccessful
    individuals in the cases just mentioned, she cannot expect the Tribunal
    to interpret the Rules in order to give her the best of both worlds.

29. The First-tier Tribunal judge was,  therefore,  wrong  to  dismiss  the
    appeal on the basis that the appellant did not meet the requirements of
    the Immigration Rules at the date of the hearing. That error would not,
    nevertheless, be a material one if the appeal would still  have  fallen
    to be dismissed for the second reason, set out in paragraph 21 above.

30. This means we must assess the significance in a human rights appeal  of
    the fact that the appellant meets the requirements of  the  Immigration
    Rules, which the respondent considered she  did  not  meet.  The  basic
    position is now settled.  As explained in Charles (human rights appeal:
    scope)  [2018]  UKUT  00089  (IAC),  the  significance  lies   in   the
    application of the "Razgar questions" (see  paragraph  14)  above.   If
    both questions (1) and (2) are answered in the  affirmative,  we  enter
    the realm of Article 8(2).  This provides:-

         "(2) There should be no interference by a public authority with the
             exercise of this right except such as is  in  accordance  with
             the law and is  necessary  in  a  democratic  society  in  the
             interests of national security, public safety or the  economic
             well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder  or
             crime, for the protection of health  or  morals,  or  for  the
             protection of the rights and freedoms of others."


31. As was pointed  out  at  paragraph  58  of  Charles,  the  requirement,
    addressed in question (3), that the interference be "in accordance with
    the law" can still be met, even if the application of that law  in  the
    particular circumstances of an individual case involves an error on the
    part of the respondent.  Both Strasbourg and domestic  authority  holds
    that the nature of question (3) is whether  the  proposed  interference
    has a proper basis in domestic  law,  including  whether  that  law  is
    accessible to the person concerned and foreseeable as to  its  effects.
    We consider that the relevant provisions of Appendix FM and Appendix FM-
    SE have such  a  proper  basis  and  are  sufficiently  accessible  and
    foreseeable. Question (3) is therefore answered in the affirmative.

32. Given that the Article 8 interference inherent in  the  minimum  income
    requirement of these  provisions of the Rules  has  been  held  by  the
    Supreme Court in MM (Lebanon) and Others v Secretary of State  for  the
    Home Department [2017] UKSC 10 not to be inherently unlawful,  question
    (4) falls to be answered in the affirmative.

33. As is almost always the position in cases of this kind, the  only  real
    issue is, thus,  whether  the  interference  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate public end sought to be achieved. In OA  and  Others  (human
    rights; "new matter"; s.120 Nigeria [2019] UKUT 65 (IAC),  paragraph  1
    of the headnote reads:-

         "(1) In a  human  rights  appeal  under  section  82(1)(b)  of  the
             Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, a finding that a
             person  (P)  satisfies  the  requirements  of   a   particular
             immigration rule, so as to be entitled  to  leave  to  remain,
             means that (provided Article 8 of the ECHR  is  engaged),  the
             Secretary of State will not be able to point to the importance
             of maintaining immigration controls as a  factor  weighing  in
             favour of  the  Secretary  of  State  in  the  proportionality
             balance, so far as  that  factor  relates  to  the  particular
             immigration rule that the judge has found to be satisfied."


34. In the same vein, Sir Ernest Ryder, Senior President of Tribunals  held
    in TZ (Pakistan)  and  Another  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109 that:-

         "Where a person satisfies the rules, whether or not by reference to
         an article 8 informed requirement, then  this  will  be  positively
         determinative of that person's article  8  appeal,  provided  their
         case engages article 8(1), for the very reason that it  would  then
         be disproportionate for that person to be removed."  (paragraph 34)


35. Those cases were concerned with persons, all of whom were in the United
    Kingdom. There is, however, in our view no relevant difference  between
    that category of case and the one with which we are concerned;  namely,
    an entry clearance case in which an individual wishes to live with  his
    or her settled partner in the United Kingdom. As Lord  Wilson  held  at
    paragraph 44 of MM:-

          "... while the Strasbourg court has  not  found  it  necessary  to
         carry out the  article  8(2)  proportionality  analysis  in  family
         unification cases, this Court has adopted that  approach  in  Huang
         [[2007 UKHL 11] EB (Kosovo) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
         Department [2008] UKHL 41 ... Quila [2011]  UKSC  45  ,  Zoumbas  v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] UKSC 74... and in
         Bibi [2015] UKSC 68 ... As this Court has also held in Hesham Ali v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 60 ... there
         is no objection to our employing this  useful  analytic  tool.  The
         issue is always whether the authorities have struck a fair  balance
         between  the  individual  and  public  interests  and  the  factors
         identified by the Strasbourg court have to be taken  into  account,
         among them the "significant weight" which has to be  given  to  the
         interests of children".


36. There may, of course, be situations in  which,  even  though  a  person
    shows on appeal that they meet the requirement of  a  particular  rule,
    which the respondent wrongly concluded that person did  not  meet,  and
    which led the respondent to refuse the application, circumstances have,
    nevertheless, come to light that mean the respondent  can  legitimately
    invoke some other provision of the Rules, in order to deny entry.   For
    example, it may subsequently appear that deception has been employed or
    that the applicant has  behaved  in  such  a  way  that  public  policy
    requires their exclusion.  One can also envisage an extreme case where,
    whether or not the Rules  make  express  provision  for  it,  the  true
    position is such that the very purpose of Article 8 would be  subverted
    by allowing entry.  Such a situation would, in our view,  arise  where,
    in an entry clearance case involving marriage, cogent evidence  emerges
    to show that the applicant has undergone a forced marriage and that  it
    would be contrary to her human rights if she were  to  be  admitted  in
    order to live with her husband in the United Kingdom. In  this  regard,
    it is important to bear in mind the general  purpose  of  Appendix  FM,
    which is to give effect to Article 8 considerations.

37. There is, however, no suggestion whatsoever in the  present  case  that
    any such hypothetical  situation  may  exist.   The  refusal  of  entry
    clearance was entirely due to the respondent's view about the sponsor's
    ability to meet the financial requirements of the Rules  by  virtue  of
    employment. The First-tier Tribunal found that view was  wrongly  held.
    That mistaken view continues to be the sole  ground  for  refusal.   As
    such, the present  case  falls  squarely  within  the  scope  of  cases
    envisaged  in  OA  and  TZ  (Pakistan).   It  would  manifestly  be   a
    disproportionate interference with  the  Article  8  family  life  that
    exists between the appellant and her  husband  for  the  respondent  to
    refuse the appellant entry clearance.

DECISION

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains the making of an  error  on
a point of law.  We set  that  decision  aside  and  substitute  a  decision
allowing the appellant's appeal on Article 8 grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.
