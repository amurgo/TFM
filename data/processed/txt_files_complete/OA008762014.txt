For the Appellant:     No legal representation
For the Respondent:    Mr N Smart (HOPO)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge O R Williams, promulgated on 22nd  September  2014,  following  a
    hearing at Birmingham on 15th September 2014.   In  the  determination,
    the judge allowed the  appeal  of  Kaiser  Ali  Khan.   The  Respondent
    Secretary  of  State  subsequently  applied  for,  and   was   granted,
    permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and thus the  matter  comes
    before me.

 2. The Appellant is a male, a citizen of Pakistan, who  was  born  on  1st
    December 1990.  He appeals against the refusal of  entry  clearance  to
    join his wife, Yasmin Bibi Sabir, a person present and settled  in  the
    UK, the refusal being on account of his failure to meet  the  financial
    requirement test, such as to show a income of least �18,600 per  annum,
    with an additional �2,400  for  each  child,  from  the  Sponsor.   The
    Sponsor  has  five  children  and  has  been  married  previously  (see
    paragraph 13).  There  is  no  issue  as  to  the  genuineness  of  the
    marriage.

The Judge's Findings

 3. The judge observed that "all the children  are  British  citizens"  and
    that the Appellant has parental responsibility for his  late  brother's
    children, "as he is married to the Sponsor" (see paragraph 16).   Since
    the children were British citizens,  they  did  not  have  to  show  an
    additional �2,400 income for each child.   The  judge  dealt  with  the
    reasonableness  of  the  children  relocating  with  their  mother   to
    Pakistan.  He applied Appendix EX.1  (see  paragraphs  12  to  21)  and
    concluded that "there would be insurmountable obstacles to family  life
    with the partner continuing outside the United Kingdom" (paragraph 21).



Grounds of Application

 4. The grounds of application state that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    allowed  the  appeal  under  Appendix  FM  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    However, the Immigration  Act  2014  inserted  a  paragraph  EX.2  into
    Appendix FM which defines  "insurmountable  obstacles"  to  mean  "very
    significant difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their
    partner in continuing their family life together outside the UK".   The
    grounds state that the "judge has failed to direct himself to  the  new
    definition of insurmountable obstacles, and it is submitted that  there
    would not be very significant difficulties which could not be  overcome
    nor would there be very serious hardship".

 5. On 10th December 2014, permission to appeal was granted.

Submissions

 6. At the  hearing  before  me  on  26th  June  2015,  the  Appellant  was
    unrepresented.  His wife, Yasmin Bibi Sabir, was in attendance together
    with Henna Bibi Sabir.  Mr Smart, appearing on behalf of the Respondent
    Secretary of State, submitted that he would apply to  have  the  appeal
    withdrawn.  The reason was that paragraph EX.2 was introduced  only  by
    HS 532 for implementation on 28th June 2014, and at  the  date  of  the
    decision by the Entry Clearance Officer on 17th  December  2013,  these
    new Rules had no application whatsoever.

 7. I have considered Appendix FM, and EX.2, which  reads  that,  "for  the
    purposes of paragraph EX.1.(b), 'insurmountable  obstacles'  means  the
    very significant difficulties which would be faced by the applicant  or
    their partner in continuing their family life together outside  the  UK
    and which could not be overcome or would entail very  serious  hardship
    for the applicant or their partner".  It is clear that this  provision,
    introduced by HC 532, and ordered by the House of Commons to be printed
    on 10th July 2014, had no application at the date of  the  decision  by
    the Entry Clearance Officer, or the date of the decision by the  judge.
    Accordingly, permission to withdraw this appeal is hereby given.  There
    is no effective appeal before me.

 8. Accordingly, there is no material error of law in the original  judge's
    decision.  The appeal is withdrawn,  and  the  decision  of  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge O R Williams stands.  This means  that  entry  clearance
    should forthwith be granted by the post at Islamabad to the  Appellant,
    Mr Qaiser Ali Khan.

 9. This decision is to be sent to the Sponsor's address at 28  Braithwaite
    Road, Sparkbrook, Birmingham, B11  ILA,  and  not  to  the  immigration
    consultants in Islamabad.

10. No anonymity order is made.
