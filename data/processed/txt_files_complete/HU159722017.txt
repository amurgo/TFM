                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellant is a national of Pakistan who made an application for entry
clearance to the UK as the spouse of the sponsor on 19 December 2016. That
application was refused on 12 October 2017.
The Appellant's appeal against that refusal on Article 8 grounds came
before the First-tier Tribunal on the papers, whereupon it was dismissed by
First-tier Tribunal Judge NMK Lawrence in a brief decision promulgated on
16 August 2018.
The Appellant sought to challenge that decision, and her application for
permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted by First tier
Tribunal Judge Kelly on all grounds on 28 December 2018.
Neither party has applied under Rule 15(2A) for further evidence to be
admitted in the remaking of the decision.  Thus the matter comes before me.


Error of law?
The Judge appears to have considered the Appellant had a child [8] and as
such it is common ground that he fell into error over the content of the
evidence before him. It is also common ground that he either misunderstood,
or, mis-directed himself as to the evidence concerning the sponsor's claim
to have held two genuine employments. He did not engage adequately with the
content of the refusal letter. Although this is a very brief decision, the
parties are agreed that it discloses a material error of law. It is agreed
that the Judge failed to adequately engage with the evidence before him, so
that the Appellant was denied a fair hearing of her appeal.
When consideration turned to the nature of the appropriate remedy the
parties noted that this remained an appeal on the papers, and the extensive
delay to which the Appellant has been subject through no fault of her own.
By consent, the decision upon the appeal will be re-made in the Upper
Tribunal upon the evidence filed. There has already been significant delay
in the disposal of the appeal, and neither party was keen for that to be
exacerbated by remittal. In the circumstances I remake the decision upon
the appeal on the evidence filed by the parties for the hearing on 19 July
2018. Neither party has sought to supplement that evidence subsequently.
The evidence is however very limited. There is little of relevance in the
modest bundle filed for the appeal by the Respondent. The Appellant's
unpaginated and unindexed bundle of 11 July 2018 contains no witness
statement or letter from the sponsor or the Appellant.


Decision remade
It is not disputed that the couple are married, and thus I accept that they
enjoy "family life" together, and that the decision under appeal engages
their Article 8(1) rights.
The Respondent has placed in issue whether the application met the
requirements of Appendix FM and FM-SE of the Immigration Rules, concerning
the minimum income threshold. It is disputed that the sponsor was genuinely
engaged in the employments detailed in the application, at the date the
application was made, and that stance is taken as a result of the answers
recorded in the decision letter as having been given by the sponsor to the
ECO when questioned about the employment he was said to hold with "Four
Seasons Food Services (NE) Ltd" ["FS"].
I note that no transcript of any interview between the ECO and the sponsor
has been placed in evidence by the Respondent. On the other hand the
Appellant has never requested one or complained that there has been any
confusion over the answers given by the sponsor to the ECO and recorded in
the decision letter. There is, for example, no evidence from the sponsor to
suggest that his answers have been misunderstood or mis-recorded. I am
satisfied that the decision letter makes it quite clear to the Appellant
why the Respondent took the decision he did, and allowed both herself and
the sponsor to engage with those reasons and offer evidence in response.
The reality is that the Appellant has failed to file evidence from the
sponsor that engages properly with these reasons. In the circumstances I am
satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these questions were asked
of him, and that he was unable to answer them.
Although the heading to the letter dated 3 January 2017 purporting to be
from Ibrar Ahmed as a director of FS, represents this business to be a
limited liability company, the registered number is not given. No details
are given of the company, beyond its trading address and registered
address. Thus there is no evidence to show independently that it is
actively trading, or to help explain the sponsor's inability to answer the
ECO's questions. The letter in question represents the sponsor to hold a
permanent position at an annual wage of ï¿½7,488, but does not explain what
that position is, or what he has to undertake to earn that salary. There is
no letter, or other evidence, from Ibrar Ahmed to explain how the sponsor
could genuinely hold such an employment, and yet have been unable to name
any other employee of the business, his manager, the owner of the business,
or, explain what the nature of FS' business is, where it traded from, what
the exterior of the business premises looked like, or, what his job
entailed. Equally there is no evidence from the sponsor that does so.
I note that the sponsor has produced no evidence from HMRC to show that the
earnings he has claimed to have received from either FS, or Azad Tandoori,
have been declared for tax purposes, and the PAYE and NI deductions said to
have been made in the payslips relied on have been reported to HMRC,
acknowledged by HMRC, or, paid to HMRC
There are in evidence a number of copy documents that have the appearance
of payslips issued to the sponsor in late 2016 and early 2017, which are
identified as having been issued by Azad Tandoori, and record PAYE and NI
deductions. The net figures at the foot, do appear to correspond to counter
credits made to the sponsor's Nat West bank account of cash sums a few days
after the payslip date. Equally, there are in evidence a number of copy
documents that have the appearance of payslips issued to the sponsor in
late 2016 and early 2017, which are identified as having been issued by FS
and record PAYE and NI deductions. The net figures at the foot, also appear
to appear to correspond to counter credits made to the sponsor's Nat West
bank account of cash sums a few days after the payslip date.
Whilst I note that these sums have been credited to the sponsor's bank
account, as recorded in the statements, I am not satisfied that this simple
transfer of funds of itself establishes that both of the claimed
employments are genuine. If both employments were genuine I would expect
the sponsor to be able to identify who owned the businesses he worked for,
who his managers were, and who were his fellow employees in those
businesses. I would expect him to be able to identify what the nature of
their trade was, and, what his own job within the businesses was. I would
expect him to be able to identify the premises at which he discharged his
duties, even if he could not provide the full postal addresses.
In the circumstances I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities
that the Appellant has demonstrated that she met the requirements of the
Immigration Rules when she lodged her application for entry clearance, or,
that she has ever met them subsequently. There is no evidence before me
that would allow me to find that she will never be able to meet them.
The couple must have married in the knowledge that unless the Appellant met
the requirements of the Immigration Rules for entry as the sponsor's spouse
that they would only be able to live together as a married couple in
Pakistan. There is no suggestion the sponsor is unable to visit Pakistan in
safety, or, that he could not settle there with the Appellant. I infer that
their marriage was undertaken in Pakistan.
In the circumstances there is no evidence that would permit me to find that
any special circumstances existed at the date of the application, or that
any special circumstances have been created subsequently, that would mean
the Appellant should be relieved of the obligation to make an application,
paying the requisite fee, that meets the requirements of the Immigration
Rules. It follows that the refusal of entry clearance was a proportionate
response even if there was no enhanced public interest resulting from a
dishonest claim that the sponsor genuinely earned the sums asserted.
However in the light of my findings there is such an enhanced public
interest.
Accordingly I remake the decision on the appeal so as to dismiss it.

Decision

The Decision of the First Tier Tribunal which was promulgated on 16 August
2018 did involve the making of an error of law that requires the decision
to be set aside and remade.
The appeal is dismissed


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008
