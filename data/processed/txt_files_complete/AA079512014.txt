                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a female national of Sri Lanka who was born in 1988.

    Anonymity Order

 2. The basis  of  the  Appellant's  case  is  a  claim  for  international
    protection which involves  trafficking  and  sexual  violence.  She  is
    suffering from significant mental health problems. Having had regard to
    Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008  and  the
    Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of 2013: Anonymity Orders  I  therefore
    consider it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"

    Background to this Appeal


 3. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom in  January  2011  with  entry
    clearance as a Tier 4 (General) Student Migrant. On the  14th  December
    2011 she claimed asylum in Switzerland.  The  Respondent  accepts  that
    what transpired between those dates was that the Appellant was  met  at
    Heathrow by a distant relative, S, who immediately took her by  car  to
    Paris. There he told her that she was going  to  marry  him.  When  she
    refused he imprisoned her.  She  was  tortured,  raped  and  beaten  on
    various occasions over several months.   In  early  December  2011  the
    Appellant was able to escape with the assistance of an aunt  who  lives
    in Paris. This aunt took her in and then after some time to Switzerland
    where she claimed asylum. The  Swiss  authorities  requested  that  the
    United Kingdom accept responsibility for the  claim  under  the  Dublin
    Convention, because this had been her first point of entry  to  Europe.
    For  reasons  that  are  not  entirely  clear,  the   UK   did   accept
    responsibility and the Appellant was  returned  to  London,  where  she
    claimed asylum at port on the 6th September 2012.


 4. The Respondent 's decision was not made until the 7th August 2014.   In
    brief summary the Respondent accepted the conclusions of the  Competent
    Authority that the Appellant had been trafficked as  claimed,  but  the
    Respondent concluded that there was no current risk to her if she  were
    to be returned to Sri Lanka. The claim was refused  and  the  Appellant
    appealed.

 5. The matter came before the First-tier Tribunal  (Judge  Lever)  on  the
    29th September 2015. In a determination dated 5th  October  2015  Judge
    Lever dismissed the appeal on all grounds.

 6. Permission was granted to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  the  4th
    November 2015.  In a written decision promulgated on the 6th July  2016
    (appended) I found that the decision of Judge Lever contained errors of
    law such that it should be set aside in its entirety.    I  found  that
    the Tribunal had failed to have regard to the totality of  the  medical
    evidence and had erred in making  unclear  findings  about  whether  it
    accepted the conclusions of the Competent Authority. An allegation that
    the Appellant had not had a fair hearing was rejected.

 7. At the resumed hearing I heard submissions and had  regard  to  further
    documentary  evidence  produced,  particularly   in   regard   to   the
    Appellant's mental health. The parties agreed  that  in  re-making  the
    decision I must broadly address three matters:

              i) The political asylum claim


                 The Appellant asserts that she has a well-founded  fear  of
                 persecution upon return to Sri Lanka  for  reasons  of  her
                 imputed political opinion. She claims that in 2010 she  was
                 arrested  and  ill-treated  for  her  involvement  in   the
                 production of Tamil separatist literature. She was released
                 upon payment of a bribe. She now fears that as  a  returnee
                 from London, with that record, she will be perceived to  be
                 an activist committed to the  destruction  of  the  unitary
                 state of Sri Lanka, and face persecution as a result.


             ii) The trafficking claim


                 The Appellant fears that the authorities in Sri Lanka would
                 be unwilling or unable to protect her from S who  would  be
                 readily able to find her (through family connections).


            iii) The mental health claim


                 As a result of her experiences the Appellant  is  suffering
                 from serious mental health  problems.  Notwithstanding  her
                 long term engagement with services in this country she  has
                 made several attempts to end her own life and  there  is  a
                 real risk that she would succeed in doing so were she to be
                 faced with removal to Sri Lanka.

 8. Before me the  parties  agreed  that  to  some  extent  each  of  these
    apparently discrete limbs  are  interlinked.    For  instance,  if  the
    Appellant were to be subject to  a  short  period  of  questioning  and
    detention on arrival in Sri  Lanka  her   history  of  trafficking  and
    consequent mental health problems might elevate that  relatively  minor
    infringement of  her  liberty  to  the  threshold  of  "serious  harm".
    Conversely her claimed history of involvement with the  Tamil  movement
    might give rise to such anxiety upon return to Sri Lanka that it  would
    tip her already fragile mental health to a  point  where  the  risk  of
    suicide would be increased. I therefore approach the evidence  'in  the
    round' whilst mindful that the claim has distinct elements to it.


 9. There is much agreement on the facts. The Respondent accepts  that  the
    Appellant was trafficked and that she endured  the  very  serious  harm
    that such an experience will very often entail.  It  is  accepted  that
    she suffers from serious mental health problems.   It is accepted  that
    she is a Tamil from Sri Lanka. The central matter in issue  is  whether
    each or  any  of  those  matters  give  rise  to  a  current  need  for
    protection.


    The Appellant's Evidence


10. The Appellant's evidence is set out in her  screening  interview  dated
    the 6th September 2012, her substantive  asylum  interview  dated  17th
    September 2012, the Competent  Authority  'conclusive  grounds'  report
    dated 5th December 2014, and her witness statements dated 11th November
    2014 and 10th February 2015. I have also gleaned some information  from
    the letters of Trish Doocey, who was for a long  time  the  Appellant's
    counsellor in the UK, a role latterly performed by Ali Golding, who has
    also written a number of letters.


    Sri Lanka

11. In 2006 the Appellant was an 18 year-old Tamil living in  Jaffna.   She
    was studying for her 'A' levels in commerce, economics and  accounting.
    On her way to her tutorials in Maniday she would be stopped on the road
    by people that she knew to  be  with  the  LTTE.  They  would  ask  the
    Appellant and other students for donations and food. She would give  it
    to them. She was not a member of the organisation herself, nor were her
    brothers since they had refused to join. Other members  of  her  family
    were however, and the Appellant supported them  by  making  such  small
    donations.  They were fighting for her community.


12. The Appellant completed her 'A' levels  in  the  summer  of  2006.  She
    enrolled at a computer college. After completion of a two month  course
    they offered her a job. She was a  cashier  and  also  taught  children
    basic computing.   During this time the Appellant was  living  at  home
    with her parents. Her female cousin used to visit.  She  was  with  the
    LTTE.  The Appellant continued to try and help raise  funds  for  them.
    She would use the facilities at the computer centre to  print  t-shirts
    and leaflets.   She would print batches of 200 leaflets when  the  boss
    was not there. She did that about 3 or 4 times.   She would  then  pass
    the materials on to the person who organised locally. She does not know
    how they were distributed.

13. On the 30th August 2010 the Appellant was still working at the computer
    centre.   The army and police showed up and went to see the Director of
    the College.   They showed him a picture of  the  Appellant  and  asked
    where she was.   She now knows  that  they  had  already  been  to  her
    parents' home to ask questions about her. They had taken the photograph
    from there.  The Director confirmed that she  was  there  and  she  was
    arrested.

14. The Appellant was taken to Chunnakam police station.  They put her in a
    cell. She was held  there  for  7  days,  during  which  time  she  was
    subjected to serious ill-treatment. She was beaten with  sticks  and  a
    belt and abused her. The Appellant described in  her  asylum  interview
    how they "tried to sexually abuse" her. Later in the asylum process she
    disclosed to her counsellor Trish Doocey that in fact one  officer  had
    raped her.   They never told the Appellant why she had  been  arrested,
    or asked her any questions. She knew why, though.  When she  was  being
    taken away from the computer centre one of the officers was holding the
    leaflets that she had produced.  Whilst the Appellant was in  detention
    her mother was trying to secure  her  release.  After  seven  days  she
    managed to persuade someone in the station  to  accept  a  bribe.   The
    family paid 10 lakhs.  The Appellant was released and told that she was
    to report every week to that police station.

15. The  Appellant  did  not  report  as  arranged.  Her  family  sent  her
    immediately to Colombo where they secured the services of an agent  who
    helped the Appellant apply for a UK Tier 4 visa.   When she missed  the
    first reporting appointment the police came to  the  family  home.  Her
    mother told them that she had disappeared and that  she  did  not  know
    where she had gone. The officers told her mother that if the  Appellant
    did not report  her  brothers  would  start  to  "face  problems".  The
    Appellant's brothers therefore left  the  family  home  and  went  into
    hiding.

16. Meanwhile in Colombo the Appellant had successfully applied for a place
    at Westminster College in London. It was a four-year course that  would
    have led to a degree. The visa was issued on the 5th January  2011  and
    the Appellant left for the UK.

17. The Appellant has been in touch with  her  family  in  Sri  Lanka.  She
    speaks to her mother about twice per month.   She said that the  police
    have asked about where she is.  The family now believe that the  police
    interest in the Appellant may be linked to her female cousin who was  a
    member of the Tigers. They recall that in 2009 the army had come to the
    house and questioned the Appellant. They had told her she was going  to
    tell them where the camps were.  They thought she was this cousin. When
    the Appellant and her parents had managed to persuade  them  that  they
    had got the wrong girl they had gone away.

    Trafficking


18. The Appellant was expecting to be met at the airport in  the  UK  by  a
    cousin who lived in London with his family.   When she came through the
    arrivals lounge and out in into the airport he was not  there.  Instead
    she was met by another distant relative, the man named S.   This man is
    related to the Appellant on her mother's side. Although she had not met
    him before she knew who he was because she had been  shown  photographs
    of him in Sri Lanka.   Her mother had wanted to arrange her marriage to
    him. He lived in France. The Appellant had told  her  mother  that  she
    didn't want to get married yet and that was  the  end  of  that.   Then
    there he was at the airport in London.


19. S told the Appellant that her cousin was working so he had been sent to
    get her instead. She went with him and got in his car.  They drove  for
    some time and went on a boat. The language  was  different  where  they
    went. The Appellant now understands that he drove her to France.  After
    they reached the house that they were staying in the man told her  that
    he wanted to marry her. The Appellant said that she  did  not  want  to
    marry, and that she had come to study. When she said that he beat  her.
    He hit her with a chain that he subsequently used to lock the door.  He
    injured her arm and hit her about the head.

20. For six months the Appellant was held by S. she was not allowed out  at
    any time. There was an elderly couple who  lived  downstairs  and  they
    would go out and get food for them. S did not go out either. The couple
    told the Appellant that he could not leave that house  because  he  was
    wanted for murder and the police would  get  him.   This  couple  would
    prepare the meals as well.

21. S insisted that she would stay there until she agreed to marry him.  He
    repeatedly assaulted her. He kept guns in the  house.  He  would  drink
    heavily and then beat her. He would taunt her and  blow  smoke  in  her
    face. He caused a head injury to her by pulling her legs out from under
    her so she fell backwards and smashed her head. She subsequently  found
    out that  she  had  fractured  her  skull.     The  Appellant  did  not
    initially allege  that  she  had  been  sexually  abused.  However  she
    subsequently disclosed to her counsellor and other mental  health  care
    professionals that he had in fact raped her on a number of occasions.

22. After 6 months S did go out one day. The Appellant persuaded the couple
    to allow her to make a phone call. She had in her luggage a small diary
    that had her relatives' addresses and telephone numbers in it. She  had
    kept it hidden from S. She phoned  an  aunt  whom  she  knew  lived  in
    France. She asked the couple to talk to her aunt  on  the  phone.  They
    told her where she was and her uncle came to get her. He  took  her  to
    his home.  This was in approximately June or July 2011.

23. The Appellant was at her aunt's house the next  day  when  S  appeared.
    They saw him outside and he must have seen them at the  window  because
    he came to the door and broke the glass in it. They managed to keep him
    out and he went away. Although the Appellant had taken her bag with her
    she had left the small diary and she surmises that S had  gone  through
    it, seen the aunt's address and worked out where she was.  Her aunt and
    uncle moved her to another relative's house. The Appellant took a small
    overnight bag with her and left her luggage at their house.  Whilst she
    was staying with this other person S came back to her aunts  and  broke
    in. He took her luggage away with  him,  including  her  documents  and
    passport.   The Appellant's aunt and uncle telephoned  the  police  and
    reported everything that S had done, including  having  imprisoned  the
    Appellant.   The police came and interviewed the aunt and  uncle.  They
    told them that S was already wanted for other matters.

24. The Appellant's aunt was afraid that if she remained in France, S would
    find her. They took her  over  the  border  to  Switzerland  where  she
    claimed asylum.  They had some relatives there with whom she could stay
    but the Swiss authorities put her in an asylum centre.  She  was  there
    until she was sent back to the UK.  Her relatives in  France  continued
    to be harassed by S until he was detained and imprisoned by the  French
    authorities.  Now that he has been released he has been back  in  touch
    asking questions about where the Appellant is.

25.  When interviewed the Appellant submitted a report she was given by the
    French authorities. The Competent Authority assessed her claims  to  be
    credible on a balance of probabilities.

    Mental Health


26. The evidence relating to the Appellant's mental health is extensive.  I
    have summarised it as best I can in chronological order.


27. The earliest evidence is dated 20th May 2014. It is a letter from Trish
    Doocey of 'Spinning World Psychological  Services'.  Ms  Doocey  is  an
    accredited member  of  the  British  Association  for  Counselling  and
    Psychotherapy.  She confirms that the Appellant was referred  there  in
    2012 by the Homeless  and  Vulnerable  Persons  Team.  Her  notes  show
    consistent recording of flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety  and  inability
    to concentrate. The Appellant's mental state  became  more  fragile  in
    October 2013 after her MP was unable to shed any light on the  progress
    of her asylum case. She was frequently self-harming,  became  withdrawn
    and was classified as suicidal. She was  being  provided  with  therapy
    tools to help her cope with traumatic flashbacks.

28. In October 2014 Ms Doocey issued a brief statement to report  that  the
    Appellant had disclosed incidents of rape  during  her  confinement  in
    France which she had not previously mentioned. She also  revealed  that
    she had been raped by a police officer during a detention in Sri  Lanka
    in August 2010. Although the Appellant was able to give a certain level
    of detail, there would come a point  where  she  was  unable  to  speak
    further and became too tearful to carry on.

29. On the 2nd December 2014 Ms Doocey provided an updated report. It opens
    "since my report  of 20th May 2014  this  client's  mental  health  has
    declined". The Appellant's self-harming  had  increased  in  frequency,
    with her  reporting  to  support  workers  that  helped  her  "to  feel
    something clearly when her feelings are numbed and she feels in  danger
    of  losing  her  mind".   In  November  2014  the  Appellant  underwent
    assessment for a revised psychological  measure.  Her  results  on  the
    'Impact of Event Scale -  revised'  were  64  out  of  a  possible  88,
    constituting a high score and twice the baseline for a PTSD  diagnosis.
    The mental health team reported to Ms Doocey  that  the  Appellant  was
    taking high dosages of strong medication for mood and sleep  disorders.
    Her various psychological symptoms were exacerbated by physical  health
    complaints including  an  inability  to  keep  food  down.   Ms  Doocey
    acknowledged that she did not have the clinical qualifications to  make
    her own diagnosis of PTSD  but  stated  that  she  believed  her  close
    contact with the Appellant over a two year period (90+ meetings) to  be
    valuable in the assessment of credibility, as  well  as  causation.  Ms
    Doocey reports that the Appellant has been, apart  from  one  important
    proviso, entirely consistent in her recounting of her personal  history
    across all of those consultations.  In her experience it  is  difficult
    to fabricate a mental illness: to do so would  be  extremely  difficult
    across time and symptom  clusters.  The  information  available  to  Ms
    Doocey has not been collected during "question  and  answer"  sessions,
    but during extended consultations where the Appellant was able to speak
    freely about what is disturbing her.


30. Ms Doocey states that the only inconsistency that  has  emerged  during
    her various sessions with the Appellant is in  relation  to  rape.  The
    Appellant was at first not willing to discuss any sexual  violence  she
    suffered. As she got to know Ms Doocey and learned to  trust  her,  she
    was able to disclose. Ms Doocey found that  behaviour  to  be  entirely
    consistent with known patterns of behaviour  for  survivors  of  sexual
    assault who internalise the "shame" that they feel. In the case of  the
    Appellant that was exacerbated by cultural factors: in Sri  Lanka  rape
    victims do not speak out for fear of being blamed and ostracised.


31. In February 2015 the Appellant was assessed by Consultant  Psychiatrist
    Dr Venkat Chetan Reddy Majjiga of the  5  Boroughs  NHS  Foundation  in
    Wigan.  Dr Majjiga's report is dated the 12th March 2015.   He  records
    that she first  came  into  contact  with  mental  health  services  in
    December 2013. The assessment made in January 2014  was  that  she  had
    Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with depression.  Her psychiatric  notes
    show that she had intermittent contact from mental health services from
    that time, and that she  had  been  receiving  support  from  'Spinning
    World' Psychological Services for approximately  two  years.   She  was
    being prescribed Quetiapine, Mirtazapine and Zopiclone.   The Appellant
    reported to Dr Majjiga the following symptoms: nightmares,  flashbacks,
    anxiety and distress. She reported utilising self-harm as  a  means  of
    controlling anxiety.  Applying the diagnostic  criteria  in  ICD.10  Dr
    Majjiga diagnosed the Appellant with PTSD and Acute Stress Reaction. He
    believed that her self-harm was a means to cope  with  distress  rather
    than attempts to end her own life.  He noted the earlier  diagnosis  of
    depression but found it to be  well  controlled  at  the  date  of  his
    consultation.


32. I have a brief letter dated 15th July 2016 from Ali Golding, a Recovery
    & Crisis Service Manager at 'Haven House' Wellbeing Centre who confirms
    that the Appellant was referred there by  Bridgewater  NHS  Service  in
    April 2015. The service found her emotional wellbeing to be  poor.  She
    has a diagnosis of depression and anxiety and requires  trauma  therapy
    to deal with rape, sexual assault and  torture  issues.  She  has  been
    attending weekly and has had difficulty engaging  with  her  therapist.
    She regards "suicide as her only option".


33. There is a letter dated  27th  July  2016  from  Bridgewater  Community
    Healthcare which confirms that the Appellant has been registered  there
    since October 2012. Their records show that she  has  twice  taken  too
    much prescription medication and has been taken via ambulance to  Wigan
    Infirmary. Although she was discharged from the service in May 2015 she
    has re-presented on a number of occasions  with  depression,  self-harm
    and other mental health issues.  They  have  signposted  her  to  other
    services.

34. Shortly before the hearing the Appellant's  representatives  filed  and
    served a further letter from Ali Golding dated  30th  August  2016.  Ms
    Golding writes that  to  her  knowledge  the  Appellant  has  attempted
    suicide on two occasions by taking overdoses and that her mental health
    has deteriorated in recent months.  She  is  not  managing  her  mental
    health well and is reliant upon the service. She has poor  diet,  sleep
    and is socially isolated. The week before the letter  was  written  the
    Appellant self-harmed by burning her arm, which she reported  doing  in
    order to cope with anxiety.  Ms Golding writes:

         "I believe that if she gets a negative decision from the UK  Border
         Agency/Tribunal there is a very strong indication from her that she
         would make a serious attempt to take her own life. I asked  if  she
         had formulated a plan and she stated she had, she  would  run  into
         oncoming traffic so as her ending would be quick and hopefully  she
         would not feel much pain...


         ...I have worked weekly with this client  and  I  have  built  some
         trust up with her to the point she is now disclosing  sexual  abuse
         and torture that she has experienced in the past. These issues  add
         to the complexity of this client's problems and her emotional state
         is not balanced. She is unable to manage  her  depression,  anxiety
         and suicidal ideation despite being prescribed:


         Amitriptyline 10mg x 2 daily


         Mitrazapine 45mg daily


         Quetiapine 100mg daily


         Quetiapine 25mg x 2 daily


         She is of a  nervous  disposition  and  is  clearly  desperate  for
         support.


         There is a sense of hopelessness and I feel this  is  why  she  has
         formulated a suicide plan, if negative news is received  about  the
         decision to allow her to stay in this country, I  do  believe  that
         she is capable of putting her suicide plan into account  and  could
         make a serious attempt to take her own life.


         She continues to attend her weekly appointments with myself and she
         attempts to motivate herself to think positively. In the six months
         that I have worked with [the Appellant] , she has never  failed  to
         attend, she has engaged with the service and she has  just  started
         to trust the process. If the decision is a positive one and she  is
         allowed to stay in this country, [the Appellant] has  requested  to
         continue to work intensively with Haven  House  in  order  to  make
         progress, manage her mental health, improve her emotional wellbeing
         and address historic abuse issues.


         She has very little contact with her family  in  her  home  country
         through fear of reprisal from people who she believes want to  find
         her and hurt her. She recently informed me that the male individual
         who held her against her will for several months in France in  2011
         and repeatedly raped and tortured her was now out  of  prison.  She
         had been told by her mother that  her  aunty  in  France  had  been
         contacted by the male and he had asked her  where  [the  Appellant]
         was as he wanted to find her. [The Appellant]  was  fearful  and  I
         asked if she wanted to inform Greater Manchester Police, she stated
         yes. I was  present  while  the  police  officer  interviewed  [the
         Appellant]. He stated that her fears and concerns had  been  logged
         and she needed to stay vigilant  but  it  would  be  doubtful  this
         individual could ever trace her as nobody,  including  her  family,
         know where in the UK she lives"

35. The most recent evidence I had was a letter dated  5th  September  2016
    from Margaret Sanders, a Community Link Worker with the Health Outreach
    and Inclusion Service at Bridgewater Community Healthcare.  Ms  Sanders
    writes that on the 25th August 2016  the  Appellant  had  attended  the
    clinic for burns to her arm. She revealed that  she  had  caused  these
    injuries herself and that she did not want to be alive. Ms Sanders took
    the Appellant to be assessed by a Psychiatric Nurse who had a long talk
    with the Appellant. The Appellant said that her suicidal thoughts  were
    motivated by a desire for peace. Eventually she was permitted to return
    home having reassured clinical staff that she would not  self-harm.  On
    the 30th August 2016 Ms Sanders visited her at home to  check  on  her.
    She found that the Appellant had taken an overdose of her  prescription
    medication. She called an ambulance and the appellant was  admitted  to
    Royal Albert Edward Infirmary.   When she was discharged staff took all
    her medication away from her and is now on  a  weekly  prescription  to
    prevent further incidents of harm.   Ms Sanders  states  that  she  has
    been involved in the Appellant's care for four years. She believes that
    her mental and physical health has deteriorated over time.  Ms  Sanders
    concludes with the following brief chronology of preceding events:

        . 4.12.13 overdose - referred to mental health assessment team


        . 17.12.13 self harm - burning with hot spoon - referred to  mental
          health assessment team


        . 20.2.14 she asked GP to give her injection  to  end  her  life  -
          emergency referral to Mental Health via the GP


        . 24.6.14 taken to hospital, crying dizzy headache


        . 26.5.15 self harm - burning, taken too many tablets


        .  12.10.15  overdose,  ambulance  called  and  admitted  to  Leigh
          Infirmary Mental Health Ward


        . 27.4.16 overdose - taken to hospital via ambulance

36. The evidence of Ms Sanders was supported by a note in the  Home  Office
    file which indicated that a SERCO  officer  who  was  checking  on  the
    Appellant found her to have taken an overdose and that  she  was  being
    admitted to hospital. Although the electronic minute on the Home Office
    records showed that event to have taken place on the 2nd September, the
    parties agreed that it was the same overdose referred to by Ms Sanders.
     The later date is possibly the date that  it  was  logged  on  to  the
    system.

    Country Background Material


37. The extant country guidance on Sri Lanka is GJ and  others  (post-civil
    war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 319 (IAC). The headnote reads:

         (1) This determination replaces all existing  country  guidance  on
         Sri Lanka.


         (2) The focus of the Sri Lankan government's  concern  has  changed
         since the civil war ended in May 2009. The LTTE in Sri Lanka itself
         is a spent force and there have been no terrorist  incidents  since
         the end of the civil war.


         (3)  The  government's  present  objective  is  to  identify  Tamil
         activists in the diaspora who are working for Tamil separatism  and
         to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state enshrined in  Amendment
         6(1) to the Sri Lankan Constitution in 1983,  which  prohibits  the
         'violation of territorial integrity' of Sri Lanka. Its focus is  on
         preventing both (a) the resurgence of the LTTE or any similar Tamil
         separatist organisation and (b) the revival of the civil war within
         Sri Lanka.


         (4) If a person is detained by the  Sri  Lankan  security  services
         there remains a  real  risk  of  ill-treatment  or  harm  requiring
         international protection.


         (5) Internal relocation is not an option within  Sri  Lanka  for  a
         person at real risk from the  Sri  Lankan  authorities,  since  the
         government now controls the whole  of  Sri  Lanka  and  Tamils  are
         required to return to a named address  after  passing  through  the
         airport.


         (6) There are no detention facilities at the  airport.  Only  those
         whose names appear on a "stop"  list  will  be  detained  from  the
         airport. Any risk for those in whom the Sri Lankan authorities  are
         or become interested exists not at the airport, but  after  arrival
         in their home area, where their arrival will be verified by the CID
         or police within a few days.


         (7) The current categories of persons at real risk  of  persecution
         or serious harm on return to Sri Lanka,  whether  in  detention  or
         otherwise, are:


             (a) Individuals who are, or are perceived to be, a  threat  to
             the integrity of Sri Lanka as a single state because they are,
             or are perceived to have a significant  role  in  relation  to
             post-conflict Tamil separatism within the  diaspora  and/or  a
             renewal of hostilities within Sri Lanka.


             (b) Journalists (whether in print or  other  media)  or  human
             rights activists, who, in either case, have criticised the Sri
             Lankan government, in particular its human rights  record,  or
             who are associated  with  publications  critical  of  the  Sri
             Lankan government.


             (c) Individuals who have given evidence to the Lessons Learned
             and  Reconciliation  Commission  implicating  the  Sri  Lankan
             security forces, armed forces or the Sri Lankan authorities in
             alleged war crimes. Among those who  may  have  witnessed  war
             crimes during the conflict, particularly in the No-Fire  Zones
             in May 2009, only those who have already identified themselves
             by giving such evidence would  be  known  to  the  Sri  Lankan
             authorities and therefore  only  they  are  at  real  risk  of
             adverse attention or persecution on  return  as  potential  or
             actual war crimes witnesses.


             (d) A person whose name appears on a computerised "stop"  list
             accessible at the airport, comprising a list of those  against
             whom there  is  an  extant  court  order  or  arrest  warrant.
             Individuals whose name  appears  on  a  "stop"  list  will  be
             stopped at the airport and handed over to the appropriate  Sri
             Lankan authorities, in pursuance of such order or warrant.


         (8) The Sri Lankan authorities' approach is based on  sophisticated
         intelligence, both as to activities within Sri  Lanka  and  in  the
         diaspora. The Sri Lankan authorities  know  that  many  Sri  Lankan
         Tamils travelled abroad as economic migrants and also that everyone
         in the Northern Province had some level  of  involvement  with  the
         LTTE  during  the  civil  war.  In  post-conflict  Sri  Lanka,   an
         individual's past history will be relevant only to the extent  that
         it is perceived by the  Sri  Lankan  authorities  as  indicating  a
         present risk to the unitary Sri Lankan  state  or  the  Sri  Lankan
         Government.


         (9)  The  authorities  maintain  a  computerised   intelligence-led
         "watch" list. A person whose name appears on a "watch" list is  not
         reasonably likely to  be  detained  at  the  airport  but  will  be
         monitored by the security services after his or her return. If that
         monitoring does not indicate that such a person is a Tamil activist
         working to destabilise the unitary Sri Lankan state or  revive  the
         internal armed conflict, the individual  in  question  is  not,  in
         general, reasonably likely to be detained by the  security  forces.
         That will be a question of fact in  each  case,  dependent  on  any
         diaspora activities carried out by such an individual.


         (10) Consideration must always be given to whether, in the light of
         an individual's activities and responsibilities  during  the  civil
         war, the exclusion clauses are engaged (Article 1F of  the  Refugee
         Convention and  Article  12(2)  of  the  Qualification  Directive).
         Regard should be had to the categories for exclusion set out in the
         "Eligibility Guidelines For Assessing the International  Protection
         Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka", published by UNHCR  on  21
         December 2012.

38. It has now been three and half  years  since  the  Tribunal  heard  the
    appeals in GJ & Ors. The Respondent has recently issued an up  to  date
    report  on  conditions  in  Sri  Lanka  in  the  form  of  the  Country
    Information and Guidance  report  Sri  Lanka:   Tamil  Separatism  v3.0
    August 2016 ('the CIG'). The CIG acknowledges further  improvements  as
    well as continuing problems:

         2.3.6 Since the country guidance case of GJ  &  Others  was  handed
         down in 2013,  a  new  government,  led  by  President  Maithripala
         Sirisena came to office in January 2015, following which there have
         been some positive developments in Sri Lanka, such as  the  element
         of fear that has considerably diminished in Colombo and the  South,
         and the restoration of  the  legitimacy  and  independence  of  Sri
         Lanka's Human Rights Commission.


         2.3.7 The 'white van' abductions that operated outside all norms of
         law and order are  now  seldom  reported.  The  number  of  torture
         complaints has reduced but new cases of Tamil victims  continue  to
         emerge and police reportedly often continue to resort  to  violence
         and excessive force.


         2.3.8 Authorities reportedly monitor  the  personal  communications
         and  activities  of  individuals  known  to  be  critical  of   the
         government, particularly in the  Tamil-populated  north  and  east.
         Persons perceived to  sympathise  with  the  LTTE  continue  to  be
         intimidated, harassed, arrested, detained and tortured. Tamil women
         in Northern Sri Lanka still face the risk of rape and harassment by
         the security forces present throughout  the  region.  Organisations
         and persons previously proscribed under  anti-terrorism  laws  have
         been de-proscribed  as  the  new  government  has  sought  to  more
         accurately reflect the threat to Sri Lanka from groups and  persons
         associated with terrorism.

39. The CIG contains a section dealing  specifically  with  evidence  about
    treatment of Tamil returnees:

         6.5.1  The  Society  for  Threatened  Peoples,  Written  statement*
         submitted by the Society for Threatened Peoples, a non-governmental
         organization in special consultative status to the UN Human  rights
         council, Ongoing oppression of minorities in Sri Lanka, 4 September
         2015, stated that: 'Returning Tamils  from  abroad  continue  being
         arrested at the airport. The surveillance of the civil  society  in
         the North and East is remaining high.


         6.5.2 The Immigration and  Refugee  Board  of  Canada  reported  in
         February 2015 that: 'Sources report that individuals returning from
         abroad  are  particularly  subject  to  screening.'  A  July   2015
         International Truth & Justice Project (ITJP) Sri  Lanka  report  on
         Sri Lanka's Survivors of  Torture  and  Sexual  Violence  2009-2015
         stated  that:  'A  security  force  insider  testified  since   the
         presidential election in 2015 that military intelligence  officials
         from Joseph Camp were actively looking  for  any  Tamils  returning
         home from abroad in order to interrogate them. The  witness  stated
         that the intention was to abduct, detain and torture them.'

    This section concludes with several references to individual  cases  of
    returnees being detained and ill-treated.


40. The Appellant's bundle contains a number of human rights  reports  from
    2014 and 2015 which I need not set out in detail,  given  the  material
    cited in the CIG. For instance, the evidence offered in the 2014 report
    by the Human Rights Law Centre (Australia) entitled 'Torture, rape  and
    ill-treatment suffered by  Sri  Lankans  who  return  home'  makes  two
    central points, both picked up the CIG: the authorities are  monitoring
    returnees with care, and cases of extreme human rights  abuses  against
    perceived LTTE members persist.


41. In respect of mental health provision in Sri Lanka the  author  of  the
    refusal letter finds the country  background  material  to  indicate  a
    "substantial public health program in Sri Lanka' [at 76].   The  letter
    cites  evidence  to  the  effect  that  anti-depressant  medication  is
    available, there is one psychologist in the country who  works  at  the
    university in Colombo and there are 55 psychiatrists nationwide.


    Legal Framework


42. In any protection claim the burden of proof lies on the  Appellant  who
    must establish her case to the  standard  of  'reasonable  likelihood'.
    That is a lower standard than would normally  be  applied  in  a  civil
    matter.  In order to qualify for asylum the  Appellant  would  need  to
    establish that she has a well-founded fear of persecution  for  one  of
    the reasons set out in the Refugee Convention. In this case that  would
    be either political opinion and/or membership of  a  particular  social
    group.  Persecution can be defined as 'serious  harm  +  a  failure  of
    state protection'.  Whether harm is 'serious' must be assessed in light
    of the individual characteristics of the person concerned.  In order to
    qualify for international protection on Article 3 or  refugee  grounds,
    the Appellant must establish that there is no  part  of  Sri  Lanka  to
    which she could safely or reasonably be expected to return. If her fear
    only relates to one part of the country  she  must  establish  that  it
    would be unduly harsh to expect her to go and live  somewhere  else  in
    order to avoid that harm.


    Article 3


43. The Appellant relies on Article 3 ECHR in respect of her health. It  is
    submitted on her behalf that she cannot be removed from the UK  because
    the risk of her committing  suicide  would  be  too  great.  The  legal
    framework for consideration of that claim is set out in  the  decisions
    of the Court of  Appeal  in  J  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2005] EWCA Civ 629 and Y and Z (Sri Lanka) v  Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA  Civ  362.   In  J  Dyson  LJ
    analysed the jurisprudence on Article 3 and ill health and formulated a
    six stage test to be applied in such removal cases:

      1. First, the test requires an assessment to be made of  the  severity
         of the treatment which it is said that the applicant  would  suffer
         if removed. This must attain a minimum level of severity. The court
         has said on a number  of  occasions  that  the  assessment  of  its
         severity depends on all the circumstances of the case. But the ill-
         treatment must "necessarily be serious" such that it is "an affront
         to fundamental humanitarian principles to remove an individual to a
         country where he is at risk of serious  ill-treatment":  see  Ullah
         paras [38-39].


      1. Secondly, a causal link must be shown to exist between the  act  or
         threatened act of removal or expulsion and  the  inhuman  treatment
         relied on as violating the applicant's article 3  rights.  Thus  in
         Soering at para [91], the court said:


         "In so far as any liability under  the  Convention  is  or  may  be
         incurred, it is liability incurred by the  extraditing  Contracting
         State by reason of its having taken action which has  as  a  direct
         consequence the  exposure  of  an  individual  to  proscribed  ill-
         treatment."(emphasis added).


         See also para [108] of Vilvarajah where the  court  said  that  the
         examination of the article 3 issue "must focus on  the  foreseeable
         consequences of the removal of the applicants to Sri Lanka..."


      1. Thirdly, in the context of a foreign case, the article 3  threshold
         is particularly high simply because it is a foreign case. And it is
         even higher where the alleged inhuman treatment is not  the  direct
         or  indirect  responsibility  of  the  public  authorities  of  the
         receiving state, but results from some naturally occurring illness,
         whether physical or mental. This is made clear in para  [49]  of  D
         and para [40] of Bensaid.


      1. Fourthly, an article 3 claim can in principle succeed in a  suicide
         case (para [37] of Bensaid).


      1. Fifthly, in deciding whether there is a real risk of  a  breach  of
         article 3 in a suicide case, a question of  importance  is  whether
         the applicant's fear of ill-treatment in the receiving  state  upon
         which the risk of suicide is said to be based is objectively  well-
         founded. If the fear is not well-founded, that will tend  to  weigh
         against there being a real risk that the removal will be in  breach
         of article 3.


      2. Sixthly, a further question of considerable  relevance  is  whether
         the removing and/or the receiving state has effective mechanisms to
         reduce the risk of suicide. If there are effective mechanisms, that
         too will weigh heavily against an applicant's  claim  that  removal
         will violate his or her article 3 rights.

44. That fifth element  of  the  test  caused  some  consternation  amongst
    decision makers. If the fear  of  ill-treatment  was  objectively  well
    founded then one did not need to look to the health issue at all, since
    the claimant  would  succeed  on  asylum  or  free-standing  Article  3
    grounds. This conundrum was then helpfully elucidated by Sedley J in  Y
    & Z. Y and Z were a brother  and  sister  who  had  suffered  atrocious
    persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan state, as had other  members
    of their family.  They both suffered from severe trauma related  mental
    health problems. Their situation had been made worse by the  fact  that
    50 members of  their  family  had  been  killed  in  the  tsunami.   In
    assessing their linked Article 3 health claim Sedley J said this  about
    the fifth test in J:

         [at  paragraph  6]  "notwithstanding  the  emphasis  in  the  fifth
         proposition in J on the fear being well-founded, a fear of  renewed
         torture and sexual abuse may sometimes be just  as  real,  and  its
         potential consequences just as grave, when there  is  no  longer  a
         foundation for it.


         ...


         [at 15] The corollary of the final sentence of �30 of J is that  in
         the  absence  of  an  objective  foundation  for  the   fear   some
         independent basis for it must be established if  weight  is  to  be
         given to it. Such an independent basis may lie in trauma  inflicted
         in the past on the appellant in (or, as  here,  by)  the  receiving
         state: someone who has been  tortured  and  raped  by  his  or  her
         captors may be  terrified  of  returning  to  the  place  where  it
         happened,  especially  if  the  same  authorities  are  in  charge,
         notwithstanding that the objective risk of recurrence has gone.


         [at 16]  One can accordingly add to the fifth principle in J that
         what may nevertheless be of equal importance is whether any genuine
         fear which the appellant may establish, albeit without an objective
         foundation, is such as to create a risk of suicide if there is an
         enforced return".

    Article 8


45. It is submitted on the Appellant's behalf that her removal would  be  a
    disproportionate breach of her Article 8  right  to  private  life.  In
    assessing that matter I must first look  to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  It is only if  the  facts  of  this  case  are  not
    addressed by that provision that I can look to Article 8 outside of the
    Rules.   In  order  to  succeed  on  this  ground  she  would  have  to
    demonstrate that she had established a private life in the UK and  that
    her removal would be an interference with  it.  It  would  be  for  the
    Respondent to show  that  the  Appellant's  removal  was  necessary  in
    pursuit of one of the aims set out in Article 8(2). The maintenance  of
    immigration control does not  feature  in  Article  8  (2)  but  it  is
    accepted on the Appellant's behalf that removal of persons who  do  not
    qualify for leave to remain is a matter  rationally  connected  to  the
    legitimate aim of protecting the economy.  Finally it would be for  the
    Respondent  to  demonstrate  that  the  decision   is,   in   all   the
    circumstances,  proportionate.    In  making  that  assessment  I  must
    balance the  Appellant's  asserted  rights  against  the  wider  public
    interest, and in doing so must have regard to s117B of the Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (as amended).


    My Findings

    Article 3


46. I begin with Article 3 simply because events in  the  days  before  the
    hearing made it the focus of Mr Nicholson's submissions.


47. I have no reason to doubt any of the diagnosis or medical evidence that
    has been put before me.  I accept and find as fact that  the  Appellant
    is severely traumatised and that she has spent the best  part  of  four
    years in counselling in the UK. She has been diagnosed with PTSD, Acute
    Stress Reaction and Depression and  has  had  numerous  and  continuous
    engagements with mental health services.   We  know  from  her  medical
    records that she has made four attempts on her life in recent years: on
    the 4th December 2013, 12th October 2015, 27th  April  2016,  and  31st
    August 2016.   There have in addition been numerous incidents of  self-
    harming, usually by burning. These events have not been  classified  as
    suicide attempts; the Appellant has told clinicians and her counsellors
    that she self-harms in order to cope with anxiety.

48. I accept and find as fact that at least two of the Appellant's  suicide
    attempts have been precipitated  by  her  fear  about  her  immigration
    status. The October 2015 attempt, when she ended up being  admitted  to
    the mental health ward,  was  made  immediately  upon  receipt  of  the
    negative determination of the First-tier  Tribunal.   The  most  recent
    attempt, stymied by the arrival of Ms Sanders and the  SERCO  staff  at
    her NASS accommodation, was  attributed  to  her  anxiety  about  these
    proceedings.

49. Whilst all of  the  mental  health  professionals  who  have  seen  the
    Appellant over  the  years  have  expressed  grave  concern  about  her
    wellbeing, it is Ms Golding who  has  had  the  most  recent  intensive
    contact with her. Like Trish Doocey before her Ms Golding  has  regular
    meetings with the Appellant which have, in  her  case,  been  going  on
    since April 2015. In her  opinion  that  if  the  Appellant  is  facing
    removal there is a "very strong indication" that  the  Appellant  would
    try and take her own life. It is evidently a threat taken seriously  by
    Ms Golding and by the local mental health team, whose  recent  decision
    to check in with the Appellant unannounced led to the discovery of  her
    last overdose.  Whilst I bear in mind that the evidence  of  Consultant
    Psychiatrist Dr Majjiga is now relatively old, I am satisfied, from all
    of the other evidence, that his diagnoses of PTSD and depression remain
    good.

50. The Appellant is a Tamil from Jaffna who remains a believer in the self-
    determination of the Tamil people.   Regardless of whether or  not  her
    account of arrest and ill treatment in 2010 is  true,  I  am  satisfied
    that any subjective fears she holds about the way  that  she  might  be
    treated in Sri Lanka is supported by the  objective  reality.   She  is
    very afraid of the security forces who committed what many Tamils,  and
    indeed external observers, regard as war crimes against her  community.
    She  is  furthermore  a  survivor  of  a  truly  horrific   trafficking
    experience, perpetrated against her by a member of her own family.    I
    find that any fear she holds about being identified by this individual,
    or otherwise coming into contact with members of his family, would also
    be objectively well-founded.

51. The fact that the Appellant is still alive speaks volumes not just  for
    the effectiveness of NHS treatments, but also  for  the  staff  in  the
    various psychological services that the Appellant has accessed over the
    years. She is evidently provided  with  a  great  deal  of  support  by
    specialists  in  the  field  who  are  able  to  detect  when  she   is
    particularly vulnerable, eg the recent intervention by Ms  Sanders.   I
    am satisfied that the UK has in place the procedures and  practices  to
    safeguard the Appellant from herself.

52. I cannot remotely be satisfied that the same safeguards  exist  in  Sri
    Lanka. The evidence cited in the  refusal  letter  is  the  exact  same
    extract from the 2013 COIR which was roundly rejected by  the  Tribunal
    in GJ as providing evidence of protection for the suicidal claimant  in
    that case [at 450].  The fact that anti-depressants  are  available  is
    not going to assist this young woman. She has been  on  high  doses  of
    anti-depressants since 2012 and continues to try and harm herself.  The
    Appellant has survived thus far by  receiving  intensive  support  from
    mental health professionals in the form of talking  therapies,  and  of
    course by the active and timely  interventions  of  her  mental  health
    team. The prospect of her receiving such treatment  in  Sri  Lanka,  in
    time to effectively protect her from Article 3 harm, is next to zero.

53. The First-tier Tribunal thought that the Appellant's recovery would  be
    aided by a return home, because she would be surrounded by her  family.
    The evidence before me indicates that there are three important reasons
    why that would not be the case. Firstly, none of her family are, as far
    as I am aware,  mental  health  professionals.   The  medical  evidence
    before  me  is  that  the  Appellant  has  been  diagnosed  with  three
    classified mental illnesses. Home comforts and being with  people  that
    you love would no doubt abate such conditions to some degree, but those
    things are in this case unlikely to be  an  effective  replacement  for
    specialised care.  Secondly, the use of family as care-givers would for
    the Appellant be a form of isolation.  The most traumatic  elements  of
    her abuse - her sexual abuse and rape -  have  been  omitted  from  the
    account given to her family, because  such  matters  remain  taboo  and
    complex in a society that still looks to blame the victim, rather  than
    the perpetrator of such attacks.  Finally, the Appellant has repeatedly
    expressed fears that S will be able to easily locate her at the  family
    home, most  recently  to  Margaret  Sanders  of  Bridgewater  Community
    Healthcare.  S is now out of prison in France and has already  starting
    asking questions about where the Appellant is. Given the  history,  the
    Appellant's subjective fear would be overwhelming. It would be  Y  &  Z
    objectively well-founded.

54. The already high threshold for a  violation  of  Article  3  on  health
    grounds is elevated yet higher in 'foreign cases'. I bear that in mind.
    I cannot however  escape  from  the  force  of  the  medical  evidence,
    produced not just by one Consultant Psychiatrist  asked  to  conduct  a
    single assessment, but collated over a  four  year  period  by  various
    health agencies and mental health professionals with close contact with
    the Appellant. This young woman is plainly a danger  to  herself;  that
    danger is driven and heightened by her sad personal history  of  abuse.
    Having taken all of the evidence into account I am satisfied that there
    are substantial grounds to believe that the Appellant  would  take  her
    own life should she be removed to Sri Lanka.


    Risk of trafficking: risk as a member of a particular social group


55. What I know about S is that he is a trafficker.  It  is  perhaps  self-
    evident from that statement that he is a  person  who  is  prepared  to
    exploit others, in this case the Appellant, for his own  personal  gain
    or satisfaction. This exploitation is accompanied by extreme levels  of
    physical and psychological abuse.   I also know that he served  a  term
    of imprisonment in France. We do not know why.  It  may  have  been  in
    connection with his abduction of the Appellant, but since she  was  not
    called to give evidence this seems unlikely.  The  Appellant  has  been
    told by her aunt that he is now looking for her.   I find that to be  a
    plausible scenario. The events in 2011 strongly indicate that he is not
    a man for whom compassionate or logic figure in  decision  making;  nor
    does he appear to be a man concerned with the legal consequences of his
    actions, nor indeed basic human morality.  The Appellant knew who S was
    when she saw him standing at  Terminal  3  because  she  had  seen  his
    photograph in her mother's hand back  in  Sri  Lanka.  Her  mother  had
    wanted to arrange her marriage to  this  man.  It  is  therefore  self-
    evident that  there  is  a  degree  of  proximity  between  S  and  the
    Appellant's family. He certainly knows where they live.  He  has  other
    family members in Sri Lanka who  would  be  able  to  tell  him  if  he
    doesn't.  Having taken all of those matters into account I am satisfied
    that there would be a real risk that S would quickly find the Appellant
    should she return to the family home. There would in all likelihood  be
    a high risk of serious harm if that occurred.  S  is  a  dangerous  and
    driven individual.


56. The question then is whether the Appellant could  reasonably  dislocate
    herself from her family to go and live somewhere else on her own in Sri
    Lanka. She could for instance stay in Colombo, as she did in late  2010
    when she was on her way to  the  United  Kingdom.  If  my  findings  on
    Article 3 are correct then it is clear that it would  not  be  possible
    for her to do so.  I have considered the matter of internal  flight  in
    the alternative.  I  presume  for  the  purposes  of  this  alternative
    assessment that the Appellant does not kill herself, and that  the  Sri
    Lankan security services have no interest in her at all.   I do  so  on
    the basis of the accepted facts.

57. The Appellant is a 28 year-old woman who holds three  good  'A'  levels
    and has some work experience in Sri Lanka.   It  must  be  acknowledged
    that she has demonstrated a certain level of resilience thus far.   She
    would have the benefit of operating in a society she  understands.  She
    knows the culture and the language. Whilst I appreciate that for safety
    reasons she cannot reasonably be expected to live with her  mother  and
    father there is no reason why she  could  not  stay  in  touch  and  be
    financially supported by them.  She may be able to receive some support
    from a charity, for instance in the form of  a  micro-finance  loan  to
    start her own business. Against those positive  indicators  weighs  the
    following.

58. The Appellant, is it accepted by the Respondent,  has  been  through  a
    horrific and prolonged  period  of  abduction  and  imprisonment.  Even
    discounting the sexual abuse (not disclosed to the Competent Authority)
    she was, on the accepted facts, held against her will and subjected  to
    extreme physical and psychological violence.  As a result,  Mr  McVeety
    accepts, she is not at all well.  She  suffers  from  various  symptoms
    including  flashbacks,  nightmares,  depression,  and   anxiety   which
    overwhelms her so the extent that she must self-harm in order to  quiet
    it.     Her subjective fear  - even absent the threat of suicide  -  is
    acknowledged to be substantial.  She would be living alone in  a  South
    Asian society where the norm is for young unmarried woman to be  living
    with her parents.  The only evidence that I have been given about women
    in Sri Lanka is section 3.13 of the Respondent's  Operational  Guidance
    Note of 2013. That makes clear that although the law  and  constitution
    of Sri Lanka  makes  various  guarantees  about  gender  equality,  the
    reality on the ground is somewhat different.  For  instance,  "the  law
    prohibiting rape and domestic violence  is  not  enforced  effectively.
    Sexual  assault,  rape,  and  spousal  abuse  were  pervasive  societal
    problems" [at 3.13.2]. They suffer inequality and discrimination in the
    workplace [3.13.2].    Most significantly Sri Lanka is described  as  a
    source country for trafficking of  women,  with  "internally  displaced
    persons,  war  widows,  and   unregistered   female   migrants"   being
    particularly vulnerable in that context [3.3.15].


59. Having considered all of those factors, and having particular regard to
    the  personal  circumstances  of  the  Appellant  (as  agreed  by   the
    Respondent) I have no doubt that it  would  be  unduly  harsh  for  the
    Appellant to try and live somewhere else in Sri Lanka.  Her  subjective
    fear of discovery by S, and having to deal with her varied and  complex
    mental health problems on her own are factors  which  would  themselves
    prevent the Appellant from living anything like a 'normal' life in  Sri
    Lanka. Add to this the objective risk that as a lone woman she would be
    vulnerable to trafficking, in a society where  sexual  assault  against
    women remains a "pervasive" problem, it is clear that  internal  flight
    would not be a safe or reasonable option for this Appellant.


    Risk from the authorities: persecution for  reasons  of  her  political
    opinion


60. The Appellant is a Tamil from Jaffna who grew up at the height  of  the
    LTTE insurgency. As the Tribunal in GJ note, it  is  reasonably  likely
    that anyone of  that  ethnicity  in  that  area  would  have  had  some
    connection to the organisation. They formed  the  effective  government
    for a period,  and  built  grassroots  support  in  the  community.   I
    therefore find it to be wholly  plausible  that  as  a  schoolgirl  the
    Appellant had sympathies for the Tigers and  would  help  them  as  she
    described by providing food and small donations. In that context I  see
    no reason to reject, on the lower standard,  her  claim  that  she  was
    asked to help them produce propaganda at the computer centre where  she
    worked. The First-tier Tribunal was troubled by her  "vagueness"  about
    what happened to the materials after she handed them over,  but  it  is
    not  her  case  that  she  was  involved  in  their  distribution.  The
    Respondent considered there to be an inconsistency in her claim to have
    done this work and her evidence that she  did  not  want  to  join  the
    Tigers for  fear  of  what  would  happen  to  her  family.  I  see  no
    inconsistency. Performing an essentially menial task on a few occasions
    is qualitatively different from joining a guerrilla group and launching
    assaults on the Sri Lankan Army.  Her evidence about  this  period  has
    been consistent, and is consonant with the country background material.
    I accept that the Appellant did produce propaganda for the LTTE at  her
    workplace on 3-4 occasions.


61. The Appellant claims to have been arrested in August  2010,  apparently
    because her involvement in the leaflets came to their attention.    The
    principle objection advanced by the Respondent to this evidence is  the
    fact that this would have post-dated the end of the conflict by over  a
    year. We know that by that time  the  LTTE  were  a  spent  force,  and
    applying the reasoning in GJ it is difficult to see why the authorities
    in Jaffna were still interested in pursuing 'small  fry'  such  as  the
    Appellant.  I have considered this point carefully.  It  is  true  that
    the Tribunal found that the focus of the  security  forces  would  have
    shifted, but it is not at all true that there was a  finding  that  all
    human rights abuses in Sri Lanka had ended with the  death,  arrest  or
    're-education' of the last Tiger.  That was not the  evidence,  nor  in
    fact what the decision was concerned with: the focus of the decision in
    GJ was on the risk to Tamils returning  from  the  diaspora.    On  the
    evidence before me the Respondent's submission holds no  water.  Whilst
    human rights abuses against Tamils in  Jaffna  may  have  significantly
    decreased following  the  end  of  open  war,  the  country  background
    material continued, and continues,  to report numerous cases  of  short
    term detention and ill-treatment. For instance,  in the most recent CIG
    published by the Respondent [August 2016]:

         6.1.7 The Amnesty International Report 2015/16 - The State of the
         World's Human Rights - Sri Lanka, published 24 February 2016,
         stated:


         'A new government in January  brought  constitutional  reforms  and
         promises of improved human rights  protection.  Many  human  rights
         challenges remained, including persistent use of  arbitrary  arrest
         and  detention,   torture   and   other   ill-treatment,   enforced
         disappearances and deaths in custody, and a  long-standing  climate
         of impunity for these and other violations.'

62. I cannot therefore find the Appellant's consistent claim to  have  been
    arrested and detained to be incredible or  at  odds  with  the  country
    background material. Her claim is supported,  not  disproved,  by  that
    evidence.  I accept and find as fact that the Appellant was arrested in
    August 2010.   That date accords with her having applied,  in  December
    2010,  for a UK visa in order to leave Sri Lanka.


63. The country background evidence has always been unambiguous  about  the
    risk of ill-treatment in detention in Sri Lanka.  On the lower standard
    of proof it appears to me that it would be perverse to  reject  without
    reason an account of ill-treatment,  including  sexual  abuse,  if  the
    detention itself was accepted. See for instance the reports by  Amnesty
    International, the UN and the US State Department  cited  in  the  most
    recent CIG:

         6.6.1 The US State Department's 2015 Country Report on Human Rights
         Practices (USSD Report 2015), Sri Lanka, published on 13 April
         2016, noted that:


         'There were credible reports during the year that police and
         military forces abducted, tortured, raped, and sexually abused
         citizens. The PTA [Prevention of Terrorism Act] allows courts to
         admit as evidence confessions extracted by torture.


         'In the east and north, military intelligence  and  other  security
         personnel, sometimes allegedly working  with  paramilitary  groups,
         were responsible for the documented and undocumented  detention  of
         civilians accused of  LTTE  connections.  Observers  reported  that
         interrogation sometimes included mistreatment or torture  following
         detention. There were reports that authorities  released  detainees
         with a warning not to reveal  information  about  their  arrest  or
         detention, under the threats of re-arrest or death.'

64. I note that the Appellant did not initially disclose that she was raped
    whilst in that detention.  For  the  reasons  well  articulated  by  Ms
    Doocey, that is not a matter which adversely impacts on  my  assessment
    of her evidence. It is very common for survivors of  sexual  assault  -
    regardless of their cultural background - to be reluctant to talk about
    that experience.  I note the evidence of Ms Doocey and Ms Golding  that
    since disclosing the Appellant has been entirely consistent about  what
    happened to her, and the distress that it has  caused.   On  the  lower
    standard of proof, and taking all of the evidence in the round, I  find
    that the Appellant was ill-treated and raped  in  detention  in  August
    2010.


65. The Appellant has suffered persecution for  reasons  of  her  political
    opinion. The serious harm she suffered included detention  and  serious
    violence. There was a failure of state protection. In  accordance  with
    paragraph 339K of the Immigration Rules I take that  as  an  indication
    that such harm would re-occur, unless there are good  reasons  to  find
    that circumstances have changed so as to reduce or obviate that risk.

66. Unlike the cases considered  in  GJ  the  Appellant  is  a  person  who
    suffered  persecution  in  Sri  Lanka  long  after  the  cessation   of
    hostilities in May 2009. She is therefore a person for whom  the  state
    did hold an adverse interest post-conflict. I must examine the  country
    background material to assess whether there has been a material  change
    in circumstances since August 2010.

67. Some factors in the latest CIG signify a  welcome  improvement  in  the
    human rights situation in Sri Lanka.  As it is put at [2.3.6]  of  that
    report "the element of fear has considerably diminished in Colombo  and
    the South"  and there has been a  restoration  of  the  legitimacy  and
    independence of Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission.  These  are  views
    attributed to the United Nations High Commissioner  for  Human  Rights,
    Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, in a speech made in February 2016 [at 6.1.1]. Mr
    Al Hussein is  also  reported  to  have  expressed  concern  about  the
    situation in the North and East of the country [that would include  the
    Appellant's home state of Jaffna]. The  CIG  reproduces  the  following
    recent reports on the situation in the North:

         6.1.2 The Freedom House report, Freedom in the World 2015 - Sri
         Lanka, 19 June 2015, stated:


         'Authorities reportedly monitor the personal communications and
         activities of individuals known to be critical of the government,
         particularly in the Tamil-populated north and east, and a growing
         climate of fear dissuades many individuals from expressing dissent
         on politics or other sensitive matters. Former LTTE fighters and
         their social circles face special scrutiny and are repeatedly
         questioned by authorities, infiltrated by intelligence personnel,
         and encouraged to inform on their associates. Security forces have
         engaged in abusive practices, including arbitrary arrest,
         extrajudicial execution, forced disappearance, custodial rape,
         torture, and prolonged detention without trial, all of which
         disproportionately affect Tamils.'


          6.1.3 The US State Department's 2015 Country Report on Human
         Rights Practices (USSD Report 2015), Sri Lanka, published on 13
         April 2016, identified that:


         'The major human rights problems reported during the year included
         harassment of civil society activists, journalists, and persons
         viewed as sympathizers of the banned terrorist group the LTTE as
         well as arbitrary arrest and detention, torture, rape, and other
         forms of sexual and gender-based violence committed by police and
         security forces.'


         6.1.4 The Human Rights Watch (HRW) annual report 2016, stated:


         'The [Maithripala Sirisena] government quickly abolished
         surveillance and censorship of media and civil society groups,
         embarked on constitutional reforms to restrict executive powers,
         and took steps to restore the independence of the judiciary. In
         contrast to the combative approach of the Rajapaksa government, it
         also initiated a new, more open dialogue with the international
         community, including human rights organizations.  However, the
         government took no significant measures to end impunity for
         security force abuse, including police use of torture. At time of
         writing, the government also had not yet repealed the draconian
         Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), despite promises to do so, and
         continued to detain people under it. Following a sustained hunger
         strike by an estimated 200 PTA detainees, the government in
         November released some on bail, sent others for rehabilitation, and
         pledged to charge and try the rest.'

68. Applying the lower standard of proof I am not satisfied, on  the  basis
    of such evidence, that the risk to the Appellant has abated. She  faces
    a real risk  of  being  identified  in  Jaffna  as  a  person  who  was
    previously arrested upon suspicion of producing LTTE  propaganda  post-
    conflict; she is a person who was  supposed  to  report  to  the  local
    police station and did not do so.  Applying those facts to the guidance
    in GJ I find it to be reasonably likely that she is on  a  'stop'  list
    and would be a person of interest to the CID. Applying the guidance  in
    paragraph 339K of the Rules I cannot be satisfied that there  are  good
    reasons to believe that such persecution would not reoccur. I find that
    the Appellant would be at risk of serious harm in Jaffna.


69. In respect of internal flight my findings [at 56-59] above apply. There
    is in this instance the additional factor of persecution emanating from
    the state. In those circumstances the Respondent accepts that  internal
    flight would not be a realistic option: see [2.3.14] of the  2016  CIG,
    adopting the conclusions of the Tribunal in GJ.   I therefore allow the
    appeal on 'political asylum' grounds.


    Article 8: physical and moral intergrity


70. Given my conclusions on the Refugee Convention and Article  3  grounds,
    there would be little utility in making the same findings on Article  8
    because the outcome would inevitably be that  the  Appellant's  removal
    would be unlawful and disproportionate.  I therefore  propose  to  deal
    briefly with Article 8 on the basis of  the  uncontested  facts  alone,
    these being:

        . That she has been in the UK since 2012


        . Since her arrival  she  has  received  significant  support  from
          mental health services both within and outwith the NHS


        . Her treatment includes talking therapies as well as high  dosages
          of anti-depressant medication


        . She continues to have some contact with her family in Sri Lanka


        . She has suffered from serious harm,  having  been  trafficked  in
          France for a period of approximately 6 months in 2011


        . She has PTSD, anxiety and depression[1], regularly self-harms and
          has attempted suicide on a number of occasions


        . She has a very substantial subjective fear of being re-trafficked
          or otherwise harmed by S which means that she does  not  want  to
          live with her family


        . She is a Tamil from Jaffna

71.  I  consider  first  the  Appellant's  private  life  claim  under  the
    Immigration Rules, as set out in paragraph 276ADE.  The  Appellant  has
    not been in this country long  enough  to  qualify  under  any  of  the
    alternative provisions based on age and length of residence, and  could
    therefore only hope to succeed under sub-paragraph (vi),  the  material
    part of which requires her to show that she is:

         "aged 18 years or above, has lived continuously in the UK for  less
         than 20 years (discounting any period of  imprisonment)  but  there
         would be very significant obstacles to the applicant's  integration
         into the country to which he would have to go if required to  leave
         the UK".

72. The test of "very significant obstacles" is a high one.  The  Appellant
    is  required  to  show  not  that  she  would  face  inconvenience,  or
    difficulties, but very significant  obstacles  to  her  being  able  to
    effectively integrate into life in Sri Lanka.  For the purposes of this
    assessment, it appears to me that there is  little  difference  between
    the question of reasonableness of internal flight,  and  the  questions
    raised in sub-section (vi).   There are two alternative  scenarios  for
    her return. She could go back to her family in  Jaffna.  The  Appellant
    would have ready access to housing, and to material  support.  Although
    she has not to date felt able to tell her family about being raped,  it
    may be that in time with their support she could make that  disclosure.
    The Appellant would nevertheless have to live in  that  situation  with
    her very real and substantial fear of S looming over  her.  As  I  note
    above, her fear is,  if  not  objectively  well-founded,  not  entirely
    fanciful. He is a relative of her mothers and as such  the  information
    that she was back in the family home would likely at some point  filter
    back to him. In her present psychological state  I  have  grave  doubts
    about whether the Appellant would be able to live  with  that  fear.  I
    think the altogether more likely outcome would be that she would try to
    live alone somewhere else in Sri Lanka. For all the  reasons  canvassed
    above in the context of the Refugee  Convention,  that  too  is  deeply
    problematic.  She would then be a young single woman living apart  from
    her family, with  serious  mental  health  problems  and  no  means  of
    accessing psychological support services that she has become  dependent
    upon in the UK.  This means that whatever financial, and from  time  to
    time emotional and physical support that her family are able  to  offer
    her, the Appellant is left in  the  same  predicament  that  I  discuss
    above. Even if her fear of S and the Sri Lankan state have no objective
    foundation, she would still be crippled by her overwhelming  subjective
    fear of the same.  I have serious doubts  about  her  ability  to  find
    employment or housing in her present mental state. It does not seem  to
    me  that  the  Appellant  would  have  any  prospects   of   meaningful
    integration at all.  I therefore allow her  appeal  with  reference  to
    paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules.

      Decisions

73. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contained  errors  of  law
    and it is set aside.


74. I remake the decision in the appeal as follows:

    "The appeal is allowed on asylum grounds.


    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds (Articles 3 & 8)


    The Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection because she is
    a refugee"


75. An Order for anonymity has been made and the parties are reminded  that
    it could be a contempt of court to breach it.

                          DECISION ON ERROR OF LAW
                     DECISION TO ADJOURN and DIRECTIONS

 1. The Appellant is a female national of Sri Lanka born in 1988.  She  has
    permission[2] to appeal  against  a  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Lever)[3] to dismiss her appeal against a  decision  to
    refuse to grant her leave to enter[4]. That decision followed rejection
    of her asylum and human rights claims.


    Background and Matters in Issue


 2. The Appellant came to the United Kingdom as a student in January  2011.
     On the 14th December 2011 she claimed  asylum  in  Switzerland.    The
    Respondent accepts that what transpired between those  dates  was  that
    the Appellant was met  at  Heathrow  by  a  distant  relative,  V,  who
    immediately took her by car to Paris. There he told her  that  she  was
    going to marry him.  When  she  refused  he  imprisoned  her.  She  was
    tortured and beaten on various occasions over several months. In  early
    December the Appellant was able to escape with  the  assistance  of  an
    aunt who lives in Paris. This aunt took her in and then after some time
    to  Switzerland  where  she  claimed  asylum.  The  Swiss   authorities
    requested that the United Kingdom accept responsibility for  the  claim
    under the Dublin Convention, because this had been her first  point  of
    entry to Europe. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the  UK  did
    accept responsibility and the Appellant was returned to  London,  where
    she claimed asylum at port on the 6th September 2012.


 3. Her claim for protection was threefold:

        i) She feared return  to  Sri  Lanka  on  the  basis  of  her  past
           persecution for reasons of her involvement with  the  LTTE.  The
           Appellant claims that she produced and distributed  leaflets  on
           behalf of the  organisation  and  that  in  2010  she  had  been
           arrested and ill-treated. She was released from  detention  upon
           payment of a bribe. She now feared that if returned to Sri Lanka
           from London the authorities would perceive her to be an activist
           committed to the destruction of the unitary state of  Sri  Lanka
           and/or she would be on a 'stop list' such that she would  be  at
           risk of serious harm;


       ii) She feared return to Sri Lanka  because  the  authorities  there
           would not be able to protect her against the actions of  V,  who
           would be able to find her and once more target  her  for  forced
           marriage;


      iii) As a result of her experiences the Appellant was suffering  from
           Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder to the extent  that  her  removal
           would be a disproportionate  interference  with  her  Article  8
           private  life  and/or  a  violation  of  the  United   Kingdom's
           obligations under Article 3 ECHR.

 4. The Respondent's reasons for refusal letter is dated 7th  August  2014.
    In respect of the Appellant's involvement with the  LTTE  ('the  asylum
    claim') the Respondent  rejected  the  account  as  not  credible.  The
    Appellant had given inconsistent dates about  her  claimed  arrest  and
    about the extent of her involvement in the LTTE. As for the account  of
    imprisonment and abuse at the hands of V ('the trafficking claim')  the
    immigration officer who first interviewed  the  Appellant  at  Heathrow
    Terminal 5 had been concerned enough  to  find  the  National  Referral
    Mechanism for the  identification  of  victims  of  trafficking  to  be
    engaged. The Appellant's case had  been  considered  by  the  Competent
    Authority which in a letter dated 28th November 2012 had concluded that
    she was a victim of trafficking.  The circumstances of  her  case  were
    not however such that the Secretary of State was prepared  to  exercise
    discretion in her favour.  As for the  submission  that  the  Appellant
    should not be required to leave the UK because of her claimed PTSD  and
    depressive disorder ('the mental health claim') the Respondent rejected
    the medical evidence. It  was  not  accepted  that  the  Appellant  was
    suffering from PTSD; if she was she would  receive  adequate  treatment
    for this condition in Sri Lanka.


 5.  These then were the three matters that were in issue before the First-
    tier Tribunal.

    The Determination of the First-tier Tribunal

 6. The First-tier Tribunal rejected the  asylum  claim.   The  Appellant's
    case was that in 2006 she had started producing propaganda leaflets for
    the LTTE and had done so for approximately  four  years.  The  Tribunal
    found "almost no evidence" about how she had managed to do this [� 21].
    She claimed that she had been approached in the street,  apparently  at
    random and asked to provide money and food for  the  Tigers.  This  was
    found to be "unlikely".  The  Appellant  had  said  that  she  had  not
    formally joined the organisation because  she  was  worried  about  the
    consequences for her family; the Tribunal found this to be inconsistent
    with her decision to print the leaflets and raise funds, both of  which
    could have drawn adverse attention to her family.   The  Appellant  had
    said that she had no intention of leaving  Sri  Lanka  before  she  was
    arrested in August 2010, and yet the Tribunal found there to  be  clear
    evidence of such an intention going back to 2009 when  she  obtained  a
    passport. She had obtained a reference from a former employer  in  July
    2010 and had managed to secure  a  college  place  in  the  UK  by  the
    October.  Overall it was not accepted that the Appellant's account  was
    true. Even if it was she did not fall within any of the risk categories
    identified in the country guidance case of GJ and  Others  (post  civil
    war: returnees) Sri Lanka CG [2013] UKUT 319.

 7. The determination then turns to the trafficking claim. The analysis  is
    introduced with the following remarks [� 30]:

         "I deal with the second aspect of the Appellant's claim,  which  is
         an unusual matter,  namely the trafficking  matter.   As  indicated
         above the trafficking report whilst lengthy in  terms  of  criteria
         and law is very short in terms of analysis and  assessment  of  the
         Appellant's evidence and circumstances.  It leaves  the  number  of
         questions unanswered. I make it clear however  that  I  do  not  go
         behind that report, adopted as it was by the Home Office  including
         at the hearing. However  I  am  bound  to  analyse  the  facts  and
         circumstances to arrive at proper conclusions  in  particular  upon
         any risk to the Appellant and  circumstances  upon  return  to  Sri
         Lanka".

 8. The determination finds that the Appellant's family are  supportive  of
    her. It is noted that when she had refused V's proposal of marriage  in
    2006 her parents had respected that decision.  They  were  prepared  to
    allow her to finish her education to the extent that they sponsored her
    study in the UK.  There is no  evidence  that  they  were  in  any  way
    complicit in her kidnap.    It  is  not  clear  how  V  knew  that  the
    Appellant was arriving at Heathrow that day. She had believed that  she
    was being met by a cousin  who  had  not  arrived.    The  position  in
    respect of this  cousin  is  found  to  be  "curious".  The  First-tier
    Tribunal notes that the Home Office failed to contact this gentleman in
    the course of the trafficking enquiry. This is identified as one of the
    "unknown and untested areas of evidence and questions" in the Competent
    Authority decision.  The Tribunal is however satisfied  that  with  the
    possible exception of the cousin, no other member  of  the  Appellant's
    family were involved in her abduction. Her aunt  and  uncle  in  France
    actively assisted her in escaping. Concluding that this is  in  reality
    "not a trafficking case as such even if it theoretically  falls  within
    certain criteria, arbitrarily set out" the First-tier Tribunal finds no
    risk to the Appellant today in Sri Lanka. The man who abducted her is a
    criminal, who apparently had no assistance apart from  two  accomplices
    in Paris.  There is no evidence to suggest that he is in Sri Lanka  and
    he may be in prison in France [� 39].


 9. Finally, the determination addresses the evidence  in  respect  of  the
    Appellant's mental health.  This is described as a "psychiatric report"
    and a "Counsellor's report".  Judge Lever is  not  surprised  that  the
    Appellant has been  diagnosed  with  PTSD:  the  circumstances  of  her
    imprisonment in France would  be  sufficient  trauma  to  provoke  such
    symptoms. He is not however persuaded that the  medical  evidence  adds
    anything to the asylum  claim:  this  is  a  case  where  it  would  be
    difficult to separate one trauma from another. In this  context  it  is
    "curious" that the psychiatrist appears to place more emphasis  on  the
    Appellant's claimed detention in Sri  Lanka  in  2010.   The  Appellant
    would be returning to her family in Sri  Lanka  who  have  demonstrated
    their willingness to support her in the past. It may be that  the  best
    help and support would be more  likely  to  come  from  family  friends
    rather  than  paid  professionals.  At  41  the  determination   states
    "reference was made to a potential breach of Article 3 or Article 8  on
    return in respect of her moral integrity. If by that  phrase  it  means
    the right of the Appellant to seek peace and recovery properly from the
    ordeal that took place in France then I would have  thought  it  rather
    obvious that her home country, amongst friends and family and far  away
    from France, would be the more obvious place for her to gain her  moral
    integrity".


    The Appeal

10. Before me Mr Nicholson adopted his grounds of appeal to submit that the
    First-tier Tribunal determination should be set aside for the following
    reasons:

              i) The Appellant did not have a fair hearing


             ii) It was not open to the Tribunal to disparage or  go  behind
                 the findings of the Competent Authority


            iii) The First-tier Tribunal failed to consider the totality  of
                 the medical evidence in the round when reaching its adverse
                 credibility findings


             iv) The suggestion that the medical experts would not  be  able
                 to tell one trauma from another was "unduly weak"


              v) There was a failure to give reasons

11. Ms Johnstone opposed the appeal on all grounds. She submitted that  the
    determination was well reasoned, and  that  the  Tribunal  had  reached
    findings open to it on the evidence. The determination makes  it  clear
    that the decision of the Competent Authority  has  been  accepted.  The
    findings are based on those conclusions. The Tribunal was entitled,  as
    part of its risk assessment, to observe that this was not  a  'classic'
    case of trafficking.


    Findings on Error of Law


    Fair Trial


12. In refusing permission to appeal Designated First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Manuell described the Grounds as being "bold  assertions"  "couched  in
    extravagant language".  That was presumably a reference to this:

         "he did not take  notes  during  the  submissions  on  A's  behalf,
         although Counsel slowed down and  indeed  repeated  submissions  in
         order to enable this to take place - he  was  reading  through  the
         papers because evidently he had not done so before the hearing"

    Before me Mr Nicholson expanded on his criticism  of  the  hearing.  He
    said that at the beginning of the process Judge Lever had "leaned  back
    in his chair with his arms folded and said that this was not  really  a
    trafficking case, whilst the Appellant sat and cried in front of  him".
    Mr Nicholson submitted that he had observed the Judge not to have taken
    any notes through  the  course  of  the  hearing,  including  when  the
    Appellant was giving her evidence. That he had not taken the  extensive
    submissions made on behalf of the Appellant into  account  was  evident
    from the determination.

13. Those instructing Mr Nicholson have made repeated  requests  for  Judge
    Lever's Record of Proceedings (ROP) to be disclosed. It  is  not  clear
    why those requests were not addressed prior to the appeal being listed.
    I gave both parties a copy of the ROP at the beginning of the  hearing.
    What it shows is that the Appellant was called to  give  evidence,  and
    adopted her witness statement. The cross examination is then  recorded,
    and the submissions of each party;  the latter  take  up  approximately
    half a page each.


14. Taking the ROP into account I can say with certainty that  Judge  Lever
    did indeed take some notes. That is the only  actual  evidence  I  have
    about his conduct at the  hearing.  There  is  no  statement  from  the
    Appellant to say that she was in any way unhappy about the process.  Mr
    Nicholson submitted that upon receipt of  Judge  Lever's  decision  the
    Appellant had attempted suicide and had been hospitalised;  her  mental
    health remains precarious. Whilst this would offer an  explanation  for
    the absence of a statement from the Appellant, there is no reason as to
    why Mr Nicholson has not prepared a statement  himself.    It  is  long
    established practice that if  Counsel  wishes  to  rely  on  their  own
    observation of something that happened at hearing, they should become a
    witness. Ideally Counsel should produce  a  written  statement  and  be
    prepared for their evidence to be tested.  Alternative  counsel  should
    be instructed. At the very  least  Counsel's  note  of  hearing  and/or
    backsheet should be produced, and the Respondent  invited  to  disclose
    their own.   None of that has happened here.  It follows that I  cannot
    be remotely satisfied, on the basis of Mr Nicholson's "bold assertions"
    that there was any inappropriate behaviour on the part of Judge Lever.


    The Competent Authority Report

15. The First-tier Tribunal expressly states  that  does  not  seek  to  go
    behind the conclusions of the Competent Authority [� 30].  It expressly
    accepts that the Appellant has been through the ordeal  of  kidnap  and
    ill-treatment that she describes [see for instance at � 37]. What  then
    is the complaint of the Appellant?


16. The complaint is twofold. First it is submitted that  in  the  "lengthy
    disparaging" of the Competent Authority report [� 31-37]  the  Tribunal
    has implicitly played down any risk that she might today  face,  either
    from V or from herself.   This, it is said, led to an  incomplete  risk
    assessment, particularly when considered alongside the  approach  taken
    to the medical evidence.  I accept that there is  some  force  in  that
    submission. The Tribunal has categorised the Appellant's ordeal  as  an
    isolated criminal act  and  has  made  its  assessment  of  risk,  both
    objective and subjective, accordingly.    In that regard  it  does  not
    appear that the determination has considered  at  all  the  Appellant's
    evidence that she fears retribution from her attacker's family: see for
    instance paragraph 18 of her witness statement.

17. Second, it is submitted that the findings are ambiguous.  Although  the
    determination states [� 30] that the Tribunal  does  not  seek  to  'go
    behind' the report of the Competent Authority the remainder of the text
    leaves the reader with the strong  impression  that  the  Tribunal  has
    placed very little weight on it at all.   The  framework  for  analysis
    applied by the Competent Authority is  described  as  "arbitrary",  the
    claim itself as  "unusual" and "curious"  and the report  is  found  to
    leave "questions  unanswered".  Paragraphs  31-37  raise  a  number  of
    questions about the account, such as the possible  involvement  of  the
    cousin who was supposed to meet the Appellant on arrival, and  how  her
    attacker knew that she would be disembarking that flight.  I accept  Mr
    Nicholson's submission that the length and force of the  criticisms  of
    the report would have left the  Appellant  unclear  about  whether  her
    account of kidnap and imprisonment was in fact accepted as true by  the
    Tribunal.


    The Medical Evidence

18. The medical  evidence  before  the  Tribunal  was  not  limited  to  an
    assessment made in isolation for  the  purpose  of  this  appeal.   The
    report dated 12th March 2015 from  Consultant  Psychiatrist  Dr  Venkat
    Chetan Reddy Majjiga  was  prepared  with  access  to  the  Appellant's
    hospital and GP notes and the records provided  by  the  mental  health
    team of  the  '5  Boroughs  Partnership  NHS  Foundation  Trust'.   His
    conclusion that the Appellant was suffering from PTSD and was  actively
    self harming was based not only on his own observations  (for  instance
    her tearfulness and scars seen during  the  consultation)  but  on  the
    clinical diagnosis  made  by  colleagues  who  had  been  treating  the
    Appellant  since  December  2013.  The  Appellant's   medical   records
    confirmed that a diagnoses of PTSD and depression  had  been  made  and
    that she had  been  prescribed  not  only  anti-depressants  but  anti-
    psychotic medication.


19. Written evidence from 'PSS Spinning World Psychological Services' dated
    20th May 2014, 15th October 2014 and 2nd December 2014  confirmed  that
    prior to the Appellant's engagement with the psychiatric  team  at  the
    hospital she had been referred to that  organisation  as  long  ago  as
    October 2012.   Her records showed that in her regular sessions (weekly
    since December 2013) she had disclosed not only PTSD symptoms  but  had
    expressed  thoughts  of  suicide.   The  records  held  by  psychiatric
    services showed incidents of  self  harm  (cutting  and  burning)  from
    October 2013, and in January 2014 that she was suicidal and  unable  to
    leave her home.  The records held by the  mental  health  nursing  team
    showed that she was being prescribed high doses of  strong  medication.
    The records held by the counselling  service  showed  that  her  mental
    health issues were also impacting her  physically  including  suffering
    from strong headaches and an inability to keep food down. Trish Dooley,
    the qualified counsellor who wrote the three letters from 'PSS Spinning
    World Psychological Services' emphasised that in the 90+  sessions  she
    had had with the Appellant (at that point) the  Appellant's  recounting
    of her history, as well as her description of her  symptoms,  had  been
    entirely consistent. Ms Dooley  records  her  own  observation  of  the
    Appellant's distress, tearfulness and 'shame response' when  discussing
    the sexual abuse she suffered during her trafficking experience.


20. This medical evidence is summarised and considered in the determination
    in a single short paragraph [� 38].  The Tribunal records  that  it  is
    "not surprised" that the Appellant suffers from PTSD but rejects as not
    credible the consensus expressed by the clinicians that the Appellant's
    symptoms arise from the cumulative trauma of her  experiences  in  both
    Sri Lanka and France "where it would be difficult if not impossible  to
    separate alleged  trauma  from  one  incident  from  real  trauma  from
    another".

21. Mr Nicholson submits that there was an "abject  failure"  to  take  the
    medical evidence into account.  Ms Johnstone submits that ground to  be
    unarguable given that the  Tribunal  expressly  accepts  the  diagnosis
    made.

22. I am satisfied that the determination contains two discrete  errors  in
    approach to the medical  evidence.   The  Appellant's  contention  that
    there has been a Mibanga failure to consider all of the evidence in the
    round has been made out. The  Tribunal plainly reaches its  conclusions
    as to the credibility of the asylum claim [� 20-25] in  isolation  from
    the medical evidence.  There is then a post-facto  attempt  to  justify
    that approach by the remarks at paragraph  38.  Mr  Nicholson  submits,
    with justification, that where a Consultant Psychiatrist has reached  a
    conclusion based on extensive clinical  records  as  well  as  his  own
    assessment it is not sufficient that his opinion is dismissed  as  "not
    credible".  Although it is conceded that the Tribunal  was  in  no  way
    bound to accept the opinion of Dr Majjiga (or  his  colleagues)  it  is
    required as a matter of law to give cogent and intelligible reasons  if
    limited weight is placed upon it.  Had the Tribunal had concerns  about
    the ability of the clinicians to extricate  one  trauma,  or  sequalae,
    from another, this is a matter that should have been raised to give the
    Appellant  an  opportunity  to  address  those  concerns.   There   was
    furthermore no analysis at all of the evidence of Trish Dooley, who had
    pointed out that over the course  of  in  excess  of  90  meetings  the
    Appellant had  been  entirely  consistent  in  her  recounting  of  her
    history. That was a matter  capable  of  weighing  in  the  Appellant's
    favour in the assessment of her credibility.

23. The second issue is related  to  the  overall  approach  taken  to  the
    trafficking claim. The global  conclusion  reached  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was that the Appellant would be far better off going back into
    the care of her family who would protect her  and  assist  her  in  her
    recovery. Had the Tribunal read the medical reports in  their  entirety
    it would have noted that the Appellant has not been able  to  tell  her
    family that she  was  sexually  assaulted  during  the  course  of  her
    imprisonment. As Ms Dooley notes this is entirely consistent  with  the
    "deep shame" response experienced by survivors of rape.   The  Tribunal
    fails to take that matter into account in reaching its conclusion  that
    the Appellant's family would be better placed to care for her than  the
    team of medical professionals that is currently  deemed  necessary  for
    her own protection and treatment.  I am  satisfied  that  there  was  a
    failure to take this evidence into account  and  that  such  error  was
    material.


    Decisions and Directions

24. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal contains errors of law and
    is set aside.


25. At the close of  submissions  I  reserved  my  decision.  Mr  Nicholson
    indicated that should the decision be set aside those  instructing  him
    would wish to make an application under Rule 15 (2A)  of  the  Tribunal
    Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules  2008  in  order  to  admit  further
    evidence as to the Appellant's mental health. Further evidence would be
    submitted in respect of the recent suicide attempt, and the psychiatric
    treatment she had been receiving since.  I indicated that if the matter
    required remaking I would admit such evidence. I therefore  give  leave
    for new evidence to be submitted, which must be  filed  and  served  no
    later than the 20th July 2016.


26. The appeal will be remade before me in  Manchester  at  a  date  to  be
    notified. It will be set down for a hearing time  of  2  hours  with  a
    Tamil interpreter; liberty to apply if either party considers that this
    time estimate is wrong.   The  Appellant  is  to  advise,  as  soon  as
    practicable,   the  Tribunal  and  Respondent  if  Ms  Dooley  or   any
    additional witnesses are to be called.

27. Having regard to the nature  of  the  evidence  I  make  the  following
    direction for anonymity, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1  of
    2013: Anonymity Orders.

        "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
        family.  This direction applies both to the Appellant  and  to  the
        Respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction  could  lead  to
        contempt of court proceedings".
