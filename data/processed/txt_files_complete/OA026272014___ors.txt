      Representation:

      For the appellants: Mr R. Jesurum (Counsel)
      For the respondent: Mr T. Wilding (Home Office Presenting Officer)



                            DECISION AND REASONS




   1. This is the appellants' appeal  against  the  decision  of  First-Tier
      Tribunal Judge McIntosh dated the 28th November 2014.

        Background




     2. The appellants are citizens of Nepal. Mr Santosh Pun  was  born  on
        the 13th July 1983. Mr Dipak Pun was  born  on  the  5th  September
        1988. Mr Dipendra Pun was born on the 14th April 1991.


     3. In November 2013 the appellants  applied  for  entry  clearance  to
        settle in the United Kingdom as  the  dependant  sons  of  Mr  Amar
        Badahur Pun, an ex Gurkha soldier and Mrs Lal Kumari  Pun.  On  the
        20th  January  2014  the   respondent   refused   the   appellants'
        application for entry clearance. The  appellants  appealed  to  the
        First-tier Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  and  that
        appeal was heard at  Taylor  House  by  First-Tier  Tribunal  Judge
        McIntosh on the 5th November 2014. It was  conceded  before  First-
        Tier Tribunal Judge McIntosh that the appellants did not  meet  the
        requirements of the Immigration Rules, but he went on  to  consider
        their claim in  accordance  with  Article  8  of  the  ECHR.  Judge
        McIntosh at paragraph 34 of his decision relied upon  the  case  of
        Ghising (family life-adults-Ghurkhas policy)  v  SSHD  [2012]  UKUT
        00160 (AIC), and went on to find that the appellants lived together
        as a family unit, and had two sisters who continued  to  reside  in
        Nepal with their respective families. He found that the  appellants
        had lived separately from their sponsor, their father, for  over  2
        years and each was over the age of 18. He found that there  was  no
        prejudice to the family life enjoyed by  the  appellants  and  that
        they were able to continue family life in Nepal with some financial
        support from her father and brother. He found the decisions in  the
        appellants' case did not breach their Human Rights under Article  8
        of the ECHR, in respect of their family life.



   4. The appellants appealed to the Upper Tribunal against that decision on
      the 17th January 2015.







     5. In the grounds  of  appeal,  it  was  argued  that  the  First-Tier
        Tribunal Judge misdirected himself wrong in  law  by  relying  upon
        paragraphs 2 and 3 of the headnote of the case of  Ghising  (family
        life-adults-Ghurkhas policy) v SSHD [2012] UKUT 160 (IAC) ("Ghising
        [2012]") at paragraph 34 of the decision and that the  correct  law
        was now set out in the cases of R (Gurung) v The Secretary of State
        for the Home Department [2013] 1 WLR 2546 and  Ghising  and  others
        (Ghurkhas/BOCs-historic  wrong-weight)  [2013]   UKUT   567   (IAC)
        ("Ghising [2013]"). It is argued that the historic injustice Gurkha
        cases require consideration as to whether not  family  life  exists
        between the sponsor and the adult children and that if it did, that
        would be a "strong reason" why  settlement  was  proportionate  and
        that the historic injustice will "normally require" a  decision  in
        the appellants' favour unless the respondent  relies  on  something
        more than "the ordinary interests of immigration control".   It  is
        argued that there was no finding on the issue as to whether or  not
        there was family life between the adult appellants and their father
        and mother, and that the First-Tier Tribunal Judge materially erred
        in law in applying the wrong law and failing to make findings on  a
        crucial matter.




   6. First-Tier Tribunal Judge Levin granted permission to  appeal  on  the
      4th March 2015, on the basis that there was an arguable failure by the
      First-Tier Tribunal Judge to make specific findings as to  whether  or
      not there were sufficient family life between the appellants  and  the
      sponsor so as to engage  Article  8  on  the  basis  of  family  life.
      Further, he found that it was arguable that the Judge's  citation  and
      reliance upon paragraphs 2 and 3 of the  headnote  of  Ghising  [2012]
      which had been overturned by the Court of Appeal in the case of R  (on
      the application of Sharmila Gurung and  others)  v  the  Secretary  of
      State for the Home  Department  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  8  amounted  to  an
      arguable error of law. It is on that basis the appeal comes before us.

        Error of Law




   7. As was properly conceded by Mr Wilding on behalf of the respondent, it
      is clear that at paragraph 34 of  his  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal
      Judge McIntosh did rely upon the wrong law when quoting  paragraphs  2
      and 3 of the headnote of the decision of the  Upper  Tribunal  in  the
      case of Ghising [2012] UKUT 00160 (AIC), despite those two  paragraphs
      of the headnote having been  overturned by the Court of Appeal in  the
      case of R (on the application of Sharmila Gurung  and  others)  v  The
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] 1 WLR 2546, in which
      the reasoning in Ghising [2012] that the impact of the historic  wrong
      on the balancing exercise performed under Article 8 (2) was  "limited"
      and as such carried "substantially less weight" than the impact of the
      historic wrong suffered by British Overseas Citizens, and that in most
      cases the public interest in having a firm and consistent  immigration
      policy would outweigh the historic injustice suffered by the Ghurkhas,
      was found to be wrong.




   8. The Court of Appeal in Gurung at paragraph 50 stated that "We  do  not
      consider that a judgement about the  egregiousness  of  the  injustice
      that was suffered by the Gurkhas as compared with that suffered by the
      BOCs should be  a  relevant  factor  in  the  balancing  exercise.  As
      submitted on behalf NR, Ghising and KR,  the  crucial  point  is  that
      there was an historic injustice in  both  cases,  the  consequence  of
      which was that members of both groups were prevented from settling  in
      the UK. That is why the historic injustice is such an important factor
      to be taken into  account  in  the  balancing  exercise  and  why  the
      applicant dependant child of a Gurkha settled in the  UK  has  such  a
      strong  claim  to  have  his   article   8   (1)   right   vindicated,
      notwithstanding the potency of the countervailing public  interest  in
      the maintaining of a firm immigration policy. There is no place in the
      balancing exercise for  making  fine  judgements  as  to  whether  one
      injustice  is  more  worthy  of  condemnation   than   another.   Such
      judgements, (which would in any event be difficult to  weigh)  may  be
      relevant in the political plane. They are not relevant to  the  making
      of decisions as to whether it is proportionate to  interfere  with  an
      individual's Article 8 (1) rights.".




   9. The Upper Tribunal in the case of Ghising and others  (Ghurkhas/BOCs:-
      historic wrong; weight) [2013] UKUT 00567 (AIC) found that in the case
      of Ghurkhas, as in the case of BOCs, the historic  wrong  suffered  by
      Gurkha ex-servicemen should be given substantial weight and that where
      it is found that Article 8 is  engaged,  and,  but  for  the  historic
      wrong, the appellant would have been settled  in  the  United  Kingdom
      long ago, this will ordinarily determine the outcome of the Article  8
      proportionality  assessment  in  the  appellant's  favour,  where  the
      matters relied on by the Secretary of  State/Entry  Clearance  Officer
      consist  solely  of  the  public  interest  in  maintaining   a   firm
      immigration policy. It was further found that if  the  respondent  can
      point to matters over and above the public interest in  maintaining  a
      firm immigration policy, which are in favour of removal or refusal  of
      leave to enter, these matters must be  given  appropriate  weight  and
      balance  in  the  respondent's  favour  and  that  therefore   a   bad
      immigration history and/or criminal record may still be sufficient  to
      outweigh the powerful factors bearing on the appellant's side  of  the
      balance.




  10. Although Mr Wilding accepted that the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  had
      misdirected himself  in  law  as  identified  above,  he  nevertheless
      submitted that such error was not material because it related  to  the
      issue of proportionality and the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  correctly
      concluded that the appellants do not share a family life with their UK-
      based parents. In support of this submission the Tribunal's  attention
      was drawn to paragraphs 35 and 38 of the decision. It was particularly
      argued that  it  could  be  implied  from  the  Judge's  reasoning  in
      paragraph 36 of the determination  that  he  had  concluded  that  the
      appellants had not, respectively, established that they are engaged in
      a family life with their parents.




  11. However, upon being pressed by the Tribunal Mr Wilding  accepted  that
      even if the finding on family life could be implied into paragraph 36,
      and for the sake of completeness we have no hesitation  in  concluding
      that it cannot, the Judge failed to provide adequate reasons for  such
      conclusion. He further properly conceded that if family life was found
      to exist between the appellants and their parents, then their  appeals
      ought to be allowed given (i) the terms of  the  decision  in  Ghising
      [2013] and (ii) the positive credibility finding made by the Judge  at
      paragraph 39 of the decision.




  12. Given the proper concessions made  on  behalf  of  the  respondent  we
      conclude that the  First-tier  Tribunal's  determination  contains  an
      error of law capable of affecting the outcome of the  appeal  and  we,
      accordingly, set such determination aside.




        Re-making of the decision on the appeal




  13. The only matter left in dispute before us is whether any, and each, of
      the appellants can establish  that,  as  of  the  date  of  the  Entry
      Clearance Officer's decision, they shared a family life with their UK-
      based parents. If this can be established, and Article 8  is  engaged,
      then following the rationale of the decisions in  Gurung  and  Ghising
      [2013],  as  recognised  by  the  concession  of   Mr   Wilding,   the
      interference with the appellants' family lives, by refusing them entry
      clearance, would be disproportionate.




  14. Mr Jesurum observed that in respect of the issue as to whether  family
      life existed between the appellants and their parents, the Judge found
      both the appellants and their witnesses credible at  paragraph  39  of
      the decision. He referred us to his skeleton argument that was  before
      the First-tier Tribunal Judge. He  argued  that  what  constitutes  an
      extant family life falls well short of dependency following the  Court
      of Appeal case of Patel and others v Entry Clearance Officer  (Mumbai)
      [2010] EWCA Civ 17 and that simply because the appellants had obtained
      the age of majority did not end family life  between  them  and  their
      parents. He argued that the appellants are still living in the  family
      home and had not established independent families  of  their  own.  He
      argued that the appellants were residing with their father and  mother
      until the long delayed grant of settlement to  their  father  and  the
      whole family demonstrated a continuing intention  to  maintain  family
      unity, frustrated only by the delayed grant of settlement.  He  argued
      that the appellants are financially dependent upon the sponsor and are
      also dependent upon the father's support for providing  accommodation.
      Mr Jesurum argued that the parents were close to  the  appellants  and
      that they speak to each every other day by telephone.




  15. Mr Jesurum therefore argued that following  the  case  of  Kugathas  v
      Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA  Civ  31,  that
      the relationship between the appellants and  their  parents  was  more
      than the normal emotional ties existing  between  adult  children  and
      their parents, such that Article 8 was engaged. Mr Jesurum argued that
      if the only weight on the public interest side of the balance was  the
      interest of immigration control, then the weight to be  given  to  the
      historic injustice will normally require a decision in the appellants'
      favour, following the Upper Tribunal's decision in the case of Ghising
      others (Ghurkhas/BOCs-historic wrong-weight) [2013] UKUT 567. He asked
      us to allow the appeal.

  16. Turning to our consideration of the issue of family  life.  We  remind
      ourselves that Judge McIntosh found the appellants and their witnesses
      to be consistent and credible in their  evidence.  The  evidence  from
      their father, Mr Amar Badahur Pun in his statement dated 23rd  October
      2013 at paragraph 6, states specifically that if he had  been  allowed
      to settle in the United Kingdom in 1983, he would have done so and his
      sons would have been born in the United Kingdom and  would  have  been
      British citizens, or have been naturalised soon  thereafter.  He  also
      went on to state at paragraph 7 of his statement  that  his  sons  are
      completely dependent upon himself and his wife. He  explained  how  he
      sends money of between �100 and �200 to his sons every 2 to 3  months,
      as they have no other form of income.




  17. Further, the appellants themselves in their joint statement, state  at
      paragraph 7 that their parents are a central part of their family  and
      that they remain heavily financially and  emotionally  dependent  upon
      them and that their parents have always been there  to  support  them.
      The appellants say they are a close  family  unit  and  they  did  not
      intend to be separated for so long. At paragraph 10 they confirm  that
      their parents send them money regularly. At  paragraph  9  they  state
      that they are in regular contact via telephone  and  at  paragraph  10
      they say that they receive support from the  parents  to  cover  their
      education fees, living expenses and accommodation costs.




  18. In his statement dated the 22 October 2014, Mr Amar Pun at paragraph 5
      also confirmed that all the sons are not married and  are  financially
      dependent upon him  and  his  wife.  He  explained  that  Santosh  and
      Dipendra will continue their studies and that Dipak  is  not  able  to
      find work. He stated that they still live in the family  home  in  the
      village, or in a rented room in Kathmandu when  Santosh  and  Dipendra
      are studying and that he continues to send money transfers to his sons
      to cover their education fees and living expenses.




  19. Mrs Lal Pun, the appellants' mother, in her statement dated  the  29th
      October 2014, again confirms the financial,  practical  and  emotional
      support given to her three sons and how she and husband are in contact
      every other day with them using Lebara mobiles. She states that  is  a
      constant struggle for them all to be separated  in  this  way,  whilst
      they await the appellants' applications to be granted.




  20. All of the evidence of the appellants and their witnesses was accepted
      as  credible  by  First-tier  Tribunal  McIntosh,  whose   credibility
      findings we have preserved. On the  basis  of  the  accepted  evidence
      before us we conclude that the nature of the relationship between  the
      appellants and their parents as described above amounts  to  a  family
      life for the purposes of Article 8 ECHR.




  21. In coming to the aforementioned conclusion, we have borne in mind  and
      applied the law as it is set out in paragraphs 48 to 62 of  the  Upper
      Tribunal's decision in Ghising [2012], which was not disturbed by  the
      Court of Appeal in its decision in Gurung.







  22. We note that as was stated by Lord  Justice  Sedley  in  the  case  of
      Kugathas v the Secretary of State for the Home Department [2003]  EWCA
      Civ 31, that in order for  there  to  be  family  life  between  adult
      children and their parents, for the purpose of Article 8,  there  have
      to be elements of dependency involving more than the normal  emotional
      ties between an adult child and their parents, and that dependency  is
      not limited  to  economic  dependency,  but  means  "support"  in  the
      personal sense, in the form  of  "real",  "committed"  or  "effective"
      support.




  23.  It  is  significant  in  this  case  that  the  appellants  have  not
      established an independent family life, but are all still  single  and
      still all live together in the family home or in accommodation  rented
      by their father in Kathmandu when Santosh and Dipendra  are  studying.
      We further bear in mind that they all lived with their  parents  until
      they were separated after the grant of leave to their parents. We also
      accept and find as a fact that all three  appellants  are  financially
      dependent upon their parents for both  their  maintenance  and  living
      accommodation. We also accept and find the fact  that  the  appellants
      are in a close-knit family relationship with their  parents  and  that
      they do speak together on telephone every other day. We do accept that
      the appellants depend upon their parents for support and affection and
      that their parents provide therefore not only financial  support,  but
      also practical and emotional support, as stated by Mrs Pun.




  24. We find that although there had been an interruption to  their  family
      life by the appellants not being granted leave  to  enter  the  United
      Kingdom, they do remain financially  and  emotionally  dependent  upon
      their parents and that the ties between them do  therefore  go  beyond
      the normal emotional ties between adult children and their parents and
      we accept  that  normal  family  life  will  be  resumed  between  the
      appellants and their parents if the appellants are able to come to the
      United Kingdom to settle.  In  such  circumstances  we  consider  that
      Article 8 is engaged-the consequences of  the  interference  with  the
      appellants' family lives by the ECO's  decision  being  of  sufficient
      severity to lead us to such conclusion.

  25. Turning to the issue of proportionality, it has not been argued by  Mr
      Wilding, quite properly, that there are any factors in this case which
      count in the respondent's favour, or  weigh  against  the  appellants,
      other than the weight to  be  attributed  to  the  maintenance  of  an
      effective immigration control, and in such circumstances, we find,  in
      light of the decision of the Upper  Tribunal  in  Ghising  and  Others
      (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong: weight) [2013] UKUT  00567,  that  the
      historic injustice in this case does  determine  the  outcome  of  the
      Article 8 proportionality assessment in the appellants' favour,  given
      that the only matter relied upon the by the respondent consists of the
      public interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy and that, had
      he been allowed to do so, the appellants' father, Mr  Amar  Pun  would
      have settled in the UK long ago and that the appellants  would  either
      have been born as British citizens or would have been naturalised long
      ago.




  26. We have borne in mind in  considering  the  proportionality  balancing
      exercise under Article 8 the provisions of sections  117  A-D  of  the
      Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and have borne  in  mind
      that the maintenance of an effective immigration  control  is  in  the
      public interest  and  that  it  is  in  the  public  interest  and  in
      particular in the interests of the economic well-being of  the  United
      Kingdom that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
      are able to speak English and  are  financially  independent,  because
      persons who can speak English are less of a burden  on  taxpayers  and
      are  better  able  to  integrate  into  society  and  those  who   are
      financially independent are not a burden on taxpayers and  are  better
      able to integrate into society. We have also borne  in  mind  in  this
      regard that the appellants themselves are able to speak  English,  but
      that they are dependent financially upon their parents.




  27. However, we regard section 117A-D as setting out matters that have  to
      be borne in mind by the Tribunal when considering the public  interest
      element in the proportionality exercise, and that the introduction  of
      this section does not  amount  to  a  redressing  of  the  balance  in
      historic Gurkha injustice cases from that set out within  Ghising  and
      Others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic wrong: weight) [2013] UKUT  00567.  It
      was, quite properly, not argued by Mr Wilding,  that  section  117A-D,
      could have any effect on the outcome of this case.




  28. The appellants' appeals are therefore allowed on Human Rights  grounds
      in respect of their family life under Article 8.



      Notice of Decision

      The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  contained  material
      errors of law and is set aside. The decision is remade  allowing  each
      of the appellants' appeals on the basis that the ECO's decision led to
      a breach of Article 8 of the ECHR.

      The First-Tier Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to Rule  13  of
      the Tribunal Procedure (First-Tier Tribunal) (Immigration  and  Asylum
      Chamber) Rules 2014, and no application for  an  anonymity  order  was
