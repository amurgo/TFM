For the Appellant:           Mr Holmes, Counsel instructed by Thornhills
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Pakistan born in 1988.  He appeals  with
    permission against the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge
    Brooks) to dismiss his appeal under the Immigration (European  Economic
    Area) Regulations 2016.
 2. It was the Appellant's case before the First-tier Tribunal that he  had
    acquired a 'derivative' right of residence under Regulation 16  of  the
    Regs because he is the primary carer for a British citizen who would be
    "unable to reside in the United Kingdom or another EEA  state"  if  the
    Appellant were to leave the United Kingdom.


 3. The British citizen concerned is the Appellant's brother, A.   I return
    to the medical evidence in more detail below but at present it suffices
    to note that  A  has  been  diagnosed  with  various  conditions  which
    severely restrict his mobility, including spinal stenosis, lumbar  disc
    degeneration, disc prolapse and neurological functioning  disorder.  He
    avers that the Appellant is his primary carer, upon whom he is entirely
    dependent.  Part of A's evidence concerned his difficulties during  the
    night. His spinal problems mean that he  often  loses  control  of  his
    bladder and wets his bedding; in his sleep his body can  get  numb  and
    freezes in one position. It is his brother who cleans him  and  manages
    this paralysis by moving his position and massaging the affected  areas
    until sensation returns. Without this attention, A says, he  would  not
    be able to manage. In his statement he gives a number  of  examples  of
    accidents that resulted from this  temporary  paralysis  in  the  past,
    which resulted in the emergency services being called.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal, and indeed the  Respondent,  accepted  that  A
    suffers from the various medical conditions outlined in the  voluminous
    medical evidence in this  case.    It  was  further  accepted  that  at
    present, the Appellant does in fact live with A and that he  cares  for
    him. The appeal was however dismissed  under  the  Regulations  on  the
    grounds that the care given by the Appellant could be  given  by  other
    people [�25]. The Tribunal considered that the issue of night-time care
    was "key" but that the evidence given on that matter had come from  the
    Appellant and A, rather than independent medical assessment [�27].   It
    was not therefore prepared, for instance, to accept the evidence of the
    family GP Dr Francis, because in the First-tier Tribunal's  estimation,
    Dr Francis was simply repeating what she had been told.   The  Tribunal
    concluded that whilst it was A's preference to have  his  brother  care
    for him, that was not the appropriate test.   The  First-tier  Tribunal
    then says this [at its �32]:


         "Following MS Malaysia availability of care is a relative  but  not
         always a decisive factor. I must also  examine  the  character  and
         quality of the relationship of dependency between the  sponsor  and
         appellant. The sponsor states that if his brother  cannot  continue
         to care for him, he will have no choice but  to  leave  the  United
         Kingdom.  However,  the  sponsors  evidence  that  he  would   feel
         compelled to leave cannot be conclusive of the issue of whether  on
         an objective basis the sponsor would be compelled to leave"

    Concluding that in fact A could pay privately for care,  and  that  the
    evidence adduced in  support  of  the  claim  was  "not  credible"  the
    Tribunal dismissed the appeal.


      The Grounds

 5. The Appellant submits that the determination of the First-tier Tribunal
    is materially flawed for the following reasons:


              i) Failure to take relevant evidence into account


                 The evidence before the First-tier Tribunal  from  Bradford
                 Social Services was that A would not  be  provided  with  a
                 night-time carer since his needs were not time-specific (ie
                 social services were not prepared to pay  for  a  carer  to
                 spend the night in the house every night just in case A wet
                 the bed or suffered from temporary paralysis). Evidence was
                 further adduced  that  night-time  care  from  the  private
                 sector was prohibitively expensive for A and  that  he  had
                 been advised that the only realistic solution would  be  to
                 live in a care home at the minimum cost of �5000 per month.
                  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  does  not  engage
                 with that evidence.


             ii) Irrationality


                 It is submitted that there was no rational reason to reject
                 the evidence of the GP about the extent  of  A's  needs  at
                 night.  First,  there  was  no  evidential  basis  for  the
                 conclusion that the doctor was just repeating what she  had
                 been told; she was a medical professional  with  access  to
                 all of the relevant records.  Second the Tribunal here took
                 a point that was not taken by the Respondent: even  if  the
                 doctor's evidence was based on  'self-reporting'  that  was
                 irrelevant given  that  the  Secretary  of  State  did  not
                 challenge A's evidence about his ongoing difficulties.





    Findings on 'Error of Law'

 6. I can here be brief since Mr Diwnycz  did  not  resist  either  of  the
    grounds I set out above.


 7. In respect of ground (i), the Tribunal was  correct  to  say  that  the
    issue of night-time care was "key". In fact it mattered little  whether
    social services or private providers were able  to  provide  assistance
    during the day if A was still left alone at  night.   The  evidence  of
    Bradford  Social  Services,  in  their  'Social  Care   and   Wellbeing
    Assessment' dated 14th September  2018  was  unequivocal:  A  had  been
    advised that they could not provide a carer to spend the  entire  night
    with him, and that their night-time provision  was  limited  to  "time-
    specific" appointments. This was, as I have set out above, no good to A
    because he cannot predict when he is going to need someone there.  I am
    accordingly satisfied that  the  failure  to  take  into  account  this
    element of Bradford's assessment was material.

 8. Ground (ii) is also made out.   The submissions of the HOPO are set out
    at paragraphs 7-10 of the decision. It is clear from this that  it  was
    not part of the Respondent's case to challenge the evidence as  to  the
    medical needs of A.    Nor  was  Dr  Francis'  integrity  or  expertise
    impugned.  If the Tribunal found reason to disbelieve A, and indeed  Dr
    Francis, about his overnight care needs, then that  point  should  have
    been put to him  to  enable  him  to  respond.  In  truth  reading  the
    determination I am at a loss to understand what that reason might  have
    been.   I am sure that the Tribunal did not intend this to be the case,
    but one is left with the impression that the witnesses were disbelieved
    simply because  they  were  not  "independent".  Unless  there  was  an
    identifiable reason to reject the unchallenged evidence of  Dr  Francis
    and A about the pain and distress  he  suffers  during  the  night,  it
    should logically have attracted some weight.



    The Re-Made Decision

 9. The relevant  part  of  Regulation  16  of  the  Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 reads as follows:


         16.- (1) A person has a derivative  right  to  reside  during  any
         period in which the person-

                 (a) is not an exempt person; and

                 (b) satisfies each of the criteria in one or more of
            paragraphs (2) to (6).

           ...

            (5) The criteria in this paragraph are that-

                 (a) the person is the primary carer of a British citizen
              ("BC");

                 (b) BC is residing in the United Kingdom; and

                 (c) BC would be unable to reside in the United Kingdom or
                 in another EEA State if the person left the United Kingdom
                 for an indefinite period.



10. There is no dispute that the Appellant is  the  primary  carer  for  A.
    This much was accepted by the First-tier  Tribunal  and  indeed  by  Mr
    Diwnycz before me. I am accordingly satisfied that the Appellant  meets
    the requirements of Regulation 16 (5) (a).


11. A resides in the United Kingdom. I  am  satisfied  that  the  Appellant
    meets the requirements of Regulation 16(5)(b).

12. The only matter remaining is whether the A would be unable to reside in
    the United Kingdom or in another EEA state if the  Appellant  left  the
    United Kingdom for an indefinite period.

13. A himself is unequivocal in his written  and  oral  evidence:  that  he
    would have no choice but to leave the United Kingdom, and therefore the
    EEA, if the Appellant were to return to Pakistan.    His  position  can
    be summarised as follows:

              i) He has significant and complex medical needs.  The combined
                 effects of his spinal problems are that he is confined to a
                 wheelchair; he can suffer intermittently from  incontinence
                 and a numbness in his body which leaves him unable to  move
                 unaided; he needs personal care  in  washing  and  dressing
                 himself.  He has also suffered neurological damage  to  one
                 side of his brain, depression and anxiety; when his brother
                 was refused a residence card he felt so "hopeless" that  he
                 tried to end his own life by taking an overdose.  He  takes
                 a number of strong medications which affect  his  diet  and
                 cause significant side effects including drowsiness.


             ii) If his brother were to return to Pakistan  he  may  receive
                 some care assistance during  the  day  (either  by  way  of
                 Bradford Social Services or private provision) but the real
                 difficulty arises at night. Bradford have stated that  they
                 will not pay for such provision and A cannot afford to  pay
                 privately. He has been advised that  the  most  appropriate
                 setting for providing his night-time care needs would be  a
                 home. Private care homes cost in the region  of  �5000-6000
                 per month. A does not want to live in  a  home  and  cannot
                 afford this much money.  The alternative  would  be  paying
                 privately for night-time care, but this costs approximately
                 �17 per hour and again is unaffordable.


            iii) A already has experience of trying to live  in  the  United
                 Kingdom without the assistance of any family  member  -  he
                 recounts the difficulties he had in trying to  move  around
                 his home unaided and  the  problems  he  experienced  being
                 dependent  on  carers  provided  by  social  services.   He
                 suffered a number of accidents in the home including on one
                 occasion when he suffered a  numbness  episode  leading  to
                 paralysis: he was unable to move to let paramedics  in  and
                 had to wait 5 hours for the police and fire crews to arrive
                 to force entry so that he could receive assistance.


             iv) A has a meaningful private life in the United  Kingdom.  He
                 serves as  a  Local  Councillor  in  his  neighbourhood  in
                 Yorkshire and  is  also  the  Disability  Officer  for  his
                 Constituency Labour  Party.   In  order  to  perform  these
                 community/political roles he is entirely dependent  on  his
                 brother, who takes him to and from  meetings  and  surgery,
                 helps him manage his diary and generally acts as his unpaid
                 personal assistant.

              v) If his brother were to return to Pakistan, A would  not  be
                 able to continue  with  his  community/political  work.  He
                 simply cannot afford to  pay  for  personal  assistant/full
                 time carer to help him cope with these roles.

             vi) Apart  from  the  Appellant  all  of  A's  family  live  in
                 Pakistan. His parents and two sisters live in  Taxila.  His
                 father is a retired civil servant and receives a pension so
                 whilst they are not wealthy, they  are  comfortable.   Both
                 the Appellant and A could be  accommodated  in  the  family
                 home, where other family members could assist the Appellant
                 in caring for A.

            vii) Taking all of that into account A sees no  alternative  but
                 to leave the United Kingdom and return to Pakistan with his
                 brother. He does not wish to remain in the  United  Kingdom
                 if he is in effect confined to either a care  home  or  his
                 own home.

14. A's medical history is  set  out  in  a  number  of  documents  in  the
    evidence: a letter  of  the  25th  September  2018  from  Mr  S  Patil,
    Consultant in Spinal Injuries and  Rehabilitation,  letters  dated  the
    16th April 2018, 19th May 2019 and 24th July 2019 from Dr M Francis  of
    Bingley Medical  Practice,  a  Social  Care  and  Wellbeing  Assessment
    conducted by Bradford Social Services on the  14th  September  2018,  a
    letter dated the 13th May 2019 from Dr Charlene Thwaites of the Airdale
    NHS Trust and the report of Consultant Clinical Psychologist  Professor
    R. Skinner dated the 24th June 2019. I note that all of the  clinicians
    and professionals who have provided evidence refer to the Appellant  as
    A's main carer.


15. The background to A's current difficulties is  as  follows.  He  was  a
    healthy and able-bodied man who in 2008 started experiencing  low  back
    pain, accompanied by sudden  onset  weakness  in  the  legs.    He  was
    subsequently diagnosed with  spinal  stenosis,  a  prolapsed  disc  and
    lumbar disc degeneration. He underwent spinal surgery but  in  2013  he
    was involved in a road traffic accident which left him incontinent  and
    a catheter had to be fitted; the "unpredictable onset of  weakness"  in
    his legs returned.   He  was  subsequently  diagnosed  with  Functional
    Neurological Disorder. A's GP  Dr  Francis  describes  him  has  having
    "severe mobility problems", and states that he can suffer  from  severe
    pain and  numbness  in  his  limbs  which  mean  that  he  can  require
    assistance  with  his  "daily  activities  including  preparing   food,
    dressing, toileting and bathing.  He has a significant stutter and  has
    some difficulty communicating. He also reports significant fatigue as a
    side effect  of  his  medication".   Dr  Francis  and  Bradford  Social
    Services both note the unpredictable nature of A's difficulties. He  is
    able to stand, but his legs can quickly become numb and 'go' from under
    him.  He has suffered a number of falls as a result.  He now  does  not
    go out alone.


16. Bradford Social Services record that A needs to go to the  toilet  five
    or six times during  the  night,  and  that  he  suffers  unpredictable
    episodes of numbness where his body becomes "locked". The report notes:

         "[A] requested night care support and rang  the  access  team  last
         year to get support for night time carers but  was  told  that  our
         service is time specific and [A] is wanting to have  someone  there
         throughout the night in case he needs support and  was  advised  to
         purchase this service privately I reiterated this and [A] has  said
         he understood but he cannot afford to  employ  private  care  seven
         nights a week. [The Appellant] has been providing this  support  in
         this remit since he has been in the UK"


17. As referred to above, the Secretary of State has not to date challenged
    A's evidence about the difficulties he faces at night; I  add  for  the
    sake of completeness that the bundles also contained a letter from  A's
    ex-wife who refers to these episodes herself and how she would have  to
    stay awake during the night to make sure that he was comfortable.   The
    couple were divorced in 2018 - the marital breakdown  being  attributed
    in part to her  exhaustion  in  caring  for  A  -  and  she  has  since
    remarried.


18. Dr Francis confirms A's evidence about his  mental  health  issues  and
    that his significant low mood left him suicidal for a period.  This  is
    further repeated by Clinical Psychologist Dr  Charlene  Thwaites.   The
    report of Consultant Clinical Psychologist Professor R. Skinner  refers
    in turn to additional reports dated between 2016 and 2019 from a Neuro-
    psychiatrist and a Spinal Injuries Consultant  confirming  the  history
    given by Dr Francis.  In his very brief report Professor Skinner opines
    that A is at risk of relapsing into a severe depression should he  have
    to give up his current roles in local government and the Labour Party.


19.  Other  documentary  evidence  provided  in  support  of  A's  evidence
    includes:

              i) Bank statements showing regular payments of EESA  from  the
                 DWP;


             ii) His father's pension book;


            iii) A letter from John  Brazendale,  Bingley  Town  Councillor,
                 confirming that he knows A and that at all meetings  etc  A
                 is accompanied by the Appellant. Mr Brazendale says  it  is
                 clear to him that A depends on his brother for his  day  to
                 day care needs;


             iv) Further letters from Ros Dawson, the Chair of Bingley  Town
                 Council, and Councillors Ashraf Miah  and  John  Goode  who
                 confirm the same;


              v) Correspondence between  A  and  various  professional  care
                 providers showing that he  has  made  enquiries  about  the
                 possibility of obtaining night-time care. 22 companies give
                 various reasons why they are unable to assist. Alchita Care
                 Ltd quote for a live-in care package of �1250 per week or a
                 night-time carer rate of �18.50  per  hour.  Care  Dynamics
                 offer care at �16.24 per hour which goes up  to  �24.36  on
                 bank holidays. Care Mark will charge �17.00  per  hour  for
                 experienced night-care workers. A has  also  found  a  care
                 home specialising in the care of the under-65s with  spinal
                 injury: Staveley Birkleas charge a  basic  weekly  rate  of
                 �1088 which does not include the �15.00 per hour that would
                 be charged on top if A needed someone to accompany  him  on
                 trips out of the home.  Similar figures are  given  by  the
                 Hales Group who alternatively could provide a  night  carer
                 at �17 per hour.

20. I have taken all of that evidence into account.


21. The concern expressed by the  First-tier  Tribunal  was  that  A  would
    simply prefer the  care  he  needs  to  be  provided  by  his  brother.
    Reference is made  to  his  evidence  that  he  did  not  have  a  good
    experience of care provided by Bradford before his  brother's  arrival:
    carers did not arrive as scheduled, he was  uncomfortable  with  female
    carers etc.  I note however that the "relevant care package"  that  the
    Tribunal believed would be available to A should the  Appellant  depart
    was, on Bradford Social Services' own evidence, only  available  during
    the day. A has been advised in no uncertain  terms  that  the  kind  of
    night-time care he requires is simply not available in the home:  as  I
    understand it the point is that the council would pay for  a  carer  to
    come to the house between say 2am and 3am, but this is no  good  for  A
    because he does not know when he might wet himself or become unable  to
    move.


22. The alternative is that A find the �17 per hour needed  to  pay  for  a
    private carer.   Assuming that this carer would be on  duty  from,  say
    10pm 'til 7am in the morning, this amounts to  �1071  per  week.    The
    First-tier Tribunal, presumably accepting  that  A's  income  currently
    consists mostly of DWP benefits, suggested that A  could  look  to  his
    paternal uncle for this money, a man  who  lives  in  Pakistan  and  is
    "financially very strong".   There is absolutely no evidence before  me
    that this uncle could or would find c�4500 per month  to  pay  for  his
    nephew's care in the United Kingdom.

23. I am satisfied that in  respect  of  his  physical  care  needs,  A  is
    dependent upon his brother, and that if that care was removed  A  would
    find himself in serious difficulty during the night.   He would have to
    wait until carers arrived in the morning to clean him and help  him  to
    move. If he found himself unable to move in the night he  may  have  to
    call the emergency services as he has done in the past.  During the day
    he may receive in-home care but his ability to continue his involvement
    in  public  life  -  the  essence  of  his  private  life  -  would  be
    substantially reduced, dependent upon his ability to pay privately  for
    carers to accompany him  to  meetings  etc.    Having  heard  his  oral
    evidence I am wholly satisfied  that  A  does  not  regard  this  as  a
    feasible option for himself.

24. This is not a case where the British national is heavily dependent upon
    the medical treatment he receives in the United Kingdom (cf. Ayinde and
    Thinjom (Carers - Reg.15A - Zambrano) [2015] UKUT 00560 (IAC)). In this
    case his care consists primarily of day-to-day assistance and  personal
    attention provided by a close family member. I am wholly satisfied that
    as a matter of fact A would consider himself unable to  remain  in  the
    United Kingdom in the absence of that  care.   Given  the  consequences
    that he would face should he 'choose'  to  remain,  his  conclusion  is
    perfectly understandable.  In Pakistan he will have  the  care  of  his
    brother, his sisters and parents, and will be able to live  comfortably
    in the family home. In this country he will be confined  to  his  home,
    and would have to give up most, if not all, of the work  and  community
    activism that he currently finds so important; he  will  have  to  face
    each night with trepidation, knowing that he may well end up soiled  or
    in an ambulance.  I am satisfied that the  Appellant  has  demonstrated
    that he meets the criteria in Regulation 16(5)(c).

25. I note for  the  sake  of  completeness  that  on  the  very  day  that
    permission was granted in this  matter  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Keane (the 16th December 2019) the Supreme Court has  handed  down  its
    decision in Patel (FC) v Secretary of State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2019] UKSC 59. Whilst primarily concerned with whether  a  distinction
    should be drawn between Chavez-Vilchez children and  adult  dependents,
    the Court generally reviewed the principles  applicable  in  derivative
    rights cases. Two points relevant to this decision arise.

26. First, that the court  cited  with  approval  the  dicta  in  the  CJEU
    decision of KA v Belgium (Case C-82/16) [2018] 3 CMLR 28:

         "where the Union citizen is an adult, a relationship of dependency,
         capable of justifying  the  grant  to  the  third-country  national
         concerned of a derived right of residence under article 20 TFEU, is
         conceivable only in exceptional cases, where, in the light  of  all
         the  relevant  circumstances,  any  form  of  separation   of   the
         individual concerned from the member of his family on  whom  he  is
         dependent is not possible"


    For the reasons I have set out above, I am satisfied that this is  such
    an exceptional case.  The objective reality underpinning  A's  'choice'
    is that should the care provided by his brother be removed, he would be
    far better off in Pakistan than he would be here, where he legitimately
    fears a deterioration in his mental health and physical neglect.

27. Second, the Court underlined that the  compulsion  test  in  Regulation
    16(5)(c) must be applied in a practical way. The term  "unable"  should
    not be interpreted to mean that it is physically impossible for the EEA
    national to remain in the country. It is a question of fact, of whether
    the individual concerned would in reality  leave  with  his  carer  [at
    �32]:


         " In those circumstances I consider that the Court of  Appeal  made
         an error of law when it treated as determinative what could  happen
         to Mr and Mrs Shah's son if the father left  the  UK,  rather  than
         what the FTT had found would happen in that event. In other  words,
         it was not open in law to the Court of Appeal to hold that Mr  Shah
         had no derivative right  of  residence  because  the  mother  could
         remain with the child in the UK even if the father was removed".

     [emphasis added]. Here, there obviously is an option for A  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom  without  his  brother:  no  matter  how  lonely,
    physically challenging and restricted that life would be, he  could  do
    it.  The fact remains that he would not.



    Anonymity Order

28. Having had regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)
    Rules 2008 and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity
    Orders I am satisfied that the identification of the appellant in  this
    case  would  lead  to  the  identification  of   his   brother,   whose
    confidential medical history is discussed herein. I therefore  consider
    it appropriate to make an order in the following terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member  of  his
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"





    Decision

29. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for material error
    of law.


30. I remake the decision by allowing  the  appeal  under  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016.


31. There is an order for anonymity.
