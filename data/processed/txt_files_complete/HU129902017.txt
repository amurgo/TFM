Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Brissett (Legal Representative)
For the Respondent:    Mr Tarlow (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. This is the Appellant's appeal against  the  decision  of  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Russell promulgated on the 8th August 2018.

    2. Within his decision, First-tier Tribunal Judge Russell did not accept
       that the Appellant was not in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship
       with Ms [JB] and that further there would  not  be  very  significant
       difficulties for the Appellant  to  reintegrate  back  into  life  in
       Jamaica, such that the Judge found that there was not a breach of the
       Appellant's Human Rights under Article 8 in  respect  of  either  his
       family life or private life, were he to be returned.

    3. The Appellant now seeks to  appeal  against  that  decision  for  the
       reasons set out within the Grounds of Appeal.  That is  a  matter  of
       record and is therefore not repeated in its  entirety  here,  but  in
       summary, it is argued both in the original grounds  and  the  renewed
       grounds of appeal that the  Judge  failed  to  take  account  of  two
       crucial pieces of evidence contained within the  Appellant's  bundle,
       the first being evidence that the Appellant and Ms [B]  were  engaged
       and had been prayed over at an engagement ceremony at their place  of
       worship and secondly, that Ms [B] had  stood  as  a  surety  for  the
       Appellant for the sum of �1,000, when he had made an  application  to
       be released on bail.

    4. Although permission to appeal was  initially  refused  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Beale, permission was then granted by  Upper  Tribunal
       Judge Perkins on the 19th December 2018, who found that  the  grounds
       identified two pieces  of  evidence  which  arguably  warranted  more
       detailed contention than a generic assurance by  the  Judge  that  he
       considered  all  the  evidence,  comprising  a  detailed   supporting
       statement from the leadership of the church  the  Appellant  and  his
       alleged partner claimed to attend, and  secondly  evidence  that  the
       Appellant was bailed to reside with his claimed partner in  2015  and
       that it could be a matter of grave concern if they were not  in  fact
       then living at  the  same  address.   Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Perkins
       therefore gave permission to appeal on all grounds.

    5. Within the Secretary of State's Rule 24 Reply dated the  9th  January
       2019 it is argued the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  directed  himself
       appropriately  and  neither  piece  of  documentary  evidence  either
       individually or cumulatively could have displaced the adverse  points
       found against the Appellant in respect of  his  claimed  relationship
       with his  partner.   It  is  said  of  note  was  a  failure  by  the
       Appellant's mother  to  provide  any  supporting  statement  to  that
       effect.  It is said that in any event even if the  relationship  were
       genuine it was formed at a time when the Appellant had  no  leave  to
       remain and was in highly precarious circumstances, a point said to be
       noted by the Judge in the alternative at paragraph 29.  It is  argued
       both the Appellant and his partner were both of Jamaican heritage and
       the Appellant had not demonstrated he had no links  or  ties  to  his
       home country and had spent the majority of his  life  there.   It  is
       said his partner was in gainful employment and that there was nothing
       in the facts of the appeal that could have lead the Tribunal to  find
       there were insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  in
       Jamaica or in the alternative that exceptional circumstances  existed
       when refusal of leave to remain would  lead  to  unjustifiably  harsh
       consequences when considering the strong public interest in the case.

    6. At the oral appeal hearing before me, Mr Brissett on  behalf  of  the
       Appellant submitted that credibility was the heart of the appeal  and
       whether  or  not  the  Appellant  was   in   a   genuine   subsisting
       relationship.  He argued that had the Judge considered  the  evidence
       from Senior Pastor Lovel Bent, that the Judge may well have reached a
       different conclusion  and  that  Ms  [B]  stood  as  surety  for  the
       Appellant and one would not stand as surety unless one  knew  someone
       very well.  He also mentioned that he had been bailed to live at  her
       address.

    7. In his oral submissions in reply, Mr Tarlow relied upon the  Rule  24
       Reply which I have already noted and taken into account.  However  he
       conceded that from  the  Judge's  decision,  it  could  not  be  said
       specifically that the Judge had taken account of  the  evidence  from
       the Pastor or the documentation regarding the Appellant  having  been
       bailed and his bail  conditions,  looking  at  paragraph  22  of  the
       decision.  He conceded that there was an  error  in  that  the  Judge
       seemingly did not properly consider  those  two  material  pieces  of
       evidence, but argued that the error was not material.

    8. Both legal representatives agreed that if there was a material error,
       the case should be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal  for  re-
       hearing before a differently constituted Tribunal.

   My Findings on Error of Law and Materiality

    9. Although at paragraph 20 of the  decision,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge stated that he had considered "what evidence there  is  in  the
       matter, whether referred to directly or not", when one actually looks
       at the Judge's findings in respect of whether or  not  the  Appellant
       was in a genuine subsisting relationship with Ms [B], he noted at (c)
       that "there is no supporting evidence  in  the  form  of  letters  or
       statements  from  friends,  colleagues   or   relatives   about   the
       relationship.  The lack of a statement from the Appellant's mother is
       remarkable, given the Appellant says that he lived with  her  for  11
       years until moving in with Ms [B]".  No reference is  there  made  to
       the evidence given by Pastor Lovel Bent, who is a  Senior  Pastor  at
       the New Life Assembly Church in London, who in his letter  dated  the
       19th October 2017, contained at page 23  of  the  Appellant's  bundle
       stated that "I write to confirm that Mr Everton [H], has  been  known
       to me for 3 years,  since  he  started  visiting  New  Life  Assembly
       Church, Dulwich.  He is now an active member  and  regularly  attends
       our services together with Ms [JB] who has been known to us for  over
       20 years.  The NLA Church Elder also wrote as follows:

           'The family of Mr [H] formally requested the hand of our  church
           member, Sister [JB], in  marriage  and  that  according  to  the
           traditions of the NLA Church family, we the NLA  leaders  accept
           and gave our consent'.

       The Pastor stated that subsequent to the approval being given the New
       Life Assembly Church prayed for them both on the  19th  October  2014
       and that they both live together. He wrote "As part  of  my  pastoral
       care responsibilities I have  personally  observed  the  relationship
       between Mr [H] and Ms [B] and can state  unequivocally  that  he  has
       been a great partner, a wonderful, caring man and well-respective  in
       our congregation".

   10. Significantly, the Judge's reference to  there  being  no  supporting
       evidence  in  the  form  of  letters  or  statements  from   friends,
       colleagues or relatives about the relationship, in my judgement  does
       indicate that in fact  the  Learned  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has
       failed to take account of that evidence of Pastor Bent.  There is  no
       evidence anywhere to the Judge actually having seen or considered the
       contents of that document and the clear evidence given by Pastor Bent
       that he personally can  attest  to  the  fact  that  they  are  in  a
       relationship.

   11. Further, as argued by the Appellant, within  the  Appellant's  bundle
       there was also the bail application in respect of the grant  of  bail
       to Mr [H] at page 25 of the bundle, where one of the two sureties for
       the Appellant was said to be [JB] in the  sum  of  �1,000,  with  the
       Appellant being bailed to live at  her  address  at  [~]  Road,  [~].
       There is no reference within the decision to show that  in  fact  the
       Judge had properly considered that evidence, that the  Appellant  had
       actually been bailed by the Tribunal to live  at  Ms  [B]'s  address,
       with her standing as surety for him.

   12. Although it is argued on behalf of the Secretary of  State  that  any
       failure of the  Judge  to  take  account  of  his  evidence  was  not
       material, given the adverse credibility findings made by the Judge in
       respect of the relationship, clearly, when making findings  regarding
       whether or not a relationship is  genuine,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge has to consider the evidence as a whole.  It cannot be said  in
       this case that the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  would
       have been the same irrespective,  had  he  actually  considered  this
       evidence, and there is clearly a possibility  that  the  Judge  might
       have reached a different  conclusion,  had  all  of  the  Appellant's
       evidence been taken into account.   I  therefore  do  find  that  the
       failure of the Judge to take account of this evidence does amount  to
       a material error of law in this case, such that the decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal should be set  aside  in  its  entirety  and  the
       matter be remitted back to the First-tier Tribunal for  consideration
       before any First-tier Tribunal Judge other than  First-tier  Tribunal
       Judge Russell.



Notice of Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Russell does  contain  a  material
error of law and is set aside.  The case is remitted back to the  First-tier
Tribunal for rehearing before  any  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  other  than
First-tier Tribunal Judge Russell.

I do not make an  anonymity  direction  in  this  case,  no  such  anonymity
direction having been sought before me and no  such  Anonymity  Order  being
made by the First-tier Tribunal.
