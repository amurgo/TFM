                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is the Appellant's appeal against the decision  of  Judge  Glossop
    made following a hearing at Hatton Cross on 15th October 2013.



Background

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Uzbekistan born on 22nd  September  1978.
    She came to the  UK  as  a  student  on  28th  November  2008  and  was
    subsequently granted two periods of leave to remain  until  28th  April
    2013.  She made an in time application  for  leave  to  remain  as  the
    spouse of a British citizen which was refused on 20th May 2013 and  the
    subject of the appeal before Judge Glossop.

 3. The Sponsor and Appellant earn jointly �14,500 per year and  they  have
    around �10,000 in savings.  They receive housing benefit.   She  cannot
    meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules  which  state  that  she
    needs to earn �18,600 per annum jointly with her husband.

 4. The judge reviewed the case law, in  particular  MM  [2013]  EWHC  1900
    (Admin).  He then asked himself a series of  rhetorical  questions  and
    stated:

         "The dicta in the above case do not appear to include  a  situation
         where persons agree to marry without giving any adequate thought to
         financial provision or where they have deliberately set their  face
         against achieving the requirements  of  the  new  Rule.   How  much
         featherbedding is to be permitted under Article 8 where parties  do
         not meet the requirements of the new Rule will clearly be a  coming
         matter for debate when  this  particular  case  is  appealed  as  I
         understand to be the case.... I am not inclined to allow Article  8
         to be used to avoid  the  effect  of  the  Immigration  Rule  where
         persons have done little to help themselves to meet it."

 5. The Appellant appealed and permission was granted on 22nd November 2013
    by Judge Grant-Hutchison on the grounds that the judge had erred in law
    in failing to consider the  two  stage  approach  as  advocated  in  MF
    (Nigeria) v  SSHD  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  1192  in  the  application  of  a
    proportionality test as required by the Strasbourg  jurisprudence.   He
    did not consider whether it would be reasonable for  the  Appellant  to
    return to Uzbekistan with or without her British  husband,  who  is  of
    Iraqi origin, or the fact that the Appellant is pregnant and is due  to
    give birth to a British child.

 6. On 15th December 2013 the Respondent served a reply accepting  that  it
    was arguable that the judge erred in law  in  failing  to  specifically
    address Article 8 but, considering  the  facts  of  the  case,  it  was
    questionable whether this could truly be said to be material.

Submissions

 7. Ms Isherwood sought to defend the determination and relied on the  case
    of Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT  640
    and in particular at paragraph 27 which reads as follows:

         "The judge then embarked on a  free-wheeling  Article  8  analysis,
         unencumbered by the rules. That is not the  correct  approach.  The
         Secretary of State had addressed the Article 8  family  aspects  of
         the Respondent's position through the rules,  in  particular  EX.1,
         and the private life aspects through paragraph  276ADE.  The  judge
         should have done likewise, also paying attention to  the  Guidance.
         Thus the judge should have  considered  the  Secretary  of  State's
         conclusion under EX.1 that there were no  insurmountable  obstacles
         preventing the continuation  of  family  life  outside  the  United
         Kingdom. Only if there were  arguably  good  grounds  for  granting
         leave to remain outside the rules was  it  necessary  for  him  for
         Article 8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  were
         compelling circumstances  not  sufficiently  recognised  under  the
         rules (see paragraph 24(b) above)....".

Consideration of whether there was a material Error of Law

 8. The judge clearly  erred.  There  were  good  grounds  for  considering
    whether the Appellant's circumstances were not sufficiently  recognised
    under the Rules, namely the imminent birth of a British  citizen  child
    and  the evidence given at the  appeal  hearing  that  the  Appellant's
    British husband would not be safe in Uzbekistan,  evidence  upon  which
    incidentally no findings were made.  No consideration was given  as  to
    whether EX.1 applied.  The  judge  confined  himself  to  a  series  of
    observations highly critical of the couple's conduct  and  on  the  law
    inappropriate to a determination of an appeal.

 9. In failing to address the issues, he erred in law.

The Resumed Hearing

10. It was  possible  to  continue  to  re-make  the  decision  without  an
    adjournment.  The Appellant gave oral evidence and said that since  the
    last hearing she has given birth to a British child  on  22nd  November
    2013.  She gave evidence that it would be difficult  for  her  husband,
    who originally comes from Iraq, to settle in Uzbekistan  with  her  and
    their child because he does not speak the language and  would  find  it
    difficult to get the proper documentation to  allow  him  to  work.  As
    intermarriage between different nationals was uncommon  in  Uzbekistan,
    they would face hostility there.

11. At the end of the evidence Ms Isherwood submitted  that  there  was  no
    substantial evidence why the family could not go  back  to  Uzbekistan.
    They simply wanted the choice of where to live and the ability to  have
    a better life in the UK which  they  were  not  entitled  to  do.   She
    accepted that the  Appellant  did  not  have  any  adverse  immigration
    history and submitted that it would be better for the British child  to
    return with her mother to Uzbekistan where she would have wider  family
    support.

12. Mr Graham submitted that the appeal ought  to  be  allowed  within  the
    Rules in that it was not reasonable for the child to "take his chances"
    in Uzbekistan.  He would be going to an unpredictable  situation  where
    he could be at risk and would be deprived of the benefit of his British
    citizenship.  There were no countervailing factors as to why  his  best
    interests should not be followed.



Findings and Conclusions

13. EX.1 applies if -

         (a)(i)   the  applicant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  parental
               relationship with a child who -

                (aa)   is under the age of 18 years;

                (bb)   is in the UK;

                (cc)    is  a  British  citizen  or  has  lived  in  the  UK
                    continuously for at least the  seven  years  immediately
                    preceding the date of application; and

         (ii) it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
                UK.

14. Paragraph (a) is satisfied and the only issue is the reasonableness  of
    expecting the British child to go with his mother to Uzbekistan.

15. The Appellant has not been  well-served  by  her  solicitors  who  have
    failed to put in evidence about  whether,  as  is  claimed,  a  British
    citizen of Iraqi origin  would  have  difficulties  both  in  obtaining
    permission to work and hostility from the generalised population.   The
    Appellant's  evidence  is  therefore  uncorroborated,  but   she   gave
    consistent and straightforward evidence and there is no reason to doubt
    that she has many anxieties for the family's safety and well  being  in
    Uzbekistan.  She does have family there however, with whom  she  is  in
    regular contact and, whilst she said they were not  in  a  position  to
    provide accommodation,  there  is  evidence  that  they  have  provided
    financial support in  the  past.   None  of  the  Appellant's  nor  the
    Sponsor's immediate family are in the UK.

16. On the other hand the child is a British citizen.  Whilst he  would  go
    to Uzbekistan with his parents, assuming that  his  father  could  gain
    admittance, there would be clear disadvantages for him. The family  are
    settled in the UK.  Both parents are employed here  and  whilst  it  is
    possible that they could obtain employment in Uzbekistan the  Sponsor's
    lack of language would be a severe impediment.

17. The consideration of the child's best interests is a primary albeit not
    a paramount consideration and  plainly  relevant  to  the  question  of
    reasonableness as set out in EZ.1 (ii).  In ZH (Tanzania) v SSHD [2011]
    UKSC 4 the Supreme Court held that whilst the  best  interests  of  the
    child  can  be  outweighed  by   the   cumulative   effect   of   other
    considerations, they must be considered first. Lord Kerr stated:

      i) "It seems to me self-evident that to diminish a  child's  right  to
         assert his or her nationality will not normally be in  his  or  her
         best interests."

18. In that case the Appellant had an appalling immigration history.

19. Bearing in mind  not only the fact that the child would be deprived  of
    the benefits of British nationality, but also  the  difficulties  which
    this family would have in relocating to Uzbekistan  where  the  Sponsor
    has never been and does not speak  the  language,  his  best  interests
    clearly point  to  the  family  remaining  in  the  UK.  There  are  no
    countervailing factors, and indeed in the longer term it  seems  likely
    that, far from being a drain, this  family  will  be  able  to  make  a
    contribution to the UK economy, given  the  Appellant's  qualifications
    and her husband's skills.

20. In these circumstances it would not be reasonable to expect  the  child
    to leave the UK.  The Appellant falls within EX.1  of  the  Immigration
    Rules and accordingly the appeal is allowed.

Decision

21. The original judge erred in law.  His decision has been set aside.  The
    Appellant's appeal is allowed.
