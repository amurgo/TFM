For the Appellant:     Ms F Shaw
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant's appeal against a decision to  remove  her  to  Pakistan
    was dismissed by a Judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  in  a  decision
    promulgated on 30 January 2015.  That decision was  set  aside  by  the
    Upper Tribunal in a decision made on 28 May 2015, on the basis that  it
    contained an error of law.

2.   The appellant's case was advanced on the  basis  that  her  removal  to
    Pakistan would breach her human rights, in the  light  of  family  ties
    established  here  and  the  absence  of  family  life   in   Pakistan.
    Permission to appeal against the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    was sought on the basis that there was no finding regarding  Regulation
    7(1)(c) of the Immigration (European Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006
    ("the 2006 Regulations"), the evidence which emerged having  in  effect
    required the judge to take into account community law in the assessment
    of the proportionality of the removal decision.

3.   In the remaking of the decision, the appellant relied upon  the  bundle
    of documents prepared in  January  2015  for  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing, including witness statements made by her and by  her  son  and
    his wife, a Dutch national.  Ms Shaw handed up country information  and
    guidance on the position  of  women  in  Pakistan,  in  the  particular
    context of the ability of single women to live alone there.   Mr  Tufan
    handed up a copy of the decision of the Upper Tribunal in  Jaff  [2012]
    UKUT 396 and a short note indicating  that  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal has been allowed in Lim, case number  C5/13/3184,  although  the
    judgment of the Court of Appeal has not yet entered the public  domain.



4.   There is no need to rehearse the detail of the appellant's  case.   She
    arrived here as a visitor in July 2006 and has remained since then.  As
    noted  above,  her  case  was  advanced  on  the  basis  that  she  has
    substantial family and private life ties in the United Kingdom and that
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention is engaged. The  Secretary  of
    State found that the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules  were  not
    met.

5.   In the usual way, the Secretary of State served a notice under  section
    120 of the Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002
    Act") in form IS.76.  This required a response by 30 April 2014.  Seven
    days  before  the  deadline,  the  appellant's  solicitors  provided  a
    Statement of Additional  Grounds  which  appears  at  page  52  of  the
    appellant's bundle.  The second paragraph of the statement is of  great
    importance in this appeal, as will become clear.  It was relied upon by
    Ms Shaw as showing that the appellant was entitled to rely on the  2006
    Regulations, even though she had not applied for leave on  this  basis,
    as paragraph 2 of the Statement of Additional Grounds met  the  minimum
    requirements identified in Jaff.  Mr Tufan argued that paragraph 2  did
    not meet those requirements and was insufficient, the  appellant  being
    left with the availability of  a  further  application  expressly  made
    under the 2006 Regulations, should she wish to assert a right to remain
    on this basis.

The Evidence

6.   Having arrived here in 2006 as a visitor, the  appellant  has  remained
    since then in premises at 225 [-], Slough, owned by  her  daughter  and
    son-in-law. She has four grandchildren who were at a young age when she
    arrived.  These close relatives are  British  citizens.   Also  forming
    part of the household are her son Omer and his Dutch national wife,  Ms
    Hena Syed.  Ms Syed has been present in the United  Kingdom  exercising
    treaty  rights  since  2009.   It  is  not  entirely  clear  when   the
    appellant's son and daughter-in-law moved into  the  premises  but  the
    presence of Ms  Syed  as  an  EEA  national  was  first  drawn  to  the
    respondent's attention, through Capita, in October 2013 in  a  "current
    circumstances pro-forma" sent on that date and it  is  not  in  dispute
    that the couple have remained in the household since they joined it.

7.   The appellant is not required to pay  for  her  accommodation  and  she
    argued before the First-tier  Tribunal  and  in  the  remaking  of  the
    decision that all of her needs are met by her children.

8.   The appellant gave evidence and adopted  the  witness  statement  which
    appeared in her bundle.  She is now 64 years of age and will be  65  in
    October.  In cross-examination, she said that she came  to  the  United
    Kingdom in 2006 to attend her cousin's child's wedding and to  see  her
    children.  She decided to stay and has nobody in Pakistan.  She has two
    sons and a daughter.  Her daughter is here with her four children.  Her
    eldest son lives in Ireland.  Her younger son married in Holland and he
    and his Dutch wife live in Slough now.  This  son,  Omer,  applied  for
    leave to enter in 2006 at the  same  time  as  the  appellant  but  his
    application was refused.  He married his Dutch wife and  then  came  to
    the United Kingdom.  The house the appellant lives in is owned  by  her
    daughter and son-in-law.

9.   The appellant said that she is dependent upon her daughter and  son-in-
    law and also her son and they all live together as a family.  Her  son-
    in-law owns a pizza restaurant, a  takeaway  establishment.   Mr  Tufan
    asked whether her son-in-law was in a position to take care of her  and
    house her.  The appellant replied that they live as a  family  and  are
    very close.

10.  Her son Omer has a security job in a court.   His  earnings  are  about
    �1,500 or �1,600 per month.  Omer gives her  �100  per  month  and  her
    daughter also gives her �100. She spends  the  money  on  the  children
    because she is provided with all her food and clothing by her children.
     Omer's wife works at weekends and in the evenings and she has training
    for a job at present.  The appellant said that she is able to spend the
    money she is given on the children because she has  no  special  needs.
    She is provided with everything.

11.  Omer Aseef  gave  evidence.   He  adopted  his  witness  statement  and
    confirmed that he applied for leave at the same time as his mother,  in
    2006.  He came to the United Kingdom subsequently, having won an appeal
    in 2012, on the basis of his marriage to Ms Syed.  The house they  live
    in is owned by his sister and his brother-in-law, who have  a  mortgage
    together.  They all live together as a family and Omer pays  bills,  as
    does  his  wife.   He  works  as  a  security  officer  at   Maidenhead
    Magistrates' Court.

12.   Bank  statements  and  a  letter  regarding  Omer's  employment   were
    produced, showing receipt of his wages from  his  employer,  a  company
    called Mitie, in June and July 2015 (the sums being �1,349  and  �1,162
    in those respective months).  Omer said that his wife works in a  pizza
    parlour, the restaurant being owned by his brother-in-law.  She is part-
    time there and has also started a new part-time job as  well.   She  is
    being trained at present.  Mr Tufan asked whether she has been  in  the
    United Kingdom throughout.  Omer replied that she has although she went
    to Holland for two days for Eid, to be with her  mother  and  then  her
    mother, father, sister and the children came to the United Kingdom  for
    a visit, before returning to Holland.

13.  Mr Aseef said that he helped his mother make the application for  leave
    to remain.  Mr Tufan asked why the application  was  made  only  on  an
    Article 8 basis and not on the basis of the 2006 Regulations.  Mr Aseef
    replied that at the time, the family was advised that there might be  a
    better  chance  if  the  case  were  based  on  his  sister's   British
    nationality.   He  said  that   his   brother-in-law's   business   was
    successful.  Mr Tufan asked  whether  the  appellant  could  depend  on
    Omer's brother-in-law, rather than on Omer himself and  his  wife.   He
    replied that they managed as a family and  it  would  not  be  fair  if
    everything fell on his sister and brother-in-law.

14.  In re-examination, in answer to  a  question  from  Ms  Shaw  regarding
    whether money might be sent back to  Pakistan  if  his  mother  had  to
    return there, Omer said that the appellant  could  not  return.   There
    were no family members there  and  things  were  dangerous  for  single
    ladies in Pakistan.

15.   Ms  Hena  Syed  then  gave  evidence.  She  too  adopted  her  witness
    statement.  She said that she is a Dutch national, working part-time at
    a pizza restaurant at weekends.  She  has  also  started  another  job,
    working  two  days  a  week,  for  a  distribution  company  and  is  a
    receptionist there.  She will be paid weekly.  Her wages at  the  pizza
    parlour are paid weekly, directly into her bank  account.   She  has  a
    joint account with her husband and her wages appear there,  as  monthly
    credits of �520.

16.  Mr Tufan asked whether and  if  so,  precisely  how  the  appellant  is
    dependent upon Ms Syed.  She replied that she takes care of her mother-
    in-law, taking her to the doctor and looking after her if she  is  ill.
    The appellant asks Ms Syed  to  do  things,  concerning  groceries  and
    things to wear.  She asks for help when making things in  the  kitchen.
    She and her husband  give  the  appellant  �100,  sometimes  weekly  or
    monthly. Her new job would pay her �250 to �300 per month. She was able
    to support her mother-in-law.

17.  Ms Syed said that the house she lives in is owned by her  sister-in-law
    and her brother-in-law.  The pizza parlour is owned by her  brother-in-
    law, her husband's brother.  This makes good money  but  she  does  not
    know precisely how much.  Mr Tufan asked what difference would be  made
    if �100 were not given to the appellant by Ms Syed and her husband.  Ms
    Syed replied that they gave her something for her pocket so that she is
    able to go out.  Everything is provided to her and so she can spend the
    money on the children.

Submissions

18.  Mr Tufan submitted that the appellant could not succeed under  Appendix
    FM or paragraph 276ADE.  The application she made for leave  to  remain
    was based on Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.  In the light of
    recent authorities, compelling circumstances are required to  be  shown
    before a freestanding Article 8 assessment is made.  There were no such
    circumstances here.  Much was made of the appellant's daughter-in-law's
    status as an EEA national but the recourse the  appellant  had  was  to
    make a correct application under the 2006 Regulations.   It  was  clear
    from Jaff that if EEA issues are not raised in  response  to  a  notice
    under section 120 of the 2002 Act, they  cannot  be  considered  in  an
    appeal.  In the present case, there was no express reliance on the 2006
    Regulations, although  paragraph  2  of  the  Statement  of  Additional
    Grounds made mention of a family member of an EEA national.   This  was
    not sufficient.  In any event, there  was  no  evidence  of  dependency
    meeting  the  requirements  of  the  2006  Regulations.   So   far   as
    proportionality was concerned, the appellant had a remedy available and
    could make an application.

19.  Even if the 2006  Regulations  were  required  to  be  considered,  the
    evidence did not show that the appellant  was,  in  reality,  dependent
    upon her son and daughter in law.  The accommodation she  occupied  was
    owned by her son and daughter-in-law and they were  the  real  earners.
    If the �100 claimed to be paid to the appellant by her son and daughter-
    in-law were taken out altogether, nothing would  change  in  substance.
    The appellant's own evidence was  that  the  money  was  spent  on  the
    children.  It appeared that the Upper Tribunal decision in Lim had been
     overturned although the Court of Appeal's judgment  was  not  in  play
    yet.

20.  Ms Shaw said that reliance was placed upon the evidence, including  the
    documents in the appellant's bundle.  Judgment had not yet been  handed
    down in Lim.  The appellant had all her close  family  here,  including
    four grandchildren. She had played a  role  in  their  lives  for  nine
    years.  Her daughter and son-in-law were both British citizens and  her
    son and daughter in law were entitled to remain  here  under  the  2006
    Regulations.  Her son in Ireland also had rights, as an  EEA  national.
    She had no husband.  If she were to return, she would be a single woman
    in imperfect health, soon to be  65  years  old,  the  point  at  which
    statistics suggested that  life  expectancy  reduced  substantially  in
    Pakistan.  The country guidance on single women showed that it was next
    to impossible  for  them  to  live  alone.  All  of  this  amounted  to
    compelling reasons, requiring  an  Article  8  assessment  outside  the
    rules. If the appellant were to return, with the benefit of funds  sent
    to her thereafter, this would make her  even  more  vulnerable  as  she
    would become a target.

21.  Even though she could not meet the requirements  of  Appendix  FM,  she
    could still put her case on the basis of paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi).   If
    she returned to Pakistan, she might then be able to meet the  dependent
    relative requirements of the rules  but  the  principle  identified  in
    Chikwamba fell to be applied.

22.  So far as dependency was concerned, the appellant  was  clearly  funded
    by the whole family.  The Secretary of State's IDIs made it clear  that
    it does not matter if a claimant has income  from  another  source,  so
    long as there is dependence on an EEA national  for  essentials.    The
    evidence was clear in this regard, the appellant relying upon  her  son
    and daughter-in-law for help with essential items.  Ms Syed was an  EEA
    national exercising treaty rights and the appellant fell  within  scope
    as the family member of her spouse, under  Regulation  7(1)(c)  of  the
    2006 Regulations.  It was clear that dependency had been raised  before
    the First-tier Tribunal, as  paragraphs  10  and  17  of  the  decision
    showed, where the evidence adduced by and on behalf  of  the  appellant
    was set out.

23.  The appellant  relied  on  Jaff.   Paragraph  2  of  the  Statement  of
    Additional Grounds showed that the case under the 2006 Regulations  was
    set out in substance. The appellant was entitled  to  succeed  on  this
    basis as the removal decision would breach community law.  Even if  the
    Statement  of  Additional  Grounds  fell  short  of  the   requirements
    identified  in  Jaff,  community  law  was  still  a  factor   in   the
    proportionality assessment.  It would be  disproportionate  to  require
    the appellant to leave in order to apply on a community law  basis,  to
    return.  So far as section 117B of the 2002 Act  was  concerned,  there
    was no public interest of any real substance in the appellant's removal
    to Pakistan.

Findings and Conclusions

24.  In this appeal, the burden lies with the appellant to prove  the  facts
    and matters she relies upon and the standard of  proof  is  that  of  a
    balance of probabilities.

25.  The first important issue  to  resolve  is  whether  the  appellant  is
    entitled to rely on the 2006 Regulations, in her claim to  fall  within
    Regulation 7(1)(c) as a person to be treated as the  family  member  of
    another person, within the category of "dependent direct  relatives  in
    his ascending line or that of his spouse ..."  It  is  not  in  dispute
    that the appellant's daughter-in-law,  Ms  Syed,  is  an  EEA  national
    present here exercising treaty rights.  The critical question,  if  she
    can  rely  on  the  2006  Regulations,  is  whether  the  appellant  is
    "dependent".

26.  The 2006 Regulations did not feature in the application  for  leave  to
    remain made by the appellant, which gave rise to the removal  decision.
    However, the Secretary of State served a notice under  section  120  of
    the 2002 Act  and  in  response  to  that,  the  appellant  provided  a
    Statement of Additional Grounds through her  solicitors.   Paragraph  2
    is, in summary, as follows:-

         "The applicant's entire family is residing in the UK.   The  family
         includes a daughter and  her  family  as  stated  in  the  original
         application, son namely Mr Omer Aseef ... who has leave  to  remain
         in the UK as the family member of an EEA national who is exercising
         treaty rights in the UK.  ...  Furthermore  the  applicant's  other
         son, namely Mr Ali Aseef Khan ... is also residing in the  UK  with
         his wife who is a British citizen. ... The applicant's children are
         providing  necessary  financial  assistance  and  care,   including
         residence, to her."

27.  In order to rely upon the 2006 Regulations,  the  appellant  must  show
    that her statement sets out with some particularity the  ground  relied
    upon by her as a foundation for remaining in  the  United  Kingdom  and
    upon which reliance has not previously  been  placed.   The  additional
    ground must be "stated" in  substance.   Merely  setting  out  evidence
    regarding a claimed relationship with someone, without any reference to
    her EEA status and a claimed right to reside will  fall  short,  as  is
    clear from paragraph 24 of the decision in Jaff.

28.  Paragraph 2 of the Statement of Additional Grounds expressly refers  to
    the appellant's son as the family member of an EEA national  exercising
    treaty rights here.  The appellant's other son, a British  citizen,  is
    also mentioned.  Critical, in my judgement, is the  final  sentence  of
    paragraph 2, where the appellant's "children", which  must  include  Mr
    Omer,  are  described  as  providing  financial  assistance,  care  and
    accommodation.  I think this is just sufficient to set out  a  case  in
    which dependency as a relative in the ascending line  is  stated.   The
    essential components of Regulation 7(1)(c) of the 2006 Regulations  are
    set out.

29.  Mr Tufan was perfectly entitled to raise as an  issue  the  absence  of
    reliance upon the 2006 Regulations when the application for  leave  was
    made and he is absolutely right to say that an application may still be
    made. Nonetheless, I conclude that the 2006 Regulations may  be  relied
    upon in this appeal.

30.  The evidence  shows  that  a  consistent  case  has  been  put  by  the
    appellant regarding dependency.  She has no income of her  own  and  no
    substantial resources. She has been provided with  accommodation  which
    is owned by her son and daughter-in-law.  The evidence of  the  support
    given by the appellant's son Omer and his Dutch wife was  substantially
    the same as given in the First-tier Tribunal.  Although they arrived in
    the household only in about 2013, Omer and his wife both earn and  make
    financial contributions to the overall costs of running the  household.
    Ms Syed said, and I accept, that she helps her mother-in-law by  caring
    for her, taking her to the doctor  when  necessary,  helping  her  with
    groceries  and  day-to-day  tasks,  including  preparing  food  in  the
    kitchen.  As she works part-time, she is in a position to provide  this
    assistance.  She and her husband contribute �100,  usually  per  month,
    given to the appellant directly, a  similar  sum  being  given  by  the
    appellant's son and daughter-in-law.

31.  The evidence shows, I find, that the household  is  jointly  run,  with
    all the earners making a contribution.  Although it may  very  well  be
    the case that the appellant's daughter and son-in-law  earn  more  than
    Omer and his wife, the evidence does not show that they provide all the
    care that the appellant requires, or that the financial  and  practical
    assistance given by Omer and Ms  Syed  is  negligible  or  of  no  real
    substance.  The practical assistance Ms Syed provides is sufficient, as
    Ms  Shaw  submitted,  to  be  described  as   support   regarding   the
    "essentials" of the appellant's life, including her health,  sustenance
    and general day-to-day welfare.

32.  The judgment of the Court of Appeal in Lim appears not to be  available
    yet.  There is no need to show that the appellant is "wholly" dependent
    upon her son and daughter-in-law.  Moreover, as the evidence shows that
    the appellant has no independent means at all, her  dependency  is  not
    appropriately described as one of choice.  Overall, the evidence  shows
    that the appellant can bring herself within Regulation 7(1)(c)  of  the
    2006 Regulations and so the decision to remove her is unlawful  in  the
    light of community law.

33.  There is no need to consider Article 8 of the Human  Rights  Convention
    separately in any detail but in  the  light  of  my  finding  that  the
    appellant can rely upon community law, the weight to be  given  to  the
    state's  case  that  she  should  be  removed  to  Pakistan   is   very
    substantially  reduced.   On  the  altogether  artificial  basis   that
    community law is put  to  one  side,  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules in relation to Article 8 and  the
    evidence falls far  short  of  showing  that  her  children  and  close
    relatives would be unable to support her in  Pakistan,  to  the  extent
    that there would be no need for her to live  alone.   However,  as  the
    appellant has shown that she is a  dependent  direct  relative  in  the
    ascending line of her daughter-in-law, the appeal is allowed.
