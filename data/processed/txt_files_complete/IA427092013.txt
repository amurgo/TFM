Representation:

For the claimant: Mr J Howard, instructed by McGrath Immigration Solicitors
For the appellant:     Mr N Smart, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The claimant, Theodore Ufah, date of birth 26.8.72,  is  a  citizen  of
    Nigeria.

 2. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against the  determination
    of First-tier Tribunal Judge Sangha  promulgated  2.7.14,  allowing  on
    human rights grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the
    respondent, dated 1.10.13, to  refuse  his  application  for  leave  to
    remain in the UK outside the Immigration Rules on the basis of  private
    and/or family life as  the  spouse  of  Sandra  Wellington,  a  British
    citizen, and to remove him from the UK  pursuant  to  directions  under
    section 47 of the Immigation Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. The Judge
    heard the appeal on 28.5.14.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lambert  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    4.9.14.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 19.12.14 as an appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the determination of Judge Sangha should be set aside.

 6. It is clear that the claimant could not  satisfy  the  requirements  of
    Appendix FM in respect of family life or paragraph 276ADE in respect of
    private life. The grounds  of  application  for  permission  to  appeal
    submit that the judge failed to identify compelling  circumstances  not
    sufficiently   recognised   in   the   Immigration   Rules   justifying
    consideration of the case outside the Rules on the basis of  article  8
    ECHR.

 7. The second ground of appeal is that in the  article  8  proportionality
    exercise, following the Razgar  five  steps,  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge failed to have regard to the public interest in maintaining  firm
    immigration control.

 8. In granting permission  to  appeal,  Judge  Lambert  noted  that,  "The
    content of the second sentence of paragraph  18  of  the  determination
    amply supports this  contention.  There  is  the  barest  reference  to
    Gulshan (Article 8 - new rules - correct approach)  [2013]  UKUT  00640
    and no engagement at all with the question whether or why on the  facts
    of the case the Article 8 exercise was justified. There is therefore an
    arguable error of law disclosed by the application."

 9. I have considered and taken into account the claimant's Rule 24  reply,
    under cover of letter dated 18.12.14.

10. I agree with the claimant that there no merit in the  first  ground  of
    appeal. It follows from section 86 of the 2002 Act that if raised,  the
    Tribunal was obliged to address the article 8 ECHR private  and  family
    life claim. On the facts of this case, it is inevitable that an article
    8 assessment would have to be made, especially since Ganesabalan v SSHD
    [2014] EWHC 2712 Admin)  has  made  it  clear  that  there  can  be  no
    threshold requirement to consideration of article 8  ECHR,  unless  the
    Rules are a complete code, which they  are  not  for  consideration  of
    private  and  family  life  claims  cases  other  than  in  respect  of
    deportation decisions.

11. Although case law continues to develop, the current position is perhaps
    best expressed in paragraph 135 of  R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014]  EWCA
    Civ 985:
         135.  Where the relevant group of  IRs  [immigration  rules],  upon
         their proper construction provide a  "complete  code"  for  dealing
         with a person's Convention rights in the context of a particular IR
         or statutory provision, such as in the case of "foreign criminals",
         then the balancing exercise and the way the various factors are  to
         be taken into account  in  an  individual  case  must  be  done  in
         accordance with  that  code,  although  reference  to  "exceptional
         circumstances"   in   the   code   will   nonetheless   entail    a
         proportionality exercise.  But if the relevant group of IRs is  not
         such a "complete code" then the proportionality test will  be  more
         at large, albeit guided by the Huang tests and  UK  and  Strasbourg
         case law."


12. In respect of the second ground of appeal, it is correct that at �18 of
    the decision, the First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  made  reference  to  the
    public interest and  the  legitimate  aim  of  maintaining  immigration
    control, deciding that the refusal decision was in accordance with  the
    law. It was also noted that the task before the judge was, "to  achieve
    a just balance between the appellant's interest interest  in  maintaing
    his family/private life in the UK including the sponsor and the  public
    interest of securing immigration control." However, that was  the  full
    extent of the consideration of the public  interest  and  it  does  not
    feature at  all  in  the  factors  considered  in  the  proportionality
    balancing exercise. For example, the fact that the claimant cannot meet
    the requirements of the Rules for leave to remain  is  not  taken  into
    account. There is no adequate assessment as  to  whether  it  would  be
    reasonable to expect the appellant and the British spouse  to  continue
    family life in Nigeria, or, even though other aspects  of  Appendix  FM
    could not be met, whether the test in EX1 could be met, that there  are
    insurmountable obstacles to continuing family life outside the UK. That
    she cannot be required to leave the UK does not mean that  family  life
    could not be continued outside the UK. At the  time  of  marriage,  the
    claimant and the sponsor must have understood that his status in the UK
    was precarious and that he had no right to remain. He came to the UK as
    a student and he must be expected to have intended to leave the  UK  on
    completion of his studies or by the expiry of his leave in  July  2012.
    Cases such as Nasim and Patel have made  it  clear  that  the  sort  of
    private life  a  student  acquires  in  the  UK  does  not  engage  the
    protection of  article  8,  which  looks  to  the  physical  and  moral
    integrity of the individual. Further, it is  not  a  factor  mitigating
    against removal that the claimant has been law-abiding and paid  taxes,
    as relied on by the judge at �19. The judge found  that  there  was  no
    evidence to show that medical facilities would be available to  her  in
    Nigeria, but neither had the claimant shown that the medical facilities
    would not be available.

13.  In the circumstances,  I  find  that  the  article  8  proportionality
    assessment was one-sided, failed to take proper account of  the  public
    interest in removal of the claimant, and thus unfair to  the  Secretary
    of State. The decision cannot stand and must be set aside and remade.

14. When a decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside,  section
    12(2) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 requires either
    that the case is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  with  directions,
    or it must be remade by the Upper Tribunal. The scheme of the Tribunals
    Court and Enforcement Act 2007 does not assign the function of  primary
    fact finding to the Upper Tribunal. Where the findings are  unclear  on
    crucial issues at the heart of an appeal, as they  are  in  this  case,
    effectively there has not been a valid determination of  those  issues.
    The errors of the First-tier Tribunal vitiates all  other  findings  of
    fact and the conclusions from those facts so that there has not been  a
    valid determination of the issues in the appeal.

15. In all the circumstances, at the invitation and request of both parties
    to relist this appeal for a fresh hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, I
    do so on the basis that this is a case which falls squarely within  the
    Senior President's Practice Statement at paragraph 7.2. The  effect  of
    the error has been to deprive the Secretary of State of a fair  hearing
    and that the nature or extent of any judicial  fact  finding  which  is
    necessary for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is  such  that,
    having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2 to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly, including with the avoidance of delay, I  find  that
    it is appropriate to remit this appeal to the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
    determine the appeal afresh.

Conclusion & Decision:

16. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

     I set aside the decision.

                    I remit the making of the decision in the appeal to  the
                    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

Consequential Directions

17. The appeal is to be remitted to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  sitting  at
    Birmingham;

18. The hearing is to be de novo, with no findings preserved;

19. The estimated length of hearing is 1.5 hours;

20. No interpreter is required.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The outcome of the appeal remains to be decided.
