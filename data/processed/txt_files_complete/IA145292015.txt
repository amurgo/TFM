Representation:

For the Appellant:     No appearance by or on behalf of the Appellant
For the Respondent:    Mr D Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is  a  citizen  of  India  born  in  1984.   He  made  an
    application on 19 November 2014 for leave to remain as a spouse.   That
    application was refused in a decision dated 26  May  2015  alongside  a
    decision  to  make  removal  directions  under  Section   47   of   the
    Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

 2. The appellant appealed against the decisions and the appeal came before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Blundell ("the  FtJ")  at  a  hearing  on  23
    September 2016.  At that hearing there  was  no  appearance  by  or  on
    behalf of the appellant and indeed  no  appearance  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent.  Similarly, there is no appearance by or on behalf  of  the
    appellant before me today.

 3. In relation to the non-attendance of the appellant today, there was  an
    application for an adjournment on the basis  that  his  fiancï¿½e  is  in
    Mauritius and would be returning to the UK on  16  August  2017.   That
    application was refused by a judge of the  Upper  Tribunal  on  10  May
    2017, the refusal having been communicated to the appellant  by  letter
    of the same date.  There is no indication from the appellant as to  why
    he personally is not able to attend the hearing today. No messages have
    been received indicating that he is unable to attend  for  some  reason
    and would otherwise have wanted to.

 4. The Upper Tribunal Judge who refused  the  adjournment  stated  as  her
    reason that the matter being listed for an error of  law  hearing,  the
    evidence of the witness is not material.  She  said  that  if  it  were
    necessary to re-make the decision and hear  evidence,  the  application
    for an adjournment could be renewed at the hearing.

 5. I am satisfied that it is appropriate to proceed in the absence of  the
    appellant  pursuant  to  rule  38  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 and the overriding objective set out  in  rule  2.
    It is plain that the appellant is aware of the hearing today and, as  I
    have indicated, there is nothing from him to suggest that he was unable
    to attend or that he has any good reason for not attending.

 6. The grounds of appeal in relation to the hearing before the FtJ whereby
    he dismissed the appeal on human rights grounds, are summarised in  the
    grant  of  permission.  The  permission  judge  said  as  follows,   to
    summarise, namely that it was arguable that the FtJ acted unfairly  and
    deprived the appellant of a fair hearing given that the  appellant  had
    made an application on 16 September 2016 to vacate the  hearing  before
    the FtJ on the ground that his partner was medically  unfit  to  attend
    the hearing at that time.  The grant of  permission  states  that  that
    application was supported by medical evidence and that the (First-tier)
    Tribunal had initially refused the application  because  there  was  no
    indication of when the witness would be able to attend, that refusal of
    the adjournment having been on 19 September  2016.   It  was  therefore
    arguable,  so  it  is  said,  that  that  gave  rise  to  a  legitimate
    expectation that the application would be granted  if  this  issue  was
    addressed.

 7. The grant of permission also states that the  appellant  addressed  the
    issue in the refusal of the adjournment by indicating that his  partner
    would be well enough to attend the hearing if it was  listed  after  17
    November 2016. Thus, it is said to be arguable that the FtJ  was  wrong
    to refuse the application for  a  different  reason,  namely  that  the
    witness could make a witness statement and that there was no reason why
    she needed to attend in person. That reason  is  said  to  be  arguably
    flawed given that the Tribunal was bound to attach  less  weight  to  a
    written statement than to oral testimony tested by cross-examination.

 8. Furthermore, the appellant had subsequently claimed that his  partner's
    medical condition was such that he would need to care for  her  on  the
    date of the hearing.    It  was  said  to  be  arguable  that  the  FtJ
    considered the reason given by the appellant for  his  absence  at  the
    hearing only after he  had  already  decided  to  hear  the  appeal  in
    absence. This arguably gave rise to an appearance that this was  simply
    providing ex post facto reasons for the decision that had already  been
    taken.  It was arguable that by that stage the FtJ was functus officio.



 9. The FtJ noted that despite a request from the Tribunal's administration
    that  the  respondent  should  file  and  serve  a  bundle,  none   was
    forthcoming.  However,  he  concluded   that   there   was   sufficient
    information from which to determine the appeal in any event.

10. He  referred  to  the  application  for  leave  to  remain  citing  the
    appellant's length of residence in the UK, his  relationship  with  his
    pet goldfish and his need for ongoing medical treatment  in  connection
    with a foot injury.

11. In the appellant's notice of appeal, which the FtJ also summarised,  it
    was said that the sole ground pursued was that the appellant's  removal
    would be unlawful under Article 8 of the ECHR, the appellant relying on
    his relationship with a Mauritian national (Ms A) whom he  had  met  in
    2011 when they both had leave to remain as Tier 4  Migrants,  and  that
    they were engaged to be married.   She apparently had leave  to  remain
    until 31 May 2016 and the grounds stated that the  appellant  had  made
    his application for leave to remain at a time when Ms A had returned to
    Mauritius in order to make a further entry clearance application  as  a
    result of which he had been unable to rely on their relationship in his
    application for further leave.

12. It is also recorded by the FtJ that the grounds state that Ms A had re-
    entered the UK with entry clearance in January 2015 and  was  studying.
    Under a heading 'Procedural History' the FtJ said that the  appeal  was
    initially listed to be heard in Newport on  8  June  2016  but  at  the
    appellant's request, he living in Southall at the time, the hearing was
    adjourned to a hearing centre nearer to where he lived.

13. The FtJ noted that on 16 September 2016 the appellant  had  written  to
    the Tribunal asking for the hearing to be adjourned.   Ms  A  had  been
    involved in an armed robbery whilst she was  working  at  Ladbrokes  on
    Finchley Road.  Evidence in support of that contention was provided and
    summarised by the FtJ, the robbery having taken place  on  5  September
    2016.  There was medical evidence to the effect that she was  suffering
    from post traumatic stress disorder and  the  letter  referred  to  her
    condition being reviewed in two months' time after  which  he  expected
    her to be fit to attend court.  There was a signed statement from Ms  A
    confirming what the appellant had said and medical evidence from the GP
    saying that she would be unable to attend the hearing on 23  September.
    There was also evidence from the police which supported the  contention
    that there had been that crime on 5 September 2016.

14. The FtJ noted that a designated judge had refused the adjournment on 19
    September 2016, stating that  there  was  no  indication  of  when  the
    witness would be able to attend and that the case should proceed on the
    basis of any witness statement provided by her.  The application for an
    adjournment was  renewed  by  letter  dated  20  September  2016.   The
    appellant had said that Ms A would be able to attend the hearing  after
    17 November 2016 but that it had not been possible to prepare  for  the
    hearing because she had not been able  to  give  a  witness  statement.
    Again, that application was refused by Designated Judge of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal, the reasons being that there was no good  reason  as  to
    why the witness could not make a  witness  statement  relevant  to  the
    facts in issue and that she did not need to attend in person.

15. The hearing before the  FtJ  was  listed  as  a  floating  case  on  23
    September as recorded by the FtJ.  There was no  appearance  by  or  on
    behalf of the appellant and  the  judge  stated  that  he  resolved  to
    consider the appeal in his absence.  He then  stated  at  [10]  of  his
    decision that unbeknownst to him at the time, the appellant had sent  a
    third application for an adjournment and the letter in support  of  the
    application for an adjournment was sent to him after he  had  left  the
    hearing.  In the letter the appellant  had  said  that  the  Tribunal's
    consideration of his adjournment applications  had  been  "insensitive,
    unjust and unfair", in that the medical evidence  had  not  been  taken
    into account.  It also said that his witness, Ms A, was not  in  a  fit
    mental  state  to  complete  any  witness  statement  because  she  was
    suffering from severe PTSD.  The appellant also said that he  would  be
    unable to attend the hearing as Ms A was his prime focus  and  that  it
    was not safe to leave her alone.  The FtJ recorded that the adjournment
    application was renewed for those same reasons.

16. At [11] the FtJ said that  he  considered  afresh  whether  the  matter
    should be adjourned or whether it was in the interests of  justice  for
    the appeal to proceed in his absence.  He referred specifically to  the
    GP's letter and quoted part of it.   He  noted  at  [12]  that  it  was
    apparent that the letter did not state that she was unable to  complete
    a witness statement.  He said that that would have  been  a  surprising
    suggestion because in fact she made a statement in support of the first
    adjournment application.  He noted that that statement was  signed  and
    dated by her.  He said that like the designated judge who  refused  the
    second application for an adjournment, he did not  understand  why  she
    was unable to make a witness statement for the purposes of the  appeal,
    nor did he understand why  the  appellant  was  unable  to  attend  the
    hearing.

17. He noted that the appellant lived in Hounslow which is a short distance
    from the hearing centre and that there was no suggestion in the medical
    evidence that Ms A,  who  he  said  had  doubtlessly  suffered  a  very
    upsetting experience, required round the clock care from the appellant.



18. In further considering the application for an adjournment  he  referred
    to the decision in Nwaigwe (adjournment: fairness)  [2014]  UKUT  00418
    (IAC) and he referred to the overriding objective.  He  said  that  the
    overarching consideration was whether the appellant would  be  deprived
    of his right to a fair hearing.  He then said that he had  declined  to
    adjourn the hearing.  He  noted  that  the  respondent's  decision  was
    issued 18 months before the hearing and that Counsel  had  settled  the
    grounds of appeal to the Tribunal in April 2015 informing the  Tribunal
    that reliance was to be placed on the appellant's relationship with  Ms
    A.

19. Crucially in my judgement, he said that since then  the  appellant  had
    filed and served nothing whatsoever apart from the adjournment requests
    to which he had referred.  There was no statement from Ms A in  support
    of the appeal and there was only the statement she prepared in  support
    of the adjournment application.  There was no indication, much less any
    proof, that Ms A had renewed her leave to remain in the United Kingdom.



20. He also recalled that in the grounds of appeal settled by counsel,  she
    had leave until May 2016 but there was no evidence to show  as  to  how
    the appellant contended that the requirements of the Immigration  Rules
    could be met or how his removal would be a breach of Article 8  of  the
    ECHR.

21. He said at [14] that he had  every  sympathy  for  Ms  A  and  accepted
    without question the medical evidence which states that she was  unable
    to attend the hearing, but the fact that a witness is unable to  attend
    does not mean, without more,  that  the  Tribunal  should  adjourn  the
    hearing.

22. He stated that having considered all the circumstances, but  not  least
    the absence of an adequate reason for the  appellant's  non-attendance,
    and the absence of any preparation being undertaken in  the  18  months
    before the listing of the appeal,  he  concluded  that  the  overriding
    objective favoured proceeding with the appeal in  the  absence  of  the
    appellant.

23. He then considered Article 8 of the ECHR.  He noted that the  appellant
    did not contend that he met the requirements of the  Immigration  Rules
    in any respect, in particular in relation to paragraph  276ADE(1).   He
    also said that  the  appellant  did  not  seemingly  contend  that  his
    relationship with  Ms  A  was  such  as  to  satisfy  the  Rules  which
    accommodate the partners of relevant points-based system migrants.   He
    had  only  contended  that  removal   would   be   a   disproportionate
    interference with their right to family life together.

24. In the following paragraph he said that he was prepared to  assume  for
    the purposes of his decision that the appellant and Ms A are engaged to
    be married and that their relationship is a genuine and subsisting one.
     However, even assuming that to be the case, he said that the Article 8
    case was bound to fail at the first hurdle because of  the  appellant's
    failure to file any evidence in support of the appeal during the months
    that it had been pending.

25. He stated that there was no  evidence  to  show  what  Ms  A's  present
    immigration status was. No reason was given as  to  why  the  appellant
    could not enjoy his family life with her in either Mauritius or  India,
    and he concluded that it was very clear from the  authorities  that  it
    would be a rare case that succeeded under Article 8 where there are  no
    insurmountable obstacles to the continuation  of  family  life  abroad,
    citing the decision in Agyarko  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2015] EWCA Civ 440.  This was not  an  example  of  a  case
    where there were such  insurmountable  obstacles.   He  concluded  that
    there was no indication within the grounds, or in any other  aspect  in
    the material that was  before  him,  that  there  might  be  compelling
    circumstances such that absent  insurmountable  obstacles  this  appeal
    should be allowed.

26. He then referred to s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum
    Act 2002 and the factors that need to be taken  into  account  in  that
    respect under Article 8.  He resolved certain matters in favour of  the
    appellant, for example that the appellant was not in the UK  unlawfully
    when his family life with Ms A started but he did nevertheless refer to
    the 'precariousness' issue which was a relevant  factor  to  take  into
    account.

27. He found that there was nothing to show  that  the  appellant  and  his
    fiancï¿½ are financially independent which was a factor against them,  or
    that they were able to speak English to  the  requisite  standard.   He
    concluded that there was simply no proper basis upon which the Tribunal
    could conceivably accept  that  the  appellant's  removal  would  be  a
    disproportionate interference with any family life  which  might  exist
    between him and Ms A.  He further concluded that  the  appellant  would
    obviously prefer to stay in the UK with his partner until she completed
    her studies but Article 8 did not provide an entitlement to choose  the
    country in which family life continues,  and  does  not  in  this  case
    render his removal unlawful under Section 6 of  the  Human  Rights  Act
    1998.

28. In submissions on behalf of the respondent before me, Mr Clarke  relied
    on the 'rule 24' response.  Up-to-date information was provided in  the
    form of a printout from the respondent's records indicating that  Ms  A
    had voluntarily returned to Mauritius on 4 March 2017.  It is  apparent
    that that information does relate to her because the date of  birth  is
    the same on the record as on the documents provided in  the  Tribunal's
    file, in particular her passport.  The middle name is  also  the  same.
    It was not clear therefore, how she could in any event be able to  come
    back to the UK, in  particular  in  terms  of  her  appearance  at  any
    hearing.  It was submitted, to summarise, that the FtJ  had  considered
    every aspect of the adjournment application, had properly  applied  the
    overriding objective but was entitled to take into account the lack  of
    evidence provided by the appellant in support of the appeal.

29. I am satisfied that the FtJ's consideration of the application  for  an
    adjournment is free from any error of law.  The FtJ plainly had in mind
    the overriding objective.  He took into account all the  circumstances.
    It is not the case, as the grounds of appeal suggest or imply, that the
    FtJ overlooked the seriousness of Ms A's  condition  and  the  evidence
    suggesting that she is suffering from PTSD.  The FtJ  expressly  stated
    that he accepted that medical evidence, for example at  [14].   He  was
    perfectly entitled, and indeed bound, to take into account  that  Ms  A
    had in fact prepared a witness statement which she had signed and dated
    relatively recently before the hearing in support  of  the  application
    for an adjournment.  He was entitled to find therefore, that there  was
    no basis from which to conclude that she could not make a statement  in
    support of the appeal.

30. He also took into account, quite properly,  the  fact  that  there  was
    absolutely no evidence from the appellant in support of the  contention
    that his removal would amount to a disproportionate  interference  with
    their family life.  As I have indicated,  at  [13]  he  said  that  the
    appellant had filed  and  served  nothing  whatsoever  apart  from  the
    adjournment requests, and indeed that is still the position as  at  the
    date of the hearing before me today.

31. The FtJ referred to the absence of any preparation being undertaken  in
    the 18 months  before  the  substantive  listing  of  the  appeal.   No
    question of legitimate expectation  arose  in  terms  of  the  previous
    refusal of the application for an adjournment stating that there was no
    indication as to when Ms A would be well enough to  attend  a  hearing.
    Each application for an adjournment has to be  considered  on  its  own
    merits and there was nothing to suggest that it was  held  out  to  the
    appellant that if that matter was  addressed,  an  adjournment  of  the
    hearing would be granted.

32. The FtJ considered every aspect of the appeal in terms of the  evidence
    that was before him and came to conclusions that were  fully  justified
    on the evidence.  There simply was no basis upon which the appeal could
    be allowed, and the adjournment issue was dealt with entirely  properly
    by the FtJ.

33. In all those circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any  error
    of law in the decision of the FtJ.   The  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to dismiss the appeal therefore stands.

    Decision


    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a  point  of  law.  Its  decision  to  dismiss  the  appeal
    therefore stands.
