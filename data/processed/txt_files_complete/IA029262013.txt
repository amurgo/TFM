For the Appellant:
For the Respondent:     Mr Lam, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



 1. This is an appeal against the determination of the First-tier  Tribunal
    heard before Judge Scott, promulgated on 6 November 2013,  whereby  the
    appellant's application for a residence  card  as  an  extended  family
    member of an EEA national exercising treaty rights in this country  was
    dismissed.

 2. The appellant, Mr Karim Hamaoui, was born in  Algeria  on  4  September
    1972.  The sponsor is his brother Mourad who  is  a  Swedish  national.
    The appellant came to the United Kingdom on 24 February 2002 on  a  six
    month visa and has been here ever since, effectively  for  over  eleven
    years as an overstayer.  On 22 August 2012 he applied for  a  residence
    card but this was refused by the Secretary of State on 3  January  2013
    under Regulation 8(2)  of  the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)
    Regulations 2006.  This provides insofar as is material:

         "8.-

         (2)  A person satisfies the condition  in  this  paragraph  if  the
             person is a relative of an EEA national,  his  spouse  or  his
             civil partner and

             (a)  the person is residing in a country other than the United
                  Kingdom in which the EEA  national  also  resides  and  is
                  dependent upon the EEA national or  is  a  member  of  his
                  household;

             (b)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a)  and
                  is accompanying the EEA national to the United Kingdom  or
                  wishes to join him there; or

             (c)  the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a)  has
                  joined  the  EEA  national  in  the  United  Kingdom   and
                  continues to be dependent upon him or to be  a  member  of
                  his household."

 3. In the case of Dauhoo (EEA Regulations - Regulation 8(2))  [2012]  UKUT
    79 (IAC) this Tribunal held that a person can succeed  in  establishing
    that he is an extended family member in any one of four different  ways
    each of which  requires  proving  a  relevant  connection  both  before
    arriving in the United Kingdom and in the United Kingdom, namely -

    (1)  prior dependency and present dependency;

    (2)  prior membership of  a  household  and  present  membership  of  a
         household;

    (3)  prior dependency and present membership of a household;

    (4)  prior membership of a household and present dependency.

 4. Now, having heard evidence from the appellant, the  sponsor  and  three
    other witnesses, the First-tier Tribunal concluded that since coming to
    the United Kingdom in February 2002 the appellant has lived as a member
    of the sponsor's household and has been financially dependent  on  him.
    The issue therefore was whether the appellant satisfied  the  first  or
    "prior" part of the test in respect either of prior dependency or prior
    membership of a household.  At paragraph 26 of his determination  Judge
    Scott held that the prior  membership  of  a  household  test  was  not
    satisfied.  This was  because  the  appellant  lived  in  his  father's
    household and not the sponsor's.  Not merely did  the  father  own  the
    house, he paid the bills since the sponsor left Algeria in 1986.

 5. This left the question of prior dependency.  The First-tier  Tribunal's
    enquiry focused on the period 2000 to February 2002.   There  was  some
    evidence, albeit of an unsatisfactory  nature,  that  the  sponsor  was
    contributing financially towards the cost of the  appellant's  studies.
    The appellant completed his studies in 2000.  As for  the  key  period,
    one of less  than  two  years,  the  First-tier  Tribunal  reached  the
    following conclusion:

         "29. The question then is whether the appellant  was  dependent  on
             the sponsor after he finished his degree in 2000 and before he
             came to the  United  Kingdom  in  February  2002.   There  was
             evidence that money was sent to the appellant by the  sponsor,
             but I found that evidence to be inconsistent as to the amounts
             and non-specific as to the frequency of remittances.   It  was
             also said that money was sent by the sponsor by way  of  money
             transfers but there is simply no  evidence  to  support  this.
             The appellant estimated that he received an average  of  about
             ï¿½130 per month from the sponsor, but I find that the  evidence
             does not support that claim.

         30.  Bearing in mind that, throughout the period in  question,  the
             appellant  lived  at  home  in  his  father's  house  and  was
             supported by him there, I am unable to find that the appellant
             was dependent on the sponsor.  I accept that  he  did  receive
             some money from the sponsor from time to time, but  I  am  not
             satisfied that the funds sent were any  more  than  occasional
             gifts sent out of  the  love,  favour  and  affection  of  the
             sponsor for his younger brother, the appellant."

 6.  Accordingly,  the  case  under  Regulation  8(2)  of  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 was dismissed.  It is not the
    appellant's case that the First-tier Tribunal lapsed into factual error
    or reached a decision which was perverse and/or based on  no  evidence.
    Rather the complaint is that no regard was paid to relevant Home Office
    Guidance.  Paragraph 2.4 of the Guidance  on  EEA  family  members,  in
    particular extended family members, provides insofar as material;

         "An applicant may be considered under  Regulation  8  of  the  2006
         Regulations if she/he falls within any of the following conditions:

         .    was living as part of the EEA national's household in  an  EEA
             state before the EEA national came to the United Kingdom; or

         .    is living as part of  the  EEA  national's  household  in  the
             United Kingdom; or

         .    has joined the EEA national in the  UK  and  continues  to  be
             dependent on the EEA  national  or  his  or  her  spouse  (see
             Section 2.3.2); or

         .    strictly requires personal  care  from  the  EEA  national  on
             serious health grounds;

         .    and prove that she/he is in a durable  relationship  with  the
             EEA national."

 7. Regulation 8 of the Immigration (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
    2006 was considered by the Court of  Appeal  in  the  case  of  Oboh  v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2013] EWCA Civ  1525  where
    at paragraph 46 that court made it clear that  the  domestic  provision
    was compliant and consistent with the scope  of  Article  3(2)  of  the
    relevant European Directive.  Mr Lam's submission before us is that  no
    proper regard was paid by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  the  relevant
    guidance to which we have drawn attention.  He submits  that  the  five
    categories to which we have made reference are in  the  alternative  to
    one another and that given that  his  case  falls  within  one  of  the
    categories he ought to have been granted the relevant  residence  card.
    However, Mr Lam, with respect to him needs to read on  to  the  end  of
    paragraph 2.4 of the first part of  the  guidance  on  extended  family
    members because there we see the following:

         "The guidance on assessing if extended family members can be issued
         with a document confirming their right of residence - see chapter 5
         of the ECIs."

 8. We have looked at chapter 5 of the ECIs, in particular section  5.1.13,
    and there is clear reference to Regulation 8 of the  2006  Regulations.
    In other words all that the guidance does is to provide  the  framework
    for consideration of an application for a residence card, it  does  not
    add to Regulation 8(2), still less does it contradict it.  That in  any
    event would be a somewhat surprising conclusion.

 9. The authority of Dauhoo is authority for the proposition that there are
    four different ways in which a person can establish an entitlement to a
    residence card under Regulation 8(2),  and  this  appellant  failed  to
    establish a good case under all four  of  them.   In  our  judgment  he
    cannot seek to rely on the Secretary of State's  guidance  which  after
    all is only loose textured instructions to caseworkers as to  how  they
    should approach the  consideration  of  cases  under  Regulation  8  as
    overriding the clear terms of that Regulation.  In short, with  regret,
    we have to conclude that there is no merit in this  appeal  and  it  is
    therefore dismissed.
