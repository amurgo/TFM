                            DECISION AND REASONS



     1. The appellant appeals with  permission  a  decision  of  First-tier
        Tribunal Judge Henderson who,  in  a  decision  promulgated  on  23
        August 2019, dismissed the appellant's appeal against the  decision
        of the Secretary of State to revoke his refugee status.




Background

     2. The appellant was born on 29th June 1983 in Iran. He arrived in the
        United Kingdom on  4  October  2009  and  was  encountered  working
        illegally on 28 October 2009. The appellant  claimed  asylum  on  7
        July 2010 and was granted refugee status and leave to  remain.  The
        appellant applied for settlement on 20 November 2013, 7 April 2014,
        19 November 2014, which were refused.  The appellant made a further
        application on 20 May 2015 which was granted.
     3. An application for naturalisation on 12 August 2016 was refused but
        referred for review, although on 10 January 2019 the appellant  was
        sent notification of intention  to  cease  his  refugee  status  in
        accordance with Article  1C  of  the  Refugee  Convention  and  the
        Immigration Rules.
     4. On 29th January 2019 the appellant was notified of the respondent's
        intention to cease his refugee status. There is reference to  UNHCR
        being informed and of their  response  of  18  February  2019.  The
        decision to cease refugee status was  made  on  25  February  2019,
        against which the appellant appealed.
     5. The Judge had the benefit of seeing and hearing oral evidence being
        given before setting out her findings of  fact  from  [22]  of  the
        decision under challenge.
     6. The Judge notes that it was not disputed  that  the  appellant  was
        granted asylum in August 2010 on the basis of  his  claim  to  have
        provided active support for the opposition, led by Mr Musavi [23].
     7. The Judge also noted that it was not in dispute that the  appellant
        had made several applications for settlement, but that he had  also
        obtained a national passport of Iran issued in London valid from 20
        January 2014. The Judge noted,  the  respondent  claimed  that  the
        appellant had failed to complete the section  on  possession  of  a
        national passport when  he  completed  his  final  application  for
        settlement on 20 May 2015 [23].
     8. The Judge noted however that at the time  of  the  application  for
        citizenship on 12 August 2016 the appellant  gave  details  of  his
        Iranian passport and three trips he had made to Iran  on  9  August
        2015 for 10 days, 10 November 2015 for 14 days and  from  21  April
        2016 for 27 days;  although  the  Judge  noted  the  appellant  had
        claimed this was a trip that lasted for two months [23].
     9. The Judge further noted the appellant's witness statement  provided
        information about further trips to  Iran  in  March  2017  for  six
        weeks, then on unspecified dates but a further visit of five  weeks
        at the beginning of 2018, in June 2018 for two  weeks,  in  October
        2018 for two weeks and a three week visit  in  November  2018.  The
        Judge noted it was not disputed that the appellant had  made  eight
        trips to Iran since 2015 and that he  travelled  to  and  from  the
        airport in Tabriz in Iran using an Iranian passport issued  in  his
        name by the Iranian authorities [23].
    10. The appellant claimed that the primary reason for his trips to Iran
        was to visit his elderly parents, and particularly his  mother  who
        had health problems. The Judge clearly considered the  evidence  in
        relation to this claim,  leading  to  a  finding  at  [26]  in  the
        following terms:

        "26.      I accept that the Appellant has been concerned about  the
             health of his parents as they live so  far  away  from  him.  I
             accept that the distance would be likely to  increase  concerns
             and the fact that he had not seen them for some time. It cannot
             be said however that they are both very elderly, or in  extreme
             ill health or that every trip was necessitated by their illness
             and the condition of his parents. This is not borne out by  the
             documents provided by the Appellant regarding their  health  or
             their age. The Appellant's mother is now aged in her early 60s,
             and there is no information on the age of his father."

    11. At [28] the Judge finds there was no medical evidence to show  that
        the appellant's parents suddenly became ill or  that  their  health
        suddenly deteriorated  in  2015  leading  to  it  being  found  "my
        assessment is that this is when the appellant felt able to  travel,
        having obtained permanent settlement in this  country."  The  Judge
        analyses the chronology, noting that the appellant first  travelled
        to Iran on 10 August 2015  after  he  had  been  granted  permanent
        settlement on 22 July 2015 and that he used the  passport  obtained
        from the Iranian authorities in January 2015 to travel to Iran. The
        Judge specifically finds in this paragraph that  "The  trigger  for
        the timing of the visit was not the sudden illness  of  his  mother
        and father, but the grant of permanent settlement".
    12. The Judge also noted that the appellant had  been  married  on  two
        occasions in Iran since 2015, with the first marriage  arranged  by
        his  mother  proving  unsuccessful.  The  Judge  also   noted   the
        appellant's evidence that he travelled to Iran in  March  2016  and
        married for the second time then. The Judge notes  the  appellant's
        first wife applied for a spouse visa which was refused  and  refers
        to divorce proceedings. The Judge noted that the second marriage is
        recorded as being entered in the Mianeh Family Court in Iran  on  8
        January  2018,  with  there  being  no  evidence  provided  of  any
        application by his second wife to come to the United Kingdom [29].
    13. The appellant also claimed before the Judge that it was  safer  for
        him to travel to Iran as a result of an error  in  the  information
        held by the authorities, who he claimed raided his home immediately
        after he left Iran [29] and that his father had contacted a  friend
        who worked at Tabriz airport to confirm that it was not the correct
        date of birth or his father's name  on  the  records  held  by  the
        authorities in Iran. The Judge rejected this claim finding that the
        passport information, including the date of birth of the appellant,
        corresponded with his correct details and noted that if the alleged
        error existed there was no reason why his passport was issued  with
        his correct date of birth rather than the  incorrect  details.  The
        Judge also  noted  the  appellant's  applications  for  an  Iranian
        passport were made in the United Kingdom which would  raise  issues
        about his circumstances in the UK and reasons for  applying  for  a
        passport from here and not in Iran. The Judge records  this  matter
        was raised with the appellant, who stated in his oral evidence that
        he went to the Iranian embassy to  apply  but  could  not  remember
        exactly what response the Iranians had given when he told them that
        he left Iran illegally [31]. The Judge clearly had doubts regarding
        this claim and refers to noting  the  expert  evidence  in  several
        country guidance cases on the  issue  of  leaving  Iran  illegally,
        including SHH and HR (illegal exit: failed asylum seeker)  Iran  CG
        [2016] UKUT 00308(IAC), the head noted which reads in part:

        An Iranian  male  in  respect  of  whom  no  adverse  interest  has
        previously been manifested by the Iranian State  does  not  face  a
        real risk of persecution/breach of his Article 3 rights  on  return
        to Iran on account of having left Iran  illegally  and/or  being  a
        failed  asylum  seeker.   No  such  risk  exists  at  the  time  of
        questioning on return to Iran nor after the facts (i.e. of  illegal
        exit and being a failed asylum seeker) have been  established.   In
        particular, there is not a real  risk  of  prosecution  leading  to
        imprisonment.

        This guidance indicates  that  if  the  appellant  did  advise  the
        authorities that he left Iran illegally as  he  claims,  for  which
        there does not appear to be any adverse consequence, and  that  the
        appellant was granted the passports he applied  for,  there  is  no
        adverse interest manifested in him by the Iranian State.
    14. The Judge noted the response from the UNHCR following  notification
        by the Secretary of State of the intention to cease the appellant's
        refugee status at [32 - 35] before concluding at [36]:

        "36.      There are factual difficulties with the  assessment  made
             by the UNHCR. The evidence before me does not suggest that  the
             Appellant's mother's  condition  was  life-threatening  at  the
             point that he first decided to travel to Iran. I have  accepted
             that he was concerned about his parents, having not  seen  them
             for over five years and I do not dispute that  his  mother  has
             been unwell, and he wanted to return to see  her.  The  medical
             evidence provided however , does not present in  the  way  that
             the Appellant's previous solicitors set out  in  terms  of  the
             urgency of the visits in 2015 and 2016. The Appellant  has  now
             made eight visits over three years and has renewed his passport
             with the Iranian authorities. It is not clear  that  the  UNHCR
             appreciated the precise number of visits,  were  aware  of  the
             medical evidence about the Appellant's  mother's  condition  or
             the fact that the Appellant renewed his Iranian passport."

    15. Having assessed the evidence, the Judge writes  in  the  concluding
        paragraphs, the following:

        "37.      The Appellant has married twice on the trips he has  made
             to Iran and it cannot be said that  the  visits  he  made  were
             solely to care for elderly parents. It cannot be said  that  he
             was the only possible  child  who  could  care  for  them.  His
             younger sister was living with his parents  when  he  made  the
             first visit. He has another four sisters all resident in  Iran.
             They may be living some distance away but not the distance  the
             Appellant has to travel to see his parents or to take the risks
             he is alleging he takes in returning to see his parents. Whilst
             I accept that he wanted to return to see his parents  after  an
             absence. I do not accept that this was something which could be
             classed as an in voluntary act or that he  was  constrained  by
             circumstances beyond his control on each of  the  eight  visits
             made over the period of over three years.


        38.  I am invited to consider that the Appellant is a risk taker. I
             accept that the Appellant  has  shown  great  bravery  in  this
             country and was commended  for  his  actions  by  the  Honorary
             Recorder  of  Carlisle  His  Honour   Judge   Batty   QC.   The
             commendation was made because the Appellant disarmed  an  armed
             man outside his takeaway shop. The armed man was  found  guilty
             of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear  or  violence
             as well as a number  of  other  offences  including  theft  and
             racially  aggravated  assault.  This  is  consistent  with  the
             background of the Appellant in the risks he took as a political
             activist, facts  which  were  accepted  by  the  Respondent  in
             granting him asylum.


        39.  The Appellant has made regular family visits to Iran  using  a
             passport issued by the Iranian authorities  after  he  made  an
             application through their embassy in London.  For  the  reasons
             given by accept that he has voluntarily availed himself of  the
             protection of the Iranian authorities.


        40.  I have not at this stage, made an assessment  of  the  current
             human rights situation in Iran as I accept that this appeal  is
             limited to the  decision  on  whether  or  not  to  revoke  the
             Appellant's refugee status and at present there is no  decision
             to remove him to Iran."

    16. The appellant sought permission  to  appeal,  which  was  initially
        refused by another judge of the First-tier Tribunal, but granted by
        a judge of  the  Upper  Tribunal  on  a  renewed  application,  the
        operative part of the grant being in the following terms:

        "2.   The  renewed  grounds  challenge  the  First-tier  Tribunal's
             dismissal of the appeal against revocation of  refugee  status;
             which followed the appellant's obtaining of an Iranian passport
             after obtaining permanent residency in the UK and his return to
             Iran using his own identity on no  less  than  eight  occasions
             between 2015 and 2018, during which visits he had twice entered
             into marriage. The judge  concluded  that  he  had  voluntarily
             availed himself of the protection of the Iranian authorities.


        3.   It is argued that the First-tier Tribunal Judge failed to take
             cognizance of the fact that the appellant returned to  Iran  to
             support his ill mother. However, that was fully  considered  by
             the judge.


        4.   It is just arguable that by his returns to Iran to support his
             mother the appellant had not voluntarily availed himself of the
             protection of the Iranian authorities but was running a risk in
             each return. I found the  otherwise  careful  decision  of  the
             First-tier Tribunal Judge seems to have come to a rather abrupt
             conclusion with little in the way of supportive  reasoning.  It
             is arguable that the appellant had not  re-established  himself
             or been in contact with the authorities so as  to  justify  the
             triggering of the cessation clause. The arguments may be  weak,
             but given the seriousness of  the  risk,  there  is  enough  to
             demonstrate an arguable material error of law."

    17. A skeleton argument submitted on behalf  of  the  appellant  by  Ms
        Cleghorn, dated 5 June 2020 reads:

        'Skeleton Argument


        7.   Although the Refugee Convention provides for the cessation  of
             refugee status in a variety of circumstances, there is only one
             power under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 to
             revoke indefinite leave to remain given to  a  person  who  has
             been recognised as a refugee if that  person  ceases  to  be  a
             refugee. One of the four circumstances set out  in  Section  76
             (3) of the 2002 Act. These are:


             a) voluntarily re-availing himself of  the  protection  of  his
                country of nationality,


             b) voluntary re-acquiring a lost nationality,


             c) acquiring the nationality of  the  country  other  than  the
                United Kingdom and availing himself of its protection, or


             d) voluntarily, establishing himself in a country in respect of
                which he was a refugee.


        8.   In this case, the Respondent relies on  section  76  (3)  (a),
             i.e. that the Appellant has voluntarily availed himself of  the
             protection  of  Iran;  the  main  argument   being   that   the
             Appellant's conduct in making trips back to Iran is  sufficient
             for the Respondent  to  justify  the  decision  to  revoke  the
             appellant's ILR in  the  UK.  No  challenge  was  made  to  the
             credibility of  the  core  of  the  Appellant's  asylum  claim.
             Section 76 (3) of the 2002 act mirrors. Article 1  (3)  (a)  of
             the Refugee Convention.


        9.   Consistent with the approach taken by the Court of  Appeal  in
             Arif v SSHD [1999] EWCA Civ 808, the burden of proof is on  the
             Respondent. That appeal concerned  a  person  who  applied  for
             asylum in about July  1992.  His  application  was  refused  in
             October  1994  as  allowed  by   Special   Adjudicator   in   a
             determination promulgated in March 1997. In December  1997  the
             Immigration   Appeal   Tribunal    overturned    the    Special
             Adjudicator's decision. There were two grounds  raised  by  the
             Secretary of State in his  attack.  The  second  was  that  the
             appellant was in fact safe because the government  had  changed
             at the end of June 1996,  that  is,  after  the  appellant  had
             claimed asylum, and before the Special  Adjudicator  heard  and
             decided the appeal. The Tribunal was attracted to that argument
             but the Court of Appeal said that the Tribunal was  wrong.  The
             Special Adjudicator had quoted with approval  the  addition  of
             Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practice that "proof  that  the
             circumstances of the persecution have  ceased  to  exist,  will
             fall  upon  the  receiving  State".  As  the  Court  of  Appeal
             explained, on the facts of that case, there was  an  evidential
             burden  on  the  Secretary  of  State  to  establish  that  the
             appellant could safely be returned home. Establishing a  change
             of circumstances was not enough.


        10.  In applying Arif, the Tribunal in  RD  (Cessation,  burden  of
             proof, procedure) acknowledge  that  the  fact  that  a  person
             volunteers  to  avail  himself  of  the  protection  does   not
             necessarily mean that he considers himself to be safe  in  that
             country, although obviously his safety, or likely  safety,  may
             be a guide to his real intentions. The panel continued later to
             also acknowledge that [38]:


                 "It is quite right that even a short visit  to  a  country
                 does not necessarily mean that a person intends  to  avail
                 himself  of  the  protection  of  that  country  and  some
                 superficial contact with the authorities of  that  country
                 does not necessarily amount to availing the protection  of
                 that country"


        11.  The panel went on to conclude, in line with paragraph  121  of
             the UNHCR Handbook, whereas passport is obtained,  it  will  be
             assumed that  he  or  she  intends  to  avail  himself  of  the
             protection of the  state  that  issued  the  passport  and  the
             Respondent takes a similar position in this case and  that  his
             actions have created a rebuttable presumption.


        12.  It is submitted that the UNHCR Handbook is merely the starting
             point which has subsequently been the focus of further analysis
             by academics if not sufficiently in case law. A  paper  on  the
             issue, titled 'Current Issues in Cessation of Protection  Under
             Article 1C of the 1951 Refugee Convention in Article 1.4 of the
             1969 OAU Convention clarifies the application of  the  relevant
             parts of the Refugee Convention and states, inter-alia,


                  With respect to Article 1 C (1)-(4) of the  1951  Refugee
                 Convention (and the parallel Article. 1.4 (a) - (d) of the
                 OAU Refugee Convention), the  elements  of  voluntariness,
                 intent, and effective protection are crucial, and  require
                 careful  analysis  of  the  individual's  motivations  and
                 assessment of the bone  fide's  and  capacities  of  State
                 authorities. Procedural  mechanisms  requiring  States  to
                 prove  the  elimination  of  persecutory  risk  prior   to
                 cessation will protect against  unfounded  termination  of
                 refugee status.


                 ...


                  Paragraph 119 of the Handbook  sets  out  an  appropriate
                 analytical framework for the consideration of such  cases,
                 arising under Article 1C(1):  voluntariness,  intent,  and
                 actual re-availment. Other contact with  State  of  origin
                 diplomatic  missions  should  be   analysed   under   this
                 framework. Since Article 1 C (1) anticipates  that  return
                 to the State of origin may result, the stakes are high for
                 a recognised refugee who has had contact  with  diplomatic
                 representatives of the State of origin. Proof of  the  act
                 can permissibly impose an obligation  on  the  refugee  to
                 explain his or  her  conduct,  because  voluntariness  and
                 intent are largely unknowable without the testimony of the
                 individual concerned. The refugee may also possess crucial
                 evidence  pertaining  to  the  availability  (or  not)  of
                 effective national protection in the State of origin.


                 ...


                 The refugees of voluntary acts, intent, and attitudes  may
                 be considered, but they cannot pre-dominate over political
                 reality. The cessation clauses should not  be  transformed
                 into a trap for the unwary or a penalty for risky or na�ve
                 conduct.


                 ...


                 The State seeking to impose cessation  of  refugee  status
                 must prove that the refugee in question intended to  avail
                 himself  or  herself  of  national  protection  and   that
                 effective protection is in fact available from  the  State
                 of origin.


                 ...


                 The  element  of  voluntariness,  intent,  and   effective
                 protection  are  vital  in  re-establishment  cases.   Re-
                 establishment denotes transfer of primary residence with a
                 subjective re-affiliation to the State of  origin,  rather
                 than brief visits.


        13.  In line with the Panel in RD then, the writers  of  the  UNHCR
             paper, acknowledge that a short visit to  a  country  does  not
             necessarily mean that a person intends to avail himself of  the
             protection of that country. In this case, the Appellant has not
             demonstrated any intention, explicit or inferred, to  resume  a
             normal relationship  with  Iran.  Return  in  itself  does  not
             justify the cessation of  status  and  loss  of  protection  in
             circumstances  such  as  these.  It  is  submitted   that   the
             Respondent was demonstrate that, while the return may have been
             voluntary,  is  re-establishment  requires  both  a  subjective
             reaffiliation as well as an objectively  durable  presence.  In
             this case,  the  visits  were  short  in  nature,  his  primary
             residence remained in the UK, his business in the UK continued,
             his return to Iran was for legitimate  and  compelling  reasons
             and in the face of a continued risk of persecution. Nothing  in
             his  behaviour  indicated  an  intention  to  enjoy  a   normal
             relationship with  Iran.  In  fact,  it  is  submitted  that  a
             'normal' relationship with Iran will be  impossible  given  the
             accepted background information i.e. that the  situation  which
             justify the granting of refugee status still  exists  with  the
             Status persecutor.


        14.  The Appellant further relies on an Austrian Supreme Court case
             of VwGH No. 2001/01/0499, Austria: Supreme Administrative Court
             (Verwaltungsgerichtshof), 15 May 2003. It will be  noted  that,
             in this decision, reference is made to various other  resources
             that will be helpful to obtain in advance of an  oral  hearing.
             It is submitted that, in line with the view of Grahl-Madsen, 'a
             Refugee filled in his opinion, lose refugee status and  at  the
             same time regain status as an alien  possessing  the  effective
             nationality of the country of nationality only if,  "with  full
             knowledge of the consequences, he submits his passport  to  the
             authorities of his new country of residence and requests a visa
             so that he may continue his stay in that country as a  national
             of his country of origin."  Reference in the  Austrian  Supreme
             Court  decision  is  also  made   to   Hathaways   and   'three
             requirements'.


                 These three requirements are also adopted by  Goodwin-Gill
                 (The Refugee in International Law 2  (1996),  p.80ff)  and
                 Hathaway (The Law  of  Refugee  Status  (1991),  p.192ff).
                 Goodwin-Gill also advocates a presumption of  re-availment
                 in passport cases makes however reference to an  extensive
                 number  of  aspects  which   have   to   be   taken   into
                 consideration and accords  particular  importance  to  the
                 question which documents have been issued by the state  of
                 residence.  Hathaway   speaks   of   actions   which   can
                 "technically" be  interpreted  as  re-availment  of  state
                 protection and thus allow for  a  respective  presumption.
                 But it was only a fiction to  believe  that  more  than  a
                 evanescent percentage  of  all  those  who  addressed  the
                 consulates of their countries of nationality would thereby
                 manifest their political  loyalty  or  trust.  This  would
                 normally take place out of mere  practical  necessity  all
                 routine "with no thought to the  legal  ramifications".  A
                 strict  interpretation  of  this  cessation   clause   was
                 consequently required. It was  necessary  to  examine  the
                 reasons for this particular action. Article 1C (1) of  the
                 Refugee Convention could only be applied where  a  refugee
                 had  indeed  intended  to  again  entrust's   country   of
                 nationality with the protection of his interests.


        15.  Again, it cannot be said, in the Appellant's  case,  that  the
             Appellant while fearing the state, had intended to entrust  his
             country of nationality with the protection  of  his  interests.
             All of the background evidence demonstrates that the passage of
             time in itself does not lessen the interest of authorities  and
             those that had previously come to the attention of the Regime.


        16.  Moreover, it is clear that "the cessation clauses  should  not
             be transformed into a trap for the  unwary  or  a  penalty  for
             risky or na�ve  conduct."  The  fact  that  the  Appellant  has
             managed to find a way to  return  to  Iran,  clandestinely,  to
             visit his sick  mother,  demonstrates  naivety  rather  than  a
             decision to re-avail himself of the  protection  of  Iran.  The
             Austrian Supreme Court (ibid) concluded that:


                 With reference to this stage of discussion -  and  insofar
                 this in line with previous judicial practice - the  Higher
                 Administrative Court takes  the  legal  opinion  that  the
                 successful application for the issuance  or  extension  of
                 validity of a passport of the country of  nationality  can
                 lead to a cessation  of  refugee  status,  even  when  the
                 danger of persecution remains in the country of origin and
                 a return there is not envisaged. That  will  be  the  case
                 where a recognised refugee insists  on  using  a  passport
                 issued by the authorities of the  country  of  nationality
                 for purposes for  which  the  Convention  travel  document
                 would suffice or where a refugee wants to gain  advantages
                 bound by nationality by applying for  the  issuance  of  a
                 passport. However, contrary to judicial practice taken  up
                 under the former Asylum Laws. In addition to voluntariness
                 and re-availment the additional requirement of intent,  as
                 argued by all scholars is decisive. An intent to normalise
                 relations to the country of origin as mentioned by  Grahl-
                 Madsen  and  to  again  entrust  that  country,  with  the
                 representation of one's interests will normally be missing
                 as long as (in particular: state), persecution prevails.


        17.  It is therefore submitted that, as a matter of  common  sense,
             and given the prevailing country conditions, if the core  facts
             of the original asylum claim are not  disputed  and  there  has
             been no change in regime, then the persecution remains.  It  is
             accepted that the same could not necessarily be said  for  many
             other countries in the world but the Iran is unique in terms of
             state-sponsored  persecution  and   intelligent   system   that
             dominates its surveillance of its nationals thus leading, it is
             submitted,  to  the  incontrovertible   conclusion   that   the
             persecution was still remain until there is  a  change  in  the
             regime.


        18.  This point  was  discussed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  MS
             (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345, accepted the points. The  House
             of Laws made clear in [70] of Hoxha, that it must be shown that
             the change in circumstances are fundamental and durable (in the
             equivalent   wording   of    the    Qualification    Directive,
             "significant" and "non-temporary") for cessation to  apply.  It
             is submitted that demonstrate the change  in  circumstances  is
             both 'fundamental' and 'durable' evidence will be required that
             the changes are  substantial,  in  the  sense  that  the  power
             structure under which persecution was deemed a real possibility
             no longer exists; effective, in the sense that  they  exist  in
             fact, rather than simply promise, and reflected genuine ability
             and willingness on the part of the home countries,  authorities
             to protect the refugee; and  durable,  rather  than  transitory
             shifts which last only a few weeks or months.


        19.  The cessation clauses based on 'ceased circumstances'  mean  a
             careful assessment of the fundamental character of the  changes
             in the country of nationality or origin, including the  general
             human rights situation, as well as the particular cause of fear
             of persecution, in order to make sure that in an objective  and
             verifiable way that the situation which justified the  granting
             of refugee status has ceased to exist.  It  follows  then  that
             cessation based on "ceased circumstances" only comes into  play
             when changes have taken  place  which  address  the  causes  of
             displacement which led to the recognition  of  refugee  status.
             This is clearly not the case in this Appellant's case.'

    18. The Secretary of State opposes the appeal in her Rule  24  response
        dated to 19 May 2020 where it is written:

        'Submissions


          1. The relevant legislative framework to cease Refugee  Status  is
             as follows:


             Para 339A, of the Rules  is  clear  that  the  SoS  has  to  be
             satisfied that one or more of the following are applicable.


             i) Voluntary re-availing themselves of the  protection  of  the
                country of nationality;


            ii)  Having  lost  their  nationality,  they  have   voluntarily
                reacquired it;


           iii) They have acquired a new nationality (n/a here);


            iv) They  have  voluntarily  re-established  themselves  in  the
                country which they left (etc. n/a here);


             v) They can no longer, because the circumstances in which  they
                have been recognised as a  refugee,  have  ceased  to  exist
                (etc. n/a here);


            vi) Being a stateless person etc. (n/a here);


             (v) and (vi) significant and non-temporary


          2. It is clear that when analysed the Immigration Rules make clear
             that it is one or more of the above sub paragraphs that have to
             be satisfied. It is submitted that the appellant satisfies  (i)
             and (ii) of Para 338A, of the Rules set out above.


          3. The Appellant's  skeleton  argument  firstly  claims  that  the
             Respondent had failed to discharge the burden of proof that the
             appellant had voluntarily re-availed himself of the country  of
             his nationality. This proposition is not made out,  FTT,  Judge
             Henderson made clear findings that the  appellant  had  made  8
             trips to Iran on 2 separately issued Iranian passports, between
             2015 and 2018, and that these visits took place  by  him  using
             his validly issued passports travelling through the airport  in
             Tabriz. The FTT Judge did not accept a belated explanation made
             by the appellant that his name and date of birth were  recorded
             differently by  the  authorities  in  Iran.  [Para  30  of  the
             decision]. The  Respondent  submits  that  the  Respondent  has
             discharge the burden of proof, as set  out  by  the  FTT  Judge
             Henderson.


          4. Contrary to paragraph 7 (a) and (b) of  the  skeleton  argument
             the acquisition of the Iranian passports and his travels there,
             show that the FTT did apply the correct standard  of  proof  to
             the case.


          5. Paragraph 7 (c) of the appellant's skeleton  argument  suggests
             that FTT Judge Henderson failed to fully take into account  the
             views of the UNHCR in coming to her conclusion. It is submitted
             that in Paragraphs 32-36 the FTT did fully consider  the  views
             of UNHCR, but  noted  that  the  appellant's  mother's  medical
             condition had been  described  to  UNHCR  as  life  threatening
             (which had not been made out in  the  medical  evidence  before
             her) and that it was not clear whether  the  amount  of  visits
             made by the appellant to Iran had been made clear to UNHCR.  It
             is submitted that FTT Judge Henderson was entitled to  conclude
             that UNHCR had made recommendations on the basis of limited  or
             flawed information.


          6. Paragraph 13 of the appellant's skeleton argument sets out  the
             case of MA (Somalia) [2018] EWCA Civ  994  and  points  to  the
             following passage:-


                 'a cessation decision is the mirror image  of  a  decision
                 determining refugee  status.  By  that  I  mean  that  the
                 grounds for cessation do not go beyond  verifying  whether
                 the grounds for recognising refugee  status  exist.  Thus,
                 the  relevant  question  is  whether  there  has  been   a
                 significant and non-temporary change in  circumstances  so
                 that the circumstances which caused the  person  to  be  a
                 refugee, have ceased, and there is no other basis on which
                 he would be held to be a refugee'.


          7. The other case law quoted speaks in similar terms to changes in
             circumstances; such as those which were examined at  length  in
             MA Somalia as to whether there has been a durable change in the
             circumstances of the home country such that  the  circumstances
             that led to the grant of refugee status no longer apply. It  is
             submitted that in this case, the Respondent  has  never  argued
             that this case was Cessation as a result of durable  change  in
             the country of origin;  it  has  been  entirely  based  on  the
             appellant's individual actions.


          8. The skeleton argument also refers to the UNHCR Cessation clause
             Guidelines  which  are  set  out  at  pages  16  -  25  of  the
             appellant's bundle. The respondent would point to the  Tribunal
             to the section entitled Voluntary Re-availing of the Protection
             of the Country of Nationality, and in particular Paragraph 6  -
             11 of the Guidelines [pages 17 and 18  of  appellant's  bundle]
             -there is no  evidence  the  appellant  has  been  required  to
             approach the Iranian authorities or compelled in  circumstances
             outside his control. It is also clear when looking at Paragraph
             10 of the guidelines that the  key  issue  is  the  purpose  or
             reason for which the passport was obtained or renewed -  it  is
             clear in this case the appellant intended to use  the  passport
             to travel to Iran and did so.


          9. The respondent also invites the Tribunal to consider Para 13 of
             the UNHCR guidelines - [page 18 of appellant's bundle] in  that
             the  voluntary  re-acquisition  of  nationality  is  a   'clear
             indication that there is a normalisation of  the  bond  between
             the refugee and the government in relation to which he  or  she
             has a well-founded fear of persecution.'


         10. Paragraph 19 of the appellant's skeleton argument submits  that
             the mere possession of a passport, does not constitute that the
             appellant has re-availed himself. The  respondent  submits  the
             FTT Judge Henderson was entitled to conclude that the appellant
             had done so, such that his remaining family in Iran were unable
             to look after them. She therefore found the acquisition of  the
             passports and the 8 stays in Iran with therefore voluntary acts
             by the appellant.


         11. The respondent submits that the FTT made no material errors  in
             concluding  that  the  appellant  had  voluntarily   re-availed
             himself of his nationality. In the circumstances  she  did  not
             have to decide the 'durable  change'  point,  contrary  to  the
             appellant's skeleton argument.


         12. In Paragraph 4 of the grant of permission to  appeal  by  Upper
             Tribunal Judge  Macleman  (sic)  there  is  comment  about  the
             question of the risks attached to  the  appellant's  return  to
             Iran. It is submitted that FTT Judge Henderson did  not  accept
             the appellant's claim that these are used a different  name  to
             the one recorded by the Iranian authorities, or that he  had  a
             friend at the airport who was able to assist  him  in  entering
             and leaving Iran. The respondent would also point out that  the
             appellant has, since  2015  marriage  twice  in  Iran  and  got
             divorced, which would indicate that he  also  had  interactions
             with the civil/religious authorities in Iran  as  well  as  the
             claimed visits to his parents.


        Conclusion


         13. The respondent submits that no material errors of law are  made
             out in the grounds of appeal such that the determination should
             be set aside.

    19. A further document, described as a supplementary skeleton  argument
        filed by Ms Cleghorn reads:

        ____________________________________________________________

                  SUPPLEMENTARY SKELETON FOR THE APPELLANT
        ____________________________________________________________

        Introduction


          1. This skeleton argument should be read in conjunction  with  the
             submissions previously made.


        Developments in Law


          2. Since the document, on  behalf  of  the  Appellant  during  the
             'lockdown' last year, the case of Secretary of  State  for  the
             Home Department v. OA, European Union: Court of Justice of the
             European Union, 20 January 2021 has been promulgated.[1] While
             OA deals with Article 11(1)(e) of Council Directive  2004/83/EC
             as opposed to what would be, in this case Article  11(1)(d)  of
             Council Directive 2004/83/EC it is submitted that  it  supports
             the general arguments made in  favour  of  this  Appellant  and
             creates principles of general application. This is particularly
             in the relative availability of jurisprudence on this issue. In
             OA,  the  Court  observed  that  in  any  examination   of   an
             application for refugee status, one  must  address  whether  an
             applicant had established a well-founded fear  of  persecution,
             which requires an objective examination of whether or not there
             is  protection  available  in  the   applicant's   country   of
             nationality, and whether the  individual  has  access  to  said
             protection. The continued need for international protection  is
             determined by the ability of the relevant actor to  take  steps
             to prevent persecution of the applicant at  the  hand  of  non-
             state actors.  To  ascertain  this  fear  of  persecution,  the
             availability of protection by actors, as described  in  Article
             7(2) QD, must be considered and the same analysis  applied  for
             the cessation of refugee  status  in  accordance  with  Article
             11(1)(e) QD. At �36, it is stated:


                 36. Thus, the circumstances which demonstrate the  country
                 of origin's  inability  or,  conversely,  its  ability  to
                 provide protection from acts of persecution  constitute  a
                 crucial element in the assessment which leads to the grant
                 of refugee status, or, correspondingly, when  appropriate,
                 to the cessation  of  that  status.  Such  cessation  thus
                 implies that the change in circumstances has remedied  the
                 reasons which led to the  recognition  of  refugee  status
                 (judgment of 2 March 2010, Salahadin Abdulla and Others, C-
                 175/08, C-176/08, C-178/08  and  C-179/08,  EU:C:2010:105,
                 paragraphs 68 and 69).


                 37. Given the parallelism established by Directive 2004/83
                 between the granting and the cessation of refugee  status,
                 the requirements to be met by  the  protection  which  may
                 preclude that status, in the context of  Article  2(c)  of
                 that directive, or bring about its cessation, pursuant  to
                 Article 11(1)(e) thereof, must be the same as those  which
                 arise from, in particular, Article 7(1) and  (2)  of  that
                 directive.


                 38. In order to arrive at the conclusion that the fear  of
                 persecution of the refugee concerned  is  no  longer  well
                 founded,  the  competent  authorities,  in  the  light  of
                 Article 7(2) of Directive  2004/83,  must  verify,  having
                 regard to that refugee's individual  situation,  that  the
                 actor or actors in question who are providing  protection,
                 within the meaning of Article 7(1), have taken  reasonable
                 steps to prevent  the  persecution,  that  they  therefore
                 operate, inter alia, an effective  legal  system  for  the
                 detection, prosecution and punishment of acts constituting
                 persecution and that the third country national  concerned
                 will, if he or she ceases to  have  refugee  status,  have
                 access to that protection (see, to that  effect,  judgment
                 of 2 March 2010, Salahadin Abdulla and Others, C-175/08, C-
                 176/08, C-178/08 and C-179/08,  EU:C:2010:105,  paragraphs
                 70 and 74).


                 39. In the light of  the  foregoing,  the  answer  to  the
                 fourth question is  that  Article  11(1)(e)  of  Directive
                 2004/83  must  be  interpreted   as   meaning   that   the
                 requirements to be met by the 'protection' to  which  that
                 provision refers in relation to the cessation  of  refugee
                 status must be the same as those which arise, in  relation
                 to the granting of that status, from Article 2(c) of  that
                 directive,  read  together  with  Article  7(1)  and   (2)
                 thereof.


                 .........


                 52. Moreover, in so far as the  doubts  expressed  by  the
                 referring court were to be understood as  being  concerned
                 with establishing whether, to the extent that the clans in
                 Mogadishu may, in addition to their providing  social  and
                 financial support, also provide  protection  in  terms  of
                 security, such protection may be  taken  into  account  in
                 order to ascertain whether the protection provided by  the
                 State meets the requirements that  arise,  in  particular,
                 from  Article  7(2)  of  Directive  2004/83,  it  must  be
                 recalled that, for the purposes of determining  whether  a
                 refugee's fear of persecution is no longer  well  founded,
                 the actor or actors of protection with  respect  to  which
                 the reality of a change of circumstances in the country of
                 origin is to be assessed are, in accordance  with  Article
                 7(1)(a) and  (b)  of  that  directive,  either  the  State
                 itself,  or  the  parties  or   organisations,   including
                 international organisations, controlling the  State  or  a
                 substantial part of the territory of that State  (judgment
                 of 2 March 2010, Salahadin Abdulla and Others, C-175/08, C-
                 176/08, C-178/08 and  C-179/08,  EU:C:2010:105,  paragraph
                 74).


                 ..........


                 56. In  that  regard,  it  should  be  observed  that  the
                 conditions specified in Article 2(c) of Directive 2004/83,
                 in relation to the fear of persecution and to  protection,
                 are intrinsically linked. Indeed, the protection to  which
                 that provision refers is, as is stated in paragraph 47  of
                 the present judgment, protection from acts of persecution.




          3. So, while it can be said, that using one's own passport  of  is
             indicative of an individual  availing  the  protection  of  the
             authorities it is, but one, factor. It is not determinative. It
             can be  one  factor  that  may  result  in  a  conclusion  that
             circumstances have changed but it requires more. In making  any
             assessment, the question must be, whether obtaining a  passport
             actually indicates change. In this case it does not as the fear
             of persecution and to protection are intrinsically linked.  The
             Iranian regime remain repressive and are  continue  responsible
             for gross human  rights  violations.  If  anything,  the  human
             rights record of Iran has declined in recent years.


          4. It is submitted then, that there is a sliding  scale.  In  some
             cases, obtaining a passport and visiting a person's country  of
             origin may, in certain circumstances, be enough to infer that a
             person has voluntarily availed himself  of  the  protection  of
             his/her country. So, to take a recent example, when Abiy  Ahmed
             came to power in Ethiopia and invited many of the  diaspora  to
             return, it could be argued that those applying for a  Ethiopian
             passport,  and  choosing  to  go  to  Ethiopia,  and  who  were
             previously considered to  be  refugees  could  conceivably,  be
             considered to have availed themselves of the protection of  the
             Ethiopian authorities. But, this is quite  obviously,  not  the
             case here where the repression of the regime has only increased
             in recent years.


          5. In applying the above then, during the  Appellant's  occasional
             visits to Iran, he has been fine. However,  one  cannot  assume
             that he would be  fine  all  the  time  without  disputing  the
             reasons the Appellant left Iran. The visits show nothing  other
             than he has a well-practised method of avoiding  detection  and
             is willing to take significant risk for particular reasons.  It
             does not show he can safely live there and  integrate  for  any
             period. In fact, all the objective evidence would suggest  that
             he could not. In the case of K.I.  v  France (application  no.
             5560/19), which was a case  dealing  with  deportation,  it  is
             clear that there needs to be a judgment  call  looking  to  the
             future as to whether a person would be at  risk  of  harm  upon
             removal to their country of origin.[2]


          6. It is submitted  that  a  distinction  must  be  drawn  between
             choosing to take a risk and whether the risk  actually  exists.
             Cessation cannot be based simply on the basis that a person  is
             prepared to take extra-ordinary risks. The very basis on  which
             asylum is granted is the risk, and not, the fool  hardiness  of
             those people who are refugees.


          7. It is therefore submitted that the assessment must be based  on
             fact  and  not  what  risk,  an  appellant,  in  any   set   of
             circumstances, may be  prepared  to  take.  The  Appellant  has
             decided, rightly or wrongly to return to Iran, but it does  not
             change the fact he is taking a tremendous risk in doing  it  or
             that he would only have himself  to  blame  if  something  went
             wrong.


          8. Moreover, the case of OA refers back to the much  earlier  case
             of  Salahadin  Abdulla  and  Others,  C-175/08.  This   clearly
             envisages, what is in effect,  a  two  stage  test.  The  Grand
             Chamber  ruled  that  Article  11(1)(e)  of  Council  Directive
             2004/83/EC of 29  April  2004  on  minimum  standards  for  the
             qualification  and  status  of  third  country   nationals   or
             stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise  need
             international protection and  the  content  of  the  protection
             granted must be interpreted as meaning that:


                 38. The referring court takes the view  that  there  is  a
                 cessation of refugee status when, first, the situation  in
                 a refugee's country of origin has changed in a significant
                 and non-temporary manner and the circumstances  justifying
                 his fear of persecution, on the  basis  of  which  he  was
                 recognised as a refugee, have ceased to  exist  and  when,
                 secondly,  he  has  no  other   reason   to   fear   being
                 'persecuted' within  the  meaning  of  Article  2  (c)  of
                 Directive 2004/83.


                 39.  For  the  purposes   of   assessing   a   change   of
                 circumstances, the competent  authorities  of  the  Member
                 State  must  verify,  having  regard  to   the   refugee's
                 individual  situation,  that  the  actor  or   actors   of
                 protection  referred  to  in  Article  7(1)  of  Directive
                 2004/83  have  taken  reasonable  steps  to  prevent   the
                 persecution, that they therefore operate, inter  alia,  an
                 effective legal system for the detection, prosecution  and
                 punishment of acts constituting persecution and  that  the
                 national concerned will have access to such protection  if
                 he ceases to have refugee status;


          9. In the present case, there has been no change in the  refugee's
             country of origin. The circumstances  justifying  his  fear  of
             persecution on the basis on which he was recognised as refugee,
             continue to exist. Secondly,  the  competent  authorities  have
             clearly not verified, that the actors of protection have  taken
             reasonable steps  to  prevent  the  persecution  or  that  they
             operate  an  'effective  legal  system   for   the   detection,
             prosecution and punishment of acts constituting persecution and
             that the national concerned will have access to such protection
             if he ceases to have refugee status'. It is submitted that this
             is for the obvious reasons, this cannot and will not, be  done.
             The Grand Chamber then note:


                 68. In that way, the circumstances which  demonstrate  the
                 country of origin's inability or, conversely, its  ability
                 to  ensure  protection   against   acts   of   persecution
                 constitute a crucial element in the assessment which leads
                 to the granting of, or, as the case may be,  by  means  of
                 the opposite  conclusion,  to  the  cessation  of  refugee
                 status.


                 .....


                 70 In order to arrive at the conclusion that the refugee's
                 fear of being persecuted is no longer  well  founded,  the
                 competent authorities, by reference to Article 7(2) of the
                 Directive, must verify, having  regard  to  the  refugee's
                 individual  situation,  that  the  actor  or   actors   of
                 protection of the third country  in  question  have  taken
                 reasonable steps to prevent  the  persecution,  that  they
                 therefore operate, inter alia, an effective  legal  system
                 for the detection,  prosecution  and  punishment  of  acts
                 constituting persecution and that the  national  concerned
                 will have access to such protection if he ceases  to  have
                 refugee status.


                 71 That verification means that the competent  authorities
                 must assess, in particular, the  conditions  of  operation
                 of, on the one hand,  the  institutions,  authorities  and
                 security forces and, on the other, all groups or bodies of
                 the third country which may, by their action or  inaction,
                 be  responsible  for  acts  of  persecution  against   the
                 recipient of refugee status if he returns to that country.
                 In accordance with Article 4(3) of the Directive, relating
                 to  the  assessment  of  facts  and  circumstances,  those
                 authorities may take into account, inter  alia,  the  laws
                 and regulations of the country of origin and the manner in
                 which they are applied, and  the  extent  to  which  basic
                 human rights are guaranteed in that country.


                 72 Furthermore, Article 11(2) of  the  Directive  provides
                 that the change of circumstances recorded by the competent
                 authorities must  be  'of  such  a  significant  and  non-
                 temporary nature' that the refugee's fear  of  persecution
                 can no longer be regarded as well founded.


         10. In this case, it is submitted that the  Respondent  has  fallen
             far short of her obligations/  what  would  be  necessary  when
             considering cessation of Refugee Status.

Error of law

    20. Although the approach of the Secretary of State  is  criticised  in
        the appellant's pleadings it is  important  to  remember  that  the
        decision under challenge is that of the First-tier Tribunal.
    21. The appellant was granted refugee status as it was accepted at  the
        time, in 2010, he faced a real risk as a result of his support  for
        the opposition politician known as Musavi and the Green Movement in
        Iran.  He was never detained by the authorities but claimed that he
        had escaped before he was arrested.
    22. The appellant's claim to face such a risk in 2009 was  accepted  as
        being credible to the lower standard  applicable  to  a  protection
        appeal. Information available  in  the  public  domain  shows  that
        Mousavi  held  very  prominent   positions   within   the   Iranian
        government, including  providing  advice  to  previous  presidents,
        before retiring from politics. He returned to the political  sphere
        to run for president  in  the  election  of  2009  and  during  his
        campaign was vocally critical of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and
        his policies.
    23. Voter turnout at the election in mid-June was  estimated  to  be  a
        record high and Mousavi, who claimed he had been contacted  by  the
        interior ministry to inform him of his victory, announced  that  he
        had  won  the  election  outright  by  a  large  margin.    Shortly
        thereafter, however,  officials  made  a  similar  announcement  in
        favour of President Ahmadinejad.
    24. Mousavi urged his supporters to protest the results,  and,  in  the
        days following the election, demonstrations unfolded in the capital
        and elsewhere. Ayatollah Khamenei called for an official inquiry by
        the  Council  of  Guardians  into  the  allegations  of   electoral
        irregularities which resulted in a partial recount, a  motion  that
        fell short of the annulment the opposition had sought.
    25. On June 19, following nearly a week  of  opposition  demonstrations
        against the election results,  Khamenei  issued  his  first  public
        response to the unrest: before a  crowd  of  supporters  at  Friday
        prayers, he again  backed  Ahmadinejad's  victory  and  warned  the
        opposition against  further  demonstrations.   Subsequent  protests
        were greeted with  increasing  brutality  as  well  as  threats  of
        further confrontation, and at a protest in Tehr?n Mousavi announced
        that he himself was prepared for martyrdom.
    26.  On  June  22  the  Council  of   Guardians   confirmed   that   50
        constituencies had returned more votes than there  were  registered
        voters (the opposition alleged that as many  as  some  three  times
        that number of  constituencies  had  a  turnout  greater  than  100
        percent of eligible voters). Although the irregularities  bore  the
        potential to affect  some  three  million  votes,  the  Council  of
        Guardians indicated that this would not change the outcome  of  the
        election itself. Following the completion of its  partial  recount,
        the council confirmed Ahmadinejad's victory  and  in  early  August
        Ahmadinejad was sworn in for his second term as president.
    27. It is not disputed the attitude of the Iranian authorities  towards
        those they consider a threat to their power can  result  in  brutal
        reprisals and the arrest of those who  openly  demonstrate  against
        them as the appellant feared, but there is not  in  the  appellants
        evidence any country information  indicating  that  those  who  did
        protest in 2009/10 are still of interest to the authorities some 10
        years later.
    28. It is also the case that even if a person's existing refugee status
        ceases as a result of the  application  of  Article  1C,  they  can
        always reapply for such status if they have evidence that  supports
        such an application and a finding they will face  a  real  risk  of
        persecution at that time.
    29. Article 11 of the Qualification Directive, which replicates Article
        1C of the Refugee Convention, reads:

        'Article 11


        Cessation


        1.   A third country national or a stateless person shall cease  to
        be a refugee, if he or she:


           (a)  has  voluntarily  re-availed  himself  or  herself  of  the
        protection of the country of nationality; or


           (b) having lost his or  her  nationality,  has  voluntarily  re-
        acquired it; or


           (c) has acquired a new nationality, and enjoys the protection of
        the country of his or her new nationality; or


           (d) has voluntarily re-established himself  or  herself  in  the
        country which he or she left or outside which he  or  she  remained
        owing to fear of persecution; or


           (e) can no longer, because the circumstances in connection  with
        which he or she has been recognised as a  refugee  have  ceased  to
        exist, continue to refuse  to  avail  himself  or  herself  of  the
        protection of the country of nationality;


           (f) being a stateless person with no nationality, he or  she  is
        able, because the circumstances in connection with which he or  she
        has been recognised as a refugee have ceased to exist, to return to
        the country of former habitual residence.


        2.   In considering points (e) and  (f)  of  paragraph 1,  Member
        States shall have regard to whether the change of circumstances  is
        of such a significant and non-temporary nature that  the  refugee's
        fear of persecution can no longer be regarded as well-founded.'

    30. The first point to note, therefore, is that  subparagraphs  (a)  to
        (f) are alternatives. For example, a  person  can  cease  to  be  a
        refugee  if  they  have  voluntary  re-availed  themselves  of  the
        protection of the country of nationality, even if the  requirements
        of Article 11 (1) (e) have not been shown  to  exist.  This  is  an
        Article 11(1)(a) QD appeal.
    31. It is also important to bear in mind that Article 1C of the Refugee
        Convention and Article 11 of the Qualification  Directive  set  out
        the circumstances in which the Refugee  Convention  will  cease  to
        apply because an individual no longer needs protection.
    32. Although the appellant relies upon the decision  of  the  Court  of
        Appeal in MS (Somalia) it is important to record that in that  case
        it was found that refugee status can be taken away even  if  threat
        of persecution still looms. It is also  material  to  the  findings
        relied upon by the appellant to note that in MS (Somalia) the issue
        was the application of Article 11(e) and  not  Article  11(a),  the
        provision applicable in this appeal.
    33. It is not made out the Judge was required to read the provisions of
        Article 1C  of  the  Refugee  Convention  and  Article  11  of  the
        Qualification Directive as being that the Secretary of State  could
        only  lawfully  cease  the  appellant's  refugee  status   if   the
        requirements of both Article 11 (a) and (e) were met  cumulatively.
        This will be contrary to the  specific  wording  of  the  provision
        making them alternatives.
    34. The argument advanced by the appellant that he will  always  be  at
        risk of persecution until there is a change of the regime  in  Iran
        is too generalised a statement. If the reference to  regime  change
        is to the structure of government in Iran  this  arguably  prevents
        reconsideration if the attitudes of  the  existing  regime  change.
        This is, however, more applicable to Article 11(e).
    35. There is reference in the appellant's  skeleton  argument  that  he
        returned to Iran "na�vely" but such a claim is not made out on  the
        facts. The history, as found by the Judge, was that  the  appellant
        embarked upon a deliberate course  of  conduct,  starting  with  an
        application to the Iranian authorities in the  United  Kingdom  for
        the issue/reissue of a valid Iranian passport. The Judge's  finding
        that the details on that passport are those of  the  appellant  and
        not incorrect or false details is a finding  within  the  range  of
        those available to the Judge on the evidence and no arguable  legal
        error arises. The appellant then uses that passport  to  travel  to
        Iran, the country that he claims he is outside of  due  to  a  real
        risk  persecution  for  a  Convention  Reason.  Not  only  did  the
        appellant apply for the first passport he also applied for a second
        passport and use those valid passports  to  travel  to  Iran  on  a
        number of occasions; eight over a period of three years as found by
        the Judge. It appears the appellant  travelled  openly  through  an
        international airport, within Iran using his identity  document  on
        which he returned without difficulty.  The  appellant  had  claimed
        international protection and been granted the same on the basis  of
        the real risk he claimed to face at that time and would  have  been
        fully aware more recently of information in the public domain, such
        as on the BBC, of developments in Iran and a risk to those who  are
        perceived to pose a threat to the authorities. It was not made  out
        that he was na�ve as to any risk that a person who had  an  adverse
        profile would face in returning to Iran or even engaging  with  the
        Consular staff to whom he would have been required to  provide  the
        information required on the passport application forms.
    36. Although it was suggested before the Upper  Tribunal  that  greater
        attention may be given to returnees from the UK rather  than  those
        via third country airport, as was the position for  the  appellant,
        it was not made out the authorities would not have been able  aware
        the passport had been issued in the United Kingdom.  Despite  this,
        there is no indication in the evidence or claim  by  the  appellant
        that he faced any difficulties in entering Iran, remaining in Iran,
        or exiting using his validly issued identity documents. By applying
        for and obtaining the passports in the United Kingdom the appellant
        would have had to have dealings with the diplomatic representatives
        of Iran.
    37. The appellant cannot argue that despite being a genuine refugee  he
        did not possess the same fear of the consular of authorities in the
        UK as he may have had towards officials in Iran, as he clearly  use
        the documents he had obtained to facilitate  entry  to  and  return
        from Iran. It is clear that the appellant's conduct was  deliberate
        and aimed at enabling him  to  engage  with  the  Iranian  Consular
        authorities, to enter Iran, remain in Iran at the family  home  for
        some time, and engage with the authorities including religious  and
        civil in marrying on two occasions and divorcing on one. It was not
        made out before the Judge that the appellant believed  he  faced  a
        credible real risk in engaging with the authorities.
    38. The Judge's finding that the appellant's claim he had to return for
        involuntary reasons as a result  of  the  serious  illness  of  his
        parents, particularly his mother,  was  found  to  lack  merit,  is
        properly reasoned. It was not made out before the Judge  that  this
        was a necessary  or  involuntary  return.  The  Appellant  returned
        voluntarily with the intention of engaging with the authorities  as
        he did.
    39. Similarly, the appellant's claim he did this as a result of being a
        "risktakers" was rejected by the Judge for which  adequate  reasons
        have been given.
    40. The Judge found that the Secretary of State established objectively
        that the appellant intends to avail himself of  the  protection  of
        Iran on the facts.  That created a rebuttable presumption  enabling
        the appellant to adduce other evidence  to  try  and  persuade  the
        Judge in the alternative.
    41. After numerous visits, lengthy stays, coming into contact with  the
        authorities  in  obtaining  the  passport,  getting   married   and
        registering the marriage officially, the rejection of the claim  to
        have travelled out of necessity as a result of his mothers  illness
        and/ or the appellants reckless conduct, the Judge did  not  accept
        the appellant's arguments. It has not been made out the Judge erred
        in law in drawing the line in relation to the question of voluntary
        re-availment where she did.
    42. The Judge examined the evidence and found that  the  appellant  had
        effectively,  genuinely  and  voluntarily  re-availed  him  of  the
        protection of his country of origin. The Judge does not  find  that
        merely renewing the passport, without more,  established  that  the
        appellant intended to re-avail him of the protection of his country
        of origin as to do so would have given rise to legal error. This is
        also not a case in which the appellant as a refugee only  undertook
        a short trip to Iran. It is the Judges  holistic  assessment  based
        upon the evidence that the appellant voluntary re-engaged with  the
        Iranian Consular authorities in the  UK  to  obtain  his  passport,
        undertook  frequent  and  lengthy  visits   without   evidence   of
        experiencing   difficulties   with   the   authorities   in   Iran,
        facilitating the numerous trips to the appellant made, engaged with
        the  authorities  through  marriage  and  divorce,  and  failed  to
        establish he was unable to do other than live a  normal  open  life
        with his family whilst in Iran.
    43. I find the appellant has failed to establish that  the  finding  of
        the Judge that he had re-availed himself of the protection of  Iran
        on the facts is a finding outside the  range  of  those  reasonably
        available to the Judge on the evidence.  Accordingly,  the  Judge's
        finding dismissing the appeal  against  the  Secretary  of  State's
        decision to cease the appellant's refugee status has not been shown
        to be infected by material legal error on the facts of this appeal.
        It is  not,  therefore,  appropriate  for  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
        interfere any further in this matter.

Decision

    44. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  Immigration  Judge's
        decision. The determination shall stand.

   Anonymity.

    45. The First-tier Tribunal made no order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i)  of
        the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.

        I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
