Representation:

For the Appellant:                  Mr G Harrison, Specialist Appeals Team
For the Respondents/Claimants:  Professor Rees, Counsel

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The Secretary of State appeals to the Upper Tribunal from the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal allowing the first claimant's appeal against
    the decision by the respondent to refuse to grant her leave  to  remain
    in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant.   The  First-
    tier Tribunal made an anonymity order because the  third  claimant  and
    another child of  the  first  claimant  are  minors.   However,  having
    exercised my own independent judgment on the matter, I do not  consider
    that the children affected by the  immigration  decision  under  appeal
    require anonymity for these proceedings in the  Upper  Tribunal,  given
    the nature of the issues that are in controversy before me.

 2. The first claimant is married to the second claimant, and they have two
    children.  Their eldest child Imaan is the third claimant.  The  second
    and third claimants joined in the first claimant's appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal as PBS dependants. They were refused leave to  remain  in
    line with the refusal of the first  claimant's  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
    application.  As the first claimant  is  the  main  claimant,  I  shall
    hereafter refer to her simply as the claimant, save where  the  context
    otherwise requires.

 3. The claimant first entered the UK on 30 March  2005  with  valid  entry
    clearance as a student.  She has  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom  ever
    since.  Her husband entered the United Kingdom on 13 February  2008  as
    her dependent spouse.  Their daughter Imaan was born in the  UK  on  30
    October 2008, and their second child was born in the United Kingdom  on
    9 May 2012.

 4. The claimant's last grant of leave to remain as a student expired on 15
    October 2012.  On 14 September 2012 she made her Tier 1  (Entrepreneur)
    application.  She was part of an entrepreneurial team.  The other  team
    member was Naveed Aslam,  a  Pakistani  national  like  her.   She  was
    relying on access to funds of not less than �200,000.  The  funds  were
    held in Silk Bank of Pakistan,  and  amounted  to  just  over  �237,000
    sterling equivalent.   None  of  the  funds  had  been  invested.   The
    application was accompanied by a letter from the branch  manager,  Silk
    Bank Ltd in Islamabad.  The letter was dated 16 August 2012.  The  bank
    certified that the following account was being maintained at Silk  Bank
    Ltd E - 11 branch, namely an account held by Mimoona Zainub Kazmi.  The
    account had  been  maintained  since  15  August  2012,  and  the  bank
    confirmed that the balance  in  the  account  on  that  date  stood  at
    Rs35,617,625 and 4 paisas only. The letter continued: "this certificate
    has been issued at the specific request of  the  customer  without  any
    liability on behalf of the bank and bank officers." The writer went  on
    to say that Silk Bank Ltd was regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan.

 5. On 11 March 2013 Beverley Brate of the temporary migration  team  wrote
    to the appellant's solicitors.  She asked them to note  that  UKBA  had
    identified "two minor omissions" with regards to the evidence that  had
    been submitted.  The bank letter that had been supplied had omitted  to
    show both of the applicant's names, who formed an entrepreneurial team.
     In addition, the third party contact details were missing.

 6. The appellant's solicitors responded on 18 March 2013.  They  commented
    that Miss Brate's letter suggested that the other  two  documents  (the
    third party letter and the legal representative's letter) were  in  the
    right format.  Their understanding was that she only required the  bank
    letter to be supplied with a current date.  They asked  Miss  Brate  to
    clarify whether they wanted them to provide her with  the  bank  letter
    only, or whether further documentary evidence was required.

 7. Miss Brate responded on 27 March 2013.  The letter from Silk Bank dated
    16 August 2012  was  not  acceptable  as  it  contained  the  following
    omissions;

      1) It should name both applicants.

      2) It should confirm that the required funds are being made  available
         by the third party to both applicants.

      3) The third party contact details should  also  be  included  in  the
         letter.

 8. Miss Brate said that the above evidence should be supplied  within  ten
    working days.

 9. The solicitors responded  on  18  April  2013  saying  they  had  taken
    instruction from their clients, who had  contacted  their  sponsor  Mrs
    Kazmi who had in turn approached Silk Bank in Islamabad.  Unfortunately
    the manager confirmed they had a set  template  which  they  would  not
    depart from in any circumstances, and this would be  in  line  with  UK
    bank policy as well.  They questioned whether it was a requirement that
    the names of the applicants needed to be stipulated in the bank letter.
     Furthermore they referred to an affidavit of Mrs Kazmi  in  which  she
    said she was prepared to make available the required funds for both the
    applicants, whom she named, and in which she described her relationship
    with the applicants as that  of  a  first  cousin.   Finally,  she  had
    provided a full address and telephone number in order that  UKBA  could
    verify the information with her.

10. On 2 May 2013 the Secretary of State gave her reasons for refusing  the
    application.  Paragraph 41-SD(a)(i) 6, 9 and 10 of Appendix  A  of  the
    Rules stated that a letter from a financial institution  holding  funds
    which were available to the applicant, must state the applicant's  name
    (and team member's name where appropriate), confirm the amount of money
    provided to the applicant from the third party, and confirm the contact
    details of the third party,  including  their  full  address  including
    postal code, landline number and any email address.  On 18  April  2013
    Ali Sinclair Solicitors replied by letter  that  they  were  unable  to
    provide a letter from Silk Bank containing  the  required  information.
    In line with Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, the Home  Office  has
    therefore been unable to award  any  points  for  access  to  funds  as
    required.

11. It had therefore been decided to refuse her application  for  leave  to
    remain under paragraph 245DD of the Rules, as  she  did  not  meet  the
    requirement of paragraph 245DD(b).  In line with paragraph 245DD(l)  of
    the Rules, they had not  carried  out  an  assessment  as  detailed  in
    paragraph 245DD(h) of the Rules as her application  had  been  refused.
    But they reserved the right  to  carry  out  this  assessment  and  any
    challenge to  the  decision  or  in  future  applications  for  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) status.

The Hearing Before, the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

12. The claimants' appeals came before Judge Stokes sitting in  the  First-
    tier Tribunal at Taylor House on  15  April  2014.   Mr  Carroll,  Home
    Office Presenting Officer, appeared on behalf of the Secretary of State
    and Professor Rees, Counsel,  instructed  by  Ali  Sinclair  Solicitors
    appeared on behalf of the claimants.  The judge received oral  evidence
    from the claimant, who adopted her witness statement of 31  March  2014
    as her evidence-in-chief, and who was not cross-examined.

13. The judge's findings on the question of whether the claimant  qualified
    for leave to remain under the Rules are set out at paragraphs 24 to  33
    of his subsequent determination.

14. At paragraph 27, he accepted Mr  Carroll's  submission  that  the  Home
    Office  had  complied  with  its  evidential  flexibility   policy   by
    requesting the details missing from the bank's letter.  At 28, he  said
    it was not in dispute the  letter  from  the  bank  produced  with  the
    application did not meet the specific requirements of  paragraph  41-SD
    of Appendix A.

15. At paragraph 29 he found that the bank  refused  to  provide  a  letter
    which would be in accordance with the requirements of the Rules because
    of  Pakistani  banking  Regulations.   He  accepted   Professor   Rees'
    submission that, if the bank's letter and Miss Kazmi's  affidavit  were
    read together, they contained all the details specified under paragraph
    41-SD(d)(i) of the Rules.

16. At paragraph 30, he held that the documents  before  the  Secretary  of
    State contained the information required by the Rules, "albeit not in a
    specified format".  The judge went on to find  that  the  Secretary  of
    State had not given due appreciation to the discretionary power set out
    in paragraph 245AA(b)(iv) of the Immigration Rules. Thus the  Secretary
    of State's decision in refusing the application under the Rules was not
    in accordance with the law and she should have exercised her discretion
    differently.

17. In the light of that finding, he found that the claimant  was  eligible
    to be awarded 25 points for access to funds, and also  eligible  to  be
    awarded 25 points for funds held in a regulated financial  institution,
    and funds disposable in the UK,  and  her  appeal  succeeded,  and  the
    appeals of the second and third claimants succeeded in line  with  her,
    as they were her dependants.

18. The judge  went  on  to  make  findings  under  Article  8  ECHR.   The
    background to this was that the removal directions under Section 47  of
    the 2006 Act had been withdrawn by Mr Carroll  at  the  outset  of  the
    hearing.   But  the  judge  was  nonetheless  asked  to  consider   the
    claimant's rights under Article 8  ECHR  "should  removal  be  directed
    again".  The judge rejected Professor Rees' submission that  the  first
    claimant met the requirements of paragraph  276ADE(vi)  of  the  Rules.
    After a discussion of the children's best interests in paragraph 42, he
    concluded at paragraph 43 that the decision to  refuse  the  claimant's
    application for further leave to remain in the  UK  outside  the  Rules
    would be proportionate, and would not cause the UK to be in  breach  of
    its obligations under Article 8.

The Application for Permission to Appeal

19. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal,  arguing  that
    the judge materially erred in law in  allowing  the  appeal  under  the
    Rules, when it was accepted by the claimant that  the  Rules  were  not
    satisfied.  With regard to evidential flexibility, the judge  had  made
    conflicting  findings.   Moreover,  at  the  relevant  date   paragraph
    245AA(b)(iv) did not exist.  Furthermore, the judge had not  identified
    how the claimant  could  fall  within  its  parameters.   The  document
    provided was neither in the wrong format, nor  was  it  a  copy  of  an
    original.  The deficiency was missing specified information.

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

20. On 24 June 2014 Judge Pooler  granted  permission  to  appeal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "It is arguable that the judge, who recorded the agreed fact that a
         letter from a bank did not meet the requirements of paragraph 41-SD
         of Appendix A of the Immigration Rules, erred in  law  in  allowing
         the appeal by reference to the Rules."

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

21. At the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, Professor Rees robustly  defended
    the judge's decision, for the reasons set out in his skeleton argument.
     He confirmed that sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph 245AA had not been in
    existence at the date of the decision, but  had  only  been  introduced
    into the Rules on 21 October 2013.   But  he  submitted  this  did  not
    matter,  as  the  provision  was  merely   codifying   a   pre-existing
    discretion.

22. He submitted that no distinction  could  reasonably  be  drawn  between
    missing information and presenting information in a wrong  format.   He
    submitted that "format" surely included the presentation of information
    or  lack  of  it.   Professor  Rees  reported  that  recent   published
    statistics show that  90%  of  Tier  1  applicants  had  their  Tier  1
    applications rejected.  He said that the problems for Tier 1 applicants
    had become  more  acute  since  the  decision  in  Rodriguez  had  been
    overturned by the Court of Appeal.  He submitted that the  decision  of
    the Secretary of State in this instance  did  not  accord  with  common
    sense.  It was beyond the claimant's control that the bank in  Pakistan
    refused to issue a bank letter which met the requirements of the Rules.
     It was open to the judge not only to find that  the  discretion  under
    paragraph 245AA(d) had not been exercised properly by the Secretary  of
    State, but to find that the discretion should have  been  exercised  in
    the appellant's favour, and thus to go on to allow the appeal outright.



23. In reply, Mr Harrison  submitted  that  there  was  nothing  inherently
    unreasonable in requiring the letter from the foreign bank  to  provide
    all the information specified in paragraph 41-SD.  If the provision  of
    all the specified information was contrary  to  the  Regulations  which
    govern the bank, the solution for the  claimant  was  to  find  another
    bank, or to arrange for the funds  to  be  transferred  to  the  United
    Kingdom.

24. The claimant interjected to say that she had  raised  this  possibility
    with her solicitors, but she had been told that she could not do  this.
    Mr Harrison submitted that the advice she had been given  was  correct,
    insofar as it related to an existing application.  In order to rely  on
    access to funds in a different bank account, she would have  needed  to
    make a fresh application.

25. After receiving further submissions from  Professor  Rees,  I  gave  my
    error  of  law  ruling.   I  held  that  the  Secretary  of  State  had
    established that the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  under  the
    Rules was vitiated by a material error of law, such that it  should  be
    set aside and remade.  My reasons for so finding are set out below.

Reasons of Finding an Error of Law

26. As stated by Judge Pooler when granting permission to appeal, it was an
    agreed  fact  that  the  bank  letter  relied  on  in  support  of  the
    application did not meet the requirements of paragraph 41-SD.   It  did
    not state the applicant's name and her team partner's name.  It did not
    confirm the amount of money provided to  the  applicant  and  her  team
    partner from the third party, and it did not confirm the  name  of  the
    third party funder and the third party funder's  contact  details.   It
    had also not confirmed that the money could be transferred into the  UK
    (albeit this is not a point taken in the refusal letter).  On the  face
    of it, the bank letter did no more than confirm that the named  account
    holder, who had only opened her  account  on  15  August  2012,  had  a
    specified sum in her new account at the close of business  on  the  day
    she opened her account.

27. As the bank letter  did  not  contain  all  the  mandatory  information
    specified in paragraph 41-SD, the claimant had plainly failed to comply
    with the Rules, and her  appeal  could  not  succeed,  subject  to  two
    arguments raised on her behalf.

28. It is convenient to deal first  with  Professor  Rees'  argument  that,
    because the missing information was  obtainable  from  other  specified
    documents, the omissions were not material and it was open to the judge
    to allow the appeal under the Rules outright.

29. Under the points-based system, the Secretary of State does not have  to
    demonstrate materiality.  The Secretary of State can insist  on  strict
    compliance with each and every provision in paragraph 41-SD, and is not
    open to  the  judicial  decision  maker  to  waive  compliance  with  a
    particular set of requirements  because  he  regards  the  claimant  as
    having a good excuse for non-compliance.

30. Secondly, although the omissions in the  bank  letter  were  originally
    characterised by UKBA as being minor omissions, on analysis  they  were
    highly significant. This explains  the  progressive  hardening  of  the
    stance taken by the Home Office, culminating in refusal.

31. One of the features of the points-based system is that  frequently  the
    onus is placed on a third party  to  provide  verification.   The  bank
    letter requirement fits this model, in that the bank relied on  by  the
    applicant is required to provide confirmation of a number of pieces  of
    information.  The missing information in  the  bank  letter  is  highly
    significant  as  the  effect  is  that  the  bank  does   not   provide
    confirmation of the proposed arrangement.  The bank  does  not  confirm
    that the money in the  account  is  available  for  investment  by  the
    claimant and her entrepreneurial team member in the United Kingdom.

32. It is thus no answer to say that the third party herself  has  provided
    an affidavit certifying that the money in her account is  available  to
    the claimant and her entrepreneurial team member, nor that the claimant
    has provided a  letter  from  a  legal  representative  confirming  the
    validity of the signatures on each third  party  declaration  provided.
    For under paragraph 41-SD the claimant was  required  to  provide  such
    specified documents in any event.  What was missing was the vital third
    component, which was the bank's confirmation, from its  own  knowledge,
    that the claimant had access to  the  entirety  of  the  funds  in  the
    relevant bank account.

33. I turn to the question of evidential flexibility.  There is an historic
    timeline constraint in paragraph 41-SD with regard  to  an  applicant's
    reliance on a bank letter.  One of the requirements specified  is  that
    the bank letter must  have  been  produced  "within  the  three  months
    immediately before the date of your application".  When the Home Office
    came to assess the claimant's application, it  was  apparent  that  the
    bank letter did not meet all the relevant requirements.   In  light  of
    the historic timeline constraint, the  claimant  could  not  cure  this
    defect by obtaining a new bank letter in the context  of  the  existing
    application.  A new bank letter would have to be produced in support of
    a new application.   Against  this  background,  the  Home  Office  was
    displaying some indulgence to the claimant in giving her an opportunity
    to deal with the deficiencies in the bank letter in the context of  her
    current application.  The claimant was not able to  take  advantage  of
    the opportunity that was afforded to her, because of the position taken
    by the bank in Pakistan.  That was not the fault of  the  Home  Office,
    and so on the face of it the claimant has no  cause  for  complaint  on
    evidential flexibility grounds.

34. Judge Stokes appears to have recognised  this,  but  nonetheless  found
    that there had been a breach of evidential flexibility principles.  The
    judge's reasoning in so finding was fundamentally flawed.

35. Although sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph 245AA had not  been  introduced
    into the Rules at the date of decision, I am prepared  to  accept  that
    this merely codifies a discretion which the Secretary of State  already
    had at the date of decision.

36. The relevant gateway requirement for the exercise of the discretion  is
    that the specified document is in the wrong format.  The  problem  with
    the bank letter relied on is not its layout, but the fact that it omits
    mandatory pieces of information.  As stated previously, it is no answer
    to say that the information can be obtained from  the  other  specified
    documents, for the essential ingredient is the bank's  confirmation  of
    the information in question.

37. Accordingly, for the reasons given above, the judge  erred  in  law  in
    allowing the claimants' appeal against refusal to vary their  leave  to
    remain under the Rules and/or on the basis that the refusal was not  in
    accordance with the law.

The Remaking of the Decision

38. For the reasons given in my error of law ruling, there can only be  one
    outcome to the claimants' appeals against the  decision  to  refuse  to
    vary their leave to remain, and that is that their  appeals  should  be
    dismissed.  The decisions appealed against were in accordance with  the
    Rules and were otherwise in accordance with the law.

39. The judge's Article 8 findings were made in the context of  a  possible
    future removal  decision,  but  they  are  equally  applicable  to  the
    proposed interference  consequential  upon  the  refusal  of  leave  to
    remain.

40. There is no cross-appeal against the judge's Article 8 findings, and in
    any event the claimants are  not  necessarily  required  to  leave  the
    country.  It is open to the first claimant to make a fresh  application
    within 28 days of her appeal rights being deemed to be exhausted.   She
    can demonstrate access to funds by having the funds transferred into  a
    bank account  in  the  UK  which  is  in  her  name  and  that  of  her
    entrepreneurial team member.

Decision

41. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not contain an error of law
    in dismissing the claimants' appeals under Article 8 of the  ECHR,  and
    that part of the decision stands.

42. But the First-tier Tribunal's decision allowing the claimant's  appeals
    against the decision to refuse to vary their leave contained  an  error
    of law, and accordingly the  following  decision  is  substituted:  the
    claimant's appeals against the decision by the respondent to refuse  to
    vary their leave to remain are dismissed under the Rules.
