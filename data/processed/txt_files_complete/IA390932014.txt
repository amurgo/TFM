Representation:
Appellant   In person
Respondent  Mr Diwnycz (Home Office Presenting Officer)

                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan. The  appellant  entered  the
       United Kingdom as a visitor on in 2009 and was given leave to remain
       here as a visitor until 2010. He applied for leave to remain as a  a
       family member but this was refused on June 1, 2012. On July 25, 2014
       he sought a residence card based on a durable relationship with  his
       partner, an EEA national. The respondent refused his application  on
       October 6, 2014. The appellant appealed that decision under  section
       82(1) of the  Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  and
       Regulation  26  of  the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
       Regulations 2006.

    2. The appeal came before Designated Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal
       Garrett on February 23, 2015 and in a decision promulgated on  April
       20, 2015 he refused the appellant's appeal finding firstly,  he  was
       not in a durable relationship and  secondly,  his  partner  had  not
       satisfactory demonstrated she  was  was  a  qualified  person  under
       Regulation 4 of the 2006 Regulations.

    3. The appellant lodged grounds of appeal on May 5, 2015 submitting the
       First-tier Judge had erred.

    4.  Designated  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal   MacDonald   gave
       permission to appeal on basis the Judge may have erred in respect of
       his recording of the appellant's partner's evidence in  relation  to
       her income and that if the Judge had then this error played a  major
       part in his assessment of the durable relationship.

    5. In a Rule 24 letter dated June 28, 2015 the respondent  opposed  the
       appeal. She argued there was no evidence to support the  appellant's
       claim the Judge had erred in his recording of the evidence.

    6. The matter came before me on the above date and I heard  submissions
       from both Mr Diwnycz and the appellant.

    7. The First-tier Tribunal did not  make  an  anonymity  direction  and
       pursuant to Rule 14 of The Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
       2008 I make no order.

SUBMISSIONS

    8. Mr Ahmed argued his partner had provided documents  to  support  her
       evidence and that if she had said she earned  �50-60  per  week  she
       clearly meant per day because those figures would not  have  matched
       her reported income given to HMRC. He submitted she was working  and
       there were nothing in the regulations that stated how much had to be
       earned. He stated they were struggling to survive on  his  partner's
       income because he was not allowed to work. He argued the  Judge  had
       erred.

    9. Mr Diwnycz relied on the rule 24 response and  submitted  the  Judge
       had  correctly  recorded  the  appellant's  partner's  evidence   as
       evidenced  by  both   the   court   record   and   his   colleague's
       contemporaneous note. The Judge had  assessed  the  quality  of  the
       evidence and based on the evidence found inconsistencies  and  these
       inconsistencies fed into his assessment of their relationship.


DISCUSSION AND FINDINGS

   10. The appellant had been represented until recently and the grounds of
       appeal  had  been  prepared  by  his  representatives.   In   giving
       permission the Judge noted that the appellant's appeal was based  on
       the fact his partner claimed she had stated she said she earned �50-
       60 "per day" and not "per week" as recorded by the Judge. It is this
       error that it was submitted infected the remainder of the decision.

   11. I have checked the record of  proceedings  (copy  was  sent  to  the
       appellant's representatives  last  year)  and  I  also  checked  the
       respondent's record of the evidence. The appellant's  representative
       did not submit her record. The available records  both  confirm  the
       appellant's partner stated she was asked how much  she  earned  each
       week and her reply was �50-60 per week.

   12. The Judge's record is accurate and as I explained to the appellant I
       had to then consider the decision based on the fact the evidence was
       accurately recorded. In paragraph [19] of his decision the Judge set
       out in some detail  the  inconsistencies  that  followed  from  that
       evidence. The  records  showed  one  income  but  the  witness  gave
       evidence that was significantly different from those records.  There
       was a lack of bank statements to support her income and the accounts
       were unaudited and based on what the firm were told. The  Judge  had
       regard to financial problems that existed and  ultimately  concluded
       he was not satisfied she earned what was being claimed.

   13. The Regulations do not state how much a person must earn but to be a
       qualifying person the appellant had to demonstrate his wife was self-
       employed within the  definition  of  Regulation  4(b)  of  the  2006
       Regulations.

   14. The appellant suggested that he should have been told what should be
       lodged but  I  explained  to  him  that  was  not  the  Tribunal  or
       respondent's role especially where he was represented.

   15. The Judge's decision could be viewed as harsh but being  harsh  does
       not  mean  there  is  an  error  of  law.  There  were   unexplained
       inconsistencies and I conclude it was open  to  the  Judge  to  find
       Regulation 4(b) was not met. The appeal to me  must  fail  for  this
       reason alone.

   16. The adverse finding fed into his finding  on  durable  relationship.
       The Judge was aware of all the evidence but for the reasons given in
       paragraphs [19] to [22] he concluded the  appellant  had  failed  to
       show there was a durable relationship.

   17. Both findings were open to the  Judge  and  in  those  circumstances
       there is no error.


DECISION

   18. The making of the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
       involve the making of an error on a point of law. I uphold the First-
       tier decision.
