                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent
Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms S Kansal, Counsel instructed by Nasim & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr S Walker, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and his  date  of  birth  is  12
    November 1984.

2.   The appellant made an application for leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrant under the  points-based  system  on  21  October
    2013.  The Secretary of State refused the application on 6 March  2014.
    The Secretary of State concluded that it  was  not  credible  that  the
    appellant had �50,000 in order to invest.  It  was  conceded  that  his
    personal bank statement showed that he had the requisite funds, but not
    that the funds were from the appellant's savings as he  stated  in  his
    interview in the light of the appellant's income.  The  decision  maker
    referred to another application in the same category from  Mr  Muhammad
    Mubbshar of the same address as the appellant.  With his application he
    submitted a letter from the appellant  stating  that  he  would  invest
    �50,000 into Mr Mubbshar's business.

3.   The Secretary of State did not accept the viability of the  appellant's
    business plan because it was heavily based on business plans found on a
    general website.  It  was  noted  that  the  appellant  stated  in  his
    interview that he had his own website, but it has the same wording  and
    design of the website of another named book-keeping company.

4.   The Secretary of State concluded that the appellant had no  clear  idea
    of how the business will operate and in relation to market research his
    answers were poor and lacking in detail.  In addition it was  concluded
    that the appellant has a lack of skills.

5.   The appellant appealed against the decision of the Secretary  of  State
    and his appeal was dismissed by Judge of the First-tier Tribunal  Perry
    in a decision that was promulgated on 1 August 2014 following a hearing
    on 25 July 2014.  Permission was granted by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal P J G White on 20 October 2014.  Thus the matter  came  before
    me.

The Findings of the FtT

6.   The findings  of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Perry  read  as
    follows:-

         32.  Paragraph 245DD sets down the factors that the respondent  may
             take into account in assessing the appellant's application for
             leave to remain as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur).  A relevant factor
             is the viability and credibility of the money referred  to  in
             Table 4 of Appendix A.  The respondent was not satisfied  that
             the money was genuinely available to the appellant until  such
             time as the money is spent in the business.  In his  interview
             the appellant said that he owns �50,000.  Reference  was  made
             at  the  hearing  to  �205,000.   The  appellant   was   asked
             questions, not unreasonably, about the source  of  the  funds.
             He  said  that  the  mother  transferred   the   money.    The
             distribution to him was part of the joint family system.   The
             family business was based on sales of clothes into the  German
             market.


         33.  However the absence of concrete information is apparent.   The
             appellant needs to satisfy the respondent as to the source  of
             his funds as stated above in this paragraph but  there  is  no
             information about the family business or where it  is  located
             or evidence of ownership or evidence of distribution of funds.
              There is a reference to funds being sent by  the  mother  but
             again no evidence to specify the mother's legal involvement in
             the handling of  the  funds  or  her  entitlement  to  make  a
             distribution or evidence of the terms on which the  sums  were
             credited to the appellant's account.  There is no account from
             the appellant or his family or the family's advisers about the
             "joint family system" - how it is structured and how there  is
             a  link  between  the  funds  and  the  distribution  to   the
             appellant.


         34.  In his bundle of  documents  submitted  for  the  hearing  the
             appellant has provided supporting material.   He  relies  upon
             two letters from  Bank  Al  Habib.   The  first  is  dated  18
             September 2013.  It states that the appellant  has  a  sum  of
             rupees - 33,008,456 - in cash deposit, equivalent according to
             the currency converter approached by the appellant or his bank
             to �194,235.  There is no information as to how the  sum  came
             into the appellant's possession - the source of funds  is  not
             revealed.  The Bank in the same letter states that  the  funds
             "are freely transferable and disposable in the UK".  This  may
             well be the case but in the absence of information  about  the
             source of such funds they do  not  provide  comfort  that  the
             funds are genuinely available to the appellant.  There  is  no
             evidence that the appellant  has  saved  such  sums  but  more
             importantly having regard to his reference to his  mother  and
             the family system and joint  family  unit  the  appellant  has
             failed to provide any documentary  evidence  to  show  a  link
             between these matters and the funds  in  his  account.   Other
             than the two letters - which are almost identical in wording -
             and  bank  statements  of  the  bank  recording  entries   the
             appellant has produced no other information  that  inform  how
             the appellant has come into ownership of such monies.  I  find
             that the appellant has failed to  prove  that  the  funds  are
             genuinely available to him.


         35.  The circumstances of the appellant's loan  of  �50,000  to  Mr
             Mubbshar raise further  doubts  about  the  intention  of  the
             appellant to invest the money referred to  in  Table  4.   The
             respondent was not satisfied that the  �50,000  of  investment
             funds were genuinely available.  The letter from Farani-Javid-
             Taylor says that the appellant has made �50,000  available  to
             Mr  Mubbshar  to  invest  in  the  latter's   business.    The
             respondent concluded that the appellant did not have the funds
             available to invest in Unique Accountants  Ltd.   In  evidence
             the appellant said that the advance was a loan but  there  was
             no evidence  of  the  loan  agreement.   The  loan,  said  the
             appellant,  was  a  "formal  arrangement"  but  there  was  no
             evidence of the "arrangement".  He said that he had "the value
             of property in my own name" but produced no  evidence  of  the
             same.  He said he had earned �15,000 in interest but  did  not
             identify the receipt of  the  interest  monies.   He  said  he
             invested the interest earned "overseas" but again produced  no
             documents to show any such overseas  earnings.   Taking  these
             matters together I find that the �50,000 of  investment  funds
             are not genuinely  available  or  that  such  funds  meet  the
             requirements of the Tier 1 Entrepreneur application.


         36.  The  appellant  has  submitted  a  business  plan  for  Unique
             Accountants Ltd.   There  are  justifiable  doubts  about  the
             originality of the appellant's business plan.   The  appellant
             has  not  disputed  that  the   website   in   the   name   of
             www.uniqueaccountants.org is  exactly  the  same  wording  and
             design as the website of Hansen Linburg who are a  bookkeeping
             company based in  Romford.   Such  plagiarism  undermines  the
             credibility of the appellant's  claim  to  have  in  place  an
             independent and  considered  business  plan.   The  respondent
             correctly drew attention to the market research the  appellant
             says he undertaken.  There  are  two  significant  weaknesses;
             first the appellant fails  to  make  a  case  to  support  his
             contention that he will be able to compete  successfully  with
             the 150 competitor businesses that he has identified.   Second
             the appellant said in evidence that he had just one  client  -
             KWA Trading for whom he does bookkeeping work.  The  appellant
             said that he faced an ethical  dilemma  which  restricted  his
             number of clients.  He said he was not able  to  approach  new
             clients until his long term situation  was  resolved  but  the
             appellants work was in providing routine tax calculations  and
             bookkeeping work.  There was no evidence  that  the  appellant
             was offered a number of long term assignments that  came  into
             conflict with the unresolved visa  issues  which  justified  a
             decision not to proceed.  Having regard to the  plagiarism  of
             his business plan and the unsatisfactory explanation  for  the
             lack of progress in developing his business I  find  that  the
             appellant has not produced a viable or credible business plan.


         37.  Taking these matters together I find that  the  appellant  has
             not  satisfactorily  demonstrated  that  he   is   a   genuine
             entrepreneur s set out in paragraph 245DD(h) nor  has  he  met
             the requirements set down in paragraph 245DD(i)."


The Grounds Seeking Leave to Appeal and Oral Submissions

7.   The grounds seeking leave to appeal  assert  that  the  Judge  did  not
    understand that the appellant had the requisite  funds  despite  making
    �50,000 available to Mr Mubbshar.  The Judge was factually  wrong  when
    he referred to the appellant earning �15,000 interest on the loan to Mr
    Mubbshar.  The interest referred to by the appellant  was  interest  in
    his savings deposit account.  The Judge referred to the family business
    in Pakistan but in fact it is located in Germany.  The  Judge  did  not
    accept that the funds were inherited  but  the  appellant  is  able  to
    produce an affidavit establishing this.  The Judge did not consider the
    letter from the business consultant who drafted the business  plan  and
    assisted with the market research.  It is asserted the Judge failed  to
    consider Article 8 of the 1950 Convention on Human Rights.

8.    In oral submissions Ms Kansal relied on her  skeleton  argument.   The
    thrust of her argument is that the Judge was wrong  in  requiring  that
    the appellant needed to satisfy the respondent as to the source of  the
    funds. The appellant had the funds in his  own  account  and  that  was
    sufficient. The Judge approached the genuine test  erroneously  because
    he considered it mandatory that there was evidence  of  the  source  of
    funds prior to making an assessment under 245DD.  The factors listed at
    (i)(i)-(vii) are  to  be  considered  together  and  not  individually.
    Therefore the Judge in making a credibility assessment should have also
    considered the appellant's level of education, his immigration history,
    that the business has already been set up and the  additional  evidence
    in the bundle such as that from the appellant's mother.

9.   The interpretation of the word "source" at 245DD (i)(ii) does not  mean
    that the appellant must provide a lengthy  paper  trail  of  the  money
    which he intends to use.  The nature of  the  factors  in  (i)  are  to
    assist with the assessment under (h).   In  the  appellant's  case  the
    evidence was always that the money was coming from his bank account  in
    Pakistan which was held in his name.  The decision maker is not obliged
    to look any further than this and to  do  so  places  an  unduly  harsh
    burden on an appellant.

10.  Ms Kansal referred to the  case  of  Akinci  (paragraph  21  HC  510  -
    correct approach) [2012] UKUT 00266 (IAC) in relation to  the  business
    plan submitted by the appellant.

11.  It was conceded by Ms Kansal  that  there  was  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal no  evidence  from  the  appellant's  mother  as  contrary  to
    assertions made in  her  skeleton  argument.   An  affidavit  from  the
    appellant's mother has now been obtained, but this was not  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal or the decision maker.

12.  Ms Kansal referred me to the policy guidance at paragraph  35  (Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) policy guidance version 11/2014).

13.    Mr Walker made submissions in the context of the response under  Rule
    24 of the 2008 Procedure Rules.  He referred me to paragraph 34 of  the
    determination and the appellant's interview (specifically  question  17
    and the appellant's answer). Ms Kansal responded and referred me to the
    interview in its entirety and specifically questions 17 and 20 and  the
    appellant's answers.

The Immigration Rules

14.  Paragraph 245DD contains the requirements for  leave  to  remain  as  a
    Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant and the relevant limbs of paragraph 245DD
    in this case are (h) - (j) and they read as follows

         "(h) Except where the applicant has, or was last granted, leave  as
             a Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)  Migrant,  a  Businessperson  or  an
             Innovator and is being assessed under Table 5 of  Appendix  A,
             the Secretary of State must be satisfied that:


             (i)  the applicant genuinely:


                  (1)  intends and is able to establish, take over or become
                      a director of one or more businesses in the UK within
                      the next six months, or


                  (2)  has established, taken over or become a  director  of
                      one or more businesses in the  UK  and  continues  to
                      operate that business or businesses; and


             (ii) the applicant  genuinely  intends  to  invest  the  money
                  referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A in  the  business  or
                  businesses referred to in (i);


             (iii)    the money referred to in Table 4  of  Appendix  A  is
                  genuinely available to  the  applicant,  and  will  remain
                  available to him until such time as it is  spent  for  the
                  purposes of his business or businesses.


             (iv) that the applicant does not intend to make employment  in
                  the United Kingdom other than under the terms of paragraph
                  245DE.


         (i)  In making the assessment in (h), the Secretary of  State  will
             assess the balance of probabilities.  The Secretary  of  State
             may take into account the following factors:


             (i)  the evidence the applicant has submitted;


             (ii) the viability and credibility of the source of the  money
                  referred to in Table 4 of Appendix A;


             (iii)    the viability  and  credibility  of  the  applicant's
                  business plans  and  market  research  into  their  chosen
                  business sector.


             (iv)  the  applicant's  previous  educational   and   business
                  experience (or lack thereof);


             (v)  the applicant's immigration history and previous activity
                  in the UK;


             (vii)    where the applicant has already registered in the  UK
                  as self-employed or as the director of a business, and the
                  nature of the business requires  mandatory  accreditation,
                  registration and/or insurance, whether that accreditation,
                  registration and/or insurance has been obtained: and


             (viii)   any other relevant information.

         (j)   The  Secretary  of  State  reserves  the  right  to   request
             additional information and evidence to support the  assessment
             in (h), and to refuse the application if  the  information  or
             evidence is not provided.  Any  requested  documents  must  be
             received by the Secretary of State at the address specified in
             the request within  28  calendar  days  of  the  date  of  the
             request."

Conclusions

15.  The appellant was interviewed by the Secretary of State on 11  February
    2014 and at question 17 he was asked about the funding of his  business
    and where he got the funds to invest.  His answer  was  "my  own  money
    �50,000, being all my funds".

16.  At question 20 he was asked whether  the  funds  are  held  in  a  bank
    account in the UK or overseas and his answer is as follows:-

         "Overseas account, that's my own account and it's a savings account
         so didn't invest as whilst its over there its still  earning  money
         as I did not know how long I needed to wait.  Once I  get  my  visa
         ill bring it over."

17.  The Secretary of State in the decision letter states as follows:

         "You have submitted a personal bank  account  in  the  name  of  Mr
         Shahid Ali as evidence that you have funds of �50,000 to invest  in
         your company.


         When asked in your interview  how  you  obtained  the  funding  you
         replied that the money was from your own savings.


         However after checking through your current bank account statements
         there is no evidence that you  have  saved  any  of  the  money  as
         claimed.


         According to your bank statements you receive a monthly  salary  of
         between �592 and �900 per month from your job with Compass who  are
         a catering and cleaning company.


         I do not find it credible that you would be able to save �50,000 of
         your own money whilst living and maintaining yourself in the UK.


         You have submitted a personal bank account in the name of Mr Shahid
         Ali as evidence that you have funds of �50,000 to  invest  in  your
         company.
         However we have received an application for a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur)
         visa from Muhammad Mubbshar of [address] which is the same  address
         as yourself, along with a third party letter signed by yourself and
         which also contains a copy of your passport.


         The letter which has been verified by your solicitors Farani-Javid-
         Taylor as signed and  valid  states  that  you  have  made  �50,000
         available to Muhammad Mubbshar as a third party to  invest  in  his
         business along with a copy of your bank statements which show  your
         name and sort code and also the same balance as the ones  that  had
         been submitted with your application.


         As you have made this funding available  to  your  friend  Muhammad
         Mubbshar to invest in his business this means that the funds listed
         on your bank account are not available to  yourself  to  invest  in
         Unique Accountants Ltd.


         In view of  the  concerns  I  am  not  satisfied  that  �50,000  of
         investment funds are genuinely available  or  that  you  intend  to
         invest them  as  it  appeared  that  these  funds  have  been  made
         available on paper solely to meet the requirements of your  Tier  1
         (Entrepreneur) Visa application."

18.  In my view, the Judge understood the appellant's case  in  relation  to
    the funds and the loan to Mr Mubbshar.   He  recorded  the  appellant's
    grounds of appeal at paragraph 22 of the determination.  He  understood
    that the appellant's evidence was that he had funds available to invest
    in Mr Mubbshar's business and in his own business.  However, the  Judge
    did not find that the appellant had established that the funds  in  his
    account were genuinely available to him and that he intended to  invest
    the money in his business.  The reason the Judge did not accept this is
    because he was not satisfied as to the provenance of the money held  in
    the appellant's bank account.  He gave clear and  detailed  reasons  at
    paragraphs 33 and 34.

19.  The appellant  was  not  asked  questions  in  any  detail  during  his
    interview about the provenance of the funds. However, from the  answers
    he gave (specifically the answer to question 17) the decision maker was
    entitled to conclude that the appellant's  evidence  was  that  he  had
    saved the sum of money. In any event, it is clear from the Secretary of
    State's decision that the provenance of the funds was  an  issue.  From
    the answers given  by  the  appellant  during  the  interview  and  the
    evidence in relation to Mr Mubbshar's application it was understandable
    that the Secretary of State concluded that the money was not  available
    to the appellant and that the appellant did  not  genuinely  intend  to
    invest the money in his business. It was open to the Judge to find that
    this undermined the appellant's credibility.

 20. The Judge considered the evidence and he  found  the  appellant  to  be
    lacking in credibility.  There is no reason to believe that  the  Judge
    did not take into consideration the evidence in the round including all
    the factors listed at 245DD (i). He did not attach undue weight to  the
    viability and credibility of the source of money (245DD (i) (ii)).  The
    Judge understood that the appellant's evidence was now that  the  money
    was not savings but from  his  family  business  and  that  the  family
    business was based on sales of clothes  into  the  German  market  (see
    [32]). He was entitled to  conclude  that  there  was  no  evidence  in
    relation to the location of the business (see [33]).  The Judge did not
    accept the evidence in relation to the family business wherever it  was
    located.  Whether the Judge erred in relation to  �15,000  interest  is
    immaterial.

21.  The Judge did not require  a  paper  trail.   There  is  no  reason  to
    believe that he applied a too high standard of proof in this case.  The
    findings must be considered in  the  context  of  the  failure  of  the
    appellant to explain clearly during his interview the provenance of the
    funds and his failure to provide cogent evidence of this.  It  is  very
    clear from the Reasons for Refusal Letter that the  provenance  of  the
    funds was a relevant issue and indeed it is an issue that the appellant
    sought, inadequately in my view, to address in his evidence and grounds
    of  appeal.    It  was  open  to  the  Judge  to  conclude   that   the
    circumstances of the loan to  Mr  Mubbshar  raised  further  doubts  in
    relation to the appellant's credibility.

22.  The decision in Akinci is not very helpful in this case.   The  problem
    in relation to the appellant's business plan is that it  was  according
    to the Secretary State "heavily based on the business plans found on  a
    named  website."   The  Judge  concluded  at  [36]   that   there   are
    "justifiable doubts about the originality of the  appellant's  business
    plan".  The Judge found that the business plan was plagiarised  and  in
    my view this was a conclusion that was open to  him  on  the  evidence.
    The grounds assert that the Judge failed to take into  consideration  a
    letter from Alcove Investments Ltd and an invoice  from  a  consultancy
    firm which assisted the appellant to  prepare  the  business  plan  and
    business advisory services generally including marketing.  Having  read
    the determination as a whole in my view there is no reason  to  believe
    that the Judge did not take these documents into account.   It  is  not
    necessary for the Judge to make findings on each  and  every  piece  of
    evidence.  In any event any  error  in  this  regard  is  not  material
    because the Judge makes a clear lawful and sustainable finding that the
    appellant  has  failed  to  establish  that  the  funds  are  genuinely
    available to him.

23.      I have considered whether the  respondent  should  have  considered
    asking for further evidence from the appellant about the provenance  of
    the funds, but this has not been raised in the grounds seeking leave or
    the original grounds of appeal.  In any event, from the  interview  the
    respondent was entitled to conclude that it was  the  appellant's  case
    that he had saved the money not that  he  had  inherited  it  from  the
    family business (which was his evidence before the FtT).  There is  now
    an affidavit from the appellant's mother. This was not before the  FtT.
    It is not particularly detailed and in and in the light of the evidence
    as a whole if I were to remake the decision and  if  the  evidence  was
    admissible, in the context of the evidence as a whole, in my  view,  it
    is not reliable.

24.  The Judge did not make a finding in relation to Article 8 of  the  1950
    Convention on Human Rights. The grounds of appeal before the  FtT  make
    no reference to article 8. It does not appear  that  it  was  an  issue
    raised by counsel at the hearing before the FtT.   In  any  event,  the
    appellant's evidence does not  establish  that  he  has  a  significant
    family or private life in the UK that would engage the Convention.

25.  The decision to dismiss the  appeal  under  the  Immigration  Rules  is
    maintained.  The appeal is dismissed under article 8.
