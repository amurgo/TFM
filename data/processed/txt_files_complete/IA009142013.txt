For the Appellant:     Mr T Uddin of Immigration 4U
For the Respondent:    Mr P Nath, Senior  Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS



1.   The Secretary of State appeals, with permission, against a decision  of
    Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Wyman  who,  in  a  determination
    promulgated on 8 May 2013, allowed the appeal of Md Saeed Hasan against
    a decision of the Secretary of State made on 2 January 2013  to  refuse
    the appellant's application for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom
    as a Tier 4 (General) Student.

2.   Although the Secretary of State is the appellant in the  appeal  before
    me I will refer to her as the respondent in this determination  as  she
    was the respondent in the First-tier Tribunal. Similarly,  although  Md
    Saeed Hasan is the respondent in this appeal, I will refer  to  him  as
    the appellant as he was the appellant in the First-tier Tribunal.

3.   The appellant was granted leave to enter Britain in January 2008  as  a
    student, being given leave until 30 April 2011.  On 25 January 2012  he
    was granted further leave to remain in Britain as a  Tier  4  (General)
    Student until 30 July 2012. He made an application on 30  July  for  an
    extension of stay as a student.  He did not, at  that  date,  have  the
    necessary certificate of proficiency in English.

4.   On 16 August 2012 UKBA wrote  to  him  thank  him  for  his  "attempted
    application for leave to  remain".   They  went  on  to  say  that  his
    application was invalid and that the application form was returned. The
    reason being given that "although credit/ debit card details  had  been
    provided the issuing bank rejected the payment". He was invited to make
    a further application. The writer of the letter stated:

         "The making of a valid application that is one in the correct  form
         which complies with the above requirements does not  guarantee  the
         application will be successful. The application will be  considered
         on its  own  merits  and  where  appropriate,  in  accordance  with
         Immigration Rules, and published policy."

5.   The appellant then made a further application for leave  to  remain  on
    13 September 2012. This application  was  sent  with  a  CAS  dated  12
    September 2012 and the English language test certificate which had been
    issued on 12 September 2012.

6.     That application was refused on 2 January 2013 on the basis that  the
    appellant did not meet the maintenance requirements  of  the  Rules  in
    that it was not accepted  that  he  had  an  established  presence  for
    studying in Britain because his application was not made in  time.   It
    was stated that at the time of his application on 13 September 2012  he
    no longer had any valid leave to remain and therefore did not  have  an
    established presence in the United Kingdom. Therefore he would  require
    funds of �1,000 a month for  nine  months  being  a  total  of  �9,000.
    However the appellant had  only  produced  bank  statements  showing  a
    balance of �4,002 during the relevant period.

7.   Section C of the letter of refusal stated as follows:

         "You made an application on 13 September 2012. However, your  leave
         to remain expired on 30 July 2012.   You  therefore  did  not  have
         leave to remain at the time of your application. There is no  right
         of appeal against the decision."

8.   The appellant was informed of his liability to be removed.

9.   The appellant's grounds of appeal stated inter alia that he had made  a
    combined application for leave  to  remain  in  Britain  as  a  Tier  4
    (General) Student Migrant on 13 September 2012.  Although  the  grounds
    of appeal acknowledge that he had been told that he did  not  have  any
    right of appeal as it was alleged that he did not have valid  leave  in
    Britain at the time of making his application, it was  stated  that  he
    denied that allegation and submitted that the Secretary  of  State  had
    failed to properly consider  his  submitted  documents  and  wrongfully
    refused his application.  The grounds asserted that  he  had  made  his
    first application on 30 July 2012 within the limit of his  valid  leave
    and a post office receipt dated that date and an acknowledgment dated 1
    August 2012 was produced.  It was stated the application  was  returned
    because of non-payment of fees and therefore the application  had  been
    re-sent on 13 September 2012.

10.  It was  stated  that  the  appellant  relied  on  the  decision  in  JH
    (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA Civ 78 alleging that the second application  was
    a continuation and variation of the variation of the first  application
    and should be treated as a first application. It was submitted that the
    appellant had satisfied the Immigration Rules.

11.  The grounds of appeal  included  a  "Plea  for  right  of  appeal"  and
    asserted that the appellant should be given  an  in  country  right  of
    appeal and asserted that for him not to be granted a  right  of  appeal
    was a "gross mistake of injustice".

12.  At the appeal before Judge Wyman there was no appearance on  behalf  of
    the Secretary of State.  Judge Wyman noted the appellant's  application
    had been  returned due to  non-payment of fees and that the application
    had been re-sent on 13 September  2012.   The  judge  referred  to  the
    judgment in JH (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA  Civ  78  and  stated  that  that
    judgment:

         "reports  that  the  second  application  in  such   cases   is   a
         continuation of a variation of the first  application.  Accordingly
         the appellant has satisfied the Immigration Rules."

13.  The judge went on to consider the merits of the appeal stating that  it
    was the appellant's evidence that he  had  had  to  obtain  an  English
    language certificate and he had been unable to do this before his leave
    expired. He had been booked to take the English language course  on  15
    August but that test was cancelled.   He  then  had  to  wait  until  1
    September 2012 to take the  test.  The  results  had  come  out  on  12
    September and the appellant had then sent them in on  13  September  to
    the Home Office.

14.  The judge had before her a copy of the Immigration  (Leave  to  Remain)
    Regulations 2007 which was provided by the  appellant's  representative
    as well as copies of the original letter from the UK Borders Agency  of
    1 August confirming receipt of the application and the second from UKBA
    dated 16 August stating that the specified fee had not been paid.

15.  In paragraphs 21 onwards of the determination the  judge  set  out  her
    findings. She referred to the "evidential flexibility"  policy  and  to
    the determination in Rodriguez [2013] UKUT 00042 (IAC).   In  paragraph
    25 of the determination the judge stated:

         "In this case the appellant appears to have  made  two  significant
         errors. The first is when he submitted the application he  did  not
         provide his correct bank details. The second was  at  the  time  of
         submitting the application,  he  had  not  even  taken,  let  alone
         passed, his English language tests."

16.  She stated, however, that following the judgment in JH  (Zimbabwe)  any
    application  should  be  treated  as  a  continuation  of   the   first
    application and therefore the appellant had an established presence  in
    British which required a lower level of maintenance and that  had  been
    met by appellant.

17.  However the judge went on to state in paragraphs 29 and 30:

         "29. However with respect to the issue of the  appellant's  English
             language certificate, I propose to remit this case back to the
             Secretary of State for their further consideration.


         30.  Accordingly, I allow the appeal to the limited extent that the
             case  is  now  sent  back  to  the  Home  Office  for  further
             considerations of the appellant's case."


18.  The Secretary of State appealed arguing that the  judge  had  erred  by
    failing to "adequately reason" why the appellant had submitted a  valid
    application and had  a  right  of  appeal.  It  was  claimed  that  the
    appellant did not have a valid leave at the time of the application was
    made.

19.  It was pointed out that it appeared to be accepted by  the  judge  that
    the appellant could not meet the Immigration Rules and therefore it was
    stated that the determination in Rodriguez was not relevant.

20.  Upper Tribunal Judge Poole granted  permission  to  appeal  on  22  May
    2013.

21.  At the hearing of the appeal before me Mr Nath relied  on  the  grounds
    of appeal emphasising the appellant had not had valid leave to remain -
    his application in July had been ruled invalid because he had not  paid
    the fee.  Moreover the appellant  had  not  had  the  English  language
    certificate when he had made the application.

22.  In reply Mr  Uddin  stated  that  the  issue  of  whether  or  not  the
    appellant had a right of appeal against the refusal of 2  January  2013
    have been considered by Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Robinson  in
    March. He argued,  moreover,  that  the  application  was  a  continued
    application because it had been refused although there had not  been  a
    right of appeal.  He also argued that the determination should stand.



23.  The first issue before me is whether or not there was  a  valid  appeal
    before the Immigration Judge.

24.  As noted above, the refusal letter stated that there was  no  right  of
    appeal and the appeal had been made  after  the  appellant's  leave  to
    remain had expired.  The reality is that if that assertion  is  correct
    the appellant would not be entitled  to  a  right  of  appeal.  In  the
    determination in LS (Post decision evidence; directions; appealability)
    Gambia [2005] UKAIT 00085 the Tribunal wrote in paragraph 16:

         "The third issue which arose at the hearing of the  appeal  is  not
         mentioned in the grounds, but arises from the underlying facts.  As
         we have already indicated, the application which was the subject of
         the refusal, and of the adjudicator's determination, was made on  2
         April 2003. At that time, the appellant had no leave to  remain  in
         the United Kingdom:  his  leave  had  expired  on  31  March  2003.
         Examination of the appellant's passport at  the  hearing  confirmed
         that date. There is no process by which  leave  to  remain  in  the
         United Kingdom could  be granted other than by writing as  required
         by Section 4(1) of the 1971 Act.  Nobody has pointed to any writing
         extending the appellant's leave for the  necessary  two  days.  The
         consequence of this is very serious indeed.  Although  when  making
         his decision in  this  case,  the  respondent  indicated  that  the
         appellant had no right of appeal, that was not correct. The refusal
         of leave to remain in respect of a person who does not  have  leave
         at the time the decision is made is not a decision appealable under
         Section 82(2) of the 2002 Act. That is because the lack  of  extant
         leave means that the decision is not a  refusal  to  vary  existing
         leave: and, in addition, if the person has no extant  leave  it  is
         not the case that the 'result of the refusal is that  the  person's
         sole leave to enter or remain': he had not such leave  even  before
         the refusal despite the somewhat lengthy process in this case,  the
         position of the appellant never had any right of appeal."

25.  In the following paragraph the Tribunal wrote:

         "Insofar as we have power to do so we  declare  that  the  decision
         against which the appellant purported to appeal was not a  decision
         carrying a right of appeal under the 2002 Act; that the adjudicator
         accordingly had no jurisdiction; and  that  his  determination  and
         direction can have no effect. To that extent,  the  parties  should
         proceed as though the separate had been appeals had been allowed in
         full  and  we  had  subsisted  a   determination   dismissing   the
         appellant's appeal to the adjudicator."

26.  Although, in this case, Mr Uddin argued that the issue  of  whether  or
    not there was a right of appeal had been  properly  considered  in  the
    appellant's favour at a preliminary hearing  in  March  that  does  not
    appear to be the case from the file before me.  The matter does  appear
    to have been argued before Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Robinson.
    His note of the proceedings states:

         "A appears.


         Issue of validity of in country appeal.  A claim  sent  application
         form in prior to expiry of visa. It is not clear if he  quoted  his
         CAS details in it.  If so,  it  should  be  valid  appeal.  Request
         adjournment to bring in application form covering letters  sent  in
         on 30/7/2011 (respondent does not have a copy).  Adjourn  to  first
         open date after 1/4/2013.

27.  The issue of whether or not  there  was  a  valid  appeal  was  not,  I
    consider, properly considered by  Judge  Wyman.  She  referred  to  the
    judgment in JH (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA Civ 79  stating  that  that  said
    that a second application was a continuation of a variation of a  first
    application. That assertion is, however, incorrect:  what  happened  in
    the case of JH (Zimbabwe) was that the "second  application"  was  made
    after an appeal had been lodged and while the appellant had leave under
    Section 3C of the  Immigration Act 1971.  In this case  no  appeal  was
    lodged against the refusal by the Secretary of State on 16  August  and
    in reality it was not argued  that  the  refusal  carried  a  right  of
    appeal.  There was no attempt to lodge an appeal after the refusal  and
    therefore no 3C leave applied.

28.  That being the case the application made on 13 September  was  a  fresh
    application made when the appellant did not have leave to  remain.  For
    the reasons given in the determination of the Tribunal in  LS  (Gambia)
    the appellant would therefore not  have a right of appeal.

29.  I would point out that, in any event, should the appellant have  had  a
    right to appeal the decision set out in the letter of  16  August  that
    appeal could not have succeeded because at that stage he did  not  have
    the certificate of proficiency in English.

30.  If there had at one time been an argument that  the  application  would
    be deemed to be under consideration until  there  had  been  a  further
    decision that would clearly no longer be sustainable after the judgment
    of the Court of Appeal in Raju [2013] EWCA Civ  775.  This  was,  after
    all, a points-based system application.

31.  I would add moreover that the reference by the First-tier  Tribunal  to
    a policy  of  "evidential  flexibility"  is  similarly  incorrect.  The
    principles set out in the determination in Rodriguez [2013] UKUT  00042
    (IAC) could only have effect if there is material evidence which was in
    existence and had not been submitted which could  have  been  requested
    by the respondent. The reality is that the English test certificate was
    submitted with the application.   I  do  not  see  that  therefore  the
    "evidential flexibility" policy has any relevance in this case.

32.  Moreover the judge stated that she allowed the appeal "to  the  limited
    extent that the case is now sent back to the Home  Office  for  further
    consideration of the appellant's case".

33.  That is a procedure which could really only be  used  if  the  decision
    was not in accordance with the law.  In this case the decision  was  in
    accordance with the law.  The judge was therefore wrong  to  allow  the
    appeal to the limited extent  which  she  did  but,  in  any  event,  I
    conclude that there was no valid appeal for the reasons  which  I  have
    set out above.


34.  I therefore, having found that there are material errors of law in  the
    determination, set aside the decision of the Immigration Judge allowing
    this appeal and make my own decision which, following the procedure  in
    LS (Gambia) is to dismiss this purported appeal.
