Representation:

For the Appellant:     None
For the Respondent:    Ms Isherwood, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan.  She was  born  on  10  October
    1965.  She appealed against the respondent's refusal to grant her entry
    clearance as a visitor dated 9 February 2015.

 2. In a decision promulgated on 30 December 2015, Judge Pears (the  judge)
    allowed the appellant's appeal.  See in particular [8] of the decision.

 3. The grounds claim the judge made a material misdirection of law.   S.52
    of the Crime  and  Courts  Act  came  into  effect  on  25  June  2013,
    restricting  the  appeal  rights  for  visitors  with  regard  to   any
    applications made on or after 25 June 2013.  The changes  made  amended
    s.88A of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002  as  inserted
    by the 2006 Act which removed the rights of appeal for persons visiting
    specified family members except on  human  rights  and  race  relations
    grounds under s.84(1)(b) and (c) of the 2002 Act.

 4. The judge failed to make any findings with regard to the only available
    rights of appeal under s.84(1)(b) and (c) of the  2002  Act.   Further,
    the judge failed to  have  regard  to  the  statutory  public  interest
    considerations under s.117B of the 2002 Act.

Submissions on Error of Law

 5. Ms Isherwood relied upon the grounds.

Conclusion on Error of Law

 6. The refusal correctly identified  the  appellant's  limited  rights  of
    appeal.  I find the Entry Clearance Manager's subsequent  review  dated
    30 June 2015 confusing in that whilst he refers to the limited right of
    appeal, he goes on to say  "I  kindly  ask  the  Immigration  Judge  to
    consider the appellant's right to a full  appeal  in  the  interest  of
    continuity and fairness before considering her grounds for  appeal  any
    further."  What that sentence means I do not know,  however,  it  might
    have misled the judge into thinking he was  being  asked  to  take  all
    factors into account, notwithstanding that this was a limited right  of
    appeal.  Be that as it may,  Virk  [2013]  EWCA  Civ  652  at  [23]  is
    authority that statutory jurisdiction cannot be conferred by waiver  or
    agreement or the failure of the parties or the Tribunal to be alive  to
    the point.

 7. The grounds of appeal raised human rights issues with which  the  judge
    did not engage.

 8. The respondent has shown errors of law in the decision such that I  set
    it aside so it can be heard again de novo.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contains  errors  of  law,  is  set
