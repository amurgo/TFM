For the Respondent:    Ms M Sardar, instructed by Oliver & Hasani
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

This is an appeal by the Secretary of State for the Home Department  against
the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  Mr  Gjoniku's  appeal
against the decision of  25  April  2019  to  deprive  him  of  his  British
nationality under section 40(3) of the British Nationality Act 1981.

For the purposes of  this  decision,  we  shall  hereinafter  refer  to  the
Secretary of State as the  respondent  and  Mr  Gjoniku  as  the  appellant,
reflecting their positions as they were in the appeal before the  First-tier
Tribunal.

The appellant is a national of Albania, born on 2 February 1980. He  arrived
in the UK in 1998 and claimed asylum on the grounds  of  being  at  risk  on
return  to  Kosovo  as  an  ethnic  Albanian,  stating  that  he  came  from
Prishtine, Kosovo, and giving a date of  birth  as  2  April  1981.  He  was
granted asylum and indefinite leave  to  remain  on  14  May  1999  and  was
subsequently naturalised as a British citizen on 18 May  2005,  all  on  the
basis of what he now accepts were false representations  in  regard  to  his
date of birth and nationality.

The appellant married his wife, an  Albanian  national,  in  Albania  on  28
August 2003 and had three children born  in  Albania,  on  24  May  2005,  4
November 2011 and 4 June 2016, all of whom remained and still remain  living
in Albania.  As  a  result  of  his  British  citizenship,  the  appellant's
children are British citizens.

 The appellant's false identity  came  to  light  when  he  applied  to  Her
Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO) for a  British  passport  for  his  son  in
2018. Following an investigation by the Status Review Unit (SRU),  the  Home
Office wrote  to  the  appellant  on  18  January  2019  advising  him  that
consideration was being given to depriving him of  his  British  citizenship
on the basis of fraud  and  inviting  a  response  to  the  allegation.  The
appellant  responded  on  4  February  2019,  admitting  to  the  deception,
accepting his genuine identity and providing mitigating  circumstances  such
as the rise of violence and civil unrest  in  Albania.  The  appellant  also
claimed to have been advised by his solicitor and interpreter to give  false
details about his place and date of  birth,  despite  having  provided  them
with his genuine birth  certificate.  The  respondent  did  not  accept  the
appellant's explanation as a justification for the deception  and  concluded
that his British citizenship had been obtained fraudulently. The  respondent
decided, in a decision dated 25 April 2019, that he should  be  deprived  of
his British citizenship under section 40(3) of the British  Nationality  Act
1981.

The appellant appealed against that decision under  section  40A(1)  of  the
British Nationality Act 1981. His appeal was heard on 16 July 2019 by First-
tier Tribunal Judge Atreya. There was no oral evidence before the judge  and
the appeal proceeded on the basis of submissions only.  The  judge  accepted
that the appellant was advised by solicitors/ interpreters to lie about  his
nationality and date of birth, that he was a very young adult when  he  came
to the UK and had been dependent upon his  parents  prior  to  coming  here,
that he may have been influenced by others and that he had  apologised   for
his actions, but she noted  that  it  remained  the  position  that  he  had
deliberately misled the respondent as to  his  country  of  origin  and  had
continued to lie in his applications up to 2005 when he was  an  adult.  The
judge observed that the appellant had been employed by the same  company  in
the UK for almost 20 years since 1999  and  had  paid  taxes,  that  he  had
significant savings from his work,  that  he  was  a  bread-winner  and  had
supported his family from his work in the UK,  that  he  had  not  committed
criminal offences in  the  UK,  that  he  was  married  with  three  British
children and that the family  were  suffering  because  of  the  uncertainty
caused by deprivation of his British nationality. The judge noted  that  the
consequences for the appellant  of  losing  his  British  citizenship  would
include a period of uncertainty whilst the  respondent  decided  whether  to
remove him and that he would  be  unable  to  work  or  rent  if  a  removal
decision were made and pending any appeal against such a decision,  as  well
as the advantages and privileges he would lose even if he were not  removed.


Having had regard to the guidance and principles set  out  in  recent  cases
concerning deprivation of citizenship, the judge found that the  appellant's
deception motivated the grant  of  citizenship,  that  his  nationality  was
material to the decision to grant him citizenship and that the  exercise  by
the respondent of the power to deprive him of  citizenship  was  lawful  and
fair.  The  judge  found  that,  in   such   circumstances,   the   relevant
consideration was the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deprivation  in
line with the decisions in BA (deprivation of citizenship:  appeals)  [2018]
UKUT 85 and Aziz & Ors v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2018]
EWCA Civ 1884. She considered that  the  "period  of  limbo"  in  which  the
appellant would  have  no  immigration  status,  would  be  prohibited  from
working and renting and would be at real risk  of  destitution  in  the  UK,
would have a detrimental and significant impact upon  his  family  who  were
dependent upon his remittances and would be contrary to the  best  interests
of his children. She considered that even  aside  from  the  impact  on  the
children, the impact on the appellant alone would be sufficient to make  out
the "high threshold for private life" and that  the  legal  consequences  of
deprivation would  "engage  Article  8"  such  that  the  appeal  should  be
allowed.

Permission to appeal was sought by the respondent on the  grounds  that  the
judge's limbo/destitution finding/reasoning was wholly  inadequate  in  that
it failed to take  into  account  the  appellant's  true  circumstances  and
failed to apportion appropriate weight to the public interest.  The  grounds
asserted that there was nothing on the facts of the case that would  elevate
the appellant's appeal into the category of rare, as required  by  BA,  that
the judge had failed to grapple with the factual matrix and  had  failed  to
identify what meritorious claim the  appellant  could  pursue  in  order  to
obtain status following deprivation.

Permission was granted on 25 October 2019 in the  First-tier  Tribunal.  The
matter then came before us and we  heard  submissions  on  the  question  of
whether there was an error of law in Judge Atreya's decision.

Relevant Law relating to Deprivation

Section 40 of the British Nationality Act provides as follows:

         "40. Deprivation of citizenship.


         (1)  In this section a reference to a person's "citizenship status"
         is a reference to his status as-


             (a)  a British citizen,


             (b)  a British overseas territories citizen,


             (c)  a British Overseas citizen,


             (d)  a British National (Overseas),


             (e)  a British protected person, or


             (f)  a British subject.


         (2)  The Secretary of State may by order  deprive  a  person  of  a
         citizenship status if the Secretary  of  State  is  satisfied  that
         deprivation is conducive to the public good.


         (3)  The Secretary of State may by order  deprive  a  person  of  a
         citizenship  status  which  results  from   his   registration   or
         naturalisation if the Secretary of  State  is  satisfied  that  the
         registration or naturalisation was obtained by means of-


             (a)  fraud,


             (b)  false representation, or


             (c)  concealment of a material fact."

Error of Law

Mr Lindsay submitted that the central error was a material  misdirection  by
the judge in her Article 8 assessment as she went no  further  than  finding
that Article 8 was engaged and did not conduct a proper balancing  exercise.
A further error arose from the judge's failure, when referring to a  "period
of limbo", to take account of the indication in  the  Secretary  of  State's
decision letter of 25 April 2019 at paragraph 36  of  the  relatively  short
period between the loss of British citizenship and  a  decision  whether  to
remove the appellant from the UK. Mr Lindsay submitted that the judge  erred
by  accepting  the  appellant's  evidence  of   having   been   advised   by
solicitors/interpreters to lie when there was only the appellant's  evidence
to support such a conclusion  and  when  there  was  no  evidence  that  the
allegation  had  been  put  to  those  solicitors  in  accordance  with  the
principles set out in  BT  (Former  solicitors'  alleged  misconduct)  Nepal
[2004] UKIAT 00311. The judge had referred to the duration of the  fraud  as
1998 to 2005, which was wrong as it was 1998 to 2018 and  the  Secretary  of
State had been unaware of the  fraud  in  2005,  which  was  material  to  a
proportionality assessment. The judge's finding that the appellant would  be
destitute ignored the fact of the appellant's savings, a  matter  raised  by
the Home Office Presenting Office at the hearing.

Ms Sardar, in her submissions, relied upon the appellant's Rule 24  response
and her skeleton argument. She submitted that in the context of  deprivation
appeals there was no statutory weighted balance  or  explicit  parliamentary
exposition of the public interest as in deportation cases  or  section  117C
of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  and  that  the  public
interest in deportation cases had a moveable rather than a fixed quality  in
any event. She submitted that the judge did consider the public interest  in
any event and was clearly aware of the fraud. Having  addressed  the  fraud,
it was open to the judge to consider countervailing factors,  which  was  in
effect a proportionality balancing exercise consistent with  [17]  and  [18]
of KV, R (On  the  Application  Of)  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department [2018] EWCA Civ 2483. There was no requirement for  there  to  be
anything exceptional. The judge considered all  relevant  matters  including
the effect of deprivation of citizenship  on  the  appellant's  family,  the
best interests of his children and his length of residence  in  the  UK  and
had  therefore  undertaken  a  proper  proportionality  assessment  and  had
addressed  all  the  relevant  Razgar  steps.  Length   of   residence   was
particularly important as the Home Office policy  previously  in  place  had
been that deprivation would not occur after 14 years' residence in  the  UK,
and the immigration rules now  recognised  the  significance  of  20  years'
residence. With regard to the  appellant's  savings,  the  judge  was  fully
aware of these but noted that there was no  evidence  of  the  limbo  period
being for a limited time. Although the respondent gave a  time-line  in  the
deprivation decision, that did  not  take  account  of  the  fact  that  the
appellant had said he would make a  human  rights  application  which  would
then have to be considered by the  respondent  and,  if  refused,  would  be
followed by an appeal. That was the time-line referred to by  the  judge  at
[61] and she was entitled to find that the period of time was uncertain.  As
to the assertion in the grounds that the appellant could return  to  Albania
voluntarily, he had a right to remain in the UK until a  decision  was  made
to remove him.

Having considered the submissions we advised the parties that, in our  view,
the judge's decision contained material errors of law in that  there  was  a
misdirection of law by failing to assessing proportionality  and  a  failure
to take material matters into account including the respondent's  indication
of the time-line for any period of limbo. We indicated that  we  would  give
full reasons in our decision, which we now do.

We agree with Mr Lindsay that the  judge's  decision  showed  a  failure  to
accord  weight  to  the  public   interest   and   to   undertake   a   full
proportionality balancing exercise. We accept, as Ms Sardar submitted,  that
the judge plainly gave consideration  to  the  appellant's  fraud.  However,
that appeared in the earlier part  of  her  decision  where  she  considered
whether the precedent facts were made out and whether the  exercise  of  the
power to deprive the appellant of citizenship was  fair  and  lawful.  There
was nothing to indicate, in her findings at [50] and  from  [54]  where  she
considered Article 8 and properly directed herself  on  the  relevant  issue
being the "reasonably foreseeable consequences  of  deprivation",  that  she
gave any weight to  the  public  interest  in  so  doing.  Her  decision  is
expressed in terms of Article  8  being  engaged  but  contains  no  further
balancing exercise taking account of the public interest. Ms Sardar, in  her
submissions, sought to downplay the significance of the public  interest  in
the context of deprivation appeals, asserting that there  was  no  statutory
weighted  balance  or  explicit  parliamentary  exposition  of  the   public
interest as in deportation cases or section 117C of the  2002  Act.  However
the significance of the public interest in deprivation cases was  emphasised
in Deliallisi (British citizen: deprivation appeal: Scope) [2013]  UKUT  439
at [36] and [37]:

         "36. ... In cases of the  present  kind,  the  application  by  the
         respondent of her policy on deprivation must be taken as indicating
         where, as a general matter, the respondent  considers  the  balance
         falls to be struck,  as  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the  public
         interest in maintaining the integrity of  immigration  control  and
         the rights flowing from British citizenship, and, on the other, the
         interests of the individual concerned and of others  likely  to  be
         affected by that person's ceasing to be a British citizen.   As  in
         similar appeals governed by the 2002 Act,  the  appellate  tribunal
         must give the respondent's policy due weight, bearing in mind  that
         it is the respondent - rather than the judiciary - who is primarily
         responsible for determining and safeguarding public policy in these
         areas.


         37.  So far as the ECHR is concerned, in most cases (including  the
         present) the provision most likely to  be  in  play  is  Article  8
         (respect for private and family  life).   If,  on  the  facts,  the
         appellate tribunal is satisfied  that  depriving  an  appellant  of
         British   citizenship   would   constitute    a    disproportionate
         interference with the Article 8 rights of that person or any  other
         person whose position  falls  to  be  examined  on  the  principles
         identified in Beoku-Betts [2008] UKHL 39, then plainly the tribunal
         is compelled by section 6 of the  Human  Rights  Act  1998  to  re-
         exercise discretion by finding in favour of the appellant."

That was in turn adopted in  the  case  of  BA  at  [37],  where  the  Upper
Tribunal added at [38] that:

         "In a section 40A appeal, the respondent's view should normally  be
         accorded  significant  weight:  see  Lord  Carlile  of  Berriew   v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] UKSC  60;  Hesham
         Ali v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] UKSC 60. In
         the majority of cases, the weight will be such  that  the  Tribunal
         will  have  no  proper  basis   for   exercising   its   discretion
         differently. This does not, however, mean the Tribunal is  absolved
         from the duty of deciding that issue."

and at [44]:

         "The Tribunal will be required to place significant weight  on  the
         fact that the  Secretary  of  State  has  decided,  in  the  public
         interest, that a person who has employed deception  etc  to  obtain
         British citizenship should be deprived of that status."

Such  a  position  was  endorsed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal  in  Aziz   and
subsequently in KV, albeit the Court, in the former, found  that  the  Upper
Tribunal in  those  cases  had  gone  too  far  by  endorsing  a  'proleptic
analysis' of whether an appellant would be likely to be deported or  removed
at a later stage.

Accordingly  we  disagree  with  Ms  Sardar's  submission  that  the   judge
conducted a proper Article 8 assessment and accorded weight  to  the  public
interest and we find that the judge plainly materially erred in law in  this
respect. We also find merit in the other assertions made in the grounds  and
by Mr Lindsay as to the judge's failure to take account of relevant  matters
such as the respondent's indication of a time-line for making a decision  on
the appellant's  immigration  status  subsequent  to  the  loss  of  British
citizenship, the  lack  of  consideration  of  the  appellant's  savings  in
concluding that he  would  become  destitute,  the  appellant's  ability  to
return to Albania and support his  family  there  and  the   period  of  the
deception.

Disposal of the Appeal and Adjournment Request

Having advised the parties of our conclusion that Judge Atreya erred in  law
in her decision to the extent stated,  we  invited  submissions  as  to  the
disposal of the appeal.

Ms Sardar's initial request was that the case be remitted to the  First-tier
Tribunal  as  the  appellant  had  further   evidence   of   his   financial
circumstances which needed to be considered. She  also  submitted  that  the
case should be stayed  behind  a  similar  case  in  which  her  instructing
solicitors were also involved, Hysaj, which had  been  heard  by  the  Upper
Tribunal and the decision was awaited. However we did not consider  that  it
was appropriate for the case to be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.  The
judge's findings on the appellant's  behaviour  in  deliberately  misleading
the respondent and her findings as to the lawfulness  and  fairness  of  the
deprivation decision had not been challenged and the decision was to be  re-
made  only  in  relation  to  Article  8   and   proportionality.   In   the
circumstances we saw no reason why the case should not be  retained  in  the
Upper Tribunal. We also indicated that we saw no reason  why  we  could  not
proceed to hear the case ourselves at that time, since the  only  indication
of further evidence was an application made on 20 December 2019  under  Rule
15(2A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  to  admit  a
statement from the  appellant's  wife.  Ms  Sardar,  however,  requested  an
adjournment  for  a  resumed  hearing  on  another  day.  We  then   invited
submissions on the adjournment request.

Mr Sardar submitted that an  adjournment  was  required  in  order  for  the
appellant's wife's statement to be admitted and considered; for evidence  of
remittances to be submitted, in the form of Swift receipts  for  2014,  2016
and 2017 showing money transferred from the appellant to  his  father-in-law
with whom his wife and children were living; for the appellant to give  oral
evidence explaining how he supported not only  his  wife  and  children  but
also his parents in Albania and how his inability to work  would  impact  on
him and his family; and to await the decision in Hysaj  which  involved  the
same issues as in this case including the argument in relation to the  state
of limbo. Mr Lindsay opposed the application made under Rule  15(2A)  as  it
did not comply with the Procedure Rules and the Tribunal's directions  since
there was no explanation why the evidence was not submitted  to  the  First-
tier Tribunal; he opposed the adjournment request on the  basis  that  there
was no  good  cause  for  further  oral  evidence  from  the  appellant;  he
submitted that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  already  accepted  that  the
appellant was the  breadwinner  and  therefore  the  non-admittance  of  the
remittances would not prejudice him; and he submitted that  there  had  been
no previous request by the appellant's solicitors to stay  his  case  behind
Hysaj and therefore no reason why it should be stayed.

We considered  the  adjournment  request  which  we  then  refused  for  the
following reasons. With regard to  the  application  under  Rule  15(2A)  to
admit the appellant's wife's statement, we noted that  the  application  did
not comply with the Procedure Rules since no reason had been provided as  to
why a statement had  not  been  produced  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.
However, since the statement had been produced prior to the  hearing  before
us together with an appropriate application we agreed to  admit  it,  albeit
finding no reason why an  adjournment  was  required  on  that  basis.  With
regard to the remittance receipts, there had been no application under  Rule
15(2A), there was no explanation why they had not been produced  before  the
First-tier Tribunal and they were, in any  event,  irrelevant  in  assessing
the impact of deprivation on the appellant at the current time as they  were
dated 2014, 2016 and 2017 and were thus historical and  did  not  provide  a
complete picture. We did not agree  to  admit  that  evidence.  As  for  the
appellant's oral evidence, we did not see how it would add anything  to  the
case as it had already been accepted by the First-tier Tribunal that he  was
the breadwinner. There had been no application under  Rule  15(2A),  despite
the appellant's solicitors being aware of the need for such an  application,
having made one in relation to the  appellant's  wife's  statement,  and  we
refused to admit such evidence. Finally, with regard to the case  of  Hysaj,
Ms Sardar was unable to explain how the decision in  that  case  would  have
any direct relevance to the case before us, and despite the same  solicitors
being involved in both cases, there had been  no  prior  application  for  a
stay.

In addition, the directions from the Upper Tribunal,  issued  together  with
the grant of permission and followed  by  further  directions,  specifically
required an application to be made under Rule  15(2A)  if  further  evidence
was to be relied upon, and specifically stated that there was a  presumption
that in the event of the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  being  set  aside,
the re-making of  the  decision  would  take  place  at  the  same  hearing.
Accordingly, the appellant's solicitors would have  been  fully  aware  that
the Upper Tribunal may proceed to re-make the decision  in  the  appeal  and
indeed made a Rule  15(2A)  application  to  admit  the  appellant's  wife's
statement on that understanding.  We  therefore  found  no  reason  for  the
hearing to be adjourned and considered that no procedural  unfairness  arose
from refusing to adjourn. We proceeded to hear from the  parties  in  regard
to the re-making of the decision in the appeal.

Both parties made further submissions. Ms  Sardar  relied  on  her  skeleton
argument and submitted that consideration had to be given to the  impact  of
deprivation  of  citizenship  on  the  appellant's  family,  as  his  wife's
statement confirmed that he supported both  his  immediate  family  and  his
parents. The bank statements  previously  submitted  before  the  First-tier
Tribunal showed the appellant's economic history in  the  UK  and  the  cash
withdrawals for money sent to his family, and gave the most  recent  balance
for 14 January 2019 of �5,964. That was not enough  to  support  his  family
and sustain himself during the period of limbo,  considering  the  uncertain
length  of  time  involved  whilst  his  Article  8  application  was  being
considered by the respondent and, if refused, whilst an appeal was pending.

Mr Lindsay submitted that the appellant's private life  in  the  UK  carried
very little weight and he could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph
276ADE(1)(iii) on the basis of 20 years' long residence as that was  subject
to the suitability provisions. His wife's assertions about the  difficulties
he would face integrating  and  finding  work  were  not  supported  by  any
evidence. As confirmed in the case  of  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
Department v Abbas [2017] EWCA Civ 1393 at [18],  Article  8  could  not  be
engaged on private life grounds in respect of a person  living  outside  the
UK and the appellant could not, therefore, rely on the private life  of  his
wife and children. There was no prejudice to the appellant's family life  as
he could return to Albania and reside there with his family. Section  55 of
the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 did  not  have  extra-
territorial effect.  As  for  the  reasonably  foreseeable  consequences  of
deprivation, the appellant had not shown that his  savings  would  not  last
for the period of limbo. With regard  to  the  assertion  that  that  period
would be extensive due to the appellant making  an  Article  8  application,
such an application was not capable of succeeding and it was therefore  open
to the appellant to return to Albania.

Re-making the Decision

The Court  of  Appeal,  in  the  case  of  Aziz,  made  clear  the  relevant
considerations in a deprivation case, where it endorsed  the  principles  in
Delialissi and AB, as set out at [14] and [15] above, and held at [26]:

         "Although in a sense it is of course difficult to quibble with  the
         formula in Delialissi that regard should be had to  the  reasonably
         foreseeable  consequences  of  deprivation   of   citizenship,   an
         examination of such consequences is only required insofar as it  is
         necessary to make an assessment in relation to  them  in  order  to
         rule upon whether the making of the deprivation order  itself  will
         be lawful and compatible  with  Convention  rights,  in  particular
         Article 8, and section 55.  That  will  depend  in  turn  upon  the
         reasons put forward by the Secretary of State to justify the making
         of the deprivation order."

We start by acknowledging and taking  account  of  the  public  interest  in
maintaining the integrity of immigration  control  and  the  rights  flowing
from British citizenship and we therefore give considerable  weight  to  the
fraud perpetrated by the appellant and the adverse effect on  the  interests
of the public. As the First-tier Tribunal Judge found, whilst the  appellant
claims that he was advised  by  solicitors/interpreters  to  lie  about  his
nationality when he first made his protection claim, and whilst he may  have
been a young and impressionable man at the  time  who  had  previously  been
dependent upon his family and had arrived in  a  new  country,  it  was  his
choice as an adult to maintain that deceit throughout  further  applications
and to lie in his application for naturalisation in May 2005. He  maintained
his fraud for a period of 20 years and would no doubt have continued  to  do
so had he not been discovered when he applied for  a  British  passport  for
his son. It was on the basis of his lies that he was able to obtain  refugee
status, indefinite leave and British citizenship, and was able to  work  and
continue to reside in  the  UK.   The  public  interest  in  deprivation  is
therefore strong.

It is the appellant's case, however, that the public interest is  outweighed
by his own interests and those of his family in Albania on  the  basis  that
the reasonable foreseeable consequences of deprivation  are  that  he  would
become destitute and would be  unable  to  support  his  family  during  the
period of limbo after losing his British citizenship  and  waiting  to  find
out whether the Secretary of State will seek to  remove  him  from  the  UK,
which in turn breaches his Article 8 rights. However,  we  do  not  consider
that the appellant has shown that that would be the case or  that  that  has
to be the case.

The respondent has confirmed, in the deprivation decision at [36], that  the
period between the deprivation order  and  the  decision  to  remove/  grant
leave, will be up  to  eight  weeks.  The  most  recent  evidence  from  the
appellant of  his  financial  circumstances  showed  savings  of  �5,964  in
January 2019. He did not produce any more current evidence before the First-
tier Tribunal or before the Upper Tribunal and provided no evidence to  show
that that amount would not cover his expenses for that period  of  time.  It
is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the period of "limbo" would  be
considerably longer than eight weeks, as he would be submitting  an  Article
8 human rights claim which, if refused, would then be appealed. However,  as
Mr Lindsay submitted, there can be no prospect of success in such  a  claim.
Whilst  we  are  mindful  of  the  Court  of  Appeal's  comments  about  the
inappropriateness of undertaking a proleptic assessment  of  the  likelihood
of removal, the  merits  of  an  Article  8  claim  has  to  be  a  material
consideration in addressing Ms Sardar's submission about an extended  period
of limbo.

This  is  not  a  case,  as  usually  arises,  that  the  appellant  has  an
established family life in the UK with children  who  have  integrated  into
British life. The appellant's case is unusual  as  his  family  are  all  in
Albania. Although his children are  British  citizens  and,  as  far  as  we
understand,  will  remain  so,  their  citizenship  was   enabled   by   the
appellant's fraud, albeit  that  they  retain  all  the  rights  of  British
citizens and are entitled to live in the UK. Their mother, however,  has  no
right to reside in the UK and neither she nor the children have, as  far  as
we are aware, resided in the UK with the appellant.  The  appellant's  claim
could therefore only be pursued on  private  life  grounds,  but  could  not
succeed within the immigration  rules  given  that  paragraph  276ADE(1)  is
subject to the suitability requirements  which  would  apply  to  him  as  a
result of his fraud. His private life carries  little  weight,  pursuant  to
section 117B, given the unlawful nature of his stay in the  UK.  We  do  not
agree with Ms Sardar that the respondent's  previous  policy  in  regard  to
deprivation and 14 years residence, or the significance of 20  years  within
the immigration rules, can lend any material weight in  the  proportionality
assessment and it certainly cannot be considered as amounting to  compelling
circumstances justifying a grant of leave where  the  rules  do  not  apply.
Accordingly, it cannot be the case that the appellant can successfully  rely
on a claim to be at risk of destitution during a period  of  time  which  he
chooses himself  to  prolong  by  making  an  unmeritorious  claim  with  no
prospect of success.

As Mr Lindsay submitted, it is open to the appellant to  return  to  Albania
where he has an established family life with his wife and children.  We  see
no merit in a claim that the best interests  of  his  children  lie  in  him
remaining in the UK and supporting them from here, not only because  section
55 does not  have  extra-territorial  effect,  but  also  because  the  best
interests of his children must,  more  likely,  be  for  him  to  return  to
Albania to live with them. The appellant's wife's statement  makes  repeated
reference to the children missing their  father,  as  well  as  to  his  own
parents wanting him to be with them in Albania. As for  the  assertion  made
by the appellant and in his wife's statement, that he could  not  find  work
in Albania and that there would be no means of support if he  was  not  able
to continue working in the UK, that is wholly unsupported by  any  evidence.
The evidence about the circumstances of the appellant's  wife  and  children
is not entirely consistent, as Ms Sardar repeatedly referred to  remittances
being sent to the appellant's father-in-law, with whom  they  lived,  whilst
his wife's statement was that the money was sent to  her  father-in-law  and
that she lived with her husband's parents. However even if the case  was  as
set out in the appellant's wife's  statement,  there  is  no  proper  reason
given as to why the appellant could not find employment in Albania with  the
practical skills acquired during his years of employment in the  UK  in  the
construction industry. There is no evidence of  the  family's  finances  and
living circumstances in Albania to support the claim that  they  are  solely
reliant upon the appellant's remittances.  We  give  little  weight  to  the
appellant's own evidence as he has shown himself to  be  a  person  who  has
been content to lie to the UK authorities on numerous occasions. Neither  do
we give weight to his wife's statement, as it  has  not  been  tested  under
cross-examination and is nothing more than bare assertions.  In  any  event,
it cannot be the case that an  ability  to  support  family  members  living
outside the UK is a matter which carries any significant weight,  or  indeed
any weight at all, in an Article 8 proportionality assessment.

Accordingly, we conclude that the  reasonably  foreseeable  consequences  of
deprivation for the appellant are that, for a  relatively  short  period  of
time he will be without immigration status in the  UK  whilst  awaiting  the
respondent's decision whether to remove him or grant him leave. During  that
period, if he chooses to remain in the  UK,  he  will  be  able  to  support
himself from his savings from his previous years of employment. It  is  open
to him, alternatively, to return to Albania to join his wife,  children  and
parents and maintain his family and private life there, either  prior  to  a
further decision from the respondent or subsequent to such  a  decision  and
as an alternative to pursuing a hopeless Article 8 claim in the  UK.  We  do
not accept that the reasonably foreseeable consequences of  deprivation  are
that he would become destitute or that  he  would  otherwise  be  put  in  a
position that would constitute  a  disproportionate  interference  with  his
Article 8 rights and those of his family members. For the  reasons  we  have
given, we conclude that the public interest in depriving  the  appellant  of
the  British  citizenship  he  acquired  through  fraud  and  deception  far
outweighs his individual interests and  rights  and  those  of  his  family.
There  is  no  breach  of  Article  8  arising  from  the   deprivation   of
citizenship.

DECISION

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The Secretary of State's  appeal  is  allowed
and the decision is set aside.

We re-make the decision by dismissing Mr Gjonika's appeal.
