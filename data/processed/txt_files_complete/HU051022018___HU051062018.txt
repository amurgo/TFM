Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr A Mustakim (counsel) instructed by Chambers of M
                    M Hossain
For the Respondent:    Mr L Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. I have considered whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.


2. This is an appeal by the Appellants against the  decision  of  First-tier
Tribunal Judge Powell promulgated on 27 September 2018, which dismissed  the
Appellants' appeal on all grounds.

Background


3. The second  Appellant  is  the  first  appellant's  daughter.  The  first
appellant was born on 2 January 1972. The second appellant was  born  on  25
September 1997. Both appellants are nationals of Bangladesh. On 4 July  2018
the Secretary of State refused the Appellants'  applications  for  leave  to
remain in the UK.

The Judge's Decision

4. The Appellants appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Powell ("the Judge") dismissed the  appeal  against  the  Respondent's
decision. Grounds of appeal were lodged and on 30 October  2018  Judge  Gibb
granted permission to appeal stating inter alia

      1. The appellant's, citizens of  Bangladesh,  were  refused  leave  on
      24/01/2018, and their appeals against removal were  dismissed  by  the
      Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Powell (promulgated on 27.09.2018).


      2. The grounds, which were in time, complaint that the Judge erred in:
      1) failing to address additional grounds and evidence showing that the
      requirements of the rules were met; (2) not considering the  situation
      at the date of hearing; (3) not giving adequate consideration to delay
      and the proportionality of the entry clearance option.


      3. The grounds are arguable. The Judge arguably erred in  framing  the
      approach to article 8 on the basis of whether the appellants  met  the
      rules at the date of decision rather than at the date of hearing ( see
      [26]).  This  arguably  led  to  the  exclusion  from  the  article  8
      proportionality assessment of a highly  relevant  factor,  namely  the
      ability of the appellants to meet the requirements of the rules at the
      date of hearing.

The Hearing

5. (a) For the appellants, Mr Mustakim moved the grounds of appeal. He  said
the Judge failed to address the additional grounds contain in a section  120
notice, that the Judge had not considered  the  situation  at  the  date  of
hearing, but had restricted his consideration to the date of  decision,  and
that the Judge had failed to  take  account  of  the  delay  in  reaching  a
decision.

(b) Mr Mustakin took me to [26] of the decision, where, he says,  the  Judge
restricted his consideration to the circumstances at the date  of  decision.
He reminded me that in  this  case  the  application  was  submitted  on  18
September 2015. The respondent issued a refusal decision 17  December  2015.
Both appellants appealed against that decision.  The  appeal  hearings  were
originally listed to be heard on  28  April  2017.  On  27  April  2017  the
respondent withdrew that decision, and it was  not  until  24  January  2018
that the respondent made the decision against which the appellant's  appeal.
He told me that the procedural history discloses  a  relevant  consideration
which the judge had not considered.

(c) Mr Mustakin told me  that  between  the  date  of  application  and  the
decision made on 24 January  2018  there  has  been  a  material  change  in
circumstances and the  appellants  establish  that  they  meet  all  of  the
requirements of appendix  FM.  He  reminded  me  that,  notwithstanding  the
second appellant's date of birth, she was a minor the date  of  application,
and argued that paragraph 301 of the  immigration  rules  should  have  been
considered. Mr Mustakin told me that inadequate consideration  is  given  to
the difficulties which would be faced by both appellants if they  return  to
Bangladesh and make an entry for entry clearance from there.

(d)  Mr  Mustakin  told  me  that  the  Judge's  article  8  proportionality
assessment is inadequate, and  that  the  Judge  placed  undue  emphasis  on
section 117B of the 2002 Act. He urged me to set the decision aside.

6. Mr Tarlow candidly accepted that the  decision  is  tainted  by  material
errors of law. He agreed that if an  appellant  meets  the  suitability  and
eligibility requirements of  appendix  FM  there  is  no  need  to  consider
paragraph EX.1 of the immigration rules. He asked me  to  set  the  decision
aside and substitute my own decision. He indicated that he  would  offer  no
resistance to a finding in favour of both appellants.

Analysis

7. At [13] the Judge takes correct guidance in law, reminding  himself  that
he should consider both the date of decision and  carry  out  an  article  8
assessment at the date of hearing. The problem  is  that,  having  voiced  a
correct self-direction, the Judge does not follow  it.  At  [26]  the  Judge
clearly emphasises the date of decision.  At  [28]  the  Judge  sets  out  a
change in circumstances which indicates that at  the  date  of  hearing  the
appellants meet the requirements of the immigration rules.  The  Judge  does
not factor his findings at [28] into his article 8 assessment.  That  is  an
error of law. It is a material error because it is capable of affecting  the
outcome of the appeal.

8. Between [36] and [38] the Judge considers delay. He finds that the  delay
does not tip the balance of proportionality in the appellant's favour.  What
the Judge does not  consider  is  the  change  in  circumstances  (which  he
identifies at [28]) between the date of the original decision and  the  date
of the decision against which the appellants appeal.

9. The appellants appeal against a decision dated 24 January  2018.  On  the
second page of that decision the respondent finds that the  first  appellant
meets the suitability  and  eligibility  requirements  of  appendix  FM.  Mr
Tarlow candidly conceded that the respondent was wrong to refuse  the  first
appellant's application because the respondent quite clearly finds that  the
first appellant, at the date of decision, met the requirements  of  appendix
FM.

10. The unambiguous wording of the respondent's decision does not form  part
of the Judge's article 8  proportionality  assessment.  The  fact  that  the
respondent accepts that  the  first  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of
appendix FM is a crucial part of the article 8 assessment.

11. The Judge's decision is tainted by material errors of law I  set  aside.
There is sufficient material before me to enable me  to  substitute  my  own
decision.

The Facts

12. The first appellant is the mother of the  second  appellant.  The  first
appellant  was  born  on  02/01/1992.  The  second  appellant  was  born  on
25/09/1997. Both appellants are nationals of Bangladesh.

13. The appellants entered the UK on 15 July 2015 with  leave  to  enter  as
tier 1 dependents  valid  until  14  October  2015.  The  first  appellant's
husband was present in the UK as a tier 1 migrant. He is the father  of  the
second appellant.

14. On 18 September 2015 both appellants submitted  applications  for  leave
to remain in the UK. Those applications were refused on  17  December  2015.
The appellants appealed against those decisions  and  a  hearing  was  fixed
before the First-tier Tribunal to take place  on  28  April  2017.  The  day
before that hearing, the respondent withdrew the decision dated 17  December
2015. The respondent reconsidered his position but reached decisions  on  24
January 2018 refusing the applications. It is against those  decisions  that
the appellants appeal.

15. On 27 July 2015 the first appellant's husband  (the  second  appellant's
father) became a British citizen. The first and second appellants live  with
the first appellant's British citizen husband.

16. The first appellant and her husband work and have a combined  income  of
ï¿½22,400 per annum. Both appellants have sat and passed ESOL entry-level A1.

17. The second appellant is now over 18 years of age, but she  continues  to
live with her parents and is wholly dependent upon her parents.  The  second
appellant has not  established  an  independent  life.  Family  life  exists
between both appellants  and  the  first  appellant's  husband.  The  second
appellant's role within the family has not changed since she  was  17  years
of age. The second appellant hopes to go to  University  to  study  nursing.
During her studies she will remain dependent upon her parents.

18. The respondent accepts that the first appellant  meets  the  suitability
and eligibility requirements of appendix FM.

The Immigration Rules

19. The easiest way to consider this case is to look at the decision  letter
dated 24 January 2018.  On  the  second  page  of  that  decision  that  the
respondent  finds  that  the  first  appellant  meets  the  suitability  and
eligibility requirements of appendix FM. The respondent  then  unnecessarily
goes on to consider paragraph EX.1. There is no need to do so. If the  first
appellant meets the eligibility requirements of  appendix  FM  there  is  no
need to consider whether she is exempt from those requirements.

20. The respondent's  decision  was  that  the  first  appellant  meets  the
requirements of appendix FM at the date of decision.

Article 8 ECHR

21. Mr Tarlow conceded that there is no dispute  about  the  facts  in  this
case. On the facts as the Judge found them to  be  family  life  within  the
meaning of article 8 exists for both appellants and the British citizen  who
is the husband of the first appellant and father of  the  second  appellant.
On the facts as I find to be, the second appellant  remains  dependent  upon
her parents and establishes article 8 family life.

22. The second appellant's father is a British citizen who has no  intention
of leaving the UK.  The  first  appellant  meets  the  requirements  of  the
immigration rules.

23. In Hesham Ali (Iraq)  v SSHD   [2016] UKSC 60 it  was  made  clear  that
(even in a deport case) the Rules are not a  complete  code.  Lord  Reed  at
paragraphs 47 to 50 endorsed the structured approach to proportionality  (to
be found in Razgar) and said "what has now become the established method  of
analysis can therefore continue to be followed..." In  Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC
11, Lord Reed (when explaining how  a  court  or  tribunal  should  consider
whether a refusal of leave to remain was compatible  with  Article  8)  made
clear that the critical issue was generally whether, giving  due  weight  to
the strength of the public interest in removal,  the  article  8  claim  was
sufficiently  strong  to  outweigh  it.   There  is  no  suggestion  of  any
threshold to be overcome before proportionality can be fully considered.

24. I have to determine the following separate questions:

     (i) Does family life,  private  life,  home  or  correspondence  exist
    within the meaning of Article 8
    (ii) If so, has the right to respect for this been interfered with
    (iii) If so, was the interference in accordance with the law
    (iv) If so, was the interference in pursuit of one  of  the  legitimate
    aims set out in Article 8(2); and
    (v) If so, is the interference proportionate  to  the  pursuit  of  the
    legitimate aim?

25. Section 117B of the 2002 Act tells me that  immigration  control  is  in
the public interest. In AM  (S  117B)  Malawi  [2015]  UKUT  260  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that an appellant can obtain no positive right to a  grant  of
leave to remain from either s117B (2) or (3), whatever  the  degree  of  his
fluency in English, or the strength of his financial  resources.  In  Forman
(ss 117A-C considerations) [2015] UKUT 00412 (IAC)  it  was  held  that  the
public  interest  in  firm  immigration  control  is  not  diluted  by   the
consideration that a person pursuing a claim under Article 8 ECHR has at  no
time been a financial burden on  the  state  or  is  self-sufficient  or  is
likely to remain so indefinitely.  The  significance  of  these  factors  is
that where they are not present the public interest is fortified.

26. The fact that the first appellant  can  meet  the  requirements  of  the
immigration rules indicates that  the  public  in  interest  in  immigration
control does not carry greater weight than the first appellant's  article  8
family life.

27. The respondent says that the  immigration  rules  are  a  complete  code
governing the proportionality exercise. Applying the respondent's own  code,
the appellant meets  the  requirements,  so  that  the  public  interest  in
immigration control  is  satisfied  and  the  appellants  exclusion  is  not
necessary,

28.  The respondent says that the appellants can return  to  Bangladesh  and
make an application for leave to enter from  there.   In  Chikwamba  (FC)  v
SSHD 2008 UKHL 40, the House of  Lords  said  that  in  deciding  whether  a
general policy of requiring people such as the Appellant to return to  apply
for entry in accordance with the rules of this country  was  legitimate  and
proportionate in a particular case, it was necessary to  consider  what  the
benefits of the policy were.  Whilst acknowledging the deterrent  effect  of
the policy the House of Lords queried the underlying basis of the policy  in
other respects and made it clear that the policy should not be applied in  a
rigid, Kafka-esque manner.  The House of Lords went on to say that it  would
be "comparatively rarely, certainly  in  family  cases  involving  children"
that an Article 8 case should be dismissed on the basis  that  it  would  be
proportionate and more appropriate for the  Appellant  to  apply  for  leave
from abroad.

29.  In R (on the application of Chen) v SSHD (Appendix  FM  -  Chikwamba  -
temporary separation - proportionality) IJR [2015] UKUT 00189 (IAC)  it  was
held that (i) Appendix FM does not include  consideration  of  the  question
whether it would be disproportionate to expect an individual  to  return  to
his home country to make an entry clearance application  to  re-join  family
members in the U.K. There may be cases in which there are no  insurmountable
obstacles to family life being enjoyed outside the U.K. but where  temporary
separation to  enable  an  individual  to  make  an  application  for  entry
clearance may be  disproportionate.  In  all  cases,  it  will  be  for  the
individual to place  before  the  Secretary  of  State  evidence  that  such
temporary  separation  will  interfere  disproportionately  with   protected
rights. It will not be enough to rely solely upon  the  case-law  concerning
Chikwamba v SSHD [2008] UKHL 40. (ii) Lord  Brown  was  not  laying  down  a
legal test when he suggested in Chikwamba that requiring a claimant to  make
an application for entry clearance  would  only  "comparatively  rarely"  be
proportionate in a case involving children.   However, where  a  failure  to
comply in a particular capacity is the only issue so far as  the  Rules  are
concerned, that may well be an insufficient reason  for  refusing  the  case
under Article 8 outside the rules.

30.  In Agyarko [2017] UKSC 10 Lord Reed said again that  if  an  applicant,
even if residing in the UK unlawfully, was otherwise certain to  be  granted
leave to enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the  UK,
then there might be no public interest in his or her removal and that  point
was illustrated by Chikwamba.

31. In this case the respondent says that the second appellant could make a
successful application to return to the UK to  join  her  parents.  Caselaw
tells me  that  the  refusal  of  leave  to  remain  must  therefore  be  a
disproportionate breach of the right to respect for family life. The second
appellant's father is a British  Citizen.  The  second  appellant's  mother
meets the requirements of the Immigration Rules. Family life exists between
the second appellant and her parents. The  decision  must  therefore  be  a
breach of the right to respect for family life.

32. In Mostafa (Article 8 in entry clearance)  [2015]  UKUT  112  (IAC)  the
Tribunal held that the claimant's ability to satisfy the  Immigration  Rules
is not the question to be determined by the  Tribunal,  but  is  capable  of
being a weighty, though not  determinative,  factor  when  deciding  whether
such  refusal  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate   aim   of   enforcing
immigration control.

33.  These appeals succeed on article 8 ECHR (family life) grounds.

Decision

34. The decision of the First-tier  Tribunal  promulgated  on  27  September
2018 is tainted by material errors of law and is set aside.

35. I substitute my own decision

36. The appeals are allowed on article 8 ECHR grounds.
