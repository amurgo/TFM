Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr F. Okeoma, Sponsor
For the Respondent:          Ms C. Johnstone, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born on the 11th September 1985.
    On the 1st August 2012 she applied for entry clearance as the spouse of
    a British citizen present and settled in the UK.


 2. In the three years and five months that have elapsed since  then,   her
    application has been passed from Entry Clearance Officer[1],  to  Entry
    Clearance Manager[2], to First-tier Tribunal[3], to Upper  Tribunal[4],
    to the Court of Appeal[5] and back down again to come before  me.    At
    this stage in proceedings no one doubts that the  Appellant's  marriage
    to her sponsor Mr Okeoma is genuine and subsisting.  Nor is it in issue
    that since the original decision she has given  birth  to  his  British
    child, now living with her in Nigeria. That is a long time to wait, and
    a very long time for a father to be separated  from  his  child  and  a
    husband from his wife.  It is therefore with much regret that I had  to
    inform Mr Okeoma that his wife's appeal could not be allowed.   I  hope
    the reasons why are adequately explained below.



    My Findings

 3. When the Entry Clearance Officer refused the application three  matters
    were in issue. The first, whether  this  is  a  genuine  marriage,  was
    resolved in the Appellant's favour by the First-tier Tribunal and  that
    decision stands. The remaining two under the Immigration Rules were  as
    follows:

              i) Maintenance. The Sponsor's ability to support his wife fell
                 to be assessed with reference  to  paragraph  E-ECP.3.1  of
                 Appendix FM. Under this provision Mr  Okeoma  had  to  show
                 that he earned ï¿½18,600 gross per annum, but importantly had
                 to do so in accordance with the provisions of  paragraph  2
                 of Appendix FM-SE. He had supplied lots of  evidence  about
                 his income: 6 months of wage slips and bank statements were
                 supplied,  along  with  a   letter   from   his   employer.
                 Unfortunately this letter did not, as it  was  required  to
                 do, set out in terms what the Sponsor's gross annual salary
                 was. The application therefore  fell  to  be  refused  with
                 reference to Appendix FM-SE (2)(b).


             ii) English Language . The application for entry clearance  was
                 supported  by  an  IELTS  certificate  which   showed   the
                 Appellant to have achieved an overall band  score  of  6.0,
                 but only 2.0 in Listening. She did not therefore  have  the
                 required standard of English to qualify for entry clearance
                 as a spouse.

 4. In his decision Judge Blum of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  accepted  the
    Entry Clearance Officer's case that the Appellant could not  show  that
    she had met these requirements at the date of decision. He went  on  to
    consider whether refusal of entry clearance would be  an  unjustifiable
    interference with the human rights of the Appellant and Sponsor and  in
    particular their family life  together.   Judge  Blum  made  a  careful
    assessment of all the facts, that this was a genuine  relationship  and
    that the Sponsor  had  originally  been  a  refugee  who  still  feared
    returning to live in Nigeria.   He accepted that the Sponsor  did  earn
    enough money to support his wife and that in  those  circumstances  the
    justification for refusing entry clearance, 'the economic well being of
    the country' was not a matter that attracted great weight.  Taking  all
    those factors into account he allowed  the  appeal  with  reference  to
    Article 8 ECHR.


 5. The Entry Clearance Officer did not accept that decision.  He  appealed
    on the ground that Article  8  should  only  be  applied  in  the  most
    exceptional of cases, since the Rules themselves  reflected  the  right
    balance between the rights of the individual  and  the  rights  of  the
    state. When the case reached the Upper Tribunal,  Judge  Moulden  found
    that Judge Blum had done enough to justify his decision and upheld it.

 6. The Entry Clearance Officer appealed again, this time to the  Court  of
    Appeal. Shortly after the application had  been  lodged  the  Court  of
    Appeal handed down judgement in SS (Congo) and Ors v SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 387, a case which dealt with exactly the same issues. In that  case
    the Court held that government acted reasonably in  setting  a  minimum
    income threshold and that they  were  entitled  to  set  out  lists  of
    'specified evidence' that applicants had to produce before their claims
    about  their  earnings  could  be  accepted.  That  meant  that  if  an
    application failed for some small omission - for instance  the  failure
    of an employer to spell out what the actual earnings were even if these
    were evident from a payslip- the appeal had to fail under the Rules. It
    could only be allowed under Article 8 where  "good  reasons"  could  be
    shown why the particular applicant was entitled  to  more  preferential
    treatment than other wives and husbands applying under the  same  rule.
    Put another way, there had to be some feature of  the  case  which  was
    compelling.  As a result of the  decision  in  SS  (Congo)  those  then
    representing the Appellant properly recognised that  the  decisions  of
    Judge Moulden and Judge Blum could not stand. That  was  because  Judge
    Blum had failed to identify any good reason why the Appellant  in  this
    case should be entitled to entry clearance when she had failed to  meet
    the requirements of the Rule.


 7. The Court of Appeal remitted the matter to the Upper Tribunal for  that
    assessment to be made.   There are  undeniably  factors  in  this  case
    which compel sympathy for the Appellant. She is on her own bringing  up
    the couple's child, Mr Okeoma is here on his own and  although  he  has
    made short visits cannot return to Nigeria on a permanent basis because
    of his protection issues there. Mr Okeoma explained that his wife  does
    speak very good English (this is supported  by  the  IELTS  certificate
    which shows that she achieved a score of 7.0) but made the  mistake  of
    taking a difficult exam on a day that  she  was  feeling  unwell  as  a
    result of her pregnancy.  They have waited a  long  time,  having  been
    caught in the maelstrom of litigation following the introduction of the
    'new rules' and challenges to it.  These factors  do  not,  even  taken
    cumulatively, amount to good  reasons  why  this  Appellant  should  be
    granted entry over other applicants in Nigeria who are seeking entry to
    join their spouses in the UK.

 8. In view of the lengthy history of this appeal the  Respondent  will  no
    doubt endeavour to assess any fresh application as quickly as possible.

    Decisions

 9. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal, insofar as it relates to human
    rights, has been set aside.  The decision of the First-tier Tribunal to
    dismiss the appeal under the immigration rules is upheld.


10. The decision in the appeal is re-made as follows:


    "the appeal is dismissed on human rights grounds".


11. I was not asked to make a direction for anonymity and on  the  facts  I
    see no reason to do so.
