                            DECISION AND REASONS



    Direction Regarding Anonymity -  Rule  14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  Appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify her.  This direction applies both to the  Appellant
    and to the Respondent.  Failure to comply  with  this  direction  could
    lead to contempt of court proceedings.


 1. The Secretary of State, with permission, appeals against the decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Gumsley), who, in a determination
    promulgated on the 15th April 2019, allowed his protection claim in the
    context of the decision made for the appellant's deportation to
    Somalia.


 2. Whilst this is an appeal by the Secretary of State, for ease of
    reference I intend to refer to the parties as they were before the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 3.  The Appellant is a citizen of Somalia. His immigration history is set
    out within the determination at paragraphs 2-3, and in the papers
    before the Tribunal.


The appellant's immigration history:

 4. It can be summarised as follows. The appellant claims to have arrived
    in the United Kingdom on 8 September 1998 using a false passport and
    claimed asylum by post.


 5. On 1st July he was sentenced for an offence of criminal damage.


 6. On 18 October 2000 he was convicted of six offences; offences of theft,
    failing to surrender to custody and dealt with for a breach of a
    conditional discharge and was sentenced to a community order of 100
    hours.

 7. His claim for asylum was refused on 12 January 2001 (see A1 of the
    respondent's bundle). It set out the basis of his claim that he claimed
    to be a member of the Bajuni clan but that the appellant had been
    requested to complete an SEF in December 2000. He failed to complete
    this and therefore the respondent considered that he had not
    established the factual basis of his claim and that displaced minority
    groups would not necessarily face persecution. The decision set out the
    appellant had spent 2 years in Kenya, and he failed to claim asylum
    there. It is recorded that the appellant had not provided sufficient
    evidence to prove his Somali nationality. It is recorded that the
    appellant did not appeal against that decision.

 8. On 1 March 2001 he was convicted of six offences, (obstructing a police
    officer, failing to surrender to custody, theft x 2 and forging a
    document; his community service order was revoked, and he was the
    subject of a 12-month probation order.

 9. On 21 May 2001 he was served with an IS. 151.A notice as an illegal
    entrant but remained in the UK. Another conviction was recorded on the
    17 July 2001 for theft x 2 and failing to surrender to custody.

10. On 21st of January 2002 he was convicted of 2 offences of theft and on
    the 22 February 2002 he was convicted of theft, attempting to pervert
    the course of justice and failing to surrender to custody and was
    sentenced to 3 months imprisonment.


11. On 14th of January 2009 he was dealt with for breaching an earlier
    imposed DTTO and failing to surrender to custody and sentenced to a
    total of eight weeks imprisonment. The appellant was detained under
    immigration powers on 10 February 2009.

12. He remained in the UK without valid leave until 24 April 2009 when he
    made a further asylum application.  The basis of his claim is recorded
    in the decision letter of 5 November 2009 (at C3 of the respondent's
    bundle).

13. He claimed to be a Somali national who was born and had lived in
    Kismayo. He lived with his mother, brother and sister. He did not know
    his father. He no longer knew where his family lived as he had not been
    in contact with them for 11 years. He did not have a job in Somalia but
    did "anything to get by, buying and selling. Things like that." He
    claimed that he had suffered persecution as a Bajuni living in Kismayo
    and on a few occasions was beaten by other clan members when he was in
    his 20s. In 1995 he decided to leave Somalia and was aided by a man who
    helped people from the local area. Paid him US$2000 to take him to
    Kenya. He was provided with a false passport. He stayed in Kenyan for
    two years and supported himself by doing cash in hand jobs. He did not
    claim asylum in Kenya at any point as no one was claiming asylum there.
    He was arrested in Kenya for being Somalian but was able to secure his
    release by bribing officers. In 19 9080 travel from canyon to the UK
    and was supplied with passport by the agent. He did not claim asylum on
    arrival as he was advised not to do so.

14. Linguistic analysis was completed in June 2009 the results of which
    were documented in a report which found that he spoke a variety of
    Swahili not found in Somalia and that he spoke a variety of Swahili
    with certainty that was found in Kenya and that he did not speak any
    Bajuni. The reasons set out in the report and the decision letter, it
    was not accepted that he was a member of a Somali minority clan and was
    believed to be from Kenya.

15. His asylum representations were refused with in country right of appeal
    which for the second time the applicant did not exercise. The appellant
    was released on the 2 December 2009. It is recorded in the letter from
    his representatives at G3 that he was in detention from February 2009
    until December 2009 and was released following an acknowledgement by
    the respondent that the case could not be progressed due to the
    respondent's inability to verify his nationality.

16. On 31st of January 2011 in the Crown Court he was convicted of one
    count of possessing a class A drug (crack cocaine) and one count of
    possessing a controlled drug (class A; crack cocaine) with intention to
    supply and was sentenced to 2 terms of 30 months imprisonment to run
    concurrently. The judges sentencing remarks are set out at E1. The
    appellant was 36 years of age and pleaded guilty to 2 offences; one of
    supplying crack cocaine of three wraps and the other offence of being
    in possession of nine wraps of cocaine for his own misuse. As to the
    circumstances, it was stated that the appellant was running errands for
    other drug dealers, selling quantities of class a drug on the street
    and saw the quantity to a man and had another quantity for his own use.
    The judge took into account that the previous convictions the appellant
    had were not for drug dealing but were for "acquisitive offending to
    fund your drug habit" but found that this was an escalation of gravity
    in terms of his offending because he was not now stealing in order to
    fund his own habit passing on drugs to other people. The judge stated
    that the offences were "not at the highest end of ability but any kind
    of dealing is serious."

17. On 31 March 2011 the appellant was served with a liability for
    deportation questionnaire giving him the opportunity to make
    representations as to why he should not be deported. It is recorded the
    appellant did not respond.

18. On 9 June 2012 he was again detained under immigration powers.

19. On 4 January 2013 he signed a disclaimer and made an occasion via the
    Facilitated Return Scheme ("FRS") to return to Somalia which was
    approved in January but later withdrawn as his nationality had not been
    verified.

20. On 15 April 2013 decision to deport it was made on the basis that the
    Home Office believe that he was a national of Kenya. The deportation
    was signed and served upon the appellant on 18 April 2013, but no
    response was received. He did not appeal that decision.

21. Whilst the appellant claimed that he would apply for asylum for a third
    time, this was not confirmed in writing as requested. The Kenyan
    authorities refused to issue the appellant with a travel document and
    arrangements are made to remove the appellant to Somalia in June 2014.
    However on 5 June 2014 he submitted further asylum representations
    which were treated as an application to revoke the deportation order.
    He further representations were set out in a letter from his legal
    representatives exhibited at G3 of the respondent bundle. The
    representations were intended to comply with pre-action protocol and
    also as fresh representations in accordance with paragraph 353 of HC
    395 and sought cancellation of the removal directions.

22. In those representations it set out that the appellant was a national
    of Somalia and not Kenya, having been born in southern Somalia and
    having remained there during his early childhood. However the age of 12
    or 13 along with his family he moved to Kenya where he stayed until his
    arrival in the UK.

23. On 20 January 2018 he was sent a one-stop warning but no response was
    received, it was followed by a section 72 warning letter and again no
    response was received.


24. On 24 May 2018 he was convicted at the Magistrate's Court of one count
    of damage one count of the use of threatening and abusive insulting
    words or behaviour and was sentenced to a community order with an
    electronic tagging curfew requirement and was fined �85.

25. On 10 July 2018 the deportation order made against the applicant was
    revoked by the Home Office and the notice of decision to deport the
    appellant was made on 15 April 2013 was withdrawn.

26. On 12 July 2018 a new decision to deport was made notifying him that S
    32(5) of the UK Borders Act 2007 placed a duty on the respondent to
    make a deportation order unless he could demonstrate that one or more
    of the exceptions set out in section 33 of that act apply to him. In
    response to that decision, he submitted representations dated 25 July
    2018 setting out why he should not be deported.

27. A signed deportation order against him was made on 11 September 2018
    and a decision to refuse his protection and human rights claim was made
    on 17 September 2018.


The decision letter:

28. The decision letter set out the immigration history as summarised
    above. As regards section 72 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
    Act 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the "NIAA 2002"), the respondent
    set out that the appellant continued presence in the UK constituted a
    danger to the community and that he had committed a particularly
    serious crime. In reaching that conclusion the respondent took into
    account the nature of the offences which were possession and production
    of class a drug with intent to supply in 2011 and that such offences
    were particularly serious due to the harm they cause to society as a
    whole. Furthermore despite his submissions, he continued to commit
    criminal offences in the UK having been convicted on 24 May 2018 of one
    count of damage and public order offence for which he was sentenced to
    community order with the tagging curfew requirement. Consequently his
    protection claim on the grounds it could not satisfy subparagraph 334
    (iv) of the Immigration Rules and the Refugee Convention did not
    prevent his removal from the UK. His claim was therefore certified that
    the presumption of section 72(2) of the NIAA 2002 applied to him.


29. As to the protection claim advanced by the appellant, consideration was
    given to the representations made in 2014 and in July 2018. The basis
    of his claim was that he was a member of the Bajuni clan (a minority
    clan in Somalia) who claim to have arrived on 8 September 1998. He
    feared that if returned to Somalia he would face mistreatment due to
    his ethnicity. It was further asserted that he would be at risk on
    return to Somalia due to the general security situation and that due to
    the humanitarian conditions in Mogadishu that would constitute a breach
    of Article 15 � of the Qualification Directive.

30. It was accepted by the respondent that the appellant was a national of
    Somalia and also that he was from a minority clan in Somalia (the
    Bajuni).


31. When considering risk on return as a member of a minority clan, the
    respondent considered the decision of MOJ & Others (Return to
    Mogadishu) CG [2014] UKUT 00442 and paragraphs (vii)- (xi).

32. The respondent concluded that there was evidence of a Bajuni clan
    presence in Mogadishu and it was considered that he would be able to
    seek assistance from members of his own clan upon return (see CPIN
    Somalia: a majority clan are minority groups in south and central
    Somalia paragraph 7.4.4).

33. Paragraph 9.3.1 of the CPIN evidence the fact that the diaspora
    continue to return to Somalia and the rate of return is expected to
    increase and that people are able to re-establish themselves upon
    return to Somalia (see paragraph 9.3.3).

34. The appellant's own circumstances were taken into account and that in
    his application for asylum in 2009, he stated that he was a Somali
    national who could speak Swahili and English and that both his parents
    were dead. He made reference to an old brother did not provide his
    details or those of any extended family members in Somalia. It was
    noted that he was from a family of traditional fishermen and completed
    both his preliminary and primary education before working as a
    fisherman, a job he continued after the attack on his village in April
    1993. He demonstrated his resourcefulness after discovering his
    father's body by supporting himself both in Kismayo, Lamu and Mombasa
    (Kenya) where he secured employment as a waiter. It was unclear as to
    how he had supported himself during the 20 years in the UK but his
    linguistic skills and previous skills in Somalia would assist him in
    securing a livelihood upon return to Mogadishu or another area of
    Somalia where other members of the clan reside (see paragraph 7.4.1 and
    7.4.2).

35. In summary, it was considered that the appellant had failed to
    establish that:-
         . he was not able to access the economic opportunities that have
           been produced by the economic boom;
         . that he would not have access to clan support in Mogadishu,
         . that he did not have any family or extended family members
           remaining in Somalia might help him to re-establish is life
           there and that he had no real prospect of securing access to a
           life on return;
         . that he would face the prospect of living in circumstances which
           are acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.
         . He had any kind of profile before his departure from Somalia or
           any evidence of such a profile now on return.


36. As to Article 15 ( c) of the qualification directive, the respondent
    made reference to MOJ and others and others at paragraphs 407 (a) to
    (e) and that returning him Somalia would not cause the UK to be in
    breach of Article 15 (c) of the qualification directive.
37. As to internal relocation following return to Mogadishu, it was stated
    that other than the statement in representations of 2014, the appellant
    had not provided any further explanation or independent evidence to
    substantiate the claim that he could not internally relocate. Therefore
    it was considered that he would be able to establish himself in
    Mogadishu on return or another area where the Bajuni are located. He
    would also be able to make an application via the facilitated return
    scheme which would provide him with financial assistance to ease his
    reintegration into life in Somalia.


38. In respect of Articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR, it was not considered that
    on the evidence he demonstrated a real risk of big subjected to
    unlawful killing, or torture or human or degrading treatment upon
    deportation to Somalia. This was because his claim that he could not
    return to Somalia due to his ethnicity, the general country situation
    in Somalia and his inability to internally relocate were not accepted.

39. At paragraphs 62 - 69 the respondent set out the reasons why it was
    considered that he was excluded from humanitarian protection.

40. At paragraphs 71 - 82 the respondent considered Article 8 of the ECHR
    and in accordance with section 117 A-D in part 5A of the NIAA 2002 (as
    inserted by the Immigration Act 2014). The appellant claimed that he
    had establish a substantial private family life over the last 20 years
    but that he had not submitted any evidence in support of his Article 8
    claim.

41. It was considered that his deportation was conducive to the public good
    and in the public interest because he been convicted of an offence for
    which he been sentenced to a period of imprisonment of less than four
    years but at least 12 months and therefore in accordance paragraph 398
    of the immigration rules, the public interest requires deportation
    unless an exception to deportation applied. The appellant had not made
    any submissions in relation to family life or family life with a
    partner and therefore paragraphs 399 (a) and (b) did not apply.

42. As to his private life it was not accepted that he had been lawfully
    resident in the UK for most of his life; this is because he claimed to
    arrive in the UK on 8 September 1998 aged 23 years 11 months and he was
    now aged 43 years 11 months and had never held leave to remain in the
    UK.

43. It was not accepted that he was socially culturally integrated in the
    UK. Whilst he had been in the UK 20 years it was inevitable that he had
    friendships, but no submissions be made to demonstrate that any of the
    relationships were at the level of dependency or emotional attachment
    over the normal ties of friendship. It was considered that his periods
    of imprisonment removed him from society and that the nature of his
    index offence along the fact that he committed a total of 27 offences
    demonstrated a lack of social and cultural integration as well as
    disregard for the immigration rules along with the laws and societal
    norms of behaviour in the UK. There was no evidence that it made a
    significant positive contribution to the local community and has no
    evidence of his current financial independence. Any ties made were made
    when he had uncertain immigration status.

44. It was also not accepted that there were very significant obstacles to
    his integration having spent his childhood up to the age of around 12
    or 13 in Somalia so he would have retained some knowledge of language,
    customs and society to aid his reintegration. He was believed in good
    physical health. His previous history demonstrated that he was able to
    adapt to a life in a new country of which had no prior knowledge of
    both in the UK and in Kenya when he moved there with his family. It was
    unclear if he had any family member still residing in Somalia who
    provide assistance to ease his reintegration there. In the event that
    there were no family or extended family members in Somalia, it was
    considered that he could seek assistance from members of his clan upon
    return and make an application under the facilitated return scheme to
    ease his reintegration. He also spoke English which is a language
    spoken in Somalia and would be able to re-establish is life in Somalia
    and the clan support would be available.

45. The reasons set out at paragraphs 83 - 89, the respondent set out why
    there were not very compelling circumstances in the appellant's case.

46. It was therefore concluded that having considered all the available
    information, the appellant's deportation would not breach the U.K.'s
    obligations under Article 8 of the ECHR.


The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal:

47. On the 29 September 2018 the appellant submitted grounds of appeal
    stating that:-
               1) that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on account
                  of his clan membership as a Bajuni
               2) the respondent failed to consider his claim for asylum
                  made in 1998 on the basis that he was from Somalia, but
                  the respondent sought his deportation to Kenya;
               3) he was not a danger to the community as he had not
                  reoffended in the prison sentence was almost 10 years
                  previously.
               4) The appellant has lived in the UK for 20 years and there
                  will be very significant obstacles to his reintegration to
                  Somalia.


48. The appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Gumsley) on 13
    February 2019. The appellant did not attend and was not represented.
    The respondent was represented by a presenting officer.  This is a
    matter that I will return to in due course.


49. At paragraphs 4 - 8, the FTT J noted that there had been no explanation
    for the appellant's absence and the presenting officer informed the
    judge that the appellant had failed to sign on when he been asked to do
    so in January 2019 and had not been reporting regularly prior to that.
    The judge further noted that until 7 February 2019 the appellant to be
    represented by solicitors but that the representative withdrew and
    notified Tribunal by letter dated 7 February they had no instructions
    and had been unable to contact the appellant. The letter did not
    clarify when he had last been in contact. The judge was therefore
    satisfied that the appellant had been given notice of the hearing and
    applying the procedural rules decided that he would hear the appeal in
    the absence of the appellant.

50. As to the evidence filed on behalf of the appellant, the judge noted at
    paragraph 7 that there was no bundle from the appellant. He recorded
    that the only evidence provided and available to the Tribunal was a
    statement that was relatively short (under cover of letter dated 25th
    of July 2018) and submissions made on his behalf in 2014 and in 2080
    alongside some external evidence provided along with the letter in
    2014.

51. At paragraph 14 the judge also recorded what he described as "a
    concession" made by the presenting officer that the respondent's
    position was that it was submitted that the appellant could be returned
    to and be expected to live in Mogadishu.

52. The findings and analysis of the FTT J are set out at paragraphs 27 -
    49 and summarised at paragraph 50 as follows:
               1) the appellant is not excluded from claiming asylum by
                  virtue of section 72 of the NIA 2002. However, the judge
                  was not satisfied that there was a risk arising from his
                  membership of the Bajuni clan or for any other convention
                  reason and therefore his asylum claim fails, and his
                  appeal was dismissed on that basis.
               2) The appellant is excluded from claiming humanitarian
                  protection by virtue of the relevant provisions of the
                  immigration rules.
               3) Given the circumstances the case and the concession made
                  that it was suggested the appellant could go to anywhere
                  other than Mogadishu, the question of any other internal
                  relocation does not arise.
               4) For the reasons set out, the judge was satisfied that he
                  would be at risk of destitution, inhumane treatment and
                  serious harm if returned to Somalia (Mogadishu), which
                  would be in breach of his Article 3 human rights. His
                  appeal human rights grounds therefore succeed, and it will
                  be in breach of his human rights (Article 3) or him to be
                  returned to Somalia.
               5) Given the findings, the judge concluded that it was
                  unnecessary for him to consider Article 8 claim.


The appeal before the Upper Tribunal:

53. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal that decision and
    permission was granted by the First-tier Tribunal Judge Bird on the
    12th July 2019 as follows:-
         "The respondent seeks permission to appeal against the judge's
         decision on the grounds of the judge failed to give clear reasons
         for allowing the appeal in Article 3 grounds (ground two). It is
         further alleged that in his assessment the judge failed to properly
         apply the guidance given in MOJ and others (grounds 3-7).

         It is arguable that the judge failed to give adequate reasons his
         finding that the appellant would be at risk of destitution,
         inhumane treatment and serious harm (paragraph 50 (iv) despite the
         judge's findings at paragraph 48 that the "information on the
         evidence from him has been limited) as the appellant did not
         attend. The judges failed to engage clearly with the guidance given
         in MOJ. An arguable error of law has been made."

54. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal the Secretary of State was
    represented by Ms Petterson, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer and
    the Appellant by Mr Olufunwa, solicitor instructed on behalf of the
    appellant.


55. Ms Petterson relied upon the written grounds. The argument advanced on
    behalf of the respondent can be summarised as follows. Ground one
    (contained in paragraphs 1 -7) submit that the FTT J materially erred
    in law in his application of the country guidance decision in MOJ and
    others in allowing the appeal on Article 3 grounds:-
               1) The judge failed to give clear reasons as to why the
                  appellant would have no real prospect of securing access
                  to a livelihood upon return to Mogadishu [46] and that the
                  country guidance decision sets out the expectation is that
                  returnees would be able to access the economic boom and
                  that those returning may in fact have an advantage in
                  securing employment. Furthermore, the evidence in MOJ
                  indicated the prevalence of English-language speakers in
                  Mogadishu and an extensive pool of low skilled employment
                  that is referred to in AAW (expert evidence - weight)
                  Somalia [2015] UKUT 673 which the appellant could take
                  advantage of. It was incumbent upon the appellant to
                  demonstrate why he could not take advantage of the
                  economic boom and by failing to attend the hearing he
                  failed to provide cogent reasons as to why a healthy adult
                  male could not access the labour market. The judge
                  materially erred in law by only considering clan
                  affiliation and remittances from abroad.
               2) It is submitted that the judge misunderstood the influence
                  and need of clan membership and that he did not require
                  clan assistance to obtain employment though it may be of
                  some potential utility and that clan support is only one
                  of the considerations identified in MOJ at (xi) but the
                  judge appeared to have treated this issue as
                  determinative.
               3) As a returnee from the West this would not hinder
                  prospects on return as noted in MOJ at paragraph 351 and
                  the decision of AAW( as cited). The appellant would not be
                  at risk on this basis and it was a factor which could
                  assist him in seeking appointment.
               4) It was noted that the appellant in MOJ had been out of
                  Somalia for an excess of 10 years (AAW it was 17 years)
                  but it was found that both have not shown good reason as
                  to why they could not obtain employment at a low level
                  with the enhanced status of being a returnee from the
                  West.
               5) In respect of remittances (paragraph 45) while family
                  members may not be able to support entirely (although this
                  is yet to be determined as the appellant felt attend the
                  hearing) some remittances and the facilitated return
                  scheme (see MOJ para 423 and AAW at para 57), coupled with
                  the ability to work avoided any forced residence in an IDP
                  camp and the judge's findings on this matter are
                  insufficient.


56. Ground 2 submits that the decision of the Court of Appeal in Said v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2016] EWCA Civ 422, found
    that there was no violation of Article 3 by reason only of a person be
    returned to country which for economic reasons cannot provide him with
    basic living standards.


57. In her oral submissions, Ms Petterson submitted that in relation to
    subparagraph 9, the judge failed to identify why the appellant was at
    risk of destitution and unable to make a living. The burden was upon
    the appellant to give cogent reasons as to why he could not access the
    labour market and that clan support was only one of the considerations.
    At paragraph 43 the judge set out that the appellant's home area was
    not Mogadishu and would therefore be returning to an area in which he
    has never lived or had a home and recorded that his last known home
    where his family were last known to be living was Kismayo (see
    paragraph [43]), however at paragraph 44, the judge failed to take into
    account that the appellant would not need clan assistance to obtain
    employment and that clan support was only one factor. At paragraph 45
    the judge sets out the appellant's history. It was submitted that the
    judge fell into error here and that was the burden was upon the
    appellant to demonstrate that he would fall into destitution, the judge
    made the assumption that he would not be able to receive remittances or
    other help from abroad. Thus she submitted had applied the wrong test
    and that the appellant had to make out his case that he would be
    destitute.


58. Mr Olufunwa relied upon the bundle of documents sent undercover of
    letter of 23 September 2019 which included a witness statement from the
    appellant dated 7 September 2019 (post hearing), a skeleton argument
    and information concerning the spent convictions.

59. The skeleton argument sets out that the appellant maintains that he has
    a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason for which he
    claimed asylum on entry in 1998. It goes on to state that the Secretary
    of State's decision was wrong in law and against the weight of the
    evidence and that previously Secretary of State disputed his
    nationality until the Kenyan given government confirmed that he was not
    a Kenyan. As to his offences, it was submitted that the secretary of
    state failed to consider the appellant could not be a danger to the
    community given the prison sentence almost a decade ago and he had not
    reoffended. The offence was not particular serious. The skeleton
    argument goes on to state that internal relocation was not available
    because he could travel safely to another place and that the SSHD had
    not considered his private life and that he had established a
    substantial private and family life in the UK for 20 years. The
    skeleton argument goes on to state that the Secretary of State should
    consider the Supreme Court's judgement in Kiarie and Byndloss. None of
    those submissions in the skeleton argument address the grounds of
    challenge.


60. In his oral submissions Mr Olufunwa gave a summary of the appellants
    background history and that following its arrival in 1998 and his claim
    made for asylum, is claim was refused three years later in 2001 and
    during that time he had no permission to work in a drifted into
    offending. He had also been in detention for periods of time. He
    submitted that he had struggled with his life and drugs which led to
    the 30 months imprisonment which led to the deportation decision where
    the Secretary of State decided to remove him to Kenya even though he
    was a Somalian national. He was kept in detention between 2012 and 2015
    and he had struggled in his existence and was always a penniless. He
    submitted that when he was young he had committed crimes and is now 45
    years of age.

61. It was submitted that the respondent had  not considered his private
    life at all and that he met the exceptions as he was lawfully resident
    in the UK for most of his life and that he was socially and culturally
    integrated in the UK and that there would be very significant obstacles
    to his reintegration.

62. When asked to deal with the challenges raised on behalf of the
    respondent, Mr Olufunwa submitted that for the reasons set out in
    paragraph 50 the appellant succeeded in his claim under Article 3 as
    Mogadishu was not his home town and that there will be problems as a
    result of his clan which was why he had claimed asylum. He submitted
    that he had been lawfully resident in the UK for most of his life and
    that if he had been granted asylum in 1998 he would not be a foreign
    criminal and that he was pushed into petty chronology for survival.
    There would be significant obstacles to his integration to Somalia
    having left 21 years ago and therefore he submitted all the three
    exceptions are made out in his case.

63. As to the judge's decision, he submitted that the decision could not be
    faulted and that the judge was correct concerning the life in Mogadishu
    and that he would have problems there.

64. Mr Olufunwa made reference to the bundle provided and that in relation
    to his offences they were all pretty crimes and were spent convictions
    and that the maximum sentence that can become spent is a 30-month
    prison sentence. Therefore he cannot be deported by virtue of a spent
    conviction. He submitted that he not been to Somalia since 1998 and
    that the judge considered the decision of MOJ at paragraph 39 - 41 of
    his decision. It would be unreasonable to expect him to return to
    Mogadishu.




Decision on error of law:

65. Having carefully considered the competing submissions of the parties in
    the light of the decision of the FtTJ, and the applicable case law I am
    satisfied that the grounds of challenge advanced by the Respondent do
    demonstrate an error of law in the FtTJ's decision. I shall set out my
    reasons for reaching this decision.


66. It is submitted on behalf of the Respondent that the judge failed to
    have regard to the country guidance, MOJ & Others (Return to Mogadishu)
    CG [2014] UKUT.

67. There is no challenge to the assessment of the FtTJ whereby he
    dismissed the appellant's claim for refugee status on account of his
    ethnicity as a Bajuni or risk of indiscriminate violence (Article 15 (
    c) at paragraphs 41-42.  His analysis is consistent with the findings
    in MOJ that a person who is an ordinary citizen would not be at risk on
    return to Mogadishu by reason of absence abroad, the general security
    situation there, from forced recruitment by Al-Shabaab or for any
    reason relating to clan membership.


68. In MOJ, the Upper Tribunal found that there had been durable change in
    Mogadishu, in the sense that the Al-Shabaab withdrawal was complete and
    there was no real prospect of a re-established presence within the city
    and further that the significance of clan membership in Mogadishu has
    changed. At the time of that decision, it was found that there are no
    clan militias in Mogadishu, there was no clan violence and no clan-
    based discriminatory treatment, even for minority clan members. These
    are the findings in 2014 based on evidence from the preceding years,
    which remain binding today, five years later, and whilst the FtTJ made
    reference to evidence in the more up to date CPIN's available, he was
    not satisfied that he would be subjected to violence which has reached
    the required standard for an Article 15 c risk.

69. I was referred to the country guidance head note and set this out below
    for convenience:


      i) The country guidance issues addressed in this determination are not
         identical to those engaged with by the Tribunal in AMM and others
         (conflict; humanitarian crisis; returnees; FGM) Somalia CG [2011]
         UKUT 445.  Therefore, where country guidance has been given by the
         Tribunal in AMM in respect of issues not addressed in this
         determination then the guidance provided by AMM shall continue to
         have effect.


     ii) Generally, a person who is "an ordinary civilian" (i.e. not
         associated with the security forces; any aspect of government or
         official administration or any NGO or showed an overdrawn account
         although father's account international organisation) on returning
         to Mogadishu after a period of absence will face no real risk of
         persecution or risk of harm such as to require protection under
         Article 3 of the ECHR or Article 15� of the Qualification
         Directive. In particular, he will not be at real risk simply on
         account of having lived in a European location for a period of time
         of being viewed with suspicion either by the authorities as a
         possible supporter of Al Shabaab or by Al Shabaab as an apostate or
         someone whose Islamic integrity has been compromised by living in a
         Western country.


    iii) There has been durable change in the sense that the Al Shabaab
         withdrawal from Mogadishu is complete and there is no real prospect
         of a re-established presence within the city. That was not the case
         at the time of the country guidance given by the Tribunal in AMM.


     iv) (iv) The level of civilian casualties, excluding non-military
         casualties that clearly fall within Al Shabaab target groups such
         as politicians, police officers, government officials and those
         associated with NGOs and international organisations, cannot be
         precisely established by the statistical evidence which is
         incomplete and unreliable. However, it is established by the
         evidence considered as a whole that there has been a reduction in
         the level of civilian casualties since 2011, largely due to the
         cessation of confrontational warfare within the city and Al
         Shabaab's resort to asymmetrical warfare on carefully selected
         targets. The present level of casualties does not amount to a
         sufficient risk to ordinary civilians such as to represent an
         Article 15(c) risk.


      v) It is open to an ordinary citizen of Mogadishu to reduce further
         still his personal exposure to the risk of "collateral damage" in
         being caught up in an Al Shabaab attack that was not targeted at
         him by avoiding areas and establishments that are clearly
         identifiable as likely Al Shabaab targets, and it is not
         unreasonable for him to do so.


     vi) There is no real risk of forced recruitment to Al Shabaab for
         civilian citizens of Mogadishu, including for recent returnees from
         the West.


    vii) A person returning to Mogadishu after a period of absence will look
         to his nuclear family, if he has one living in the city, for
         assistance in re-establishing himself and securing a livelihood.
         Although a returnee may also seek assistance from his clan members
         who are not close relatives, such help is only likely to be
         forthcoming for majority clan members, as minority clans may have
         little to offer.


   viii) The significance of clan membership in Mogadishu has changed. Clans
         now provide, potentially, social support mechanisms and assist with
         access to livelihoods, performing less of a protection function
         than previously. There are no clan militias in Mogadishu, no clan
         violence, and no clan based discriminatory treatment, even for
         minority clan members.


     ix) If it is accepted that a person facing a return to Mogadishu after
         a period of absence has no nuclear family or close relatives in the
         city to assist him in re-establishing himself on return, there will
         need to be a careful assessment of all of the circumstances. These
         considerations will include, but are not limited to:


         circumstances in Mogadishu before departure;
         length of absence from Mogadishu;
         family or clan associations to call upon in Mogadishu;
         access to financial resources;
         prospects of securing a livelihood, whether that be employment or
         self-employment;
         availability of remittances from abroad;
         means of support during the time spent in the United Kingdom;
         why his ability to fund the journey to the West no longer enables
         an Appellant to secure financial support on return.


      x) Put another way, it will be for the person facing return to explain
         why he would not be able to access the economic opportunities that
         have been produced by the economic boom, especially as there is
         evidence to the effect that returnees are taking jobs at the
         expense of those who have never been away.


     xi) It will, therefore, only be those with no clan or family support
         who will not be in receipt of remittances from abroad and who have
         no real prospect of securing access to a livelihood on return who
         will face the prospect of living in circumstances falling below
         that which is acceptable in humanitarian protection terms.


    xii) The evidence indicates clearly that it is not simply those who
         originate from Mogadishu that may now generally return to live in
         the city without being subjected to an Article 15� risk or facing a
         real risk of destitution. On the other hand, relocation in
         Mogadishu for a person of a minority clan with no former links to
         the city, no access to funds and no other form of clan, family or
         social support is unlikely to be realistic as, in the absence of
         means to establish a home and some form of ongoing financial
         support there will be a real risk of having no alternative but to
         live in makeshift accommodation within an IDP camp where there is a
         real possibility of having to live in conditions that will fall
         below acceptable humanitarian standards.


70. The evidence before the FtTJ was extremely limited. There was no bundle
    of documents presented on behalf of the appellant and the witness
    statement referred to by the FtTJ of July 2018 and recorded at
    paragraph 15 (ii) provided no factual detail concerning his
    circumstances when in Somalia or his circumstances in the United
    Kingdom thereafter.

71. The appellant's factual background was equally not without its
    problems. The appellant had not given a consistent account concerning
    his background. When he originally claimed asylum in 1998 he failed to
    complete the SEF form and gave no factual detail sufficient for his
    claim to be established (see decision letter 12 January 2001 at A1). Mr
    Olufunwa's submission that he should have been granted asylum in 1998
    cannot succeed in light of the appellant's failure to comply with
    providing evidence as to his circumstances. In 2009, his claim for
    asylum as recorded in the decision letter at C3 was that he had been
    born and lived in Kismayo with his mother, brother and sister and that
    he did not know its father. He made reference to being beaten in
    Kismayo by other clan members when he was in his 20s and 1995 he
    decided to leave. His inability to provide a consistent account was
    highlighted by the respondent at paragraph 28 - 29. In the further
    submissions sent in 2014 recorded at G3, he claimed that he was born in
    southern Somalia and remained there during his early childhood but that
    he moved to Kenya when he was aged 12 or 13. Consequently there is no
    consistent account given by the appellant as to his life in Somalia or
    any account as to events in the United Kingdom. His claim made on
    Article 8 grounds was that he had built up and established a
    "significant private and family life" but no details have ever been
    forthcoming either before the Secretary of State before the Tribunal.

72. The judge did recognise that the evidence was extremely limited and
    recorded that in essence the only evidence concerning the appellant was
    the respondent's acceptance that he was a Somalian citizen, that he was
    from the Bajuni tribe and the concession recorded [14] that Kismayo was
    his home area and whether he could be expected to live in Mogadishu
    (see paragraph 38 for the summary).

73. Given the lack of clear and cogent evidence beyond those basic facts
    and against the background of non-compliance by this appellant in a
    number of significant ways, the FtTJ was required to give clear reasons
    for any findings made bearing in mind that the burden was on the
    appellant to prove his factual background.

74. I accept the submission made by Ms Petterson that the judge did not
    give adequate reasons for finding that he would have no prospects of
    securing access to a livelihood in Somalia. The assessment is made at
    paragraph 44 - 46 and whilst the  judge took into account that the
    appellant had not lived in Somalia since he was 24 years of age
    (although that was contrary to the appellant's account given in 2014),
    the FtTJ did not give weight to a number of factors in this assessment
    as recorded in the decision of MOJ. As to his language ability, given
    his length of residence and his asserted claim to be culturally
    integrated to the UK, his English language ability was a relevant
    consideration. At its highest the judge took into account at [45] that
    the appellant "seems to be able to now speak English." There was no
    assessment as to how that ability to speak English would assist in
    establishing a real prospect of securing access to a livelihood upon
    return to Mogadishu. The prevalence of language speakers there
    alongside the pool of low skilled employment were aspects of the
    analysis which was missing.


75. In addition there was no consideration of the material in MOJ and
    others concerning the expectation that returnees would be able to
    access the economic boom. The Tribunal addressed this point in the CG
    case:

           "It is beyond doubt that there has been huge inward  investment,
           large-scale construction projects and vibrant business activity.
           Land values are  said  to  be  "rocketing"  and  entrepreneurial
           members of the diaspora with access to funding are returning  in
           significant numbers in the confident  expectation  of  launching
           successful business projects. The question to  be  addressed  is
           what, if any, benefit does this deliver for so called  "ordinary
           returnees" who themselves are not wealthy businessmen or  highly
           skilled professionals employed by such people. "


The conclusion reached concerning the view that economic opportunities  were
available only for "the elite", at para 349, was this:

           "This is a view that is not altogether easy to  understand,  and
           we are unable to agree with it. The evidence is  of  substantial
           inward investment in construction projects and of  entrepreneurs
           returning to  Mogadishu  to  invest  in  business  activity.  In
           particular we heard evidence about hotels and restaurants and  a
           resurgence  of  the  hospitality  industry  as  well   as   taxi
           businesses, bus services, drycleaners, electronics stores and so
           on.  The  evidence   speaks   of   construction   projects   and
           improvements  in  the  city's   infrastructure   such   as   the
           installation of some solar powered street lighting. It does not,
           perhaps, need much in the way of  direct  evidence  to  conclude
           that jobs such as working  as  building  labourers,  waiters  or
           drivers or assistants in  retail  outlets  are  unlikely  to  be
           filled by the tiny minority that represents "the elite".


76. In this context, The FtTJ did not have regard to the evidence,
    discussed in MOJ that returnees are said to be taking jobs at the
    expense of long term residents who have never been away, or the
    evidence that many of the unemployed youth of Mogadishu are simply not
    looking for work, being content to live idle lives, while being in
    receipt of support from remittances from abroad, food and other aid
    available and, in some cases, rental income from agricultural land that
    they do not wish to work themselves ( see paragraph 43 of AAW).There
    was no reference in the analysis as to why a healthy male adult would
    not be able to access the labour market. Nor did it take in to account
    the evidence in the decision letter that he had employment in Somalia
    as a fisherman and had also been able to be self- supporting in Kenya
    where he had employment as a waiter and had obtained sufficient
    resources to leave Kenya and obtain entry to the UK ( see paragraph 52
    of the decision letter).


77. The analysis centres upon the need of clan support. At paragraph [44]
    the FtTJ made reference to their being a presence of Bajuni in
    Mogadishu but cited the decision in MOJ that "although people can
    sometimes obtain support from their clan such help is only likely to be
    forthcoming from majority clan members, as minority clans they have
    little to offer." Whilst at paragraph 353 it was stated that "it may be
    that, like other residents of Mogadishu, he would be more likely to
    succeed in accessing a livelihood with the support of a clan or nuclear
    family." But, again, that observation must be read together with the
    sentence that precedes it:
    "For those reasons we do not accept Dr Hoehne's  evidence  that  it  is
    only a tiny elite that derives any benefit from  the  "economic  boom".
    Inevitably, jobs have been created and the evidence discloses no reason
    why a returnee would face discriminatory  obstacles  to  competing  for
    such employment. It may be that, like other residents of Mogadishu,  he
    would be more likely to succeed in  accessing  a  livelihood  with  the
    support of a clan or nuclear family." Therefore being from  a  minority
    clan did not mean that he could not access the economic boom.


78. The FtTJ did not have regard to the evidence, discussed in MOJ that
    returnees are said to be taking jobs at the expense of long term
    residents who have never been away, or the evidence that many of the
    unemployed youth of Mogadishu are simply not looking for work, while
    being in receipt of support from remittances from abroad, food and
    other aid available and, in some cases, rental income from agricultural
    land that they do not wish to work themselves ( see paragraph 43 of
    AAW).


79.  Whilst the FtTJ found that he had no family living in Mogadishu, as
    set out in MOJ and AAW at [64], the absence of that support was not a
    disqualification to access to work.

     80. On the question of whether the FtJ wrongly failed to take into
         account the possibility of financial assistance in terms of return
         packages available, that was an issue raised in the decision letter
         at paragraph 58 ( see  MOJ at [239] and [423]).The FtTJ stated at
         [45] that he would be entitled to assistance from the respondent by
         that it would be "finite." The reference in MOJ is to a grant of up
         to �1,500 for voluntary returnees. This appellant would not be a
         voluntary returnee, based on his immigration history. However in AN
         & SS (Tamils - Colombo - risk?) Sri Lanka CG [2008] UKAIT 00063 it
         was said that a person could not argue destitution in circumstances
         where they refuse to avail themselves of such a grant simply by
         refusing to return voluntarily. This was a further factor which was
         not take into account in the overall assessment and even if it were
         a " finite amount" there was no consideration as to  whether that
         would assist him in the short term and alongside any ability to
         work which could avoid any possible residence in an IDP camp as
         found by the FtTJ at [47].

81. I do not accept the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the
    FtTJ addressed those matters which were relevant to the issue of return
    to Somalia.  And I therefore accept that the submissions made on behalf
    of the respondent that the FtTJ did not provide a full and clear
    analysis concerning risk of return.

82. This brings me to the second ground which relates to the FtTJ's
    conclusion that the appellant would be at risk of inhuman or degrading
    treatment of serious harm therefore allowed the appeal on Article 3
    grounds.




The "Said point":

83. The respondent submits that the FtTJ erred in law in allowing the
    appeal on Article 3 grounds and relies upon the decision of the Court
    of Appeal in Said v SSHD [2016] The decision in  Said has been referred
    to in a number of decisions which include SSHD v MA (Somalia) [2018]
    EWCA Civ 994 and in SSHD v MS (Somalia) [2019] EWCA Civ 1345.The FtTJ
    did not make any reference to the decision in Said or the later
    decision of MA (Somalia). Ms Petterson was aware of the decision of MA
    (Somalia) which was in support of her appeal. Neither advocate
    addressed the decision any further in their submissions before the
    Upper Tribunal.


84. As confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Secretary of State for the Home
    Department v Said [2016] EWCA Civ 442, Article 3 was intended to
    protect persons from violations of their civil and political rights,
    not their social and economic rights. The return of a person who was
    not at risk of harm because of armed conflict or violence would not in
    the case of economic deprivation violate Article 3 unless the
    circumstances were such as those in N v UK [2005] 2 AC 296 (see
    paragraph 34 of MA (Somalia)). The main conclusion on this point in
    Said is at paragraph 18 which states as follows:
    "These cases demonstrate that to succeed in resisting removal on Article
    3 grounds on the basis of suggested poverty or deprivation on return
    which are not the responsibility of the receiving country or others in
    the sense described in para 282 of Sufi and Elmi, whether or not the
    feared deprivation is contributed to by medical condition, the person
    liable to deportation must show circumstances which bring him within the
    approach of the Strasbourg Court in the D and N cases."

85. There is some concern expressed by the Court of Appeal in Said as to
    possible conflation between factors relevant to the assessment of
    internal relocation, humanitarian protection and Article 3 in MOJ,
    which need to be set out in full. The discussion is at paragraphs 26 to
    31 which states as follows:


         "26. Paragraph 407(a) to (e) are directed to the issue that arises
         under Article 15(c) of the Qualification Directive. Sub-paragraphs
         (f) and (g) establish the role of clan membership in today's
         Mogadishu, and the current absence of risk from belonging to a
         minority clan. Sub-paragraph (h) and paragraph 408 are concerned,
         in broad terms, with the ability of a returning Somali national to
         support himself. The conclusion at the end of paragraph 408 raises
         the possibility of a person's circumstances failing below what "is
         acceptable in humanitarian protection terms". It is, with respect,
         unclear whether that is a reference back to the definition of
         "humanitarian protection" arising from Article 15 of the
         Qualification Directive. These factors do not go to inform any
         question under Article 15(c). Nor does it chime with Article 15(b),
         which draws on the language of Article 3 of the Convention, because
         the fact that a person might be returned to very deprived living
         conditions, could not (save in extreme cases) lead to a conclusion
         that removal would violate Article 3.


         ...
         28.  In view of the reference in the paragraph immediately
         preceding para 407 to the UNHCR evidence, the factors in paras
         407(h) and 408 are likely to have been introduced in connection
         with internal flight or internal relocation arguments, which was a
         factor identified in para 1 setting out the scope of the issues
         before UTIAC. Whilst they may have some relevance in a search for
         whether a removal to Somalia would give rise to a violation of
         Article 3 of the Convention, they cannot be understood as a
         surrogate for an examination of the circumstances to determine
         whether such a breach would occur. I am unable to accept that if a
         Somali national were able to bring himself within the rubric of
         para 408, he would have established that his removal to Somalia
         would breach Article 3 of the Convention. Such an approach would be
         inconsistent with the domestic and Convention jurisprudence which
         at para 34 UTIAC expressly understood itself to be following.
         29.  Having set out its guidance, UTIAC then turned to consider
         IDPs, about which each of the experts had given some evidence. It
         recognised that the label was problematic because there were
         individuals who are considered as internally displaced persons who
         have settled in a new part of Somalia in "a reasonable standard of
         accommodation" and with access to food, remittances from abroad or
         an independent livelihood. UTIAC considered that the position would
         be different for someone obliged to live in an IDP camp, the
         conditions of some of which "are appalling", para 411. It continued
         by quoting from evidence of armed attacks on IDP camps, of sexual
         and other gender-based violence and the forcible recruitment of
         internally displaced children into violence, albeit that it did not
         accept the evidence it quoted. UTIAC also mentioned overcrowding,
         poor health conditions and (ironically) that the economic
         improvements in Mogadishu were leading to evictions from IDP camps
         in urban centres with vulnerable victims being unable to seek
         refuge elsewhere.
         30.  It is immediately apparent that the discussion of this
         evidence, which is culled from expert reports, understandably
         touches on concerns about violence, which in Article 3 terms would
         be analysed by reference to the approach in MSS and Sufi and Elmi
         cases, and aspects of destitution, which would be analysed by
         reference to the approach in the N and D cases. The conflation
         continues in para 412:
             "Given what we have seen, and described above, about the
             extremely harsh living conditions, and the risk of being
             subjected to a range of human rights abuses, such a person is
             likely to found to be living at a level that falls below
             acceptable humanitarian standards."

         Having further discussed the contradictory evidence about how many
         people lived in IDP camps, UTIAC concluded that "many thousands of
         people are reduced to living in circumstances of destitution"
         albeit that there was no reliable figure of how many people lived
         in such destitution in IDP camps. The determination continued:

             "420. Whilst it is likely that those who do find themselves
             living in inadequate makeshift accommodation in an IDP camp
             will be experiencing adverse living conditions such as to
             engage the protection of Article 3 of the ECHR, we do not see
             that it gives rise to an enhanced Article 15� risk since there
             is an insufficient nexus with the indiscriminate violence
             which, in any event, we have found not to be at such a high
             level that all civilians face a real risk of suffering serious
             harm. Nor does the evidence support the claim that there is an
             enhanced risk of forced recruitment to Al Shabaab for those in
             the IDP camps or that such a person is more likely to be
             caught up in an Al Shabaab attack ...

             421. Other than those with no alternative to living in
             makeshift accommodation in an IDP camp, the humanitarian
             position in Mogadishu has continued to improve since the
             country guidance in AMM was published. The famine is confined
             to history ... The "economic boom" has generated more
             opportunity for employment and ... self-employment. For many
             returnees' remittances will be important ...
             422. The fact that we have rejected the view that there is a
             real risk of persecution or serious harm or ill treatment to
             civilian returnees in Mogadishu does not mean that no Somali
             national can succeed in a refugee or humanitarian protection
             or Article 3 claim. Each case will fall to be decided on its
             own facts. As we have observed, there will need to be a
             careful assessment of all the circumstances of a particular
             individual."
         31.  I entirely accept that some of the observations made in the
         course of the discussion of IDP camps may be taken to suggest that
         if a returning Somali national can show that he is likely to end up
         having to establish himself in an IDP camp, that would be
         sufficient to engage the protection of Article 3. Yet such a stark
         proposition of cause and effect would be inconsistent with the
         Article 3 jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court and binding
         authority of the domestic courts. In my judgement the position is
         accurately stated in para 422. That draws a proper distinction
         between humanitarian protection and Article 3 and recognises that
         the individual circumstances of the person concerned must be
         considered. An appeal to Article 3 which suggests that the person
         concerned would face impoverished conditions of living on removal
         to Somalia should, as the Strasbourg Court indicated in Sufi and
         Elmi at para 292, be viewed by reference to the test in the N case.
         Impoverished conditions which were the direct result of violent
         activities may be viewed differently as would cases where the risk
         suggested is of direct violence itself."

86. The question of whether the risk of deprivation on return would lead to
    a violation of Article 3 of the ECHR was considered in MA (Somalia).
    The Court of Appeal consider that it was bound by the decision in Said,
    and confirmed that there is no violation of Article 3 by reason of a
    person being returned to a country which for economic reasons could not
    provide him with basic living standards.


87. It had been advanced in MA that the situation in Somalia was brought
    about by conflict, which is recognised by the European Court of Human
    Rights as an exception to the analysis. The Court however concluded at
    paragraphs 63 -64 that:-
         "63. The analysis in Said, by which this Court is bound, is that
         there is no violation of Article 3 by reason only of a person being
         returned to a country which for economic reasons cannot provide him
         with basic living standards. Mr Sills however contends that that
         situation is brought about by conflict, which is recognised by the
         European Court of Human Rights as an exception to this analysis.

    It is true that there has historically been severe conflict in Somalia,
    but, on the basis of MOJ, that would not necessarily be the cause of
    deprivation if the respondent were returned to Somalia now. The
    evidence is that there is no present reason why a person, with support
    from his family and/or prospects of employment, should face
    unacceptable living standards".

88. It is well established that in Article 3 cases where the risk to the
    individual is not from treatment emanating from intentionally inflicted
    acts of the public authorities in the receiving state or from those of
    non-State bodies in that country when the authorities there are unable
    to afford him appropriate protection; it is only in very exceptional
    circumstances that there would be a violation of Article 3. The
    principles are summarised by the European Court of Human Rights in N  (
    see paragraphs 42-44).


89. In the decision of  The Secretary of State for the Home Department v MS
    (Somalia [2019 EWCA Civ 1435, Hamblen LJ made observations between [73]
    and [76] of his judgment as to the correct approach to be taken to
    consideration of whether Article 3 is made out in respect of the
    particular risk, and the guidance given by the Upper Tribunal in its
    country guidance decision in MOJ.

90. At paragraph 73-74, Hamblen LJ made reference to headnote (xi) which
    sets out paragraph 408 of the decision in MOJ and that paragraph 408
    referred back to the matters set out in paragraph 407h. At paragraph
    75, Hamblen LJ made reference to the decision in Said that the court
    disapproved of paragraph 408 of the guidance insofar as it purported to
    establish the circumstances which removed Somalia would infringe
    Article 3. On the facts of the decision before the court, it was
    determined that the FTT by relying upon applying paragraph 408 in
    determining whether there will be a breach of Article 3, accordingly
    applied the wrong legal test.

91. As set out above, the Court of Appeal in Said, MA (Somalia) and MS
    (Somalia).
     confirmed that the test to be applied in relation to Article 3 in
    cases such as the present, is that set out in N, such that it is only
    in very exceptional circumstances that there would be a violation of
    Article 3 and there would be no such violation by reason of a person
    being returned to a country which for economic reasons cannot provide
    him with basic living standards.

92. When looking at the decision of the FtTJ in the present appeal it seems
    to be the position that he allowed the appeal on the basis that the
    appellant he would not be able to secure any livelihood on return and
    would therefore be a risk of destitution, inhuman treatment and serious
    harm. This is confirmed at paragraph 50 (iv) in his concluding
    paragraph. Accordingly the FtTJ did not apply the correct legal test.


93.  I do not ignore the point in Said that factors in paragraphs 407(h)
    and a 408 of MOJ may have some relevance to an assessment of Article 3,
    but in light of the error having been established in Ground 1, it has
    been demonstrated on the factual assessment that he could not meet the
    high threshold established in N for a breach of Article 3, or in the
    alternative to show that relocation to Mogadishu would be unreasonable
    or unduly harsh.

94. I am therefore satisfied that the decision of the FTT J did involve the
    making of an error on a point of law and the decision is set aside.


95. I am required to consider how the decision should be remade. In this
    respect I should refer to the position of his legal representatives. Mr
    Olufunwa has previously represented the appellant. At the hearing
    before the FtT it was recorded that the appellant had been represented
    until "7 February 2019... however, his representative withdrew and
    notified the Tribunal by letter that day that they had done so, as they
    had no instructions had been unable to contact the appellant." However
    before this Tribunal Mr Olufunwa stated that he had not withdrawn from
    representing the appellant and has therefore not been re-instructed. He
    stated that he had been on record as acting for him throughout the
    process save that he was not on record on the day of the hearing. He
    stated the next time he had contact with him was when he called one of
    his friends and the appellant contacted him immediately after the
    hearing. He said that he had received an email from the appellant
    sending him the determination. He made reference to having written to
    the respondent on 31 July 2019 to confirm that he was still
    representing the appellant but that this was ignored. However it does
    appear that no confirmation was sent to the Tribunal directly and
    throughout the proceedings since the re-promulgation of the decision in
    April 2019, the appellant has been noted as having "no representative."




96. The position has therefore been clarified by his legal representative
    that he remains instructed on behalf of the appellant and remains in
    contact with him which explains the witness statement in the bundle
    dated 7 September 2019. In those circumstances, and given the nature of
    the appeal, I consider that the appeal should be remitted to the First-
    tier Tribunal where further fact-finding and analysis will be
    undertaken at that hearing with the appearance of the appellant who has
    legal representation. As he continues to be legally represented, there
    would be nothing to prevent a full witness state being prepared and his
    attendance at the hearing. Further argument will also include the
    issues raised in relation to Article 3. As the FtTJ allowed the appeal
    on Article 3 grounds he did not consider Article 8, and that also
    remains outstanding.


97. I have given careful consideration to the Joint Practice Statement of
    the First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal concerning the disposal of
    appeals in this Tribunal. That reads as follows:
    "[7.2] The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed to
    re-make the decision, instead of remitting the case to the First-tier
    Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:-
    (a) the effect of the error has been to deprive a party before the
    First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
    party's case to be put to and considered by the First-tier Tribunal; or
    (b) the nature or extent of any judicial fact finding which is
    necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made is such
    that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2, it is
    appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal."


98. Thus, I have reached the conclusion that it is appropriate to remit  it
    to the First-tier Tribunal for a fresh decision on all matters.



Notice of Decision



99. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    on a point of law and is therefore set aside.  It is  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.
