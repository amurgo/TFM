Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr S McTaggart, instructed by Andrew Russell & Co
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Mathews, Senior Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of Zambia where  he  currently  resides  and
    where he was born in 1994.  He came to  the  United  Kingdom  with  his
    mother in December 2005 where she has worked as  a  nurse.   They  were
    granted settled status on 9 November 2010.


 2. On 7 February 2013 the appellant was  convicted  at  Downpatrick  Crown
    Court of causing death by dangerous driving for which he was  sentenced
    to a custodial sentence of five years and ten months, with half  to  be
    served on licence.


 3. On 10 September 2015 the Secretary of State made a deportation order as
    she was required to pursuant to section 52(5) of  the  UK  Borders  Act
    2007.  The Secretary of State  also  certified  the  appellant's  human
    rights case under section  94B  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 which resulted in the  appellant  only  being  able  to
    bring his appeal once he had left the United  Kingdom.   The  appellant
    chose not to give evidence  by  video-link  but  relied  instead  on  a
    written  statement.   The  judge  however  heard  evidence   from   the
    appellant's mother. His factual conclusions were set out in  paragraphs
    48 to 50 of his decision.


 4. The case put by the appellant was that he first lived  with  his  uncle
    and now with his aunt in Zambia where he feels very much  an  outsider.
    He finds life difficult because his qualifications were not  recognised
    and the process of endeavouring to convert them is expensive and bogged
    down by bureaucracy.  Because he does not know anyone, he is  not  able
    to get employment and is in limbo.  He is able to keep contact with his
    mother and fianc�e through WhatsApp.  They visited him in 2017.


 5. The judge's application of his findings of fact to the law was  focused
    on Part 5A of the 2002 Act.  He explained at paras [51] to [53]:


         "51. Exception 1 (4) (c) requires "very significant obstacles"  and
             that denotes a high threshold.  Life in  Zambia  may  be  less
             congenial than County Down but the evidence does not permit  a
             finding that  he  is  facing  very  significant  obstacles  to
             integration.  She said, "he is coping, he is trying to cope."


         52.  For these reasons I find  the  appellant  does  not  meet  the
             provisions of Exception 1 which apply to a medium offender.


         53.  In the case of a serious offender, being  the  appellant,  the
             public interest requires deportation  unless  there  are  very
             compelling circumstances - over and above - those described in
             Exceptions 1 and 2."


 6. After making a further reference to NA (Pakistan) v  SSHD  [2016]  EWCA
    Civ 662 (it had been earlier referred to in his  decision),  the  judge
    explained at paragraph 56:


         "56. Mr McTaggart at paragraphs 6 to 13 of  his  skeleton  argument
             identifies  what  he   considers   to   be   very   compelling
             circumstances but the assessment of the matters he  identifies
             only come into play, if they come into play at  all,  when  he
             can satisfy the Exception 1 provisions.  Furthermore,  even  a
             bare  compliance  with  Exception  1  per  Jackson  LJ  in  NA
             (Pakistan) does not permit a description of the  situation  as
             amounting to very compelling circumstances."


 7. In respect of the appellant's fianc�e,  the  judge  explained  at  para
    [57]:


         "57. I have considered the evidence  of  Ms  Tremers.   I  have  no
             reason to doubt anything  she  says.   The  relationship  only
             began after the deportation order had issued and which had the
             effect of cancelling the appellant's ILR in the UK.  Whilst it
             is unfortunate that the couple have not been able  to  conduct
             their relationship in the way they wish to  do  so  I  am  not
             persuaded  a  boyfriend/girlfriend  relationship  of  some  24
             months duration and developed  in  these  circumstances  is  a
             matter of great weight in the assessment."


 8. The grounds of challenge are succinctly argue errors by  the  judge  at
    [56] and [53] to [58] and assert a misinterpretation of the caselaw.


 9. At the hearing before me, Mr McTaggart argued that  with  reference  to
    para [56], the judge had imposed an additional  burden  which  rendered
    the decision unlawful.  Mr  Mathews  submitted  that  the  relationship
    between the appellant and his partner had  developed  in  January  2016
    after the Secretary of State's decision but the judge had  nevertheless
    taken it into account.  He contended that the judge  had  made  careful
    findings based on exception 1 as to the appellant's  private  life  and
    had taken his integration (in Northern Ireland) into account.  What was
    left was not a great deal  and  it  did  not  come  anywhere  near  the
    threshold the appellant was required to meet. It was open to the  judge
    to consider the case on  an  initial  basis  under  the  exceptions  in
    section 117C and having regard to all the relevant factors  capable  of
    being relied on over and above the exceptions this was not a case  that
    could have succeeded.  By way of response, Mr McTaggart pointed to  his
    submissions before the FtT in which it was acknowledged the  exceptions
    in s.117C could not be made out.  The judge had misdirected himself  as
    to the law and failed to apply all the relevant  factors;  this  was  a
    case that could have gone either way.


10. Neither party had any additional submissions to make in the event  that
    I set aside the decision other than Mr  Mathews  reiterating  that  the
    case did not come anywhere near the threshold.  Mr  McTaggart  accepted
    that no application had been made under rule 15(2A) in relation to  new
    evidence that had been provided to him only recently and did  not  seek
    to rely on that.  He explained that the appellant and his  partner  had
    now recently married in Lusaka.


11. My reading of para [56] of the decision indicates that before examining
    whether there were  very  compelling  circumstances,  the  judge  first
    considered whether a case was made  out  under  Exception  1.   He  was
    correct  to  do  so  having  regard  to  the  principal  plank  of  the
    appellant's case being private life as enjoined by  Jackson  LJ  in  NA
    (Pakistan) at para [37]:


         "37. In relation to a serious offender, it will often  be  sensible
             first to see whether his case involves  circumstances  of  the
             kind described  in  Exceptions  1  and  2,  both  because  the
             circumstances so described set  out  particularly  significant
             factors bearing upon respect for private  life  (Exception  1)
             and respect for family life (Exception 2) and because that may
             provide a helpful basis on which an  assessment  can  be  made
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2"  as  is  required
             under section 117C(6).  It will then be necessary to  look  to
             see whether any of the factors falling within Exceptions 1 and
             2 are of  such  force,  whether  by  themselves  or  taken  in
             conjunction with any other relevant factors not covered by the
             circumstances described in Exceptions 1 and 2, as  to  satisfy
             the test in section 117C(6)."


12. Earlier Jackson LJ explained how "very compelling  circumstances"  were
    to be approached in para [28] ff :

         "28. The next question which arises concerns the meaning  of  "very
             compelling circumstances, over and above  those  described  in
             Exceptions 1 and 2".  The new para. 398 uses the same language
             as  section   117C(6).   It   refers   to   "very   compelling
             circumstances, over and above those  described  in  paragraphs
             399 and 399A." Paragraphs 399 and 399A of the 2014 rules refer
             to the same subject matter as Exceptions 1 and  2  in  section
             117C, but they do so in greater detail.


   1. In our view, the reasoning of the  Court  of  Appeal  in  JZ  (Zambia)
      applies to those provisions.  The phrase used in section  117C(6),  in
      para. 398 of the 2014 rules and which we have held is to be read  into
      section  117C(3)  does  not  mean  that  a  foreign  criminal   facing
      deportation is altogether disentitled from seeking to rely on  matters
      falling within the scope of the circumstances described in  Exceptions
      1 and 2 when seeking  to  contend  that  "there  are  very  compelling
      circumstances, over and above those described in Exceptions 1 and  2".
      As we have indicated above, a foreign criminal  is  entitled  to  rely
      upon such matters, but he would need to be able to point  to  features
      of his case of a kind mentioned in Exceptions 1 and 2 (and  in  paras.
      399 or 399A of the  2014  rules),  or  features  falling  outside  the
      circumstances described in  those  Exceptions  and  those  paragraphs,
      which made his claim based on Article 8 especially strong.


   1. In the case of a serious offender who could point to circumstances  in
      his own case which could be said to correspond  to  the  circumstances
      described in Exceptions 1 and 2, but where he could only just  succeed
      in such an  argument,  it  would  not  be  possible  to  describe  his
      situation as involving very compelling circumstances, over  and  above
      those described in Exceptions 1 and 2.  One might describe that  as  a
      bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 or 2.   On  the  other
      hand, if he could point to factors identified in the  descriptions  of
      Exceptions 1 and 2 of an especially compelling kind in support  of  an
      Article 8 claim, going well beyond what would be necessary to make out
      a bare case of the kind described in Exceptions 1 and 2, they could in
      principle constitute "very compelling circumstances,  over  and  above
      those described in Exceptions 1 and 2", whether taken by themselves or
      in conjunction with other factors relevant to application  of  Article
      8.

          2. Any interpretation of the  relevant  phrase  to  exclude  this
             possibility would lead to  violation  of  Article  8  in  some
             cases, which plainly was not Parliament's intention. In  terms
             of relevance and weight for a proportionality  analysis  under
             Article  8,  the  factors  singled  out  for  description   in
             Exceptions 1 and 2 will apply with  greater  or  lesser  force
             depending on the specific facts of a particular case.  To take
             a simple example in relation to  the  requirement  in  section
             117C(4)(a) for Exception 1, the offender in  question  may  be
             someone aged 37 who came to the UK aged 18 and hence satisfies
             that requirement; but his claim under Article 8 is  likely  to
             be very much weaker than the claim of an offender now aged  80
             who came to the UK aged 6 months, who by dint of  those  facts
             satisfies that requirement.  The circumstances in  the  latter
             case might well be highly relevant  to  whether  it  would  be
             disproportionate and a breach  of  Article  8  to  deport  the
             offender, having regard to the guidance given by the ECtHR  in
             Maslov v Austria [2009] INLR 47, and hence highly relevant  to
             whether there are "very  compelling  circumstances,  over  and
             above those described in Exceptions 1 and 2."


13. Where the judge erred in my judgment was  not  to  go  on  to  consider
    whether there were Exception 1 factors of such force in  themselves  or
    considered  with  other  factors  not  captured  by  Exception  1  that
    satisfied the test of "very compelling". This was not an error  of  the
    wrong approach but a failure to complete the exercise required.


14. Mr McTaggart argued that there were factors  that  the  judge  had  not
    taken into account  with  reference  to  his  skeleton  argument  which
    included:


      i) At the time of the index offence the appellant would have been just
         eligible to apply for citizenship.  Such  an  application  if  pre-
         offence would prima facie have been granted.


     ii) The appellant had attended secondary  school  here  and  had  shown
         remorse in many ways by meeting a family of the bereaved,  being  a
         model prisoner and speaking to other young people through  a  group
         called Radar to discourage them from doing similar things.


    iii) The appellant had a good immigration history during  his  formative
         years in the United Kingdom.


     iv) He spoke English fluently and was well integrated into society  and
         would be ready and willing and able to work.


      v) His engagement to a British/Irish national living in the UK.


     vi) The appellant had been unable to  gain  proper  employment  due  to
         difficulties having his qualifications  recognised  in  Zambia  and
         also due to cronyism and corruption that existed there.


    vii) In addition to his fianc�e the  appellant  enjoyed  a  particularly
         close bond with his mother which went beyond normal emotional ties.




15. The findings by the First-tier Tribunal on the facts were as follows:


         "48. There is no diary of events recording what has happened to him
             since returning to Zambia.  There is no photographic  evidence
             to prove his living conditions: the property of his  aunt  and
             uncle.  He produced no evidence to  show  what  steps  he  has
             taken to register any qualifications  he  has.   There  is  no
             evidence  of  educational  or  occupational  opportunities  in
             Zambia and what efforts he has made to undertake such,  or  at
             the very least investigate whatever is available.  There is no
             account of how the substantial sum of �5333 sent by his mother
             in the first six months of this year has been spent.   Neither
             is there any evidence of housing costs or the availability  or
             otherwise of rented accommodation.  There is  no  evidence  of
             the two occasions on which his mother said he was robbed.


         49.  The social background of his mother,  uncles  and  aunt  shows
             they come from a generation of individuals who have been able,
             for the  most  part,  to  access  education  and  occupational
             opportunities in Zambia and I am satisfied they would be  able
             to provide him with mentoring and support and to advise him on
             how they were able to progress.


         50.  I have considered this mother's evidence.  I am afraid  I  did
             not find her evidence straightforward.  Most of what she  said
             I have no difficulty in accepting.  However,  her  explanation
             for his inability to register his qualification  and  the  fee
             allegedly sought was vague.  She is in frequent  contact  with
             him by electronic means and yet there is no solid evidence  of
             what his difficulties are in participating in life  in  Zambia
             on a day to day basis."


16. Earlier in his judgment, the judge took into  account  the  appellant's
    remorse and meeting with his victim's family, and also his low risk  of
    re-offending.  In my judgment he was correct to conclude without  error
    that the appellant was unable to  come  within  Exception  1.   Had  he
    proceeded to complete the task before him, in the light of the findings
    made and the evidence which is not in dispute,  there  are  no  factors
    which fell  for  consideration  under  Exception  1  of  an  especially
    compelling kind in support of an Article 8 claim going well beyond what
    would be necessary to make out a bare case of  the  kind  described  in
    Exception 1.  In the light of the evidence before  the  judge,  had  he
    completed what was required in this case, there was only  one  rational
    answer. Although I am satisfied the judge  erred  in  law,  the  appeal
    could not have succeeded.


17. This appeal is dismissed.
