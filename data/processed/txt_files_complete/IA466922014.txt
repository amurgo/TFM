                            DECISION AND REASONS

The History of the Appeal

1.   The Appellant,  a  citizen  of  the  Philippines,  appealed  against  a
    decision of the Respondent curtailing her leave to remain  in  the  UK,
    which had originally been granted to her  as  a  Tier  4  Student.  Her
    ensuing appeal was heard by Judge Hussain sitting at Hatton Cross on 20
    May 2015.  Both parties were represented.  In a  decision  of  30  May,
    promulgated on 3 June, 2015, the appeal was allowed on Article 8  human
    rights grounds.

2.   Permission to appeal was granted to the Respondent on  17  August  2015
    by Judge Nicholson in the following terms:

         "1.  First-tier Tribunal Judge  Hussain  allowed  this  Appellant's
             appeal against refusal of leave to remain and removal  to  the
             Philippines in a decision promulgated on 3 June 2015.

         2.   The judge found that there was a disproportionate interference
             in the Appellant's private life because of the effect  of  the
             Appellant's removal on Ms  Staines,  who  suffers  from  motor
             neurone disease and who employs the Appellant to care for her.

         3.   The grounds contend that the judge's assessment was flawed  as
             it was open to Ms Staines to employ another carer. The grounds
             also contend that the judge wrongly found that  the  Appellant
             was financially independent because the Appellant was  working
             without a lawful basis to do so.  Finally the grounds  contend
             that Section  117B  of  the  2002  Act  did  not  support  the
             contention that the Appellant's circumstances  outweighed  the
             public interest in effective immigration control.

         4.   There is no arguable merit in relation to the contention  that
             this Appellant was not  financially  independent.   The  judge
             found at paragraph 52 that she had a monthly income of  ï¿½1,000
             and that this was a factor which 'weighed in her favour'.   It
             is arguable that a person reliant on  unlawful  employment  is
             not financially independent for the purposes of Section  117B.
             Moreover, in AM (Section 117B) Malawi [2015]  UKUT  260  (IAC)
             the Tribunal held that an Appellant  can  obtain  no  positive
             right to a grant of leave  to  remain  from  Section  117B(3),
             whatever the strength of her financial resources.

         5.   Permission to appeal is therefore granted on this  ground.   I
             do not refuse permission on the remaining grounds."

3.   The Appellant submitted a lengthy Rule 24 response, prepared by Miss  A
    Walker, of Counsel, who had represented the Appellant at the hearing.

4.   The Appellant attended the error of  law  hearing.   So  did  Mrs  Lynn
    Staines, for whom the Appellant is a carer, accompanied by two  ladies,
    one from the Motor Neurone Disease Association.  The hearing  took  the
    form of submissions, which I have taken into account, together with the
    permission application  and  the  Rule  24  response.   I  reserved  my
    determination.

Determination

5.    The  essence  of  the  permission  application,  summarised  by  Judge
    Nicholson, is  that  Judge  Hussain  did  not  find  the  existence  of
    exceptional circumstances, and should not therefore have  undertaken  a
    freestanding Article 8 proportionality assessment, and,  alternatively,
    that the assessment which was undertaken was flawed.

6.   Judge Hussain stated the burden and standard of proof  (paragraph  44).
    He noted that the Immigration Rules do not provide for people to remain
    in the UK as carers.   He  therefore  concluded  that  the  application
    should be assessed under conventional Article 8  principles  [45].   He
    followed the Razgar paradigm  [46ff].   He  considered  the  degree  of
    dependence of Mrs Staines upon the Appellant  [47],  and  found,  based
    upon authority about the impact of a decision on  third  parties,  that
    Mrs Staines' private life was engaged [48].  He found that her  private
    life was substantial and that interference with  it  would  have  grave
    consequences [46, 50].

7.   The judge considered a number of factors, including  those  in  Section
    117B of the 2002 Act  [51ff].   The  Appellant  was  a  fluent  English
    speaker.  She had a monthly income  which  the  judge  assessed  to  be
    adequate.  This finding is challenged on the basis that it derived from
    unlawful  employment  and  could  not  therefore  establish   financial
    independence.  In any event, though, it was one factor in  the  complex
    of factors.

8.   The judge bore in mind that effective immigration control  was  in  the
    public  interest.  Since  the  Appellant  was  in  the  UK  unlawfully,
    immigration control would normally demand her exclusion [53].  However,
    she was unlikely to have recourse to public funds  and  speaks  English
    fluently [54].   Mrs  Staines  was  substantially  dependent  upon  the
    Appellant, and the semblance of normality in her life was only possible
    because of the care provided by the  Appellant  [55].   The  Respondent
    argued that another carer could be engaged [56].  However, there was no
    evidence  of  the  availability  of  another  24  hour  carer  at   the
    Appellant's rate of remuneration, and  Mrs  Staines'  brother  had  not
    managed to find any [57].  No social services review had been conducted
    [58].  Mrs Staines did not wish to live in a nursing home,  and  having
    to do so would have a very negative  effect  on  her  emotional  health
    [59].  There was medical evidence of the serious health problems of Mrs
    Staines' brother, which prevented him acting as her  carer  [60].   One
    aspect of the public interest is the economic wellbeing of the UK.   If
    Mrs Staines had to go into a nursing home the cost  to  the  state  was
    likely to be much more than it was at present [61].

9.   The case had not been an easy one to decide.  The judge had to  balance
    the need of immigration control to remove people unlawfully in  the  UK
    against any adverse impact on that individual and on others whose lives
    are touched by them.   His  best  judgment  was  that  on  balance  the
    Appellant's  exclusion  from  the   United   Kingdom   would   not   be
    proportionate [62].

10.  In a scenario  not  provided  for  by  the  Immigration  Rules  it  was
    entirely appropriate for  Judge  Hussain  to  undertake  an  Article  8
    proportionality assessment.   The  assessment  took  into  account  the
    factors prescribed by Section 117B of the 2002 Act.  It  addressed  the
    point raised by the Respondent that Article 8 does not confer a  choice
    of care provider and is not a general dispensing power.   Whilst  there
    may be some  merit  in  the  Respondent's  objection  to  the  judicial
    conclusion about financial independence, this is but one factor in  the
    analysis, and does not detract from the conclusion that  the  Appellant
    is  unlikely  to  have  recourse  to  public  funds.   The  Article   8
    proportionality assessment  was  impeccably  conducted,  and  does  not
    disclose any error of law.

Decision

11.  The original decision does not contain an error of law, and is  upheld.



12.  No anonymity direction is made.
