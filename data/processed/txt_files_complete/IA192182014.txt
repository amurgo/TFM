Representation

For the Appellant:     Mr A Morgan, counsel (instructed by Spring
Solicitors)
For the Respondent:    Ms N Willcocks-Briscoe, Senior Home Office
Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria, born  on  20  July  1984.  Her
      appeal against the decision of the respondent refusing her application
      for leave to remain in the UK as the spouse of a  settled  person  was
      dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Abebrese  in  a   decision
      promulgated on 26 May 2015.


   2. On 13 August 2015 the appellant was granted permission  to  appeal  to
      the Upper Tribunal.


   3. At the commencement of the hearing on 10 November 2015, Ms  Willcocks-
      Briscoe raised a preliminary issue. She stated that  it  appears  from
      Home Office records, that  the  appellant  left  the  UK  after  being
      granted permission to appeal.


   4. She accordingly submitted that in accordance with  the  provisions  of
      s.104(4) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002,  an
      appeal under s.82(1) brought by a person while she is in the UK is  to
      be treated as abandoned if the appellant leaves the UK.


   5. Mr Morgan confirmed that the  appellant  had  left  the  UK.  Although
      s.104(4) had been omitted by Schedule 9 of the  Immigration  Act  2014
      from 20 October 2014, that was subject to savings set out in  Articles
      9-11 SI 2014/2771.


   6. Accordingly, Mr  Morgan  accepted  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  has  no
      jurisdiction to hear this appeal.


Notice of Decision

The Tribunal shall send the parties a notice informing them that the  appeal
is treated as abandoned.


      No anonymity direction is made.
