                            DECISION AND REASONS



Introduction and background

 1. These are linked appeals against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Paul ("the judge"), promulgated on 7 November 2019, by  which  he
    dismissed the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's refusals  of
    their human rights claims.

 2. Before the judge the appeals were focused very much on the position  of
    the third Appellant, the daughter of the other two Appellants, who  was
    born in the United Kingdom in  March  2010  and  has  resided  in  this
    country ever since.  At the date of the hearing before  the  judge  she
    had lived here for 9 � years.

 3. The judge directed himself to KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53; [2018] 1 WLR
    5273 and EV (Philippines) [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874,  addressed  the  best
    interests of the third Appellant, and then considered whether it  would
    be reasonable for her to  leave  the  United  Kingdom.   He  ultimately
    concluded that her best interests lay with remaining with  her  parents
    and that given that the parents had no leave to remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom that place of residence should, in all  the  circumstances,  be
    India.  He concluded that it was "entirely reasonable"  for  the  third
    Appellant to be expected to leave the United  Kingdom.   There  was  no
    merit  in  the  Article  8  claims  of  the   other   two   Appellants.
    Accordingly, the appeals were all dismissed.

 4. The grounds of appeal and submissions of Mr Raza at the hearing  before
    me have been concise.  They assert that the judge erred in his approach
    to the issue of whether it would be reasonable for the third  Appellant
    to be expected to leave the United Kingdom.  It is said that the  judge
    had effectively  assumed  that  the  only  place  in  which  the  third
    Appellant could reside with her parents would be in India and that  no,
    or no adequate, significance was attributed to the fact of her  lengthy
    residence in this country.

 5. Mr Melvin urged me to uphold the judge's decision.  He accepted that it
    was relatively brief in its  reasoning,  but  the  judge  had  directed
    himself properly and considered all the relevant evidence.



Decision on error of law

 6. I conclude that the judge has materially erred in law.  In so  doing  I
    essentially agree with the submissions of Mr Raza.  In my  view  it  is
    apparent from the relatively brief consideration given by the judge  to
    the core issues that he  operated  from  the  premise  that  the  third
    Appellant needed to be living with her parents and as the  parents  had
    no leave to remain in this country (what may be described as the  "real
    world" scenario) this was, if  not  decisive,  then  clearly  the  most
    significant factor in assessing the reasonableness  of  expecting  this
    young girl to leave the United Kingdom.

 7. The basis of that premise was, in my judgment, flawed.  The  judge  was
    required to have conducted an overall best interests assessment  and  a
    plainly very significant aspect of that must on any view have been  the
    9 � years' residence in this United Kingdom at the  relevant  point  in
    time. Matters such as family ties in India were no doubt relevant,  but
    the judge essentially focused entirely on what might  await  the  third
    Appellant in India and has overlooked what statute itself (in the  form
    of section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002,
    as amended - "the 2002 Act") has stated to  be  a  significant  factor,
    namely a 7-year residence in this country.  Indeed,  the  judge's  only
    real reference to the third  Appellant's  situation  in  this  country,
    apart from accepting that she was bright and doing well at school,  was
    in a  comment  included  in  parenthesis  in  paragraph  23,  where  he
    concluded that "apart from the dislocation involved by moving from  one
    country to another" there is nothing to suggest that her  interests  or
    future prospects would be significantly adversely affected.

 8. With respect, that is  inadequate,  particularly  when  the  length  of
    residence was not simply just over the 7-year threshold, but some  2  �
    years further on.  In my view, what is said in paragraphs 44 and 49  of
    MA (Pakistan) [2016] EWCA Civ  705  holds  good:  whilst  there  is  no
    statutory presumption, the question of whether "powerful reasons" exist
    in  a  case  involving  a  qualifying  child  recognises  the   obvious
    significance that must be attached to that status.  Here, the judge has
    simply failed to recognise or take account of that significance.

 9. In summary, the judge erred in his assessment of best interests and  in
    consequence then went on to err in respect of  his  assessment  of  the
    reasonableness test under the Immigration Rules, but  more  importantly
    section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.

10. For these reasons I set the judge's decision aside.



Re-making the decision in this case

11. Having given my decision on error of law at the hearing, I invited both
    representatives to make any additional submissions as to the  re-making
    of the decision in this case; it being agreed that there  was  no  need
    for any further written submissions or a resumed hearing.

12. Mr Raza relied on his initial submissions.  In addition, he urged me to
    find that it must be in the third Appellant's best interests  not  only
    to remain with her parents, but also to remain in the  United  Kingdom.
    This was particularly so given the fact that she had now lived in  this
    country for close to 11 years.  Although a child's best interests  were
    not a trump card, in this case they clearly pointed to  the  conclusion
    that it would not be reasonable for the third Appellant  to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.  On this basis, the appeals of  the  first  and  second
    Appellants should succeed.

13. Mr Melvin also relied on his original submissions.  He urged me to take
    account of the first Appellant's  previous  misconduct  in  the  United
    Kingdom (namely two convictions for Battery and one for Sexual Assault,
    together with three Cautions) when assessing the proportionality of the
    third Appellant leaving the United Kingdom.

14. I make the following relevant findings of fact.

15. The first and second Appellants are husband and wife,  and  are  Indian
    nationals.  I find that the second Appellant arrived in United  Kingdom
    on 19 September 2009 with entry clearance as a student, valid until  10
    April 2011.  An extension of leave to remain in the same  category  was
    subsequently  granted,  running  until  7  October  2013.   A   further
    application, this time based on Article 8, was made out of time  on  18
    November 2013.  This application was refused on 11 November 2015.   The
    human rights claim leading to the refusal now under appeal was made  on
    24 March 2017.

16. In light of the above, the second Appellant  has  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom without leave since 7 October 2013.

17. The first Appellant's immigration history is identical to that  of  his
    wife, save that he had been granted leave as her dependent.  He too has
    been in this country without leave since 7 October 2013.  His record is
    further blighted by  the  convictions  referred  to  by  Mr  Melvin  in
    submissions.  I have looked amongst the documentary evidence before  me
    for details of the convictions, but without success.  In any  event,  I
    find as a fact that the first Appellant has been  convicted  twice  for
    Battery and once for Sexual Assault, in respect of which he was  placed
    on the Sex Offenders' Register.  I find that he has also received three
    Cautions for failing to comply with  the  conditions  attached  to  the
    Register.  Neither party has provided any evidence as to the  sentences
    passed in respect of the convictions or the  circumstances  surrounding
    the offences themselves.

18. I find that the third Appellant an Indian national and was born in  the
    United Kingdom on 7 March 2010.  I find that she is currently in Year 6
    at school (the First-tier Tribunal was apparently led to  believe  that
    she was in a year below this - an error  is  disclosed  by  the  school
    report at A58 of the Appellant's bundle).  There is nothing to  suggest
    that the third Appellant is anything other than fully  integrated  into
    school life, and that she  has  established  ties  beyond  her  nuclear
    family unit.  I agree with and adopt the  judge's  description  of  the
    third Appellant as "a bright child who is thriving at a local  school."
    There is no evidence to suggest that  she  suffers  from  any  material
    medical conditions or other developmental or behavioural difficulties.

19. Like the judge, I accept that the first and  second  Appellants  retain
    ties to India, including extensive family connections.  I find that the
    third Appellant went to visit relations there in 2013.

20. I now turn to my analysis and conclusions on the core  issue  in  these
    linked appeals, namely whether it would be  reasonable  to  expect  the
    third Appellant to leave the United Kingdom.

21. Section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act provides as follows:

         "(6) In the case of a person who is not liable to deportation, the
         public interest does not require the person's removal where-

         (a)  the person has a genuine and subsisting parental relationship
         with a qualifying child, and

         (b)  it would not be reasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
         United Kingdom."

22. Section 117B(6) is a free-standing provision and its satisfaction  will
    be determinative of the appeal(s) of the relevant parent(s)  concerned.
    Neither party has suggested  that  the  first  Appellant  is  a  person
    "liable  to  deportation"  and,  notwithstanding  the   fact   of   the
    convictions referred to previously, I am satisfied  that  he  does  not
    fall within this category.  I base this on the absence of any  evidence
    that  any  sentences  imposed  triggered  the   automatic   deportation
    provisions under the UK Borders Act 2007; or tht they bought him within
    the definition of "foreign criminal" under section  117D  of  the  2002
    Act; or that there has been any other action on the Respondent part  to
    indicate that she believes him to be an individual  who  is  unable  to
    rely on section 117B(6).

23. It is plain that the first and second Appellants  have  a  genuine  and
    subsisting parental relationship with their daughter.

24. Taking all relevant circumstances into  account,  I  assess  the  third
    Appellant's best interests  as  lying  very  firmly  indeed  with  both
    remaining as part of a loving family unit with  her  parents  and  also
    remaining  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  country  of  her  birth  and
    continuous residence for the entirety of her life, a period that is now
    reached almost 11 years.  It  is  quite  apparent  that  she  is  fully
    integrated into British society in respect of all aspects that a  child
    of her age is able to participate in.

25. My best interests  assessment  is  a  crucial  aspect  of  the  overall
    reasonableness  evaluation,  but  it  is  not,  in   and   of   itself,
    determinative.

26. I direct myself to the authoritative guidance set out  by  the  Supreme
    Court in KO (Nigeria), at paragraphs 17 to 19, together with subsequent
    well-known cases in respect of which it is unnecessary to cite here.

27. The focus is on the question of  whether  it  would  be  reasonable  to
    expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.  It  is  plain  from  the
    authorities that any previous misconduct on the part  of  a  parent  is
    irrelevant to this assessment.  Thus, Mr Melvin's attempt at urging  me
    to take account of the first Appellant's convictions when assessing the
    reasonableness issue is misplaced.  The criminality would certainly  be
    relevant  to  an  assessment  of  the  proportionality  of  the   first
    Appellant's removal from the United Kingdom, if that were  the  crucial
    issue in these appeals: but it is not.

28. What is relevant is the so-called "real world" scenario  in  which  the
    family unit finds itself.  None of them have leave to  remain  in  this
    country and, all other things being equal, they would  be  expected  to
    return to the country of their nationality.  It is also the  case  that
    the first and second Appellants are  loving  and  capable  parents  who
    would have the support of family members were they to return to  India.
    India does have a functioning education system and there is  no  reason
    to believe that the third Appellant would be  unable  to  access  this,
    albeit not without significant disruption and probable distress on  her
    part.

29.  Against  these  factors  are  what  in  my  judgment  constitute  very
    significant matters.  The best interests in this case are very strongly
    in favour of the third Appellant remaining in the  United  Kingdom  for
    the reasons set out previously.  In addition, the third  Appellant  has
    not only met the  seven-year  threshold  designated  by  Parliament  as
    representing an important milestone in a  child's  life,  but  she  has
    exceeded this by almost 4 years now.  Despite the disruption caused  to
    children's educations by the Covid-19 pandemic, she is at an  important
    stage of her education: Year 6 is the final year of primary school  and
    one in which assessments are to be undertaken and transitions begun for
    the move into secondary education in September 2021.

30. For my part, I regard the observations of Elias LJ in paragraph 44  and
    49 of MA  (Pakistan)  as  sound,  notwithstanding  the  disapproval  of
    another aspect of his judgment by the Supreme Court  in  KO  (Nigeria).
    Put shortly, whilst I do not regard what is said as creating  any  form
    of a statutory presumption, I see no "powerful reasons" as  to  why  it
    can properly be said that the  third  Appellant  should  reasonably  be
    expected to leave the United Kingdom.

31. Whether or not I take the observations of  Elias  LJ  into  account,  I
    conclude that it would not, in all the circumstances, be reasonable  to
    expect this particular child to leave the United Kingdom.

32. It follows from this that the first and second Appellants are  able  to
    satisfy the criteria set out in section 117B(6) of the 2002 Act.   This
    in turn means that their appeals  fall  to  be  allowed  on  Article  8
    grounds.  This then has  the  inevitable  consequence  that  the  third
    Appellant's appeal must also be allowed on Article 8 grounds.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and it is set aside.

I re-make the decision and allow all three appeals on Article 8 grounds.

No anonymity direction is made.

TO THE RESPONDENT

FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make a reduced  fee
award of �70.00 in respect of  each  of  the  appeals,  making  a  total  of
�210.00.  Appellants have succeeded, this is  in  a  significant  way  based
upon the passage of time  since  the  human  rights  claims  were  made  and
refused, with reference to  the  third  Appellant's  best  interests.   This
issue was a matter which required judicial evaluation on appeal.
