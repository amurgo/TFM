                                                                  Respondent



                            DECISION AND REASONS


   1.  The  Appellant  is  a  national  of  Iran  born  in  1981.  He  seeks
      international protection on the grounds that he faces a real  risk  of
      persecution in Iran for reasons of his religious  belief  -  he  is  a
      Muslim who has converted to Christianity.

   2. The Respondent refused protection on the 3rd August 2018  and  on  the
      8th January 2019 the First-tier Tribunal (Judge CJ  Wooley)  dismissed
      the Appellant's appeal. The Appellant now has permission to appeal  to
      the Upper Tribunal.   The hearing of the appeal was originally  listed
      for the 7th June 2019 but was adjourned pending the  country  guidance
      case on Iranian Christians.

   3. The country guidance decision is now  available:  PS  (Christianity  -
      risk) Iran CG [2020] UKUT 00046 (IAC).    The  headnote,  in  material
      part reads:

     3. Decision makers should begin by determining  whether  the  claimant
        has demonstrated that it is reasonably likely that he or she  is  a
        Christian.   If   that   burden   is   discharged   the   following
        considerations apply:

             i) A convert to Christianity seeking to  openly  practice  that
                faith in Iran would face a real risk of persecution.

            ii) If the claimant would in fact conceal his  faith,  decision-
                makers should consider why.  If any part of  the  claimant's
                motivation is a fear of such persecution, the appeal  should
                be allowed.

           iii) If the claimant would choose to conceal his faith purely for
                other reasons (family pressure, social constraints, personal
                preference etc)  then  protection  should  be  refused.  The
                evidence demonstrates that  private  and  solitary  worship,
                within the confines of the home, is possible and  would  not
                in general entail a real risk of persecution.

   4. The First-tier Tribunal in the instant case finds, at its �37-40, that
      the Appellant has genuinely converted to the Christian faith and  that
      he manifests that faith by  engaging  in  collective  worship  in  the
      United Kingdom. The Tribunal goes on at its �48-52 to find that as  an
      'ordinary' Christian the Appellant would  not  face  a  real  risk  of
      persecution in Iran and this underpins its finding  at  �53  that  the
      Appellant concealed his faith in Iran out of "choice".

   5. In my written directions of the 1st April 2020 (sent to parties on the
      9th April 2020) I indicated that I had reviewed the decision  and  the
      grounds of appeal, and had come to this preliminary conclusion:

             "I find the ratio of the First-tier Tribunal  decision  to  be
             prima facie inconsistent with the country guidance given in PS
             (Iran). As an 'ordinary' Christian the Appellant would  be  at
             risk of persecution if he tried to live openly in Iran and his
             'decision' to live discreetly  must  be  re-assessed  in  that
             context."

   6. My directions further indicated that in light of the present  need  to
      take precautions against the spread of Covid-19,  and  the  overriding
      objective  expressed  in  the  Procedure  Rules[1],  I   reached   the
      provisional view  that  it  would  in  this  case  be  appropriate  to
      determine the following questions without a hearing:

        a)  whether  the  making  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
           involved the making of an error of law, and, if so

        b) whether that decision should be set aside; and if so

        c) what would be the appropriate disposal of the appeal.

   7. I sought the response of the parties to all of the above.

   8. I  am  now  in  receipt  of  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
      Department's written submissions dated the 30th April 2020, and of the
      Appellant's undated response, received on  the  7th  May  2020.  I  am
      grateful for both. I note that neither party objects  to  the  matters
      set out at paragraph 6 above being determined on the papers.

Error of Law

   9. In reasoned and unchallenged  findings  between  �37  and  40  of  its
      decision  the  First-tier  Tribunal  finds  that  the  Appellant   has
      genuinely converted to Christianity. It accepts  that  in  the  United
      Kingdom he regularly attends church services and that he  participates
      in other activities organised by members of the congregation  such  as
      volunteering at the food bank. Applying the  country  guidance  in  PS
      (Iran) to these facts I find that  the  question  put  at  �3  of  the
      headnote is answered in the affirmative.

  10. That burden having been discharged the following considerations apply.
      A convert to Christianity seeking to openly  practice  that  faith  in
      Iran would face a real risk of persecution.  If the  Appellant  sought
      to live in Iran as he does in the United Kingdom he would face a  real
      risk of persecution.

  11. The next question to be considered is whether in  fact  the  Appellant
      would seek to conceal his faith if returned to Iran; if he would  then
      it must be determined why. If any part of his motivation is a fear  of
      persecution, applying the principles set down by the Supreme Court  in
      HJ (Iran) (FC) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department  [2010]
      UKSC 31, he is a refugee.

  12. In her written submissions (prepared by Senior Presenting  Officer  Mr
      I. Jarvis) the Secretary of State submits that the First-tier Tribunal
      did ask itself the appropriate HJ questions.   It concluded  that  the
      Appellant had lived discreetly and had managed to buy a bible  from  a
      local shop. He had not indicated any particular  need  to  evangelise.
      It is submitted that these findings of  fact  support  the  conclusion
      that the Appellant's discretion was simply a matter of choice.

  13. I  have  considered  the  findings  and  approach  of  the  First-tier
      Tribunal. I note that  it  appears  to  accept,  at  its  �35-36,  the
      Appellant's evidence that he and his wife  had  become  interested  in
      Christianity whilst living in Iran. They had allowed their  garden  to
      be used by a small group who would come together and read  the  bible.
      They did not come to the attention of the authorities for doing so and
      experienced no difficulties with the security services. This leads the
      First-tier Tribunal to conclude, at its �53, that "the  appellant  and
      his wife have always lived discreetly in Iran as a  matter  of  choice
      and I find that they would continue to do so on return".

  14. I find that in that conclusion at  its  �53  the  First-tier  Tribunal
      erred in law.  I do so for the following reasons.

  15. First, it is clear from  the  decision  overall  that  the  Tribunal's
      assessment  of  the  Appellant's  behaviour  was  underpinned  by  its
      conclusion that 'ordinary' Christians in Iran do not face a real  risk
      of persecution. That conclusion has been shown to be incorrect  by  PS
      (Iran). Had the  Tribunal  made  its  assessment  of  the  Appellant's
      behaviour against the background of the PS findings  -  that  ordinary
      Christians are in fact subject to sustained persecution - it is likely
      that its decision would have been other than it is.

  16. Second, in reaching that finding the First-tier  Tribunal  appears  to
      have overlooked material evidence about why the Appellant and his wife
      behaved as they did. At its own �9 the Tribunal records the evidence:

            "He knew at the time that conversion from Islam  was  punishable
            by death. His wife had been suffering from  depression  but  got
            better the more they talked about Christianity. Two more couples
            were introduced to the gathering. He was extremely  discreet  in
            Iran...."

      Nowhere in its analysis does the Tribunal consider whether the  threat
      of the death penalty might have played a part in why the Appellant was
      "extremely discreet".

  17. Similarly, the First-tier Tribunal  does  not  consider  any  of  this
      evidence from the Appellant's asylum interview:

            "when I was in Iran  I  was  extremely  discreet  and  extremely
            careful that nothing goes wrong. In other  words,  the  security
            was measured" [Q45]

            [in respect of the individual who attended the Appellant's  home
            to discuss Christianity]: "he checked  if  the  place  was  safe
            enough for having conversation" [Q61]

            [how he was advised  by  a  priest]:  "silence  is  better  than
            bloodshed, better than being killed" [Q95]

      The failure to take such pertinent evidence into account amounts to an
      error of law.

  18. Third, the First-tier Tribunal does not appear to weigh in the balance
      its own positive findings about the way that the  Appellant  manifests
      his faith  in  this  country.   The  finding  that  he  is  a  regular
      churchgoer (who also participates in other Christian  activity)  would
      appear to be inconsistent with the finding that  it  is  in  fact  his
      'choice' to simply study the bible or access Christian content in  the
      privacy of his own home.

  19. I am satisfied for the foregoing reasons  that  the  decision  of  the
      First-tier  Tribunal,  insofar  as  it  relates  to  the   Appellant's
      'discretion' is flawed for error of law and must be set aside.

      The Re-Made Decision

  20. The Appellant is a Christian convert and as such  would  face  a  real
      risk of persecution for reasons of  his  religious  belief  should  he
      choose to live 'openly' in Iran: PS (Iran) applied.

  21. In the past he has been discreet  about  his  faith,  and  was  indeed
      advised by a priest to continue to do so, in order to preserve his own
      safety. Having had regard to all of the evidence I am  satisfied  that
      he did not  do  so  because  he  is  content  to  practice  his  faith
      discreetly, like the 'hidden believers' discussed at �121 of  PS,  but
      because, as he explained at his asylum interview and hearing,  he  was
      afraid for his life.  I note that since he arrived in this country  he
      has been participating in collective worship and has openly  expressed
      his faith through attendance at church and  other  activities  of  his
      Christian community.   There is nothing in the evidence before  me  to
      indicate that he would freely choose to alter his form of  worship  in
      the future. Rather all of the evidence points  to  a  quite  different
      conclusion: that if returned to Iran, he would hide his faith, and  he
      would do so because he is afraid of the persecution that would  follow
      if he didn't. Applying  the  fundamental  principles  of  the  refugee
      convention, as set out in HJ (Iran), he is a refugee.



      Decisions

  22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal contains an error of  law  and
      it is set aside.

  23. The appeal is allowed on protection grounds.
