                                                                  Respondent

For the Appellant:     Mr H Ndubuisi, of Drummond Miller, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr M Matthews, Senior Presenting Officer


                         NOTIFICATION OF WITHDRAWAL

This appeal came before us on the issue  whether  there  had  been  a  valid
appeal before  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   In  course  of  submissions,  Mr
Mathews moved to withdraw the respondent's decision dated  25  August  2014,
made on form IS.151A  Part2,  against  which  the  appeal  was  brought  (or
purportedly brought;  we  do  not  now  need  to  decide  that  point).   He
indicated that the respondent would then make decisions on  the  appellant's
human rights claim  and  on  his  application  for  a  residence  card.   Mr
Ndubuisi did not oppose  the  motion.   We  consent  to  withdrawal  of  the
respondent's case under rule 17 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008, Rule 17.
