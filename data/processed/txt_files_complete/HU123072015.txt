Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr I Richards, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

For the Respondent:    Ms C Grubb instructed by Londonium Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The respondent (whom I will refer to as the "claimant") is a citizen of
    Malawi who was born on 18 June 1977.  He arrived in the United  Kingdom
    on 23 December 2004 as a visitor and was subsequently granted leave  to
    remain as  a  spouse  valid  until  30  September  2005.   In  2006  he
    unsuccessfully applied for further leave to remain  as  a  spouse.   In
    2012 he made an application, again unsuccessful, for  leave  to  remain
    based on his human rights.

 2. On 7 August 2015, he made a further application  for  leave  to  remain
    based  upon  his  human  rights,  namely  Art  8  of  the  ECHR.   That
    application was refused on 18 November 2015.

 3. The claimant appealed to the  First-tier  Tribunal.   Judge  Loughridge
    allowed the claimant's appeal under Art 8  of  the  ECHR  and  also  on
    asylum grounds and under Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR.

 4. The Secretary of State sought permission to appeal on  the  basis  that
    the judge had been wrong to allow the  appeal  on  asylum  grounds  and
    under Arts 2 and 3 of the ECHR as these had not been relied upon before
    the judge.  The Secretary of  State  did  not  seek  to  challenge  the
    judge's decision to allow the appeal under Art 8.

 5. On 30 August 2017, the First-tier Tribunal (Judge Kimnell) granted  the
    Secretary of State permission to appeal.

 6. Before me, it was common ground between the  claimant's  representative
    (Ms Grubb) and the Secretary of State's  representative  (Mr  Richards)
    that the judge had been wrong in law to allow the claimant's appeal  on
    asylum grounds and under Arts 2 and 3 which had not been  relied  upon.
    They invited me to set aside the judge's decision and to  re-make  that
    decision allowing the appeal on the basis of Art 8 alone.

 7. The common position adopted before me is clearly  correct.   The  judge
    was mistaken to allow the appeal on asylum grounds and under Arts 2 and
    3 of the ECHR which were not relied upon before him.  The appeal should
    only have been allowed, and as I have pointed out the judge's  decision
    to do so is not challenged, under Art 8 of the ECHR.

 8. Consequently, I conclude that the judge erred in law and  I  set  aside
    his decision.

 9. I re-make the decision allowing the claimant's appeal under  Art  8  of
    the ECHR.

10. The fee award made by Judge Loughridge stands.
