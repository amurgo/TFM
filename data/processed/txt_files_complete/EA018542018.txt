Representation:

For the Appellant:     Ms A Patyna, instructed by UK Immigration Services
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. First-tier Tribunal Judge Beg dismissed the appellant's  appeal
            against a decision of the respondent to refuse her a  residence
            card as a family member of an  EU  national  exercising  Treaty
            Rights, in a decision promulgated on 15th October 2018.


         2. Permission to appeal was granted on the grounds, in brief, that
            the First-tier Tribunal judge although referring to the case of
            Lim [2013] EWCA  Civ  1383,  she  had  failed  to  address  the
            evidence before her, failed to make adequate reasoned  findings
            and had failed to apply the test laid down in Lim.

         3. It is difficult to ascertain in this decision how the judge has
            considered the evidence in the  context  of  the  test  she  is
            required to apply. Her conclusion that although  the  appellant
            lives with the EU national and his wife, it  was  not  credible
            that  she  was  solely  financially  dependent,  upon  them  is
            unsupported by any or any adequate reasoning.

         4. Although there were findings  in  relation  to  various  family
            members it is unclear from the decision  what  relevance  those
            findings were, given the lack of reasoning.

         5. The First-tier Tribunal judge erred in  law  such  that  I  set
            aside the decision to be remade.

         6. The lack of adequate reasoning  in  this  case  necessitates  a
            hearing de novo with no findings preserved. I remit the  appeal
            to the First-tier Tribunal to be afresh.


          Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

     I set aside the decision and remit it to the First-tier Tribunal.
