Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr A Khan instructed by Manchester Associates
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison Senior Home Office Presenting Officer.



                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The appellant appeals with permission against  the  decision  of  the
       First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal.

    2. The respondent, in her Rule 24 response, dated the 30  October  2017,
       confirms she does not oppose the appellant's application and  invites
       the tribunal to determine the appeal fresh on the basis it  is  clear
       section 117B(6) was not addressed by the First-tier Tribunal.

    3. The Upper Tribunal therefore sets aside the decision  of  the  First-
       tier Tribunal.

Discussion


    4. The appellant is a national of Nigeria born on 21 November  1974.  At
       [31] of the decision under challenge the First-tier Tribunal  records
       that the Secretary of State concedes that the appellant and his  wife
       are in a genuine and subsisting relationship, that they  have  a  son
       together, and  that  the  appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting
       relationship with his son. It is also recorded, as conceded, that the
       appellant  has  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with   his
       stepdaughters.

    5. Section 117B(6) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
       states:

           "In the case of a person who is not liable to  deportation,  the
           public interest does not require the person's removal where-

             a)  The  person  has  a   genuine   and   subsisting   parental
                relationship with a qualifying child, and

             b) it would be unreasonable to expect the child  to  leave  the
                United Kingdom.

    6. The appellant's son and his stepdaughters are British citizens. It is
       the appellants evidence that as his wife is in  full-time  employment
       all the children are reliant upon him for their daily care before and
       after school.

    7. The stepdaughters are stated to  be  ten  and  eleven  years  of  age
       respectively and to have lived in the  United  Kingdom  since  birth.
       His son is 3 ï¿½ years old and has also lived in United  Kingdom  since
       birth. None of the children have travelled to or lived in Nigeria.

    8. In Treebhawon and others (section 117B(6)) [2015] UKUT 674  (IAC)  it
       was held that (i) Section 117B (6) is a reflection of the distinction
       which Parliament has chosen to make between persons who are, and  who
       are not, liable to deportation. In  any  case  where  the  conditions
       enshrined in section 117B(6)  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
       Asylum Act 2002 are satisfied, the section  117B(6)  public  interest
       prevails over the public interests identified in  section  117B  (1)-
       (3):  (ii)  Section  117B  (4)  and   (5)   are   not   parliamentary
       prescriptions  of  the  public  interest.  Rather,  they  operate  as
       instructions to courts and tribunals to be applied in cases where the
       balancing  exercise  is  being  conducted  in  order   to   determine
       proportionality under Article 8 ECHR, in cases where  either  of  the
       factors which they identify arises.

    9. By virtue of section 117D a "qualifying child" means a person who  is
       under the age of 18 and who- (a) is a British  citizen,  or  (b)  has
       lived in the United Kingdom for a continuous period of seven years or
       more.  If a child is a qualifying child for the purposes  of  section
       117B of the 2002 Act as amended, the issue will generally be  whether
       it is not reasonable for that child to return.

   10. The IDIs on Family Migration,  Paragraph  11.2.3,  which  deals  with
       British children (August 2015 version) states  that,  save  in  cases
       involving criminality, the decision maker must not take a decision in
       relation to the parent or primary carer of a  British  Citizen  child
       where the effect of that decision would  be  to  force  that  British
       child to leave the EU, regardless of the age of that child.  However,
       it also states that "where a decision to refuse the application would
       require a parent or primary carer to return to a country outside  the
       EU, the case must always be assessed on the basis that  it  would  be
       unreasonable to expect a British Citizen child to leave the  EU  with
       that parent or primary carer". The section goes  on  to  address  the
       grant  of  leave  to  the  parent  indicating  that  it  may  not  be
       appropriate if there is no satisfactory evidence  of  a  genuine  and
       subsisting parental relationship or where the conduct of  the  parent
       or primary carer gives rise to considerations of such  weight  as  to
       justify separation but  none  of  that  gets  round  the  unequivocal
       statement that it would always be unreasonable to  expect  a  British
       child to leave the EU.

   11.  The  countervailing  factors  in  this  case  are  said  to  be  the
       appellant's  poor  immigration  history  which  I  find  is  not  the
       determinative issue.

   12. Having considered the competing arguments, I find that  in  light  of
       the ability of the appellant to satisfy 117B(6)(a) and (b) the appeal
       must be allowed.

Decision

   13. The Immigration Judge materially  erred  in  law.  I  set  aside  the
       decision of the original Immigration Judge. I remake the decision  as
       follows. This appeal is allowed.

  Anonymity.

   14. The First-tier Tribunal did  not  make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
       45(4)(i) of the Asylum and  Immigration  Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
       2005.

       I make no such order pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
       (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
