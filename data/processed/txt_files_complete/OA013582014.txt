                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    1. This is an appeal against the decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Devittie, promulgated on  27  February  2015,  dismissing  an  appeal
       against a decision to refuse the appellant leave to enter the  United
       Kingdom as a partner. FTTJ Kelly granted permission to appeal  on  11
       May 2016.



                          � CROWN COPYRIGHT 2016


 Background

    2. The appellant applied for leave to enter  the  United  Kingdom  as  a
       partner on 4 December 2013. The said application  was  refused  on  7
       January 2014 under paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) with reference to paragraphs
       E-ECP.2.1, 2.6, 2.10 and 4.1.   In  essence,  it  was  said  that  no
       evidence had been provided to show that the sponsor was  a  permanent
       resident of  the  United  Kingdom;  it  was  not  accepted  that  the
       relationship between the parties was genuine and subsisting  or  that
       they intended to live together permanently in the United Kingdom; the
       appellant had not provided her original degree certificate  from  the
       London Metropolitan University and furthermore, the application  fell
       to be refused owing to a failure to meet the income requirements.  On
       the last point, it was said that no final determination had been made
       owing to the Secretary of State's appeal  against  the  (then)  legal
       challenge to the income threshold requirement.

    4. In appealing the ECO's decision, on 16 January  2014,  the  appellant
       argued that the provisions of the Rules were met; that ample evidence
       was before the ECO as to the financial and relationship  requirements
       and that the appellant had submitted her master's degree certificate,
       which was issued by a recognised higher  educational  institution  in
       the United Kingdom.


    5. An Entry Clearance Manager (ECM)  reviewed  the  decision  to  refuse
       entry, however the original decision was maintained.  A  request  was
       made that the tribunal not take  into  consideration  any  additional
       evidence provided at the appeal.

    6. In dismissing the appeal, the FTTJ did not accept that the  appellant
       had adequately addressed all the reasons  for  refusal.  He  remarked
       that it was "common ground" that the financial requirements were  not
       met but accepted that the English language requirement was met.

    Error of law

    7. The grounds  argued,  firstly,  that  the  FTTJ  failed  to  consider
       evidence he was required to, notwithstanding that it  emanated  after
       the date of the ECO's decision. Secondly, it was said that  the  FTTJ
       erred in making a distinction between a current and savings  account,
       which was said to have been an irrelevant consideration. Lastly,  the
       FTTJ was said to have erred in concluding that the funds had not been
       held for 28 days by reference to the last transaction rather than the
       date the bank statement was issued.


    8. FTTJ Kelly granted permission to appeal on all grounds.








    The hearing

    9. Mr Mills addressed me first, having had additional time  to  consider
       the  issues  raised,  as  well  as  the  evidence  submitted  on  the
       appellant's behalf. In essence, he conceded all issues as well as the
       appeal itself and urged me to  set  aside  the  FTTJ's  decision  and
       remake it, by allowing the appeal under the Immigration Rules.

   10.  In  view  of  Mr   Mills'   entirely   appropriate,   evidence-based
       concessions, I had no need to hear further from Mr Ojukotola.

   11. After hearing Mr Mills' submissions, I announced  that  I  had  found
       material errors of law in the FTTJ's decision, much as set out in the
       grounds.

Decision on error of law

   12. The FTTJ  erred  in  failing  to  consider  evidence  of  intervening
       devotion between the application for entry clearance and the hearing,
       DR (Morocco) [2005] UKIAT 00038 considered. Contrary to the  view  of
       the FTTJ, section 85(5) of the  2002  Act  permits  consideration  of
       evidence arising after the date of the decision. In  this  case  that
       evidence included evidence of a pregnancy, a birth and a  substantial
       quantity of communications between the couple. Accordingly  the  FTTJ
       was wrong at [5(iii)] to state that he  had  "difficulty"  with  this
       evidence because it was not submitted with the grounds of appeal. Had
       the FTTJ considered and attached weight to the abundance of  evidence
       before him, it would be hard to imagine he  would  have  reached  the
       same conclusion as to the genuineness of the relationship  concerned.
       I would add that DNA evidence  obtained  after  the  FTTJ's  decision
       further confirms the relationship between the  child,  the  appellant
       and sponsor.

   13. The FTTJ found that the financial requirements were not  met  because
       he was of the view that savings needed  to  be  kept  in  a  specific
       savings account as opposed to a current account where the funds  were
       kept. Mr Mills confirmed that there was no such  requirement  in  the
       Rules, which I note state that only a "personal"  bank  statement  is
       required and that the guidance to  caseworkers  at  7.4.1  (helpfully
       reproduced by Mr Ojkotola) stated  that  savings  could  be  held  in
       either.

   14. Secondly, the FTTJ  rejected  the  evidence  of  savings  because  he
       understood that the statement was dated more than 28 days before  the
       date of application. He reached this conclusion on the basis  of  the
       last transaction date of 31 July 2013, whereas, the  entry  clearance
       application was made on 4 December 2013. The  FTTJ  was  mistaken  in
       this. The bank statement was dated 27 November 2013, well  within  28
       days of the application and showed a balance of  Naira  5,940,704.69,
       which Mr Mills conceded was adequate to  meet  the  income  threshold
       when combined with the sponsor's annual  earnings.  In  this  he  had
       reference to Mr Ojukotola's detailed calculations, which showed  that
       the appellant had to  meet  a  shortfall  of  �32,275  owing  to  the
       sponsor's low income. The total savings shown, in two bank statements
       were �32,873.20.  The  evidence  before  the  FTTJ  showed  that  the
       financial requirements were met and he erred in finding otherwise for
       the reasons he gave.





   15. The decision of the FTTJ is therefore set aside, with  the  exception
       of his finding that the English language requirement was met.

Decision on remaking

   16. I decided, with the agreement of both representatives, to immediately
       remake the decision.

   17. As indicated above, I find that the appellant and sponsor were  in  a
       genuine  and  subsisting  relationship   and   that   the   financial
       requirements were met.

   18. The FTTJ  accepted  that  the  appellant  met  the  English  language
       requirements and this part of his findings was preserved. I also  had
       sight of the sponsor's United Kingdom Residence Permit  showing  that
       he was granted indefinite leave to remain in this country on  2  June
       2010. All the requirements of Appendix FM are met.

   19. The decision of the FTTJ is  set  aside  and  I  substitute  a  fresh
       decision to allow the appeal against the refusal of  the  appellant's
       application under Appendix FM.


 Decision


  1) The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the
     making of an error on a point of law


  2) The decision of the FTTJ to allow the appeal is set aside.

  3) I substitute a fresh decision to allow the appellant's appeal against
     the refusal of her application for entry clearance to the United
     Kingdom as a partner under Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.

 No application for anonymity was made and I could see no reason to make
 such a direction.
