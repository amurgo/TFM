Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Garrod of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   The appellant is a citizen of Pakistan and her  date  of  birth  is  10
    August 1980.  She appealed against the decision of the respondent dated
    13 October 2014 to refuse her leave to remain in the United Kingdom and
    removal by way of directions  under  Section  47  of  the  Immigration,
    Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

2.   The First-tier Tribunal dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  17  July
    2015 and permission to appeal was initially refused by Judge Chohan  on
    11 March 2016 and subsequently granted by Andrew Grubb on 6 April  2016
    stating it  is  arguable  that  the  judge  failed  properly  to  apply
    paragraph 41-SD(e)(iv) which required only one specified document to be
    produced which was either a service contract or a  bank  statement  but
    not both.  He also stated that in considering  paragraph  41-SD(e)(iii)
    but the judge only some of  the  advertising  material  submitted.  The
    permission Judge went on to say that the appellant will have to satisfy
    the Upper Tribunal that what was produced does meet the requirements of
    the Rules.

3.   First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Chohan  gave  the  following  reasons  for
    dismissing the appellant's appeal which I summarise.   He  states  that
    the burden of proving that the decision of the respondent  was  not  in
    accordance with the law rests on the appellant.   He  states  that  the
    business plan submitted by the appellant  is  generic  and  lacking  in
    figures and specific detail and the judge attaches very  little  weight
    to the same.  The respondent noted that the  appellant  had  failed  to
    submit a bank statement in support of her application and the appellant
    in her grounds of appeal states she did not believe she needed to do so
    as she supplied other  information  and  could  have  supplied  a  full
    picture. However, I note in her bundle she has produced an introductory
    letter from the bank rather than the bank statement and the letter does
    not contain her name and this damages her credibility and indicative of
    the fact that she is not actively trading.

4.   The appellant submitted  limited  information  to  show  that  she  was
    actually trading.  She produced one advertisement from Gumtree and  one
    advert from Scoot.  Both adverts postdate 11th July  2014  and  do  not
    include the appellant's name in any event.  The judge found  that  this
    evidence is insufficient to  show  that  the  appellant's  business  is
    actually trading.  The judge further noted that most  of  the  evidence
    the appellant has produced is dated between June and  August  2014  and
    the fact that the appellant has  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  to
    indicate that she has continued to attempt to develop her  business  is
    indicative of the fact that the business is not actively trading.   The
    appellant has produced one contract relating to services which are said
    to be produced to TNA Badminton.com Limited but the contract  is  small
    being ï¿½199 and there is no evidence that showed that  these  fees  were
    said have related to services to be provided within 30 days of  4  July
    2014 having  been  paid.   In  these  circumstances  little  weight  is
    attached to this evidence.

5.   The judge went on to  consider  the  other  evidence  produced  by  the
    appellant which are photocopies of leaflets and  business  cards.   The
    judge found at paragraph 15 that on the totality of  the  evidence  the
    appellant has failed to show that she fulfils the requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules in respect of Tier 1 Entrepreneur Migrant scheme  and
    that she has generated documentation purely in order to attempt to meet
    the bare requirements of the scheme when she is not actively trading in
    her claimed business.

6.   The judge found that

         "The appellant has attempted to utilise the scheme as a  means  of
         taking disguised  employment  and  I  find  it  to  be  lacking  in
         credibility.   I  find  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet   the
         requirements  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and   that   under   the
         Immigration Rules appeal is bound to fail."


7.   The judge considered Article 8 but that was not part of the grounds  of
    appeal.  There is no challenge on that.

8.   The grounds of appeal state that the judge has  erred  in  law  because
    the appellant is required to either  provide  business  contact  or  an
    original bank account in order to demonstrate  that  the  business  was
    trading as mentioned.   It  is  submitted  that  the  Judge  failed  to
    appreciate in paragraph 11 of  his  decision  that  the  appellant  was
    meeting the requirements of trading by not only providing  the  trading
    contract dated 4 July 2014 which contained the duration of the contract
    as mentioned in the heading  of  the  contract  term  and  duration  in
    contrast to the assertion made by the respondent but also she  provided
    a letter from bank showed at pages 37 to 38 of the  appellant's  bundle
    and therefore she met all the requirements  of  the  service  contract.
    The appellant also provided a bank letter.  There  was  no  requirement
    that the bank letter should contain the name of the applicant  and  the
    only requirement being to provide contact with specified information or
    a letter from bank with specified information.  The judge erred in  law
    by expecting that the bank letter should have contained the name of the
    applicant.  The judge found that the appellant  has  submitted  limited
    information that she was actively trading despite the fact that she met
    the requirements by virtue of  the  Immigration  Rules.   She  provided
    advertisement material in the form of extracts from Gumtree  and  Scoot
    advertisements.  The judge has failed to  consider  all  this  material
    before coming to the decision.  The judge has erred  in  law  that  the
    appellant has to provide only one or more of the documents.

9.   At the hearing I heard submissions as to whether there is an  error  of
    law in the decision. Mr Garrod relied on the grounds of appeal and said
    that First-tier Tribunal Judge Chohan makes his findings at  paragraphs
    10 to 16 of his determination.  He pointed out the  appellant's  bundle
    of documents from  paragraph  40  to  44  the  appellant  provided  her
    business plan which was vast  so  only  a  cover  sheet  was  provided,
    extracts from the website, business cards and flyers and all  of  these
    documents complied with the requirements  under  paragraph  41-SD.   He
    submitted that it is impossible to be able to provide the dates of when
    the advert was put in to the website but was there as of  the  date  of
    application which is in fact the date. The  judge  misdirected  himself
    because he failed to appreciate that the appellant only has to  provide
    one  or  more  documents  and  all  the  documents  provided  met   the
    requirements of the Rules.  There was no reason for  the  appellant  to
    have provided both  the  bank  statement  and  the  bank  letter.   The
    respondent was obliged to clarify with  the  appellant  if  she  needed
    further documentation because the appellant has done all  that  she  is
    able to do in providing the documents that she said she would.

10.  Mr Avery on behalf of the respondent said that  the  appellant  has  to
    prove that she was actively and continuously  trading  before  11  July
    2014 and all evidence has to be looked into in that context.   He  said
    that the advertisement from Scoot does not meet the requirements of the
    rules which must show  that  the  appellant  was  continuously  trading
    before 11 July 2014.  The Gumtree advert equally does not show the date
    when it was submitted for publication.  The contract of  business  does
    not show the duration and does not show all the dates as required.  The
    important  thing  to  show  or  demonstrate  is  compliance  with   the
    Immigration Rules which is to demonstrate continuous  trade  before  11
    July 2014. This was not demonstrated with the  contract  which  was  30
    days before 11 July 2014.  That is  the  fundamental  issue  which  the
    judge took into account that he did not believe that the appellant  had
    been trading, which he was entitled to do on the evidence.

11.  Mr Garrod in reply said it is not easy to prove continuous trading  and
    the appellant has given all the documents and obviously dates will  not
    be on flyers or in business cards and adverts.

Findings as to Whether there is an Error of Law in the Decision

12.  The judge found that the appellant does not meet  the  requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules in that she has not  demonstrated  she  has  been
    trading before 4 July 2014 as required.   The  judge  stated  that  the
    appellant has shown limited information to show she has  been  actively
    trading.   The  Rules  are  prescriptive  and  set  out  the  kind   of
    documentation which have to be provided.  Paragraph SD clearly sets out
    the type of documents required. This is providing  specified  documents
    which demonstrate either together or individually, a continuous  period
    of trading commencing 11 July 2014 up to no earlier than  three  months
    before the  date  of  the  application.   Although  the  appellant  has
    provided documents they do not meet the  strict  requirements  of  what
    information they must contain.  The  appellant  provided  adverts  from
    scoot and Gumtree which is one of the required documents but there  are
    no dates to demonstrate when they were submitted for publication.  I do
    not accept that it is impossible to prove continuous trading for  three
    months before 11 July 2014 from the date of the application but if they
    do not contain the relevant information the appellant  cannot  possibly
    have said to have met the requirements of the Immigration  Rules.   The
    First-tier Tribunal Judge found that this was  not  the  case  and  was
    entitled to do so on the evidence.

13.  The judge at paragraph 3 sets out all the evidence  which  demonstrates
    to me that he understood the nature of the evidence before him and  was
    entitled to find that the  appellant  has  not  been  trading  in  this
    country. After having considered all the evidence, the judge came to  a
    sustainable finding on the evidence.  I find that there is no error  of
    law in the determination of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and I  uphold
    the      decision      and      I       dismiss       the       appeal.
