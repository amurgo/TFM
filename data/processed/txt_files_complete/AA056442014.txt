Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Loughran of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Jarvis a Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

      1. Pursuant to Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)
         Rules 2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order preserving  that
         already in force. Unless the Upper  Tribunal  or  a  Court  directs
         otherwise,  no  report  of  these  proceedings  or  any   form   of
         publication thereof  shall  directly  or  indirectly  identify  the
         Appellant. This direction applies to, amongst others, all  parties.
         Any failure to comply  with  this  direction  could  give  rise  to
         contempt of court proceedings.

      2. I do so in order to preserve the anonymity of the Appellant who was
         found by the First-tier Tribunal to have been  a  child  victim  of
         trafficking and sexual exploitation, and who as will be seen I have
         found had been groomed, beaten, and repeatedly raped as a child  by
         a man who was involved in an organised criminal gang, that there is
         a real  risk  that  those  involved  will  seek  to  recover  their
         financial  outlay  from  the  Appellant  should   they   have   the
         opportunity, the Appellant lacks the maturity and  the  ability  to
         stand up to Vietnamese people, he would have no family  support  in
         Vietnam, he would have no shelter or means  of  supporting  himself
         should he internally relocate, and there is a  real  risk  he  will
         once again fall into the hands of traffickers.

Background

      3. The Appellant is a citizen of Vietnam and was born on [ ] 1997.  He
         is currently 18 years old. The Respondent refused  the  Appellant's
         application for asylum on 24 July 2014 when he was 16 years old but
         accepted he was the victim of trafficking. His appeal  against  the
         refusal of  asylum  was  dismissed  by  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
         Youngerwood ("the Judge") following a hearing on 10 September 2014.
         This is an appeal against that decision.

The hearing on 3 November 2015

      4. It was conceded by the Respondent that the Judge had failed to give
         weight to the fact that at the time of the  hearing  the  Appellant
         was 16 years old, and that, as he was also a victim of trafficking,
         there was a failure to  engage  with  the  required  best  interest
         assessment  in  the  appropriate  factual  matrix.  None   of   the
         subsequent findings regarding the  Appellant's  ability  to  safely
         reach his grandmother, avoid Tuan or those  with  whom  he  may  be
         associated, or internally relocate with or without his grandmother,
         were sustainable and were accordingly  fatally  undermined.  I  was
         also satisfied that the "vulnerability" assessment conducted by the
         Judge did not adequately engage with the evidence of the specialist
         foster carer.  This also amounted to a material error of law. I set
         aside the decision and determined to rehear the matter.

Issues Under Appeal and Proceedings


      5. It is for the Appellant to show that there is a real risk  he  will
         be persecuted in Vietnam due to a  ground  that  engages  the  1951
         Geneva Convention relating to the Status  of  Refugees  ("the  1951
         Convention"). He also claims protection under the  1950  Convention
         for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental  Freedoms  ("the
         1950 Convention").  I confirm I have borne in mind the  Asylum  and
         Immigration  (Treatment  of  Claimants,  etc)  Act  2004   and   in
         particular S8.

      6. I was provided with bundles from the parties all of  which  I  have
         read. I heard from the Appellant, [K], and Helen  Fowler  who  were
         all cross-examined. I summarise here what I consider to be the most
         relevant parts of the evidence for the purpose of his appeal.   The
         fact that I have not included every word stated  or  repeated  does
         not mean that I have excluded it from my consideration.

The Appellant's evidence

      7. In his pre-appointment questionnaire (23 August 2013) the Appellant
         (who was then 15) said  that  according  to  his  grandmother,  his
         mother was here. His family home is in Que Lam Town, Hai Phng City,
         in North Vietnam. There are paddy fields and  a  market.  His  main
         carer was his grandmother who was the only person he lived with. He
         does not know her phone number.

      8. In his screening interview (23 August 2013) he added that  he  flew
         to Bangkok in Thailand and then came here hidden  in  the  back  of
         lorries with 6 (later clarified as 5) people to  whom  he  was  not
         related. Tuan arranged his trip. They met through  mutual  friends.
         He was told he was going on holiday to Thailand. He did not know he
         was coming here. He was told someone would get him a job  here.  He
         heard Vietnamese people say he had  been  trafficked  here.  If  he
         returns, Tuan would demand money from him and try  to  traffic  him
         out of the country again. Tuan travelled with him to  Thailand  and
         said just get  into  the  vehicle  and  they  will  meet  when  the
         Appellant arrived. Tuan obtained the travel  document  to  get  the
         Appellant from Vietnam to Thailand.

      9. In his statement (1 October 2013 when he was almost  16)  he  added
         that he went to school in Vietnam from the age  of  6  to  13.  His
         parents separated and left when he was very young.  He  lives  with
         his maternal grandmother. He has not spoken to her  since  he  left
         Vietnam. He met Tuan when he was 15. Tuan was  21  or  22.  He  was
         impressed by Tuan who treated him well. He went to  Bangkok  as  he
         was excited to travel. He used a false passport  and  was  given  a
         phone on the plane. They were picked up in a  car.  Tuan  was  with
         him. He was driven to a car park and ordered to get into  a  lorry.
         He was told to ring Tuan when he reached his destination. He was in
         the lorry for a few weeks. He was arrested when he got out. He  was
         put into foster care with 2 other children who were in  the  lorry.
         He agreed to go with them to their relatives. They were  picked  up
         by 2 men in a car and taken to a train station.  After  the  others
         left he was approached by a Vietnamese man  and  woman  who  helped
         him. He showed them the address of his  foster  carer.  The  couple
         took him to their home and said they would return him to the foster
         carer which they did the next day. If Tuan knew he was here he  may
         force him to grow cannabis or work for them. His grandmother is old
         and cannot protect him. The police will want money to protect  him.
         His grandmother has no money. He will not be able to live away from
         his grandmother as she is his  only  relative.  He  would  have  to
         register with the authorities and give a reason why he  has  moved.
         Tuan could find him as he would be able to  bribe  the  police.  He
         thinks it was an organised group that brought him here.

     10. In his substantive interview (3 October 2013 his 16th birthday)  he
         added that he has not spoken  to  his  grandmother  since  he  left
         Vietnam. He does not know if he has relatives other than  an  older
         brother he has not seen since his  parents  divorced  when  he  was
         little.

     11. In his statement (undated but prior to  15  April  2014  as  it  is
         referred to by Christine Beddoe - see below [20]) he added that  he
         finds it difficult to talk about what happened in Vietnam. He feels
         scared and ashamed. He was told by Tuan to use his brother's  name.
         Initially he was well treated by Tuan but then Tuan became  violent
         to him and allowed others to be violent as well. He was  forced  to
         have sex with Tuan on many occasions. He would then be nice to him.
         He could not tell the police or his grandmother due to  the  stigma
         and as the police would do  nothing.  This  went  on  for  about  7
         months. Tuan would find him if he  went  home.  He  could  not  get
         protection from his grandmother or the police.

     12. In his statement (10 September 2014 -when he was nearly 17) he said
         he does not know his grandmother's exact age.

     13. In his statement (unsigned but dated 2 December 2015  when  he  was
         18) he added that he attends college 3 days a week. His English has
         improved. He is studying Engineering. He continues to live with the
         foster carers. He does not feel ready to live with another boy  and
         does not want to live alone. It would be very  difficult  to  cook,
         clean, and organise himself. He has tried to stay safe. He would be
         in danger in Vietnam. He would not know how to get food or to live.
         He has had no contact with his grandmother since he  left  as  Tuan
         knows where she lives. He will have to live on the streets with  no
         qualifications. He would find himself in the same situation he  was
         in before. He could be tracked down by Tuan when he registers.

 [K]'s evidence

     14. [K] stated (24 April 2014)  that  she  is  the  Appellant's  foster
         carer. She and her husband have fostered him since  26  June  2013.
         They are specialist foster parents  for  trafficked  children  from
         Barnardo's. They have been specifically  trained  and  have  looked
         after 5 trafficked children since 2010.

     15. The Appellant is not allowed to use  the  internet  to  ensure  the
         traffickers do not trace him. He was not allowed a mobile phone  or
         money. This was done to keep him safe.  He  now  has  a  restricted
         mobile phone and pocket money and can  go  out  for  short  periods
         during which he must check in with them. He is  very  innocent  and
         childlike and at risk of being manipulated. He trusts  people  very
         easily. He is smart in some areas but in other  areas  he  is  very
         vulnerable and needs careful handling. He attends school,  is  good
         at Maths, enjoys swimming, and has developed relationships with her
         family and friendships with other young people they have  fostered.
         He is easily influenced and acts  younger  than  his  chronological
         age.

     16. She added (7 December  2015)  that  the  Appellant  is  still  very
         trusting especially with Vietnamese people and thinks they  can  be
         believed. He will do whatever his Vietnamese friends  want  and  is
         easily led. He  becomes  quiet  and  submissive.  He  resisted  the
         influence of peers in respect of drugs. She has found him jobs.  He
         does not understand  the  implications  of  her  husband's  serious
         health problems and jokes about it. His organisation  is  not  very
         good. He has never understood the seriousness of  his  trafficking,
         how he needs to keep  himself  safe,  or  how  he  deals  with  new
         friends. He is na�ve. It is like teaching a small child.

     17. In evidence she added that without  the  professional  support  the
         Appellant receives, he would struggle. He does  not  plan  for  the
         future. He would not cope  in  Vietnam.  He  does  not  go  against
         Vietnamese adults and is very trusting of  them.  He  now  goes  to
         college alone. So far as she is aware he has not been approached by
         traffickers here. It is still hard to get  him  to  understand  the
         trouble he can get himself into. It has not improved since he  came
         here despite him getting older. He would rather  Vietnamese  people
         think bad of him than stand up to them.

Helen Fowler's Evidence

     18. She wrote (2 December 2015) that she is  the  Appellant's  previous
         Social Worker and a Senior Practitioner in Child Care. She met  him
         regularly and attended professional  meetings.  He  is  polite  and
         pleasant with a good sense of humour. He is a very vulnerable young
         man. He is keen to engage with Vietnamese society and is frustrated
         at the checks that need to be undertaken to ensure he is  safe.  He
         did not understand he was being exploited by working for free in  a
         nail bar in exchange for training as he was told that this was  how
         it was done in Vietnam. The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Team
         (CAMHS) have identified that he is highly likely to be  traumatised
         by the experiences in Vietnam  and  of  being  trafficked.  In  her
         opinion he has  shown  a  level  of  immaturity  in  his  emotional
         development which is due to his  experiences.  His  emotional  well
         being is very fragile. Due to his trusting  nature,  lack  of  self
         confidence, and lack of ability to enforce his basic rights, he  is
         highly vulnerable to exploitation and further experiences of abuse.
         He  has  a  low  stress  threshold  due  to  his  previous  abusive
         experiences and any  additional  pressure  on  him  causes  him  to
         regress and not meet his own basic needs.

     19. In evidence she added that he would struggle with everyday tasks if
         he was removed and did not have the network of support.

Christine Beddoe's evidence

     20.  Christine  Beddoe,  former  director  of  ECPAT   UK   End   Child
         Prostitution, Child Pornography and Child Trafficking, detailed her
         expertise and filed a report (15 April 2014). Between 1999 and 2003
         she spent time working in  Vietnam  advising  government  and  non-
         government agencies on the protection of children and prevention of
         child exploitation. In  2011  as  Director  of  EPCAT  she  visited
         Vietnam to discuss  child  trafficking  with  government  and  non-
         government agencies and consulted  those  agencies  on  the  likely
         scenarios  faced  by  children  and  young  people  who  have  been
         trafficked to the United Kingdom if they were  to  be  returned  to
         Vietnam.

     21. It is noteworthy that adults of Vietnamese  origin  in  the  United
         Kingdom have sought to identify and control him [17 of her report].
         In Vietnamese child trafficking cases there is no such thing  as  a
         benevolent stranger [20] who, without reason, collects a child at a
         station and takes them home. It is usual  that  these  "accidental"
         meetings have been pre-arranged by a third party. It is after  this
         point that the child ends up in some form of exploitation  or  debt
         bondage. This behaviour has been  recently  documented  in  Vietnam
         [36] by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM). It  was
         reported by UNICEF and the Vietnamese government in 2011 that there
         are no specialised support  services  including  shelters  for  boy
         victims [39]. In recent years there has been an increase in reports
         and anecdotal evidence showing that there is trafficking of  males,
         especially boys trafficked internally and also  abroad  for  sexual
         and labour exploitation [40]. Both UNICEF and IOM state that  local
         responses to trafficking for sexual exploitation exclude boys [41].
         The police arrest boys and  girls  if  they  are  suspected  to  be
         involved in sex work [44]. Evidence  suggests  that  discrimination
         and stigma exists against gay men [45]. The stigma of homosexuality
         and HIV Aids and the  conceptualisation  of  prostitution  being  a
         "social evil" in official government policy creates  a  significant
         barrier for children to seek help from authorities  for  fear  that
         their families will reject them and they will be arrested [48].

     22. Human Rights Watch  report  that  a  considerable  number  of  drug
         detention centres also double as detention centres for sex  workers
         [52] and children who have used drugs [51]. The Law on  Prevention,
         Suppression against Human Trafficking (LPSAHT) that took effect  on
         1 January 2012 is not sufficient to  guarantee  a  continuation  of
         support for all returning victims of trafficking because support is
         conditional  and  victims  must  first   comply   with   government
         requirements to co-operate  [54].  Accommodation  support  is  only
         aspirational [56].

     23. Victims face an uphill struggle that increases their  vulnerability
         to re-trafficking. They cannot get identification cards to register
         for permanent residence.  Their  communities  discriminate  against
         them and consider them to be spoiled and unfit for marriage and  as
         having a corrupting influence on other young people. Most  returned
         victims  suffered  from  economic  difficulties,   were   homeless,
         landless, and jobless, and suffered from poverty and famine [71].

     24. There are a number of policies to restrict migration into the major
         cities that are used to determine access to public services in that
         locality for formal sector jobs, education,  health  care,  housing
         and registration for purchasing assets such as houses and  vehicles
         [74]. The risk of exploitation and re-trafficking is extremely high
         if a young person has no attachment and is faced with no option but
         to move from place to place to secure work [75].

     25. Vulnerable Vietnamese children are targeted by  organised  criminal
         networks in Vietnam. The short and long term safety and  protection
         needs of these children are very high due to  the  violent  methods
         used by fragmented criminal networks  to  recoup  financial  outlay
         [81].

     26. The Appellant is the victim of sexual  abuse  and  exploitation  by
         Tuan having been groomed [30] having been  treated  well  and  then
         plied with alcohol and drugs [33] and then ill-treated [34]. He  is
         a vulnerable child requiring high levels of emotional and practical
         support which will not be met if he returns to  Vietnam  increasing
         the risk of re-trafficking either within  Vietnam  or  cross-border
         [66]. He would suffer stigma and if he did not explain why  he  had
         been outside Vietnam he would  be  marginalised  further  [67].  He
         would not be eligible for children specific support and there is no
         appropriate support for young male  victims  of  human  trafficking
         [69].  For  the  Appellant  there  are  no  services  or  intensive
         protection measures, and a withdrawal of the level  of  support  he
         has had would undoubtedly  contribute  to  a  sustained  period  of
         extreme anxiety  and  increase  his  risk  of  re-trafficking.  His
         ability  to  access  legal  advice  or  support  as  a  victim   of
         trafficking in Vietnam would be almost nil [73]. His age  and  lack
         of experience and family network means he would have to  travel  to
         find work [75]. He could have been removed  from  the  registration
         scheme having been absent for more than 6  months  [76]  and  would
         find it difficult to navigate the level of bureaucracy necessary to
         regain it without trusted support which would  leave  him  open  to
         deception, corruption, and exploitation [78].

     27. He is at high risk of being re-trafficked should he be returned  to
         Vietnam. The single most important  risk  factor  is  that  he  has
         already  been  trafficked  and  sexually  exploited  and   multiple
         vulnerabilities  flow  from  that  point.  There  are  no  specific
         shelters in Vietnam for boys who have been sexually  exploited  and
         trafficked and there  are  no  therapeutic  support  programmes  or
         safeguards in Vietnam for young people in his situation.  He  would
         almost certainly be forced  to  work  with  corrupt  officials  and
         others who would expect to be bribed for keeping  quiet  about  his
         history of abuse. The stigma of men having sex with men would  make
         it untenable to discuss his past  history  with  officials  of  any
         kind, or seek help in the community [86].

Christoph Bluth's evidence

     28. Christoph Bluth is the Professor  on  International  Relations  and
         Security at the University of Bradford. He is a specialist  in  the
         geopolitics of Asia, has studied and taught about Vietnam for  over
         20 years, and recently supervised a Vietnamese  Doctoral  candidate
         who engaged in primary research on his country.

     29. Loan  sharks  often  act  as  migration  brokers  and  are  closely
         connected to trafficking and debt  bondage  [5.2.6].  Children  are
         trafficked for labour exploitation often in cannabis farms [5.2.9].



     30.  It  is  reported  that  upon  return,  their  community  does  not
         sympathise with their experiences but rather discriminates  against
         them and treats them as criminals. Local authorities have  not  yet
         paid attention to them  and  have  not  yet  provided  support  and
         assistance for their reintegration. This  makes  the  victims  more
         vulnerable and increases their risk of being re-trafficked. Victims
         are generally denied household registration. It is  suggested  that
         they are perceived as  different  in  society  and  they  therefore
         constitute  a  particular  social  group   who   share   a   common
         characteristic [5.2.11]. (I note here that  I  have  been  provided
         with the 2012 study  entitled  Repatriation  and  Reintegration  of
         Trafficked Victims: the Case of Vietnam by Le Thi Hoa -  see  below
         [46]). They are likely to be  re-trafficked  as  they  are  usually
         poor, lacking in education, and lack awareness of  trafficking.  He
         has heard that police hand returnees to the trafficker  and  it  is
         likely he would be returned to his grandmother who may be forced to
         have him re-trafficked to pay the perceived debt [5.2.12].

     31. The Appellant would be thrust into a  hostile  environment  without
         the necessary experience to cope with the enormous  challenges  and
         dangers he would have  to  confront.  He  would  compete  for  work
         against peers with established family and  social  networks,  local
         experience, and the ability to distinguish criminal  elements  from
         bona fide  employers  [5.2.15].  Criminals  trafficking  in  "slave
         labour" particularly focus on the countryside to find new  victims.
         Relocation would not eliminate the risk to the Appellant  [5.2.17].
         Law enforcement to deal with trafficking  is  uneven  and  the  law
         enacted in 2012 has not had the implementation  edicts  issued  and
         lacks enforcement penalties [5.3.1]. Trafficking related corruption
         at the  local  level  remains  widespread  [5.3.2].   Shelters  for
         trafficking victims are rudimentary, underfunded, and do  not  have
         appropriately trained staff.  The process for applying  for  a  new
         household registration is no easy task and involves several  phases
         and is time consuming [5.3.6/5.3.8]. Having  one  is  necessary  to
         exercise basic rights. Not having one would expose him to  multiple
         institutionalised vulnerabilities and risks [5.3.7] where he  would
         be unable to access basic government services, and access to health
         care and education [5.3.10].

     32. It is practically inevitable that if returned  he  will  come  into
         contact with loan sharks and there  is  a  risk  he  could  be  re-
         trafficked. There  is  a  high  risk  he  will  be  the  target  of
         trafficking gangs, aided and possibly abetted  by  corrupt  police,
         and there will not be sufficient support to protect him [6.2].

Other Evidence

     33. Gwen Wilkinson is the manager at the KRAN Riverside  Project.  They
         provide non-statutory  English  and  Lifeskills  for  unaccompanied
         asylum seekers and refugees between the ages of 16 and 19 under the
         care of social services. She  wrote  (4  December  2015)  that  the
         Appellant was referred to them in July 2014 and enjoyed the  summer
         programme. He came again in the summer of 2015. It  was  noticeable
         how little progress he had made in his confidence  and  ability  to
         interact  with  peers  and  his  failure   to   realise   his   own
         vulnerabilities  when  engaging  with  visiting  adults.   He   was
         submissive in his interaction with Vietnamese and  mixed  ethnicity
         students. His ability to fend for himself  is  of  a  much  younger
         person. His unfailing trust in  others  could  lead  to  him  being
         exploited and re-trafficked.

     34. Romana Ghorbani is an English Teacher at the Royal Harbour Academy.
         She wrote (5 December 2015) that she  taught  the  Appellant  until
         June 2015. He made very good academic progress. He is very immature
         for his age and needed lots of guidance, almost at a primary school
         level, to help him acquire some basis skills  necessary  for  going
         through his school life successfully.  Progress  in  organisational
         social and  communication  skills  would  not  have  been  possible
         without  very   close   home-school   liaison   links.   He   often
         misunderstood what was expected of him, found it difficult to  meet
         deadlines, and had difficulties with planning ahead.  He  was  also
         very impressionable and had a very na�ve outlook on  life.  He  was
         still a vulnerable young man not ready for the challenges  of  life
         at a  college  and  of  living  independently  without  appropriate
         support mechanisms  being  in  place  without  which  he  would  be
         susceptible to exploitation.

     35. Patrick Cavanagh is a Family Therapist with Kent  CAMHS.  He  wrote
         (30 September 2014) that the Appellant appears  as  a  traumatised,
         courageous young person. The best therapy for  him  is  to  have  a
         safe, secure, nurturing environment where he can begin to feel safe
         and secure within himself.

     36. Elizabeth Jackson is the Progression Mentor and  Designated  Member
         of Staff for Computing and Engineering at East  Kent  College.  She
         identified (2 December 2015) the Engineering course  the  Appellant
         was enrolled on. She noted his ability in Maths and  his  exemplary
         attendance, effort, and attainment. She  added  (8  December  2015)
         that the Appellant has a tendency to "go along" with  things  which
         could leave him in a vulnerable position. He mentioned  cannabis  a
         lot when discussing going back to Vietnam and she is  concerned  he
         could potentially start smoking it.  He  is  easily  influenced  by
         peers. He would have very little opportunity to reach his potential
         in Vietnam.

     37.  Gunes  Kalkan,  Assistant  Director  of  Policy  and  Research  at
         Barnardo's, noted (9 December 2015) from his own  observations  the
         close relationship the Appellant had with [K] and the very negative
         impact their separation would have on him.

The US Department of State, Trafficking in Persons Report  2015  on  Vietnam
(27 July 2015)

     38. Vietnam is a source country for men, women, and children  subjected
         to sex trafficking and forced labor within the country and  abroad.
         Debt bondage, passport confiscation, and threats of deportation are
         tactics commonly used to compel Vietnamese victims into  servitude.
         Victims are often recruited by relatives  or  acquaintances,  often
         with the knowledge, consent, or urging  of  close  family  members.
         Vietnamese  organized  crime   networks   recruit   and   transport
         Vietnamese nationals, especially children, to Europe - particularly
         the United Kingdom and Ireland - and subject them to  forced  labor
         on cannabis farms; they are lured with promises of  lucrative  jobs
         and compelled into servitude through debt bondage. Vietnam's  labor
         export companies - many affiliated with state-owned  enterprises  -
         sometimes charge fees in excess of the law for work abroad, leaving
         workers with exorbitant debts and vulnerable to  forced  labor  and
         debt bondage. Upon arrival in destination countries,  some  workers
         find themselves compelled to work  in  substandard  conditions  for
         little or no pay, with large debts and no credible avenues of legal
         recourse.

     39. The Government of Vietnam does not fully comply  with  the  minimum
         standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, it is making
         significant efforts to do so. Vietnamese authorities  continued  to
         prosecute and convict internal and transnational  sex  traffickers,
         but did not pursue  criminal  prosecutions  for  labor  traffickers
         exploiting  victims  transnationally   or   within   Vietnam.   The
         government reported an increased number of officials received anti-
         trafficking  training;  however,  many  officials  were  unable  to
         identify and investigate labor trafficking cases,  resulting  in  a
         failure to identify victims and to pursue  criminal  investigations
         in 2014. Often, government responses  to  overseas  workers  facing
         debt bondage or  forced  labor  situations  were  inconsistent  and
         inadequate. However, government officials abroad assisted with  the
         return of trafficking victims in 2014 and worked with NGOs to  help
         repatriate victims from China  and  Malaysia.  NGOs  report  border
         officials in high-risk trafficking areas increased their engagement
         to investigate trafficking cases, but official complicity  remained
         an impediment to anti-trafficking efforts in Vietnam.

     40. In 2014, the government  arrested  685  suspected  traffickers,  of
         which it prosecuted 472  (346  under  Article  119  and  126  under
         Article 120 of LPSAHT - see above [22])  and  convicted  413,  with
         sentences ranging mostly from 3 to 15 years' imprisonment, a slight
         decrease from the 420 offenders convicted in 2013. Authorities  did
         not report how many cases involved sex or labor trafficking or  how
         many were  for  internal  or  transnational  trafficking.  Although
         LPSAHT amendments provide a criminal law basis to  prosecute  these
         crimes, officials primarily  pursued  labor  trafficking  cases  as
         administrative violations under the country's labor laws, which  do
         not provide criminal penalties. Officials continued to  participate
         in joint investigations and rescue operations in  China,  Cambodia,
         and Laos. A lack of coordination across provincial agencies impeded
         overall  law  enforcement  progress  in  Vietnam,   and   officials
         sometimes  did  not  pursue  trafficking  investigations   due   to
         provincial budgetary constraints.

     41. The government demonstrated modest efforts to protect  victims.  In
         2014, authorities identified 1,031  potential  trafficking  victims
         but did not  report  how  many  were  exploited  in  sex  or  labor
         trafficking, how many were adults or children,  or  how  many  were
         exploited  in  Vietnam  or  abroad.  In   comparison,   authorities
         certified 982 trafficking victims in  2013.  Victim  identification
         and referral mechanisms remained weak throughout the  country.  The
         government had a formal procedure for victim identification, but it
         did not proactively employ it to identify victims among  vulnerable
         groups, such as women arrested for  prostitution,  migrant  workers
         returning  from  abroad,  and  child  laborers.  It  also  did  not
         systematically  refer  victims  to  protective  services   due   to
         inadequacies  that  persisted  in  its  formal  referral   process.
         Officials continued to conflate trafficking with  smuggling,  which
         precluded the identification of victims  who  voluntarily  migrated
         abroad.

     42. In 2014, the  Ministry  of  Labor,  Invalids,  and  Social  Affairs
         (MOLISA) provided  protection  and  reintegration  support  to  668
         trafficking victims, of which the government repatriated over half.
         Protection services varied by location but generally included legal
         aid, counseling,  shelter,  vocational  training,  healthcare,  and
         financial allowances. Authorities did  not  report  the  number  of
         victims who used the one-time government cash subsidy - up  to  one
         million dong  ($50).  MOLISA's  social  protection  centers,  which
         provided services to a wide range of vulnerable  groups,  sometimes
         housed trafficking victims; these centers are often underfunded and
         lack appropriately trained personnel to assist victims. The Vietnam
         Women's Union, in partnership with  NGOs  and  with  foreign  donor
         funding, continued to operate three shelters in urban areas, one of
         which was trafficking-specific. Vietnam had no shelters or services
         specifically for assisting male or child victims and  none  devoted
         specifically to victims of labor  trafficking.  Vietnam  maintained
         labor attach�s at their embassies in nine countries receiving large
         numbers of documented Vietnamese migrant workers; however,  reports
         allege  some  Vietnamese  diplomatic  personnel  lacked  sufficient
         training to adequately assist victims.  Vietnam  lacked  diplomatic
         representation or bilateral agreements with  some  countries  where
         Vietnamese  citizens  were  subjected  to  trafficking,  inhibiting
         victims'  access  to  government  assistance   and   impeding   the
         government's  protection  efforts.  In  some  repatriation   cases,
         Vietnamese   diplomatic   missions   provided   basic   provisions,
         transportation, and healthcare to Vietnamese victims  subjected  to
         trafficking   abroad.   The   government   reportedly    encouraged
         trafficking victims  to  assist  in  judicial  proceedings  against
         traffickers  and  offered  some  protection  and  compensation   to
         victims, yet victims expressed trepidation to use  them  given  the
         endemic  social  stigma  attached  to  being  a  victim,  fear   of
         retribution in their local communities, and fear of punishment  for
         illegal  acts  committed  in  the  course  of  being  subjected  to
         trafficking. Vietnamese law protects victims from being  prosecuted
         for  actions  taken  as  a  consequence  of  being   subjected   to
         trafficking;  however,  officials  are  not  properly  trained   in
         identification of trafficking victims, which may have  led  to  the
         treatment of some victims as  criminals.  The  government  did  not
         offer foreign  victims  legal  alternatives  to  their  removal  to
         countries where they faced retribution or hardship.

     43. The government maintained efforts to  prevent  trafficking.  During
         the latter part of 2014 and early 2015,  the  government  commenced
         initial planning of a  new  four-year  (2016-2020)  national  anti-
         trafficking  action  plan  by  developing  future  anti-trafficking
         priorities,  though  it  did  not  include  a  specific   budgetary
         allotment for its implementation.  The  government  shared  limited
         information  on   trafficking   statistics   and   anti-trafficking
         operations with  the  international  community,  but  the  lack  of
         accurate reporting on labor  trafficking  stymied  anti-trafficking
         progress in the country.

Other Background Evidence

     44. The MDGIF  Report  (January  2012)  reported  that  when  boys  are
         trafficked they bear less discrimination from  the  community  than
         trafficked girls because trafficking is still widely  perceived  as
         for sexual exploitation only, and boys are perceived as  not  being
         vulnerable to this type of exploitation.

     45. The Borgen Project Blog (24 July 2015) notes that Vietnam has  been
         praised  for  its  efforts  to  crack  down  on  child  trafficking
         internationally but its control of internal  trafficking  needs  to
         increase.

     46. The Le Thi Hoa report notes (in addition to that which is  referred
         to above [30] and in which he is described as a legal expert at the
         Ministry  of  Justice  in   Vietnam)   the   state   support   with
         repatriation,  and  support  for  essential  needs  and  travelling
         expenses,  medical  support,  psychological  support,  legal   aid,
         educational training, vocational training, and loans or short  term
         allowances for overcoming difficulty. Publicly run  social  welfare
         institutions shall support victims by providing shelter and subject
         to resources education and information. The support  measures  have
         not fully materialized, there are limited job or income  generating
         opportunities, and there are not enough shelters.

The Respondent's case

     47. It is accepted he has been trafficked by deception for the  purpose
         of sexual exploitation.

     48.  It  is  not  accepted  that  Vietnamese  victims  of   trafficking
         constitute a particular social group as there is no  evidence  that
         this group is set apart  or  recognised  as  a  distinct  group  by
         society  in  Vietnam.  He  would  not  give  evidence  against  the
         traffickers in Vietnam,  and  the  authorities  provide  sufficient
         protection and prosecute traffickers. His fear is  from  non  state
         agents of persecution, not the state.

     49. Vietnam is on the Tier 2 Watch list which means it does  not  fully
         comply with minimum standards to protect victims of trafficking but
         is making significant efforts to do so. The situation has  improved
         significantly  as  detailed  in  The  US   Department   of   State,
         Trafficking in Persons Report 2015 on Vietnam a copy of which I was
         provided with and  which  was  detailed  in  Mr  Jarvis's  skeleton
         argument. In particular adult males are not excluded from potential
         assistance including in mixed shelters, and  suspected  traffickers
         have been prosecuted and convicted.

     50. Little weight is placed on Ms Beddoe's view on the risk  on  return
         as there is no reference to her expertise in assessing that risk in
         Vietnam, and as the Appellant is not homosexual.

     51. He can  internally  relocate  given  the  size  and  population  of
         Vietnam, as there are  2  cities  with  populations  in  excess  of
         2,500,000, as he speaks the language and lived the majority of  his
         life there, and as  there  is  no  evidence  Tuan  or  his  claimed
         associates are linked to the government. He has improved  in  terms
         of his behaviour and social interaction  and  as  he  resisted  the
         influence of peers in respect of drugs. He would not  be  compelled
         to disclose the sexual abuse  to  Vietnamese  officials  and  would
         engage  in  getting  the  relevant  documents  from   here.   Local
         corruption does not extend to diplomatic and immigration officials.

     52. There is freedom of movement.  Children who do not have a household
         registration document are more likely to be arrested or harassed by
         the police  and  may  not  be  eligible  to  receive  basic  social
         services.

     53. His Article 3 claim was dismissed for the same reason.

     54. His Article 8 claim was dismissed as he has not lived  here  for  7
         years, has ties to Vietnam, and does not have any health  condition
         that meets the relevant thresholds. He  can  obtain  assistance  in
         tracing his grandmother.

Findings of Fact

     55. It is accepted that the Appellant was trafficked here when  he  was
         15 for the purpose of sexual exploitation and  that  deception  was
         practised in doing so. That is a preserved finding from the  First-
         tier Tribunal.

     56. I am satisfied it is reasonably likely Tuan, who was then 21/22 and
         is now 24/25, groomed, beat, and  repeatedly  raped  the  Appellant
         while he was a child. I accept that it is  reasonably  likely  Tuan
         was involved in an organised  criminal  gang  given  the  fact  the
         Appellant came with others clandestinely in a lorry and was given a
         mobile phone, and as arrangements were made for the group to be met
         here. The background  evidence  of  the  financial  servitude  that
         flowed from such an arrangement satisfies me that there is  a  real
         risk that those involved  will  seek  to  recover  their  financial
         outlay from the Appellant should they have the opportunity.

     57. I had the benefit of hearing from [K] and Helen Fowler.  They  were
         cross examined. Their evidence was consistent  across  the  various
         forms it was given, within itself, and with the written  statements
         from Gwen Wilkinson, Romana Ghorbani, Patrick  Cavanagh,  Elizabeth
         Jackson, and Gunes Kalkan all of whom  have  spent  time  with  the
         Appellant and are professionals in one capacity or another.  Whilst
         I place less weight on the evidence  of  those  who  did  not  give
         evidence than those  who  did  as  they  did  not  make  themselves
         available to have their views tested, I do not exclude it. I accept
         they have all told the truth as they see it as I see no reason  why
         any of them would lie and I see no evidence of collusion.

     58. Taken together, from the evidence I have seen and heard,  I  accept
         it is reasonably  likely  the  Appellant  lacks  maturity  and  the
         ability to stand up to Vietnamese people, and that whilst being now
         an adult, he acts as someone much younger and should be  considered
         to be a vulnerable young person. Whilst he was able to  resist  the
         drug offer here, that is just one example of limited self assertion
         amongst many that were given of subservience even whilst he  has  a
         supportive professional network with  a  consistent  message.  Once
         that support mechanism is removed, it is my judgement  that  it  is
         the subservient attitude that will prevail.  His  vulnerability  is
         exacerbated by the lack of family support he would have in  Vietnam
         as he should not be expected to return to his  grandmother's  home.
         That is because he would be at a real risk of  being  re-trafficked
         by Tuan.

     59. I accept that Christine Beddoe and Professor Bluth are  experts  on
         the situation for victims  of  trafficking  in  Vietnam  given  the
         length of their involvement in their specialist fields. Ms Beddoe's
         expertise is set out at [20] above and Professor  Bluth's  at  [28]
         above. I  accept  that  they  have  both  considered  the  relevant
         evidence and used their own  personal  knowledge  appropriately  to
         reach their views. Their views  accord  with  each  other  and  the
         background evidence. I agree that those males who are  the  victims
         of trafficking from Vietnam form part of a particular social  group
         as (c.f. SB (PSG - Protection  Regulations  -  Reg  6)  Moldova  CG
         [2008] UKAIT 00002) they share a  common  background  which  is  an
         immutable characteristic they cannot change which defines the group
         by giving it a distinct identity in the society in question and has
         nothing to do with the actions of the future  persecutors.  "Former
         victims of trafficking" and  "former  victims  of  trafficking  for
         sexual exploitation" are capable of being members of  a  particular
         social group because of their  shared  common  background  or  past
         experience of having been trafficked.

     60. Whilst I accept that the Vietnamese authorities  will  assist  with
         repatriation, and the background evidence indicates  a  willingness
         by  them  to  assist  with  reintegration,  given  the  Appellant's
         particular vulnerability, I am not  satisfied  that  the  embryonic
         support on the ground will enable him to be provided  with  shelter
         or a means of supporting himself should he internally relocate.  By
         far  the  most  persuasive  background  report  given  its   recent
         publication, independent source, and breadth, is the US  Department
         of State Trafficking in Persons Report 2015  which  was  relied  on
         heavily by the Respondent before  me.  The  most  worrying  feature
         arising  from  this  report  is  that  despite  the   international
         spotlight and legislation, Vietnam remains a source country for men
         subjected  to  sex   trafficking.   Debt   bondage   and   passport
         confiscation remain. Organised criminal gangs are  still  involved.
         The forced labour and exorbitant debt regime continues. Training of
         government official and agency co-operation  remained  problematic.
         Protection  services  varied  by  location.  Shelters   are   often
         underfunded and lack appropriately trained personnel. The one  time
         cash government subsidy of $50  is  plainly  of  little  use.  This
         report does not establish that there is sufficiency  of  protection
         from the state against non  state  agents  of  persecution  or  the
         viability of internal relocation  to  avoid  a  similar  fate.  The
         Appellant has never worked in Vietnam. He has no support mechanism.
         He would have no local contacts or family to assist him.  He  would
         be vulnerable to exploitation once again. There is a real  risk  he
         will once again fall into the hands of traffickers.

     61. The submission that the Appellant is not a homosexual and therefore
         would not have that "stigma" is not the issue. The issue is how  he
         would be perceived by others. He should not have to explain he  was
         raped as a child by a man. Nor should he have to disclose what  his
         sexuality is to obtain support from the community or professionals.

     62. The Appellant should not be expected to lie about his  reasons  for
         having left Vietnam. He behaves in a deferential manner.  He  lacks
         the skills to change that and  to  avoid  social  stigma,  official
         corruption, or local loan sharks and traffickers even if he  could,
         which I am satisfied he would not be able to given the evidence  of
         [K] which I accept (c.f. HJ (Iran) v SSHD;  HT  (Cameroon)  v  SSHD
         [2010] UKSC 31).

     63. Given the findings  I  have  made,  I  accept  he  is  entitled  to
         international protection and to be recognised as a refugee.

Human Rights

     64. Given the findings I have made it is clear  that  I  accept  it  is
         reasonably likely his Article 3 rights will be breached if returned
         to Vietnam.

NOTICE OF DECISION

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

    I set aside the decision.

    I allow the appeal on asylum grounds.

    I allow the appeal on human rights grounds.

    I make an anonymity direction.
