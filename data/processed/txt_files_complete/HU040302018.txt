For the Respondent:    Mr M Symes   (Counsel)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   This is an error of law hearing. The SSHD  is  the  appellant  in  this
    matter.  He appeals against the decision of  the  First  Tier  Tribunal
    (Judge JJ Callow) (FtT) promulgated on 4th December 2018 in  which  the
    Claimant's appeal on human rights grounds was allowed.



Background

2.   The Claimant is a citizen of Pakistan.  His appeal in  respect  of  his
    application for leave to remain in the UK on  the  basis  of  10  years
    continuous residence was  allowed  by  the  FtT  under  paragraph  276B
    Immigration Rules.  It was contended by the SSHD that his  conduct  and
    character were undesirable under paragraph  322(5)  Immigration  rules,
    because in a previous application for Tier 1 general leave he had  been
    awarded 20 points for his  earnings.   The  SSHD  considered  that  the
    Claimant had misrepresented his income and underpaid income tax for the
    tax year 2013 in order to obtain leave to remain.

Grounds of appeal

3.   In grounds of appeal the SSHD argued that the FtT  erred  in  absolving
    the Claimant of any blame for his failure to correctly declare his self
    employed income to HMRC; the assessment by the FtT was flawed.

4.   The FtT failed to follow the guidance at headnote  (v)  in  R  (on  the
    application of Khan) v SSHD (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph  322(5))
    [2018] UKUT 00384 (IAC), when assessing whether the Claimant's  actions
    could be viewed as dishonest.  The FtT did not provide reasons for  why
    the Claimant would not have been aware of the error in his  tax  return
    sooner given  that  his  tax  liability  would  have  been  lower  than
    expected.  The SSHD was entitled to draw inference  that  the  Claimant
    had been deceitful.

Permission to appeal

5.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal (UT) was granted  by  Deputy
    UTJ Davey on 28.1.2019.  In granting  permission  the  DUTJ  considered
    that it was arguable that the FtT erred in not following  the  approach
    set out in Khan [2018] UKUT 384 and in failing to  give  reasons.   The
    SSHD will need to address materiality.

Rule 24 response

6.   Mr Symes produced a response  opposing  the  grounds  of  appeal.   The
    Claimant had provided an amended tax return and  paid  the  outstanding
    amount.  He had acted carelessly and had left matters to his  financial
    advisors during a  time  when  he  was  visiting  his  sick  mother  in
    Pakistan.  There was evidence from his accountants confirming  that  in
    January 2016 an error in the self assessment  for  2013  was  detected.
    The FtT found that the SSHD failed to discharge the burden to show that
    the Claimant was dishonest.  Paragraphs  11-14  deal  with  the  issues
    under Khan.

Submissions

7.   At the hearing before me Mr Whitwell representing the SSHD argued  that
    the FtT had not fully applied or considered the  detailed  guidance  in
    Khan with reference to the headnote  at  (i),  (iv)  (v)  &  (vi).  The
    difference in the amount owed  was  significant;  between  �38,000  and
    �9,000 and which ought to have resulted in the Claimant taking personal
    responsibility at the time the return was submitted or acted sooner  to
    rectify the position.

8.   In response Mr Symes submitted that the FtT had  more  than  adequately
    disposed of the issues in the appeal in [9] and which  had  effectively
    covered the matters highlighted  in  Khan.   The  Claimant  produced  a
    detailed witness statement in addition to oral evidence and  was  found
    to be credible by the FtT. Mr Symes was not willing to concede that the
    judgment in Khan was handed down in time for it to have been relied on.



Discussion and conclusion

9.   I found no material error in law.  Whilst it  is  clear  that  the  FtT
    made no specific reference to  Khan,  it  is  equally  clear  that  the
    decision had not been before the FtT in any event, and did  not  appear
    to have been relied on by the representative for the Home Office at the
    First - tier Tribunal hearing. Having considered  the  headnote  points
    set out in Khan I am satisfied that the FtT considered in substance all
    of the material issues raised and I accept the arguments as set out  in
    paragraphs 11  -  14  of  the  Rule  24  response.   The  FtT  had  the
    opportunity to hear evidence from the Claimant and to asses the same in
    addition to his detailed witness statement at  paragraph  49.   He  was
    found to be a credible witness and the FtT  found  that  there  was  no
    dishonesty. The FtT  was  entitled  to  reach  those  findings  on  the
    evidence before it. The FtT had regard to the fact  that  the  Claimant
    repaid the outstanding tax within a few months of realisation  that  it
    was outstanding.  The FtT accepted his explanation that his accountants
    were at fault and found this to be a  plausible  explanation.  The  FtT
    found that there  was  no  significant  delay  in  addressing  the  tax
    discrepancy it having been brought to his attention in January 2016  by
    new accountants.  Although not specifically set out as a self direction
    I find no error on the part of the FtT in its approach to the burden of
    proof in this matter [9].

Decision

10.  There is no material error of law  disclosed  in  the  decision.    The
    appeal by the SSHD is dismissed. The Claimant's appeal  is  allowed  on
    human rights grounds
