For the Respondent:    Mr G Harrison, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


      1. On 1st June 2017, I granted permission to the appellant  to  appeal
         the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Bell  dismissing  his
         appeal against the decision of the respondent to  refuse  to  issue
         him with a Derivative Residence Card as  the  primary  carer  of  a
         British Citizen child resident in the  UK.  Neither  representative
         objected to my determining this appeal.


      2. The First-tier Tribunal judge found, and there was no challenge  to
         these findings by the respondent:


         *    [ZA] is the primary carer of the child, [U], date of birth [ ]
             2012;
         *    the child has lived with [ZA]  on  a  full  time  basis  since
             January 2016;
         *    they live in Cheetham and the child's mother lives in Oldham;
         *    [U]'s mother has to look after her 19 year  old  schizophrenic
             son, who could be hard to control at times and  aggressive  on
             occasions. He requires 24 hour care;
         *    [U]'s mother also has two other children aged 16  and  13  who
             she looks after (they are not [ZA]'s children);
         *    [U] sees his mother every couple of weeks;
         *    There is a strong bond between [U] and his father;  [U]  would
             be unhappy about moving to live with his mother.


      3. [U]'s mother gave evidence that she would be unable to  look  after
         [U] as well as her other three children. There was no challenge  to
         that evidence and Judge Bell found her a credible witness.


      4. Judge Bell refers to family proceedings  and  refers  to  a  family
         court order making clear that there were no safeguarding issues  as
         regards the oldest son. Mr Atuegbe was unable to confirm that leave
         of the family court had been obtained to disclose the family  court
         proceedings and orders but in any event, given the findings of  the
         judge (as set out above), made on the basis of the oral  and  other
         documentary evidence before her, they played  little  part  in  the
         decision save for the issue of safeguarding concerns.


      5. The judge quoted the correct regulation under  which  the  decision
         was to be taken, namely regulation 15A(4A) which states as follows:


         P [i.e. the appellant] satisfies the criteria in this paragraph if-
          a) P is the primary carer of a  British  Citizen  ("the  relevant
             British Citizen");
          b) The  relevant  British  Citizen  is  livening  in  the  United
             Kingdom; and
          c) The relevant British Citizen would be unable to reside in  the
             UK or in another EEA State if P were required to leave.


      6. The First-tier Tribunal judge, surprisingly in Mr Harrison's words,
         concluded that [U] would not be required to leave the  UK  if  [ZA]
         left the UK. The only basis upon which the judge  appears  to  have
         reached that conclusion, given her other findings and acceptance of
         the evidence before her, is that there were no safeguarding  issues
         with regard to the child. It is unclear on what basis that  finding
         was made, given that if reliance could be placed  upon  the  family
         proceedings record given that leave  of  the  court  had  not  been
         obtained to disclose, that information was considerably out of date
         by the time of the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  judge.
         Furthermore it is not a question of whether there are  safeguarding
         issues but whether, in fact, the child would be required  to  leave
         the UK.


      7. The totality of the evidence before the judge, which she  accepted,
         was that the mother would not be able to cope  with  looking  after
         this young child in addition to her schizophrenic son and other two
         minor children. Fortnightly contact is not an indication  that  the
         child could move home.


      8. I am satisfied the First-tier Tribunal judge erred in  law  in  her
         evaluation of the evidence such that the decision is set  aside  to
         be remade.


      9. On the basis  of  the  evidence  that  was  before  the  First-tier
         Tribunal and the findings made by the First-tier Tribunal there can
         only be one answer, namely that the appellant is successful in  his
         appeal. He is the primary carer of a British citizen child  who  is
         residing in the UK and who would be required to leave the  UK  with
         [ZA] if [ZA] were to leave the UK.


     10. I allow the appeal.


    Conclusions:


    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.


    The decision is set aside.


    I re-make the decision in the appeal by allowing it.
