Representation:
For the Appellant:           Ms S. Khan, Counsel instructed by Legal
Justice Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr Diwnycz, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellants are both nationals of Afghanistan. They are accepted  to
    be first cousins. It is accepted that upon their arrival in the  UK  in
    May 2016 they were both 12 years old.  At the date of the appeal before
    me they are both 14.  They appeal with permission the decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal (Judge Arullendran) to dismiss their linked  asylum
    appeals.




 2. The background to the appeals before the First-tier Tribunal  was  that
    both boys had claimed asylum soon after  they  arrived  in  the  United
    Kingdom in May 2016.  They asserted a fear of return to Afghanistan  on
    the grounds that they were minors who  had  been  trafficked,  and  who
    would be vulnerable to similar exploitation again. Their cases had been
    referred to the Competent Authority (CA) through the National  Referral
    Mechanism. The CA had found 'conclusive grounds' to  believe  that  the
    Second Appellant had been trafficked, but did not so find in respect of
    the First Appellant, whose case, insofar as it related to  a  claim  of
    trafficking, was  rejected  at  the  'reasonable  grounds'  stage.  The
    Respondent refused protection in both cases. She  did  not  accept  the
    boys' claims that their respective fathers had both been killed or that
    they were at risk of exploitation as internally displaced  children  in
    Kabul.


 3.  In  line  with  her  published  policy  the  Respondent  granted  both
    Appellants limited 'discretionary' leave to remain until  they  reached
    the age of 17�.  they were both placed with a paternal uncle who  lives
    in the UK but latterly the Second Appellant has left his  home  and  is
    now under the care of the local authority.

 4. When the matter came before the First-tier Tribunal the matter in issue
    was therefore whether the boys were entitled to  protection  under  the
    terms of the Refugee Convention. The burden lay on them to establish  a
    "reasonable likelihood" that they would face persecution for reasons of
    their membership of a particular social group, variously identified  in
    the papers as  'children  without  family  protection',  'children'  or
    'trafficked children'.

 5. The Tribunal made the following findings of fact:

              i) The First Appellant's father was  killed  by  an  explosion
                 although the cause of that explosion is unclear [�74]


             ii) The Second Appellant's father was killed, "possibly" by the
                 Taliban in Laghman province after he notified the police of
                 a bomb that had been planted by the Taliban [�74]

            iii) After the deaths  of  the  adult  men  in  the  family  the
                 remaining family members - all women and children  -  moved
                 to Kabul [�74]

             iv) After arrival in the city  the  Appellants  worked  on  the
                 streets in Kabul. They  were  collecting  scrap  metal  and
                 selling telephone cards when they were approached  by  some
                 men in a vehicle who invited them to work  for  them.  They
                 agreed to do so with the knowledge  of  their  mothers  and
                 grandmother. They earned between 3000 and 3500 Afghani  per
                 day which they would take home to their  family.  The  work
                 was domestic service. They cleaned a house,  washed  dishes
                 and provided massages.  If they made mistakes or did not do
                 their job 'properly' the men would shout at them  and  beat
                 them.  It was these men who arranged the boys'  passage  to
                 Europe, with the knowledge  and  consent  of  their  family
                 [�80].

              v) The Appellants have a number of family members still living
                 in Kabul. The family  unit  is  headed  by  their  paternal
                 grandmother, and living with her  are  the  boys'  mothers,
                 aunts, younger siblings and cousins [�75]. They  remain  in
                 contact with the Appellants [�77-78].

 6. As to the question of whether the experiences that  the  boys  narrated
    amounted to trafficking or modern slavery, the  Tribunal  rejected  the
    CA's decision in respect of the Second Appellant.  It  determined  that
    it had more evidence before it than the CA  had  been  shown  and  that
    accordingly it was in a  better  position  to  make  a  decision  about
    whether he had been trafficked.  Key to the Tribunal's  reasoning,  and
    this appeal, is the following passage [�79]:


         "I am not satisfied that the Appellants were abducted or forced  to
         leave Afghanistan because the evidence from the Appellants is  that
         they were working selling scrap metal and telephone cards, but they
         earned more money working for the people who brought them to Europe
         and their families were happy that they were  earning  this  money.
         Further, the evidence is that the Appellants worked for  more  than
         one month for the new employers, in  return  for  wages,  returning
         home and back to work willingly each day, before they were asked if
         they wanted to work in Europe. The  assertion  that  the  employers
         shouted at and beat the Appellants if they did something  wrong  is
         not indicative of forced labour, when viewed in the round, as there
         appears to be  no  evidence  of  compulsion  as  indicated  in  the
         objective material on trafficking".

 7. As to future risk the Tribunal said this [�81]:


         "....However,  even  if  I  am  wrong  and  the   Appellants   were
         trafficked, I find that this does not place them  in  a  particular
         social group and the Appellants are not at increased risk of  being
         re-trafficked if returned as they would have the protection of  the
         their families (given that their uncle knows where the family lives
         and  is  in  touch  with  his  mother):  AA  (unattended  children)
         Afghanistan CG [2012]. Thus, I find that the Appellants are not  at
         increased risk of being re-trafficked,  even  taking  into  account
         their particular vulnerabilities, as they will have the  protection
         of their immediate and extended family members  in  Afghanistan  as
         they all live in the same household".


 8. The appeals were thereby dismissed on protection grounds.

 9. In applying for permission to appeal Ms Khan  made  six  particularised
    complaints about the approach taken by the First-tier  Tribunal.  Given
    the way that the argument developed before me I need only address two.



    The CA Decision

10. The first ground concerned the Tribunal's decision to depart  from  the
    finding of the CA and go behind the express concession of fact made  by
    the Respondent that the Second Appellant  at  least  was  a  victim  of
    modern slavery.   The Respondent had accepted that to be the  case  and
    had not  resiled  from  that  position  at  the  hearing  before  Judge
    Arullendran. Neither party were given  any  notice  that  the  Tribunal
    intended to reject the conclusion of the CA  and  the  Respondent.   Ms
    Khan submitted that this was a fundamental error of procedural fairness
    and Mr Diwnycz agreed. He further agreed that since this matter was  of
    central importance to the risk assessment -  of  both  Appellants-  the
    decision as a whole was unsafe. He invited me to remit  the  matter  to
    the First-tier Tribunal.


11. For reasons that will become clear I have not  considered  that  to  be
    necessary. I agree that the Tribunal  had  in  these  circumstances  no
    business going behind a concession of fact made by the Respondent.   If
    the Tribunal had concerns about the terms of the concession, or whether
    it had been properly made at all, the correct approach would have  been
    to inform the parties of the same and invite submissions on the  point.
    I note that in the recent decision of Secretary of State for  the  Home
    Department v MS (Pakistan) [2018] EWCA Civ 594 the Court of Appeal made
    clear that absent obvious perversity it is not for  Judges  to  take  a
    different view to that reached by the CA on questions  of  trafficking.
    Judge Arullendran did not have the benefit of  that  decision  and  was
    perhaps under the impression, given by McCloskey  J  in  MS  (Pakistan)
    [2013] UKUT 1469 (IAC), that 'kindred public law  misdemeanours',  such
    as a failure to consider all relevant evidence, could open the door  to
    a full scale review by the Tribunal.    As the  Court  of  Appeal  have
    made clear, that is not the case. As the parties have  rightly  agreed,
    in these appeals there was moreover the additional matter  of  fairness
    and procedural propriety.  Ground (i) is therefore made out.




    Risk as Children


12. Ms Khan gratefully accepted the Respondent's concession in  respect  of
    ground (i) but urged me not to remit the appeals. That was because, she
    submitted, on a proper analysis of the law as it  stands,  the  Refugee
    Convention claims of both boys were made out on the  findings  of  fact
    made by the Judge.


13. I have set out above the crux of the reasoning on future risk,  at  the
    First-tier Tribunal's �79 and 81.  That was that they could  return  to
    their family and live much as they did before.  Crucially,  they  would
    have the 'protection' of their family, and would  face  no  "increased"
    risk.

14. I am satisfied that in approaching that risk assessment in the way that
    it did the First-tier Tribunal made several errors of law.

15. First, it failed to  have  regard  to  the  nature  of  the  family  in
    question. The Judge herself had accepted that the family unit consisted
    of the boys' grandmother, mothers, aunts and  other  children.  It  had
    accepted that both male heads of family had been  killed.   There  was,
    according to the country  background  material,  the  Respondent's  own
    policy  and  the  Upper  Tribunal's  country  guidance,   a  particular
    significance in the fact that this  was  now  a  female-led  household.
    This is, again, a matter not contested by the Respondent so  I  do  not
    need to set out here all of the  many  references  there  were  in  the
    papers before the First-tier Tribunal to the vulnerability  of  female-
    led households. It suffices to refer to the  decision  in  AK  (Article
    15(c)) Afghanistan [2012] UKUT 00163 (IAC) in which the Tribunal agreed
    with the Respondent that it would be unreasonable to expect lone  women
    and female heads of household to  internally  relocate  to  Kabul  (see
    headnote (v)). That position has been expressly maintained in the  most
    recent decision of the Upper Tribunal: AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan
    CG [2018] UKUT 00118 (IAC) (at headnote 7). It  is,  Ms  Khan  submits,
    implicit in that finding that it  is  not  only  unreasonable  for  the
    female 'heads of family' to internally relocate, but it  must  also  be
    unreasonable for those in their care. Mr Diwnycz made no submissions to
    the contrary and I agree with Ms Khan that hers is a  sensible  reading
    of the guidance.


16. Given that the First-tier Tribunal accepted that these two children are
    from Laghman, and that their family now resides in Kabul  as  IDPs,  it
    follows that their  appeals  must  be  allowed  on  Refugee  Convention
    grounds. They would be internally relocating to Kabul as  minors  in  a
    female-headed household and according to the Respondent's own  position
    and country guidance, that would not be reasonable.

17. Ms Khan did not however stop her submissions  there.  She  pointed  out
    that in fact  the  experiences  of  these  children,  accepted  by  the
    Tribunal, serve as a potent illustration as to why it  is  unreasonable
    to expect female-led households to relocate to Kabul.  In  the  absence
    of any male adults who could go out to work to support the  family,  it
    fell to these two boys to go out onto the street and make a living with
    which to support their numerous relatives. On the chronology  presented
    it would seem that they started doing that from the age of  about  ten.
    In AA (unattended children) Afghanistan CG [2012] UKUT 00016 (IAC)  the
    Tribunal found that "unattached" children  living  or  working  on  the
    streets in Afghanistan "may be exposed to risk of serious  harm,  inter
    alia from indiscriminate violence, forced recruitment, sexual violence,
    trafficking and a lack of adequate arrangements for  child  protection"
    (headnote 2).

18. In response Mr Diwnycz rightly pointed out that these boys will have  a
    roof over their head and will have their mothers with them. This is not
    the paradigm AA case of an unaccompanied minor being returned  to  live
    on the street. I accept that this is correct. It is  also  however  the
    case that on the finding made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  these  boys
    have already been subjected to serious harm, having been compelled - by
    necessity and by their own family members - to work  on  the  dangerous
    and polluted streets of Kabul, and being beaten  and  abused  if  their
    work was not up to the standard of the men who employed them.  This  is
    precisely the sort of ill-treatment that so concerned the  Tribunal  in
    AA.  The key test would appear to be that set out in the  earlier  case
    of HK & Ors (minors-indiscriminate violence-forced recruitment  by  the
    Taliban-contact with family members) Afghanistan  CG  [2010]  UKUT  378
    (IAC), and adopted at paragraph 90 of  AA:  the  evidence  "presents  a
    bleak picture for children who are returned to Afghanistan and  who  do
    not have a family that will care for  them".   Where  that  family  are
    prepared, as found by the First-tier Tribunal here, to  allow  ten-year
    olds to work long hours in exploitative and  dangerous  situations,  it
    cannot be said that they are "caring" for those children  as  we  would
    understand it.

19. The final point I would make about the First-tier  Tribunal's  decision
    is its approach to past persecution and future risk.  Paragraph  79  of
    the decision gives the unfortunate  impression  that  in  order  to  be
    'trafficked' a victim must be abducted or forced to leave  his  country
    of origin. That is of course no part of the definition.  Many,  if  not
    most,  victims  of  trafficking  find  themselves  in   situations   of
    exploitation through some degree of "consent": "consent" to  travelling
    abroad in search of a better life, or as in this case the "consent"  of
    controlling family members.  That these children were  forced  to  work
    because of economic necessity and because social  convention  prevented
    their female relatives from doing so does not  lessen  the  dangers  or
    exploitation that  they  faced.   At  paragraph  81  the  determination
    indicates that in order to succeed  in  their  appeals  the  Appellants
    would need to demonstrate an increased  risk  of  harm.  There  was  of
    course no need for them to do so. They simply had  to  point  to  their
    past experiences, and the fact that in Kabul, nothing had changed.   As
    ten and eleven-year-olds their family had sent  them  out  to  work  in
    dangerous conditions where they were regularly beaten by the  employer.
     There was nothing to suggest that this  would  not  be  the  situation
    again.    That  harm  constituted  persecution  for  reasons  of  their
    membership of a particular social group  and  in  the  absence  of  any
    significant change in circumstances it was reasonably likely to  happen
    again.


20. I therefore decline Mr Diwnycz's invitation to remit  this  matter  for
    further hearing. On the findings made by the  First-tier  Tribunal  the
    appeal should  have  been  allowed,  and  I  therefore  substitute  its
    decision dismissing the appeal on protection grounds with one  allowing
    it with reference to the Refugee Convention.



    Anonymity Order

21. The Appellants are both children seeking protection.  Having had regard
    to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  and
    the Presidential Guidance  Note  No  1  of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:


         "Unless and until a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
        Appellants are granted anonymity.  No report of  these  proceedings
        shall directly or indirectly identify them or any member  of  their
        family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
        Appellants  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with  this
        direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

22. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside for error of law.


23. The decision in the appeals is remade as follows:


    "the appeals are allowed on protection grounds with  reference  to  the
    Refugee Convention"

24. There is an order for anonymity.
