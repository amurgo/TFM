For the Appellants:    Mr P Uzoechina, Legal Representative, Patterson & Co

For the Respondent:    Mr T Melvin, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                                  DECISION




  BACKGROUND

    1. By a decision promulgated on 13 February  2020  ("the  Decision"),  I
       found an error of law in the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
       Cohen promulgated on  9  July  2019.   I  therefore  set  aside  that
       decision and gave directions for the re-making of the  decision.   My
       error of law decision is appended hereto for ease of reference.

    2. My directions were extended by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill on  3  April
       2020.  The Appellants filed further evidence on 18 May 2020.  I refer
       to that evidence hereafter as [ABS/xx].  I  also  have  a  bundle  of
       evidence which was before the First-tier Tribunal which I refer to as
       [AB/xx].  Unfortunately, Mr Melvin did not have access to either  the
       initial or supplementary bundle as he did not have  the  Home  Office
       file.  He had asked the Appellants' representatives to send  that  to
       him electronically but Mr Uzoechina said  that  this  had  only  been
       requested on the day before the hearing and in any event he  did  not
       know how to scan in and send a full bundle.

    3. Although I accept that Mr Melvin was working remotely and not in  the
       Respondent's offices, the Respondent had ample notice of the  hearing
       and I fail to understand why she is unable to arrange for files to be
       sent to those dealing with hearings.  As it was, we managed to  avoid
       an adjournment by Mr Uzoechina presenting the evidence fully in  oral
       submissions followed by a summary of that evidence by me so that both
       sides could agree what the evidence showed.  Mr Melvin was then  able
       to make submissions about it.

    4. Mr Melvin also provided submissions in writing on the day before  the
       hearing which I have read and to which I have regard.

    5. The hearing took place via Skype for Business.  Both  representatives
       confirmed that they were able to follow the  hearing  throughout  and
       there were no technical difficulties.  Mrs [N]  (the  mother  of  the
       Appellants) also attended remotely but took no part in  the  hearing.
       Mr Uzoechina did not seek to call her to give evidence.   No  witness
       statement was in any event provided from her (nor indeed from any  of
       the Appellants or the EEA Sponsor).

  THE ISSUES AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK

    6. The factual background to this case is adequately set out at  [1]  to
       [3] of the Decision which also identifies at [26] the issues which  I
       need to determine. For ease of reference, those can be summarised  as
       follows:

             1) Is the EEA Sponsor exercising Treaty rights?  If he is, then
                the Fourth Appellant is entitled to succeed.  This issue was
                narrowed  by  Mr  Melvin's  written   submissions   as   the
                Respondent now concedes the issue regarding the  genuineness
                and marginality of employment.  In other words,  it  is  now
                accepted by the Respondent that the EEA Sponsor's employment
                can be relied upon as an exercise of Treaty rights, provided
                he remains in the UK exercising those rights.

             2) If the EEA Sponsor is found to be exercising Treaty  rights,
                is the Second Appellant entitled to  succeed  on  the  basis
                that she was  aged  under  21  years  at  the  date  of  the
                Respondent's decision although is now aged 22 years or  does
                she have to show dependency on the EEA  Sponsor  and/or  her
                mother?

             3) Assuming that the EEA Sponsor  is  found  to  be  exercising
                Treaty rights, are the First and Third  Appellants  (and  if
                necessary, the Second Appellant)  dependent  on  him  and/or
                their mother?

    7. It is not necessary for me to set  out  the  case-law  regarding  the
       assessment  of  genuineness  of  employment  given  the  Respondent's
       concession.  In any event, that issue is covered by  what  I  say  at
       [12] to [18] of the Decision.

    8. In relation to the second  issue  as  set  out  above,  Mr  Uzoechina
       submitted that the relevant date was the date of application.  When I
       asked him to  provide  authority  to  support  that  proposition,  he
       directed my attention to  section  85  Nationality,  Immigration  and
       Asylum  Act  2002  ("the  2002  Act")  which,  until  2014,  drew   a
       distinction between the evidence which could  be  considered  by  the
       Tribunal in an entry clearance case and that in an  in-country  case.
       That section was amended by the Immigration Act 2014  and  no  longer
       draws that distinction.  As such, Mr  Uzoechina's  reliance  on  this
       section is misconceived.  In any event, although this is  an  out  of
       country right of appeal it is against the refusal of  an  EEA  family
       permit under the Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations
       2016 ("the EEA  Regulations")  and  whilst  the  EEA  Regulations  do
       incorporate parts of the  2002  Act,  they  also  contain  their  own
       provisions regarding appeal rights as I come to below.

    9. Mr Uzoechina relied also on the case  of  Papajorgji  (EEA  spouse  -
       marriage of convenience) Greece [UKUT] 00038(IAC).  Although  he  did
       not cite any particular passage in support of his  argument  in  this
       regard (nor even take me to the case), he appears to have had in mind
       the following (taken from the Commission's Communication  annexed  to
       the judgment):

           "Measures taken by Member States to fight against  marriages  of
           convenience may not be such as to deter EU  citizens  and  their
           family members from making use of their right to  free  movement
           or unduly encroach on their legitimate  rights.  They  must  not
           undermine the effectiveness of Community law or discriminate  on
           grounds of nationality."

   10. I accept of course that, for the time being at least, family  members
       of an EEA national enjoy the right to join that national  in  the  UK
       exercising their rights in EU law and that  member  States  must  not
       place undue restrictions on the effectiveness of the rights under  EU
       law.  Mr Uzoechina did not however draw my attention to any provision
       of EU law which says anything about the relevant date  for  assessing
       whether a person is or is not a family member for the purposes of the
       EEA Regulations.

   11. By contrast, the EEA Regulations include at Schedule 2  reference  to
       the way in which the 2002 Act applies to appeals as follows:

           "SCHEDULE 2


           APPEALS TO THE FIRST-TIER TRIBUNAL


           1. The following provisions of, or made under, the 2002 Act have
           effect in relation to an appeal under these Regulations to the
           First-tier Tribunal as if it were an appeal against a decision
           of the Secretary of State under section 82(1) of the 2002 Act
           (right of appeal to the Tribunal)-


                section 84 (grounds of appeal), as though the sole permitted
                grounds of appeal were that the decision breaches the
                appellant's rights under the EU Treaties in respect of entry
                to or residence in the United Kingdom ("an EU ground of
                appeal"); ..."


   12. As that paragraph makes clear, the question is whether the refusal of
       the family permit "breaches" (present tense) an  appellant's  rights.
       Accordingly, that question has to be determined as at the date of the
       hearing.  That question can only be considered at that time  if  that
       is also the relevant date for assessment whether  the  appellant  has
       (or continues) to have  that  right.   It  follows  that  the  Second
       Appellant (as the First and Third Appellants)  can  only  succeed  if
       they continue to be family members notwithstanding that they are  now
       aged twenty-one years or over.

   13. Mr Uzoechina did not make any legal submissions concerning  the  test
       of dependency but, since this is  now  the  central  issue  in  these
       appeals, and in order to set the evidence in  its  legal  context,  I
       refer briefly to what I consider to be the most relevant cases.   The
       two relevant cases emerging from the  CJEU  are  Flora  May  Reyes  v
       Migrationsverket EU:C:2014:16 ("Reyes") and  Jia  v  Migrationsverket
       [2007] QB 545 ("Jia"). The first concerns, as here, a child  who  was
       over 21  years  and  needed  to  establish  dependency.   The  second
       concerns the parents of an EEA national  who,  similarly,  needed  to
       show that they were dependent on their son.  The issues  which  arose
       for determination in those cases were not those which arise here.

   14. For that reason, and for ease of reference, I turn  directly  to  the
       Court of Appeal's judgment in Lim v ECO (Manila) [2015] EWCA Civ 1383
       ("Lim") where the Court  cited  from  Reyes  and  Jia  and  made  the
       following observations which have some relevance to these appeals:

           "24.   The  case  [Reyes]  concerned  a  25-year-old  Philippine
                national who said that she had been unable to find  work  in
                the  Philippines.  She  was  financially  supported  by  her
                mother, who had become a German citizen,  and  her  mother's
                cohabiting partner, a Norwegian citizen, who both resided in
                Sweden. The first question in the reference by  the  Swedish
                court was, in essence, whether, in order to be  regarded  as
                dependent and so fall within the concept of family member, a
                direct descendant had to show  that  he  had  tried  without
                success to find employment in his country of  origin  or  to
                obtain a  subsistence  allowance  or  some  other  means  of
                supporting himself. Both the Advocate General and the  Court
                held that this  was  not  necessary,  which  was  of  course
                entirely in accordance with  the  earlier  authorities.  The
                Advocate  General  summarised  his  conclusions  as  follows
                (paragraph 69):

                    'On a proper construction of Article 2(2(c) of Directive
                    2004/38/EC of [the Citizens Directive] ... any member of
                    the family of a Union citizen who, for whatever  reason,
                    proves unable to  support  himself  in  his  country  of
                    origin and in fact finds himself in such a situation  of
                    dependence that the material  support  provided  by  the
                    Union citizen is necessary for his subsistence, is to be
                    considered to be a 'dependant'. As  regards  members  of
                    the nuclear family  deemed  to  be  dependants,  such  a
                    situation must really exist and may  be  proved  by  any
                    means.'

                So the reason  why  the  party  cannot  support  himself  or
                herself is irrelevant; the fact that he or she cannot do  so
                is critical. This  is  inconsistent  with  the  notion  that
                dependency is established merely from the fact that material
                support is provided. The court essentially adopted the  same
                approach, it said this:

                    '20.   In that regard, it must be noted that,  in  order
                    for a direct descendant, who is 21 years old  or  older,
                    of a Union citizen to be regarded as being a 'dependant'
                    of that citizen within the meaning of Article 2(2)(c) of
                    Directive 2004/38, the existence of a situation of  real
                    dependence   must   be   established   (see,   to   that
                    effect, Jia, paragraph 42).

                    21.    That dependent status is the result of a  factual
                    situation  characterised  by  the  fact  that   material
                    support for that family member is provided by the  Union
                    citizen who has exercised his right of free movement  or
                    by his spouse (see, to that effect, Jia, paragraph 35).

                    22.    In order  to  determine  the  existence  of  such
                    dependence, the host Member State must  assess  whether,
                    having regard to his financial  and  social  conditions,
                    the direct descendant who is 21 years old or older, of a
                    Union citizen, is not in a position to support  himself.
                    The need for material support must exist in the State of
                    origin of that descendant or the State whence he came at
                    the time when he applies to join that citizen  (see,  to
                    that effect, Jia paragraph 37).

                    23.    However,  there  is  no  need  to  determine  the
                    reasons  for  that  dependence  or  therefore  for   the
                    recourse  to  that  support.  That   interpretation   is
                    dictated in particular by  the  principle  according  to
                    which  the  provisions,  such  as   Directive   2004/38,
                    establishing the free movement of Union citizens,  which
                    constitute one of the foundations of the European Union,
                    must be construed broadly (see,  to  that  effect, Jia,
                    paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).

                    24.    The fact that, in circumstances such as those  in
                    question  in  the  main  proceedings,  a  Union  citizen
                    regularly, for a significant period, pays sum  of  money
                    to that  descendant,  necessary  in  order  for  him  to
                    support himself in the State of origin, is  such  as  to
                    show that the descendant  is  in  a  real  situation  of
                    dependence vis-�-vis that citizen.

                    25.    In those circumstances, that descendant cannot be
                    required, in addition, to establish that  he  has  tried
                    without success  to  find  work  or  obtain  subsistence
                    support from the authorities of his  country  of  origin
                    and/or otherwise tried to support himself.

                    26.    The requirement  for  such  additional  evidence,
                    which is  not  easy  to  provide  in  practice,  as  the
                    Advocate General noted in point 60 of  his  Opinion,  is
                    likely  to  make  it  excessively  difficult  for   that
                    descendant to obtain the right of residence in the  host
                    Member State, while the facts described in paragraph  24
                    of this judgment already show  that  a  real  dependence
                    exists.  Accordingly,  that  requirement  is  likely  to
                    deprive Articles 2(2)(c) and 7 of Directive  2004/38  of
                    their proper effect.

                    27.     Furthermore,  it  is  not  excluded  that   that
                    requirement  obliges  that  descendant  to   take   more
                    complicated steps, such  as  trying  to  obtain  various
                    certificates stating that he has not found any  work  or
                    obtained any social allowance, than that of obtaining  a
                    document of the competent  authority  of  the  State  of
                    origin or  the  State  from  which  the  applicant  came
                    attesting to the existence of a situation of dependence.
                    The Court has already held that such a  document  cannot
                    constitute a condition for  the  issue  of  a  residence
                    permit (Jia paragraph 42).'

            25. In my judgment, this makes it unambiguously clear that it is
                not enough simply to show that financial support is in  fact
                provided by the EU citizen to the family member.  There  are
                numerous references  in  these  paragraphs  which  are  only
                consistent with a notion that the family  member  must  need
                this support from his or her relatives in order to meet  his
                or her basic needs. For example, paragraph 20 refers to  the
                existence of 'a situation of real dependence' which must  be
                established; paragraph 22 is even more striking  and  refers
                to the need for material support in the state of origin of
                the  descendant  'who  is  not  in  a  position  to  support
                himself'; and paragraph 24 requires that  financial  support
                must be 'necessary' for the putative  dependant  to  support
                himself in the state of origin. It is also pertinent to note
                that in paragraph 22, in  the  context  of  considering  the
                Citizens Directive, the court specifically approved the test
                adopted in Jia at paragraph 37, namely that:

                    'The need for material support must exist in  the  State
                    of origin of those relatives or the  State  whence  they
                    came at the time when they apply to join  the  Community
                    national.'"

   15. It might appear at first blush from that last sentence that the  date
       at which support needs to be assessed is at the date  when  a  person
       applies to join the EEA national or  that  national's  spouse.   That
       might appear to undermine the conclusion I  reached  above  regarding
       the relevant date to assess dependency (in  relation  to  the  Second
       Appellant).  It does not.  That has to be read in the  context  of  a
       distinction being drawn between  the  situation  in  the  country  of
       origin and that in the member State.

   16. With those observations in mind,  I  therefore  turn  to  assess  the
       evidence under the headings of the issues which I have identified set
       in the context of the legal framework.

  THE EVIDENCE, ASSESSMENT OF EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS

  The Sponsor's Employment

   17. As I identified at [10] of the Decision,  Judge  Cohen  accepted  the
       genuineness of the EEA Sponsor's employment based  on  the  documents
       before him.  That finding was not at issue at the error of law stage.
        Judge Cohen's finding is set out at [10] of my earlier decision  and
       I adopt that finding.  Accordingly,  it  is  accepted  that  the  EEA
       Sponsor earned �5747.21 in the tax year to  April  2018.   There  are
       some bank statements in the Appellant's bundle  ([AB/8]  and  AB/12])
       which show income in the region of �350-�400 per  month  after  April
       2018.  There is no evidence post-dating August 2018 that I have  been
       able to find save for confirmation from  the  Director  of  Zone  One
       Cleaning & Allied Services Ltd dated 4 June 2019 (not in the  bundle)
       confirming the accuracy of her handwritten annotations on the  letter
       dated 30 April 2019 (at [AB/1]) which show  that  the  EEA  Sponsor's
       employment was transferred to that company following the  dissolution
       of Zone One Cleaning Ltd in 2017.  It is on  that  basis  that  Judge
       Cohen was prepared to accept that the EEA Sponsor remained in the  UK
       exercising Treaty rights as at the date of the hearing before him  on
       11 June 2019.

   18. I am of course considering these appeals over one year on from  Judge
       Cohen's decision and no further evidence has been provided  from  the
       EEA Sponsor or  in  relation  to  his  employment.   However,  I  was
       informed by Mr Uzoechina  on  instructions  that  the  EEA  Sponsor's
       employment remains as it was previously.  I have no evidence from the
       Respondent that the position has changed and, as I have already said,
       the Respondent did not challenge the Judge's finding in this  regard.
       The issue at error  of  law  stage  was  whether  the  EEA  Sponsor's
       employment is marginal rather than genuine and  effective,  but  that
       issue was conceded by Mr Melvin for this hearing.   It  is  therefore
       perhaps  unsurprising  that  the  Appellants  did  not  consider   it
       necessary to update the evidence in relation  to  the  EEA  Sponsor's
       continued employment for the hearing before me.

   19. One of the reasons why I found an  error  of  law  in  Judge  Cohen's
       decision was because he had not taken into account  the  earnings  of
       the Appellants' mother.  Her earnings are  evidenced  at  [AB/40-43].
       The most recent evidence is the P60 for the tax year  to  April  2018
       which shows income of �22,275.20 for that tax year.  Again, there  is
       no updating evidence but, again,  Mr  Uzoechina  confirmed  that  her
       employment position remains the same.

   20. Of course, the sole issue  for  me  is  whether  "the  [Respondent's]
       decision breaches the [Appellants'] rights under the EU  Treaties  in
       respect of entry to or residence in the United  Kingdom".   Whilst  I
       have already concluded that the determinative date for assessment  of
       that issue is the date of the hearing before me, I  consider  that  I
       can rely on the  earlier  findings  as  to  the  genuineness  of  the
       employment of the EEA Sponsor when reaching  my  decision.   If  that
       position is later proved to have changed, as a matter of  fact,  that
       is  something  which  the  Respondent  may  take  into  account  when
       considering whether to issue the EEA Family Permit.

   21. It follows from the foregoing, though,  that  on  the  basis  of  the
       current position as I understand it  to  be,  the  Fourth  Appellant,
       [JN], is entitled to succeed in her appeal as she was and is a  child
       aged under 21 years of the spouse of an EEA Sponsor exercising Treaty
       rights in the UK.

  The position of the Second Appellant

   22. I have set out the slightly different factual position of the  Second
       Appellant, Mirabel [N], at [20] of the Decision and  I  identify  the
       relevance of that different position as Issue (2) at  [6]  above.   I
       have explained at [8] to [12] above why I consider the relevant  date
       for assessment of her position to be the date of the  hearing  before
       me.  She is therefore aged 21 years or more at the relevant date  (in
       fact now aged 22 years) and therefore, in order to succeed,  she,  as
       the First and Third Appellants needs to show that she is dependent on
       her EEA national stepfather or  her  mother.   I  therefore  turn  to
       consider the evidence of dependency put forward by the First,  Second
       and Third Appellants.

  Dependency of the First, Second and Third Appellants

   23. I begin my discussion of this issue with a schedule of  the  evidence
       before me.  That evidence consists largely if  not  solely  of  money
       transfers.  There is no witness statement  from  the  Appellants  nor
       even from their mother.  The money transfers are sometimes calculated
       in sterling but a number of  the  transfers  are  expressed  only  in
       Nigerian Naira.  Where that is so and although the  burden  of  proof
       lies on the Appellants in this regard and they should  have  provided
       evidence to show the calculation of those amounts in sterling, I have
       been prepared to  agree  an  approximate  calculation  based  on  the
       amounts shown in other money transfers in roughly the same period.  I
       have indicated in the schedules below where the calculation is  based
       on an approximation.  The other complicating factor in  the  evidence
       is that the transfers generally show the dates expressed  in  the  US
       form - that is to say month followed by day rather than vice versa. I
       have therefore assumed that all transfers are dated in that way. When
       setting out the amounts or approximate calculations, I  have  ignored
       the fees.  Some  of  the  transfers  are  duplicates  of  others  and
       therefore in some instances, two document references are given.

       Third Appellant: Sandra Chiamaka [N]
       26 February 2014 ([AB/99]): NGN 112,800 (�400)
       14 April 2014 ([AB/98]): NGN 229,600 (�800)

       1 November 2017 ([AB/113]): NGN 141,300 (approx. �300)

       31 January 2018 ([AB/115]): NGN 502,000 (approx. �1200)
       14 March 2018 ([AB/116]): NGN 75,000 (approx. �150)
       10 September 2018 ([AB/107-108]): NGN 92,400 (approx. �200)
       26 October 2018 ([AB/109-110]): NGN 47,100 (approx. �100)
       8 November 2018 ([AB/111-112]): NGN 46,700 (approx. �100)
       1 December 2018 ([AB/117]): NGN 46,500 (approx. �100)
       31 January 2019 ([AB/118A & 121]): NGN 92,464.62 (�200)

       5 March 2019 ([AB/118C]): NGN 232,461.66 (�500)
       30 April 2019 ([AB/118D]): NGN 45,947.99 (�100)

   24. In summary, therefore, the evidence shows that the Appellants' mother
       transferred to the First Appellant �2100 in 2018, �1900 in  2019  and
       �200 in 2020, to the Second Appellant �200 in  2016,  �900  in  2017,
       �500 in 2018, �850 in 2019 and �500 in  2020  and,  finally,  to  the
       Third Appellant �1200 in 2014, �300 in 2016, �1050 in 2017, �1850  in
       2018, and �1300 in 2019.  The dates and amounts fluctuate during  the
       period and as between the Appellants although I accept that there  is
       some pattern in the individual  amounts  transferred  (ie  those  are
       generally in multiples of �100).

   25. What is missing however is any evidence of  the  use  to  which  that
       money is put once received and that it is required by the  Appellants
       to fund their basic needs.  In this regard,  Mr  Uzoechina  submitted
       that it must follow that they require these funds  as  all  three  of
       these Appellants are students.

   26. In this regard, at [AB/71] there  is  a  copy  of  "Student  Personal
       Information" from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka showing that  the
       First Appellant was, in 2012, studying medicine at  that  university.
       That document is consistent with the membership card at  [AB/73].   I
       accept that the First Appellant's application form in 2018  indicates
       that he was, at that date, continuing with that study.  I accept also
       that the document at [AB/71] shows that the First Appellant's  mother
       was his sponsor albeit there is no evidence that  she  has  paid  his
       fees in that or any other year.  However,  the  document  at  [AB/72]
       which shows an offer of admission for the  course  printed  in  April
       2013 indicates that the course is of six years'  duration.   That  is
       not inconsistent with the application form but would suggest that the
       First Appellant completed his studies in  2018  or,  at  the  latest,
       2019.  There is no evidence as to his current position  in  terms  of
       his studies or employment.

   27. In relation to the Second Appellant, a document at [AB/125] indicates
       that she was studying dentistry also at the  University  of  Nigeria,
       Nsukka in 2015-2016. That is consistent with the document at [AB/126]
       which indicates that the Second Appellant was admitted  in  2015-2016
       and would graduate  in  2020-21.   That  information  is  not  though
       consistent with her application form where it is stated that she  was
       (in 2018) a student of information technology at "Yaba Tech".   There
       is no witness statement  clarifying  that  apparent  discrepancy  nor
       explaining how long that latter course was to last.

   28. In relation to the Third Appellant, a document at  [AB/96]  indicates
       that she  was  provisionally  offered  admission  to  Nnamdi  Azikiwe
       University, Awka for 2017/2018 to study law.  The course is  said  to
       be of four years' duration.  That is consistent with the student card
       at  [AB/95].    However,  it  is  not  consistent  with  the   Fourth
       Appellant's application form (submitted in August 2018) which  states
       that she is a student of engineering at "Yaba Tech".  Again, there is
       no  witness  statement  clarifying  that  apparent  discrepancy   nor
       explaining, if that latter is the correct information, how long  that
       latter course is to last.

   29. I accept that all the Appellants say in their application forms  that
       they are supported by their mother and dependent  on  her.   However,
       there is very limited information about their  expenses.   The  First
       Appellant says that his living expenses are  NGN  100,000  per  month
       (which roughly equates to �200 and is less than the amount which  his
       mother was transferring on a regular basis), and the Second and Third
       Appellants both give their expenses as NGN 30,000 which I  accept  is
       less than their mother was transferring at that time but there is  no
       further detail setting out to what  those  expenses  relate.   As  Mr
       Melvin pointed out, all three Appellants give their address as living
       with their grandmother in a house in Lagos which it appears is  owned
       by their mother.  Mr Uzoechina queried whether that could  be  right,
       at least so far as the First Appellant is concerned, as he said  that
       it would not be possible to live in Lagos and study at the University
       of Nigeria which is at some distance from Lagos.  He  said  therefore
       that I should assume that the First Appellant was  living  away  from
       home  and  likewise  those  other  Appellants  who  are  studying  at
       institutions outside Lagos.

   30. It is not though for me to assume anything or indeed speculate as  to
       what the position was or is either at the date of application  or  at
       the date of the hearing before me.  The burden is on  the  Appellants
       to show that, as at the date of the hearing, they  are  dependent  on
       their mother.  Even if I was prepared to  accept  that  the  evidence
       tends to show that they were dependent in 2018 (which I am not due to
       the paucity of such evidence), there is no evidence  of  the  current
       position.  There is no evidence to  show  that  all  three  of  these
       Appellants remain students  and  not  in  employment.   There  is  no
       evidence whether they receive financial support from  elsewhere,  for
       example from their grandmother or their father.   Mr  Uzoechina  said
       that their father was not in contact with them, but I only  have  his
       word for that; it is not of course for a legal representative to give
       evidence on behalf of his clients.

   31. Finally, I come back to the guidance given by the Court of Appeal  in
       Lim (see [14] above).  It is not enough simply to provide information
       that payments are being made.  There  must  be  evidence  that  those
       payments are needed by the recipient to meet his or her basic  needs.
       In these cases, there is no such evidence.  To find otherwise on  the
       very limited information provided in the application  forms  in  2018
       (which information is in any event dated some two years' ago  and  is
       itself insufficient) would amount to speculation.

   32. For those reasons, the First, Second and Third Appellants have failed
       to show that they are  dependent  on  their  mother  and/or  the  EEA
       Sponsor.  For that reason, they do not fall within the definition  of
       a family member within Regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations and  their
       appeals therefore fail.

  SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

   33. In spite of the lack of up-to-date evidence as at date of hearing,  I
       have accepted that the EEA Sponsor is exercising Treaty rights in the
       UK.  It is now accepted by the Respondent  that  the  evidence  shows
       that his employment is not marginal and is effective.

   34. The Fourth Appellant is accepted to be the child of the spouse of the
       EEA Sponsor.  She remains under the age of 21 years.  On the  premise
       that the EEA Sponsor does continue to exercise Treaty rights  in  the
       UK (which may need to be checked before  the  EEA  family  permit  is
       issued), the Fourth Appellant succeeds in  her  appeal.  She  is  the
       family member of the EEA Sponsor as the child of that person's spouse
       aged under 21 years.

   35. Although the Second Appellant was aged under 21 years at the date  of
       her application, she is now aged over 21 years.  The relevant date to
       assess whether she is a family member under regulation 7 of  the  EEA
       Regulations is date of hearing.  The Second Appellant therefore needs
       to demonstrate that she remains dependent on the EEA  Sponsor  and/or
       his spouse (her mother) in order to succeed.

   36. Similarly, the First and Third Appellants who are and were both  aged
       over 21 years at all relevant dates,  need  to  show  that  they  are
       dependent on the EEA Sponsor and/or his spouse (their mother).

   37. The First, Second and Third Appellants  having  failed  to  establish
       their dependency on the EEA Sponsor and/or his spouse (their mother).
       They do not therefore qualify as family members for the  purposes  of
       regulation 7 of the EEA Regulations.  Their appeals therefore fail.

DECISION

The appeal of the Fourth Appellant ([JN]) is allowed.

The appeals of the First, Second and  Third  Appellants  (Ignatius,  Mirabel
and Sandra) are dismissed

                    ERROR OF LAW DECISION AND DIRECTIONS

  BACKGROUND

    1. The Appellants appeal against a decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge
       Cohen promulgated on 9 July 2019 ("the  Decision")  dismissing  their
       appeals against  the  Respondent's  decisions  dated  on  13  and  19
       September 2018 refusing each of them an  EEA  family  permit  as  the
       stepchildren of an EEA National, Mr Pina de Cruz ("the  Sponsor"),  a
       Portuguese national to whom their mother is married.

    2. The Respondent's decisions were made under the Immigration  (European
       Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ("the EEA Regulations")  and  not  as
       the  Judge  appears  to  have  thought  the  2006  Regulations.   The
       Respondent's decisions were made by an Entry  Clearance  Officer  and
       were confirmed by an Entry Clearance Manager.   The  reason  for  the
       refusals were that the Sponsor is  not  a  qualified  person  as  his
       employment was not considered to be genuine and/or was considered  to
       be marginal and not effective.  The First to Third Appellants are all
       now aged over 21 years. The First and Third Appellants were also aged
       21 years or over as at the date of the  Respondent's  decisions.  The
       Respondent considered their  applications  on  the  basis  that  they
       needed to show dependency on the  Sponsor.   That  was  not  accepted
       either.

    3. The Appellants are all nationals of Nigeria where  they  continue  to
       reside.  As will become  apparent,  their  ages  are  material.   The
       applications were made between 12 and  15  August  2018.   The  First
       Appellant (Ignatius) was born on 9 September 1996.  He was  therefore
       aged 21 years at date of application and 22  years  at  date  of  the
       Decision.  The Second Appellant (Mirabel) was born on 15  June  1998.
       She was therefore aged 20 years as at  date  of  application  and  21
       years as at date of the Decision.  The Third Appellant  (Sandra)  was
       born on 26 May 1995.  She was aged 23 years at  date  of  application
       and 24 years at date of the Decision.  The  Fourth  Appellant  ([JN])
       was born on 30 March 2003 and was therefore aged 15 years at date  of
       application and 16 years at date of the Decision.

    4. The Judge concluded that the Sponsor's employment  was  marginal  and
       not effective, essentially because his earnings did not meet the HMRC
       primary earnings threshold.  He therefore concluded that the  Sponsor
       was not a qualified person.  He also concluded  that  the  Appellants
       had not shown that they were dependent on the Sponsor.

    5. The Appellants appealed on five grounds as follows:

           Ground 1: The Judge is said to have  erred  by  considering  the
           facts as at date of hearing.   The  Appellants  rely  on  s85(5)
           Nationality, Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002.   The  version
           relied upon is that prior to amendment by  the  Immigration  Act
           2014.

           Ground 2: The Judge is said to have  erred  by  considering  the
           appeals of the Second and  Fourth  Appellants  under  the  wrong
           provision of the EEA Regulations as both were under the  age  of
           21 at date of application.

           Ground 3:  The  Appellants  accept  that  the  First  and  Third
           Appellants were above 21 years at date of their applications and
           therefore contend that  regulation  8  of  the  EEA  Regulations
           applied. They say that the Judge erred by rejecting evidence  of
           payments by their mother as showing dependency for the  purposes
           of the EEA Regulations.

           Ground 3a:  The Judge is said to have erred  in  his  conclusion
           that the Sponsor's employment was marginal  and  that  therefore
           the Sponsor was not a qualified person.

           Ground 4: The  Judge  is  said  to  have  unlawfully  failed  to
           consider the Appellants' family lives with their mother and  the
           Sponsor.

    6. Permission to appeal was refused by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  J  M
       Holmes on 15 October 2019 in the following terms so far as relevant:

           "...3. The grounds identify no arguable  error  of  law  in  the
           finding that the EEA national sponsor's employment at  the  date
           of application, date of decision, and date  of  hearing  was  so
           marginal in value that the Appellants had failed to  demonstrate
           that he was a qualified person exercising Treaty rights  in  the
           UK at those dates.  It follows that each  of  the  appeals  were
           bound to fail on this point alone."

    7. The Appellants renewed  their  applications  for  permission  on  all
       grounds.  Those applications came before UTJ Grubb who, in a decision
       dated 11 December  2019,  extended  time  for  the  applications  and
       granted the applications in part only for the following reasons:

           "...4. Ground 3a is arguable.  It is  arguable  that  the  judge
           applied the wrong approach as  to  whether  the  sponsor  was  a
           'worker' under EU law and so wrongly found that the sponsor  was
           a  'qualified  person'  in  para  [13].    The   yardstick   for
           determining whether the employment was 'marginal'  was  arguably
           wrong based upon HMRC's Primary Earning threshold.

           5. Grounds 2 and 3 are also arguable.  In  particular,  the  2nd
           and 4th appellants were under 21 (just in the case  of  the  2nd
           appellant) at the date of the hearing.  If so, they did not need
           to show dependency on the sponsor (step-father)  or  his  spouse
           (their mother) to come within the definition of 'family  member'
           in reg 7(1)(b).

           6. Ground 1 is not arguable.  The judge  was  correct,  applying
           s.85(4) of the NIA Act 2002 to consider the facts as at the date
           of hearing.  The ground, seeking to differentiate  the  position
           in entry clearance cases, would seem to be based  upon  the  now
           repealed position in s.85(5) before the Immigration Act 2014.

           7. Ground 4 is also not arguable.  Art 8 did not arise  in  this
           appeal  which  was  only  against  a  decision  under  the   EEA
           Regulations: the  appeal  was  restricted  to  EU  grounds  (see
           Amirteymour v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 353 and para 1 of Schedule  1
           to the 2016 EEA Regulations).

           8. For these reasons, permission to appeal is granted on Grounds
           2, 3 and 3a but is refused on Grounds 1 and 4"

    8. The appeals therefore come before me to determine whether there is an
       error of law which is material and, if I so find, to  either  re-make
       the decision myself or remit the appeals to the  First-tier  Tribunal
       to do so.

  DISCUSSION

  Ground 3a

    9. I begin with ground 3a as, unless the Appellants can  establish  that
       the Sponsor is a qualified person, none of them can succeed.

   10. The Respondent  had  challenged  the  genuineness  of  the  Sponsor's
       employment based on what were said to  be  discrepancies  within  the
       documents provided.  The Judge however accepted that he worked as  he
       claimed.  The Judge made the following findings in this regard:

           "13.   I accept that the sponsor worked for  the  first  company
           and subsequently for the  2nd  company  after  the  transfer  of
           business under the TUPE Regulations.  However, the  sponsor  has
           demonstrated ltd [sic] earnings from his employment.  In the tax
           year  ended  5  April  2018  he  demonstrates  gross  income  of
           �5747.21.  I have not been provided with his  P60  for  the  tax
           year ended April 2019.  I note  that  the  sponsor's  employment
           must not be marginal. In  order  to  be  considered  ineffective
           [sic] employment, the sponsor is  expected  to  reach  the  HMRC
           primary  earnings  threshold  (PET)  on   a   consistent   basis
           throughout the period of their employment.  The current  PET  is
           �157 per week gross or �680 per month gross equivalent to  �8164
           per annum.  The sponsor's earnings do not meet  this  threshold.
           In these circumstances I find that the sponsor's  employment  is
           marginal and therefore that he is not a qualified  national  and
           that he is not exercising Treaty Rights in  the  UK.   For  this
           reason I find that the appellants' appeals under the Regulations
           are bound to fail."

   11. Mr Uzoechina relied on two documents in support  of  the  Appellant's
       contention that this was an inadequate and unlawful conclusion on the
       evidence.

   12. First,  he  directed  my  attention  to  the  Respondent's  published
       guidance  entitled  "European  Economic  Area  nationals:   qualified
       persons" published on 20 November 2018 ("the Guidance").  I note that
       there is no indication that the  Guidance  was  before  Judge  Cohen.
       However, I consider it appropriate nonetheless to take  into  account
       the Respondent's published position as to when employment can be said
       to be marginal and not effective.  This appears at page [12]  of  the
       Guidance as follows:

      "Assessing whether the EEA national is a worker

           While there is no minimum amount of hours which an EEA  national
           must be employed for in  order  to  qualify  as  a  worker,  the
           employment must be genuine and effective  and  not  marginal  or
           supplementary.

           Effective work may have no formal contract but should have:

               . Something that is recognisably a labour contract

               . An employer

               . Agreement between the employer and employee that the worker
                 will perform certain tasks

               . Confirmation the employer will pay or offer services  (such
                 as free accommodation) or goods for the tasks performed.

           Marginal means the work involves so little time and  money  that
           it  is  unrelated  to  the  lifestyle  of  the  worker.   It  is
           supplementary because the worker is  clearly  spending  most  of
           their time on something else, not work.

           For example a student who works behind the student union bar for
           2 hours a week is actually a student, their work is marginal and
           supplementary to their actual role as a student.

           You must carefully assess each case on its  own  merits  to  see
           whether the EEA national's claimed  employment  is  genuine  and
           effective.

      Relevant considerations include:

               . Whether there is a genuine employer-employee relationship

               . Whether there is an employment contract

               . Whether the work is regular or intermittent

               . How long the EEA national has been employed for

               . Number of hours worked

               . Level of earnings"

   13. The Guidance then sets out two examples.  Mr Tufan submitted that the
       second is closer to this case.  That may be so in terms of the  level
       of earnings but the facts of the employment there are very different.



   14.  Mr  Uzoechina  next  took  me  to  the  CJEU  judgment  in  Levin  v
       Staatssecretaris van Justitie [1982] EUECJ R-53/81 (23  March  1982).
       Mr Uzoechina relied in particular on [2] of the headnote which  reads
       as follows:

           "The provisions of Community Law relating to freedom of movement
           for workers also cover a national of a Member State who pursues,
           within the territory of another Member State, an activity as  an
           employed person which yields an income lower than that which, in
           the latter State, is considered  as  the  minimum  required  for
           subsistence, whether that person supplements the income from his
           activity as an employed person with other income so as to arrive
           at that minimum or is satisfied with means of support lower than
           the said minimum, provided that he pursues  an  activity  as  an
           employed person which is effective and genuine."

   15. That part of the headnote is based on  [16]  of  the  judgment  which
       reads as follows:

           "It follows that the concepts of 'worker' and  'activity  as  an
           employed person' 'must be interpreted as meaning that the  rules
           relating to freedom of movement for workers also concern persons
           who pursue or wish to pursue an activity as an  employed  person
           on a part-time basis only and who, by virtue of that fact obtain
           or  would  obtain  only  remuneration  lower  than  the  minimum
           guaranteed remuneration in the sector under  consideration.   In
           this regard, no distinction may be made between those  who  wish
           to make do with their income from such an activity and those who
           supplement that income with other income, whether the latter  is
           derived from property or from the  employment  of  a  member  of
           their family who accompanies them."

   16. Mr Tufan, for his part, relied on a decision of  the  Upper  Tribunal
       (Administrative Appeals Chamber), DV v HMRC [2017] UKUT 155 (AAC) and
       in particular what is said at [15] to [17] of the decision.  I  pause
       to observe that this decision is made in the context  of  considering
       whether a Judge of the First-tier Tribunal had  erred  in  dismissing
       the appellant's appeal.  The relevant part  of  the  decision  relied
       upon by the Respondent is as follows:

           "15.   The tribunal did  not  adopt  the  sort  of  arithmetical
           approach to the relative amounts of earnings and benefits  which
           Mr  Kelly  criticised  it  for.   The  tribunal  considered  the
           Appellant's finances in the round as  indicating  the  level  of
           income she required and the extent to which the Big Issue income
           provided a real contribution towards it.  The relevance  of  the
           state benefits was  that  they  formed  the  bulk  of  what  the
           Appellant relied on.  Her earnings were a top-up  but  were  not
           'meaningful'  income.   The  conclusion  was  supported  by  the
           tribunal's finding that the Appellant did not keep sales records
           and was vague about how much her business generated.  That is an
           unexceptionable  approach,  as  illustrated  by  that  of  Upper
           Tribunal Judge Ward in HMRC v HD and GP [2017] UKUT 11  (AA)  at
           paragraphs 21 and 22.

           16.    I also reject Mr Kelly's  submission  that  the  tribunal
           treated the low level of  remuneration  as  determinative.   The
           statement of reasons demonstrates a careful  assessment  of  all
           relevant factors.  The tribunal found  that  the  Appellant  had
           built the business up to the current level of sales but they had
           since remained constant (and there was no suggestion that  sales
           were likely to increase).  The Appellant worked 40 hours a week,
           sold only 40 magazines and made a profit of  less  than  �2  per
           hour.  In all the circumstances the  tribunal  was  entitled  to
           conclude that the Appellant's business was not viable.  Mr Kelly
           agreed that productivity was relevant but says that  it  is  not
           clear what the tribunal meant by 'unviable'.  I  disagree.   The
           meaning is clear  from  the  tribunal's  reasons  which  I  have
           summarised.  Moreover although motive is  irrelevant  where  the
           economic activity is  genuine  and  effective,  the  reason  for
           continuing with an activity, particularly where that activity is
           not economically viable, can be relevant to the decision whether
           it is genuine  and  effective.   The  tribunal  noted  that  the
           Appellant had said that she was not interested in earning  more,
           whether through employment or  other  self-employment.   On  the
           evidence, she did not  need  to  do  so  because  of  the  state
           benefits that she received.

           17.    It was open to the tribunal to conclude, in the light  of
           all the evidence, that the business was  a  means  to  obtaining
           benefits and that the income from it was no more than a  'useful
           and necessary addition' to that income in the sense explained at
           paragraph 24 of the statement of reasons."

   17. I do not consider that this decision assists the Respondent  in  this
       case.  First, as is evident from the passage cited,  the  context  is
       very different.  The appellant's main income in that  case  was  from
       benefits supplemented by small amounts of earnings by  way  of  self-
       employment.  Here, as was submitted by Mr Uzoechina, the  Sponsor  is
       employed albeit on a part-time basis and his earnings from employment
       are his only income.  I was taken to his bank statements  at  [AB/7-8
       and 11-23] which corroborate that submission.  When I enquired how he
       and the Appellants' mother were maintaining themselves in that  case,
       I was told that the Appellants' mother also works.  There is evidence
       of that in the Appellants' bundle.  That is consistent with the other
       permissible routes of income envisaged by the  CJEU  in  Levin.   The
       second reason that I do not consider that the AAC decision assists is
       because it is only the  Upper  Tribunal's  consideration  whether  an
       error of law exists in a particular set  of  circumstances  which,  I
       repeat, are very different to the instant case.   Third  and  in  any
       event what is said by the Upper Tribunal there about  the  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge's reasoning in that case demonstrates that  the  Judge
       there had considered  wider  factors  and,  in  particular,  had  not
       "treated the low level of remuneration  as  determinative"  as  Judge
       Cohen did in this case.

   18. I also have regard to the Guidance even though that  was  not  before
       Judge Cohen.  The factors there  set  out  are  consistent  with  the
       holistic approach to the issue  whether  employment  is  marginal  as
       advocated by the CJEU in Levin.  I am therefore  satisfied  that  the
       Appellants have demonstrated that Judge  Cohen  fell  into  error  by
       failing to consider  all  the  relevant  elements  of  the  Sponsor's
       employment when reaching  the  conclusion  that  the  employment  was
       marginal and not effective.  In the alternative,  the  reasons  given
       are insufficient to justify the conclusion  and  fail  to  take  into
       account all the evidence.

   19. That is though not the end of the matter as I now  need  to  consider
       whether the error made is material which  requires  consideration  of
       the Appellants' other two grounds.

  Grounds 2 and 3

   20. I can deal very shortly with the appeals of  the  Second  and  Fourth
       Appellants.  Regulation 7(1)(b) of the EEA Regulations provides  that
       a family member includes the  dependent  of  the  spouse  of  an  EEA
       national aged under 21  years.   There  is  no  requirement  to  show
       dependency.  Although I accept that Regulation 7 does not specify  at
       what point in time age has to be established, that is irrelevant  for
       the purposes of the Fourth Appellant and may be  irrelevant  for  the
       purposes also of the Second Appellant as she was also aged  under  21
       years at date of the Respondent's decision although had turned 21  by
       the time of the Decision. In any event, however,  that  was  not  the
       basis on which Judge Cohen determined her case and the point requires
       further argument.

   21. I turn now to the position of the First and Third Appellants which is
       more nuanced.  On any view, both were aged 21 years or  over  at  the
       date of application, decision and date of hearing.  The  Judge  dealt
       with the position of all the Appellants in relation to dependency  at
       [14] of the Decision as follows:

           "Furthermore, the appellants need to demonstrate that  they  are
           mainly financially dependent upon the sponsor.  I have not  been
           provided  with   any   evidence   concerning   the   appellants'
           circumstances in Nigeria.  I note that the eldest  appellant  is
           23 years old.  Money transfers show that the transfers are  made
           by the appellant's mother rather than the sponsor.  The  sponsor
           is  low  paid.   I  am  not  satisfied   that   the   appellants
           demonstrated that they are mainly financially dependent upon the
           sponsor for their essential needs."

   22. Those findings are  clearly  in  error  in  relation  to  the  Fourth
       Appellant who remains under  the  age  of  21  years.   They  do  not
       consider the point of when the age of the Second Appellant  needs  to
       be assessed for these purposes.  As such, they are also in  error  in
       relation to her appeal.

   23. Turning then to the First and Third Appellants, the way in which  the
       Appellants' ground 3 is pleaded assumes that Regulation 8 applies  to
       their case.  It is said that the  First  and  Third  Appellants  fall
       within the category of extended family members  irrespective  whether
       the dependency is on the Sponsor or their mother, his  spouse.   That
       is incorrect.  Regulation 8(2) of the  EEA  Regulations  makes  plain
       that dependency within that regulation has to be on the EEA  national
       and not his spouse.  That is  confirmed  by  the  Court  of  Appeal's
       judgment in Fatima v Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department
       [2019] EWCA Civ 124.  If the First and Third Appellants are  required
       to demonstrate that they are extended family members, therefore,  the
       money transfers from their mother could not  evidence  that  (as  the
       Judge found).  Mr Uzoechina's endeavours to show that  the  money  in
       fact emanated from the Sponsor came to nought  particularly  when  it
       was clear that what he said was a joint bank  account  used  to  make
       payments was shown to be an account in the sole name of the Sponsor.

   24. However, there is a separate question whether  the  First  and  Third
       Appellants, notwithstanding that they are (and were) aged 21 or  over
       at all relevant times, can still fall within the definition of family
       members in Regulation 7 as that includes  not  simply  children  aged
       under 21 years but  also  children  who  are  dependent  on  the  EEA
       national  or  his  spouse.   Accordingly,  if  the  First  and  Third
       Appellants are able to establish dependency on their mother, this may
       be sufficient for the purposes of Regulation 7.  That issue  was  not
       however considered by the Judge and there is therefore no finding  as
       to what the evidence shows.

  CONCLUSIONS

   25. For the foregoing reasons, I accept that there is  an  error  of  law
       made in relation to all the Appellants.

   26. Although I had indicated at the hearing that I was inclined to  remit
       these appeals if I found an error of law, I  have  reconsidered  that
       position.  The issues in this case are narrow as the above discussion
       demonstrates.  They are limited to whether the  Sponsor's  employment
       is  marginal  and  ineffective,  and  whether  the  First  and  Third
       Appellants are able to establish dependency  on  the  Sponsor  and/or
       their mother.  There may also be an issue in relation to  the  Second
       Appellant as to the point in time at which the facts must be assessed
       in an EEA appeal but, in her case also, if she does not  fall  within
       the definition of a family member automatically based on age, she may
       be able to do so if she is able to demonstrate the requisite level of
       dependency.

   27. For those reasons, I have concluded that it is appropriate to  retain
       the appeals in this Tribunal.  Now that the issues which remain to be
       resolved are clarified by my decision, and in particular now that the
       Appellants understand that it is  appropriate  to  rely  on  evidence
       which post-dates the Respondent's decisions, I have given  directions
       to permit them to adduce such evidence prior to  a  resumed  hearing.





DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal Decision involves the making of a material error  on
a point of law. I therefore set aside the First-tier  Tribunal  Decision  of
Judge Cohen promulgated on 9 July 2019.  I  make  the  following  directions
for the re-making of the decision.

DIRECTIONS

      1. Within 28 days from the  date  when  this  decision  is  sent,  the
         Appellants shall file with the Tribunal and serve on the Respondent
         any further evidence on which they rely.

      2. The resumed hearing will be listed  on  the  first  available  date
         after 35 days from the date  when  this  decision  is  sent.   Time
         estimate is half a day.
