Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr D O'Callaghan & Miss J Lean


In D v United Kingdom  [1997]  24  EHRR  43,  the  claimant  came  into  the
exceptional category because he was beyond the reach of  medical  treatment,
and hence no medical care obligation was placed on the expelling  state.   A
seriously ill claimant who will, if he remains, require  continuing  medical
treatment for the foreseeable future, is not an exceptional case.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Introduction

1.    The appellant appeals against the decision of Immigration  Judge Dove
    Q.C., of 14 June 2010 reversing the appellant's decision of 12  March
    2010 refusing the respondent's application for leave to remain.

Immigration History

2.    The respondent is an Indian citizen and was  granted  entry  clearance
    as  a  working   holiday   maker,   with   such   leave   valid   until
    29 October 2006.

3.    He entered the United Kingdom on 1 November 2004.

4.    He overstayed.

5.    On 28 January 2009, the respondent applied for leave to remain in the
    United Kingdom on compassionate grounds.  The basis of  his  claim  was
    that he suffered from kidney failure and required regular dialysis, all
    as further detailed below.

6.    The application was refused by way of a decision dated 12 March 2010
    and directions were given for his removal from the United Kingdom.

7.    The respondent appealed to the  First  Tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  &
    Asylum Chamber) and his appeal was allowed by Immigration  Judge Dove,
    Q.C.  The Immigration Judge allowed the appeal on the basis of a breach
    of article 3 of the ECHR.

Medical History

8.    There was no dispute  between  the  parties  as  to  the  respondent's
    medical history which was as follows:

9.    In 2008 the respondent was suffering  from  high  blood  pressure  and
    attended for a blood test.

10.   On 5 January 2009, the test confirmed that he had  medical  problems
    relating to his kidneys.  He has advanced chronic kidney disease.  This
    is an irreversible condition.

11.   He requires dialysis three times a week for four hours per session.

12.   The respondent only has a single  kidney,  likely  due  to  congenital
    absence of his right kidney.

13.   Doctor James Medcalf, Consultant Nephrologist, University Hospital of
    Leicester, detailed in his report of 27 May 2010:

         "He (the respondent) is dependant on this treatment to remain alive
         and well, and would expect he would die after a period  of  one  to
         two weeks if the treatment was discontinued.  (The respondent) is a
         good candidate to  receive  renal  transplant,  and  we  have  been
         discussing with him whether any of his family could  offer  a  live
         kidney donor for him.  However, there are no firm plans to  proceed
         with this at present."


14.   The respondent is only able to walk for 10 to 15 mins at a slow pace.

Facts not in dispute

15.   The following facts were either accepted  or  not  challenged  by  the
    appellant before the Immigration Judge.  They were equally accepted  or
    not challenged before us.

16.   The respondent has uncles, aunts and cousins  settled  in  the  United
    Kingdom.

17.   He has a mother and two brothers resident in India.

18.   His mother does not enjoy good health.

19.   The nearest hospital to his village which is able to provide  dialysis
    is situated in Chandigar, some 300 kilometres away.

20.   Dialysis would cost �10,000 to �12,000 rupees per week  (�138  -  �166
    per week).

21.   The respondent could not afford to:

    (i)    pay for dialysis and


    (ii)   pay to support himself in Chandigar.

22.   The respondent would be unable to work so as to support himself.

23.   His mother and brothers are not able to support the respondent  so  as
    to secure medical treatment.

The decision of the Immigration Judge

24.   The Immigration Judge, having reminded himself of  the  principles  as
    outlined in D v United Kingdom [1997] 24 EHRR 43; Ben Said v United
    Kingdom (2001) 33 EHRR 10 and N v SSHD [2005] 2AC 296 decided that the
    respondent's medical circumstances were such as to bring him  into  the
    exceptional category whereby his removal from the United Kingdom  would
    amount to inhuman treatment of the kind prescribed by article 3 of the
    ECHR.  Having found a breach of article 3 he did not turn to  consider
    whether there had been a breach of article 8  which  was  also  argued
    before him.


25.   The Immigration Judge's reasoning for his decision can  be  summarised
    by  reference  to  the  following  section  in  paragraph  10  of   his
    determination:

         "11.      Whilst  theoretically  there  may  be  medical  treatment
             available to him in India, the practical reality is that there
             would be no opportunity for him to realistically avail himself
             of the dialysis which is essential to prevent his early death.
              In these circumstances in my judgement, his return  to  India
             would amount to inhuman treatment of the  kind  prescribed  by
             Article 3 ....."

Submissions

26.    Both  parties  made  oral  submissions.   The  appellant  provided  a
    detailed skeleton argument.  In summary, it was submitted that although
    the Immigration Judge had referred himself to the correct authorities,
    he had not properly applied the principles enunciated  therein  to  the
    circumstances of the instant case.  In particular it was submitted that
    the judge had erred in law by holding that the  respondent's  inability
    to access available treatment in India met the exceptional test as  set
    out in the authorities.

27.   In development of this argument  it  was  said  that  the  Immigration
    Judge when considering whether the exceptional test had  been  met  had
    failed to take proper account of what was  stated  to  be  the  general
    position set out by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in the N (FC)  v  SSHD
    case at paragraph 18:

         "No one could fail to be moved by the appellant's  situation.   But
         those acting on her behalf are seeking  to  press  the  obligations
         arising under the European Convention too far.  The problem derives
         from the disparity of medical facilities in different countries  of
         the world.  Despite this disparity, an  AIDS  sufferer's  need  for
         medical treatment does  not,  as  a  matter  of  Convention  right,
         entitle him to enter a contracting state and remain there in  order
         to obtain the treatment he or she so desperately needs."

28.   Moreover, it  was  submitted  that  the  point  which  was  constantly
    emphasised  in  the  authorities  was  that  in  order  to  succeed  an
    individual must bring himself into the very exceptional  category.   In
    the instant case, the Immigration Judge had allowed the appeal  on  the
    basis  that  although  appropriate  treatment  was  available  to   the
    respondent in India, the practical reality was that  he  would  not  be
    able to access it.  It was submitted that in holding that  this  factor
    brought the respondent into the exceptional  category  the  Immigration
    Judge had failed to have regard to the observations made by  Lord Hope
    of Craighead at paragraph 43 in the N (FC) v SSHD case  where  he  was
    considering the tensions between the D v UK case where it was held that
    there was a breach of article 3 and other European  decisions  on  the
    matter in which it had been held that there was no breach.   Lord Hope
    he argued had distilled the following principle at paragraph 43:

         "Two points stand out from this decision.  The first is that it was
         the applicant's present state of health that was subjected to close
         scrutiny.  This is, of course,  appropriate  where  a  decision  is
         being taken on grounds of humanity, because it ought to be based on
         the most up to date information that is available.   But  there  is
         more in the point than that.  It was the applicant's present  state
         of health that was critical to the decision in D v  United  Kingdom
         that  because  of  his  present  state  of  health  his  case   was
         exceptional.  The second is that the court did not apply  the  same
         high standard of scrutiny to the applicant's future prospects  were
         she to be returned to Zambia.  The question whether  she  would  be
         able to afford the treatment that was said to  be  available  there
         was not addressed, nor was her fate were it to turn  out  that  she
         could not  afford  it.   It  was  enough  that  the  treatment  was
         available".

29.   In light of the observations made by Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead  and
    Lord Hope of Craighead, it was submitted that the Immigration Judge had
    misunderstood the principles as set out above and had misapplied  these
    when considering  the  circumstances  of  the  present  case.   It  was
    submitted that  had  he  correctly  applied  these  principles  to  the
    circumstances of the instant case, then he would not have  allowed  the
    appeal.  There was accordingly a material error of law.

30.   Lastly we were taken to a recent consideration of these issues in  the
    case of KH (Afghanistan) [2009] EWCA CIV 1354.  This case involved an
    Afghani national  who  suffered  from  mental  health  problems.   Lord
    Justice Longmore made the following  observations  when  applying  the
    exceptionality test to the facts of that case;

         "The truth is that the presence of mental  illness  amongst  failed
         asylum seekers cannot really be regarded  as  exceptional.   Sadly,
         even asylum seekers with mental illness who have  no  families  can
         hardly be regarded as "very exceptional".  If this case  is  to  be
         regarded as a very exceptional one, there will inevitably be  cases
         which will be indistinguishable.  A person  with  no  family  would
         have to be equated with the person who has a family but his members
         are unwilling or unable to look after him or her.  I  cannot  think
         that Baroness Hale had such a wide category in mind.  In order for
         a case to be "very exceptional" it would  have  to  be  exceptional
         inside the class of  person  with  mental  illness  without  family
         support.  Perhaps a very old or very young person would qualify but
         hardly an ordinary adult".

31.   It was  argued  that  with  respect  to  the  respondent's  case,  his
    position was analogous to that of KH.  It was submitted that  it  could
    not be said that in India his position would be exceptional.

32.   Turning to the article 8  issue,  the  appellant's  argument  can  be
    summarised by reference to the skeleton argument:

         "In the case of N, the court's view was that although it  had  been
         argued that N's right to a private life was engaged, there  was  in
         fact no separate issue under article 8.  In KH, it was accepted on
         behalf of the appellant that it would be  a  very  rare  case  that
         could succeed under article 8 if it failed under article 3.  This
         position was endorsed by Lord Justice Longmore".

    It is accordingly the appellant's position that the respondent had  not
    demonstrated that there was a separate freestanding article 8 issue.

33.   On behalf of  the  respondent  Mr O'Callaghan  provided  grounds  for
    resisting the appeal.  A detailed skeleton argument was provided to  us
    on behalf of the respondent and that was elaborated upon in the  course
    of oral submissions.

34.   Mr O'Callaghan began by submitting that  it  was  the  task  of  this
    tribunal  to  consider  the  lawfulness  and  reasonableness   of   the
    Immigration Judge's decision.  It was not open to  us  to  replace  the
    decision simply because we would have  reached  different  conclusions;
    rather it was required of us to consider whether the Immigration  Judge
    was reasonably entitled to reach the decision he did.  Said  submission
    was made under reference to CA v the Secretary of State  for  the  Home
    Department [2004] INLR 453.

35.   Turning to his detailed rebuttal of the arguments advanced  on  behalf
    of the appellant he began by reminding us  of  the  absolute  terms  of
    article 3.  Given its absolute nature, it was his position that if the
    higher threshold was met,  and  a  breach  would  occur  following  the
    removal of a foreign national from this country, the United Kingdom was
    required under its international obligations to take appropriate  steps
    to prevent such a breach occurring.

36.   Under reference to N v United Kingdom at paragraph 29, he set out the
    nature of ill-treatment when considering article 3:

         "According to the courts  constant  case  law,  ill-treatment  must
         attain a minimal level of severity if it  is  to  fall  within  the
         scope of article 3...The  suffering  which  flows  from  naturally
         occurring illness, physical or mental, maybe covered by article 3,
         where it is, or  risk  being,  exacerbated  by  treatment,  whether
         flowing from conditions of detention, expulsion or other  measures,
         for which the authorities can be held responsible..."

37.   Turning to the jurisprudence of  the  Strasbourg  Court,  he  accepted
    that,  save  in  exceptionally  compelling  cases,   the   humanitarian
    consequences of returning a person to a country where his or her health
    is likely to deteriorate terminally do not place the returning state in
    breach of article 3.  This understanding was most recently  stated  by
    the Grand Chamber in N v United Kingdom:

         "42.     Aliens who are subject to expulsion  cannot  in  principle
             claim  any  entitlement  to  remain  in  the  territory  of  a
             contracting  state  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from
             medical, social or other  forms  of  assistance  and  services
             provided  by  the  expelling  state.   The   fact   that   the
             applicant's  circumstances,  including  his  life  expectancy,
             would be significantly reduced if he were to be  removed  from
             the contracting state is not sufficient in itself to give rise
             to breach of article 3.  The decision to remove an alien  who
             is suffering from a serious mental or physical  illness  to  a
             country where the facilities for the treatment of that illness
             are inferior to those available in the contracting  state  may
             raise an issue under article 3, but only in a very exceptional
             case, where the humanitarian grounds against the  removal  are
             compelling.  In the D case the very exceptional circumstances
             were that the applicant was critically ill and appeared to  be
             close to death, could not be guaranteed any nursing or medical
             care in its country of origin and had no family there  willing
             or able to care for him or provide him with even a basic level
             of food, shelter or social support.


         43.      The court does not exclude that there may  be  other  very
             exceptional cases where the  humanitarian  considerations  are
             equally compelling.  However,  it  considers  that  it  should
             maintain the high threshold set in D v the United Kingdom  and
             applied in its  subsequent  case  law,  which  it  regards  as
             correct in principle, given that in  such  cases  the  alleged
             future harm would emanate not from  the  intentional  acts  or
             omissions of  public  authorities  or  non-state  bodies,  but
             instead from a naturally occurring illness  and  the  lack  of
             sufficient  resources  to  deal  with  it  in  the   receiving
             country".


38.   Turning to  the  issue  of  exceptionality,  counsel  submitted  under
    reference to speech of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead at paragraph 15 and
    Lord Hope of Craighead at paragraph 48 in the N v SSHD case, that the
    exceptionality test is rooted in the humanitarian grounds  against  the
    removal  being  compelling.   However,  there  was  no  "medical  care"
    obligation upon contracting states.

39.   Having set out the legal context within which  the  Immigration  Judge
    required to make his decision, he submitted that the Immigration  Judge
    clearly had the  issue  of  exceptionality  in  mind  when  considering
    whether there had  been  a  breach  of  article 3.   He  directed  our
    attention to certain parts of the determination in terms of  which  the
    Immigration Judge had held that:

    (a)    The respondent's medical condition was extremely grave given the
         prospects of survival  without  the  essential  treatment  that  he
         required.


    (b)    Without dialysis, he would survive for one to two weeks.


    (c)    The immediacy of his death  upon  the  withdrawal  of  treatment
         brought the case within the category of exceptionality contemplated
         by the case of N.

40.    Counsel  went  on  to  say  that  in   considering   the   issue   of
    exceptionality, the Immigration Judge had given careful scrutiny to the
    facts of the case both in the United Kingdom and India.

41.   He argued that the determination of  the  Immigration  Judge  was  not
    speculative, but based upon the  evidence  presented.  The  Immigration
    Judge had carefully considered the notion of  "terminal  illness".   It
    was reasonably open he submitted to the Immigration Judge  to  consider
    circumstances where a person dying within at most two weeks of  medical
    treatment not being provided as being analogous to a terminal  illness.
    The Immigration Judge  further  determined  that  whilst  theoretically
    there may be treatment  available  to  the  respondent  in  India,  the
    practical reality was that there would be no  opportunity  for  him  to
    realistically avail himself  of  the  dialysis  that  is  essential  to
    prevent his early death.

42.   It was counsel's position that the imminence  of  death  entitled  the
    Immigration Judge to place the respondent in an analogous  position  of
    that to Mr D in the D v United Kingdom case rather than the position of
    Miss N in the N v SSHD case who would live for a year or  two  without
    medication.

43.   It was his position that financial  issues  could  properly  be  given
    weight  when  considering  exceptionality.   As  the  Court  of  Appeal
    accepted in DM (Zambia) v Secretary of State for  the  Home  Department
    [2009] EWCA Civ 474 at paragraph 23:

         "...in short the AIT concluded that  she  would,  contrary  to  her
         evidence,  have  familial  and  financial   support   and   so   be
         considerably better placed than many Zambians to continue with  the
         therapy she undoubtedly needs to sustain her health and prolong her
         life.  Against this the AIT were entitled to weigh,  as  they  did,
         the absence of any family life here and the relative paucity of her
         private life..."

44.   The heart of the Immigration Judge's determination counsel argued  was
    this:  knowledge that in reality, within two weeks  of  the  respondent
    flying back to India, he would be dead.  The  accompanying  realisation
    that the withdrawal of medical support, which though unpleasant permits
    some quality of life, would lead to death within a matter of days,  not
    weeks, counsel submitted was significant and gave rise  to  inhumanity.
    It was his position that in all true senses the respondent  was  in  an
    analogous position with a terminally ill  patient,  being  deprived  of
    medication, giving some quality of life through its effects.

45.    Counsel particularly relied on the observations of Baroness Hale  in
    N v  SSHD  where  in  his  submission  she  set  out  what  the  proper
    consideration was in cases such as the instant one:

         "69.     ...whether the applicant's  illness  has  reached  such  a
             critical  stage  (ie  is  dying)  that  it  would  be  inhuman
             treatment to deprive him of the care  which  he  is  currently
             receiving and send him home to an early death unless there  is
             care  available  to  enable  him  to  meet  that   fact   with
             dignity..."

46.   Therefore, for the  foregoing  reasons,  counsel  submitted  that  the
    Immigration  Judge  could  reasonably  and  lawfully  find  that   very
    exceptional circumstances existed in relation  to  the  respondent  and
    accordingly his determination should not be disturbed.

Assessment of whether there is an error of law

47.   The issue in the present appeal is a short and sharp one and is  this:
     was the Immigration Judge  entitled  to  hold  that  the  respondent's
    circumstances placed him in the category of an exceptional  case?   The
    answer to that question is in our opinion no.

48.   In our view, on a proper understanding of  the  N  and  D  cases,  the
    position of the respondent was in all real senses the same  as  Miss N
    and was materially different from the position of Mr D.

49.   The starting  point  in  considering  whether  a  particular  case  is
    exceptional is the case of N.  In that case each of the judges  in  the
    House of Lords reviewed the Strasbourg and domestic  jurisprudence  and
    sought to define the particular circumstances which caused the case  of
    D to be exceptional and therefore made it unacceptable for  him  to  be
    expelled.  They sought in their speeches to distinguish the case  of  D
    from the many other cases where Strasbourg had held  the  circumstances
    were not exceptional.

50.   Lord Nicholls  of  Birkenhead  at  paragraph 13  thereof  asks  this
    question:

         "In D's case, there was the additional feature that  D  was  dying.
         But the appellant's condition in  the  present  case  will  rapidly
         become terminal, as soon  as  her  life  preserving  medication  is
         discontinued.   This  prompts  a  further  question:   why  is   it
         unacceptable to expel a person whose illness  is  irreversible  and
         whose death is near, but acceptable to expel a person whose illness
         is under control but whose death will occur once  treatment  ceases
         (as may well happen on deportation)?"

51.   The first thing to be noted from what is  said  by  Lord Nicholls  of
    Birkenhead there is this:  it is clear that the respondent ( GS) falls
    into the same category as N in that his  illness  is  not  irreversible
    like D's, rather it is presently controlled by dialysis.   In  addition
    like N his death will occur once treatment ceases.

52.   Having posed this question, Lord Nicholls of  Birkenhead  answers  it
    thus at paragraph 15:

         "15.     Is  there,  then,  some  other  rationale  underlying  the
             decisions in the many immigration cases where  the  Strasbourg
             court has distinguished D's case?  I believe  there  is.   The
             essential distinction is  not  to  be  found  in  humanitarian
             differences.  Rather it lies in  recognising  that  article 3
             does  not  require  contracting  states   to   undertake   the
             obligation  of  providing  aliens  indefinitely  with  medical
             treatment lacking in their home countries.  In the case  of  D
             and  in  later  cases  the  Strasbourg  court  has  constantly
             reiterated that  in  principle  aliens  subject  to  expulsion
             cannot claim any entitlement to remain in the territory  of  a
             contracting  state  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from
             medical, social and other forms of assistance provided by  the
             expelling state.  Article 3 imposes no  such  'medical  care'
             obligation on contracting states.  This is so even  where,  in
             the absence of medical treatment, the  life  of  the  would-be
             immigrant will be significantly shortened.  But in the case of
             D, unlike the later cases, there was no question  of  imposing
             any such obligation on the United Kingdom.  D was  dying,  and
             beyond the reach of medical treatment then available".

53.    From  the  observations  of  Lord Nicholls   of   Birkenhead,   the
    circumstance in the case  of  D  which  caused  it  to  fall  into  the
    exceptional category was this:  he was  beyond  the  reach  of  medical
    treatment; he was dying and thus by allowing  him  to  remain  in  this
    country, no medical care obligation was placed on the expelling  state.
    That is not the position of the respondent, GS.  If he continues to  be
    treated in this country by means of dialysis his death will  not  occur
    due to his present medical problems in the foreseeable future.   He  is
    not beyond the reach of  medical  treatment  in  this  country.   Thus,
    unlike D he would not be remaining in this country for a  short  period
    until his imminent death took place.  Rather the respondent  would,  if
    allowed to remain, continue to benefit from the medical treatment which
    he is presently receiving.  It  is  made  clear  by  Lord Nicholls  of
    Birkenhead in the passages in his speech to which we have referred that
    the Strasbourg jurisprudence does not  impose  such  an  obligation  of
    medical care upon the contracting state.  It is in failing to recognise
    this critical  distinction  that  the  Immigration  Judge  has  made  a
    fundamental error of law.

54.   That the foregoing is  a  correct  understanding  of  their  Lordships
    decision in N v SSHD is  reinforced  by  reference  to  the  speech  of
    Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood at paragraphs 86 and 87:

         "86.     The unmistakable conclusion to be drawn from  this  series
             of recent decisions is that the Court has  adopted  the  clear
             stance that article 3 is not breached by the return of an AIDS
             sufferer to his or her  home  country  save  in  circumstances
             closely comparable to those in D itself.


         87.      This is not perhaps surprising.  D represented, as Laws LJ
             below observed, "an extension of an extension to the article 3
             obligation".  The Court in Bensaid (para 40)  spoke  of  "the
             high threshold set by article 3, particularly where the  case
             does not concern the direct responsibility of the  Contracting
             State for the infliction of harm".

55.   His Lordship goes on to say at paragraph 90:

         "90.     As  already  indicated,  my  clear  understanding  of  the
             subsequent Strasbourg case law  is  that  the  Court  has  now
             adopted 'a restrictive line'.  It has  not  been  prepared  to
             grant 'an absolute right for seriously ill persons  to  remain
             in the host  country  to  get  treatment,  provided  they  had
             managed  to  set  foot  there.'    The   'very   far-reaching'
             consequences of such a  right  would  give  rise  to  positive
             obligations which the Court has not thought it right to impose
             upon the Contracting States."

56.   Having reviewed the Strasbourg jurisprudence his Lordship goes  on  to
    consider what made the case of D exceptional and says at  paragraph 93
    the following:

         "93.     The logical distinction between  the  two  very  different
             scenarios presented respectively by D and the later  cases  is
             surely this.  D appeared to be close to death; paragraph 21 of
             the Court's judgment there records  that  at  the  hearing  on
             20 February 1997:  "according to his counsel, it would appear
             that the applicant's life was drawing to a close much  as  the
             experts had predicted" (a medical report of June 1996  having
             stated that D's prognosis was limited to  8-12  months).   The
             critical question there was  accordingly  where  and  in  what
             circumstances D should die rather than where  he  should  live
             and be treated.  D really did concern what was  principally  a
             negative obligation, not to deport D to  an  imminent,  lonely
             and distressing end.  Not so the more recent  cases  including
             the present one.  Given the enormous advances in medicine, the
             focus  now  is  rather  on  the  length  and  quality  of  the
             applicant's life than the particular circumstances of  his  or
             her death.  In these cases, therefore, the  real  question  is
             whether the State is under a positive obligation  to  continue
             treatment on a long-term basis.  It is precisely in this  type
             of case that the Court's statement in D (para 54), that those
             subject to removal "cannot in principle claim any  entitlement
             to remain on the territory of a Contracting State in order  to
             continue to benefit from medical, social  or  other  forms  of
             assistance provided by the expelling  state",  has  particular
             application."

57.   Thus, in paragraph 93 his Lordship draws the exact same conclusion as
    Lord Nicholls as to what made the case of D exceptional.  In particular
    we note that he says that the critical question was this:  where and in
    what circumstances D should die rather that where he should live and be
    treated?

58.   Baroness Hale of Richmond, in her speech  makes  the  same  point  at
    paragraphs 68 and 69.

59.   Having regard to the observations set forth in the case of  N  v  SSHD
    by the House of Lords as we have above set out, we are clear  that  the
    Immigration Judge has erred in  law.   We  are  in  no  doubt  that  as
    submitted by Mr O'Callaghan, he had in mind the test of exceptionality
    when  considering  the  case.   However,  he  has   in   our   judgment
    misunderstood the case  of  N  v  SSHD  and  the  preceding  Strasbourg
    jurisprudence.

60.   On a proper understanding of the law, the respondent's  case  was  not
    exceptional.  He was not in circumstances which were closely comparable
    to D.  Rather his position was analogous to N's and therefore the  test
    is not satisfied.  The Immigration Judge  has  wrongly  held  that  the
    circumstances of the respondent were analogous to that of  D.   He  has
    erred in law by failing to understand that article 3 does not impose a
    medical care obligation on the contracting state.  The clear result  of
    allowing the respondent to remain in this country would  be  to  impose
    such an obligation on the United  Kingdom.   The  essential  difference
    between the case before him and the case of  D  which  the  Immigration
    Judge has failed to understand is that in the case of D  no  such  care
    obligation would be imposed upon the contracting  state  as  no  matter
    what medical treatment D was offered he would die within a  very  short
    time.  Thus, the respondent, GS is not in the same position as  D.   He
    accordingly does not on a proper understanding of the law fall into the
    exceptional category.  In these circumstances the Immigration Judge has
    made a material error of law and we therefore re-make the decision.

Decision


61.   No one could  fail  to  be  moved  by  the  respondent's  predicament,
    however, for the reasons we have stated above, there is  no  breach  of
    article 3.

62.   For the reasons advanced on behalf of  the  appellant,  we  hold  that
    there was no  breach  of  article 8.   In  his  skeleton  argument  at
    paragraph 24, it appears to be  broadly  accepted  on  behalf  of  the
    respondent that if he failed in relation to  his  article 3  claim  he
    could not be successful in terms of article 8 and with that concession
    we agree.

63.   For the above reasons  the  determination  of  the  Immigration  Judge
    cannot stand and we find in favour of the  appellant.   We  accordingly
    remake the decision  and  hold  that  there  is  no  breach  of  either
    article 3 or 8 of the ECHR.
