Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr J McGirr, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms A Broome, Solicitor


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Although the appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State,
    it is convenient to refer to the parties as they were before the First-
    tier Tribunal ("FtT").

 2. The appellant is a citizen  of  Albania,  born  in  1980.   He  arrived
    illegally in the UK on 4 January 2000 and claimed asylum.  That  asylum
    claim was refused and  a  subsequent  appeal  was  dismissed.   He  was
    removed to Albania on 2 September 2003  but  on  an  unknown  date  re-
    entered and claimed asylum on 25 February 2004.  The  claim  was  again
    refused and he was removed to Albania on 4 March 2004.

 3. On 2 September 2004 he was encountered at Newcastle  Airport  whereupon
    he presented an Italian identity card  and  again  claimed  asylum  but
    withdrew the claim.  On 6  September  2004  he  was  again  removed  to
    Albania.  He was next encountered on 22 September 2012 in an HGV  by  a
    custom's officer at Dover and was removed to Albania,  for  the  fourth
    time, on 2 October 2012.

 4. On 22 May 2015 in the Crown Court at Birmingham  he  was  convicted  of
    conspiracy  to  supply  Class  A  drugs  and  received  a  sentence  of
    imprisonment which was reduced on appeal on 5 December  2016  to  three
    years and nine months' imprisonment.

 5. The respondent accepts that the appellant is a family member of an  EEA
    national.  A  decision  to  deport  him  pursuant  to  the  Immigration
    (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006 ("the EEA  Regulations")  was
    made on 22 December 2016.

 6. The appellant appealed against that decision and his appeal came before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge V. A. Cox ("the  FtJ")  on  7  February  2018
    whereby the appeal was allowed under the EEA  Regulations.  Aside  from
    appealing under the EEA Regulations against  the  deportation  decision
    the appellant advanced an appeal on asylum grounds.  However,  the  FtJ
    dismissed that appeal.  There is  no  cross-appeal  on  behalf  of  the
    appellant in relation to that matter.

 7. The respondent's application for permission  to  appeal  to  the  Upper
    Tribunal was in fact out of time.  There  was  no  application  for  an
    extension of time and there was no explanation for the delay in  making
    the application.  Nevertheless, time was extended by the Upper Tribunal
    Judge who granted permission.

 8. No point was taken on behalf of  the  appellant  in  relation  to  that
    issue, my having raised it with the parties at the hearing.  Mr  McGirr
    explained that it appeared that the FtJ's decision on  the  appeal  was
    sent to the Home Office in Birmingham whereas it should have been  sent
    to Fleetbank House in London and, it was suggested, the application for
    permission was in fact lodged on the 14th day after it was received  at
    Fleetbank House.

 9. In the circumstances, it is not necessary to say  anything  further  in
    relation to the issue of the grant of permission.

10. I summarise the grounds of appeal and the parties' submissions.

    The grounds and submissions

11. The respondent relies on the decision in Kamki v Secretary of State for
    the Home Department [2017] EWCA Civ 1715 on the  issue  of  reoffending
    and the seriousness of the consequences if there is  such  reoffending.
    Reference is made in the grounds to  the  OASys  report  in  which  the
    appellant admits to being easily influenced.   Thus,  it  is  suggested
    that he would be tempted to reoffend if presented with the same chances
    and the consequences would be very serious indeed, as reflected in  the
    sentencing judge's remarks.

12. So far as the sentencing remarks are concerned, those showed  that  the
    appellant played a significant role in what would otherwise have been a
    successful supply of a large quantity of heroin  into  Birmingham,  had
    the police not intervened.  The appellant was to receive �163,500  from
    the offence and if he were to have financial  problems  the  temptation
    would still exist.

13. The grounds  contend  that  the  respondent's  decision  was  "entirely
    proportionate".  The appellant's residence in the UK  had  been  mostly
    illegal and he had not demonstrated any integration into the  UK.   His
    immigration history reflected a lack  of  regard  for  UK  law  by  re-
    entering on numerous occasions illegally  and  using  false  documents.
    There was no  evidence  of  rehabilitation.   The  appellant  was  only
    entitled to the lowest level of protection against  removal  under  the
    EEA Regulations.  Because of the international organised crime  element
    the respondent's decision "is definitely proportional" for someone with
    no children, no permanent right of residence and who is not  integrated
    into the UK.

14. Although the FtJ considered that there was integration, he  had  failed
    to make a holistic assessment of the  time  spent  in  the  UK  by  the
    appellant, it is said.  There was no "qualitative assessment accounting
    for the  appellant's  behaviour,  conduct  and  the  substance  of  his
    residency".

15. The FtJ had referred to the appellant having "enhanced  protection"  as
    an EEA national.  However, it had already been stated by the  FtJ  that
    the appellant had not acquired a permanent right of  residence.   Thus,
    it was not clear what the FtJ meant by  enhanced  protection.   It  was
    clear that he had not acquired a permanent right of residence.

16. Although the FtJ found that  the  appellant  had  a  better  chance  of
    rehabilitation in the UK,  in  MC  (Essa  principles  recast)  Portugal
    [2015] UKUT 00520 (IAC) it states that substantial weight should not be
    given to the prospects of rehabilitation when the EEA national has  not
    acquired permanent residence.  That was the situation here.

17. In his submissions  Mr  McGirr  relied  on  the  written  grounds.   He
    referred me to various aspects of the OASys report in  support  of  the
    submission that the FtJ had  not  considered  that  report  in  detail.
    Thus, the OASys report showed on page 12 that it  was  the  appellant's
    lack of finances that prompted  his  involvement  in  the  offence,  he
    having expected to have been paid �163,500.  On page 14 of  the  report
    it referred to his being easily influenced, having significant problems
    in terms  of  recklessness  and  risk-taking  behaviour  and  that  his
    lifestyle and associates  were  linked  to  offending  behaviour.   The
    report also referred on page 18 to his having some  problems  with  the
    ability to recognise problems, and  significant  problems  in  problem-
    solving skills and awareness of consequences.  It  was  submitted  that
    the overall picture from the OASys report was that  the  appellant  has
    poor  judgement,  is  easily  influenced  and  mixes  in   a   criminal
    environment.  The FtJ had failed to  pay  sufficient  regard  to  those
    aspects of the report.

18. The appellant had become a police informant but that had resulted in  a
    reduction in his sentence.  He had received preferential conditions and
    treatment in prison.

19. So far as integration is concerned, the FtJ had found  that  after  his
    marriage he had  started  integrating,  despite  his  poor  immigration
    history.  However, that was during  the  time  he  was  involved  in  a
    serious criminal activity.  The architect of the offending  appears  to
    have been in prison and the appellant would  have  known  that  dealing
    with such a person would mean that he was not integrating.  The FtJ had
    failed to take that into account.

20. It was submitted that in allowing the appeal the FtJ  did  not  take  a
    rational approach to all the  evidence  and  misinterpreted  the  OASys
    report.  Although the report states that the appellant is at a low risk
    of reoffending, low risk is still a risk.

21. In her submissions Ms Broome referred me  to  various  aspects  of  the
    FtJ's decision in support of the argument that the FtJ  had  considered
    all the relevant aspects of the appellant's circumstances.  At [94] the
    FtJ had pointed out that there was no evidence from the  respondent  to
    refute the assessment of low risk of reoffending  as  set  out  in  the
    OASys report.  The FtJ referred at [97] to there having been no  breach
    of the appellant's licence, and he dealt with integration from [86].

    Assessment and Conclusions

22. It was agreed by the parties before the FtJ, and accepted by him,  that
    the appellant had received a reduction in his sentence because  he  had
    been a  police  informant.   Nothing  specific  turns  on  that  issue,
    although it is part of the background to the appeal in the  sense  that
    it helps to explain the sentence that  was  imposed  on  the  appellant
    which  was  originally  a  sentence  of  six  years  and  nine  months'
    imprisonment, varied on appeal to three years and nine months.

23. It is also worth pointing out that in relation to his assessment of the
    asylum ground of appeal the FtJ concluded that  the  appellant's  claim
    was not credible,  and  that  it  was  "littered  with  incredible  and
    implausible suggestions and supposition". At  [67]  he  said  that  the
    appellant's account of a fear of persecution is "incredible  and  is  a
    fabrication designed to gain access to the United Kingdom".  I  mention
    those matters because they indicate that the FtJ did not blindly accept
    everything that the appellant asserted.

24. As regards the seriousness of the offence, he said  at  [49]  that  the
    appellant was a trusted and reasonably senior member  of  the  criminal
    organisation which was involved in the offence.  He made those  remarks
    in the context of the appellant's claim that he would  be  at  risk  on
    return to Albania as a police informant.

25. In the respondent's grounds it states that "it is  not  clear  what  is
    meant by his finding...[the]  appellant  does  not  have  any  enhanced
    protection as an EEA national". That  appears  to  relate  to  the  FtJ
    having said at  [112]  that  the  appellant  "can  claim  the  enhanced
    protection against deportation  as  an  EEA  national".   That  is  the
    penultimate paragraph of  his  assessment  of  the  issues  before  his
    stating that the appeal under the EEA Regulations was allowed.

26. In isolation, one can see that what the FtJ said there could  be  taken
    to mean that  he  found  that  the  appellant  had  protection  against
    deportation other than the 'base level' protection, that is that he has
    acquired a permanent right of residence meaning that he could  only  be
    deported on serious grounds of public policy  or  public  security,  or
    that he had protection against deportation because of residence in  the
    UK for a period of at least ten years, thus preventing his  deportation
    on anything other than imperative grounds of public security.

27. However, it is abundantly  plain  from  the  FtJ's  decision  that  his
    reference to "enhanced protection" was a reference  to  the  protection
    afforded to an EEA national or family member of the same which  extends
    beyond the protections that would be afforded to a non-EEA national  or
    family member.  So much is plain from, for example, [70] where the  FtJ
    said  that  the  EEA  Regulations  means  that  a  different  level  of
    protection exists for EEA nationals and their family members  and  that
    the appellant is not  treated  as  a  "foreign  criminal"  (within  the
    meaning of s.117D of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act  2002
    ("the 2002 Act")) and that the assessment of threat must be as  in  the
    EEA Regulations.

28. Similarly, it is evident that the FtJ assessed the level of  protection
    afforded to the appellant against deportation under the EEA Regulations
    entirely correctly.  At [12] he recorded that it was agreed  on  behalf
    of the appellant that his wife had not achieved five years'  continuous
    residence such as to acquire a permanent  right  of  residence,  albeit
    that she was a qualified person.  Again, at [70] he said  that  it  was
    agreed before him that the  appellant's  wife  had  not  exercised  her
    Treaty rights for a continuous  period  of  five  years  and  thus  the
    appellant had not acquired a permanent right of residence.  At [72]  he
    said that he must consider if the  appellant's  conduct  satisfied  the
    relevant public policy criteria "not the more stringent one  applicable
    to those with a right of permanent residence".

29. Accordingly,  there  is  no  merit  in  the  contention  that  the  FtJ
    misunderstood the basis upon which the appellant  was  able  to  resist
    deportation under the EEA Regulations.

30. The argument that the FtJ failed to undertake a proper appraisal of the
    risk of the appellant's reoffending is also without merit.  At [71]  he
    said that even a low risk can constitute a "present threat"  especially
    if the consequence of the offending could be serious.   That  precisely
    reflects the proposition  advanced  in  the  respondent's  grounds'  in
    reliance on the decision in Kamki.  Furthermore, at [102] the FtJ  said
    that when he was looking at reoffending he must also have in  mind  the
    seriousness of the consequences if he  did  reoffend,  there  referring
    directly to Kamki.  He also said  that  "[d]rug  taking  (sic)  is  not
    victimless as the Respondent rightly sets out. He was  there  no  doubt
    referring to drug supplying and agreeing  with  what  is  said  by  the
    respondent in the decision letter about the  very  harmful  effects  of
    drug supplying.

31. It is further apparent that the FtJ undertook a careful  assessment  of
    the extent of the risk of  reoffending.   At  [88]  he  said  that  the
    appellant had shown a cavalier and unacceptable attitude to  rules  and
    boundaries of UK society, and that it did not matter to him whether  or
    not he had the right to enter the UK.  He said that he had a history of
    entering as he pleased, then working unlawfully and  then  deciding  to
    commit crime when he needed  money.   He  referred  to  the  amount  of
    �163,500 that the appellant was to be paid for his part in the criminal
    activity.

32. At [90] the FtJ said, correctly, that the  threat  that  the  appellant
    posed must be serious enough to effect one of the fundamental interests
    of society, and that the threat needed to be sufficiently  serious.  At
    [89] he said that he had to consider the impact of the offence and  the
    significant number of victims affected by the "importation" of Class  A
    drugs. He went on to conclude that that was a matter that  was  plainly
    contrary to the  fundamental  interest  of  maintaining  public  order,
    preventing social harm and protecting the public.

33. He referred to the burden being on the respondent to prove the level of
    threat and that it was genuine, present and sufficiently  serious.   At
    [94] he said that the  respondent  did  not  provide  any  satisfactory
    evidence to refute the assessment of  risk  in  the  OASys  report,  no
    updating information having been provided.  It is to be noted that  the
    OASys report indicated that the risk of reoffending was low.

34. Further in relation to the OASys report he said at [98] that it is  not
    a wholly positive document.  He also noted that it identified  some  of
    the  appellant's  answers  as  indicating  that  some  aspects  of  the
    assessment were negative.  He referred in that same  paragraph  to  his
    problem-solving skills scoring "highly against him".   He  referred  to
    the  appellant's  acceptance  of  the  motivation  for  offending,  his
    propensity to be depressed and bored.  At [99] the FtJ said that a full
    consideration  of  the  OASys  report  showed  an  acceptance  of  some
    weaknesses by the appellant.  He further stated that the fact  that  he
    was "assessed as low risk" did not  automatically  entitle  him  to  be
    considered as no risk or as someone that does  not  present  a  present
    threat.  That was but part of the picture to be considered, he said.

35. It was not necessary for the FtJ to refer to every aspect of the  OASys
    report which touched on the issue of the risk  of  reoffending.   Quite
    apart from the fact that a judge does not need to refer to every  piece
    of evidence, all the matters to which I was referred on behalf  of  the
    respondent in submissions were  part  of  the  OASys  assessment  which
    culminated in a conclusion that the risk of reoffending  was  low.   In
    any event, the FtJ plainly did consider the OASys report as is  evident
    from his summary of aspects of it.  Accordingly, I do not  accept  that
    the FtJ's conclusions were flawed for want of consideration, or correct
    appreciation of, the import of the OASys report.  He referred  to  that
    report at [83], [94], [95], [98], [99] and [103].

36. Similarly, the FtJ undertook a detailed  assessment  of  the  issue  of
    integration.  At [85] he correctly identified that it was not  possible
    to integrate into UK society whilst imprisoned.  In the same  paragraph
    he concluded that the appellant had, to his mid-30's, led a  life  that
    involved him simply doing as he wished with an almost  total  disregard
    for others, but that he was a family member of an EEA citizen once they
    married and he had thereafter been able  to  demonstrate  a  period  of
    integration.  That was  a  conclusion  that  he  developed  from  [86],
    although rejecting any suggestion that he could have integrated  whilst
    he was offending.

37. At [87] he referred to letters from some friends  about  his  place  in
    their lives in UK society, stating that he attached "some small  amount
    of weight" to them.

38. Thus, it is apparent that the FtJ recognised  the  limitations  on  the
    extent of the appellant's integration but did not rule out  that  there
    was some degree of integration, for the reasons he explained.

39. At [104] he concluded that although the appellant had been convicted of
    a serious offence, he had good prospects  of  rehabilitation  and  that
    such prospects are poor in the less regulated society in Albania  where
    corruption was a concern.  He took into account in that paragraph  that
    there was no real risk of reoffending.  The only point made  on  behalf
    of the respondent in the grounds  in  relation  to  the  rehabilitation
    issue concerns the lack of weight to be afforded to  the  prospects  of
    rehabilitation when a person has not  acquired  a  permanent  right  of
    residence as in the case of this appellant.  However, there is  nothing
    to indicate that  the  FtJ  accorded  substantial  or  disproportionate
    weight to the issue of rehabilitation.

40. So far as proportionality is concerned, the respondent's grounds really
    do demonstrate that the complaint about the FtJ's decision  is  nothing
    more than a disagreement with his conclusions.  Thus,  it  is  asserted
    that the respondent considered her  decision  "entirely  proportionate"
    and that "the respondent's decision is definitely proportional".

41. At [72] the FtJ recognised that there needed to an  assessment  of  the
    proportionality of the decision and at [74] that he needed  to  balance
    "a number of factors" in coming to  his  decision.  At  [75]  he  again
    reminded himself that the decision must be proportionate and  based  on
    the facts of the  case  and  the  appellant's  conduct,  and  that  his
    criminal past does not in itself justify the decision.

42. I cannot see that there is any factor that the FtJ failed to take  into
    account in his decision.  The express or implied suggestion that he had
    not fully considered the seriousness of the offence is simply not borne
    out, the FtJ having referred on several occasions to the seriousness of
    the appellant's criminality and his disregard for UK law  in  terms  of
    his very poor immigration history.

43. Quite apart from  anything  else,  once  the  FtJ  concluded  that  the
    appellant did not represent a genuine and present threat, i.e. that  he
    did  not  present  as  other  than  a  low  risk  of  reoffending,  but
    recognising that a low risk was still a risk, the outcome of the appeal
    could have been nothing  other  than  a  decision  in  the  appellant's
    favour.  As I have already indicated, there is no legal  error  in  the
    FtJ's assessment of this issue.

44. It was entirely accurate for the  FtJ  to  point  out  the  appellant's
    cavalier and unacceptable  attitude  to  rules  and  boundaries  of  UK
    society, and that it did not matter to him whether or not  he  had  the
    right to enter the UK, entering as he pleased, then working  unlawfully
    and then deciding to commit crime when he needed  money.  But  for  the
    difference between the deportation regimes that apply to  EEA  citizens
    or family members of EEA citizens and that  which  applies  to  non-EEA
    citizens or family members, it is very  doubtful  that  this  appellant
    would have succeeded  in  an  appeal  against  deportation.  The  FtJ's
    decision was made within the  legal  framework  that  applied  to  this
    appellant.

45. There is no error of law in the FtJ's decision. His decision  to  allow
    the appeal under the EEA Regulations must therefore stand.




    Decision

46. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the  making  of
    an error on a point of law.  Its decision to allow the appeal stands.


Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

I make an anonymity order because  of  what  is  said  about  the  appellant
having been a police informant. Therefore, unless and until  a  Tribunal  or
court directs otherwise, the appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of
these proceedings shall directly or indirectly identify him  or  any  member
of his family.  This direction applies both to  the  appellant  and  to  the
respondent.  Failure to comply with this direction could  lead  to  contempt
of court proceedings.







Upper Tribunal Judge Kopieczek  Date:    08/02/2019
