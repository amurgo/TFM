Representation:
For the Appellants:    Mr R. Layne of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I. Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS
The Appellants

1.   The Appellant is a citizen of Nigeria born  on  28th  July  1967.   His
    wife ("Mrs Onasile") was born on 9th September 1980 and the couple have
    three children Grace born 24th October 2006  Michael  born  29th  April
    2004 and Benedict born 15th April 2010.  All five members of the family
    appealed against decisions of the Respondent dated 10th March  2014  to
    refuse to grant them leave outside the Immigration Rules and to  remove
    them.  The Appellant's appeal was allowed by Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Hussain sitting at Richmond on 23rd July 2014 who  also  found
    that the other family members had  no  valid  appeal.   The  Respondent
    appeals with leave  against  the  decision  to  allow  the  Appellant's
    appeal.  For the reasons which I have set out below (see paragraphs  24
    to 29) I have set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  as  it
    involved the making of an error of law and I have remade  the  decision
    in this case.  I therefore will refer  to  the  parties  as  they  were
    referred to at first instance.

2.   The Appellant was issued with a multivisit visa on 23rd  December  2004
    valid until 23rd December 2006.  He entered the United Kingdom on  14th
    January 2005.  On  13th  July  2005  Mrs  Onasile  was  issued  with  a
    multivisit visa valid until 13th January 2006.  On 24th August 2005 she
    and Michael entered the United Kingdom.  At some  point  the  Appellant
    left the United Kingdom but returned on  18th  August  2006.   On  24th
    October 2006 the Appellant's daughter Grace was  born.   The  Appellant
    appears to have made two further visits from the United Kingdom in 2006
    finally leaving Nigeria on 10th December  2006.   On  15th  April  2010
    Benedict was born.

3.   On 4th April 2012 the Appellants' former  representative  submitted  an
    application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom on the  basis  of
    family life.  This application was refused by  the  Respondent  on  6th
    June 2013 initially with no right of appeal. That was  reconsidered  by
    the Respondent and  on  10th  March  2014  the  Respondent  issued  the
    decisions, the appeals against which have given  rise  to  the  present
    proceedings.

4.   The appeals of Mrs Onasile and the children came on the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge  Birrell  on  9th  April  2014  to  ascertain
    whether they had a  right  of  appeal  against  the  decisions  of  the
    Respondent.  Judge Birrell held that there was no such right of  appeal
    in-country unless the Appellants had made an  asylum  or  human  rights
    claim before receiving the decision appealed against.  Although all the
    Appellants raised human  rights  issues  in  their  Grounds  of  Appeal
    against the Respondent's  decisions  there  was  nothing  before  Judge
    Birrell to show that a human rights issue had been raised prior to  the
    Respondent's decisions.  The  Judge  held  that  Mrs  Onasile  and  the
    children did not have an in-country right of appeal.

5.   This decision was discussed before Judge  Hussain  who  noted  that  no
    further representations had been made to  the  Tribunal  following  the
    issue of Judge Birrell's decision.  Judge Hussain held at  paragraph  6
    of his determination that:

         "It is not open to  me  to  reopen  the  question  of  whether  the
         Appellant's family members have a valid appeal before this Tribunal
         that issue having already been decided by Judge Birrell  if  it  is
         now contended that that decision is  wrong  then  the  remedy  lies
         elsewhere".

6.   Judge Hussain thereafter went on to deal with the claim  on  the  basis
    that the Appellant was the sole Appellant in the case although  he  did
    take into account the Article 8 rights of  the  other  family  members.
    When he came to issue his determination dated 3rd October 2014 he  only
    referred to the Appellant in the heading to his  determination  on  the
    basis that he did not have valid  appeals  before  him  for  the  other
    family members. There was  no  cross  appeal  against  Judge  Hussain's
    confirmation of Judge Birrell's decision and I too  only  refer  to  Mr
    Onasile as the Appellant. However as the issue was also  raised  before
    me I do explain my decision below (see paragraphs 20 to 23).

The Appellant's Claim

7.   Judge Hussain summarised the Appellants' claim at paragraph  7  of  his
    determination as follows:

         "The basis  of  the  Appellants'  claim  for  leave  to  remain  as
         originally put in the letter dated 21st March 2012 from  Right  Way
         Solicitors appears in substance to be  that  the  Appellant  enjoys
         family  life  with  his  wife  and  children  and   it   would   be
         disproportionate to interfere with that by their removal from  this
         country.  It was also asserted that the Appellant has lived in  the
         United Kingdom for over ten years, he had no criminal record, he is
         a Christian, has formed relationships with others in his church and
         has other ties in the community."

The Refusal

8.   The Respondent refused the application noting that the  Appellant,  his
    wife and children were not United Kingdom nationals nor  settled  here.
    Returning them together to Nigeria would  not  be  a  breach  of  their
    family life.  The Respondent considered her duty under  Section  55  of
    the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration  Act  2009  to  safeguard  and
    promote the welfare of  children.   Grace  suffered  from  sickle  cell
    anaemia and had been receiving treatment under the NHS to which she was
    not entitled.  In any event treatment for that condition was  available
    in Nigeria according to the Country of Origin Information Report.   She
    would be able to access that healthcare on return to  Nigeria  and  the
    Appellant's children would have access to education there.

9.   Since Michael, Grace and Benedict were under 18 their position fell  to
    be considered under paragraph  276ADE(iv)  of  the  Immigration  Rules.
    This sets out the requirements to be met by a person seeking to  remain
    on the grounds of private life, specifically in the  case  of  a  child
    that they have lived here for at least seven years and it would not  be
    reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United  Kingdom.  Benedict
    was born on 15th April 2010 and had thus not lived continuously in  the
    United Kingdom for at least seven years.  Michael was born  in  Nigeria
    but entered the United Kingdom with his mother on 24th August 2005 (and
    thus had lived in this country for more than seven years) and Grace was
    born in the United Kingdom on 24th October  2006  (and  thus  had  also
    spent more than seven years in this country by the date of decision).

10.  However no evidence had  been  submitted  to  show  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect the children to return  to  Nigeria  with  their
    family and therefore they failed to  meet  paragraph  276ADE(iv).   The
    Appellant and his family  may  have  formed  a  private  life  but  the
    overwhelming majority of this was established at a time when  they  had
    no leave to remain and were aware they could be removed  at  any  time.
    Grace's medical condition did  not  reach  the  high  threshold  for  a
    finding that Article 3 was engaged following  the  case  of  N  v  SSHD
    [2005] UKHL 31.

The Hearing at First Instance

11.  The Judge heard evidence from the Appellant and his wife who  described
    their family life.  Michael would  miss  his  friends  he  had  met  if
    returned to Nigeria.  Grace had health issues.   The  public  education
    system in Nigeria was bad,  30%  of  the  school  stayed  closed.   The
    healthcare system was also bad.  When Grace was born the Appellant  was
    told by the doctors caring for her that he should ensure that Grace had
    treatment in an advanced country.  The Appellant himself did not  work,
    the church provided his rent and he was helped by friends  and  family.
    Even if he put the children into a private school in Nigeria they would
    have to come back to the community.  The Appellant's father, mother and
    two siblings were still in Nigeria and the  Appellant's  wife  had  her
    father and siblings.  The family were still in contact with his  wife's
    parents.  Mrs Onasile said  that  Grace  had  been  admitted  again  to
    hospital as recently as April 2014.  In the summer she had to be  taken
    to hospital more frequently because she was allergic to the heat.   Her
    case was reviewed every six months by the doctors.   The  school  which
    Grace attended had on several occasions  called  Mrs  Onasile  to  pick
    Grace up.  A Nigerian school would not do that for the  family.   Grace
    was an exceptionally talented reader and was two  years  ahead  of  her
    age.

12.  The Respondent cited the case of Azimi-Moayed [2013]  UKUT  before  the
    Judge in particular subparagraph  (iv) of the  headnote  which  stated:
    "iv) Apart from the terms of published policies and rules, the Tribunal
    notes that seven years from age four is likely to be  more  significant
    to a child than the first seven years of his life.  Very young children
    are  focussed  on  their  parents  rather  than  their  peers  and  are
    adaptable".  It  was  the  Judge's  view  (see  paragraph  33  of   his
    determination) that the Appellant's son Michael had the strongest  case
    under paragraph 276ADE(iv).  He had continuously lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom since August 2005 and had made no return trips to Nigeria.  The
    Judge stated at paragraph 38: "His ties to that country  therefore  are
    merely cultural and ancestral".  Michael  appeared  to  be  doing  well
    academically and played an important role in the  life  of  his  church
    which he very much enjoyed.  He had taken a  lead  role  in  the  drama
    group of his church.  It was unreasonable to expect  Michael  to  leave
    the United Kingdom and go and live in Nigeria a country with  which  he
    had limited ties.

13.  Removing Michael would interfere with the Appellant's family life  with
    him.  At paragraph 42 the Judge carried out the balancing exercise  and
    placed weight on the fact that family life with Michael  had  not  been
    formed whilst he was illegally  here  or  with  precarious  immigration
    status because the family life had existed  since  Michael's  birth  in
    Nigeria.  The legitimate aim of immigration  control  did  not  require
    Michael's expulsion from the United Kingdom and consequently the appeal
    was allowed under Article 8.



The Onward Appeal

14.   The  Respondent  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that  the
    Tribunal had erred in its approach to Article 8.  No consideration  had
    been given to the provisions of Sections 117A to B of the  Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.   Further  the  Article  8  assessment
    could, pursuant to the case of  Gulshan  [2013]  UKUT  00640,  only  be
    carried out where there were compelling circumstances not recognised by
    the Immigration Rules.   In  this  case  the  Tribunal  had  failed  to
    identify why the Appellant's circumstances were so compelling that they
    amounted to exceptional circumstances outside  the  Immigration  Rules.
    The Tribunal had not followed this approach and thereby had erred.

15.  The Tribunal had also erred in  their  assessment  of  whether  it  was
    reasonable to expect Michael to leave the United  Kingdom.   Whilst  he
    had been here since August 2005 no consideration had been paid  to  the
    fact that he  would  be  returning  with  his  family.  He  would  have
    knowledge of the culture and customs of Nigeria as he would  have  been
    raised in a Nigerian household.  Whilst he may  not  have  returned  to
    Nigeria since 2005 English was spoken in Nigeria and there would be  no
    language barrier against his reintegration.  He had yet  to  begin  his
    secondary education.  Should there be any  problems  the  family  would
    have the support  of  the  extended  family  in  Nigeria.   They  could
    continue their activities with another church in Nigeria.

16.  The Respondent cited the case of EV Philippines [2014] EWCA Civ 874,  a
    case where none of the family were British citizens and  none  had  the
    right to remain in this country.  It was held that if the parents  were
    removed it was entirely reasonable to expect the children  to  go  with
    them.  The desirability of being educated  at  public  expense  in  the
    United Kingdom could not  outweigh  the  benefit  to  the  children  of
    remaining with their parents, the  court  adding  "just  as  we  cannot
    provide medical treatment for the  world  so  we  cannot  educated  the
    world".

17.  The  Tribunal  had  failed  to  consider  that  the  education  of  the
    Appellant's children would be a burden on public resources  and  little
    weight should be given to any private life established at a  time  when
    the Appellants were here unlawfully.  The support he received from  his
    church was precarious and might not continue.  The  Appellant  and  his
    family had already been enjoying public services they were not entitled
    to and had thus been a burden on taxpayers  and  it  would  be  in  the
    public interest to remove them.

18.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Lever on 17th  November  2014.   In  granting
    permission to appeal he wrote:

         "The Judge had focused on the position  of  the  [Appellant's]  son
         Michael and appears to have  made  his  decisions  upon  the  whole
         family based upon some aspects  of  Michael's  case  in  particular
         education.  There is no consideration  by  the  Judge  as  to  what
         compelling or exceptional  circumstances  led  to  a  consideration
         outside of the Rules.  There is no reference to the provisions  and
         matters raised under Section 117 of the 2002 Act, pertinent to this
         case as it relies  on  private  life.   Insofar  as  it  relies  on
         education there appears to be little analysis of proportionality or
         regard to those cases that have looked at the question of education
         under Article 8.  There are a number of arguable errors of  law  in
         this case".

19.  The Appellant responded to the decision to grant permission to  appeal.
     The Judge had  clearly  referred  to  the  Immigration  Rules  in  his
    determination at paragraphs 45 and 46 and confirmed that  the  children
    satisfied the Rules.  The Respondent had made no reference to the facts
    asserted by the Judge but rather selectively picked those which  suited
    the Respondent's argument.  The Respondent failed  to  follow  her  own
    policy regarding the assessment of private life under paragraph 276ADE.
     She was aware that two of the children of  the  Respondent  Grace  and
    Michael had lived continuously in the United Kingdom in  the  last  ten
    years since 2005.  The determination of Judge Hussain was in accordance
    with the law and should stand.

The Preliminary Issue

20.  Counsel for the Appellants raised a preliminary issue at the outset  of
    the hearing that there appeared to have been two determinations in this
    case.  There was a determination dated 3rd October 2014 (which  was  on
    the court file) but the Appellants' solicitors had also  been  sent  an
    earlier determination dated  29th  September  2014  which  differed  in
    certain material respects from the determination  of  the  3rd  October
    2014.  In the September determination Judge Hussain had named all  five
    Appellants and held that they did have a valid right of appeal  whereas
    in the later October 2014  determination  he  had  only  mentioned  the
    Appellant Mr Adebola  Onasile  and  had  refused  to  depart  from  the
    decision of Judge Birrell.

21.  For the Respondent it was argued that there was no  evidence  that  the
    September 2014 determination had been served on  the  Respondent.   The
    Respondent had  appealed  the  determination  of  October  2014.   That
    determination made clear that the Judge was not prepared to reopen  the
    decision of Judge Birrell and treat the appeals  of  the  other  family
    members as valid. For the  Appellant  it  was  argued  that  the  first
    determination  in  time  should  take  precedence   and   the   October
    determination should be disregarded.

22.  I considered the issue. It was clear that  whether  or  not  there  had
    been an earlier determination the Judge intended the  determination  of
    October 2014 to be the final determination.  There was no other copy on
    the  file  at  the  date  of  promulgation   although   the   September
    determination was subsequently sent in by the  Appellant's  solicitors.
    In my view that had the status of a draft, it had not  been  served  on
    the Respondent nor had a copy been retained in the  court  file.   That
    document had no validity.  What I was dealing with was an appeal by the
    Respondent  against  the  decision  contained  in  the   October   2014
    determination.

23.  There had been no appeal against the decision of Judge Birrell nor  the
    affirmation  of  that  decision  by  Judge  Hussain  in   the   October
    determination and therefore matters stood as  they  were  before  Judge
    Hussain namely that there was no valid appeal before the Tribunal  from
    the other family members.  That was not  to  say  that  the  Article  8
    issues which affected all five could not be dealt with.  Judge  Hussain
    had dealt with the family life claim of them all and it  was  difficult
    to see what if any hardship had been caused to them by Judge  Hussain's
    decision not to reopen  the  question  decided  by  Judge  Birrell.   I
    indicated as much to the parties that I would proceed therefore to hear
    the Respondent's arguments on the error of law stage.

Error of Law Stage

24.  For the Respondent it was argued  that  the  Appellant  and  the  other
    family members were seeking to succeed on the  back  of  the  claim  in
    relation to Michael.  The Judge's approach to Article 8 was flawed.  It
    was contrary to the authority of EV Philippines.  Seven years after the
    age of 4 were more substantial than from 0 to 7.

25.  Although the Judge heard the appeal on 23rd July (before  the  relevant
    provisions of  the  2002  Act  came  into  force  on  28th  July  2014)
    nevertheless he had not promulgated his decision until 3rd October 2014
    (and had evidently had cause to rewrite it).  A determination  was  not
    finalised until it was served on the parties, in this  case  served  on
    the Respondent as well as the Appellant.  That meant that up until that
    date the Judge should have taken into consideration the 2002 Act  which
    he did not.  The Judge should have asked for further submissions on the
    new law post 28th July.  Even if the September  determination  was  the
    correct one that was still after the provisions of Section 117  of  the
    2002 Act came into force.  EV Philippines reminded Tribunals to examine
    the issue of proportionality carefully  not  just  look  at  a  child's
    circumstances.  Although the immigration status of the  child  was  not
    the child's fault the child nevertheless had no independent claim under
    private life Rules.

26.  Applying Section 117 of the 2002 Act, one had to  have  regard  to  the
    matters in paragraph 117B.  The Judge had  not  gone  through  the  six
    themes set out there.  The Judge had not engaged with 117B(iii).   None
    of  the  parties  were  independently  economically  sustainable.   The
    private lives of all of the family had been established at a time  when
    they were here unlawfully.  Looking at Section 117B(vi) Michael was  on
    the facts a qualifying child  and  it  was  not  in  dispute  that  the
    Appellant had a genuine and  substantial  parental  role  in  Michael's
    care.  However there was a second step whether  it  was  reasonable  to
    expect Michael to leave the United Kingdom.  The reasonable test was  a
    proportionality exercise, Section 117B(vi) was not an amnesty  and  the
    assessment of  reasonableness  had  to  take  into  account  the  other
    subparagraphs of Section 117B.  The sub-Section  did  not  say  that  a
    qualifying child could not be removed.

27.  For the Appellant Counsel argued that the new law  had  not  come  into
    force when  the  case  was  before  Judge  Hussain  on  23rd  July.  No
    submissions were made about section 117B and that was why the Judge had
    not mentioned the 2014 Act.  In any event the  crux  of  the  case  was
    Michael's best interests and the unreasonableness of his removal.   The
    Judge had looked at the matter in the round  including  the  length  of
    time Michael had been in the United Kingdom  and  his  schooling.   The
    Judge was entitled to arrive at the finding he did.  The Appellant  and
    Mrs Onasile could not qualify under the Immigration Rules and the Judge
    had gone on to carry out the balancing exercise using Razgar.  He found
    that looking at all the circumstances including the fact  that  Michael
    had been here for seven years it  would  be  disproportionate  for  the
    Respondent to remove the remaining members of the family.   The  family
    were maintained by the church  but  they  were  not  a  burden  to  the
    taxpayer.  The Judge had come to the  right  decision  as  it  was  not
    reasonable to expect Michael to travel to Nigeria.  Briefly in response
    the Presenting Officer reiterated that nothing had  been  said  in  the
    determination about EV Philippines.

28.  At the end of submissions I gave my oral decision  that  I  found  that
    there was a material error of law in  the  Judge's  determination  such
    that it fell to be set aside and the decision remade.  I indicated that
    I would give full written reasons in my determination why  I  found  an
    error of law and I now do so.

29.  Although  the  Judge  heard  this  matter  on  23rd  July  he  did  not
    promulgate  his  determination  until  October  by   which   time   the
    Immigration Act 2014 had amended the  2002  Act  by  the  insertion  of
    Section 117A, B, C and D.  It was incumbent upon the Judge to  consider
    this matter, there being no transitional  provisions  and  the  section
    applying immediately.  In  the  circumstances  the  Judge  should  have
    either brought the matter back to court or  at  least  invited  written
    submissions from the parties on the issue of whether the new  law  made
    any significant difference.  At the date of hearing on 23rd  July  2014
    the Judge was required to weigh in the balance the fact that on the one
    hand none of the Appellants  had  leave  and  were  seeking  to  remain
    outside the Rules and on  the  other  hand  they  would  need  to  show
    compelling and compassionate  circumstances  as  to  why  their  claims
    should be admitted outside the Rules.  The Judge  had  focused  on  the
    best interests of Michael and had accepted that it was unreasonable  to
    expect Michael to leave the United Kingdom.  That was not to carry  out
    the  balancing  exercise  correctly  and  the  determination  gave  the
    impression that the Judge regarded Michael as a "trump card".   It  was
    difficult to see how the Judge  had  arrived  at  the  conclusion  that
    Michael's interest in continuing his education made it unreasonable  to
    expect him to return with the rest of his family to Nigeria.

The Substantive Hearing before Me

30.  Having set aside the decision I heard brief  oral  testimony  from  the
    Appellant who indicated that he had one or two things  to  add  to  the
    evidence  he  had  given  at  first  instance.   The  Judge   had   not
    concentrated only  on  Michael.   The  Appellant  had  three  children,
    Benedict who was aged 8 years and Grace as well as Michael.   The  case
    of EV Philippines was not relevant as the children  in  that  case  had
    spent less than four years in the United Kingdom whereas  his  children
    had been in the United Kingdom ten years and eight years  respectively.
    The children in EV Philippines were not qualifying children  under  the
    2014 Act.

Closing Submissions

31.  For the Respondent the Tribunal was urged to look  at  the  case  in  a
    broader context.  The question was whether it would be unreasonable  to
    expect Michael to reintegrate back into life in Nigeria.   He  was  not
    responsible for the parents' behaviour but he was  not  here  lawfully.
    His parents had  manipulated  the  Immigration  Rules.   Little  weight
    should be given to the private life  of  any  members  of  the  family.
    There was no evidence to show an adverse effect on Michael.  There were
    no health issues.  It was reasonable for Michael to go  to  Nigeria  to
    restart his life there. Extended members of the family could help them.
     It was clearly reasonable for Michael to return to Nigeria.   For  the
    family to have succeeded under the Rules they would have  had  to  have
    met the  maintenance  requirements  that  is  to  say  shown  that  the
    Appellant had �18,600 for himself and his wife had �2,300 for  each  of
    the three children.  Such monies as the Appellant had came nowhere near
    those levels. The Appellant had never worked and the family  could  not
    maintain themselves. They were living below the subsistence level.   In
    Haleemudeen it was said that there needed to  be  something  compelling
    outside the Rules.

32.  Grace was also a qualifying child. She had  been  unwell  and  she  was
    being treated with painkillers but that was not  enough  to  say  there
    were inadequate facilities in Nigeria. The same considerations  applied
    for her as for Michael.  The Appellant and his wife sought  to  benefit
    from free education for their children when they were not  entitled  to
    it.

33.  In closing for the Appellant Counsel accepted that  the  Appellant  and
    Mrs Onasile  could  not  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  but  Michael
    qualified under paragraph 276ADE as he had been here for  seven  years.
    The Rules did not specify  what  age  a  child  had  to  be  when  they
    completed those seven years.   It  would  vary  from  child  to  child.
    Michael was doing well at school, he was settled there and  had  social
    friendships.  The United Kingdom was  the  only  country  that  Michael
    knew, he had never returned to Nigeria.  He had set down roots  in  the
    United Kingdom.  That he had no status was not his fault.  As  a  minor
    he could not be held responsible for the sins of his parents.   He  was
    an innocent victim.

34.  Turning to Grace, she was also a qualifying child born  in  2006.   She
    was over 8 now.  She suffered from sickle cell anaemia  although  there
    was no medical evidence to substantiate that there was oral and written
    evidence that she needed careful looking after.   It  was  unreasonable
    and disproportionate to remove the two children Michael and Grace  from
    the United Kingdom.  The new Act was now in force.  One had to focus on
    Section 117B(vi).  The reasonableness arguments would apply here.

Findings

35.  As I have set aside the decision of Judge  Hussain  I  must  apply  the
    provisions of the 2002 Act.  This is an appeal under Article  8  and  I
    remind myself of the step by step approach  required  by  the  case  of
    Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.

36.  Undoubtedly there is family life between the Appellant,  his  wife  and
    their three children.  That family life would  be  interfered  with  by
    requiring the Appellants to return to Nigeria.  The  Appellants  cannot
    bring themselves within the Immigration Rules and they are clearly  not
    economically  self-sufficient.    The   legitimate   aim   pursued   of
    immigration control  is  because  of  the  economic  wellbeing  of  the
    country.  The issue is whether the  effect  on  the  family's  life  by
    requiring them to return to Nigeria is proportionate to the  legitimate
    aim being pursued.  This is the balancing  exercise  and  there  are  a
    number of factors which  I  have  to  consider  in  carrying  out  that
    exercise.

37.  The first matter I have to consider is the best interests of the  three
    children.  They are a primary concern of the Tribunal although the best
    interests are not paramount.  I must consider  their  interests  first.
    Undoubtedly the best interests of the three children are to remain with
    their parents.  The Respondent's case is that all five  family  members
    would be returned together and therefore  the  best  interests  of  the
    children would be satisfied.  The argument in this case is  that  there
    would be an interference with Michael's education  and  that  he  would
    find it hard to reintegrate into a country which he does not  know  and
    has no experience of.  In short it would be unreasonable to expect  him
    to travel to Nigeria.  A similar argument is made in  relation  to  the
    child Grace.  In the case of Benedict,  he  is  4  years  old  and  his
    interests would therefore be very much focused on those of his parents.
    It  is  not  argued  independently  in  this  case  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable to expect him to travel to Nigeria with the  family.   The
    issue is whether it is reasonable to expect Michael and Grace to travel
    with the family all other things being equal.

38.  In relation to Michael's education, I do consider that the decision  of
    EV Philippines is of relevance in this case.  Whilst it is correct that
    Michael and Grace are older than the children in EV Philippines, it  is
    not the case that EV Philippines will only apply where exactly the same
    facts are repeated in a case.  The Court of Appeal  in  EV  Philippines
    was setting out broad principles  to  be  applied  when  considering  a
    child's best interests under Section 55 of the  2009  Act  and  in  the
    proportionality exercise.

39.  Michael has no right to be here and thus has no  independent  right  to
    an education in  this  country  at  taxpayers'  expense.   Nevertheless
    because of the machinations of his parents that is  what  he  has  been
    able to receive.  It is quite correct  he  cannot  be  blamed  for  the
    faults of his parents but as EV Philippines reminds  the  Tribunal  and
    the parties there is no obligation on the United Kingdom to educate the
    world.  That Michael is doing well at school is pleasing  for  him  and
    his parents but it is not a matter of great significance when  weighing
    up the proportionality of interference with family life.

40.  The second argument made in Michael's favour is  the  sheer  length  of
    time he has been here.  I note that Judge Hussain  found  that  Michael
    did have cultural ties to Nigeria as well as ancestral  ties.   English
    is widely spoken in Nigeria and Michael is still  at  an  age  when  he
    could adapt to the educational system there.  He would have the support
    not only of his own family but of his family's extended family members.
     I see no reason why he would not  be  able  to  reintegrate  into  the
    community.  Grace has certain medical problems but there is no evidence
    to suggest that they cannot be dealt with in Nigeria.  The  family  may
    be apprehensive about the level of care  in  Nigeria,  particularly  as
    they were advised when Grace was  born  to  take  her  to  an  advanced
    country for treatment.  This they did notwithstanding  that  they  have
    overstayed unlawfully.  Grace  too  has  had  the  benefit  of  medical
    treatment at public expense to which she was not entitled.   I  see  no
    reason why she could not receive adequate medical treatment even if  it
    was not at the same standard as this country.  It may well  be  that  a
    school in Nigeria might not be prepared to go as far as a school in the
    United Kingdom in maintaining contact with Grace's parents but I do not
    consider that such matters are of  sufficient  weight  as  to  make  it
    disproportionate to remove Grace with the rest of the family.

41.  The Appellant and Mrs Onasile  also  claim  to  remain  in  the  United
    Kingdom under  Article  8.   The  principal  argument  is  that  it  is
    unreasonable  to  expect  Michael  to  leave  the  United  Kingdom  and
    therefore Michael has to be looked after by someone that is to say  his
    parents who should therefore remain.  The Appellant  has  no  means  of
    support,  his support from the church is precarious and  could  as  the
    Respondent points out stop at any time.  Although he claims not to be a
    burden on  the  taxpayer  (aside  from  the  burdens  incurred  by  his
    children) that position could change  at  any  time.   I  am  far  from
    satisfied that the Appellant can achieve any form of economic viability
    in the future.

42.  The final aspect relied  upon  by  the  Appellants  is  the  effect  of
    Section 117B (vi) of the 2002 Act.  This provides that in a case  where
    a person is not liable to deportation (as is the case here) the  public
    interest does not require that  person's  removal  where  they  have  a
    genuine and subsisting parental relationship with  a  qualifying  child
    and it would not be reasonable to expect the child to leave the  United
    Kingdom. In this case both Michael and Grace  are  qualifying  children
    because both have been in this country for more than seven years.   The
    Act defines qualifying children at Section 117D but does not specify at
    what age the seven years should be lived.

43.  It is not in dispute that the Appellant and his  wife  have  a  genuine
    and subsisting parental relationship with all three of  their  children
    but for the purposes of the section particularly so  with  Michael  and
    Grace.  The issue is whether it would be reasonable to  expect  Michael
    and Grace to leave  the  United  Kingdom.   That  they  are  qualifying
    children does not of  itself  answer  the  question.   The  sub-Section
    envisages a proportionality exercise in  order  to  be  compliant  with
    Article 8.  The Tribunal has to look at the reasonableness of expecting
    the children to leave the United Kingdom and that means looking at  all
    of the matters in the round but taking the children's best interests as
    a primary consideration.

44.  It follows  from  what  I  have  said  above  that  I  consider  it  is
    reasonable to expect Michael and Grace to leave with their parents  and
    Benedict and travel to Nigeria.  Michael can receive  an  education  in
    Nigeria, Grace can receive  medical  care,  the  Appellant  and/or  Mrs
    Onasile could seek work in order to  be  economically  self-sustaining.
    The family would be returned together and could continue to enjoy their
    family and private life together in Nigeria the country of  which  they
    are all citizens.

45.  I ascribe little weight to the private life of any of  the  members  of
    the family in this case since they have  established  their  respective
    private lives for the most part while here unlawfully.  The  children's
    private lives are interconnected with their  schooling  and  healthcare
    needs which I have dealt with above. The Appellant has not  worked  and
    he and Mrs Onasile have  been  dependent  upon  the  charity  of  their
    church. By virtue of Section 117B (4) of the 2002 Act little weight  is
    to be given to a private life established when the  person  is  in  the
    United Kingdom unlawfully as is the  case  here.  There  is  thus  very
    little to put in the scales in favour of the Appellant and  his  family
    when assessing the proportionality of interference.  I  find  that  the
    removal of the Appellants would be a proportionate. I therefore dismiss
    the Appellant's appeal against the decision of the Respondent.

Anonymity Decision

46.  The Appellant requests an anonymity order in this  case  by  reason  of
    Grace's medical condition. There  was  no  such  order  made  at  first
    instance. I decline to  make  an  order  because  if  find  the  public
    interest  in  the  openness  of  Tribunals  outweighs   any   temporary
    inconvenience to the parties.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set it aside.

I have remade the decision by dismissing the Appellant's appeal against  the
Respondent's decision to refuse to grant leave and to remove them.

Appellant's appeal dismissed.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

The  First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  a  fee   award   in   this   case
notwithstanding that the appeal had  been  allowed.   As  I  have  set  that
decision aside  and  remade  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  Appellants'
appeals I do not make a fee award either.
