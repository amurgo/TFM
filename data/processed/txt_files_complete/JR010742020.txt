BEFORE Upper Tribunal Judge Keith

HAVING considered  all  documents  lodged  and  having  heard  Mr  A  Mussa,
Solicitor-Advocate, OneLaw Chambers, for the applicants and  Mr  Ruck-Keane,
instructed by GLD, for the respondent at a hearing on 10th February 2021

IT IS ORDERED THAT:

    1) The application for judicial review is granted for the reasons in the
       attached judgment.


    2) The respondent's decision of 20th November 2019, refusing the Tier  1
       (Entrepreneur) application and the administrative review decision  of
       24th December 2019 are quashed, with the agreement of the respondent.


    3) Also with the agreement  of  the  respondent,  the  respondent  shall
       grant, not later than close of business on 24th  February  2021,  the
       applicants further  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepreneur)
       applicant and  dependents,  following,  and  on  the  basis  of,  the
       applicant's pending application  made  on  23rd  January  2020.   The
       respondent has agreed to treat the previous  application  dated  22nd
       August 2019 as being varied by the application made on  23rd  January
       2020, under the same route.


    4) The application for orders seeking  to  quash  the  previous  refusal
       decision dated 26th June 2019 and the administrative review  decision
       dated 8th August 2019 is refused.
Costs

   5) The respondent shall pay the  applicants'  reasonable  costs  of  the
      application, to be  assessed  if  not  agreed.  The  application  for
      reimbursement of the fees for the 23rd January  2020  application  is
      refused.


Permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal


   6) Neither party has sought permission to appeal to the Court of  Appeal
      in respect of the  contested  aspect  of  the  orders  ((3)  and  (4)
      above)).  In any event, I refuse permission to appeal to the Court of
      Appeal for the same reasons that I have made  these  orders,  on  the
      basis that there is no arguable error of law in my reasons.

Notification of appeal rights

A decision by the Upper Tribunal on an application for judicial review is  a
decision that disposes of proceedings.

A party may appeal against such a decision to  the  Court  of  Appeal  on  a
point of law only. Any party who wishes to appeal should apply to the  Upper
Tribunal for permission, at the hearing at which the decision is  given.  If
no application is made,  the  Tribunal  must  nonetheless  consider  at  the
hearing whether to give or refuse permission to appeal (rule 44(4B)  of  the
Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).

If the Tribunal refuses permission, either in response to an application  or
by virtue of rule 44(4B), then the party wishing to  appeal  can  apply  for
permission from the Court of Appeal itself. This must be done by  filing  an
appellant's notice with the Civil Appeals Office  of  the  Court  of  Appeal
within 28 days of the date the Tribunal's decision on permission  to  appeal
was sent (Civil Procedure Rules Practice Direction 52D 3.3).

Judge Keith:

The Hearing

 1. These are the approved record of the Judgment and  reasons  which  were
    handed down orally at the end of the hearing on 10th February 2021.


 2. Both representatives and I attended the  hearing  via  Skype,  while  a
    hearing room remained open for  public  access  at  Field  House.   The
    parties did not object to attending via Skype and I was satisfied  that
    the representatives were able to participate in the hearing.


Background


 3. The applicants applied on  20th  March  2020  for  judicial  review  of
    several decisions, including an administrative  review  decision  dated
    24th of December 2019, which had confirmed an earlier decision of  20th
    November 2019 to refuse the  lead  applicant's  application,  with  the
    remainder of the applicants as her dependent spouse and  children,  for
    further leave to remain under the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa route.


 4. The applicants further specifically sought that not only that these two
    challenged decisions should be quashed, but that earlier refusals  also
    be quashed (see  �7  below).  The  applicants  also  sought  from  this
    Tribunal an order that  the  applicants  be  granted  leave  to  remain
    exceptionally and be provided with an  in-country  right  of  statutory
    appeal.


 5. In the statement of facts and  grounds  (page  21  of  the  applicants'
    bundle, hereafter referred  to  as  'AB',  ��4  to  6)  the  applicants
    referred to having initially applied to extend their  leave  to  remain
    under Tier 1 on 3rd  December  2018  and  that  their  application  was
    refused on 4th May 2019 but that upon administrative  review,  the  May
    2019 decision was withdrawn. This did not appear to be admitted  to  in
    the respondent's Acknowledgement of  Service  or  detailed  grounds  of
    defence, but Mr Ruck-Keane  confirmed  before  me  that  the  May  2019
    decision had been withdrawn.


 6. The withdrawal of the May 2019 decision was important  because  one  of
    the reasons for the renewed application  being  granted  permission  on
    oral renewal by Upper Tribunal Judge Owens on 5th August 2020 was  that
    the judicial review application was arguably not  academic,  despite  a
    further pending application for leave to remain  having  been  made  on
    23rd January 2020, because the  lawfulness  of  the  earlier  decisions
    refusing leave to  remain  were  relevant  to  the  continuity  of  the
    applicants' lawful residence under the Immigration Rules.  Put  simply,
    the applicants were on a route to settlement and refusal of the earlier
    applications might affect that route to settlement.


 7. The applicants also sought to challenge  an  earlier  refusal  decision
    dated 26th June 2019 and an administrative review  decision  dated  8th
    August 2019 which had maintained the June decision.


 8. In broad terms, the applicants asserted that they met the  requirements
    of Appendix A of the Immigration  Rules,  namely  in  relation  to  the
    points-based  system  of  Tier  1,  specifically  in  relation  to  job
    creation. If the respondent had any concerns, she should have sought to
    interview or make further enquiries of the applicants.  In  the  second
    alternative, the applicant argued that to the extent that they did  not
    meet the  requirements  of  Appendix  A,  the  respondent  should  have
    exercised her residual discretion, bearing in mind the purpose  of  job
    creation under the Tier 1 visa;  and  the  decisions  had  ignored  the
    applicants' human rights.


 9. On 9th June 2020, Upper Tribunal Judge Gill refused permission  on  the
    papers (pages 11 and 12 AB). She noted the lack of compliance with  the
    pre-action protocol process.  The applicants had  left  it  until  five
    days before the end of the three-month  long  stop  before  making  the
    application for judicial review and were now seeking a  stay  to  allow
    the respondent the opportunity to respond. She regarded the application
    as academic noting the applicants' further applications of 23rd January
    2020 which post-dated the challenged decisions; and she regarded it  as
    not arguable that the  respondent  was  obliged  to  consider,  in  the
    administrative review process, documents  which  were  not  before  the
    original decision maker; nor in her  view  was  it  arguable  that  the
    respondent was required to  interview  the  applicants;  nor  that  the
    respondent had arguably failed to consider the applicants' rights under
    Article 8 ECHR, when there had been no application except on the  basis
    of the points-based system.


10. The applicants renewed their application for  permission  for  judicial
    review on 25th June 2020. At a renewal  hearing  on  3rd  August  2020,
    Upper Tribunal Judge Owens granted permission on all grounds for review
    of the decisions to proceed  to  full  judicial  review.  She  regarded
    elements  of  the  grounds  as  less  strong  but  concluded  that  the
    application was not arguably academic because previous decisions  under
    challenge could have a bearing on the lead  applicant's  continuity  of
    lawful residence and there were arguable  errors  in  the  respondent's
    alleged failure, in  the  administrative  review  decision  dated  24th
    December 2019, to engage with the applicants' argument  that  the  lead
    applicant had created two full-time jobs lasting for  over  six  months
    and therefore met the Immigration Rules:  in particular one  job  as  a
    full-time waiter and a further part-time waiter/cashier job, as well as
    a part-time chef job. The decisions arguably did  not  address  whether
    the chef job could be considered as a part-time job and combined with a
    part-time waiter/cashier role to amount to a full-time job. It was also
    arguable that the respondent had not given  sufficient  weight  to  the
    fact she had already accepted  on  8th  August  2019  that  a  specific
    employee had been employed as a part-time cashier for a  period  of  12
    months.


11. The application was later automatically struck out for non-payment of a
    continuation fee, with notification on  8th  September  2020.  On  10th
    September 2020 the applicants'  solicitors  applied  to  reinstate  the
    judicial review proceedings. That  application  was  granted  by  Mr  A
    Hussain, Upper Tribunal Lawyer under delegated  judicial  powers  in  a
    decision dated 16th September 2020.


12. The respondent lodged additional grounds of defence,  pursuant  to  the
    directions of Upper Tribunal Judge Owens, on  8th  October  2020.   She
    continued to resist  all  the  grounds,  which  were,  in  summary,  as
    follows:


     a. Ground (1) - the respondent had failed  to  apply  the  Immigration
        Rules and her policy correctly. The sole refusal was based  on  the
        lead applicant satisfying row four of Table five of Appendix  A  in
        relation to job creation. This states:


        "The applicant has (a) established a  new  business  or  businesses
        that has or have created the equivalent of at least 2 new full time
        jobs for settled workers..."


     b. Ground (2) - the respondent had failed to exercise  her  discretion
        properly based on information known to her. The applicants asserted
        that the respondent ought to have conducted an interview  with  the
        lead applicant should she have any concerns. Where  the  respondent
        had accepted a specified  employee  as  a  cashier  in  an  earlier
        decision of 8th August 2019, she ought to have considered  this  in
        the subsequent application, even if the subsequent application  was
        erroneous in specifying the employee as a waiter.


     c. Ground  (3)  -  Exceptional  and  compelling  circumstances  -  the
        applicants' human rights including their good character, compliance
        with the visa system  and  payment  of  taxes,  the  investment  of
        substantial sums of money, should have been considered.  While  the
        information regarding how the creation of jobs requirement was  met
        could have been presented better to the respondent,  (page  32  AB)
        the respondent had failed to carry out a  proper  analysis  of  the
        evidence.


     d. Ground (4) - Article 6 ECHR - the respondent's process had breached
        the applicants' rights to a fair process in accordance with article
        6 ECHR as the lack of opportunity to  address  the  concerns  meant
        that  further  applications  in  the  future  would  be   similarly
        rejected. The applicants had also been deprived of the  opportunity
        of a statutory right of appeal before a First-tier Tribunal.


     e. Ground (5)- Article 8 ECHR  -  a  refusal  under  the  points-based
        system could engage article 8 ECHR, noting the authority of  Onwuje
        & Anor v SSHD [2018] EWCA Civ 331.  The respondent  ought  to  have
        considered  the  applicants'  Article  8   rights   including   the
        establishment of a private and family life in the UK.


13. While the respondent had until the Hearing before me  disputed  all  the
   above grounds for detailed reasons which, for the sake of  brevity  I  do
   not set  out,  by  the  time  of  the  Hearing,  and  following  'without
   prejudice' discussions between  the  applicants  and  respondent  on  the
   morning of the Hearing which resulted in me delaying  the  start  of  the
   Hearing, (for which I make no criticism of either party) the respondent's
   position had substantially changed.


The respondent's revised position at the Hearing


14. Whilst the changed position did not result in the  terms  of  an  agreed
   consent order, because not all the points could be agreed,  nevertheless,
   the respondent accepted that the decisions of 20th November 2019 and  the
   administrative review decision of 24th December 2019 should be quashed.


15. On the basis that the respondent no longer resisted the applications  in
   respect of these two elements of the orders  sought,  I  regarded  it  as
   appropriate to make them. Mr Mussa had also initially identified  at  the
   Hearing that  he  was  seeking  a  decision  on  whether  the  applicants
   continued to have lawful residence, which Mr Ruck-Keane regarded as  both
   unnecessary and inappropriate, but after considering the agreement by the
   respondent, (�3 of the Order) that the respondent had agreed to treat the
   previous application dated 22nd  August  2019  as  being  varied  by  the
   application made on 23rd of January 2020 under the same route,  Mr  Mussa
   no longer pursued this submission.


Remaining issues in dispute


16. The remaining issues in dispute were whether I  should  also  quash  the
   earlier decisions of 26th June and 8th August 2019 and whether  I  should
   order the respondent to reimburse  the  applicants  their  fees  for  the
   further application for leave to remain on 23rd January 2020.


17. The reasons for  my  decision  can  be  put  briefly.  Whilst  Mr  Mussa
   asserted that both earlier decisions were in similar terms to  the  later
   impugned decisions which have  now  been  quashed,  should  similarly  be
   quashed. All the refusals had been made on the basis that the  applicants
   did not meet the  Immigration  Rules.  The  applicants  had  consistently
   asserted that they met the requirements of  the  Immigration  Rules.  The
   applicants ought not to have been  put  to  the  expense  of  making  the
   further application of 23rd January 2020 and in addition to  their  costs
   of applying for judicial review, these fees should be reimbursed.


18. In response, Mr Ruck-Keane pointed out that I did not even have  a  copy
   of 26th June 2019 before me and the grounds failed to identify in any way
   what the challenge was to the 8th  August  2019  decision.  It  would  be
   perverse if I were to quash the latter decision when it had  been  relied
   upon by the applicants as forming one of the reasons for challenging  the
   later quashed decisions, because the respondent had accepted the duration
   of employment of a specified employee in  the  August  2019,  a  position
   which she later tried to resile from.   In  relation  to  the  claim  for
   reimbursement of visa fees, there was no need for the applicants to  have
   made the further visa application, and  an  award  of  these  fees  would
   amount to special damages beyond the normal award, in circumstances where
   the applicants had not complied with the pre-action protocol, as outlined
   by Upper Tribunal Judge Gill in her decision refusing permission  on  the
   papers.


Discussion and conclusions


19. First, I was not prepared to quash a decision, namely  the  decision  of
   26th of June 2019 when that decision was not before me. Mr Mussa accepted
   that no copy had been provided to me and he was  unable  to  explain  the
   lack of production of this document. Whilst I do not doubt in any way  Mr
   Mussa's integrity as a solicitor, I do not regard it  as  appropriate  to
   quash a decision based on a simple assertion that it was in terms similar
   to later quashed decisions. Second,  I accept Mr Ruck-Keane's  submission
   that the grounds  of  challenge,  while  seeking  to  quash  the  earlier
   decisions, in fact  contain  no  substantive  reasons  for  doing  so  or
   criticism of these earlier decisions (in contrast to  the  later  quashed
   decisions).   Whilst  I  have  a  copy  of  the  second   decision,   the
   administrative review decision dated 8th August 2019, (pages  99  to  102
   AB), that decision can only  be  safely  analysed  by  reference  to  the
   earlier June 2019 decision, as it is  an  administrative  review  of  the
   earlier June 2019 decision. For these reasons alone I  decline  to  quash
   either of the two decisions. On a more minor note, but still relevant,  I
   accept Mr Ruck-Keane's submission that the challenge to  the  8th  August
   2019 decision is not consistent with  reliance  by  the  applicants  upon
   elements of that very decision to challenge the later impugned decisions,
   specifically the conclusion in the  8th  August  2019  that  a  specified
   employee had been employed for a 12 month period.  In summary, I  am  not
   satisfied that the decisions of 26th June 2019 and 8 August 2019  contain
   any errors of law on public law grounds, and I decline to quash them.


20.  In relation to the issue  of  costs,  �5  of  the  Order  reflects  the
   agreement of the respondent to pay the applicants'  reasonable  costs  of
   the judicial review application, to be assessed it  not  agreed.  However
   notwithstanding the applicants' achievement, in large part, of what  they
   were seeking to achieve, it would not be in my view appropriate  to  make
   an additional award of the reimbursement  of  visa  fees  for  making  an
   application for leave to remain on 23rd January 2020.  Whilst  I  do  not
   criticise the applicants for doing so, this was, in essence a  "belt  and
   braces" step which was unnecessary  to  preserve  the  applicants'  legal
   position, when they had  not  yet  engaged  in  the  pre-action  protocol
   process, for which they can be criticised. In that  regard,  I  noted  UT
   Judge Gill's reflection in her decision dated  9th  June  2020  that  the
   applicants had left it until 19th March  2020  to  serve  the  pre-action
   protocol letter, i.e. five days before the end of  the  three-month  long
   stop. While they chose to make a further  visa  application  some  months
   before that pre-action protocol  correspondence,  their  success  in  the
   judicial review in relation to earlier challenged decisions does make  it
   appropriate to order reimbursement of visa fees for  an  additional  visa
   application which  was  still  pending  at  the  Hearing  before  me.   I
   therefore decline to order reimbursement of those visa fees.
