Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Richards, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Bayomi, instructed by Qualified Legal Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The respondent (hereinafter "the claimant") is  a  national  of  India.
    In a decision sent on 5 July 2017 we (Upper Tribunal Judges  Grubb  and
    Storey) set aside the decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Kimnell for
    material error of law.   Judge  Kimnell  had  allowed  the  appellant's
    appeal.  One of the reasons we gave for our decision was that the judge
    had failed to give "cogent reasons"  for  departing  from  the  Country
    Guidance decision in MD (same-sex oriented males: risk) India CG [2014]
    UKUT 00065 (IAC).  We also stated that we saw considerable merit in the
    Presenting Officer's (Mr Kotas's) submission that  the  conclusions  of
    the country expert relied on by the claimant, Dr Osella, appeared to be
    sweeping generalisations that were not set in the  context  of  the  CG
    decision in MD.  We relisted  the  hearing  to  re-make  the  decision,
    namely whether the claimant had established that he is at real risk  of
    persecution as a gay man returning from India.

2.   We heard submissions from Ms  Bayoumi  who  contended  that  since  the
    decision of the UT in MD matters had moved on.  She  pointed  out  that
    although Dr Osella did not address the case of MD, the expert had  been
    shown the Home Office refusal decision, which had  relied  on  MD.   Dr
    Osella identified the existence of a clear culture of violence directed
    against gays in India and a continuing possibility of arrest.   Whether
    or not Section 377 of the Indian  Penal  Code  (IPC)  remained  on  the
    statute book, LGBTI individuals faced serious harm against which  there
    was ineffective state protection and there would not be a viable option
    of internal relocation.  Dr Osella's report reflected the  findings  of
    the Canadian IRB report of December 2015 (post-dating MD)  which  noted
    that gays  were  stigmatised  and  there  had  been  violent  incidents
    directed against gays.  Prosecutions were rare but the law was used  to
    intimidate and harass and blackmail gays.  It was difficult  to  report
    partner assault.  Thus there had been developments since MD.

3.   Mr Richards submitted that the evidence relied  upon  by  the  claimant
    did not represent evidence sufficiently  cogent  to  justify  departure
    from the guidance in MD.

4.    Mr  Richards  said  that  Dr  Osella's  report  did  contain  sweeping
    generalisation and unsourced assertions.  The Country  Information  and
    Policy report on India: Sexual orientation and gender identity, Version
    2.0, February 2017 in Section 377 confirmed that  prosecutions  brought
    against  gays  are  extremely  rare;  whilst  there  are   arrests,   a
    significant proportion of those concerned men seeking sexual  relations
    with children.

Our assessment

5.   We are not persuaded that there is a sufficient  evidential  basis  for
    departing from MD.  Indeed it seems to us that the basic findings of MD
    have been strengthened by the more recent  evidence  contained  in  the
    aforementioned Country Policy and Information report.   Given  that  Ms
    Bayoumi places particular emphasis on the fact that there  continue  to
    be arrests of gay men by police authorities enforcing Section 377  IPC,
    it is  pertinent  to  cite  what  the  aforementioned  Note  states  at
    paragraph 4.3:

         "4.3 Enforcement and consequences of Section 377 IPC


         4.3.1    The Supreme Court of India noted in  its  judgment  of  11
                December 2013 that fewer than 200 people had been prosecuted
                under Section 377 IPC since it came  into  force  150  years
                ago.  A minority of those cases involved consenting adults.


         4.3.2    According to various reports cited by the Immigration  and
                Refugee Board of Canada, the threat of being  charged  under
                section 377 is  sometimes  used  by  police  to  harass  and
                discriminate against LGBT people in public spaces.


         4.3.3    The Times of India reported on  29  September  2016  that,
                according to the National Crimes Record  Bureau,  police  in
                various states and Union Territories registered 1,347  cases
                and arrested 1,491 people under  section  377  during  2015,
                including 207 minors and 16 women.   In  2014,  1,148  cases
                were registered.  The article noted, 'Though the figures  do
                not give a [break-down] of the gender  of  the  victims,  it
                mentions that  in  814  cases,  the  crimes  were  committed
                against  children.   The  remaining  crimes  were  committed
                against adults, but the report does not specify whether  the
                acts were consensual.


         4.3.4    The organisation Erasing 76 Crimes  commented  in  October
                2016, 'Some observers believe  that  the  vast  majority  of
                arrests under India's  Section  377  have  been  for  sexual
                assault of minors, especially boys.'


         4.3.5    The National Crime Records Bureau recorded  the  following
                data:


              '2015 (Source: Crime in India 2015 Statistics)


              1,347 cases were registered (reported by the police)  in  2015
                    under Section 377 IPC (table  1.3);  charge-sheets  were
                    submitted in 1,006 cases (tab.4.1); 1,491  persons  were
                    arrested (tab.12.1), of whom 177 were  children  and  16
                    were  women.  Transgender  persons  were   not   counted
                    separately (tab.12.2).  Trials  were  completed  in  378
                    cases, resulting in 175 convictions, 203 were  acquitted
                    or discharged (tab.4.5).  In  814  of  the  1,347  cases
                    registered, the victims were children (tab.6.3)  At  the
                    end of the year 2015, 199 persons were in custody  while
                    their cases were being investigated; a further 480  were
                    in custody pending trial; a total of 1,841 persons  were
                    on bail (tabs. 12.3-12.4).


              2014 (Source: Crime in India 2014 Statistics)


              1,148 cases were registered in  2014  under  Section  377  IPC
                    (table 1.3); 113 cases for  investigation  were  carried
                    over from 2013 (tab 4.1); charge-sheets  were  submitted
                    in 879 cases (tab.4.1); 1,279 persons were  arrested  in
                    2014 (tab.12.1), of whom 207 were children and  14  were
                    women. Transgender persons were not  counted  separately
                    (tab.12.2).  Trials  were  completed   in   233   cases,
                    resulting in 100  convictions,  133  were  acquitted  or
                    discharged  (tab.4.5).  In  765  of  the   1,148   cases
                    registered, the victims were children (tab.6.2).'


         4.3.6    The National Crime Records Bureau,  in  recording  arrests
                and convictions under section  377,  did  not  differentiate
                between consensual or non-consensual sexual relations.


         4.3.7    CPIT has not found evidence in other reports  or  articles
                that any persons have been tried and convicted under section
                377 since December 2013 in cases involving sexual  relations
                between consenting adults.


         4.3.8    The Pink News, in February 2015, quoted  the  chairman  of
                India's Law Commission as stating:


               'Section  377   is   discriminatory   in   its   application,
                    unreasonable in its intent,  deprives  a  group  of  its
                    personal autonomy and violates  individual  privacy  and
                    human dignity  ...  Consequences  of  the  laws  in  our
                    country on gay sex include damage to  the  psychological
                    well-being of homosexuals, encouragement of violence and
                    facilitation of  police  harassment  and  discrimination
                    against the LGBT community.'"

6.   This Note provides compelling reasons  for  not  attaching  significant
    weight to the figures for arrests relied on by Ms Bayoumi since  it  is
    stated that on analysis of the 2014 cases registered under Section  377
    IPC, in 765 of the 1,148 cases registered  the  victims  were  children
    (see 4.35 above) and it also  appears  unsafe  to  rely  fully  on  the
    remaining cases  as  evidence  of  persecutory  prosecution  since  the
    National Crime Records Bureau, in  recording  arrests  and  convictions
    under Section 377 did not differentiate  between  "consensual  or  non-
    consensual sexual relations" (see 4.3.6 above).

6.   To the extent that Ms Bayoumi seeks to rely on Dr Osella's  report,  we
    do not consider that it is a report to which we can attach  significant
    weight.  A  great  many  of  the  report's  assertions  are  unsourced.
    Further, the author does not appear, in reaching his own evaluation  of
    risks facing gay men in India, to take into  account  their  scale  and
    frequency.  For example the (unsourced) reference to two murders on  p.
    44 is not considered against the backings of the size of the population
    of India.

7.   Put simply, even taking the figures relied on by  Dr  Osella  regarding
    the number of arrests and incidents of physical harm  against  gays  in
    India, they do not constitute evidence of sufficient cogency to justify
    reaching a different conclusion as to general risk to gay men in  India
    from that reached in MD.

8.   The claimant's case is not based solely on  the  existence  of  general
    risk to gay men in India. Before Judge Kimnell he  gave  evidence  that
    his parents are totally against gay men and they had tried beating  and
    bullying him into marrying and that they will not support  him  in  any
    way if he lives as a gay man.  The judge  also  accepted  that  he  had
    already made three suicide attempts because of his  family's  bullying.
    A report from Professor Graham, also accepted by Judge  Kimnell,  found
    he had scars and lesions on his body as a direct result of  an  assault
    as described by the claimant and that he  had  borderline  anxiety  and
    suicidal ideation.

9.   In our assessment there are  no  good  reasons  to  consider  that  the
    claimant will face a repetition of the mistreatment he suffered at  the
    hand of his family because he will be able  to  avoid  that  by  living
    elsewhere in India.  His borderline anxiety and suicidal  ideation  are
    not sufficiently severe to prevent him from living  a  normal  life  in
    India as a  gay  man.  Whilst  he  may  face  some  level  of  societal
    discrimination, we do not find on the available evidence that it  would
    reach the level of persecution or serious harm or ill treatment. Nor do
    we consider (even if relocation within his own  city  did  not  achieve
    safety and the ability to live normally) that it  would  be  unsafe  or
    unreasonable for him to relocate within India.

10.  For the above reasons, the  decision  we  re-make  is  to  dismiss  the
    claimant's appeal, as he has not established that he would be  at  risk
    merely by virtue of being a gay man on return to India.

In summary

11.  We have already found that the FtT judge materially erred in law.

12.  The decision we re-make is to dismiss the claimant's appeal.
