Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr J Gajjar, Counsel, appearing on a Direct Access
basis
For the Respondent:    Ms K Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

     1. This is  a  remade  decision  following  the  identification  of  a
        material legal error in the decision of  Judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Moffat (the  judge),  promulgated  on  4  September  2019,
        dismissing the appellants' joint appeals against  the  respondent's
        decisions dated 16 January 2019 (in respect of the  1st  appellant)
        and 31 January 2019 (in respect of  the  2nd,  3rd,  4th,  and  5th
        appellants) refusing their human rights claims.


     2. In an 'error of law' decision promulgated on  2  January  2020  the
        Upper Tribunal found that the judge made a mistake on  a  point  of
        law in her assessment of the issue of dishonesty, which arose  from
        discrepancies between the 1st appellant's income disclosed to  HMRC
        and to the respondent covering the same periods  of  time.  It  was
        unclear whether the judge appreciated that the  burden  of  proving
        dishonesty rested with the respondent and she appeared to  conflate
        the general two stage approach in respect  of  the  application  of
        paragraph 322(5) (the immigration rule upon  which  the  respondent
        relied in refusing the 1st appellant  Indefinite  Leave  to  Remain
        (ILR)), considered in some detail in Balajigari v SSHD [2019]  EWCA
        Civ 673, with the approach to determining dishonesty.  Nor  was  it
        apparent that the judge approached the 1st appellant's  explanation
        for the discrepancies by reference to the 'minimum/basic  level  of
        plausibility' assessment following which the  the  burden  switches
        back to the Secretary of State to answer that evidence (Shen (Paper
        appeals; proving dishonesty) [2014] UKUT 00236 (IAC), Abbas, R  (On
        the Application Of) v SSHD [2017] EWHC 78 (Admin)).


     3. Having found the judge's decision to be unsafe and having regard to
        the Upper Tribunal Practice Statement of  the  18  June  2018,  the
        Upper Tribunal retained conduct of the appeal and had it listed for
        a further de novo hearing.

   Background


     4. The appellants are all nationals of Pakistan. The 1st appellant was
        born on 22 October 1977. The 2nd appellant is the wife of  the  1st
        appellant. She was born on 8 April  1985.  The  3rd,  4th  and  5th
        appellants are the minor children of the 1st  and  2nd  appellants.
        They were born on 22 January 2005, 14 August 2007 and  14  February
        2013.


     5. The 1st appellant entered the UK as a student on 19 June  2007.  He
        was granted further periods of  leave,  albeit  he  had  to  appeal
        against two separate refusals of his applications for further leave
        to remain. One of these  related  to  an  application  made  on  14
        October 2013 which was refused on 3 December  2013.  In  an  appeal
        decision promulgated on 9 September 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal Youngerwood allowed the  1st  appellant's  appeal  finding
        that the  evidence  adduced  by  him  demonstrated  his  income  of
        �53,339.23 as a sole trader for the period 16 September 2012 to  15
        September 2013. His last period of leave was as a Tier 1  (General)
        Migrant and this was valid until 19 November 2017.

     6. On 29 October 2015  the  2nd  to  5th  appellants  entered  the  UK
        pursuant to a grant of entry clearance as the dependents of the 1st
        appellant.

     7. On 9 November 2017 the 1st appellant applied for  Indefinite  Leave
        to Remain (ILR) on the basis of  his  long  residence  pursuant  to
        paragraph 276B of the immigration  rules.  On  the  same  date  the
        remaining appellants made human rights claims on  the  FLR(M)  form
        for leave to remain under Appendix FM based on  their  relationship
        with the 1st appellant (and the assumption that he would be granted
        ILR).

     8. In refusing the 1st appellant's application on 16 January 2019  the
        respondent noted that, in an earlier application made  on  4  April
        2011 for leave as a Tier 1 (General)  Migrant,  the  1st  appellant
        claimed to have received  an  income  of  �52,100  from  his  self-
        employment for the  period  5  December  2010  to  29  March  2011.
        However, the income initially declared to HMRC  for  the  tax  year
        2010/2011 was �28,651. The 1st appellant amended his tax return  on
        6 September 2017 to show  an  income  of  �52,100.  The  difference
        between the two figures was �30,122. In his later  application  for
        leave to remain on 14 October 2013 the 1st appellant claimed a self-
        employment income of �53,339.23 for the period 16 September 2012 to
        15 September 2013. This period covered two tax years. For  the  tax
        year 2012/2013 the 1st appellant initially declared to HMRC a self-
        employed income of �12,500, and for the tax year 2013/2014 the  1st
        appellant initially declared to  HMRC  a  self-employed  income  of
        �7,915, making a total income over the two tax years of  �20,  415.
        The 1st appellant amended his tax returns on 6  September  2017  to
        show a self-employed income of �35,492 for the tax  year  2012/2013
        and a self-employed income of �32,425 for the tax  year  2013/2014.
        The  respondent  rejected  as  incredible  a   'clerical   mistake'
        explanation provided  by  the  1st  appellant  in  a  questionnaire
        completed  by  him  on  20  April  2018.  Given  the  size  of  the
        discrepancies, the absence of other supporting evidence, the timing
        of the amendments  (two  months  before  his  ILR  application  was
        lodged) and the 1st appellant's claim to have  checked  and  signed
        and reviewed his tax returns (question 12 of the questionnaire) the
        respondent considered that the 1st appellant had acted  dishonestly
        and that the  discretion  contained  in  paragraph  322(5)  of  the
        immigration rules (one of  the  discretionary  rounds  of  refusal)
        should  not  be  exercised  in  the  1st  appellant's  favour.  The
        application consequently was refused  under  paragraph  322(5)  and
        paragraphs 276B(ii) and (iii) of the immigration rules.


     9. The respondent went on to consider the application under  paragraph
        276ADE of the immigration  rules  and  Article  8  outside  of  the
        immigration rules but concluded that there were no very significant
        obstacles to the 1st appellant's integration in Pakistan  and  that
        there were no  compelling  circumstances  outside  the  immigration
        rules such that a refusal of his human rights claim would result in
        unjustifiably harsh consequences for him and his family.

    10. As the 1st appellant was not granted ILR, the remaining  appellants
        were unable  to  meet  the  relevant  eligibility  requirements  of
        Appendix FM and their applications were  refused  accordingly.  The
        respondent  also  considered  their  applications  under  paragraph
        276ADE but she was not satisfied that the 2nd appellant would  face
        very significant obstacles to her integration in Pakistan  or  that
        the 3rd to 5th appellants had lived in  the  UK  for  a  continuous
        period  of  7  years  (a  necessary  requirement  under   paragraph
        276ADE(1)(iv)). Nor was the  respondent  satisfied  there  was  any
        evidence to establish the existence  of  exceptional  circumstances
        outside the immigration rules such that a refusal  to  grant  leave
        would breach Article 8.

    11. The appellants each appealed the respondent's decisions pursuant to
        s.82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

Summary of documentary evidence

    12. In addition to the respondent's bundle of documents the  appellants
        produced a large bundle of documents containing,  inter  alia,  the
        tax questionnaire completed by the 1st appellant on 20 April  2018,
        statements from the 1st and 2nd appellants (unsigned and  undated),
        a copy of the  decision  of  Judge  Youngerwood  promulgated  on  4
        September 2014, a letter issued  by  HMRC  dated  19  October  2017
        indicating their acceptance of an offer of �9,233.79 in respect  of
        the 1st appellant's outstanding tax  liability  for  the  tax  year
        2010/11, letters dated 20 October 2017 relating to  additional  tax
        the 1st appellant had to pay in respect of his income for  the  tax
        years ending 5 April 2013 and 5  April  2014,  various  HMRC  Self-
        Assessment Statements and National Insurance documents relating  to
        the 1st appellant,  a  downloaded  document  from  Companies  House
        website  confirming  that  Pearl  Business  Solutions  Co  Ltd  was
        dissolved on 3 May 2016, and a letter from Sarmad  &  Co,  the  1st
        appellant's current accountants, dated 24 July 2019.


    13. The bundle of documents additionally contained details of  the  1st
        appellant's   academic   achievements   and   employment    related
        certificates, Disclosure & Barring  Service  Enhanced  Certificates
        relating to  the  1st  appellant,  and  character  references  from
        Mohammed Basit Azeem, Mirza Tariq Manzoor, Mr Gull Khan  and  Nigel
        and Susan Simon. The bundle also contained evidence relating to the
        3rd appellant's attendance and progress within  the  Norbury  Manor
        Business & Enterprise College for Girls, including evidence of  her
        good  behaviour,  attendance,  achievements  and  punctuality,  and
        similar documentation relating to her  attendance  at  her  primary
        school.  Documents  relating  to  the  4th  and   5th   appellant's
        attendance at St Joseph College  were  also  included.  The  bundle
        finally included the authority of Balajigari [2019] EWCA Civ 673.

    14. The appellants served an Independent  Social  Worker  (ISW)  report
        authored  by  Jasmine  Smith  dated  17  February  2020.  The   ISW
        interviewed the 1st, 3rd 4th and  5th  appellants  on  15  February
        2020. She summarised the 1st appellant's claim  that  he  had  been
        badly affected by  the  allegations  of  dishonesty  and  that  his
        children had fully integrated "within  the  British  lifestyle  and
        culture." He claimed that the 3rd appellant needed to be in  school
        from year 7, 4 years ago, in order to catch up with her peers.  The
        ISW found the 3rd appellant to be a happy and outgoing  young  girl
        who preferred the weather, the lifestyle and the amenities  in  the
        UK to those in Pakistan. The 3rd appellant had  friends  from  many
        other countries and was concerned that she would be  unable  to  go
        out socially in Pakistan due to a lack of safety the 3rd  appellant
        said she would find it difficult to relocate  to  Pakistan  as  she
        would have to give up school subjects  she  enjoyed  and  would  be
        unable to master Urdu. The 3rd appellant  said  that  teachers  hit
        children in Pakistan and that the curriculum was limited.  The  4th
        appellant had more friends in the UK and preferred to  the  climate
        in comparison to Pakistan, and also  expressed  concerns  regarding
        Urdu. He played for his school cricket team and regarded school  as
        a big distraction from  the  stress  caused  by  their  immigration
        issues. The 4th appellant also preferred the cleanliness of the  UK
        environment and the regularity of electricity and  the  variety  of
        subjects he could study. He was anxious about returning to Pakistan
        and remembers being physically chastised at school.


    15. The ISW referred to the benefits to the  children  of  studying  in
        British schools and said that the UK had played an integral part in
        shaping the children's positive attitudes. She referred to  general
        studies  concerning  the  mental  health  impact  on  children   in
        immigration cases and claimed that it would be detrimental  to  the
        children to relocate to a country that was  now  outside  of  their
        norms, customs, resources and support networks with which they  had
        been familiar for almost 5  years.  The  ISW  referred  to  general
        studies relating to the impact that separation and loss as a  child
        can have on individuals in adult life and the impact of immigration
        cases on the mental health of young people. She found  that  the  3
        children conveyed resilience and identified  several  factors  that
        make it less  likely  that  children  will  develop  mental  health
        problems including a family  environment  without  severe  discord,
        family support for education, and wider support network within  the
        community, good housing, a  high  standard  of  living,  arrange  a
        positive sport and leisure activities and high  morale  in  school.
        The ISW referred to education becoming an umbrella outside  of  the
        family unit that has become a pillar of support for  the  children.
        The ISW believed the social networks the children had within the UK
        had supported and encouraged their mental health  as  well  as  the
        bond they had with their parents. She claimed the children were now
        westernised and  that  they  would  be  returning  to  Pakistan  as
        outsiders. Pakistan could not give the children  the  opportunities
        or experiences that they have so far obtained in the  UK.  The  ISW
        concluded that the children should remain in the UK as the  UK  has
        and will continue to serve their best interests.

    16. Mr Gajjar relied on his skeleton argument prepared  for  First-tier
        Tribunal hearing and provided a copy of Yaseen v Secretary of State
        for the Home Department [2020] EWCA Civ 157. Ms Everett relied upon
        the  decision  in  Abbasi  (rule  43;  para  322(5):   accountants'
        evidence) [2020] UKUT 00027 (IAC).



Evidence given at the hearing

    17. The 1st appellant adopted his witness  statement  which,  in  turn,
        adopted the contents of his completed tax questionnaire. In the tax
        questionnaire the 1st appellant confirmed that his  Self-Assessment
        tax  return  for  the  relevant  years  were   submitted   by   his
        accountants, both previous and present. The 1st appellant confirmed
        that he reviewed, checked and signed his tax  returns  before  they
        were submitted to HMRC.  He  needed  to  correct  his  tax  returns
        because "there was a clerical mistake". This was discovered in 2017
        when the 1st appellant was arranging his  documents.  He  contacted
        his accountant and amended his tax return.


    18. In his statement the 1st appellant denied intending to deceive HMRC
        or the Home Office. He claimed to have noticed the  errors  in  his
        tax returns when he was preparing and arranging his documents 2017.
        These errors were then confirmed by his new  accountants.  The  1st
        appellant stated that he had checked his original tax returns  when
        they were given to him and he recalled, as best he could, that they
        contained figures that seemed accurate and in  line  with  what  he
        told the Home Office. He stated, "I speculated that the errors were
        clerical, but  I  am  less  inclined  to  believe  this."  The  1st
        appellant made a voluntary payment in respect of the  discrepancies
        relating to the tax year 2010/11. He had been  making  payments  to
        HMRC prior to the amendment of his tax returns and  had  paid  some
        tax in 2012/13 and in 2014/15. The  1st  appellant  indicated  that
        Pearl Business Solutions was dissolved on 3 May 2016 and that  HMRC
        had accepted his amendments without penalising or accusing  him  of
        dishonesty. The 1st appellant claimed to have no experience so  far
        as tax was concerned and could not have geared himself up for  what
        his accountants were doing or to identify  their  errors.  The  1st
        appellant trusted the accountants to do an accurate  job.  The  1st
        appellant indicated that he had no  criminal  convictions  and  had
        received endorsements of his character from friends and family.  He
        claimed that his mental health been suffering since the allegation.




    19. In respect of his private life he confirmed that he had been in the
        UK since June 2007 and that his children and partner joined him  in
        2015. His oldest child, the 3rd appellant, was in secondary  school
        and was making excellent progress. The 3rd  appellant  had  friends
        and had  developed  ties  outside  of  the  family  unit.  The  1st
        appellant described  the  4th  and  5th  appellants  activities  at
        school, including academic and sporting achievements.

    20. A  brief  statement  from  the  2nd  appellant  confirmed  the  1st
        appellant statement to be true.

    21. The 1st appellant was not asked any  questions  in  examination  in
        chief. In cross-examination he explained that he became aware  that
        his 1st accountants had closed he went to see them at their offices
        and checked online. The 1st appellant  claimed  that  his  previous
        accountants had not submitted his tax returns  correctly.  The  1st
        appellant was asked whether  he  requested  Mr  Khan,  his  present
        accountant, to come to the Tribunal  and  give  evidence.  The  1st
        appellant said that Mr Khan just  gave  him  the  letter.  The  1st
        appellant had 2 brothers and his father living  in  Pakistan.  When
        asked whether he expected to return to Pakistan when he 1st entered
        the UK the 1st appellant onset "no". The 1st  appellant  was  asked
        where his family lived in Pakistan. He said he and his family lived
        in the family house, and that  this  was  where  his  father  still
        lived. It was a house belonging to his grandfather and the property
        had now been divided  between  the  family.  He  claimed  that  the
        government schools in Pakistan were not good and that he  would  be
        unable to afford  private  schools.  His  Family  were  happy  here
        enjoyed facilities that they would be unable to  get  in  Pakistan.
        When asked whether he would help his children  learn  to  read  and
        write the national language answered "no". He explained  that  they
        would need to go back to "primary class". In  answer  to  questions
        from me the 1st appellant said there were no  schools  in  Pakistan
        using Punjabi as a language of tuition. He confirmed that he  spoke
        Urdu. He did "not really" have any letters or emails  sent  between
        him and his previous accountants. This was because he went  to  see
        his previous account at his office and gave him the documents. When
        asked  whether  he  had  a  written  contract  with  his   previous
        accountants the 1st appellant said that he may have  had  one  long
        ago. The 1st appellant confirmed that his previous accountants  had
        submitted his tax returns. The 1st appellant said that, despite the
        fact that his previous accountants submitted his  tax  returns,  he
        did not have any documents produced or sent by them, including  any
        asking him to confirm their assessment of his tax liability.  There
        was no re-examination.


    22. Both parties made submissions that are a matter of record and which
        have been fully considered. Mr Gajjar additionally  relied  on  his
        skeleton argument.

Findings but and conclusions

    23. I first consider the issue of dishonesty. The respondent relied  on
        paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration  Rules.  This  provision  deals
        with general  grounds  of  refusal  and  falls  under  the  heading
        "Grounds on which leave to remain and variation of leave  to  enter
        or remain in the United Kingdom should normally be refused." It  is
        not therefore mandatory ground of refusal. Paragraph 322(5) reads,


             (5) the undesirability of permitting the person  concerned  to
             remain in the United Kingdom  in  the  light  of  his  conduct
             (including convictions which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph
             322(1C),  character  or  associations  or  the  fact  that  he
             represents a threat to national security

    24. The burden of proving that  the  appellant  was  dishonest  in  his
        conduct under paragraph 322(5) rests on  the  respondent,  and  the
        standard is the balance  of  probabilities.  There  is  an  initial
        evidential burden upon the respondent to produce  evidence  capable
        of supporting a prima facie case of dishonesty. If this  evidential
        burden is discharged the 1st appellant is required  to  provide  an
        explanation that meets a minimum or basic  level  of  plausibility,
        following which the burden  switches  back  to  the  respondent  to
        answer that evidence. The legal burden rests at all times with  the
        respondent.


    25. In his decision promulgated on 9 September 2014  judge  Youngerwood
        accepted that the 1st appellant earned �53,339.23 for the period 16
        September 2012 to 15 September  2013.  I  was  not  invited  by  Ms
        Everett to go behind this finding and I see no reason to do  so.  I
        therefore accept the 1st appellant's income during that  period  as
        disclosed to the Home Office. Nor is there any strong basis from me
        to dispute the 1st appellant's claimed  income  for  the  period  5
        December 2010 to 29 March 2011.

    26. In his 2011 application for FLR the 1st appellant claimed  to  have
        received an income of �52,100  from  his  self-employment  for  the
        period 5 December 2010 to 29 March 2011. The  income  he  initially
        declared to HMRC for the same  period  of  time  was  �28,651.  The
        difference  between  the  two  figures  was  �30,122.  This  is   a
        significant figure.

    27.  In his 2013 application for FLR the 1st appellant claimed a  self-
        employment income of �53,339.23 for the period 16 September 2012 to
        15 September 2013. The self-employed income he  initially  declared
        to HMRC for the tax year  2012/2013  was  �12,500,  and  the  self-
        employed income he initially declared for the  tax  year  2013/2014
        was �7,915, making a total income over the two tax  years  of  �20,
        415. There is a significant difference of �32,924.

    28. The amendments made by  the  1st  appellant  to  his  tax  returned
        occurred just 2 months prior to his ILR  application.  In  his  tax
        questionnaire the 1st  appellant  claimed  the  discrepancies  were
        caused by a 'clerical  mistake'  but  no  further  information  was
        provided and there was no explanation as to how the  mistake  could
        have arisen.  In  the  same  questionnaire  he  confirmed  that  he
        reviewed, signed and checked his tax returns. I am satisfied, based
        on the sizable discrepancies between the figures disclosed  to  the
        Home Office and those initially disclosed to HMRC,  the  timing  of
        the amendments, the fact that  the  1st  appellant  stood  to  gain
        financial advantage by under-declaring his income to HMRC, and  his
        claim to have checked the tax returns before they were submitted by
        his previous accounts,  that  the  respondent  had  discharged  the
        evidential burden.

    29.  I  now  consider  whether  the  1st  appellant  has  provided   an
        explanation that meets a minimum or basic level of plausibility. He
        claimed to have no tax experience and to have trusted his  previous
        accountants to have properly assessed his  tax  liability,  and  he
        recalled that the  figures  when  he  checked  his  returns  seemed
        accurate.

    30. Whilst I am prepared to accept that the 1st  appellant  has  little
        knowledge of the tax system his educational  achievements  indicate
        that he is nevertheless an intelligent man. An individual does  not
        require detailed knowledge of the tax system to know that tax  must
        be paid on their income, or to be aware of  what  their  income  is
        over a period of time, or to appreciate the importance  of  lodging
        accurate tax returns. This is particularly so when that individual,
        such as the 1st appellant, had to inform the Home Office  of  their
        income over the same period of time for the purpose of applications
        for further leave. A person's  knowledge  of  their  income  is  an
        important  element  in  their  lives.  It  is  therefore  extremely
        difficult  to  see  how  the  1st  appellant  could  have  honestly
        reviewed, checked and signed off the tax returns submitted  by  his
        previous accountants for the year 2010/2011 without being aware  of
        the very significant discrepancy with the income  he  disclosed  to
        the Home Office in his  2011  application.  The  same  is  true  in
        respect of the 2013 application. There is no suggestion that he was
        rushed when he reviewed the tax returns or that there was any other
        reason why he would have been unable to give the returns  his  full
        attention. This tends to undermine the 1st appellant's  claim  that
        his under-reported income declared to HMRC was as  a  result  of  a
        mistake or carelessness on his part.

    31. The tax questionnaire completed by the 1st appellant suggests  that
        it was he who discovered the "clerical error" when he was arranging
        his documents. On discovery of this  error  he  contacted  his  new
        accountants and amended his previous tax returns. This is confirmed
        in the 1st appellant statement at 8.3 where he claimed  he  noticed
        the errors when he was  preparing  his  documents  and  that  these
        errors  were  "confirmed"  by  his  new  accountants.  If  the  1st
        appellant himself discovered the inconsistencies in his initial tax
        returns in 2017, it is unclear why he did not identify them when he
        reviewed,  checked  and  signed  them  when  they  were   initially
        submitted. His claim that they "seemed accurate" and in  line  with
        what he told the Home Office lacks plausibility in the  context  of
        the size of the discrepancies and the fact that he would  have  had
        awareness of his income for the relevant period for the purposes of
        his FLR applications. The 1st appellant did not explain what caused
        him to become aware of the errors or why he only  became  aware  in
        2017.

    32. I accept that Pool Business Solutions Co Ltd dissolved as a company
        on 3 May 2016. The dissolution of  the  company  does  not  however
        adequately explain why the 1st appellant was unable to  produce  to
        the   Upper   Tribunal   any   documentary   evidence,    including
        correspondence, income tax calculations and  accounts  prepared  by
        Pearl Business Solutions. I have  considered  the  1st  appellant's
        explanation that he met his accountants at their place of business,
        and it was for this reason  that  he  did  not  have  any  relevant
        documentation. I do not  find  this  explanation  credible.  It  is
        highly unlikely that the 1st appellant was not provided with  paper
        copies  of  his  previous   accountant's   tax   calculations   and
        assessment, and it  is  inherently  improbable  that  the  previous
        accountants would have submitted tax returns on behalf of  the  1st
        appellant  without  obtaining  written  confirmation  that  he  had
        considered and confirmed the details of the tax returns. I  do  not
        accept the appellant's claim that there was no  correspondence  and
        no other documentation, either in paper form or email, relating  to
        his involvement with Pearl Business Solutions. It is  not  credible
        that there would be no terms of service or other  contract  details
        between the appellant and  his  previous  accountants.  Nor  is  it
        credible  that  the  appellant  would  not  have  retained  records
        relating to his instruction of  his  previous  accountants  or  the
        information requested by them or the  information  he  provided  to
        them given the importance of declaring accurate tax returns and the
        consequences for failing to do so.


    33. I am not assisted by the letter from Sarmad  &  Co  dated  24  July
        2019. The brief letter confirms that the accountancy firm  reviewed
        the 1st appellant's (self-assessment) tax returns in June 2017  and
        that "some statistical errors in his submitted  tax  returns"  were
        found. No further details were provided as to the nature  of  these
        "statistical errors", how they were discovered, or  how  they  were
        likely to have arisen. No further evidence was provided by Sarmad &
        Co and no-one from the accountancy firm  attended  the  hearing  to
        give evidence on the appellants' behalf. The author of the  letter,
        Mr Sarmand Khan, asserted his confidence that the inaccuracy in the
        1st  appellant's  tax  returns  was  "a  genuine  error"   but   no
        explanation was provided in support of this assertion.

    34. In determining the 1st appellant's 'innocent'  explanation  I  take
        full  account  of  the  Disclosure  &  Barring   Service   Enhanced
        Certificates relating to the 1st appellant confirming that  he  has
        no criminal convictions, cautions, reprimands or warnings, and  the
        character reference from Mohammed Basit Azeem, Mirza Tariq Manzoor,
        Gull  Khan  and  Nigel  and  Susan  Simon.  I  accept  that   these
        individuals consider the 1st appellant to be an honest person. They
        did not however attend the hearing and their evidence could not  be
        tested. Nor was it clear from the  letters  that  they  were  fully
        aware of the particular basis upon which  the  appellant's  honesty
        has been impugned.

    35. I have also considered the medical documentation  relating  to  the
        1st appellant indicating that he is stressed and the impact of  the
        refusal of ILR on his health. This is not however probative of  the
        1st appellant's honesty but of the consequences of the respondent's
        decision. I accept that the 1st appellant has  discharged  his  tax
        obligations in relation to other tax years. This does  not  however
        mean that he was unaware of the underreporting  of  his  income  in
        relation to the years in question. The appellant stood  to  gain  a
        significant financial advantage from  the  under-reporting  of  his
        income to HMRC.

    36. Having carefully considered the explanation  advanced  by  the  1st
        appellant I am not satisfied that it meets  the  minimum  or  basic
        level  of  plausibility.   Having   regard   to   the   significant
        discrepancies in the income declared to the Home  Office  and  that
        initially declared to HMRC,  the  timing  of  the  amendments,  the
        absence of any documentary or email evidence at all relating to the
        1st appellant's interaction with Pearl Business Solutions, and  the
        absence of any adequate explanation as to how the 'errors'  in  the
        initial tax  returns  could  have  arisen  or  why  they  were  not
        identified earlier by the 1st appellant, I am  persuaded  that  the
        respondent has discharged the legal burden of proving that the  1st
        appellant acted in a dishonest  manner  rather  than  merely  being
        careless or making a mistake, and that his presence in  the  UK  is
        undesirable.

    37. Paragraph 322(5) calls for a  balancing  exercise  (Balajigari,  at
        [38]). Mr Gajjar submitted that the  assessment  of  the  balancing
        exercise is likely to take into account factors  also  relevant  to
        the assessment under Article 8, with particular  reference  to  the
        position of the children. I agree. It is therefore  appropriate  to
        make factual findings relating to  the  children,  including  their
        best interests, as this will be  relevant  both  to  the  balancing
        exercise under paragraph 322(5) and under Article 8.

    38. In determining the best interests of the  3rd  to  5th  appellants,
        pursuant to s.55 of the Borders, Citizenship  and  Immigration  Act
        2009, I have applied the guidance given in EV (Philippines) & Ors v
        Secretary of State for the Home Department [2014] EWCA Civ 874  (at
        [35]), and Azimi-Moayed and others (decisions  affecting  children;
        onward appeals) [2013] UKUT 00197.

    39. The children entered the UK in October 2015.  They  have  therefore
        resided in the UK for less than 4 � years. Both their  parents  are
        Pakistani nationals who lived in Pakistan all their lives and would
        be able to assist the  children  in  readapting  to  life  in  that
        country. I accept that all three children are attending school  and
        that they are doing well academically. I take full account  of  the
        fact that the 3rd appellant has commenced studying for her GCSEs. I
        accept that the children have established  friendships  with  other
        children and have  developed  relationships  with  their  teachers.
        There is little  evidence  however  that  any  of  the  friendships
        developed by the children outside  of  the  family  unit  have  any
        elements of reliance or dependency. There is  nothing  to  indicate
        that the children have any particular health or  welfare  needs  or
        that they are not otherwise fit and healthy. Whilst  I  acknowledge
        the 1st appellant's health concerns as  expressed  by  him  in  his
        statement and the letter from his GP dated 19 July 2019 and the ISW
        report, there is little if any evidence  that  he  and  his  spouse
        cannot ensure the welfare and safety of  their  children.  The  1st
        appellant has his father and two brothers living  in  Pakistan  who
        could provide some additional support. Having  regard  to  the  ISW
        report I accept that the children wish to remain in the UK and that
        they have anxiety  about  returning  to  Pakistan  because  of  the
        climate, fears for their safety, because this  would  mean  leaving
        their friends and because the quality of their education and  their
        environment would be inferior in  Pakistan.  The  ISW  claimed  the
        children were now westernised and would be returning to Pakistan as
        outsiders. They have resided in the UK for less than 4 � years  and
        are, with respect to the ISW, unlikely to have  lost  knowledge  of
        their Pakistani heritage  and  culture  in  this  relatively  short
        period of time.

    40. The ISW relied upon the information provided  to  her  by  the  1st
        appellant in respect of the educational difficulties  his  children
        would encounter if returned to Pakistan, particularly in respect of
        the issues arising from the children's proficiency in  Urdu.  There
        is nothing to  suggest  that  the  ISW  herself  has  any  personal
        knowledge  or  expertise  in  the  Pakistani  educational   system,
        particularly in the Punjabi region. Her assessment  in  respect  of
        the impact on  the  children  of  being  returned  to  Pakistan  is
        therefore  based  on  her  acceptance  of  the  accuracy   of   the
        information provided by the 1st appellant and her  brief  reference
        to a 'Humanium' report that was not provided to the Tribunal. There
        was however  no  independent  evidence  provided  to  the  Tribunal
        confirming the 1st appellant's claims regarding Urdu  as  the  only
        language of tuition or his claim that the 3rd appellant would  have
        to be put back several school  years  to  enable  her  to  reach  a
        sufficient level of proficiency  in  the  language.  There  was  no
        consideration by the ISW as to the support the 1st appellant  would
        be able to provide to his children (he is able to  speak  Urdu  and
        his claim that he would not assist his  daughter  in  learning  the
        language displayed unreasonable intransigence on his part that  was
        inconsistent with his clear devotion and support for his  children)
        or whether there were  additional  classes  or  other  transitional
        arrangements that could be implemented to assist the children.

    41. I find, having regard to the aforementioned factors and the factors
        identified in EV (Philippines), that it is in the best interests of
        the children to remain in the UK, but only  just.  This  assessment
        has been finely balanced, particularly given the  short  time  that
        the children  have  resided  in  the  UK,  their  familiarity  with
        Pakistan and the support they would receive  from  their  immediate
        family unit if  returned.  In  reaching  this  conclusion  I  place
        particular weight on the fact that the  3rd  appellant  is  now  15
        years old and that, although she  has  resided  in  the  UK  for  a
        relatively short period of time, she is  commencing  study  of  her
        GCSEs, and that all the children wish, quite naturally,  to  remain
        in a country where they have developed friendships and  where  they
        enjoy a higher standard of living and greater scope  in  education.
        The best interests of the children are a primary consideration, but
        they are not a paramount consideration.

    42. In undertaking the balancing exercise under paragraph 322(5) I take
        account of my finding that it is  in  the  best  interests  of  the
        children to remain in the UK, that this is a primary consideration,
        that the 1st appellant is  now  making  good  his  outstanding  tax
        liability, that he has no criminal  convictions  or  cautions,  the
        character references provided in support of the 1st appellant, that
        he has lived in the UK lawfully for  12  years,  and  that  he  has
        otherwise paid  tax  on  his  earnings.  Against  these  factors  I
        consider the 1st appellant's dishonesty.  The  degree  of  the  1st
        appellant's under-reporting, covering a period of  3  separate  tax
        years, was significant. The 1st appellant only sought to amend  his
        tax returns and make good his tax obligations a short  time  before
        he made his ILR application. This suggests that, but for  his  need
        to apply for ILR, he would not have disclosed his underreporting.

    43. I remind myself that children must not be blamed  for  matters  for
        which they are not responsible, such as a parent's conduct (Zoumbas
        [2013] 1 WLR 3690). Whilst it  is  in  the  best  interest  of  the
        children to remain in the UK, they have resided in the UK for  less
        than 4 � years and would still be familiar with the culture and way
        of life in Pakistan, including, certainly in respect of the 3rd and
        4th appellants, the school system. Although the 3rd  appellant  has
        started studying for her GCSEs there was inadequate  evidence  that
        she would be unable to take an equivalent exam in Pakistan or  that
        she would be so disadvantaged by her lack of  proficiency  in  Urdu
        that she would be put back several school years, or  that  suitable
        extra classes or other arrangements could not be put  in  place  to
        ease her transition. Whilst  her  current  studies  are  clearly  a
        relevant factor, the evidence from her school and the ISW  suggests
        that  she  and  her  siblings   are   intelligent,   conscientious,
        hardworking and resilient, as demonstrated by their ability to cope
        with a new culture and school system when they first arrived  here.
        There was no evidence that the children  were  suffering  from  any
        physical or mental health problems. Whilst all  the  children  will
        feel sad that they must leave their friends, there is no reason why
        they could not continue to remain in contact through  remote  forms
        of communication or make new friends in Pakistan.  Having  balanced
        all these factors, I find that the balancing exercise falls against
        the exercise of discretion in  the  1st  appellant's  favour  under
        paragraph 322(5).


    44. I now consider  Article  8.  The  1st  appellant  cannot  meet  the
        requirements for ILR  given  my  assessment  above  in  respect  of
        paragraph 322(5). I note that the 1st appellant  was  also  refused
        under paragraph 276B(ii) of the Immigration  Rules  and,  following
        Yaseen, a refusal under this paragraph does not require  dishonesty
        to  be  proved,  but  that  a  balancing  exercise  must  still  be
        undertaken. My factual findings  could  not  however  result  in  a
        different  conclusion  under  paragraph  276B(ii).  There  was   no
        suggestion from Mr Gajjar, either in his skeleton argument  or  his
        oral  submissions,  that  the  1st   appellant   could   meet   the
        requirements of paragraph 276ADE. The 1st appellant has not resided
        in the UK for 20 years and, in light  of  my  factual  findings  in
        respect of paragraph 322(5), he fell afoul of the requirements of S-
        LTR.1.6. Nor was it suggested  that  there  were  very  significant
        obstacles to the 1st appellant's integration in Pakistan. He  lived
        in the country for most of his life, speaks Urdu and  Bengali,  and
        is familiar with the culture and the way of life.  His  educational
        qualifications suggest that he could find employment and he and his
        family could be supported by  his  father  and  siblings  until  be
        obtained employment.


    45. There was scant information  provided  to  me  concerning  the  2nd
        appellant.  There  was  no  suggestion  that  she  could  meet  the
        requirements of the immigration rules giving expression to  Article
        8 rights, either in respect of her private  life  (under  paragraph
        276ADE) or in respect of her family life (Appendix FM).  No  member
        of the immediate family unit are settled in the  UK  and  none  are
        British citizens or  present  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
        humanitarian  protection.  The  family  unit  would  be   returning
        together. None of the children have lived in the UK for at least  7
        years. They could not therefore meet the requirements of  paragraph
        276ADE(iv) of the Immigration Rules.

    46. I must consider whether, although the appellants  cannot  meet  the
        other requirements of the Immigration Rules,  a  refusal  to  grant
        them further leave to remain would breach GEN.3.2 of appendix FM as
        it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences  and  therefore
        be  disproportionate  under   Article   8.   In   undertaking   the
        proportionality  exercise,  I  must  also  consider   the   factors
        identified in s.117B of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act
        2002 (the 2002 Act).

    47. I note that the 3rd to 5th appellants cannot meet the definition of
        'qualified child' in s.117D(1) of the 2002 Act  because  they  have
        not lived in the UK for a continuous period of  7  years.  Although
        the assessment of 'reasonableness' in s.117B(6)  of  the  2002  Act
        remains a relevant factor in the overall  proportionality  exercise
        the 'reasonableness' test, as considered  in  KO  (Nigeria)  [2018]
        UKSC 53, which focuses exclusively on the impact on  the  children,
        has no applicability. Neither  representative  demurred  from  this
        observation at the hearing.

    48. I nevertheless consider whether it  would  be  reasonable  for  the
        children, and in particular the 3rd appellant,  to  leave  the  UK.
        Much of this assessment has already been undertaken above,  when  I
        considered the balancing exercise under paragraph 322(5).  I  find,
        for the reasons  given  above,  that  the  best  interests  of  the
        children are to remain in the UK, and I remind myself that the best
        interests assessment focuses exclusively on the children  and  does
        not take into account the conduct of the parents.

    49. Without unnecessarily repeating  my  earlier  assessment,  I  find,
        whilst it is in the best interests of the children to remain in the
        UK, and that this is a primary consideration, it would nevertheless
        be reasonable to expect them to return  to  Pakistan.  In  reaching
        this conclusion I take into account that  the  children  have  only
        lived in the UK for a relatively short period of time and that they
        are unlikely to have lost their knowledge of the culture and way of
        life in Pakistan, that their parents are both  Pakistani  nationals
        who have no right to remain in the UK and  who  would  be  able  to
        assist their children in re-integrating  (there  is  no  suggestion
        that the children have anything other than strong  and  loving  and
        supportive relationships with their parents, a point emphasised  by
        the ISW), and that the family unit as a whole are likely to receive
        at least some initial support from the 1st appellant's  family  and
        possibly from the 2nd appellant's family who also live in Pakistan.
        Whilst the 1st appellant informed the ISW  that  he  had  sold  the
        family home in Pakistan he gave evidence at the Tribunal  that  his
        family still own the home in which he lived prior to coming to  the
        UK and in which his father continues to  reside,  although  it  has
        been divided up between the family. The children are not of an  age
        where they have established significant relationships  outside  the
        immediate family unit, although I accept the evidence given to  the
        ISW that the children do have good friendships formed at school  at
        through cricket clubs.


    50. I have again taken account of the  stage  of  the  3rd  appellant's
        education. I note that she has commenced her  first  year  of  GCSE
        study and that this is an important examination for her. As already
        indicated, I was not provided with any research undertaken  by  the
        1st  appellant  in  respect  of  any  equivalent   examination   or
        transition arrangements that could be applied to her to ensure  she
        was sufficiently proficient in Urdu to participate in the  relevant
        classes, and I rejected the 1st  appellant's  surprising  assertion
        that he would not help his children in learning Urdu. In  light  of
        the above assessment, and  having  regard  to  the  factors  in  EV
        (Philippines), I find it would be reasonable for  the  children  to
        return to Pakistan, even were I to apply the KO (Nigeria) test  and
        discount entirely the other relevant public interest factors.

    51. I must nevertheless take account of  the  public  interest  factors
        when undertaking the full proportionality assessment, including the
        1st appellant's significant dishonesty.  S.117B(1)  indicates  that
        the maintenance of effective immigration control is in  the  public
        interest. None of the appellants meet the substantive  requirements
        of paragraph 276ADE. I have little evidence  relating  to  the  2nd
        appellant's proficiency in English, but I  am  satisfied  that  the
        remaining appellants are all proficient in English  (s.117B(2)).  I
        am additionally satisfied that the 1st appellant has  the  capacity
        to  be  financially  independent  (s.117B(3)).  These  are  however
        neutral factors. None of the appellants have ever been  in  the  UK
        unlawfully  (s.117B(4)).  The  private  lives  established  by  the
        appellants  has  occurred  when  their   immigration   status   was
        precarious  (Rhuppiah  [2018]  UKSC  58;  s.117B(5)),  although   I
        acknowledge  and  take  into  account  that  in  considering   this
        provision in respect of the children,  they  had  no  control  over
        their immigration status and that they have  always  been  lawfully
        present. I again remind myself that a child must not be blamed  for
        matters for which he or she is not responsible, such as a  parent's
        conduct.


    52. Whilst I have considerable sympathy for the children, and  the  3rd
        appellant in particular, I am not satisfied, having regard  to  the
        balancing exercise undertaken above, that the refusal of  leave  to
        remain would result in unjustifiably harsh  consequences.  Although
        the  3rd  appellant  may  encounter  some  difficulty  in  becoming
        proficient in Urdu, she is a bright child who will have the support
        of her family in learning the language. I have  not  been  provided
        with  adequate  evidence  that  appropriate  arrangements  for  her
        transition to the Pakistani school system could not be made. Whilst
        all the children are likely to enjoy a better quality of  education
        in the UK, this must be balanced  against  their  relatively  short
        residence  here,  their  family  connections  in  Pakistan,   their
        knowledge of the country and culture, and the real world  situation
        that their parents are Pakistani citizens with no right  to  remain
        in the UK. I consequently find that the decisions under appeal  are
        proportionate under Article 8 and dismiss the appeals.
