Representation:

For the Claimant:      Mr R Sharma, Legal Representative
For the Respondent:    Mr S Allan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


    (1)     The date on which an application for entry clearance is made is
       not effectively established by paragraph 30 or any other  provisions
       of the Immigration Rules, and has therefore  to  be  established  by
       reference to statute and secondary legislation.

    (2)     An application for entry clearance that does  not  comply  with
       the requirement in regulation 37 of the Immigration and  Nationality
       (Fees) Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1055) to be accompanied by  payment
       of a fee is a nullity - it is not an application for the purpose  of
       the immigration rules or any statutory provisions.

    (3)     An application for entry clearance is made on the date on which
       payment of the relevant fee is made.  If  the  application  is  made
       online, and payment  of  the  relevant  fee  is  also  made  online,
       contemporaneously with submission of  the  online  application,  the
       date of application is the date of submission.  If  payment  of  the
       relevant fee is not made  until  the  printed  application  form  is
       submitted, the date of application is the date on  which  those  are
       handed over.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO") appeals with permission against the
    determination of  Judge  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Callender-Smith
    allowing the appeal against the ECO's  decision  to  refuse  her  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as  a  domestic  worker  in  a  private
    household as provided for in paragraph 159A of the Immigration Rules.

 2. For clarity, I shall refer to Ms Kaur who was the appellant before  the
    First-tier Tribunal, but who is the respondent in this appeal,  as  the
    claimant.

 3. The claimant was employed by Baljinder Singh in  a  house  he  owns  in
    India; he is resident in the United  Kingdom.  She  applied  for  entry
    clearance to take up an offer of employment in his home in  the  United
    Kingdom. That application was, it is claimed, made on 4 April 2012. She
    was interviewed in connection with the application on 9 April 2012 when
    she handed over various documents and paid the application fee.

 4. The respondent refused the application on 20 April 2012  (applying  the
    immigration rules in force from 6 April 2012) as she was not satisfied,
    with reference to  paragraph  159A  of  the  Rules  that  the  claimant
    intended to stay in the United Kingdom for a limited  period,  or  that
    the employer was qualified to sponsor the application as his  permanent
    place of residence was in the United Kingdom. It was  also  refused  as
    the claimant was to be paid ï¿½59.26 per month,  considerably  less  than
    the UK national minimum wage, contrary to a  requirement  of  paragraph
    159A of the Rules in effect from 6 April.

 5. The claimant appealed against that decision, submitting:
     i. That the application had been made before 5 April 2012 and for that
        reason she benefitted  from  transitional  provisions  whereby  her
        application should have been  considered  under  the  Rules  as  in
        effect  on that date [5];

    ii. That the contract specifies that she is to be paid the minimum wage
        [6]; and,

   iii. That there is evidence that the  applicant's  employer  travels  to
        India regularly where he has family financial interests [7].


 6. In the Entry Clearance Manager's review it is stated that it  has  long
    been established that an application is not legally  lodged  until  the
    fee is paid and in this case, that occurred after the rules changed. It
    is also stated that "it is unfortunate that the  commercial  partner[1]
    erroneously took in the application under the old rules, and failed  to
    advise of the rule change, and  accepted  the  old,  higher,  long-term
    fee".

 7. The appeal was heard by the judge of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  on  12
    October 2012. Both parties were represented.   The  judge  allowed  the
    appeal under the Rules to the limited extent that it is  as  stated  in
    paragraph 24 of his determination "remitted to the respondent to make a
    lawful decision." The judge found:

     i. The application had been submitted online on 4 April 2012 [18];

    ii. The applicant was interviewed on 9 April 2012 [19];

   iii. The issue in the appeal turns on  when  the  application  was  made
        [17], it being clear that she would succeed if the rules  in  place
        on 4 April 2012 were applied [16], [17];

    iv. It is arguable that the matter falls to be decided on the rules  in
        force from 6 April 2012 [20] as the claimant did not  pay  for  her
        application on 4 April 2012;

     v. the basis of the refusal was not  a  failure  to  comply  with  the
        express requirements of the immigration rules  and,  following  the
        decisions in Pankina v SSHD [2010] EWCA Civ 719  and  Alvi   [2012]
        UKSC 33, the application should not have been  refused  simply  for
        non-compliance with guidance [21];

    vi. Accordingly, the decision was not in accordance with  the  law  and
        was to be considered again by the respondent [23].


 8. Permission to  appeal  was  granted  by  Designated  Judge  Murray  who
    considered that it was arguable that the judge should  have  considered
    the appeal based on paragraph 159A of the Immigration  Rules  as  at  6
    April and made a decision to allow or dismiss the appeal.

 9. Directions were  then  given  requiring  the  parties  to  address  the
    following issues:


     a. The date on which the application to the ECO was made.
     b. Whether, with regard to paragraph 30 of the Immigration Rules,  any
        fee was payable under the Consular Fees Act 1980.
     c. Under which Act, Regulation or Order,  Entry  Clearance  fees  were
        payable in this case.
     d. Whether,  if  the  application  was  made  on  4  April  2012,  the
        application fell within the transitional provisions set out  in  HC
        1888; and, if so
     e. Whether the application met the  requirements  of  the  Immigration
        Rules in force on 4 April 2012.
    Did the determination of the First-tier Tribunal involve the making  of
    an error of law?

10. I am satisfied that it did. Prior to 6 April 2012,  paragraph  159A  of
    the Rules provided, so far as is relevant:

    159A.   The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter
          the United Kingdom as a domestic worker in a private household are
          that he:

    (ii)  has been employed as a domestic worker for one year or more
    immediately prior to application for entry clearance under the same
    roof as his employer or in a household that the employer uses for
    himself on a regular basis and where there is evidence that there is a
    connection between employer and employee;

      ...
    (iv)  intends to work full time as a domestic worker under the same
    roof as his employer or in a household that the employer uses for
    himself on a regular basis and where . . .

11. Paragraph 159A of the Immigration Rules as in force from 6  April  2012
    provides ( so far as is relevant to this appeal) as follows:-

    159A. The requirements to be met by a person seeking leave to enter the
        United Kingdom as a domestic worker in a private household are that
        the applicant:
    ...
    (ii) has been employed as a  domestic  worker  for  one  year  or  more
       immediately prior to the application for entry clearance  under  the
       same roof as the employer or in a household that the  employer  uses
       for himself on a regular basis and where evidence in  the  form  set
       out in guidance published by the UK Border  Agency  is  produced  to
       demonstrate the connection between employer and employee; and


    ...
    (iv) intends to leave the UK at the end of six  months  in  the  United
       Kingdom or at the same  time  as  the  employer,  whichever  is  the
       earlier; and

      (v) has agreed in writing terms and conditions of employment  in  the
    UK with the employer, as specified in  guidance  published  by  the  UK
    Border Agency, including specifically that the applicant will  be  paid
    in  accordance  with  the  National  Minimum  Wage  Act  1998  and  any
    Regulations made under it, and provides this with the  entry  clearance
    application; and

    ...


12. The significant changes here are the limiting of the period of leave to
    a maximum of  six  months  (159A  (iv)),  and  requirements  to  supply
    evidence as set out in guidance.  Although other requirements  for  the
    contract of employment were set out in guidance, the requirement for an
    applicant to be paid in accordance with the National Minimum  Wage  Act
    1998 was expressly written into the rules (paragraph  159A  (v)).   The
    refusal of entry clearance on the basis that the claimant was not being
    paid the minimum wage was therefore a refusal based on the  rules,  not
    guidance.

13. The judge erred in considering that the requirement to be paid at least
    the minimum wage was imposed by guidance rather than by the immigration
    rules, and thus erred in applying the principles of Pankina  and  Alvi.
    On that basis, the decision must be set aside and that requires  it  to
    be re-made.


    Re-making the decision

14. In re-making the decision, it is  necessary  first  to  consider  which
    Rules were applicable. It is established law that an application is  to
    be decided in accordance with  the  Rules  in  force  at  the  date  of
    decision.  An  exception  to  that  is  where  there  are  transitional
    provisions.

15. The Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules HC 1888, published on  12
    March 2012 made substantial changes to paragraph 159A with effect  from
    6 April 2012.  HC 1888 includes the following provision:

      "The [...] changes set out in this Statement shall take  effect  on  6
      April 2012. However, if an applicant has made an application for entry
      clearance or leave before 6 April 2012 and  the  application  has  not
      been decided before that date, it will be decided in  accordance  with
      the rules in force on 5 April 2012."

16. It is not in dispute that the claimant  met  the  requirements  of  the
    Rules  in  force  at  5  April  2012,  or  that  she  cannot  meet  the
    requirements of the Rules in force from 6 April 2012. It  is  therefore
    important to identify when her application was made.  Was  it,  as  she
    contends, 4 April 2012 when an online application  was  submitted?  Or,
    was it, as the ECO contends, 9 April 2012 when the application fee  was
    paid?

17. The starting point is the Rules themselves which define  the  "date  of
    application" in paragraph 6 as follows:

          "date of application" means the date of application determined in
          accordance with paragraph 30 or 34G of these rules as appropriate.

18. The claimant contends that in this case paragraph 30 is applicable  and
    as  there  was  no  fee  payable  under  the  Consular  Fees  Act,  the
    application  was  made   once   submitted   electronically.    In   the
    alternative, it is submitted that  the  electronic  submission  of  the
    application falls within paragraph 34G.

19. Paragraph 30 provides

        30. An application for an entry clearance is not made until any fee
        required to be paid under the Consular Fees Act 1980 (including any
        Regulations or Orders made under that Act) has been paid.

20. Paragraph 34G provides:

        34G.For the purposes of these rules, the date on which an
        application or claim (or a variation in accordance with paragraph
        34E) is made is as follows:

           (i) where the application form is sent by post, the date of
           posting,

           (ii) where the application form is submitted in person, the date
           on which it is accepted by a public enquiry office of the United
           Kingdom Border Agency of the Home Office,

           (iii) where the application form is sent by courier, the date on
           which it is delivered to the United Kingdom Border Agency of the
           Home Office, or

           (iv) where the application is made via the online application
           process, on the date on which the online application is
           submitted.

21. The ECO contends that the fee payable was in effect payable  under  the
    Consular Fees Act, and in  the  alternative  that  the  effect  of  the
    Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2011 (SI  2011/445)("the  Fees
    Order") and the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Regulations 2011 (SI
    2011/1055) ("the Fees Regulations") is that an  application  for  entry
    clearance must be accompanied by a  fee,  if  required  under  the  Fee
    Regulations, and is not validly made unless this is done.

22. Article 3 of the Fees Order provides:

    3.      (1) Applications to which this article applies must be
        accompanied by the fee specified in regulations made under section
        51(3) of the 2006 Act.
        (2) This article applies to applications for
           (a) Leave to remain the United Kingdom
           (b) Entry clearance.

23. Regulation 37 of the Fees Regulation provides:

    37.     Where an application to which these Regulations refer is to  be
        accompanied by a specified fee, the application is not validly made
        unless it has been accompanied by that fee.

Discussion

24. Section 1 of the Consular Fees Act 1980 permits Orders  in  Council  to
    specify the fees  to  be  levied  for  the  carrying  out  of  consular
    functions which includes charging for visas  (see  schedule  1  of  the
    Consular Fees Act 1980).  This power has been exercised  by  Orders  in
    Council issued from time to time, specifying the level of  fees  to  be
    paid  in  conjunction  with  different   types   of   entry   clearance
    applications, the notarisation of  documents  and  similar  activities.
    This is reflected in paragraph 30 of the Immigration Rules as  set  out
    above.

25. The power to charge fees  for  entry  clearance  applications  is  also
    conferred by  sections  51  and  52  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006 which provide for  this  to  be  done  by  way  of
    statutory instrument.  The powers conferred are  without  prejudice  to
    the powers granted by  the  Consular  Fees  Act,  but  that  cannot  be
    construed as an indication that the fees are payable by virtue of  that
    Act. The relevant statutory instruments - the Fees Order and  the  Fees
    Regulations - provide that they are made under the 2006  Act,  not  the
    Consular Fees Act.

26. Article 3 of the Fees Order requires applications for  entry  clearance
    to be accompanied by the fee specified in the Fees Regulations; in this
    case, regulation 25(1)(o) which provides:

      25.   (1) In the case of an application to which article 3(2)(b) of
           the 2011 Order applies, namely an application for entry
           clearance
           ...


           (o) where the application is for entry clearance other than-
                 (i) for the purposes listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (n)...
           the fee is ï¿½265

27.  The  power  to  charge  (and  to  waive)  fees  for  entry   clearance
    applications has been considered by the  High  Court  in  Elmi  v  SSHD
    [2010] EWHC 2775, but the particular issue of the date  of  application
    was not considered there nor was it considered in MA v SSHD [2012] EWHC
    2683 as no issue appears to have been taken about paragraph 30  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

28. The Orders in Council made under the Consular Fees Act  1980  in  force
    since 2008 do not specify fees for  entry  clearance  applications.  It
    follows that if no fee  is  required  under  that  Act,  then  for  the
    purposes of the Rules, the date of application cannot be established by
    reference to a payment of a fee and would, thus, appear to be the  date
    on which the application is submitted, not when any fees (payable under
    another provision) is paid.

29. Although the Rules are to be interpreted in a "common sense" way,  that
    cannot include the  rewriting  needed  for  them  to  provide  that  an
    application is not made until fees payable under  the  Fees  Order  and
    Fees Regulations.

30. The claimant submits that the date on which an  application  for  entry
    clearance is made is therefore  the  date  on  which  it  is  submitted
    online, not the date on which payment of any fee is made and that  such
    an application is an application for the purposes  of  the  immigration
    rules.

31. The difficulty with  this  submission  is  that  it  would  require  an
    application for entry  clearance  to  be  considered  under  the  rules
    without payment of a fee, expressly contrary to regulation  37  of  the
    Fees Regulations. The Fees Order and the Fees Regulations make it clear
    that an application is  not  validly  made  unless  accompanied  by  an
    application fee.  That is  supported  by  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Basnet (validity of application - respondent)  [2012]  UKUT
    00113 (IAC) although in-country applications are not made in  the  same
    way as applications made out of country. At  [20]  in   Basnet  it  was
    stated:

      "[The] validity of the application is determined not  by  whether  the
      fee is actually received but by whether the application is accompanied
      by [emphasis added] a valid authorisation to  obtain  the  entire  fee
      that is available in the relevant bank account."

32. The phrase "accompanied by" requires closer analysis in the context  of
    entry clearance applications as  the  system  for  applying  for  Entry
    Clearance does not operate in the same way as in-country  applications;
    the means by which those are processed are set out in detail in Basnet.



33. Where payment of a fee is required for an  in-country  application,  if
    the application is made by post  either  a  cheque  is  sent  with  the
    application form, or authority to make  deductions  from  a  credit  or
    debit card is given as part of the form. If the application is made  in
    person, payment is taken at the appointment.

34. In contrast, in the case of an application for entry clearance, payment
    of a fee is a separate  transaction;  the  application  form  does  not
    provide for payment details. As was acknowledged by both parties and is
    evident from the UKBA website, that whether an application can be  made
    online, and whether payment of any fee can be made online, varies  from
    entry clearance post to entry clearance post. At many posts,  both  the
    application and fee-payment can be done online;  in  others,  only  the
    application; in some, neither can be made online. If submitted  online,
    the print-out of the form must be signed and sent to the  ECO.  Payment
    may (if not already made) be sent at the same  time.  This  is  not  in
    dispute, and is evident from the information publicly available on  the
    UK Visas website.

35. Where an application is submitted  online  and  payment  is  also  made
    online  contemporaneously,  it  would  be  taking  an  overly   literal
    interpretation of regulation 37 to consider that  such  an  application
    had not been "accompanied by" payment, nor has such  an  interpretation
    been canvassed by the ECO. Such a  literal  interpretation  would  mean
    that an online application combined with online payment could never  be
    valid as at no stage would it be physically accompanied by payment.

36. In contrast, where there has been an online  application  and  a  later
    delivery of payment, it cannot  reasonably  be  said  that  the  online
    application is accompanied by payment; there is insufficient  proximity
    in time. It follows that in this scenario, the  online  application  is
    not accompanied by payment, and so is not valid. An  application  which
    does not comply with a statutory requirement necessary  for  it  to  be
    valid is a nullity unless otherwise provided for.  That said, an online
    application, once printed out and signed, then lodged  with  a  payment
    would be accompanied by a fee, and so would be a valid application.

37. The claimant submits that an application could, where the fee  is  paid
    later, be deemed to have been made when the form was sent,  but  absent
    any express provision to that effect, giving retrospective effect to an
    application invalid at the time of its submission, I am  not  satisfied
    that the relevant statutory instruments permit such an  interpretation,
    nor despite Mr Sharma's submissions, that paragraph 34G and  associated
    provisions  of  the  Rules  are  relevant  to  the  issues  of   online
    applications for entry clearance or  otherwise  of  assistance  in  his
    argument.

38. Mr Sharma submits that paragraph 34G(iv) can be  construed  to  include
    applications made overseas  but  I  consider  that  it  cannot  do  so.
    Although in isolation the phrase "the online application process" might
    appear to cover overseas application, as this phrase in rule 34G is not
    qualified by "relevant" (as appears in rule  A34),  the  difficulty  is
    that "relevant" is necessary in rule A34 because that  paragraph  makes
    provision for  several  slightly  different  processes  for  applicants
    within Tier 2,  Tier  5  and  the  dependants  of  both.  Further,  and
    importantly, the overseas online application process is nowhere set out
    in the immigration rules.

39. A further reason for doubting this construction suggested by Mr  Sharma
    is the effect of applying paragraphs 34A  to  34G  to  entry  clearance
    applications to which they were not intended to apply.  The  provisions
    at 34A to D set out requirements in respect of prescribed forms.  There
    is no indication that at the time this application was made, there  was
    a specified form in place. Indeed, as  is  clear  from  the  claimant's
    application as generated by the online system, it  is  not  a  form  as
    such, and is different in character from those forms used in-country.

40. To summarise, the position is this:

        i. The date on which an application for entry clearance is made  is
           not  effectively  established  by  paragraph  30  or  any  other
           provisions of the Immigration Rules, and  has  therefore  to  be
           established by reference to statute and secondary legislation;

       ii. An application for entry clearance that does not comply with the
           requirement in regulation 37 of the Immigration and  Nationality
           (Fees) Regulations 2011 (SI  2011/1055)  to  be  accompanied  by
           payment of a fee is a nullity - it is not an application for the
           purpose of the immigration rules or any statutory provisions;

      iii. An application for entry clearance is made on the date on  which
           payment of the relevant fee is made. If the application is  made
           online, and payment of the relevant fee  is  also  made  online,
           contemporaneously with submission of the online application, the
           date of application is the date of submission. If payment of the
           relevant fee is not made until the printed application  form  is
           submitted, the date of application is the date  on  which  those
           are handed over.

41. It follows from this that as the signed application form and  fee  were
    not in this case handed over until 9 April 2012, that is  the  date  of
    application.  The  claimant   cannot   therefore   benefit   from   the
    transitional arrangements. The ECO did, therefore,  apply  the  correct
    rules and, as accepted, the appellant could not meet  the  requirements
    of paragraph 159A as in force at the date of decision, and  the  appeal
    under the immigration rules must be dismissed.







    Is the decision otherwise in accordance with the law?


42. Mr Sharma for the claimant submitted that the decision under appeal  is
    not lawful as the claimant was led  to  believe  that  her  application
    would be treated as an application under the former  rules,  given  the
    actions of the ECO's commercial partner in  accepting  the  application
    under the  rules  in  place  until  5  April  2012,  and  it  would  be
    conspicuously unfair and unreasonable to consider her application under
    the rules in force from 6 April 2012, and therefore not  in  accordance
    with the law.

43. It is not disputed  that  the  application  here  was  treated  by  the
    commercial partner as an application for entry clearance as a long-term
    domestic worker, as provided for in the rules in force  until  5  April
    2012. Nor is it disputed that the fee payable for  entry  clearance  in
    that category was higher than that charged for entry clearance  in  the
    new, short-term domestic worker category (which replaces the  long-term
    domestic worker category) and was the basis on  which  the  application
    was considered.

44. The ECM review states:

    "It is unfortunate the  commercial  partner  erroneously  took  in  the
    application under the old category and in so doing failed to advise her
    of the rule change and accepted the higher long-term fee. I accept  she
    has a prima facie cause for complaint in this regard but not that it be
    addressed by the issue of a visa in a category that did  not  exist  at
    the time of application."

45. Mr Allan for the ECO submitted that it is inadvisable to apply  private
    law  concepts  such  as  contract,  or  principal  and  agent,  to  the
    relationship between the respondent and its commercial partner  as  the
    powers of an immigration officer or the Secretary of State,  are  given
    by statute. They are delegated powers, and, absent a power to do so,  a
    holder  of  a  delegated  power  may  not  delegate  it   to   another.
    Consequently, the commercial partner is not the agent of the  ECO,  and
    was not capable of binding him.

46. It is not disputed that the commercial partner was contracted to  carry
    out certain functions on behalf of the ECO. I consider that there is  a
    power to do so, and it is not contrary to general principles of  public
    law that a public body may contract with another; that is  implicit  in
    Flanagan v South Bucks District Council [2002] EWCA Civ 690.

47. In the circumstances where the  commercial  partner  was  accepting  an
    application and  were  acting  within  the  ordinary  course  of  their
    business, I am persuaded that they  had  the  ostensible  authority  to
    accept the claimant's application in the manner in which they did.

48. I accept that an agent cannot bind his principal to do  what  is  ultra
    vires and arguably cannot bind  his  principal  by  exceeding  his  own
    authority if  that  authority  is  circumscribed  by  statute.  Neither
    proposition is applicable here. Given the breadth of  discretion  given
    to the Secretary of State and thus to the ECO to waive requirements  of
    the immigration rules, I am not persuaded that there was an ultra vires
    promise here. In any event, there has been detriment  to  the  claimant
    who was charged a higher fee, and there is no evidence  that  there  is
    any detrimental effect on a third party.

49. In the circumstances, given the acceptance of the  application  as  one
    under the prior Rules and the acceptance of a  higher  fee  I  consider
    that the claimant was, in the circumstances of this case,  entitled  to
    infer that discretion had been exercised in her favour  such  that  her
    application would be considered under the Rules in  force  on  5  April
    2012. I consider also that, on the particular facts of  this  case,  it
    was in all the circumstances, conspicuously unfair to do otherwise, and
    thus the decision was unlawful. I therefore allow the  appeal  on  that
    ground.

50. Given the acceptance that the appellant would  have  succeeded  in  her
    application had the Rules in force as at 5 April 2012 been  applied,  I
    consider that it is, in the particular circumstances  of  this  appeal,
    appropriate to direct that the appellant be granted entry clearance  as
    a domestic worker on that basis.

51. It is regrettable that  for  whatever  reason,  paragraph  30  was  not
    amended in 2008 when the Secretary of State ceased to  use  her  powers
    under the  Consular  Fees  Act  1980  to  charge  for  Entry  Clearance
    applications, using instead her powers under the 2006 Act.  While it is
    a matter for her, it may be appropriate now to amend  paragraph  30  of
    the immigration rules to reflect the current position; it may  also  be
    appropriate  for  the  overseas  online  application  procedure  to  be
    underpinned by the immigration  rules,  as  is  the  in-country  online
    application procedure, to ensure legal certainty.

SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS

    1. The determination of the First-tier Tribunal did involve the  making
       of an error of law and I set it aside.

    2. I re-make the determination of the First-tier Tribunal by dismissing
       the appeal under the immigration rules but allowing it on the  basis
       that the decision to refuse entry clearance was  not  in  accordance
       with the law.

    3. I direct that the claimant be granted entry clearance as a  domestic
       worker.
