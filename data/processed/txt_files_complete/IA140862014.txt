For the Respondent:    Ms Shaw, Counsel instructed by Hilcrest Solicitors
LLP


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1. The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date  of  birth  31  January
       1984.  On the 18 November 2014  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  LK
       Gibbs) allowed his appeal against a decision to refuse  to  vary  his
       leave and to remove him from the United Kingdom pursuant  to  s47  of
       the Immigration Asylum and Nationality Act  2006.  The  Secretary  of
       State now has permission to appeal against that decision[1].

    2. The subject of  the  appeal  was  the  Respondent's  application  for
       further leave to remain as  a  Tier  1  (Entrepeneur)  Migrant.  That
       application had been rejected because the  documents  submitted  with
       the application had not  demonstrated  that  he  held  the  requisite
       �50,000 in funds.   At  the  appeal  hearing  before  the  First-tier
       Tribunal his Counsel had accepted that this was so;  it  was  however
       submitted that the Respondent had  been  the  victim  of  poor  legal
       representation. The Secretary of State had emailed  the  Respondent's
       then representatives asking for further documentation  and  they  had
       failed to respond: it was common ground that had they  done  so  they
       could have provided the specified  documentation  to  show  that  the
       Respondent did indeed have the �50,000  in  funds[2],  and  that  the
       application would therefore have been successful.

    3. It was this unfortunate failure of the representatives  which  formed
       the basis of the Respondent's second ground of appeal:  that  he  had
       established a private life in the UK worthy of  protection  and  that
       his appeal should be allowed on Article 8 grounds.

    4. The First-tier Tribunal found that as a matter of  common  sense  the
       Respondent must have established a private life since his arrival  in
       2007, and proceeded straight to consideration of whether the decision
       is proportionate.  The Tribunal  directed  itself  to  s117B  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  At paragraph 15 of the
       determination it says the following:

           "15. In considering  the  public  interest  in  the  appellant's
           removal I have given weight to the fact that he speaks  English,
           is integrated and  is  financially  independent.  I  also  place
           weight on the fact that he has invested money in the UK  through
           paying his tuition fees and also intends to invest further  with
           this entrepreneur application. This  is,  I  find,  all  in  the
           public interest. He remained legally in the  UK  throughout  his
           time here, and for the reasons I have set out above  only  finds
           himself in this position because of shoddy  representation.  His
           immigration status has never been 'precarious'"

    5. Having made reference to CDS (Brazil) [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC)  it  goes
       on:

           "17. Although in this  case  the  appellant  has  completed  his
           course of study I find that he has a legitimate  further  avenue
           available to him, which is an avenue which I  find  will  create
           economic benefit to the UK. There are no countervailing  factors
           as I have outlined above and although I  have  of  course  given
           weight to the fact that  his  application  was  refused  by  the
           respondent  the  reality  is  that  he  is  able  to  meet   the
           requirements of the Immigration Rules, and through no  fault  of
           his own was prevented from providing the necessary documents  to
           prove this.

           18. In these particular circumstances I am  persuaded  that  the
           appellant's removal is disproportionate when weighed against the
           public interest of maintaining immigration control"

    6. The appeal was allowed on human rights grounds for those reasons.

       Error of Law

    7. The Secretary of State contends that the First-tier Tribunal erred in
       law in the approach taken  to  s117B.  For  the  Respondent  Ms  Shaw
       concedes that this is so. The Respondent's leave was,  at  all  times
       since his arrival in 2007 "precarious": see AM (s117B) Malawi  [2015]
       UKUT 0260 (IAC). As such  the  Tribunal  should  only  have  attached
       little weight to his private life.

    8. The Tribunal also fell into error by failing  to  identify  what  the
       interference was. The consequence of this decision may have been that
       the Respondent was required to return  to  Pakistan,  so  permanently
       disrupting his private life in the UK, but  that  was  not  the  only
       outcome. He may, for instance, have made a new application for  leave
       to enter or remain, which would, on the facts as  found,  have  every
       chance of success.  This error led to a further omission:  a  failure
       to make findings on what the consequences were  for  the  Respondent.
       In the  absence  of  a  finding  that  there  would  be  any  adverse
       consequences at  all  (bar  the  inconvenience  and  expense)  it  is
       difficult to see how the decision, made in accordance with the Rules,
       was disproportionate.

    9. The decision to  allow  the  appeal  on  human  rights  grounds  must
       therefore be set aside.

       The Re-Making

   10. Although there was no cross-appeal against the  decision  to  dismiss
       the appeal under the Rules, Ms Shaw sought to  persuade  me  that  in
       fact the appeal could have been allowed on that basis, and invited me
       to remit the matter to the First-tier Tribunal to enable her  to  run
       her argument there. Mr Clarke understandably objected to this  course
       of action. The determination clearly records that the Respondent  had
       not pursued his case under the Rules: it would be procedurally unfair
       if he were allowed to re-open it now.  I agree  with  Mr  Clarke.  If
       there was a case under the Rules it should have been  pursued  before
       the First-tier Tribunal. The appeal was dismissed on that  basis  and
       there being no appeal against that decision this Tribunal has not the
       vires to interfere with it.

   11. In respect of the human rights appeal my decision can be gleaned from
       the reasoning above. The Respondent has not  established  that  there
       would be a permanent - or even significant -  interference  with  his
       Article 8 rights as a result of this decision. It is always  open  to
       him to make a new application in order to extend his stay in the  UK,
       returning to Pakistan and making an application for  entry  clearance
       if  necessary.   I  know  that  this  decision  results  in  expense,
       inconvenience and no doubt frustration for the  Respondent,  who  has
       always intended to do the right thing  and  comply  with  the  Rules.
       These are however the unfortunate consequences of s85A NIAA  2002,  a
       statutory provision approved by  parliament.  There  is  no  evidence
       before me to suggest that there would be any  particularly  harsh  or
       compelling consequences  arising  from  the  decision  and  in  those
       circumstances the appeal cannot be allowed under Article 8.

       Decisions

   12. The determination contains an error of law and the decision to  allow
       the appeal under Article 8 is set aside.

   13. I re-make the decision by  dismissing  the  appeal  on  human  rights
       grounds.
