Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Sharma, instructed by Paul John & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

   1. The appellant is a citizen of India, born  on  13  October  1983.  She
      arrived in the UK on 22 February 2011 with leave as a Tier  4  student
      until 29 June 2012. Following an application made on 26 June 2012, she
      was  granted  further  leave  until  14  May  2014.  Her   leave   was
      subsequently curtailed to 20 May 2013, but a further  application  for
      Tier 4 leave was granted and she was given leave to 19 March 2016.  On
      15 August 2014  the  appellant  was  served  with  an  IS151A  removal
      decision. She then made a human rights claim on 15 August 2016,  which
      was refused and certified as clearly unfounded on 5 October 2016.  She
      made a further human rights claim on 5 April 2017 which was refused on
      11 January 2019 with a right of appeal.

   2. In  the  decision  refusing  the  appellant's  claim,  the  respondent
      considered that the suitability provisions in S-LTR.1.6 of Appendix FM
      applied on the basis of the appellant having submitted a  fraudulently
      obtained TOEIC certificate following an English language speaking  and
      writing test  taken  on  23  May  2012  at  Seven  Oaks  College.  The
      appellant's test result had been cancelled by ETS as it was considered
      that she had used a  proxy  test  taker  in  the  speaking  test.  The
      respondent noted that 72% of the speaking and writing tests  taken  on
      that day were deemed invalid as having been obtained by the use  of  a
      proxy and 28% were questionable. None of the results were released  by
      ETS as reliable  and  the  respondent  considered  that  the  evidence
      therefore demonstrated that Seven Oaks College was not operating under
      genuine test conditions on the date the appellant took her test. As  a
      result, the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant's presence
      in the UK was conducive to  the  public  good.  The  respondent  found
      further that the appellant's relationship with  her  partner  did  not
      meet the eligibility requirements of Appendix FM and considered  there
      to be no evidence of very  significant  obstacles  to  integration  in
      India for the purposes  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)  of  the  immigration
      rules. It was  considered  further  that  there  was  no  evidence  of
      exceptional circumstances entitling the appellant to leave outside the
      immigration rules.

   3. The appellant appealed against that decision. Her appeal  was  allowed
      by First-tier Tribunal Judge Sweet in  a  decision  promulgated  on  6
      September 2019. The judge considered that the respondent had failed to
      discharge the burden of proving fraud. He relied upon  the  report  of
      the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) in concluding that there were
      considerable flaws in the  respondent's  evidence  about  proxy  test-
      takers. He considered that the appellant was a  credible  witness,  he
      noted that she had taken studies in India and in the UK in English and
      he concluded that her application should not  have  been  rejected  on
      suitability  grounds.  He  also  concluded  that   there   were   very
      significant obstacles to the appellant's integration in India  because
      of the length of time she had been in the UK.

   4. The Secretary of State sought, and was granted, permission  to  appeal
      to the Upper Tribunal against Judge Sweet's decision. The matter  came
      before Upper Tribunal Judge Kamara on 27 February 2020, to decide  the
      error of law question.

   5. In a decision promulgated on 4 March 2020 UTJ  Kamara  found  material
      errors of law in the judge's decision, on the grounds that  the  judge
      had failed to engage with the findings, and follow the guidance, in SM
      and Qadir v Secretary of State for the Home Department (ETS - Evidence
      - Burden of Proof) [2016] UKUT 229 and Secretary of State for the Home
      Department v Shehzad & Anor [2016] EWCA Civ 615 and had failed to say
      anything to justify departing from those authorities; and that he  had
      given  inadequate  reasons  for  concluding   that   the   appellant's
      application was wrongly refused on suitability grounds. UTJ Kamara set
      aside the decision in its entirety and directed that it be re-made  at
      a resumed hearing in the Upper Tribunal on another date.

   6. The matter then came before me. Mr Tufan applied for an adjournment to
      await  the  final  decision  of  the  Upper  Tribunal  following   the
      preliminary decision in DK and RK (Parliamentary privilege;  evidence)
      India [2021] UKUT 61. Mr Sharma was neutral in the matter although  he
      was content to proceed with  the  appeal  and  pointed  out  that  the
      appellant had been waiting for a lengthy period of time to resolve her
      case. I decided that an adjournment was not necessary  at  this  point
      and that it was appropriate to proceed to hear the appeal.

   7. The appellant gave oral evidence before me, confirming  that  she  had
      booked her TOEIC test by attending the college in person at the end of
      April 2012 and had attended four day-long classes in  preparation  for
      the test at the college. The  college,  Seven  Oaks  College,  was  in
      central London. She travelled to the college for the classes by  train
      to Chancery Lane or Holborn and then took a taxi to the  college.  She
      paid around �250 for the classes and the tests together, all in  cash.
      She was given a receipt but had since lost it. The appellant explained
      that there were about ten people in the room taking the test, although
      there were more than that present at the college overall. She did  not
      know if any cheating was taking place in the other rooms and  was  not
      aware of any cheating  in  her  room.  She  explained  that  she  wore
      headphones, through which she was given instructions, and the relevant
      questions appeared  on  the  computer  screen.  She  spoke  through  a
      microphone. The  appellant  explained  the  content  of  some  of  the
      questions and how she answered. She said  that  she  had  studied  and
      practised nursing in India and had worked as a health  care  assistant
      in the UK, conversing in English. She had taken the first  year  of  a
      CIMA course, in English, but had been unable to complete the next  two
      years because her visa was cancelled. When she  received  the  removal
      decision advising her that she  had  exercised  deception,  she  tried
      calling the college  but  there  was  no  answer.  She  spoke  to  the
      receptionist of the building where the college  was  located  but  was
      told that the college's licence had been cancelled.  Her  husband  had
      returned to India three years ago.

   8. When cross-examined by Mr Tufan the appellant said that  she  and  her
      husband had a daughter who was born in 2008 and was  living  with  her
      parents in India. She said that she travelled to the tests by  car   -
      her friend's black BMW - rather than using the train as she was afraid
      of delays if she took the train. She was living  with  her  friend  in
      Haywards Heath and he looked after her. He parked in the  car  parking
      area next to the college and waited for her whilst she did the test.

   9. The appellant's  friend,  Mr  Nelson  Chummar  Poyappdamam  then  gave
      evidence before me. He confirmed that he drove the  appellant  to  the
      college  and  saw  her  enter  the  building.  The  college   was   in
      Millharbour, not far from the London Eye, in Central London. They were
      living together and he used to see her studying for the test. She  and
      her husband were living with him at the time. She was not the kind  of
      person to cheat. In  response  to  Mr  Tufan's  cross-examination,  Mr
      Poyappdamam said that the car park was near to the  test  centre,  but
      was separate from it. He waited for the appellant in the car park.

  10. Both parties then made submissions.

  11. Mr Tufan relied upon the refusal decision and the respondent's written
      submissions previously produced by Mr Stephen Whitwell. He referred to
      the statistics for the college showing the  percentages  of  the  test
      results found to be invalid and relied upon the evidence of  Professor
      French which found there to be only a  2%  chance  of  false  negative
      results. Mr Tufan pointed out that the appellant's  level  of  English
      was not as fluent as had been suggested and several questions had  had
      to be repeated for her. There was no reason why the appellant went  to
      Chancery Lane or Holborn station from Haywards Heath in order  to  get
      to the college. Mr Tufan asked me  to  find  that  the  appellant  had
      cheated in her test and that the appeal had to be dismissed.  Even  if
      it was found that she had not cheated,  the  appeal  should  still  be
      dismissed as there was no established family or private life here.

  12. Mr Sharma conceded that the respondent had met the initial  burden  of
      proof, following the decision in SM and Qadir, subject to the decision
      in DK and RK,  but  submitted  that  the  appellant  had  provided  an
      innocent explanation. The  amount  of  detail  she  had  provided  was
      consistent with someone who had taken the test and  she  had  given  a
      credible explanation as to how she travelled to the  test  centre.  As
      for the third stage of the  relevant  test,  the  appellant  had  been
      taught in English prior to coming to the UK and had studied in English
      after coming to the UK, including taking  the  CIMA  examinations  for
      which she had received high  scores  in  most  of  the  subjects.  Her
      fluency in English may have been adversely  affected  by  the  lengthy
      period she had been in limbo  here,  unable  to  work  or  study.  The
      statistics for Seven Oaks College suggested that  the  college  itself
      was 'dodgy' and, as such, the information they provided could  not  be
      trusted. The Secretary of State was unable to show that the test score
      was invalidated because of cheating or because the college was  dodgy.
      Mr Sharma relied upon Professor French's  report  in  submitting  that
      there was a very good  chance  that  the  appellant's  microphone  had
      picked up another voice in the room leading to the conclusion  that  a
      proxy was used and that there was a lack of training for the listeners
      including  training  on  foreign  accents.  He  submitted   that   the
      respondent had failed to provide a consistent account of the source of
      the information in Annex A. The evidence  was  only  as  good  as  its
      source and Seven Oaks College could not be trusted.

  13. Mr Sharma submitted that the appeal  should  be  resolved  by  finding
      that: the respondent had failed to discharge the burden of proving the
      deception allegation; that in line with the decision in  Ahsan  v  The
      Secretary of State for the Home Department (Rev  1)  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
      2009 the appellant's Article 8 rights were engaged and had been since
      2014 when the respondent had made an improper removal  decision;  that
      the refusal of the human rights claim  was  materially  based  on  the
      unfounded ETS allegation; and, in line with Khan & Ors v Secretary  of
      State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1684 and the Home Office
      ETS policy the appellant was entitled  to  leave  to  remain  and  the
      refusal of her human rights claim was unlawful. The appeal  should  be
      allowed on that basis.

Consideration and findings

  14. Mr Sharma properly conceded that the first stage of the test in SM and
      Qadir was met and that the respondent had provided sufficient evidence
      to meet the initial burden of proof. The burden therefore  shifted  to
      the appellant to provide an innocent explanation in  response  to  the
      allegation of cheating. Mr Sharma submitted  that  the  appellant  had
      provided such an explanation whereas Mr Tufan submitted that  she  had
      not. Having heard  from  the  appellant  and  her  friend  and  having
      considered all the evidence, both oral  and  documentary,  I  have  to
      agree with Mr Tufan that the appellant has  failed  to  discharge  the
      burden of proof upon her, even to the basic level of plausibility.

  15. The evidence relied upon by the respondent which was specific  to  the
      appellant consists of the ETS TOEIC Test Centre Lookup Tool for  Seven
      Oaks College and the ETS Selt Source Data showing the appellant's test
      score to be invalid. The statistics in the Lookup Tool for the  status
      of the TOEIC tests taken at Seven Oaks College paint a dismal picture,
      showing that on the date the appellant took her second  test,  23  May
      2012, 72% of all tests (64 out of 89 tests) that day were found by ETS
      to be invalid and 28% (25 out of 89  tests)  were  questionable,  with
      none being released. In addition, the statistics showed  that  without
      specifying a date, 67% of the total tests taken (708 out of 1051) were
      invalid and 33% (343 out of 1051) were questionable.  The  appellant's
      evidence was, furthermore, that Seven Oaks College had had its licence
      revoked.

  16. The case put for the appellant in response  to  these  statistics  was
      that this was a matter of a college being "dodgy", but  not  that  the
      appellant had cheated  herself.  In  support  of  this,  reliance  was
      placed, aside from the appellant's past and  current  ability  in  the
      English language, upon her description of  the  journey  to  the  test
      centre, her attendance at classes in preparation for the tests and the
      process of taking the speaking test, which were  said  to  demonstrate
      that she had genuinely undertaken the test herself. I accept that  the
      appellant did indeed provide a detailed description  in  that  regard.
      However, in the absence of any  supporting  evidence  other  than  her
      friend's account of having seen her studying and having driven her  to
      the test and back, the appellant's own description is limited  in  the
      weight that it can be accorded when there are otherwise parts  of  her
      evidence that are of concern.

  17. One area of concern was the appellant's account of her journey to  the
      college and the location of the college. Neither the appellant nor her
      friend was able to give anything other than a very  vague  account  of
      the area where the college was. The appellant stated that she  took  a
      train from her friend's house in Hayward's Heath to Chancery  Lane  or
      Holborn station and then took a taxi to the college to attend the four
      days of classes at the college. She was able to recall that  the  taxi
      took about ten minutes and that the fare was about �6  but  could  not
      say where the college was, other than central London. Her friend,  who
      had driven her to the test and back on two different days,  said  that
      the college was in  Millharbour,  in  the  area  of  the  London  Eye.
      However, Millharbour is not near the London  Eye  and  neither  is  it
      anywhere near Chancery Lane or Holborn stations. Neither is there  any
      plausible explanation as to why the appellant would have taken a train
      to Chancery Lane or Holborn if she was travelling from Haywards  Heath
      to the college in Millharbour,  a  point  made  by  Mr  Tufan  in  his
      submissions. The appellant explained that she took  a  taxi  from  the
      train station because she did not have a smartphone at that  time  and
      had only recently come to the UK and was only familiar with  her  home
      and the college, yet she had in fact been living in the UK for over  a
      year by that stage.

  18. Another concern is that, when asked by Mr Tufan  what  steps  she  had
      taken to speak to ETS or the college after she found out that her visa
      had been cancelled on the basis of an  allegation  of  deception,  the
      appellant said that she tried to call  the  college  but  received  no
      answer and managed to speak to a receptionist in  the  building  where
      the college was located who told her  that  it  had  had  its  licence
      cancelled. She gave no explanation why she did not try to contact  ETS
      or to clear her name by other means. Indeed, when she was asked by  Mr
      Tufan, twice, what steps she had taken to  challenge  the  allegation,
      she failed to provide a proper response,  but  simply  asked  why  ETS
      issued her with a certificate if she had cheated and why did they  not
      let her take another English examination and give her  another  chance
      as she had spent a lot of money.

  19. It is argued on behalf of the appellant that  she  had  no  reason  to
      cheat because she had  previously  and  subsequently  established  her
      English language ability to a sufficient level to enable her  to  pass
      such a test herself. In that regard  the  appellant  relies  upon  the
      various  certificates  and  qualifications  in   her   appeal   bundle
      confirming her high school studies and her studies in nursing in India
      conducted in the English language,  together  with  a  previous  IELTS
      test, her work in the UK as a  health  care  assistant  and  her  CIMA
      examination results. The latter were,  however,  conducted  two  years
      after the TOEIC test was taken and, in any event, the decision  in  MA
      (ETS - TOEIC testing) Nigeria [2016] UKUT 450 found that "there  is  a
      range of reasons why persons proficient in English may engage in TOEIC
      fraud". I also have to agree with Mr Tufan that the appellant's  level
      of English at the hearing was such that on occasions questions had  to
      be repeated and the answers did  not  correspond  with  the  questions
      asked. Mr Sharma's response, that her English may have deteriorated as
      a result of not having studied or worked due to being in  limbo  since
      2014, is not a persuasive one.

  20. As for the weaknesses in the  respondent's  evidence  that  have  been
      repeatedly referred to in the relevant authorities and by the experts,
      as referred to in Mr Sharma's skeleton argument at [14] to [21], I  do
      not consider that to be a sufficient answer to the  concerns  in  this
      appellant's case, when considering  the  matters  set  out  above  and
      taking account of the particularly adverse statistics in the  case  of
      Seven Oaks College.

  21. For all of these reasons I simply cannot accept that the appellant has
      provided a sufficiently 'innocent explanation' to discharge the burden
      of  proof  upon  her.  Even  according  due  weight  to  her  detailed
      description of the test, the overall  picture  is  one  in  which  the
      respondent has discharged both the  evidential  and  legal  burden  of
      proving cheating. For all of those reasons it seems to me,  therefore,
      that the respondent was entitled  to  conclude  that  the  suitability
      provisions in S-LTR.1.6 of Appendix FM applied such that the appellant
      could not meet the requirements of the immigration rules.

  22. Aside from the suitability provisions  of  the  rules,  the  appellant
      cannot meet  the  eligibility  requirements  in  Appendix  FM  or  the
      requirements in paragraph 276ADE(1) in  any  event.  Her  husband  and
      child are in India and there is no family life  existing  in  the  UK.
      There is no evidence of any very significant obstacles to  integration
      into India. The appellant has spent the majority of her life  in  that
      country and has worked there. There is no reason  why  she  could  not
      find employment there again.  There are  no  compelling  circumstances
      justifying a  grant  of  leave  outside  the  immigration  rules.  The
      appellant has clearly failed to show that the respondent's decision is
      disproportionate and her Article 8 human rights appeal is  accordingly
      dismissed.

DECISION

  23. The making of the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  involved  an
      error on a point of law and has been set aside. I re-make the decision
      by dismissing the appeal.
