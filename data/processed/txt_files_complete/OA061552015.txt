                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India who was born on  10  December  1927
    and he is now 88 years old.  The Secretary of State appeals against the
    determination of Judge Ross promulgated on 5 August 2015 in  which  she
    allowed the appellant's  appeal  against  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer in Bombay to refuse the appellant entry clearance  in
    order to join his son in the United Kingdom.

 2. The circumstances of the case can  be  set  out  by  reference  to  the
    earlier determination of First-tier Tribunal Judge  Blum,  as  he  then
    was, whose determination was promulgated  in  October  2013.   At  that
    stage he had two appellants before him; both the  appellant  before  me
    and his wife.  Both were claiming to come to the United Kingdom  to  be
    looked after by their children. They were both elderly, although Mrs  M
    was slightly younger, and the judge properly determined that there  was
    no reason why, although they were relatively elderly couple, they could
    not properly be provided for physically by care facilities in the  form
    of food, housekeeping and so on. There was therefore no need  for  them
    to come to the United Kingdom in order to pursue their life here  being
    looked after (but not as a matter of absolute need) by their  children.



 3. The situation has changed since that time in that Mrs M has died.   The
    appellant before me is now on his own. He is now  somewhat  older  and,
    importantly, he is now suffering from Alzheimer's.

 4. The Secretary of State has a process which permits individuals to apply
    for entry clearance for the purpose of care provided  by  relatives  in
    the United Kingdom. It is  entirely  for  the  Secretary  of  State  to
    determine whether or not, as a matter of policy,  she  is  prepared  to
    permit such people to enter the United Kingdom, given  that  they  have
    made no contribution to  the  country  by  way  of  national  insurance
    contributions, given the fact that when a son or a daughter decides  to
    leave the country of their origin and leave their parents in  situ,  it
    would have been  open to the Secretary of  State  to  decide  that,  in
    those circumstances, there should be no provision  made  and  that  any
    immigrants to this country, even British citizens, should not  be  able
    to call for their parents to  join them.

 5. However the Secretary of State has not done that  and  has  produced  a
    Rule which permits this to occur in the circumstances set out in  those
    Rules.  They are known as E-ECDR2.4 and E-ECDR2.5.

 6. The requirements are that the applicants,  if  the  sponsor's  parents,
    must as a result  of  age  illness  or  disability  require  long  term
    personal care to perform every day tasks. That was not  the  case  when
    the matter came before Judge Blum. However it is  the  case  now.   The
    evidence of this is provided by Dr Buch who says that  the  Alzheimer's
    disease from which the appellant suffers has reached the stage where he
    needs help even with very basic things such as making  a  cup  of  tea.
    The level of care that is required  is  support  of  a  very  different
    nature from the support provided by Tiffin tins  and  a  maid  to  look
    after him and keep the house in order.

 7. The provisions of E-CDR2.5 require that the applicant  must  be  unable
    even with the practical and financial help of the sponsor to obtain the
    required level of care in the country where they are living, because it
    is not available and there  is  no  person  in  that  country  who  can
    reasonably provide it or it is  not  affordable.  That  requirement  is
    satisfied.  The issue of affordability does not enter into this  appeal
    because it is accepted that the children in  the  United  Kingdom  have
    substantial means.  The  sponsor  is  also  required  to  undertake  to
    provide the care that is needed  without  making  a  call  upon  public
    funds.

 8. Consequently the first issue is whether or not the appellant is  of  an
    age and with an illness or disability which requires long term personal
    care to perform everyday tasks.  I am quite satisfied that this is  the
    case.  He is 88.  He is suffering from Alzheimer's and he is unable  to
    do very basic things like making a cup of  tea.  Indeed  I  asked  Miss
    Isherwood in the course of the argument that if an individual suffering
    from Alzheimer's is not able to establish that he  requires  long  term
    personal care then it is difficult to envisage anybody who does require
    long term personal care to perform everyday tasks.  It seems to me that
    the only stage beyond  the  stage  of  a  person  like  this  appellant
    suffering from Alzheimer's disease is somebody who is in a coma.

 9. The next issue is whether or not that level of care can be provided  by
    the sponsors in the United Kingdom  whilst  the  appellant  remains  in
    India.  The answer is provided in the evidence of Dr Buch. What he says
    is that there are no such facilities available in  India  and  that  in
    particular the facilities in the area in which the appellant lives  are
    inadequate to provide the sort of care which is needed.

10. That is the view of a professional consulting physician with a hospital
    post.  It does not seem to me that the Secretary of State can say  that
    the evidence of Dr Buch can be rejected as being entirely wrong without
    adducing some additional material to back that up.  The judge  accepted
    the evidence. He said at paragraph 9.

         "I am satisfied given the oral evidence of the appellant's sons and
         the medical evidence of Dr Buch that the  appellant  is  unable  to
         obtain the required level of care in India even with the  financial
         support from his sons. The level of care required by the  appellant
         is  not  merely  physical  such  as   cleaning,   housekeeping   or
         administering medication but will involve long term  personal  care
         tailored to mental health issues."

11. That was a finding of fact which was reasonably open to  the  judge  on
    the basis of the evidence of Dr Buch and it cannot be said that it  was
    irrational. It is true that the Secretary of State countered the  claim
    by providing a fact sheet on India in which on pages 9 and 10 there was
    a reference to the facilities available. There is a programme for older
    persons which has been implemented since 1992  with  the  objective  of
    improving the quality of life of senior  citizens  by  providing  basic
    amenities  like  shelter,  food,   medical   care   and   entertainment
    opportunities. It does  not  seem  to  me  this  is  the  same  as  the
    requirements that I have to look at and that  is  whether  there  is  a
    requirement for long term personal care. There  is  also  a  suggestion
    that there are old age homes and day centres and that there are  indeed
    day centres for those  with  Alzheimer's  disease.  A  day  centre  may
    provide respite for persons suffering from Alzheimer's in which he  can
    go and spend some time where  he  is  provided  with  warmth  and  some
    organised activity but that is very different, it  seems  to  me,  from
    long term personal care including help in making cups of tea.   And  so
    the evidence provided by the Entry Clearance Officer simply did not  go
    to the issues in this case.

12. My own sense is that to suggest that the care could be  provided  by  a
    maid at a reasonable cost of ï¿½100 a month, as I think it was suggested,
    does not suffice.  It may have been the  case  that  there  are  agency
    nurses,  that  there  are  trained  carers,  that  there  are   live-in
    practitioners who can go into a person's home, but  once  Dr  Buch  had
    said that these facilities are not available, it  really  required  the
    Entry Clearance Officer to say what facilities that were available  and
    the fact sheet does not provide this.

Notice of Decision

13. For these reasons I am satisfied that  the  Immigration  Judge  on  the
    material before her reached a decision which  was  legally  sustainable
    and it is for those reasons that I dismiss the appeal of the  Secretary
    of State.

14. No anonymity direction is made.
