For the Appellant:     Mr M Rana of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr S Kandola, S.S. Basi & Co Solicitors


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Appellant

 1. The appellant is a citizen of India born on 1st November  1989  and  is
    the wife of the sponsor Ghurav  Sehdev  who  has  indefinite  leave  to
    remain in the United Kingdom.

 2. She made an application for leave to  remain  as  the  partner  of  her
    spouse on 12th April 2013 but the application was refused on  2nd  July
    2013 by the  respondent  further  to  E-LTRP.3.1.  and  E-LTRP.3.3.  of
    Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  It was noted  that  she  had  no
    children and so did not meet the requirements  of  EX.1.(a).   She  had
    claimed to have a genuine and subsisting relationship with her  partner
    but it was not accepted that there were insurmountable obstacles to her
    family life with that partner continuing  outside  the  UK  further  to
    EX.1.(b) and thus she did not meet the requirements of R-LTRPT.1.1.(d).
     Her application was refused under D-LTRP.1.3.

 3. On 19th May 2014 First-tier Tribunal Judge Oakley  allowed  the  appeal
    stating at paragraph 8 of the determination that  pursuant  to  Section
    85(4) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act he could take into
    account  circumstances  relevant  to  the  substance  of  the  decision
    including evidence which concerned a matter arising after the  date  of
    decision.

 4. The judge stated:

         "15. Applying the relevant law  to  the  established  facts  it  is
             necessary for me to determine whether or not there is evidence
             that the Appellant had access to funds in excess of �18,600.

         16.  There had been an explanation given to  the  Respondent  about
             the Sponsor's lower income earnings in the  year  to  5  April
             2013 due to being away for 5 weeks but what had not also  been
             stated was that the Sponsor had had to take further  time  off
             due to illness and although this was not  taken  in  terms  of
             weeks at a time, there were a number of days which the Sponsor
             estimated at around 3 weeks.  I accept that evidence  was  not
             before  the  Respondent  at  the  time  the  application   was
             submitted but I did not find the evidence that I received from
             the  Sponsor  and  the  Appellant  in  that   respect   either
             incredible or implausible and that does provide an explanation
             for the shortfall in what has been agreed by all parties  that
             the Sponsor was in receipt of an annual income at the date  of
             the application of �20,500.

         17.  What is also significant is that a P60 to the  financial  year
             ending 5 April 2014 has been produced and details of that  can
             be taken in to account by me up to the  date  of  the  hearing
             pursuant to Section 85(iv) and that shows that the Sponsor has
             an income of �22,000.

         18.  I therefore accept on the basis of that evidence that  at  the
             time the application was made the Sponsor did have  access  to
             an income of �20,500 but that he did  not  receive  that  full
             income in that tax year for  the  reasons  that  are  set  out
             above.  Furthermore, he has now  had  access  in  the  further
             financial year to funds of over �22,000."

 5. There  was  an  application  for  permission  to  appeal  made  by  the
    respondent on 28th May 2014 on the basis that the  Rules  of  specified
    evidence  were  comprehensively  set  out  in  Appendix  FM-SE  to  the
    Immigration Rules and which  covered  the  evidence  required  and  the
    period and format they should be in.  The Tribunal  had  no  regard  to
    this at paragraphs  15  to  19  and  had  failed  to  comply  with  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Tribunal also had not had appropriate regard to
    the relevant date.  For Appendix FM the significant date is the date of
    application and the significant evidence is from the  specified  period
    before that date.  The Tribunal had not  addressed  the  relevant  date
    from prior to the date of application.

 6. It was not clear what the sponsor's actual gross income annual  was  at
    the date of application although it appeared that the Tribunal accepted
    that for  the  relevant  period  the  requisite  income  could  not  be
    demonstrated as it had not been received by  the  appellant's  sponsor.
    It also followed that the appeal therefore could not be made out.

 7. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Levin  on
    26th June 2014 who agreed that it was arguable that the judge erred  in
    law by failing to consider Appendix FM-SE and to assess the income with
    reference to the date of the application but as he  took  into  account
    the husband's P60 for the following year.

 8. Given that the judge's finding that the husband's  income  was  �20,500
    was made  without  reference  to  or  consideration  of  the  specified
    evidence in Appendix FM and with reference to the husband's P60 for the
    year  following  the  application  both  on   the   grounds   and   the
    determination disclosed an arguable error of law.

The Hearing

 9. Mr Kandola relied on the grounds of the application for  permission  to
    appeal.  The judge had found that the  appellant  had  met  E-LTRP.3.1.
    because the sponsor had a salary in excess of �18,600.  The P60  showed
    he only earned �16,010.87.  He had two periods of unpaid leave  between
    September to October  2012  and  January  to  February  2013  and  this
    accounted for the drop in  income.   There  was  no  exception  to  the
    minimum within the Rules specified  and  nothing  in  the  guidance  to
    assist the appellant.  The Secretary of State did not accept  that  the
    unpaid leave represented a drop.

10. Mr Rana submitted that there was an annual salary letter  which  should
    be considered and further that the appellant had unpaid leave.  In fact
    the Secretary of State did not accept that the  total  leave  of  eight
    weeks, that  is  five  weeks'  holiday  and  three  weeks  being  sick,
    accounted for a drop of �4,000 but  in  any  event  the  P60  from  the
    following year which was  admissible  indicated  that  the  appellant's
    sponsor did earn a salary of �22,000 in the following year.

11. Mr Rana stated that the respondent had not challenged the specifics  of
    the evidence produced under Appendix FM-SE  and  in  fact  referred  to
    various pieces of the evidence.

12. He submitted that Article 8 had not been considered by  the  judge  and
    the appellant was now pregnant.

13. Nancy Kanda, the appellant, was called and confirmed that her baby  was
    due on 15th February 2015.  She did not wish to go back because she did
    not want to leave her husband here and she just wanted to continue life
    here.

14. She produced her NHS records.  These were produced at the  hearing  and
    not in compliance with directions.

15. She confirmed that she had entered the UK in 2001 and that her  parents
    and brother still lived in India and she last saw her parents in  2012.
    She also confirmed that she had previously  had  medical  treatment  in
    India.  Although she had leave as a student when she  met  her  husband
    she had left her studies in 2012.

16. The sponsor, Mr Ghurav Sehdev, attended and  gave  oral  testimony  and
    adopted his statement.  He confirmed  that  he  now  earned  more  than
    �20,000 per annum.

17. The appellant herself confirmed that she had not paid  any  charges  to
    the hospital for her treatment so far but she might  have  to  pay  for
    prescriptions.  She  confirmed  she  had  no  difficulties  at  present
    although she had previously had miscarriages.

18. Mr Kandola submitted that the appellant needed to show exceptional  and
    compelling circumstances which she could not.  She simply wanted to  be
    with her husband.  Her husband could visit her whilst  her  application
    was pending and it would appear from his current income  of  �22,396.78
    per annum that they would have no problems with any future application.

19. Mr Rana submitted that a One-Stop Notice had been served and  therefore
    the appellant should have her application considered at  present  as  a
    spouse.

20. She had passed the English language test and she should have  her  case
    considered on the circumstances as at the hearing.

21. Mr Rana submitted that there  were  exceptional  circumstances  as  the
    appellant had previously had miscarriages.  The appellant's husband did
    earn the requisite annual salary.  People did fall ill and get sick and
    this could qualify  as  an  exceptional  circumstance.   There  was  no
    suggestion that the appellant had stayed here beyond her leave and thus
    she should pay for any medical treatment.

22. I must consider whether there  was  a  burden  on  the  state  but  the
    appellant could now be supported by her husband.  She had hitherto been
    a student with Section 3C leave.  Mr Kandola submitted that the case of
    AS (Afghanistan) and NV (Sri Lanka) [2010] EWCA Civ  1076  referred  to
    additional grounds other than the same grounds of appeal.  This was not
    an additional ground as the appellant had made an  application  on  the
    basis that she was a spouse.







Conclusions

23. The narrow issue in this matter is whether the Immigration Rules  under
    E-LTRP.3.1. are inflexible in  that  the  appellant  must  show  (a)  a
    specified gross annual income of at least (i) �18,600.

24. Alternatively the appellant needs to show that paragraph EX.1.  applies
    further to EX.1.(b) whereby

         "the applicant has a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  a
         partner who is in the UK and is a British Citizen, settled  in  the
         UK or in the UK with refugee leave or humanitarian protection,  and
         there are insurmountable obstacles to family life with that partner
         continuing outside the UK."

25. Judge Oakley at paragraph 16 stated

         "I accept that evidence was not before the respondent at  the  time
         the application was submitted but I did not find the evidence  that
         I received from the sponsor  and  the  appellant  in  that  respect
         either  incredible  or  implausible  and  that  does   provide   an
         explanation for the shortfall  in  what  has  been  agreed  by  all
         parties that the sponsor was in receipt of an annual income at  the
         date of the application of �20,500."

26. The judge had recorded that the appellant's sponsor had gone  to  India
    on two occasions in September and October 2012 and again in January and
    February 2013 and he had taken further time off to assist his wife  and
    this would amount to an additional time of three weeks.

27. The fact is that the evidence was not before the respondent  or  indeed
    the judge that the appellant's sponsor was in receipt  of  �18,600  per
    annum as  at  the  date  of  the  application.   Appendix  FM-SE  makes
    reference to  wage  slips  covering  a  period  of  six  months  if  an
    applicant's sponsor has been employed by their current employer for  at
    least six months, and monthly personal bank statements corresponding to
    the same periods as the wage slips  must  be  produced.   There  is  an
    argument to the effect that the appellant should be able to demonstrate
    the receipt of �9,300 in the  six  months  prior  to  the  application.
    However, this does not diminish the requirement for a  specified  gross
    annual income of at least �18,600 and in this particular  instance  the
    appellant's sponsor could not show that he earned  �9,300  in  the  six
    months prior to the application.  He could not show it because not only
    had he been on holiday in the  six  months  immediately  preceding  the
    application but he had also taken time off to  assist  his  wife.   The
    judge accepted that the evidence was not before the respondent  at  the
    time of the application [16] and also accepted that funds in excess  of
    �18,600 needed to be shown.  I find that this was an error  of  law  in
    his interpretation of the Rules and further in  his  finding  that  the
    date of the hearing was the relevant date.  It  was  the  date  of  the
    application.  I therefore remake the decision.

28. For the reasons given above I do not accept that the sponsor  can  show
    that he earned more than �16,010.87 in the relevant year.  As indicated
    in R(MM (Lebanon)) v SSHD [2014] EWCA Civ 985 there was  a  substantial
    research  undertaken  in  order  to  assess   the   minimum   financial
    requirement  for  a  spouse  MM  (Lebanon)  held  that  the   financial
    requirements in the Immigration rules  regarding  spouses  was  lawful.
    There is a specific exception whereby those with savings  can  make  up
    any shortfall.  The purpose of the Rule is to ensure that  the  partner
    is able to maintain and accommodate themselves  adequately  in  the  UK
    without recourse to public funds.

29. An exception under paragraph 3.1.(c) is  that  the  requirements  under
    paragraph EX.1. apply.  As such the paragraph applies if  EX.1.(b)  the
    applicant has a genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner  who
    is in the UK and is a British citizen, settled in the UK or in  the  UK
    with  refugee  leave  or  humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are
    insurmountable obstacles to family life with  that  partner  continuing
    outside the UK.

30. No evidence was presented to me that  there  was  any  reason  why  the
    family could not relocate to India.  I note that the couple married  in
    India and that  they  both  speak  Punjabi,  English  and  Hindi.   The
    appellant has family in India who could support them on  their  return.
    I accept that the appellant's sponsor has a job here but he was born in
    India and came to the UK and has been here for twelve years.  Even  now
    for the majority of his life he has lived in India.

31. I was presented with medical records to show  that  the  appellant  was
    pregnant but she is in her very early stages of pregnancy and  although
    I accept that she has previously experienced three miscarriages she did
    confirm that she had accessed and received medical treatment previously
    in India and there is confirmation within the papers presented  at  the
    hearing itself from  the  NHS  that  "pregnancy  is  normal"  and  that
    "childbirth is a natural physiological process".

32. I can see that she was at risk of miscarriage but the appellant herself
    confirmed that to date she had not had any difficulties.

33. I  am  therefore  not  persuaded  that  there  are  any  insurmountable
    obstacles, having assessed degree of difficulty the couple face  rather
    than the 'surmountability' of the obstacles, to the appellant returning
    to India to make an application and her husband accompanying her during
    the process if he so wishes.  Alternatively he can keep in contact with
    her during the process via modern methods.

34. The appellant cannot show that she has lived in the UK for twenty years
    further to paragraph 276ADE or indeed that a the date of  the  decision
    of the Secretary of State that she was pregnant  and  thus  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to her return.

35. I see no force in the argument that the appellant  should  be  able  to
    succeed on the grounds lodged in  respect  of  a  Section  120  notice.
    Indeed the appellant made the application precisely on the basis of her
    relationship with her spouse and this ground remains the same.

36. Further to Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 00085 (IAC) I am
    not persuaded that there are any arguably good grounds to consider this
    matter outside the Immigration Rules.

37. When turning to the principles enunciated in Razgar v SSHD [2004]  UKHL
    27 I accept that she has established a  family  life  in  the  UK  with
    somebody who is a British citizen and that she is currently pregnant.

38. The threshold for establishing that her family life is engaged  is  low
    and no doubt engaged but I conclude that the  decision  to  refuse  and
    remove the appellant is in accordance with the law.  Under Section 117B
    of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 it is in the  public
    interest that people who seek to remain in the UK are not  a  financial
    burden.  The fact is that the appellant has been receiving treatment on
    the NHS during a period when she was not a student which is  the  leave
    she was given to be in the UK.  Further she has established her private
    life at a time when her immigration status was therefore precarious.  I
    can accept that the term precarious has not been defined but  she  knew
    when marrying and becoming pregnant that her stay in the  UK  was  only
    temporary and when she was a student she was expected to leave  at  the
    end of her visa.

39. Further  to  Section  117B(4)  little  weight  should  be  given  to  a
    relationship  established  when  the  appellant  was  in  the   country
    unlawfully.  The appellant clearly stated that she had stopped studying
    in 2012 and as I state thus she was not in the UK  complying  with  the
    conditions of her visa although she entered the UK  legally  and  there
    has been no curtailment. The appellant stated that she finished being a
    student when she met her husband which was in August 2012.  She was  in
    fact in the UK on the basis of being a student and it appears that this
    was not the case.  I note that the appellant states that she  would  be
    seeking work once her status was  regularised  and  that  she  and  her
    husband had supported themselves without recourse to public funds.

40. Mr Rana's submission effectively  was  that  the  appellant  could  now
    comply with the Immigration Rules but there was  no  specific  evidence
    submitted to satisfy even an updated application and it  is  not  clear
    that the appellant can fulfil the immigration rules. This is not a case
    as in  Chikwamba v SSHD  [2008] UKHL 40  where there was  a  suspension
    of forced returns to Zimbabwe.  Nor can it be said that births  do  not
    happen on a regular basis in India or that the appellant will not  have
    the support of her family. It may not  be  reasonable  to  require  the
    removal of a British citizen from the European Union but this is to  be
    distinguished from the position whereby an  independent  adult,  as  in
    this case, can make an informed decision as to where to  establish  his
    family life, Izuazu (Article 8 - New Rules) [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC) The
    sponsor in this case himself is Indian and used  to  the  language  and
    culture.

41. I am  not  persuaded  that  this  decision  is  disproportionate.   The
    appellant has her parents and brother in India and can return there and
    make an application to join her husband if that is what she  wishes  to
    do.  As the medical records indicated pregnancy is  a  natural  process
    and I have taken into account the fact that she is considered to be  at
    risk.   On  13th  August  2014  the  Barking,  Havering  and  Redbridge
    University Hospitals had undertaken numerous tests but as the appellant
    had indicated she did not appear to have  any  particular  difficulties
    with  the  pregnancy  despite  the  fact  that  she  had  had  previous
    miscarriages.

42. Overall I was not persuaded that the appellant's family life  would  be
    seriously prejudiced should she be expected to return to India to  make
    an application.  I do indeed consider that the balance to  be  accorded
    to the Secretary of State's position outweighs that of the prejudice to
    the appellant.

43. I therefore remake the decision of Judge Oakley and dismiss the  appeal
    both on the Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.
