                             DECISION AND ORDER

 1. The Secretary of State, the respondent below, appeals  with  permission
    against  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision.   By   an   exchange   of
    correspondence today, both parties agreed that there was  an  error  of
    law in the decision and applied for the appeal to be  remitted  to  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

 2. On behalf of the Upper Tribunal I concur and I  so  order.  The  appeal
    will be heard afresh in the First-tier Tribunal  with  no  findings  of
    fact or credibility preserved.

    DECISION

 1) The making of the previous decision involved the making of an error  on
    a point of law.   I set aside the previous decision.

 2) The appeal will be  reheard  afresh  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and
    further directions for that rehearing will be  given  by  the  relevant
    Tribunal.
