Officer
For the Respondent:    Ms Butler, Counsel instructed by Islington Law
Centre


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The Respondent is a national of Afghanistan date of  birth  1st  August
    1993. On the 2nd December 2017 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Povey)
    allowed, on protection and human rights grounds, his appeal  against  a
    decision to deport him from the United Kingdom. The First-tier Tribunal
    accepted, inter alia, that Mr [A] is  a  committed  Christian  who  had
    rebutted the presumption that as a 'serious criminal' he  continues  to
    pose a danger to the  community.    The  Secretary  of  State  now  has
    permission to appeal against the First-tier Tribunal decision.


 2. The primary ground of appeal is that the First-tier Tribunal's findings
    on Mr [A]'s Christian beliefs are flawed for:

           a) A failure to apply the Dorodian[1] guidelines; and
           b) A failure to give reasons; and
           c) A failure to take into account the Devaseelan findings of  an
              earlier Tribunal; and/or
           d) Irrationality


 3. The second, related, ground of appeal is that the findings on s72  must
    also be irrational, predicated as they are on the finding that  Mr  [A]
    is now a committed Christian.  Before me Mr Bates  accepted  that  this
    ground stands and falls with the first.




    Discussion and Findings


 4. The Home Office Presenting Officer at the hearing before the First-tier
    Tribunal expressly accepted that Mr [A]  would  face  a  real  risk  of
    serious harm in Afghanistan if he were  in  fact  a  genuine  Christian
    [�7.2]. That is  because  Mr  [A]  was  previously  a  Muslim  and  his
    conversion to a different faith would be classed as apostasy,  a  crime
    punishable  by  death  according  to  the  operative  Islamic  law   in
    Afghanistan.   The question before the Tribunal was  therefore  one  of
    simple fact. Had Mr [A] converted as he claimed?


 5. The First-tier Tribunal sets out its reasoning at paragraphs  27-31  of
    its determination. The Tribunal records the reasons why  the  Secretary
    of State did not accept that this was a  genuine  conversion.  It  then
    notes that various chaplains within the prison service had come forward
    to testify to their belief that Mr [A] had truly  become  a  Christian.
    The determination records the procedural history of the appeal, stating
    that the case had been adjourned on several occasions whilst  enquiries
    were made as to  whether  any  or  all  of  these  chaplains  would  be
    permitted by their employer - the Home Office - to come  to  court  and
    testify on Mr [A]'s behalf. Ultimately, none were permitted to  do  so.
    The Tribunal directed itself to the guidance in Dorodian but found that
    the expectation that an ordained minister attend court was not in  this
    case applicable: "the chaplains' non-attendance before the Tribunal has
    a very plausible and reasonable explanation, which does  not  adversely
    reflect on the Appellant" [�28].  The Tribunal was prepared  to  attach
    weight to the written evidence of the chaplains, even in their physical
    absence from court. The determination goes on [�30]:


         "I also found the Appellant's own evidence regarding  his  path  to
         Christianity consistent, cogent and  plausible.  His  imprisonment,
         becoming a father and the risk  of  deportation  were  all  factors
         which led him, whilst in prison, to explore Christianity. Since his
         release from detention he has  been  attending  his  local  Baptist
         church. Whilst the timing does appear convenient (linked as  it  is
         to the deportation proceedings) that does not sufficiently  explain
         either the Appellant's own evidence or the  opinion  of  those  who
         have had first-hand experience  of  his  faith.  If  anything,  his
         failure to raise his faith in December  2014  in  response  to  the
         intention  to  deport  serves  to  bolster,   not   diminish,   the
         Appellant's credibility. If, as claimed, his  conversion  was  mere
         convenience to avoid deportation, why not deploy it at the earliest
         opportunity? In the alternative the Appellant  could  have  claimed
         that  his  interest  in  Christianity  post-dated  the  notice   of
         intention to deport.  He  resisted  that  temptation  and  remained
         consistent regarding the reasons for and timing of  his  developing
         faith".


    The Tribunal thereby accepted that Mr [A] was a genuine Christian,  and
    in light of the HOPO's concession, allowed  the  appeal  on  protection
    grounds.




    Dorodian


 6. The Secretary of State submits that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  clearly
    failed  to  apply  the  Dorodian  guidelines.   Even  if  there  was  a
    reasonable explanation as to why the prison chaplains had  been  unable
    to testify, Mr [A] had claimed to have continued to attend church since
    he left prison. The Tribunal had overlooked the obvious point  that  he
    could have called clergy from that church to attend court.


 7. In this case Mr [A] had asserted that he had been attending services on
    a regular basis whilst in  prison;  he  claimed  to  have  undergone  a
    ceremony of baptism whilst in HMP Maidstone.  That this was so does not
    appear to have been contested. The First-tier Tribunal  had  before  it
    the certificate of baptism issued by the Reverend Alison Francis at the
    Church of the Good Shepherd in HMP Maidstone (6th April 2016), a letter
    from prison chaplain David Blackman  (19th July 2016)  confirming  that
    the Appellant had been attending  services  and  study  sessions  on  a
    regular basis,  and a series of 'prisoner  movement'  slips  indicating
    that Mr [A] had been permitted to regularly leave  the  'brickshop'  in
    order to attend church and bible study groups. This evidence appears in
    Mr [A]'s trial bundle which was lodged in accordance  with  directions.
    None of this evidence was challenged by the HOPO, nor, as far as I have
    been made aware, was any issue taken with its service.  That is perhaps
    unsurprising given that the witnesses in question are employees of  the
    Secretary of State's own department.


 8. Ms Butler submitted the Secretary of State was now seeking  to  take  a
    point that he had not taken before the First-tier  Tribunal.  Counsel's
    note recorded that the HOPO on the day had expressly accepted that  the
    prison-service chaplains could not attend, and had  agreed  that  there
    was little point in calling the minister from  the  Baptist  Church  in
    Stockport, since he had, by the date of hearing, only known Mr [A]  for
    11 days: he had been released from prison on  the  31st  October  2017,
    attended the church for the first time on the 5th  November  2017,  the
    letter had been written on the 15th and  the  appeal  hearing  was  the
    following day.

 9. I have had regard to the Record of Proceedings, and to the letter  from
    Revd. Stephen Hough of the Stockport Baptist Church.    I  accept  that
    the chronology was as Ms Butler submits.    The Secretary of State  had
    expressly accepted that none  of  the  prison  chaplains  could  attend
    court, since their terms of employment prevented them  from  so  doing.
    There was therefore no arguable error in the Judge's finding  that  the
    Dorodian guidelines did not apply to them. So too was  it  agreed  that
    the minister from Stockport could add very little, he having had such a
    short acquaintance with the Appellant.

10. I would add that the point of Dorodian witnesses is to  confirm  church
    attendance, and that where such attendance is accepted, there can be no
    error in a  judge  accepting  written  evidence  in  lieu  of  physical
    attendance of the clergy at court.   When Upper Tribunal Judge  Freeman
    gave his instructions on matters of evidence in  Christian  conversions
    cases the matter in issue was not  whether  Mr  Dorodian  had  actually
    accepted Jesus Christ to be the son of God, but whether, as he claimed,
    he had been regularly worshipping at churches in this country. This was
    important because at that time it was the  Home  Office  position  that
    Christians who worshipped in private, at home, would not be at risk  in
    Iran.  Judge Freeman said this:


         a) no-one should be regarded as a committed Christian who is not
         vouched for as such by a minister of some church established in
         this country: as we have said, it is church membership, rather than
         mere belief, which may lead to risk;

         b) no adjudicator should again be put in the position faced by Mr
         Poole in this case: a statement or letter, giving the full
         designation of the minister, should be sent to the Home Office at
         least a fortnight before the hearing of any appeal, which should
         give them time for at least a basic check on his existence and
         standing;

         c) unless the Home Office have accepted the appellant as a
         committed church member in writing in advance of the hearing, the
         minister should invariably be called to give oral evidence before
         the adjudicator: while witness summonses are available,
         adjudicators may reasonably expect willingness to do so in a
         genuine case;

         d) if any doubt remains, there is no objection to adjudicators
         themselves testing the religious knowledge of the appellant:
         judicial notice may be taken of the main beliefs and prayers of the
         Church.

11. Since in this case it was agreed that Mr [A] had been attending  church
    regularly and indeed had been baptised, there was no need  for  any  of
    the ministers involved to attend the hearing in order  to  confirm  the
    same.    Furthermore the HOPO on the day had accepted that the Dorodian
    guidelines were not applicable in this case.   I am satisfied that this
    limb of the Secretary of State's challenge is not made out.




    Reasons and rationality


12. For reasons that will become clear the remaining limbs of the challenge
    are best considered together.


13. I am not satisfied that there can be any  irrationality  in  the  Judge
    accepting that evidence that is "consistent, cogent and  plausible"  is
    sufficient to discharge the burden of  proof,  particularly  where  the
    lower standard of 'reasonable likelihood' applies, as it does  in  this
    case. Before me Mr Bates accepted that he  could  not  argue  with  the
    finding that Mr [A]'s evidence had been consistent. Nor  was  he  in  a
    position to say that it was implausible, or that it was  anything  less
    than  cogent.   The  Secretary  of   State's   real   complaint,   upon
    consideration,  is that in reaching the findings that it did the First-
    tier  Tribunal  failed  to  weigh  in  the  balance  relevant  factors,
    including the fact that Mr [A] had had an appeal dismissed in the past,
    the fact that he had committed what was a terrible crime and that there
    was an obvious litigation advantage in him claiming to  have  converted
    to Christianity.  In respect of that last  matter  Mr  Bates  suggested
    that the more obvious choice for Mr [A], if he needed spiritual solace,
    was in the faith of his birth, parents and country, namely Islam.

14. I have given careful consideration to the submissions made on behalf of
    the Secretary of State.

15. First, I am unable to say that the First-tier Tribunal  overlooked  the
    fact that Mr [A] had had an earlier appeal dismissed:  that  matter  is
    expressly recorded at paragraph 20 of its determination. As  Ms  Butler
    rightly submits, the Devaseelan principles had little or no application
    here. No part of that earlier determination, promulgated in  May  2013,
    was concerned with Mr [A]'s spirituality  or  religious  beliefs.  Nor,
    contrary to the suggestion in  the  grounds,  did  that  Tribunal  make
    markedly adverse credibility findings about  Mr  [A]  such  that  might
    arguably be relevant today. The case then put  was  that  Mr  [A]  fled
    Afghanistan as a 14 year-old because his family  were  afraid  that  he
    would be harmed in a blood feud.  The Judge (Judge McIntosh) found  [at
    his 44] that although there  were  some  discrepancies  the  "principal
    basis of the appellant's claim  had  remained  consistent  throughout".
    The claim was ultimately dismissed for want of evidence that there  was
    an actual blood feud (as opposed to an account that Mr [A]  had,  as  a
    child, been given by his family).    Even if Judge Povey had  had  more
    detailed regard to Judge McIntosh's decision, I am not  satisfied  that
    they would have had any material impact on his findings.

16. Second, it cannot be said that the Tribunal overlooked the fact that Mr
    [A] is a serious criminal. That was the point of the hearing. Reference
    is made to the criminality   or the sentence at paragraphs  3,  7,  10,
    13, 21, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 34, 35, and  36.  Whilst  it  might  be
    argued that the nature of the crime - an isolated but extremely serious
    assault on another man - would militate against a finding that  Mr  [A]
    is a Christian this too is of very limited weight given the  Tribunal's
    express  acceptance  that  it  was  the  fact  of  his  conviction  and
    imprisonment that led him to God in the first place.

17. Third, the Secretary of State contends  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    failed to consider that Mr [A] might be lying: there was  an  advantage
    to him in pretending to be a Christian, and if he really wanted to turn
    to God the most obvious path for him was  Islam.  Whilst  those  points
    would befit a Presenting Officer in the First-tier Tribunal, they  have
    considerably less merit here.  It is not an error of law to  believe  a
    witness. Nor is there any support for the contention  that  the  First-
    tier Tribunal overlooked the point of the  entire  appeal  hearing:  to
    determine whether Mr [A] was telling the truth.

18. Having read the determination as a whole I cannot be satisfied that the
    Tribunal failed to give reasons for  its  finding  that  Mr  [A]  is  a
    Christian, that it overlooked  material  facts  or  that  it  otherwise
    reached an irrational conclusion.  What it did was reach  a  conclusion
    contrary to that reached by the Secretary of  State.  That  is  not  an
    error of law.


    Decisions and Directions


19. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not contain  an  error  of
    law and it is upheld.


20. There is no order for anonymity.
