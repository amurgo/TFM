For the Respondent:    Mrs Pettersen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant is [DM], who claims to be a citizen of Iran, was born  on
    [ ] 1993.  He  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Hillis)
    against a decision of the respondent dated 8 August 2016  refusing  him
    asylum.  The First-tier Tribunal,  in  a  decision  which  is  dated  8
    February 2017, dismissed the appeal.  The appellant now  appeals,  with
    permission, to the Upper Tribunal.

 2. The parties agree that the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    vitiated by error of law.  The judge found that the appellant's conduct
    had engaged Section 8 of the 2004 Act  "and  that  his  credibility  is
    damaged as a result."  The judge goes on [24] to "remind [himself] that
    [Section 8] is only one factor to be weighed  in  the  balance  of  the
    evidence taken as a whole" it is apparent from  his  analysis  that  it
    assumed a paramount position in his reasoning.  At [25], [28] and  [34]
    when considering the appellant's account of past events and his reasons
    for claiming asylum the judge has rejected out of hand the  appellant's
    evidence on the basis that the appellant "cannot be given  the  benefit
    of the doubt in respect of any evidence he relies  on  that  cannot  be
    verified by the respondent."

 3. Whilst the judge was entitled to take into account Section  8  conduct,
    he should not have allowed it to distort and dictate what  should  have
    been findings  based  on  the  totality  of  the  evidence.   Both  the
    appellant and the respondent agree that the decision  cannot  stand  in
    consequence.

 4. Since the error of the judge goes to the very matter of the appellant's
    credibility,  there  will  need  to  be  a  new  thorough  fact-finding
    exercise.  That exercise  is  better  carried  out  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal to which this appeal is now returned.

Notice of Decision

 5. The decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  which  is  rather  dated  8
    February 2017, is set aside.  None of the findings of fact shall stand.
     The appeal is returned to the First-tier Tribunal (not  Judge  Hillis)
    for that Tribunal to remake the decision.

 6. No anonymity direction is made.
