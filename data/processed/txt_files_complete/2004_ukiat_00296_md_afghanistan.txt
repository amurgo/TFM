                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is a Home Office appeal from a decision  of  an  adjudicator  (Ms  A
   Dhanji), sitting at Hatton Cross on 1 July 2003, allowing an  asylum  and
   human rights appeal by a citizen of Afghanistan. Permission to appeal was
   given  on  the  basis  of  grounds  which  challenged  (at  ��  3-6)  the
   adjudicator's conclusion that it would be 'unduly harsh'  to  expect  the
   claimant, a Pashtun,  (or,  in  English  usage,  Pathan)  from  Samondgam
   province in northern Afghanistan, to return to Kabul. He claimed to  fear
   the forces, in his home area, of one Commander Mohamadi: while it was not
   suggested that this "warlord" had any particular influence in Kabul,  and
   the adjudicator accepted (at � 6.17) that Pashtuns formed the majority of
   the population in that part of the country, she went on to say this:

   Given what  the  objective  material  indicates  about  the  difficulties
   encountered  by  those  seeking  to  relocate  within   Afghanistan,   as
   summarised above, and given also the destruction, both  economically  and
   physically in Afghanistan after 23 years of war, I accept that  it  would
   be unduly harsh for the appellant to relocate  to  another  part  of  the
   country.


2. Permission was given in the following terms:

   2. The grounds  of  appeal  focus  on  the  adjudicator's  finding  that
   Pashtuns from northern Afghanistan  who  have  attempted  to  settle  in
   Pashtun villages and other areas of the country have not  been  accepted
   by the local communities. It is arguable that  the  adjudicator  was  in
   error in paragraph 6.15 of the determination when she decided  that  the
   objective material did not indicate that all Pashtuns face  persecution,
   it demonstrated that many do and,  taken  together  with  his  brother's
   history, the claimant was at particular risk.

   We have set all this out at such length  because  Mr  Jaisri  sought  to
   argue that the Home Office were precluded by the terms of the  grant  of
   permission from challenging the adjudicator's  conclusions  on  internal
   flight. As the vice-president carefully set out the claimant's  case  on
   this point at � 1 of the grant, and the Home Office's focus on it in the
   grounds in the first sentence of � 2, it could not be  clearer  that  he
   was aware that this was what the appeal was essentially about.

3. We have no doubt that "... Pashtun  villages  and  other  areas  of  the
   country ..." represented a following of the adjudicator's  mis-type  for
   "in other areas ..." at � 6.9 of her decision, where she is specifically
   reviewing the evidence  on  the  internal  flight  alternative.  At  all
   events, the  Home  Office  grounds  of  appeal  did  not  challenge  the
   adjudicator's findings on the claimant's  (or  his  brother's)  personal
   history in his home  area,  but  dealt  almost  entirely  with  internal
   flight; and this issue was bound to be at the  forefront  of  the  case,
   when all returns are to Kabul. We regard it as quite unarguable that the
   vice-president meant to exclude it from his grant of permission, or that
   the terms in which he gave it in fact did so.

4. The next hurdle the Home Office have to clear is CA  [2004]  EWCA  1165,
   which makes it clear that, contrary to what some people had thought, the
   requirement in the present (2002) Act for there to be a point of  law[1]
   involved for an  appeal  to  be  allowed  is  not  merely  a  threshhold
   requirement at the permission stage, but a substantive one, relating  to
   the decision at hearing. The definition of such  a  point  has  recently
   been somewhat extended in E & R [2003] EWCA Civ 49.

5. The possible point of law on the challenge to the adjudicator's internal
   flight findings in this case are two:

        a) the adjudicator did  not  specifically  consider  the  "internal
           flight alternative" to Kabul, the point of any forced return  to
           Afghanistan from this country; and

        b) she did not follow the  general  approach  of  the  Tribunal  to
           questions of internal flight to Afghanistan.

   In our view it is pointless to consider the internal flight  alternative
   in this case of   someone  presently  outside  his  country  of  origin,
   without taking a view on whether he would be at real risk at  the  point
   to return to it. If yes, then a claimant's appeal falls  to  be  allowed
   with no more ado; if no, then one goes on to consider whether  it  would
   be unduly harsh, in terms of Robinson [1997] Imm AR 568 as explained  in
   AE & FE [2003] EWCA Civ 1032, for him to have to return either there, or
   anywhere else in the country where he would be at no real risk. If  this
   is  right,  it  is  not  necessary  for  us  to  consider  the   general
   jurisprudence of the Tribunal on internal flight to Afghanistan; nor how
   far failure to follow it might raise a point of law.

6. Mr Jaisri tried to persuade us that the adjudicator had found at �  6.17
   that it would either be really risky, or unduly harsh for  the  claimant
   to have to return to Kabul. As Miss  Brown  pointed  out,  there  is  no
   finding by the adjudicator,  or  evidence  before  us,  that  "Commander
   Mohamadi" has  any  power  or  influence  in  Kabul;  and  there  is  no
   considerable evidence (at � 6.290-4 of the CIPU for  April  2004)  about
   the return and rehousing  of large numbers of refugees  from  abroad  to
   the capital. It follows that the  adjudicator's  decision  can  only  be
   justified on the basis of the material she deals  with  at  �  6.9  (and
   somewhat  elliptically  refers  back  to   at   �6.17)   about   general
   difficulties of Pashtuns from northern Afghanistan in trying to resettle
   elsewhere.

7. This was equally what Mr Jaisri relied on  in  seeking  to  support  the
   adjudicator's decision. There was a Danish government report before her,
   which was not before us, because neither side had filed or served it  in
   accordance with the standard directions. We should have preferred to see
   it, in case it went beyond what the adjudicator says  about  this  at  �
   6.9, which might have helped Mr Jaisri; and Miss Brown  was  willing  to
   provide us and him with photocopies of the one she had.

8. Mr Jaisri however resolutely objected to  that  being  done,  and  cited
   Tribunal Practice Direction no.4 in support of  his  position.  Whatever
   his motives for that,  and  whether  or  not  it  was  to  his  client's
   advantage (of which he had to be the best judge), he was entitled in our
   view to insist on that objection, and he had to confine ourselves to the
   adjudicator's summary of the report, the relevant part of which follows:

   UNHCR Kabul have, however advised that the availability of the  personal
   and social networks is vital for a person's ability to live  I  a  given
   area. The Danish Report says that  the  support  of  the  government  is
   required for the settlement of an ethnic group in another area and notes
   that the crucial issue in connection  with  resettlement  is  access  to
   resources. UNHCR Kabul  is  stated  to  have  said  that  Pashtuns  from
   northern Afghanistan who have attempted in Pashtun  villages  and  other
   areas of the country have not been accepted by the local communities.

9. Mr Jaisri sought to argue that the fact  that  these  comments  emanated
   from UNHCR's Kabul office meant that they must apply  to  the  city.  No
   doubt that office is responsible for all that part of  Afghanistan;  but
   in any case, we see nothing in the passage quoted, with  its  references
   to "villages", and "local communities" to show that  it  could  possibly
   have referred to the capital, no  doubt  more  cosmopolitan  (in  Afghan
   terms) than before since the influx of returning


   refugees referred to by Miss Brown. In our view there is nothing to show
   that there was any material before the adjudicator, and there is nothing
   further before us, to show that this claimant was  either  at  any  real
   risk to return to Kabul, or that it would be unduly harsh to expect  him
   to go there.
