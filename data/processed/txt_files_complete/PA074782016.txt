                      ERROR OF LAW FINDING AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a decision of First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
        EEM Smith  promulgated  on  9  January  2017  in  which  the  Judge
        dismissed the appellant's  appeal  on  both  protection  and  human
        rights grounds.



Background


     2. The appellant is a citizen of Ethiopia born on 1 January 1995.
     3. At [21] the Judge describes the appellant as being very  unhelpful,
        a poor historian, a witness who was prepared at the very  least  to
        exaggerate his story and who became confused as to which account he
        relied  upon.  When  challenged  by  the  Presenting  Officer,  the
        appellant is said  to  have  given  contradictory  answers  to  his
        earlier accounts.
     4. The core of the appellant's claim was considered by  the  Judge  in
        two  sections,  the  first  dealing  with  events  prior   to   the
        appellant's arrival in the United Kingdom and  the  second  section
        dealing with sur place activities.
     5. In relation to the first element the Judge finds  at  [22]  of  the
        decision under challenge:


             22. I will deal with events prior to his arrival in the UK:


   a) The appellant claims that his father joined  Ginbot  7  in  2000  (SEF
      q18). When giving evidence, he said that his father joined  after  his
      land had been taken. It was pointed out to him that what he  had  said
      in the SEF interview was that the land had been  taken  in  2008  (SEF
      q50) and not 2000. It was pointed out that in his first statement  (RB
      C1) he did not correct this error. When challenged, he maintained  the
      account he gave in evidence was true which is that the land was  taken
      in 2008 and he was therefore in error in his evidence.


   b) The appellant claims in his SEF interview  that  his  mother  received
      (SEF q55) paperwork when the land was taken; yet in his statement  (RB
      C1) he states that he did not give that answer. In  his  evidence  the
      appellant confirmed his latest account which is that she was  verbally
      informed, however, when challenged further as to  the  difference  the
      appellant reverted to his SEF account that  his  mother  was  given  a
      piece of paper.


   c) The appellant states he was arrested in Libya and detained for a year.
      He claims to have been released when his uncle paid  $2000.  He  could
      not explain how the money was transferred but it was received  by  the
      agent. This event was a year after his detention during which time  he
      asks the court to believe that the agent  waited  for  a  year  before
      seeking money to affect his release. He was asked how he got in  touch
      with his uncle and in evidence to me he said  that  he  spoke  to  his
      mother who did. It was put to him that in his SEF interview (q279)  he
      said "I know his telephone number so I made a call to him I  told  him
      arrested me, going to kill me unless I pay this amount on  money".  He
      was asked to confirm what whether what he spoke to his  mother  as  he
      had just said or his uncle as he has said in the SEF interview.  After
      a degree of hesitation, the appellant reverted to saying that he spoke
      to his uncle and, therefore, his earlier account to me was wrong.


     6. At [23] the Judge sets out his overall impression  of  findings  in
        relation to this first aspect of the case in the following terms:




             23.  These are fundamental changes  in  the  account  he  gave
                  during his SEF  interview  and  it  was  clear  that  when
                  challenged he became confused as to what he should say and
                  appeared  to  select  any  particular   answer   even   if
                  contradictory to the other answer he had provided. At  the
                  very least the appellant  in  regard  to  his  account  of
                  events before he arrived in the UK is  unreliable  and  at
                  worst untruthful.


     7. In relation to the second element of the case,  risk  arising  from
        sur place activities in the United Kingdom, the Judge writes:


             24. In relation to his Sur Place  activities  in  the  UK  the
             following is relevant:


   a) the  appellant  produced  in  evidence  the  three  originals  of  the
      photographs (AB q53).  In evidence in chief he said  that  the  middle
      and right hand photographs were taken at a  demonstration  in  London.
      The photograph on the left was taken at a demonstration in Manchester.
      In London, some 40 - 50 people took part and it took part in  Victoria
      near to the English Parliament in May 2016. Initially,  the  appellant
      said that the two photographs were taken at  two  separate  events  in
      London but then changed his account having seen  the  photographs  and
      said it was the same event. The appellant  confirmed  he  was  in  the
      middle of both photographs in the black T shirt. In cross-examination,
      the appellant was specifically  asked  if  he  had  arranged  for  the
      photographs to be taken. He replied "No, it was being taken by them  -
      the people on the demonstration". The appellant was asked how  he  got
      these photographs and he replied they had been sent to  him  after  he
      had asked for them. He was asked how the authorities  would  know  the
      contents of the photographs with him on them. He  replied  they  would
      because they are all over the place. When again challenged  about  his
      account of how the photographs had been taken with him central in each
      one the appellant gave another and a very different account.  He  said
      that the photographs were taken on his own  mobile  telephone  and  he
      asked someone to take them. He did not know the name of the person  he
      asked. He accepted that he possessed the originals.


   b) The appellant was asked  what  building  in  London  he  was  standing
      opposite. He did not know. He  was  asked  if  it  was  the  Ethiopian
      Embassy and again he did not know. In fact, it appears  the  appellant
      knew very little about this demonstration, where it took place and the
      relevance of the place he was standing or indeed why he was there.


   c) The appellant produced to the  court  a  leaflet  for  a  meeting  (as
      opposed to a demonstration) in London on 27 November 2016,  which  was
      on a different date to the demonstration. He said he attended  and  it
      was an anti-government meeting. It was put to him that the cost of the
      ticket was �25. He said he  paid  that.  He  was  asked  how  much  he
      receives each week and he confirmed it was about �37. It  was  put  to
      him that the cost of the ticket and the cost of travel  to  London  is
      greater than a week's income and it makes no sense to spend that much,
      even if he had the money. The  appellant  was  unable  to  answer.  Mr
      Howard later argued that  in  fact  if  he  did  pay  that  amount  it
      supported his claim to be committed to anti-government demonstrations.


   d) The appellant accepted that in his time in the UK this  was  the  only
      other meeting he had attended. It was put to him that the  photographs
      he had taken on his own mobile could never fall into the hands of  the
      Ethiopian authorities as they were his  own  personal  possession.  He
      didn't accept that but was unable to elaborate.


     8. The Judge sums up his overall impression in relation to the  second
        element of the case and relevant  findings  at  [26]  where  it  is
        written:


                  26.  When challenged about the different accounts  he  had
                      provided the appellant  frequently  hesitated  before
                      answering. I have assessed [sic] very carefully  this
                      appellant's   evidence,   I   have   considered   his
                      statements and in particular his claims to Sur  Place
                      activities and I have factored into my assessment his
                      section 8 failure. Having done  so  for  the  reasons
                      which I have given, I am not satisfied  even  to  the
                      lower  standard  of  proof  that  the  appellant  has
                      provided  a  true  account  of  his  experiences  and
                      reasons for claiming asylum that justifies his  claim
                      of fear. I have found  that  appellant's  account  is
                      simply not credible and he has concocted his  account
                      of the events in Ethiopia  and  in  the  UK  and  his
                      reasons  for  fearing  return.  I  am  satisfied  the
                      appellant has not established even to the lower level
                      that his father was a member of Ginbot 7 or  that  he
                      the  appellant  was.  I  am  satisfied  he  has   not
                      established his land was taken  from  his  family  or
                      that he was detained for 3 months in Ethiopia or  the
                      year in Libya.  Over  and  above  my  findings  I  am
                      satisfied those matters raised in the refusal  letter
                      in terms of credibility are  justified  and  I  adopt
                      them.


     9. The appellant sought  permission  to  appeal  asserting  the  Judge
        failed to make  findings  and  failed  to  apply  relevant  country
        guidance, made a material misdirection of fact/law, gave inadequate
        reasons as to why the appellant would not face a  persecutory  risk
        on return to Ethiopian, and failed to assess the  persecutory  risk
        of the appellant as a failed asylum seeker.
    10. Permission was initially refused  by  a  judge  of  the  First-tier
        Tribunal but granted on a renewed application by the Upper Tribunal
        of 5 May 2017.



Error of law


    11. The Judge clearly considered the evidence made available  with  the
        required  degree  of  anxious  scrutiny,  identify  relevant  legal
        issues, sets out a correct self-direction as to the  relevant  law,
        and sets out those findings  which  are  said  to  arise  from  the
        evidence made available.
    12. The alleged misdirection was a failure by the Judge  to  take  into
        account an error that occurred between the Ethiopian  calendar  and
        Gregorian calendar but such a claim has not been made  out  and  as
        pleaded fails to establish  any  arguable  error  material  to  the
        decision to dismiss the appeal arising from this point. Indeed,  in
        the grant of permission Upper Tribunal Judge  Perkins  opines  that
        there is little justification for the  contention  that  the  Judge
        perversely ignored the difference between the two calendars.
    13. The appellant  asserts  the  Judge,  whilst  noting  the  appellant
        produced evidence of participation in sur place activities,  failed
        to make a finding as to whether the appellant was actually involved
        in such activities and if so why involvement would not put  him  at
        risk on return to Ethiopia.
    14. The Judge clearly considered the evidence surrounding  this  second
        aspect of the case including noting that the appellant had arranged
        photographs of and for himself on his telephone, standing  opposite
        a building he could not identify and could not  establish  was  the
        Ethiopian Embassy, produced a leaflet for an event that it appeared
        uneconomic for the appellant to attend  with  no  evidence  of  his
        actual having attended, and that there was no evidence the material
        on the telephone will be known to or discovered  by  the  Ethiopian
        authorities.
    15. The Judge at [25]  sets  out  the  self-direction  in  relation  to
        assessing sur place activities resulting in  the  finding  at  [26]
        that  the  appellant  has  not  provided  a  true  account  of  his
        experiences and reasons for claiming asylum. The appellant's  claim
        related to risk arising from events in Ethiopia and in  the  United
        Kingdom. If the appellant had not proved what he said occurred  was
        true, this is clearly a finding by the Judge that the appellant had
        not undertaken the sur place activities he claimed that would  lead
        to a real risk on return. In this respect two points are noted, the
        first that the appellant did  not  know  if  the  building  he  was
        allegedly standing in  front  of  was  the  Ethiopian  Embassy  and
        secondly the claim that he attended a demonstration  in  London  in
        Victoria near the English Parliament in  May  2016.  The  Ethiopian
        embassy is not located in Victoria or near the  English  Parliament
        but overlooking Hyde Park in Kensington Road, South Kensington,  in
        London.
    16. The overall conclusion that the appellant  had  not  established  a
        risk arising from his sur place activities was clearly  within  the
        range of findings reasonably open to the  Judge  on  the  evidence,
        especially as the appellant  failed  to  establish  that  those  he
        claims to be in fear of would even know he was acting  as  claimed,
        irrespective of his disingenuous motive. It was found the appellant
        had failed to establish that  any  of  the  evidence  that  he  was
        seeking to rely upon would come to  the  notice  of  the  Ethiopian
        authorities.
    17. The grounds also assert the Judge failed to give  adequate  reasons
        as to why the appellant would not be at persecutory risk on  return
        to Ethiopia but such claim has no arguable merit.  The  Judge  gave
        numerous reasons why the appellant had not  established  there  was
        any merit in his claim, which was found  to  lack  credibility,  or
        that any weight could be given to the claim the appellant would  be
        perceived to be active or influential  in  opposing  the  Ethiopian
        state by the Ethiopian authorities.
    18.  The  appellant  also  asserts  the  Judge  failed  to  assess  the
        persecutory risk the appellant faces on return to  Ethiopian  as  a
        failed asylum seeker but no evidence  was  provided  by  way  of  a
        country guidance decision or country material before the First-tier
        Tribunal or Upper Tribunal to establish that a failed asylum seeker
        would be at risk for that  reason  alone  on  return  to  Ethiopia.
        Whilst there is country information showing those perceived to have
        an adverse profile may be at risk as does not extend to  those  who
        have done as  little  as  this  appellant  has,  on  the  available
        evidence.
    19. No arguable legal error has been made out. The Judge gave  adequate
        reasons for the findings made.  The  weight  to  be  given  to  the
        evidence was a matter for the Judge.


Decision

    20. There is no material  error  of  law  in  the  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge's decision. The determination shall stand.


   Anonymity


    21. The First-tier Tribunal did not make  an  order  pursuant  to  rule
        45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
        2005.


        I make that order pursuant to rule 14  of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
        (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008.
