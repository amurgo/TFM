                            DECISION AND REASONS



The Appellants

 1. The Appellants are two sisters and a brother born  respectively  on  30
    September 1987, 29 June 1988 and 1 October 1990: each is a  citizen  of
    Nepal.  They are the children of the  late  Damar  Bahadur  Gurung  who
    retired from the Brigade of Gurkhas as a sergeant on 6  September  1976
    after almost sixteen years' service.  On 7 October 1999 he died in Hong
    Kong.  The Appellants are the children of his second marriage, to Madhu
    Maya, celebrated in Nepal some five years after his discharge.

 2. On 12 June 2010 the Appellants' mother arrived with leave to enter  for
    settlement issued pursuant to the Respondent's concession to the widows
    of retired Gurkhas.  She was joined in early 2011 by her youngest child
    Meena Gurung, born on 2 September 1993, who  had  leave  to  enter  for
    settlement.  The Appellants sought entry clearance  for  settlement  to
    join their mother and younger sister.

The Decision and Appeal

 3. On 6 November 2012 the  Respondent  refused  the  application  of  each
    Appellant on  a  similar  basis.   He  referred  to  the  discretionary
    arrangements for the widows of former Gurkhas set  out  in  chapter  15
    Section 2A Annex B of the Immigration Directorate  Instructions  (IDI).
    He noted the immigration history of the Appellants' mother who is their
    Sponsor and their  youngest  sister.   The  discretionary  arrangements
    referred to in the IDI did not extend to  the  adult  children  of  the
    widows of deceased Gurkhas.  Consequently the Respondent had considered
    the applications solely under paragraph 317 of the Immigration Rules.

 4. The Respondent found the Appellants had other siblings,  uncles  and  a
    maternal grandmother in Nepal.  None of the  Appellants  suffered  from
    any medical condition or disability and they lived in the  family  home
    in  Nepal.   The  Respondent  refused  the  application   because   the
    Appellants were not living alone outside the United Kingdom in the most
    exceptional  compassionate  circumstances  as  required  by   paragraph
    317(i)(f) of the Immigration Rules.

 5. The Respondent looked at the accommodation available  to  the  Sponsor.
    He noted it was a three bedroomed  property  already  occupied  by  the
    Sponsor and her youngest daughter.  He concluded the  Appellants  would
    not be adequately accommodated without recourse to public funds and  so
    refused the applications additionally under paragraph  317(iv)  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

 6. The Respondent considered the limited financial evidence upon which the
    Appellants based their claim  that  they  were  financially  wholly  or
    mainly dependent on their mother and  decided  that  the  evidence  was
    insufficient to show  that  they  were  financially  wholly  or  mainly
    dependent upon her as  required  by  paragraph  317(iii).   He  further
    considered the evidence of the Sponsor's income  and  on  the  evidence
    provided together with the amount of monthly rent  paid  concluded  the
    Appellants could not or would  not  be  maintained  adequately  without
    recourse to additional public funds as required by paragraph 317(iv)(a)
    of the Immigration Rules.

 7. Finally, he noted the Sponsor had chosen to apply for settlement in the
    United Kingdom when the Appellants were adult  and  that  all  of  them
    lived together and had other family  in  Nepal.   Family  life  between
    their mother and themselves as adult children could  satisfactorily  be
    continued by visits and in the same manner as prior to the  refusal  of
    the Appellants' applications.

 8. On 5 December 2012 each of the Appellants lodged notice of appeal under
    Section 82 of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act  2002  as
    amended (the 2002 Act).  The grounds are generic and formulaic.

The First-tier Tribunal's Determination

 9. By a determination promulgated on 9 May 2014 Judge  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Walters dismissed the  appeal  of  each  Appellant  under  the
    Immigration Rules and on human rights grounds.  At paragraph 8  of  his
    determination he referred  to  a  letter  from  money  transfer  agents
    stating that the Sponsor had sent  thirteen  separate  amounts  to  the
    Appellants between 10 November 2011 and 19 November 2011.  He  did  not
    consider such evidence satisfactory.  At paragraph 12 he expressed some
    concern about the limited evidence of the Sponsor's  earnings  and  the
    lack of evidence of any earnings by the Sponsor's youngest daughter who
    lived with her.  He went on to dismiss the appeals on all grounds.

10. The  Appellants  sought  permission  to  appeal  and  on  2  June  2014
    Designated Judge of the First-tier Tribunal Zucker  granted  permission
    to appeal on the basis it was arguable the Judge's  assessment  of  any
    family life had been overly focussed on whether  remittances  had  been
    sent by the Sponsor to the Appellants rather than  any  holistic  view.
    Further, it was arguable the Judge's explanation was too brief so  that
    it was arguable that it was inadequately reasoned.

The July Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. Notice of the time, date  and  place  set  for  the  hearing  had  been
    properly given to each of the Appellants  and  their  then  solicitors.
    Late on 14 July the clerk to the Counsel instructed for the  Appellants
    wrote to the Tribunal advising that the Counsel had  two  cases  to  be
    heard at Field House on 22 July, being the date set for the hearing  of
    these appeals.

12. On 16 July the Appellants' solicitors had  submitted  bundles  for  the
    Appellants and on 18 July they had written to  the  Upper  Tribunal  to
    advise they were no  longer  acting  but  nevertheless  the  Appellants
    wished to continue with their appeal.

13.  At  about  10.30am  Ms  Ward,  Counsel  instructed  by  the  erstwhile
    solicitors  for  the  Appellants,  informed  the  Tribunal   that   her
    instructing solicitors were no longer  instructed  by  the  Appellants.
    Neither the Sponsor nor anyone else had appeared for the Appellants and
    no message had been left with reception at Field  House.   Searches  of
    the public areas of Field House had not disclosed the  Sponsor  or  any
    representative, other than Ms Ward.

14. Ms Everett checked her papers and I checked mine to see if there was  a
    telephone number for the Sponsor but neither of us could find one.

15. I have considered the documents in the Tribunal  file  and  the  issues
    raised.  Having regard to the over-riding objective to deal with  cases
    fairly and justly contained in Rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper
    Tribunal) Rules 2008 as amended and being satisfied that the Appellants
    and their Sponsor had been notified of the date, time and place of  the
    hearing and that it was in the  interests  of  justice  of  proceed,  I
    decided to proceed with the hearing, at least so far as a consideration
    of whether the First-tier Tribunal's determination contained  an  error
    of law.

Error of Law Consideration

16. Ms Everett for the Respondent noted the Respondent had  not  filed  any
    response in accordance with  Rule  24  of  the  Procedure  Rules.   She
    submitted that on the evidence before him, the  Judge  had  been  fully
    entitled to reach the conclusions he  did  and  that  no  Tribunal  re-
    hearing the appeals would come to any different conclusion.

Consideration

17. I noted the Judge's determination made  no  reference  to  any  of  the
    extensive case law or Home Office policies relating  to  the  grant  of
    entry clearance for settlement to former Gurkhas, their wives and adult
    children.  There was no reference to the State's acknowledgment of  the
    historic injustice done to former Gurkhas and to their families.

18. The Judge's consideration of the Appellants' claim under Article  8  of
    the European Convention outside  the  Immigration  Rules  contained  no
    reference to any of the recent extensive jurisprudence  on  this.   The
    Judge found that family life did not exist between  the  Appellants  in
    Nepal and their mother and younger sister  in  the  United  Kingdom,  a
    finding which runs counter to the  learning  in  AG  (Eritrea)  v  SSHD
    [2007] EWCA Civ 801 in which it was held there is a low  threshold  for
    the establishment of family life.  In the light of  these  authorities,
    it was incumbent upon the Judge to proceed to a full  consideration  of
    the Appellants' claim under Article 8 following the five  step  process
    described in R (oao Razgar) v SSHD [2004] UKHL 27.  For  these  reasons
    which are referred to in the grounds for appeal to the Upper  Tribunal,
    I find the First-tier Tribunal's determination contained  an  error  of
    law such that it should be set aside and the matter heard afresh.

19. In view of the fact that the Appellants had only very  recently  ceased
    to instruct their solicitors I considered  it  would  not  be  just  to
    proceed to re-determine the appeals and arranged for them to  be  heard
    before me at Field House at 10am on Thursday 4 September 2014.

20. At about 3.15 that afternoon the Sponsor  together  with  her  youngest
    daughter, a friend of the daughter and  a  gentleman  described  as  an
    uncle arrived.  The appeal had been listed for  10am.   They  explained
    they had experienced difficulties in travelling to Field  House.   With
    the agreement of Ms Everett for the Respondent I explained to them what
    had happened in the morning and that the appeals would be re-heard on 4
    September.

The September Hearing

21. The Sponsor and the Appellant's youngest sister together with a  person
    who stated he was the Sponsor's brother-in-law attended.  Ms Wason  was
    also present as a McKenzie Friend. I explained the  procedure  I  would
    adopt as the Appellants now had a McKenzie Friend.

22. The Sponsor started to  give  oral  testimony  but  explained  she  was
    illiterate and even if someone had read to her the three  decisions  of
    the Respondent under appeal she would have soon forgotten the  details.
    It was agreed the Sponsor's daughter should give oral  testimony.   She
    confirmed that the Respondent's decisions to refuse her siblings  entry
    clearance had been explained to her.  She had four siblings of the full
    blood.  The Appellants had an older  brother  Min  Bahadur  Gurung  who
    lived in Nepal.

23. At  this  point  Mr  Bramble  commented  Ms  Wason  had  not  seen  the
    Respondent's previous decision granting entry clearance to the  witness
    and there were other  issues  which  needed  to  be  addressed.   These
    included evidence relating to the various transfers  of  money  to  the
    Appellants.  The money agents had referred to transfers made  prior  to
    the decisions under appeal but there were no further  details  of  such
    transfers and the bank statements submitted did not suggest appropriate
    withdrawals made to fund the transfers. The Sponsor's tenancy agreement
    indicated her accommodation comprised three rooms in  addition  to  the
    usual offices but there was nothing to show that the accommodation  was
    suitable for five adults.  The Appellants' father had  been  discharged
    from the army long before his marriage to their mother and this  needed
    to be considered in relation to the aspect of  the  historic  injustice
    suffered by the Gurkhas.  It was evident the Sponsor was illiterate and
    the McKenzie Friend needed to time to consider the documents  and  give
    advice in good time and not in the course of  the  hearing.   Ms  Wason
    said that given time she  might  be  able  to  secure  pro  bono  legal
    representation for the Appellants.  Following a short discussion during
    which I checked that Ms Wason had now been supplied with  the  relevant
    documents, and Mr Bramble said that he would speak outside the  hearing
    room with Ms Wason, it was agreed the hearing should be  adjourned  and
    that no further directions were required.

The November Hearing

24. The hearing was set to be resumed at Field House at  1400  hours  on  6
    November.  By 1415 hours neither the Sponsor nor her youngest  daughter
    nor any representative or McKenzie Friend had  appeared.   Searches  of
    the reception area at Field House did not disclose any of them  and  no
    message had been received at the reception desk.  I was satisfied  that
    notice of the time, date  and  place  set  for  the  hearing  had  been
    properly given to the Appellants  and  their  McKenzie  Friend  at  the
    relevant address which Ms Isherwood confirmed was the same as  that  in
    the Respondent's records and I checked was the same as had  been  given
    to the Tribunal at the September hearing.  In all the circumstances and
    in particular in the light of what had happened  at  the  two  previous
    hearings, I was satisfied it would be just to proceed with the  hearing
    in the absence of the Sponsor and any representative or McKenzie Friend
    for the Appellants.  There was no communication on  the  Tribunal  file
    from the Appellants, their Sponsor or  any  McKenzie  Friend  or  legal
    representative subsequent to the September hearing.

25. For the Respondent Ms Isherwood relied on the determination in  Ghising
    and Others (Ghurkhas/BOCs: historic  wrong;  weight)  [2013]  UKUT  567
    (IAC).  She relied in particular on paragraph 60 which states:

         Once this point is grasped, it can immediately be appreciated  that
         there may be cases  where  Appellants  in  Gurkha  cases  will  not
         succeed, even though their family life engages Article 8(1) and the
         evidence shows they would have come  to  the  United  Kingdom  with
         their father, but for the injustice that prevented the latter  from
         settling here  on  completion  of  his  military  service.  If  the
         Respondent can point to matters over and above the "public interest
         in maintaining of a firm immigration policy", which argue in favour
         of removal or the refusal of leave to enter, these  must  be  given
         appropriate weight in the balance in the Respondent's favour. Thus,
         a bad immigration history and/or criminal behaviour  may  still  be
         sufficient  to  outweigh  the  powerful  factors  bearing  on   the
         Appellant's side. Being an adult child of a UK settled  Gurkha  ex-
         serviceman is, therefore, not a "trump card", in the sense that not
         every application by such a person will inevitably succeed. But, if
         the Respondent is relying only upon the public  interest  described
         by the Court of Appeal at paragraph 41 of Gurung, then  the  weight
         to be given to the  historic  injustice  will  normally  require  a
         decision in the Appellant's favour.

    The Respondent had also noted that the Appellants had not disclosed the
    existence of their half-siblings in Nepal.

26. Ms Isherwood continued there was no evidence  before  the  Tribunal  to
    show the intention of the Appellants' father to  have  settled  in  the
    United Kingdom, had he been permitted to do so.  The Appellants had not
    supplied any statement or further documentary  evidence  to  show  they
    would be adequately maintained and accommodated.  They had  not  sought
    to explain the dates and considerably  varying  amounts  of  the  money
    transfers or the substantial gaps of time between some of them.

27. Issues which had been raised in the First-tier Tribunal's determination
    such as the lack of evidence of the youngest sister's employment at the
    date of the decision had not been addressed.  By the date of the First-
    tier Tribunal hearing the sister had a different job. The  schedule  of
    money  transfers  was  insufficient  to  establish  dependency  in  any
    meaningful sense.  The Appellants had failed to give a true picture  of
    their situation in Nepal.

28. The Appellants generally had failed to address the issues raised by the
    appeal of which they had ample and full notice.  The evidence given  by
    the Appellants at their  respective  interviews  produced  inconsistent
    replies.  Generally the Appellants had failed  to  supply  evidence  to
    address the issues in the appeal.  The burden of  proof  to  the  civil
    standard, that is the balance of probabilities, was on the  Appellants.
    There was no explanation for the failure of the Sponsor or anyone  else
    to appear for the Appellants. It was not disproportionate to  the  need
    to maintain proper immigration control to refuse entry clearance to the
    Appellants.  The appeals should therefore be dismissed.

Consideration and Findings

29. The Appellants have shown that there would  be  adequate  accommodation
    for them as evidenced by the  letter  of  2  March  2012  from  Shepway
    District Council in the Appellants' bundle.

30. The evidence is that the Appellant's first wife eloped: see the  letter
    of 13 July 2009  from  the  Records  Office  of  the  British  Gurkhas,
    Pokhara.  The letter shows the children of that marriage were  born  in
    1970, 1971, 1972 and 1974.  There  was  no  other  evidence  about  the
    children of the first marriage  of  the  Appellants'  father  or  their
    relationships, if any whether past or present, to the Appellants or the
    Sponsor and no explanation for the lack of such evidence.  The youngest
    of the children of this first marriage would have been aged about 6  or
    7 at the time of the Sponsor's  marriage  to  the  Appellants'  father.
    Such evidence might have gone some  way  to  explaining  why  when  the
    Appellants were asked at interview about their  family  in  Nepal  they
    failed to make any  mention  of  their  half-siblings.   Each  of  them
    mentioned two paternal uncles but stated they had no knowledge of their
    whereabouts.  They added that the Sponsor's mother  remains  in  Nepal.
    There is no reference in the Sponsor's statement to her mother  or  how
    she manages in Nepal.

31. In her statement the Sponsor refers at paragraphs 29 and 30 to  sending
    money to her children and confirms that recently she has  been  sending
    money on a regular basis.  The documentary evidence before the Tribunal
    includes the statement of the Sponsor's account with Lloyds TSB  ***560
    for the period 22 December  2011  to  21  March  2012.   She  has  also
    submitted a list of money transmissions to the Appellants from  Pokhara
    Travel & Money Transfer Ltd.  During the period  covered  by  the  bank
    statement she made transmissions on 2 and 24  February  and  21  March.
    None of the entries in the bank statements appear to link in any way to
    the timing of the money transmissions or the amount sent.   The  period
    covered by the bank statement ends some seven months before the date of
    the decision and the period  covered  by  the  statement  from  Pokhara
    Travel  showing  money  transmissions  runs  from  10  January  2011-19
    November 2012.  The amounts sent are usually  between  �110  and  �400.
    There was one transmission of �2,000.  There is no explanation for this
    single large transmission.  There are  thirteen  transmissions  listed,
    their frequency is erratic.  The first transmission is for  �810  which
    is the only other transmission in  excess  of  �400.   The  approximate
    periods between transmissions vary between seven months  and  one  day.
    The evidence of the Sponsor's income  is  that  it  is  received  on  a
    regular and fairly level basis.  There  was  no  explanation  for  what
    appears to be an unusual or irregular pattern of money transmissions.

32. The Appellants' evidence about their home in Nepal varied.  Two  stated
    that it was owned by the Sponsor and  one  that  it  was  rented.   Two
    stated that it had the benefit of running water,  electricity,  heating
    and television and one stated that there were problems with  the  water
    and electricity supplies.  When asked what they would do if  they  were
    refused entry clearance, two said they would re-apply and one said  she
    would continue her studies in Nepal.   There  was  no  explanation  for
    these apparent inconsistencies or variations.  It was never argued that
    the Appellants or any of them could satisfy  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules.

33. The Appellants' mother obtained settlement on the basis of a concession
    for the benefit of the widows of Gurkhas who had served in the Brigade.
     She was followed some six months later by her youngest child who was a
    minor at the time.  The Appellants' appeals are based entirely  on  the
    claim that their exclusion places the United Kingdom in breach  of  its
    obligations to respect the private and family lives of  the  Appellants
    and the Sponsor and their sister which are protected by  Article  8  of
    the European Convention.

34. Sections 117A and 117B of the 2002 Act are applicable  to  the  hearing
    afresh  of  these  appeals.   They  provide  that  the  maintenance  of
    effective immigration control is in the public interest and that it  is
    in the public interest that  persons  who  seek  to  enter  the  United
    Kingdom are able to speak English because such persons are  less  of  a
    burden on taxpayers and are better able to integrate into  society  and
    that such persons should be financially independent.

35. The evidence is that the Sponsor's income is limited.  Her  P60  of  20
    December 2013 shows total earnings of about �2,720 from three  separate
    jobs with the same  employer  and  payslips  for  a  fourth  employment
    showing gross earnings for the year 2011/12 of about �11,400.

36. The Sponsor's tenancy agreement for the year ending 30 April 2012 calls
    for payment of an exclusive calendar monthly rent of �550.   There  was
    no explanation for various entries in the bank statement  which  anyway
    does not show entries which could be related to payment of rent.  There
    was no evidence whether the youngest sister was bringing any money into
    the household.  There was no evidence the Appellants spoke English  and
    indeed their  interviews  were  conducted  in  Nepali.   There  was  no
    evidence they had any prospects of  employment  on  coming  or  shortly
    after coming to the United Kingdom.   The  evidence  to  support  their
    claimed  dependency  on  the  Sponsor  is  so  incomplete  as   to   be
    unsatisfactory.

37. The Appellants' mother came to the United Kingdom and was permitted  to
    settle in the United Kingdom by virtue of a concession made  in  favour
    of the widows of ex-Gurkhas.  Her  youngest  child  was  granted  entry
    clearance for settlement some six months later.  The  evidence  of  the
    dependency of the Appellants aged approximately 27, 24 and  21  at  the
    date of decision is sketchy.  The substantial variation in the  amounts
    sent  and  the  erratic  timing  of  the  transmissions,   absent   any
    explanation  and  there  was  none,  is  not  indicative  of  any  real
    dependency, even of a limited nature.

38. The rights protected by Article 8 of the Appellants' mother and  sister
    to a family life with the Appellants need to be considered in  addition
    to the corresponding rights of the Appellants,  having  regard  to  the
    jurisprudence in Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2008] UKHL 39.  At paragraph 42 of
    R (oao Gurung) v SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 8 the Court noted:

         ... if a Gurkha can show that, but for the historic  injustice,  he
         would have settled in the UK at a time  when  his  dependent  (now)
         adult child would have been able to accompany him  as  a  dependent
         child under the age of 18, that is strong reason for  holding  that
         it is proportionate to permit the adult child to  join  his  family
         now.

39. With this in mind, I adopt  the  approach  to  appeals  on  grounds  of
    Article 8 summarised at paragraphs 7-12 of EB (Kosovo)  v  SSHD  [2008]
    UKHL 41.  I accept the Appellants have a private and family  life  with
    their mother and their sister in the United Kingdom although there  was
    no evidence before the Tribunal about how that family life is  pursued,
    whether by letter or telephone or other means of communication.  I have
    found the Appellants' claimed dependency  on  the  Sponsor  is  at  its
    highest limited.  In these circumstances,  I  conclude  the  Appellants
    have not discharged the burden of proof to the balance of probabilities
    to  show  the  decisions  under  appeal  are   a   sufficiently   grave
    interference with the family lives of the Appellants  or  their  mother
    and sister to engage the United Kingdom's obligations under  Article  8
    of the European Convention.

40. In the alternative, if this assessment is incorrect, I note  there  was
    no suggestion that decisions had been taken other  than  in  accordance
    with the law  and  due  process.   There  would  remain  the  balancing
    exercise to assess whether the decisions to exclude  are  proportionate
    to a legitimate public objective referred to in Article 8(2).

41. In addition to all the factors already mentioned, I have the  relevance
    and impact of the historic injustice suffered by the Gurkhas.  In  each
    case it is a matter of what weight should be attached to that injustice
    when conducting the balancing exercise and that the historic  injustice
    will carry significant weight and is likely  to  outweigh  the  matters
    relied on by the Respondent where these consist solely  of  the  public
    interest in maintaining a firm immigration policy: see paragraph 59  of
    the determination in Ghising and Others.  Of course, the  determination
    in Ghising was promulgated well before the 2002 Act was amended by  the
    inclusion of Section 117 in  respect  of  which  I  have  already  made
    findings unfavourable to the Appellants.  Crucially, in this case there
    was no evidence that the Appellants' father would have settled  in  the
    United Kingdom, if he had been permitted to.

42. The whole of the Appellants' family came  into  being  long  after  the
    Appellants'  father  had  been  discharged  from   the   Brigade.   The
    Appellants' mother obtained settlement on the basis of a concession  in
    favour of widows of ex-Gurkhas.  There was a lack of evidence generally
    and,  in  particular,  a  failure  to  show  the  Appellants'  material
    dependency upon their mother and the nature of their family life.

43. I make no adverse inference from the failure of the Sponsor  or  anyone
    to appear for the Appellants or the lack of any explanation  for  their
    non-appearance.  However the consequence is that I  can  consider  only
    the evidence which is to be found in the Tribunal file.

44. Looking at the matter in  the  round,  particularly  in  the  light  of
    paragraph 60 of the determination in Ghising and Others set  out  above
    and taking into account the additional factors to be considered in  the
    assessment of the proportionality of  the  decisions  to  the  need  to
    maintain immigration control highlighted by Section 117 of the 2002 Act
    as well as what impact the historic injustice against the  Gurkhas  has
    in these particular appeals, I have come to  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellants have failed to discharge the burden of proof on them.

45. If, contrary to my earlier finding, the  United  Kingdom's  obligations
    under Article 8 of the European Convention are engaged in this  appeal,
    then taking into full account the historic injustice issue as  well  as
    the rest of the evidence, I find the Appellants have failed to show  on
    the balance of probabilities that their continued  exclusion  from  the
    United Kingdom is disproportionate to the economic  well-being  of  the
    country which includes the need to maintain proper immigration control:
    see Shahzad (Art 8: legitimate aim) [2014] UKUT 85.  Consequently  each
    of the appeals is dismissed.

Anonymity

46. There was no request for an anonymity direction and  having  heard  the
    appeal I consider there is no need for one.

DECISION
