Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms N Quadi of Counsel, instructed by Legal Justice
solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms L Kenny, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Afghanistan born on 20 May 1977.  He  is
    of Sikh religion and wears a turban.  He arrived in the  UK  unlawfully
    on 16 August 2014 and claimed asylum three days later.

 2. The basis of his claim is that he had had a shop in  Afghanistan  which
    sold cosmetics and underwear.  Acid was thrown at him in 2010  and  his
    foot was burnt.  He believes this was carried out by Muslims.   He  had
    lived in Afghanistan all his life and there was  a  further  attack  in
    2013 which  was  an  alleged  kidnapping.   He  feared  persecution  if
    returned for himself and his family. It  was  also  his  case  that  he
    suffered polio as a child which had left him with one leg shorter  than
    the other and pain in his back and legs which required treatment.

 3. The Secretary of State refused his asylum  application  in  a  decision
    dated 2 July 2018 albeit it was accepted that he is an Afghan  Sikh  as
    claimed. The Appellant appealed against this decision  and  his  appeal
    came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian for hearing on 10 August
    2018.  In a decision and reasons promulgated  on  29  August  2018  the
    judge dismissed the appeal.

 4. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was sought, in time, on  the
    basis of five grounds. Firstly, that the judge  erroneously  failed  to
    take account of  relevant  evidence  in  light  of  the  fact-sensitive
    approach  required  in  TG  and  others   (Afghan   Sikhs   persecuted)
    Afghanistan CG [2015] UKUT  00595  (IAC).   In  particular,  the  judge
    failed to consider the vulnerabilities faced by  the  Appellant's  wife
    and whether the Appellant's medical health  conditions  meant  that  he
    could be considered an adequate  protector  in  respect  of  his  wife.
    Those vulnerabilities were identified as the fact that the  Appellant's
    wife had experienced threats and  harassment  whilst  at  home  and  in
    public even with the accompaniment of the Appellant and  the  increased
    risks she felt being at home on her own since the death of her  father-
    in-law and the fact she was unable to leave the home  on  her  own  for
    safety and security reasons. It was asserted that the judge's  findings
    in respect of the Appellant's wife as a Sikh woman in  Afghanistan  are
    unclear and there was a failure to provide any or adequate  reasons  as
    to why he dismissed the appeal in this respect.

 5. It was asserted further that the judge had failed to  consider  whether
    the requirement on the Appellant's wife to wear a burka was contrary to
    the judgment of the Supreme Court in HJ Iran and Lord  Justice  Beatson
    in MSM Somalia [2016] EWCA Civ 715 at 37.  Reference was  made  to  the
    appeal currently before the Supreme Court in FA  Pakistan  and  whether
    refusal of asylum on the expectation an  individual  will  supress  the
    expression of their religious faith where the  state  criminalises  the
    reasonable  expression  of  that  identity  is  consistent   with   the
    fundamental right to live openly and freely as themselves, see HJ  Iran
    and HT Cameroon [2010] UKSC 31 or with the understanding  of  religious
    belief as "so fundamental to human identity  that  one  should  not  be
    compelled  to  hide,  change  or  renounce  this  in  order  to   avoid
    persecution": see RT Zimbabwe [2012] UKSC 38.

 6. Ground 2 asserted that the  judge  failed  to  address  the  issues  of
    sufficiency of protection and internal relocation which  was  important
    given that the home area is Kabul and this  requires  a  fact-sensitive
    approach, see: AS (Safety of Kabul) Afghanistan CG  [2018]  UKUT  00118
    (IAC).

 7. The  third  ground  of  appeal  asserted  that,  in  finding  that  the
    Appellant's son would be able to access education in Afghanistan  based
    on his findings at [37] to [41] and [76] that he is doing  so  well  he
    must have attended school  in  Afghanistan  contrary  to  the  evidence
    before him. It was submitted that this finding was entirely speculative
    and thus it was unlawful as lacking any  evidential  basis.  The  judge
    also stated at [38]:

         "The Appellant's son is not  handicapped  educationally.   I would
         have expected a letter from his school in the UK  to  set  out  the
         problems that he has if he was handicapped and if he had ever  been
         to school before he arrived in the  UK.   Quite  the  contrary  the
         reports on him are glowing reports".

 8. It was asserted to suggest that a child could only be doing well if  he
    had previously attended school is beyond the remit  of  the  Tribunal's
    expertise and  goes  beyond  the  factual  findings  and  secondly  the
    language used was wholly inappropriate.

 9. Fourthly, it was submitted that the judge adopted a flawed approach  to
    the best interests of the Appellant's children, a second  child  having
    been born who is a female  child  currently  aged  18  months.  It  was
    asserted that the judge purported to deal with the  best  interests  of
    the children at [70] to [72] but this is untenable

      a) firstly, due to a lack of rigour  in  conducting  that  assessment;



      b) secondly, in failing to have regard to or apply material aspects of
         TG CG, particularly given the younger child is a girl and  at  [94]
         in TG the Upper Tribunal found that Sikh children especially  girls
         are not sent to school "as a result of the fear of  harassment  and
         ill-treatment"; and

      c) thirdly, that the judge failed  to  provide  any  reasons  for  his
         conclusions in respect of the best interests of  the  children  and
         failed to consider the  enhanced  risks  the  Appellant's  daughter
         would face.

10. Fifthly, it was submitted that the judge had failed to give the  appeal
    anxious scrutiny, given that the decision and reasons contain  numerous
    spelling errors and was incoherent in  structure  and  layout.  It  was
    further asserted that the decision lacked clear reasons as to  why  the
    Appellant's appeal had been  dismissed,  cf.  Budhathoki  (reasons  for
    decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC).

11. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge Povey  in
    the following terms

         "It was arguable that the judge  failed  to  adequately  explain  a
         number of findings material to his conclusions.  The  determination
         as a whole contained  excessive  spelling  and  grammatical  errors
         which undermined its cogency and made aspects of  it  difficult  to
         understand.   It  was  also  arguable  that  the   best   interests
         assessment was inadequately reasoned at 70 and the judge failed  to
         consider properly or at all whether the family may  face  risks  on
         return to Kabul, per AS Safety in Kabul Afghanistan CG [2018]  UKUT
         18.  If those risks were considered the  conclusions  reached  were
         not apparent ... all grounds may be argued".

12. A Rule 24 response was lodged by the Respondent on 12 November 2018, in
    which the Respondent stated that he opposed the Appellant's appeal  and
    would submit that the Judge of the First-tier Tribunal directed himself
    appropriately, that the grounds of appeal were  simply  a  disagreement
    and the judge gave full reasons  for  rejecting  the  evidence  of  the
    Appellant's wife that she was afraid to leave the family home.  It  was
    asserted that the judge properly applied all relevant case law  to  his
    findings of fact and he was clear to say that some Afghan  Sikhs  would
    face persecution on return but not this Appellant or his family.

     Hearing

13. At the hearing before the Upper Tribunal, Ms Quadi sought  to  rely  on
    the grounds of appeal and made further submissions in that respect.   I
    indicated to both Ms Quadi and Ms Kenny for the Secretary of State that
    I considered the judge had erred in respect of his focus on  the  issue
    of the Appellant's son's education, given that he was  only  6  at  the
    time he left Afghanistan and if he had indeed gone to school at all  it
    would, therefore, have been for a very short time.  Thus I did not need
    to hear from either of them in that respect.

14. Ms Quadi submitted in summary that there  was  an  absence  of  anxious
    scrutiny and adequate reasoning.  There were no clear findings of  fact
    or material issues, particularly as relates to the Appellant's wife and
    this led to the submission and conclusion that the decision  could  not
    be accepted as fair.  Much of the  evidence  had  not  been  considered
    properly or findings made and the judge had failed to consider  whether
    the cumulative impact of the discrimination  and  likely  circumstances
    the family would encounter would meet the threshold for persecution cf.
    Article 9 of the QD.

15. In her submissions, Ms Kenny stated that the starting point in light of
    the  country  guidance  decision  in  TG  and  others   (Afghan   Sikhs
    persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015] UKUT 00595 (IAC) is that Afghan Sikhs
    can face discrimination amounting  to  persecution  but  this  is  fact
    specific.  She submitted the judge  had  considered  all  the  relevant
    factors; had considered the Appellant's past history at  [48]  and  was
    entitled to find that there were only two instances where he personally
    had problems with Muslims.

16. At [52] the judge found the Appellant and his family had  always  lived
    in Afghanistan and the Appellant's wife's situation  was  no  different
    from anyone else in Afghanistan in respect of being obliged to wear the
    burka.  She submitted that the Judge considered  the  country  guidance
    decision in TG quite thoroughly at [53] and found that in  general  the
    cumulative impact of discrimination suffered  by  the  Sikh  and  Hindu
    communities does not reach the threshold of persecution.

17. Ms Kenny submitted that the judge was entitled to find the  Appellant's
    wife is part of a stable  family  unit  and  has  the  support  of  her
    husband, that the judge had given sound reasons for  finding  that  the
    Appellant and his family do not reach the threshold  for  international
    protection.

18. Ms Kenny submitted that it was not necessary for the judge to  consider
    internal relocation in light of his findings on the credibility of  the
    first Appellant and given the finding in TG at 119(ii) that  there  was
    no real risk of persecution or ill-treatment per se.

19. In respect of the children and their best interests  the  eldest  child
    had only been in the UK for four years.  He speaks Afghani language and
    would be easily able to adapt and it  would  be  clearly  in  his  best
    interests to remain with the family unit.  In respect  of  the  younger
    child as she was only 18 months she was  very  young  and  not  yet  of
    school age. She submitted the judge did address the issue of  education
    for girls in accordance with the country guidance  decision  in  TG  at
    [94] and [95] and there were no errors of law in the  decision  of  the
    judge.

20. In reply, Ms Quadi submitted it was clear the judge  had  not  properly
    considered  risk  on  return  to  the  Appellant's  son.  The   judge's
    consideration of the fact the Appellant's wife would  have  to  wear  a
    burka is unclear and incoherent in structure, in that  he  begins  that
    consideration at [51] and [52] however then returns to it at  [57]  and
    [58].  Whilst she accepted that the judge had given some  consideration
    to TG it cannot properly be said that all the relevant factors had been
    considered, particularly given the Appellant's wife would be  a  female
    returning  to  Afghanistan,  therefore  the   effectiveness   of   male
    protection and being obliged to wear a burka in order to be  safe  from
    persecution were key material issues and that the Appellant's  youngest
    child is a girl. Ms Quadi submitted it was imperative for the judge  to
    consider what would happen on  return  in  respect  of  the  individual
    factors in the case.  The judge had failed to  actually  determine  the
    best  interests  of  the  children  and  the  manner   in   which   the
    determination had been given was convoluted, confused and unreliable.

     Findings and Reasons

21. I find material errors of law in the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Andonian essentially for the reasons set out in  the  grounds  of
    appeal.

22. Whilst the judge did have regard to the country guidance decision in TG
    and others (Afghan Sikhs persecuted) Afghanistan CG [2015]  UKUT  00595
    (IAC) I find there was an absence of clear findings of fact in relation
    to the risk on return for this family, the judge's focus being  on  the
    credibility of the first Appellant's account of the  reasons  why  they
    had fled from Afghanistan.  Even if, as the judge found,  his  evidence
    as to that was not credible,  it  was  necessary  to  provide  adequate
    reasons for his findings and there is an absence  of  such  reasons  in
    respect of material issues.

23. The judge rejected the Appellant's account that he has no  family,  his
    mother having passed away thirteen years  ago  and  his  father  having
    passed away eight years ago and that he would have nowhere to live, the
    family home being sold. At  [70]  however  the  judge  held  under  the
    heading, best interests of children

         "I have considered the situation concerning the best  interests  of
         the children and there is another child who is  1�  of  age  and  I
         believe they can be accommodated into their society in Afghanistan.
           I  do  not  believe  that  the  Appellant  has  no  relatives  in
         Afghanistan he could not turn to.  Neither do I believe he does not
         have a home.  Their evidence was not credible."

24. The difficulty with this passage is it is not possible to know why  the
    judge reached those findings, in that the findings lack clarity and are
    entirely unreasoned.

25. In relation to the best interests of the Appellant's children, there is
    no or no proper consideration of best interests at  all.   I  find  the
    manner in which the judge addressed the issue of education to be flawed
    and whilst the Appellant's daughter is not currently of school age, she
    would clearly become of school age on return to Afghanistan.  In  light
    of the judgment in TG 119(iii)(d), access to appropriate education  for
    children in light of discrimination against Sikh and Hindu children and
    the shortage of adequate education facilities for them should be  given
    careful attention when assessing the real risk of persecution.

26. I find that the judge, having reached a conclusion that the Appellant's
    evidence as to his past history was not credible, went  on  to  dismiss
    the appeal essentially  based  on  those  findings,  as  opposed  to  a
    holistic consideration of the circumstances of the Appellant's wife and
    children.

27. In respect of the Appellant's wife there is  no  consideration  of  the
    fact the Appellant suffered from polio as a child  and  the  impact  of
    that on his day-to-day functioning would have on his effectiveness as a
    protector for his wife, nor on the risk to her  on  the  basis  of  her
    gender as opposed to her religion and  whether  in  light  of  HJ  Iran
    [2010] UKSC 31, it was reasonable to expect her as a Sikh woman to have
    to wear a burka in order to avoid persecution.  On the face of it  this
    would appear to fall squarely within the category of case  which  would
    give rise to a  well-founded  fear  of  persecution  in  light  of  the
    judgments of their lordships in HJ Iran.

28. For the reasons set out above I find material  errors  of  law  in  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge. I remit  the  appeal  for  a
    hearing de novo before the First tier Tribunal.



                                 Directions

1.   A Punjabi interpreter is required (Afghani or Pakistani).

2.   The hearing should be listed for three hours

3.   Any further evidence upon which either party would wish to rely  should
be submitted five working days before the hearing.



Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs  otherwise,  the  Appellant  is
granted anonymity.   No  report  of  these  proceedings  shall  directly  or
indirectly identify him or any  member  of  their  family.   This  direction
applies both to the Appellant and to  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply
with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.
