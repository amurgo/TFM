                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction and Background

 1. The Secretary of State appeals against a decision of Judge Oxlade  (the
    judge) of the First-tier Tribunal (the FtT) promulgated  on  20th  July
    2018.

 2. The Respondent before the Upper Tribunal was the Appellant  before  the
    FtT and I will refer to her as the Claimant.   She  is  a  national  of
    Turkey born 20th October 1990.  She entered the UK on 21st October 2015
    as the spouse of Mustafa Kanisirin (the Sponsor), a person present  and
    settled in the UK.  The Sponsor has indefinite leave  to  remain.   The
    Claimant had leave to remain until 29th June 2017.

 3. On 19th June 2017 she applied for further leave to remain by submitting
    form FLR(M).  This application was refused on 23rd  August  2017.   The
    Respondent was not satisfied that the Claimant satisfied the  financial
    requirements of Appendix FM of  the  Immigration  Rules,  and  was  not
    satisfied that she satisfied the English language requirements.

 4. The appeal was heard on 10th July 2018.  The judge found  that  at  the
    date of application the Claimant could not satisfy the English language
    requirements or financial requirements.

 5. The judge found that at the date of hearing the  Claimant  and  Sponsor
    had a combined income of �21,400 which is  in  excess  of  the  minimum
    annual income requirement of �18,600.  The English language requirement
    was still not satisfied at the date of hearing.  The judge  found  that
    the Claimant did not have the correct level of English qualification in
    that she had CEFR A1 but not A2.  The English language requirement  had
    changed since the Claimant was  granted  entry  clearance.   The  judge
    found that the Claimant was unable to take a further  English  language
    test because the Secretary of State  would  not  return  her  passport.
    Without that, the  Claimant  was  unable  to  take  a  further  English
    language test.

 6. The judge considered EX.1, and found no insurmountable obstacles to the
    Claimant and Sponsor continuing family life in Turkey.  The judge  then
    went on to consider Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules  and  found
    that  refusal  of  the  application  would  cause  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences, and therefore the appeal was allowed  with  reference  to
    Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

 7. The Secretary of State applied for permission to appeal.   The  grounds
    are lengthy but in summary contend that the consideration by the  judge
    of the financial requirement was flawed.  It  was  submitted  that  the
    judge had carried out  insufficient  analysis  and  given  insufficient
    reasons for findings.

 8. It was submitted that the judge had erred  by  not  providing  adequate
    reasons for finding unjustifiably harsh consequences would arise if the
    Claimant was not allowed to remain in the UK.  It  was  submitted  that
    the judge had not properly considered whether the Claimant could return
    to Turkey and apply for entry clearance, leaving the Sponsor in the UK,
    and the judge could not have concluded that entry clearance  was  bound
    to be granted.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Robertson of the FtT on  16th
    August 2018.

10. Directions were issued that there should be a hearing before the  Upper
    Tribunal to ascertain whether the FtT had erred in law  such  that  the
    decision must be set aside.

The Upper Tribunal Hearing

11. Miss Pal relied upon the grounds contained within the  application  for
    permission to appeal.  It was submitted that the judge  had  failed  to
    make adequate findings regarding the evidence as to  finance  submitted
    by the Claimant, and had failed to provide  adequate  reasons  for  the
    conclusion that the financial requirements were satisfied at  the  date
    of hearing.

12. It was  submitted  that  having  found  there  were  no  insurmountable
    obstacles to family life continuing in Turkey, the judge had  erred  by
    not considering whether the Claimant could return to Turkey to make  an
    application for entry clearance, without the Sponsor.  It was submitted
    that the judge had failed to adequately  explain  why  the  appeal  was
    allowed with reference to Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules.

13. Mr Singer in making oral submissions relied upon  a  rule  24  response
    dated 15th October 2018.  I was asked to accept that the judge had  not
    erred in finding that the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration
    Rules were not satisfied at the date of application, but  was  entitled
    to  find  that  at  the  date  of  hearing,  which  was  relevant  when
    considering an Article  8  appeal,  the  Claimant  and  Sponsor  had  a
    combined income of �21,400, which is in excess of the �18,600 per annum
    required by the Immigration Rules.  I was asked to note  there  was  no
    challenge to the finding that the combined income was  �21,400  at  the
    date of hearing.

14. Mr Singer submitted that the judge was entitled to  take  into  account
    paragraph 76 of MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10 which Mr  Singer  submitted
    indicated  that  some  aspects  of  the  Immigration  Rules  might   be
    considered more important than others.  For example  it  was  important
    that an applicant be financially  independent,  and  therefore  it  was
    important that the minimum annual financial requirement of �18,600  was
    met, whereas it might not be so important  if  some  of  the  specified
    evidence to prove that income was not submitted with the application.

15. I was asked to take into account that the  Claimant  had  not  realised
    that the English  language  requirements  had  altered  since  she  was
    granted entry clearance.  When she did appreciate this, she  wished  to
    undertake the required English  language  test  but  could  not  do  so
    because the Secretary of State would not  return  her  passport,  which
    meant that she could not enrol upon an English language course or  take
    the English language test without that passport to prove her identity.

16. Mr Singer submitted that the judge had taken all relevant factors  into
    account and conducted a balancing exercise.  The  judge  had  found  at
    paragraph 27 that if the Claimant was required to  leave  and  make  an
    entry clearance application, then the  financial  requirements  of  the
    rules could not be satisfied, because the  minimum  income  requirement
    could only be met if the combined income of the  Claimant  and  Sponsor
    were taken into account.

17. Mr Singer submitted that the judge had made findings open to her on the
    evidence and the decision could not be said to be perverse.  Mr  Singer
    conceded that the decision might be regarded  as  generous,  and  there
    would be other judges who may not have  made  the  same  decision.   Mr
    Singer made the point that this was not the appropriate test,  and  the
    grounds submitted by the Secretary of State did not disclose a material
    error of law, but disclosed a disagreement with the conclusion  reached
    by the judge.

18. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

19. The judge did not err in law at paragraph 38 in recording that  it  was
    conceded on behalf of the  Claimant,  that  the  English  language  and
    financial requirements were not satisfied at the date of application.

20. The judge at paragraph 39 explains why the financial requirements  were
    not satisfied at the date of application.  It is not suggested that the
    judge erred in law in so doing.

21. The judge at paragraph 40 found that the Claimant satisfied the minimum
    annual income requirement of �18,600 at the date of hearing.  I do  not
    find that the judge erred in law in  making  that  finding.   There  is
    ample documentary evidence contained within the  Claimant's  bundle  to
    prove that the Claimant and Sponsor at the date of hearing had a  gross
    combined income of �21,400.

22. The judge recorded at paragraph  41  that  it  was  conceded  that  the
    English language requirement contained within the Immigration Rules was
    still not met  at  the  date  of  hearing.   The  judge  explained  and
    clarified  this  at  paragraphs  42  -  43,  accepting  the  Claimant's
    explanation  that  she  did  not  realise  that  the  English  language
    requirements had changed after her arrival in the  UK  and  before  the
    date of her further application.  Documentary evidence shows that  that
    the Claimant's solicitors and MP sought a return  of  her  passport  to
    enable her to undertake the required English language test,  but  these
    requests were not granted.   I  find  no  error  of  law  disclosed  at
    paragraph 44 in which the judge finds that at the date of  hearing  the
    Claimant did not meet the Rules  solely  in  relation  to  the  English
    language requirement, and that the Secretary of State  had  effectively
    prevented the Claimant from the possibility of curing the defect.

23. It is not contended that the judge erred at paragraph 45 in finding  no
    insurmountable obstacles  to  family  life  continuing  in  Turkey  and
    therefore the Claimant could not succeed by relying on EX.1.

24. The judge did not err at paragraph 46 in referring  to  Agyarko  [2017]
    UKSC 11, and recognising that if the application for  leave  to  remain
    could not succeed by  satisfying  the  Immigration  Rules,  exceptional
    circumstances needed to be demonstrated, which would mean showing  that
    refusal  of  the  application  would  result  in  unjustifiably   harsh
    consequences so that it would be disproportionate.

25. The judge goes on to consider proportionality and records at  paragraph
    48 "the maintenance of immigration control is  clearly  in  the  public
    interest."  At paragraphs 48  -  50  the  judge  conducts  a  balancing
    exercise,  taking  into  account  section  117B  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.  The judge  found  that  the  Claimant
    spoke English sufficiently to meet CEFR A1 and found that the  evidence
    indicated that the Claimant was a committed student who  achieved  good
    grades, and that she had employment in the UK, and paid tax, was  in  a
    committed  relationship  with  her  husband,  and   had   no   previous
    convictions.  The judge was entitled to place some weight upon the fact
    that the Claimant had demonstrated that she wished  to  undertake  CEFR
    A2, but was unable to do so because the Secretary of  State  would  not
    return her passport.

26. My initial reaction upon reading the judge's decision was that it was a
    decision  that  could  be  described  as  being  generous  towards  the
    Claimant.  That is still my view.  I find myself in agreement  with  Mr
    Singer's submissions in which he conceded that the  decision  could  be
    described as generous, and that there would be  judges  who  would  not
    have made the same decision.  I agree with Mr Singer, in that  although
    that is undoubtedly true, that  is  not  the  appropriate  test  to  be
    considered.

27. I do not find that the decision by the judge is  perverse.   The  judge
    has adopted a correct legal approach by firstly considering whether the
    Immigration Rules can be satisfied, and in finding that they cannot, by
    considering whether the Secretary of State's decision would  result  in
    unjustifiably harsh consequences.

28. It is the finding that there are unjustifiably harsh consequences which
    is the primary reason for  the  Secretary  of  State  challenging  this
    decision.  In my view  the  judge  has  provided  adequate  reasons  to
    explain why she found unjustifiably  harsh  consequences  so  that  the
    Secretary of State's decision is disproportionate.  That is that at the
    date of hearing the only aspect of the Immigration Rules not  satisfied
    was the English language test, which the Claimant  had  indicated  that
    she would take if the Secretary of State would return her passport.  If
    the Claimant left the UK the Sponsor's income alone would  not  satisfy
    the  financial  requirements.   The  judge  in  the  circumstances  was
    entitled to find that this amounted to unjustifiably harsh consequences
    and would be disproportionate.

29. I therefore conclude that the judge  did  not  err  in  law,  has  made
    findings open to her on the evidence, and provided adequate reasons for
    those findings, so that it is apparent to a reader of the decision, why
    the decision was made.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FtT does not disclose a material error  of  law.   I  do
not set aside the decision.   The  appeal  of  the  Secretary  of  State  is
dismissed.

There was no application for  anonymity  and  I  see  no  need  to  make  an
anonymity direction.
