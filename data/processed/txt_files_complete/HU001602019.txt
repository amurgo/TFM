Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Hussain, instructed by Syeds Law Office.
For the Respondent:    Mr C Avery, Home Office Presenting Officer.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant seeks, with permission, to challenge the determination of
    the  First  Tier  Tribunal,  promulgated  on  25th  March  2019,  which
    dismissed the appellant's appeal  against  the  refusal  of  his  human
    rights claim (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights).

 2. The grounds of challenge dated 5th April 2019 to the  determination  of
    the First-tier Tribunal asserted

      i) the hearing on 11th March 2019 was not conducted fairly.  The court
         was invited to consider the witness statement  of  the  applicant's
         partner made on 4th April 2019 because the current  representatives
         had only recently been instructed.  It was asserted that the  judge
         interrupted the proceedings several times  during  the  questioning
         and during submissions.


     ii) the comment of the judge at paragraph 41 stated 'in addition I note
         that the appellant spoke English with a fairly strong  accent  that
         is plainly one from  outside  of  the  United  Kingdom.   That,  if
         nothing else, should have at the very least raised questions  about
         his country of birth and then questions about how he had settled in
         the  United  Kingdom'.  The  appellant  gave  evidence  without  an
         interpreter in English. There was no issue with regard his English.
          The comment was controversial  if  not  objectionable.  Alubankudi
         (Appearance of bias) [2015] 00542 (IAC) emphasised that judges must
         be  alert  to  the  sensitivities  and   perceptions   of   others,
         particularly in a multi-cultural society.


    iii) The judge erred at paragraph 47 in stating that Article 8  was  not
         engaged but there was a low threshold for such engagement and while
         the judge could  find  that  the  relationship  did  not  meet  the
         definition of a partner he erred in stating that Article 8 was  not
         engaged at all.


     iv) In relation to private life, the appellant had been present in  the
         UK for 17 years and 7 months at the  date  of  application  meaning
         that he was present in excess of  18  years  at  the  date  of  the
         hearing. The judge took a 'balance sheet' approach and noted points
         in the appellant's favour but simply  missed  the  'tolerent  (sic)
         [tolerated] presence' of the appellant which would also reduce  the
         public interest in removal. The Secretary of State had not  removed
         the appellant and that was a factor to be considered, R (Agyarko) v
         Secretary of  State  [2017]  UKSC  11.   The  factor  of  'tolerent
         presence' (sic) should have been a factor in the appellant's favour
         EB (Kosovo) v Secretary of State [2008] UKHL 41.  The  judge  erred
         in the weight he gave to the negative  factor  of  the  appellant's
         precarious status  as  opposed  to  the  reduction  of  the  public
         interest owing to the tolerance of the Secretary of  State  to  his
         presence.


 3. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Simpson
    on all grounds.   There  was,  however,  no  reason  given  as  to  why
    permission was granted.

 4. Following the hearing a statement of Dr Rebecca Suri  dated  4th  April
    2019 was submitted.  She outlined that the judge  was  very  aggressive
    towards their representative and 'kept  on  interrupting'.   She  added
    that  when  she  was  being  questioned  the  judge  would   stop   the
    representative halfway and start asking the purpose of the question  as
    if  running  out  of  patience.   The  judge  also  stated   that   the
    representative was answering questions on our behalf instead of letting
    the witnesses speak and it was a hostile situation.

 5. Dr Suri believed that the questioning  led  the  judge  to  record  the
    evidence incorrectly.  For example, at paragraph 2 the judge 'says that
    the appellant claimed to be running a business'.  Dr Suri  stated,  'no
    such claim was made'.  It also stated that the relationship was for  18
    months when in fact it was for 21 months. The witness stated  that  she
    told the judge she did not ask about the appellant's immigration status
    until sometime after the relationship started but the  judge  found  it
    not credible that Dr Suri did not ask before that. She stated  that  it
    was difficult to know how a fair judge could state that she should have
    known about his immigration status due to his accent. She  had  British
    citizen patients who could not speak a word of English.   Paragraph  42
    was contrary to what was said at the hearing.

 6. She added, it was not compulsively necessary to inform the council that
    the partner comes to live at times. At paragraph 42 there  was  nothing
    odd or vague about what was said in relation to the  council  tax.  The
    judge was more keen to show how he expected them to live.

 7. At paragraph 47 the judge effectively called  her  a  liar  because  he
    found that there was no relationship and  that  they  were  not  living
    together.  She was not trying to fake a relationship and  that  was  an
    insult to both her and the profession.

    The Hearing

 8.  At  the  hearing  before  me  Mr  Hussein  confirmed  that  the  legal
    representatives had  changed  and  that  he  had  not  represented  the
    appellant before the First-tier Tribunal. There  was  an  assertion  of
    bias and the judge had not approached the hearing with an open mind.

 9. It was accepted that the appellant was not living on a permanent  basis
    with Dr Suri and  that  she  had  not  informed  the  council  was  not
    relevant. The judge had imposed how he thought  a  relationship  should
    work. To find that there was no genuine relationship was  an  error  of
    law. Further, the judge had failed to consider that  the  Secretary  of
    State had not sought to remove  the  appellant  and  that  should  have
    reduced the weight to be given  to  the  public  interest.  Mr  Hussein
    confirmed that the appellant was not excluded on suitability grounds.

10. The Secretary of State's position was that  the  relationship  had  not
    endured for 2 years rather than it  was  not  genuine.   There  was  no
    statement  from  counsel  who  had  attended  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    hearing. Mr Avery submitted  that  to  succeed  a  statement  from  the
    previous solicitors  or  counsel  was  required  and  there  was  none.
    Paragraph 41 was possibly an unfortunate statement but overall  it  was
    not material.   The point  was  how  had  the  appellant's  immigration
    status not arisen before 2017?  It was open to the  judge  to  conclude
    there was no relationship in terms of an article 8 relationship.  There
    was a lack of documentary evidence and it was legitimate  to  look  for
    that. On the evidence before him, the judge's conclusions were open  to
    him.  The appellant 's position was precarious.  He had  not  lived  in
    the UK for 20 years but just over 17 years.  The approach of failure to
    remove him was not going to weigh heavily against the public interest

    Analysis

11. For the purposes of  this  appeal  it  is  important  to  set  out  the
    definition of partner under Appendix FM

         'GEN.1.2. For the purposes of this Appendix "partner" means-


         (i)      the applicant's spouse;


         (ii)     the applicant's civil partner;


         (iii)    the applicant's fianc�(e) or proposed civil partner; or


         (iv)     a person who has been living together with  the  applicant
         in a relationship akin to a marriage or civil  partnership  for  at
         least two  years  prior  to  the  date  of  application,  unless  a
         different meaning of partner applies elsewhere in this Appendix'.


12. The judge noted at the outset of  his  analysis  that  the  Immigration
    Rules could not  be  met  under  Appendix  FM.   Even  in  the  witness
    statement Dr Suri acknowledged  that  the  said  relationship  had  not
    existed for two years.  The judge found at [38]  that  the  appellant's
    case at tis highest was that they  had  been  living  together  for  24
    months at the date  of  the  hearing.  As  the  judge  also  noted  the
    appellant could not be  classified  as  a  fianc�e.   This  is  because
    Appendix FM contains the following provision.

         'E-LTRP.1.12. The applicant's partner  cannot  be  the  applicant's
         fianc�(e) or proposed  civil  partner,  unless  the  applicant  was
         granted entry clearance as  that  person's  fianc�(e)  or  proposed
         civil partner.


13. Thus, under the rules the appellant could not succeed as a  partner  or
    as a fianc�e. The  immigration  rules  set  out  the  position  of  the
    Secretary of State with regards  Article  8  and  must  be  taken  into
    account by the judge when making an assessment  under  Article  8,  and
    which was indeed undertaken in a more wide-ranging assessment.

14. Subsequent to the determination of the First-tier Tribunal being filed,
    Dr Suri submitted a witness statement with the grounds of appeal and on
    which Mr  Hussein  wished  to  rely.   I  have  set  out  the  specific
    complaints made in detail.  There is no audio record  of  the  hearing,
    but I have inspected the written Record of Proceedings.

15. The first question here is  whether  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is vitiated by apparent  bias  and  thus  unsustainable.    In
    particular paragraph 41 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  was
    relied upon by Mr Hussein.  At that paragraph the  First-tier  Tribunal
    judge found

         'I take the view that it is not credible that Dr Suri did  not  ask
         about the appellant's immigration status from the outset  of  their
         relationship given in  particular  the  feelings  that  she  states
         developed at an early stage.   It  is  reasonable  to  expect  that
         details of his immigration status would have arisen in  the  normal
         course of the finding out about a potential  husband's  background.
         It is not claimed he had lied  to  her.   She  states  that  issues
         relating to his  immigration  status  did  not  occur  to  her.  In
         addition, I note that the appellant spoke  English  with  a  fairly
         strong accent that is  plainly  one  from  outside  of  the  United
         Kingdom.  That, if nothing else, should  have  at  the  very  least
         raised questions about his country  of  birth  and  then  questions
         about how he had settled in the United Kingdom' [41].


16. Mr Sharma asserted that this displayed bias and the determination could
    not stand.  He referred to the witness statement of  Dr  Suri  and  the
    comment made by the judge at paragraph 41 which I have set out above.

17. I have also  considered  the  context  in  the  light  of  the  various
    authorities which have addressed the issue of bias and Porter v  Magill
    [2001] UKHL 67, at [103] held

         "The  question  is  whether  the  fair  minded   observer,   having
         considered  the  facts,  would  conclude  that  there  was  a  real
         possibility that the tribunal was bias."


         In Re Medicaments [2001] 1 WLR 700, the Court  of  Appeal  provided
         the following exposition of the task of the appellate,  or  review,
         court or tribunal:


             "The Court must first ascertain all  the  circumstances  which
             have a bearing on the suggestion that the Judge was  bias.  It
             must then ask whether those circumstances would  lead  a  fair
             minded and informed observer to conclude that there was a real
             possibility  that  the  Tribunal  was   bias.   The   material
             circumstances will include any explanation given by the  Judge
             under review as to his  knowledge  or  appreciation  of  those
             circumstances.""


18. Sivapatham (Appearance of Bias) [2017] UKUT 00293 (IAC)

         "Indications of a closed judicial mind, a  pre-determined  outcome,
         engage the appearance of bias principle and are likely to render  a
         hearing unfair.


         Provisional or preliminary judicial views are permissible, provided
         that an open mind is maintained."


19. No complaint was made prior to the promulgation of the decision. At  no
    point did the counsel instructed at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  hearing
    submit any statement making any reference to poor conduct on behalf  of
    the judge and there is no evidence that  any  statement  from  previous
    counsel was requested.  I observed  no  statement  from  the  appellant
    making complaint of the conduct of proceedings.

20. The record of proceedings  show  that  the  appellant's  representative
    asked a series of questions of the appellant, indeed over  a  third  of
    the questions asked  by  both  representatives,  and  it  is  generally
    accepted, although the Tribunal may govern (within  the  parameters  of
    the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014 ('the FtT Rules') its own procedure and  there  are
    no strict rules of evidence,  that the signed  witness  statement  will
    stand as evidence in chief for a witness.  The appellant had  submitted
    a witness statement dated 4th March 2019 which ran to 31 paragraphs. Dr
    Suri submitted a one-page letter dated 1st March 2019 and  a  two  page
    witness statement, which included the statement 'I write this letter in
    support that you please consider Jag's application for indefinite  stay
    in this country  positively  and  favourably'.  The  witness  statement
    commented on why she was not prepared to travel to India to marry.

21. The overriding objective under Rule 2 of the FtT Rules  enjoins  judges
    to conduct proceedings in accordance with the overriding objective  and
    fairly and justly engaging the following criteria

         2.-      (1)  The overriding objective of these Rules is to  enable
             the Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.


             (2) Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes-


                  (a)  dealing with the case in ways which are proportionate
                  to the importance of the case, the complexity of the
                  issues, the anticipated costs and the resources of the
                  parties and of the Tribunal;


                  (b)  avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking
                  flexibility in the proceedings;


                  (c)  ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are
                  able to participate fully in the proceedings;


                  (d)  using any special expertise of the Tribunal
                  effectively; and


                  (e)  avoiding delay, so far as compatible with proper
                  consideration of the issues.


22. Questions may be asked  for  clarification  and  expansion  but  it  is
    evident that the appellant was asked  in  detail  about  matters  which
    should have been included in his witness statement, such as his ties to
    India, his job prospects and his family in India and the impact of  his
    said partner as to why he could not return to India and make  an  Entry
    Clearance application.

23. It is clear however, that the judge  also  permitted  expansion  on  Dr
    Suri's witness statement by the appellant's representative and that  he
    repeated information which was in her witness statement as to  why  she
    was 'not prepared to travel to India in order to marry' her fianc�e and
    explored information which should have been in the statement.  Although
    that is not a particular criticism of the representative  and  one  not
    made by the judge, it is  noteworthy  that  the  judge  thus  permitted
    considerable examination in chief,  which  included  expansion  of  the
    evidence which departed from the statements  for  both  the  witnesses.
    The judge also, and further, permitted re-examination of the  appellant
    by his representative.  At the close of re-examination there is a  note
    to the effect that there was  further  cross  examination  because  the
    appellant's representative re-examination (questions) had been  'beyond
    the scope of re-exam'.

24. Nothing in the record of proceedings includes any reference  or  record
    to objections taken by either representative to  any  interruptions  by
    the judge or any objection to the conduct of the proceedings generally.
     I also note that Dr Suri was recorded, as is proper, to  have  stepped
    out of the court until the appellant had  concluded  his  evidence  and
    this would have taken some time, when  comparing  the  notes  taken  in
    relation to the appellant's and her oral evidence.

25. Dr  Suri  also  commented  that  the  nature  of  the  conduct  of  the
    proceedings led the judge to  record  the  evidence  incorrectly.   For
    example, at paragraph 2 of the determination she states that the  judge
    'says that the appellant claimed to be running a  business'.   Dr  Suri
    confirmed 'no such claim was made'.

26. In the application, which was part  of  the  bundle  submitted  by  the
    appellant's  representatives  exactly  that  claim  was  made  in   the
    solicitors' covering letter with the application. I can understand that
    Dr Suri will not be aware of all  the  information  placed  before  the
    judge and, further, that she was not in the court room, as was  proper,
    when the appellant was being questioned and thus she would not be aware
    of what was said by the appellant to  found  the  observations  by  the
    judge in paragraph 42.  As set out in Porter v McGill  the  fair-minded
    observer must be informed and the court must first  ascertain  all  the
    circumstances.  The substance of the complaint was founded by  Dr  Suri
    who was either not party to the whole of the oral  proceedings  or  not
    aware, and why should she be, of  the  totality  of  the  documentation
    submitted on behalf of the appellant.

27. It is important to note that the judge, (and  judges  often  deal  with
    long lists of cases), must comply  with  the  overriding  objective  to
    avoid delay and conduct the proceedings proportionately and fairly.

28. I turn to paragraph 41 which commented on the appellant's accent.

         "Alubankudi (Appearance of bias) [2015] UKUT 00542  (IAC)  held  at
         the second paragraph of the headnote.


             'The interface between the judiciary and society is of greater
             importance nowadays than it has ever been.  Judges  must  have
             their antennae tuned to the  immediate  and  wider  audiences,
             alert  to  the  sensitivities  and  perceptions   of   others,
             particularly in a multi-cultural society'"


29. It is important to identify at this point that the reasoning  given  at
    [41] and throughout by the judge was in stages.  As Mr Avery  contended
    it would have been most surprising if the question of  status  had  not
    been raised in the relationship and that must be the case  particularly
    if the appellant and Dr Suri were engaged because it would lead to  the
    subject of where they were going to settle.

30. The findings made by the judge including the following

      i) it was clear that the Immigration Rules could not be met as at  the
         date of the application on the basis of the appellant's family life
         with Dr  Suri.  Under  the  provisions  of  paragraph  GEN.1.2.  of
         Appendix FM she [Dr Suri] did  not  qualify  as  his  partner.  The
         appellant could not comply with the Immigration Rules.


     ii) At its highest the appellant's case was that  he  had  been  living
         with Dr Suri for two and a  half  years  as  at  the  date  of  the
         hearing.


    iii) There were inconsistencies in the  evidence  and  it  was  for  the
         appellant to establish the facts about the relationship


     iv) The appellant resiled from his evidence that he lived with Dr  Suri
         for most of the time by saying that he lived with her for  half  of
         the time (Dr Suri gave oral evidence that it  was  4-5  days  every
         week [25]


      v) The reasons given for not living with her differed from those given
         by Dr Suri (she did not state that it was because her parents would
         not allow it)


     vi) The address on the application form was that of the brother and  it
         was not credible that he would put his brother's address if he were
         living with her.


    vii) Dr Suri's letter made no mention of any engagement  and  there  was
         minimal documentary evidence in support


   viii) Dr Suri did not know about  the  appellant's  parents'  immigration
         status.


     ix) There was minimal documentary evidence to support the relationship


      x) The letters [dated 2019] from  family  and  friends  including  the
         appellant's brother, sister and brother in law are  all  silent  on
         the issue of the relationship.


31. It was thus open to the judge to find that the evidence did not support
    the contention of a close relationship.

32. In the context of the findings of the judge overall, it is not apparent
    that there was bias. The judge specifically prefaced his  statement  at
    [41] that 'it was reasonable to expect that details of his  immigration
    status would have arisen in the normal course of finding  out  about  a
    potential husband's background'.  There is nothing  in  that  which  is
    objectionable and if there is a closeness and a desire to marry  it  is
    the subject of natural discussion in any relationship, particularly  as
    the location of the home would  need  to  be  decided.    That  is  the
    context in which  the  finding  of  the  judge  was  made.   The  judge
    proceeded to state 'in  addition,  I  note  that  the  appellant  spoke
    English with a fairly strong accent' and this should have prompted  the
    thought that he did not have immigration status'.  Whilst that may  not
    necessarily be logical it is a  comment  couched  within  other  cogent
    reasoning.  There is no other suggestion that the judge was in any  way
    biased against immigration or that he purported to draw on  specialised
    knowledge for the assessment the  evidence  (and  without  putting  the
    point to the parties) contrary to MD (Judge's  knowledge,  standard  of
    English) [2009] UKIAT 13.

33. The finding at [41] reflects the judge's view  of  the  nature  of  the
    relationship and it was open to him to question the  account  given  to
    him as indeed is his role when assessing the evidence. The comments are
    couched in the assessment of the  context  of  the  feelings  that  the
    witness stated  that  she  had  for  the  appellant.   In  her  witness
    statement the witness stated that they were 'inseparable'.

34. I do not find that a fair minded and informed observer, that is someone
    who is neither complacent  nor  unduly  sensitive  would  find  on  the
    evidence that the judge approached the matter with  a  closed  mind.  I
    have read the decision as a whole and conclude that  the  reasoning  is
    cogent and essentially based on an insufficiency of  evidence  (notably
    the letters from the appellant's relatives), and  an  inconsistency  in
    evidence provided.

35. The question of the appellant's status would have naturally  be  raised
    and it was incumbent on the  appellant  to  be  frank  with  his  close
    friends as to his  status  and  particularly  if  he  intended  a  more
    permanent and intimate relationship.

36. The comment at [43] in relation to council tax is not axiomatic to  the
    findings.  There was no evidence before the judge from the council,  to
    the effect that Dr Suri was not living alone at the property or  rather
    that the appellant was listed at the property and the  judge's  comment
    was  focussed  on  the  vague  nature  of  the  explanation  for   that
    information not being conveyed to the council.  In  that  framing,  the
    judge also found at [44] that albeit the appellant  had  mentioned  his
    relationship in the application, when asked  in  his  application  form
    where he lived, he had given his brother's address.  This form  advises
    that the Secretary of State  is  to  be  advised  immediately  if  this
    changes. The correspondence address was again  different  and  not  the
    witness' address.  None of this information considered in the round led
    the judge to believe that the relationship was as secure and  permanent
    as the appellant had asserted.

37. In the light of the judge's findings, which I have cited above, it  was
    open to him to find that the asserted intimate relationship was not  an
    Article 8 protected relationship.  The judge did not find there was  no
    relationship but that for the purposes of Article 8, having  found  the
    immigration rules  did  not  apply,  and  on  his  own  assessment  the
    relationship the evidence was deficient, the relationship was not  such
    that attracted the protection of Article  8  on  family  life  grounds.
    Specifically, at [45] the judge identified that the letters of  support
    from family and friends were silent on the  issue  of  the  engagement.
    The criticism that the appellant's parents' immigration status remained
    unknown reflects the lack of information passed to the appellant's said
    fianc�e.

38. There is a distinction between Article 8 family life and  private  life
    which can encompass relationships.   On the evidence as provided it was
    open to the judge to find that, at the date  of  the  hearing,  he  was
    unable to find an Article 8 protected right in terms  of  family  life.
    That extended to the appellant's relationship with his own family,  and
    in line with Kugathas v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home  Department
    [2003] EWCA Civ 31.  Although the judge found that  the  said  romantic
    relationship lacked the quality, stability and nature for family  life,
    he did find an Article 8 protected private life and this  included  the
    relationship with Dr Suri.

39. Therefore, contrary to the grounds the judge  did  consider  Article  8
    private  life  to  be  engaged  because  he   proceeded   to   a   full
    proportionality assessment finding that the appellant could not  comply
    with Appendix FM or paragraph 276ADE.  The appellant had only lived  in
    the UK for 17 years, as at the date of application, and there  were  no
    significant obstacles to his return to India where he had the necessary
    skills to find work. The judge addressed the issue of the mental health
    of the appellant and the assertion of earlier poor  immigration  advice
    and found there  was  little  by  way  of  correspondence  to  evidence
    complaint. Overall the appellant  knew  that  he  was  in  the  country
    unlawfully  and  that  his  immigration  status  had  throughout   been
    precarious.  Having  factored  in  Section  117  of  the   Nationality,
    Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and adopted a  balance  sheet  approach
    the judge's approach was  lawful  and  he  was  entitled  to  find  the
    decision of the Secretary of State to be proportionate, bearing in mind
    the following.

40. With regard the last ground and the 'toleration' by  the  Secretary  of
    State of the appellant's presence, the judge did not  accept  that  the
    appellant was unaware that his immigration presence had  been  decided.
    This was not specifically included or set out in the grounds of  appeal
    to the First-tier Tribunal and there was merely  a  reference  made  in
    submissions that it was the 'HO own fault' not to 'remove him in 2004'.



41. It is necessary to read the reference to protracted delay in removal on
    the part of the Secretary of State, in  the  judgment  of  R  (Agyarko)
    [2017] UKSC 11 in context.

42. At paragraph 52 Lord Reed stated as follows

         "51.     ... If, on the other hand, an applicant - even if residing
         in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise certain to be granted leave to
         enter, at least if an application were made from outside the UK,
         then there might be no public interest in his or her removal. The
         point is illustrated by the decision in Chikwamba v Secretary of
         State for the Home Department.


         52.      It is also necessary to bear in mind that the cogency of
         the public interest in the removal of a person living in the UK
         unlawfully is liable to diminish - or, looking at the matter from
         the opposite perspective, the weight to be given to precarious
         family life is liable to increase - if there is a protracted delay
         in the enforcement of immigration control. This point was made by
         Lord Bingham and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood in EB (Kosovo) v
         Secretary of State for the Home Department [2008] UKHL 41; [2009]
         AC 1159, paras 15 and 37. It is also illustrated by the judgment of
         the European court in Jeunesse.


         53.      Finally, in relation to this matter, the reference in the
         instruction to "full knowledge that their stay here is unlawful or
         precarious" is also consistent with the case law of the European
         court, which refers to the persons concerned being aware that the
         persistence of family life in the host state would be precarious
         from the outset (as in Jeunesse, para 108). One can, for example,
         envisage circumstances in which people might be under a reasonable
         misapprehension as to their ability to maintain a family life in
         the UK, and in which a less stringent approach might therefore be
         appropriate."


43. It is important to realise first, that this relates to family life  and
    the judge found no family life in the  United  Kingdom.   Secondly  the
    judge  effectively  applied   Agyarko   when   considering   compelling
    circumstances or rather whether  there  would  be  unjustifiably  harsh
    consequences on removal.  The courts have repeatedly acknowledged  that
    a state has the right to  control  its  borders  and  as  explained  in
    Agyarko it is only in exceptional circumstances, which are not  present
    here, that removal will constitute a violation of Article 8:

         "54.     As explained in para 49 above, the European court has said
         that, in cases concerned with precarious family life, it is
         "likely" only to be in exceptional circumstances that the removal
         of the non-national family member will constitute a violation of
         article 8. That reflects the weight attached to the contracting
         states' right to control their borders, as an attribute of their
         sovereignty, and the limited weight which is generally attached to
         family life established in the full knowledge that its continuation
         in the contracting state is unlawful or precarious. The court has
         repeatedly acknowledged that "a state is entitled, as a matter of
         well-established international law, and subject to its treaty
         obligations, to control the entry of non-nationals into its
         territory and their residence there" (Jeunesse, para 100). As the
         court has made clear, the Convention is not intended to undermine
         that right by enabling non-nationals to evade immigration control
         by establishing a family life while present in the host state
         unlawfully or temporarily, and then presenting it with a fait
         accompli. On the contrary, "where confronted with a fait accompli
         the removal of the non-national family member by the authorities
         would be incompatible with article 8 only in exceptional
         circumstances" (Jeunesse, para 114).


         55.      That statement reflects the strength of  the  claim  which
         will normally be required, if the contracting state's  interest  in
         immigration control is to be outweighed."


44. The question of delay was addressed by Lord Bingham  again  largely  in
    relation to relationships being formed, in EB Kosovo [2008] UKHL 41 but
    also in relation to private life for example by  the  delay  permitting
    the strengthening and development of closer personal ties  and  further
    it was held that

         "15.     Delay may be relevant in a second, less obvious,  way.  An
             immigrant without leave to  enter  or  remain  is  in  a  very
             precarious situation, liable to be removed at  any  time.  Any
             relationship into which such an applicant enters is likely  to
             be, initially, tentative, being entered into under the  shadow
             of severance by administrative order. ...  A  relationship  so
             entered into may well be imbued with a sense of  impermanence.
             But if months pass without a decision to  remove  being  made,
             and months become years, and year succeeds year, it is  to  be
             expected that this sense of impermanence  will  fade  and  the
             expectation will grow that if the authorities had intended  to
             remove the applicant they would have taken  steps  to  do  so.
             This  result  depends  on  no  legal  doctrine   but   on   an
             understanding of how, in some cases, minds may  work,  and  it
             may affect the proportionality of removal.


         16.      Delay may be relevant, thirdly,  in  reducing  the  weight
             otherwise to be accorded to the requirements of firm and  fair
             immigration control, if the delay is shown to be the result of
             a   dysfunctional   system   which    yields    unpredictable,
             inconsistent and unfair outcomes.  In  the  present  case  the
             appellant's cousin, who entered the country  and  applied  for
             asylum at the same time and whose position is not said  to  be
             materially different, was granted exceptional leave to remain,
             during the two-year period which it  took  the  respondent  to
             correct its  erroneous  decision  to  refuse  the  appellant's
             application on grounds of non-compliance. In the  case  of  JL
             (Sierra Leone), heard by the Court of Appeal at the same  time
             as the present case, there was a somewhat similar  pattern  of
             facts. JL escaped from Sierra Leone with her  half-brother  in
             1999 and claimed asylum. In 2000  her  claim  was  refused  on
             grounds of non-compliance. As in  the  appellant's  case  this
             decision was erroneous, as the respondent recognised  eighteen
             months later. In February 2006 the  half-brother  was  granted
             humanitarian protection. She was not. A  system  so  operating
             cannot be said to be  "predictable,  consistent  and  fair  as
             between one applicant and another" or as yielding "consistency
             of treatment between one aspiring immigrant and  another".  To
             the extent that this is shown to be so, it may have a  bearing
             on  the  proportionality  of  removal,  or  of  requiring   an
             applicant to  apply  from  out  of  country.  As  Carnwath  LJ
             observed  in  Akaeke  v  Secretary  of  State  for  the   Home
             Department [2005] EWCA Civ 947, [2005] INLR 575, para 25:


                  "Once it is accepted that unreasonable delay on  the  part
                  of the Secretary of State is capable of being  a  relevant
                  factor,  then  the  weight  to  be  given  to  it  in  the
                  particular case was a matter for the tribunal""


45. First, the judge did not accept that there was an Article  8  protected
    family life, not least through lack of compliance with the  immigration
    rules but also on his own assessment  of  the  relationship.   Secondly
    when turning to private life he assessed the nature and strength of the
    private life in the form of friendships and family ties, and  found  it
    outweighed by the need for immigration control.  Thirdly there  was  no
    acceptance that the system was dysfunctional in that it had  failed  to
    inform the appellant of his status or that the system  had  yielded  an
    inconsistent or unfair outcome.

46. The proportionality assessment was undertaken in a balanced manner,  on
    the evidence, with the relevant factors properly  weighed.   I  do  not
    find the judge conducted the hearing in an unfair or biased  manner  or
    that his findings displayed a closed mind.

47. For the reasons given above, I find no arguable material error  of  law
    in the determination of the First-tier Tribunal which will stand.
