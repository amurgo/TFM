                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals on  behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
   Officer from the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Rosalyn
   Choudhury sitting at Hatton Cross on 6  June  2017)  allowing  on  human
   rights (Article 8  ECHR)  grounds  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
   decision of an Entry Clearance Officer to refuse her entry clearance for
   the purposes of settlement with her British national spouse.  The First-
   tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and I do not consider
   that such a direction is required for these  proceedings  in  the  Upper
   Tribunal.



The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

2. On 21 December 2017, Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Martin  granted  the  Entry
   Clearance Officer permission to appeal for the following reasons: "It is
   arguable, as asserted in the grounds, that the Judge erred in concluding
   that the [claimant] met the requirement's Immigration Rules when she had
   not produced the required documents to the Entry Clearance Officer.   It
   is also argued that the Judge has given no reason why the appeal  should
   be allowed under Article 8, when if it was the case that she  could  now
   meet the Rules, she could make a fresh application."

Relevant Background

3. The claimant is a national of Somalia, whose date of  birth  is  6  June
   1986.  She says that she is a refugee from Somalia who  fled  to  Egypt.
   It is from Egypt that she applied for entry clearance as a partner under
   Appendix FM of the  Immigration  Rules.   The  sponsor  originates  from
   Somalia, but he has become a British national.

4. On 2 February 2016, an ECO in Amman gave his reasons  for  refusing  the
   claimant's application for entry clearance.  He was  not  satisfied  (a)
   that her marriage to the sponsor was valid; (b)  that  her  relationship
   with the sponsor was genuine and subsisting or  that  they  intended  to
   live together permanently in the UK; (c) that she had provided specified
   documents as evidence of her sponsor's gross income from his employment;
   (d) that she had demonstrated that there would be adequate accommodation
   for her to occupy with her sponsor without recourse to public funds; and
   (e) that she had provided the required evidence to show that she met the
   English language requirement.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-Tier Tribunal

5. At the hearing before Judge Choudhury, the claimant was  represented  by
   Counsel.  There was no Presenting Officer.  In her subsequent  decision,
   the Judge set out her findings of fact  and  conclusions  at  paragraphs
   [19]-[31].  She addressed each of the concerns raised by the  ECO.   She
   found that the sponsor had divorced his previous wife in  2005,  and  so
   was free to marry the claimant, which he had done in  Somalia  in  2007,
   and again in Egypt in 2009.  After reviewing the additional  documentary
   evidence provided by way of appeal, the Judge found  that  the  claimant
   "has in fact satisfied the financial  requirements  of  the  Immigration
   Rules."  The Judge found that the accommodation requirement was met; and
   that, as submitted by Counsel, the ECO had erred in law in requiring the
   language certificate relied upon by the claimant to satisfy Appendix  O.
   The Judge continued as follows:

        30.   As I find the Rules are met (these being a reflection  of  the
             respondent's policy on how a fair  balance  is  to  be  struck
             between  the  public  interest   and   maintaining   effective
             Immigration control, and an individual's right  to  enjoy  his
             private/family life) the only conclusion is that there  is  no
             public interest in preventing the appellant from entering  the
             United Kingdom to join her sponsor husband.

        31.   I find in all the circumstances presented that  the  appellant
             ought to be granted entry clearance as the decision to  refuse
             her was a disproportionate one.



The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

6. At the hearing before me to determine whether an error of law  was  made
   out,  Ms  Everett  developed  the  case  advanced  in   the   permission
   application.  Mr Akram, on behalf of the claimant, acknowledged that the
   letter from the sponsor's employer did not  contain  all  the  specified
   information stipulated in Appendix FM-SE.  However,  he  submitted  that
   the Judge did not materially err in  concluding  that  the  interference
   with family life consequential upon the refusal decision was in all  the
   circumstances disproportionate.

Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

7. In MM (Lebanon) [2017] UKSC 10, the Supreme  Court  concluded  that  the
   challenge to the  acceptability  in  principle  of  the  minimum  income
   requirement  (MIR)  must  fail,  and  went  on  to  make  some   further
   observations which are pertinent to Mr Akram's defence  of  the  Judge's
   approach:

    98.  It is apparent from  the  MAC  report,  and  the  evidence  of  Mr
         Peckover, the reasons for adopting a stricter approach in  the  new
         Rules  were  met  as  a  practicality  rather  than  wider  policy,
         reflecting what the MAC acknowledged to be the relative uncertainty
         and difficult of verification of such sources.  That did  not  make
         it unreasonable or irrational for the Secretary of  State  to  take
         this into account in formulating the Rules.  The MAC recognised the
         strength of the case for taking account of other sources,  but  did
         not in terms advise against the approach ultimately adopted by  the
         Secretary of State.  In considering the legality of that  approach,
         for the reasons already discussed (para. 59 above) it is  necessary
         to distinguish between two aspects: first, the rationality of  this
         aspect of the Rules or instructions under  common  law  principles,
         and secondly the compatibility with the HRA of similar restrictions
         as part of a consideration outside the Rules.  As  for  the  first,
         while the application of these restrictions may seem harsh and even
         capricious  in  some  cases,   the   matter   was   given   careful
         consideration by both the MAC  and  the  Secretary  of  State.   As
         Aikens LJ said (para 154), the decision was "not take on  a  whim".
         In argue, it was not irrational in the common  law  sense  for  the
         Secretary of State to give priority in the Rules to the  simplicity
         of operation and the ease of verification.

    99.  Operation of the same restrictive approach outside the Rules is  a
         different matter, in our view is much  more  difficult  to  justify
         under the HRA.  This is not because "less intrusive" methods  might
         be devised (as Blake J attempted to do: para 147), but  because  it
         is inconsistent with the character of evaluation  which  article  8
         requires.  As has been seen, avoiding a  financial  burden  on  the
         state can be relevant to the fair balance required by the  Article.
         But that  judgment  cannot  properly  be  constrained  by  a  rigid
         restriction in the Rules.  Certainly, nothing that is said  in  the
         instructions to Case Officers can prevent the  tribunal  on  appeal
         from looking at the matter more broadly.  These are not matters  of
         policy on which special weight has to be accorded to  the  judgment
         of the Secretary  of  State.   There  is  nothing  to  prevent  the
         tribunal, in the context of the HRA appeal, from judging for itself
         the reliability of any alternative sources of finance in the  light
         of the evidence before it. ...."

8. Although the topic under discussion in paragraphs [98] and [99] above is
   the treatment of alternative sources of funding, as distinct  from  non-
   compliance with the evidential requirements of  Appendix  FM-SE,  it  is
   supportive of Mr Akram's argument that, when addressing proportionality,
   the judicial decision-maker is not constrained "by a  rigid  restriction
   in the Rules", but can look at the matter more broadly.

9. However, the Judge did not  clearly  distinguish  between  the  position
   under the Rules and a broader assessment outside the Rules.

10. In the refusal  decision,  the  ECO  identified  three  areas  in  which
   specified documents or evidence had not been  submitted  to  demonstrate
   that the sponsor was earning at least  �18,600  gross  per  annum.   The
   first was that the claimant  had  only  submitted  6  payslips  for  the
   required 6-month period; the second was that the  bank  statements  were
   not in the correct format, and they did not  cover  the  entire  6-month
   period; and the third was that the letter submitted from  the  sponsor's
   employer, Metroline, did not confirm how long the sponsor had been  paid
   at the rate relied upon in the application (�30,000), nor did it confirm
   the nature of his employment.

11. This was not a points-based-system appeal, and so the Judge  could  take
   into account documentary evidence that had not been  provided  with  the
   application.  It is not suggested by way of appeal to the Upper Tribunal
   that the Judge did not give adequate reasons for  finding  that  by  the
   date of the hearing the claimant had now provided the required run of  6
   months' payslips and 6  months'  bank  statements  as  evidence  of  the
   sponsor's gross income in  the  6-month  period  prior  to  the  refusal
   decision.

12. However, the Judge did not adequately address the  concern  raised  over
   the employer's letter.  At paragraph [36], she said that  she  also  had
   had regard to the "updated" employer's letter of 12  May  2017,  stating
   that the sponsor continued to be employed full-time as a bus  driver  at
   �33,632 per annum.

13. In order to comply with the Rules, the claimant  needed  to  produce  an
   employer's letter which addressed the  deficiencies  identified  in  the
   refusal decision.  The employer needed to state in writing for how  long
   the  sponsor  had  been  receiving  the  salary  relied  upon   in   the
   application.   Moreover,  insofar  as  it  is  material,   the   updated
   employer's letter replicated the defect of the earlier letter: it failed
   to specify for how long the sponsor had  been  employed  at  a  rate  of
   �33,632 per annum.

14. As the Judge found that the claimant had  complied  with  the  Rules  in
   every relevant respect, the Judge did not purport to allow the appeal on
   Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.  She  allowed  the  appeal  on  the
   simple ground that, as the claimant had complied with the Rules, it  was
   disproportionate to maintain the refusal.  If the Judge had  been  right
   that the claimant met all the relevant requirements of  the  Rules,  her
   decision would have been unimpeachable. However, she  erred  in  finding
   that the claimant met the financial requirements of the  Rules.  So  her
   decision is vitiated by a material error of law such that it must be set
   aside and re-made.

The Re-making of the Decision

15. The representatives were in agreement that, if an error of law was  made
   out, I could remake the decision without a further  hearing  or  further
   evidence.

16. I answer questions 1 and 2 of the Razgar test in favour of the  claimant
   as the effect of the refusal  decision  as  to  prevent  family  reunion
   between husband and wife in the United Kingdom.  Questions 3  and  4  of
   the Razgar test must be  answered  in  favour  of  the  Entry  Clearance
   Officer.  On the issue of  proportionality,  I  take  into  account  the
   relevant considerations arising under section  117B  of  the  2002  Act,
   insofar as they are applicable.

17. I consider that there are compelling  circumstances  which  justify  the
   claimant being granted Article 8 relief outside the Rules.

18. Firstly, the response of  the  Entry  Clearance  Manager  (ECM)  to  the
   additional financial documents served  with  the  notice  of  appeal  is
   ambiguous.  It is susceptible to the  interpretation  that  the  ECM  no
   longer had any concern about the MIR, but remained concerned  about  the
   other requirements of the Rules in respect of which the claimant had not
   served any further documentary evidence  (e.g.  on  the  issues  of  the
   sponsor's freedom to marry, the subsistence  of  the  relationship,  the
   language requirement etc). The ECM does  not  indicate  that  he  has  a
   continuing concern over  the  absence  of  an  employer's  letter  which
   contains all the required specified information.

19. The ECM could ascertain from the payslips - each  of  which  contains  a
   running total for the amount earned so far in the financial year -  that
   the sponsor must have been paid a salary of over �30,000 since at  least
   the beginning of the financial year. If the only issue in the appeal had
   been compliance with the evidential requirements specified  in  Appendix
   FM-SE, the ECM might therefore have  expressly  applied  the  evidential
   flexibility provisions in Appendix FM-SE to  the  claimant's  advantage.
   But as there were many other issues - all of which the claimant went  on
   to address successfully at the hearing of the appeal  which  took  place
   more than a year after the refusal - the claimant was deprived  of  this
   possible safety-net.

20. Secondly and in any event, (a) having  successfully  addressed  all  the
   other requirements of the Rules put in issue by the ECO, and (b)  having
   established on the balance of probabilities that the sponsor was earning
   well in excess of the MIR at the date of application and subsequently  -
   so as to avoid by a considerable  margin  the  threat  of  the  claimant
   becoming a burden on the state - looking at the matter more broadly,  as
   I empowered to do, I consider that the maintenance of  the  decision  to
   refuse which was made over two years  ago  is  disproportionate  to  the
   legitimate public end sought to be achieved, namely the  maintenance  of
   firm and effective  immigration  controls  and  the  protection  of  the
   country's economic wellbeing.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal  contained  an  error  of  law,  and
accordingly the  decision  is  set  aside  and  the  following  decision  is
substituted:

This appeal is allowed on Article 8 grounds outside the Rules.

I make no anonymity direction.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal, I have given consideration as  to  whether  to
make a fee award in respect of any fee which has been paid  or  is  payable,
and I have decided to make no fee award as  the  claimant  needed  to  bring
forward further evidence by way  of  appeal  in  order  to  succeed  in  her
appeal.
