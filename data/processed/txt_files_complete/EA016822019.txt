                            DECISION AND REASONS

Direction Regarding Anonymity - Rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure  (Upper
Tribunal) Rules 2008

 1. Unless and until a Tribunal or court directs otherwise,  the  appellant
    is granted anonymity.  No report of these proceedings shall directly or
    indirectly identify him or any member of their family.  This  direction
    applies both to the appellant and to the respondent.  Failure to comply
    with this direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings.

 2. This is an appeal against the decision  issued  11  September  2019  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson which refused the protection and human
    rights claim of MH.

 3. MH is a citizen of Albania born in 1988.  He entered the  UK  in  2012,
    doing so illegally, using a false Greek identity  card.   On  6  August
    2012 he was arrested for production of a controlled drug -  Class  B  -
    Cannabis  and  on  1  November  2012  was  sentenced  to   27   months'
    imprisonment.  He served seven months of his sentence and then used the
    Facilitated Return Scheme and was deported to Albania on 5 March  2013.
    It is undisputed that shortly afterwards  in  2014  the  appellant  re-
    entered the UK illegally and in breach of the deportation order and has
    remained  ever  since.  It  is  also  undisputed  that  he   formed   a
    relationship with a dual Argentinian/Spanish national, L, and on 7 July
    2017 applied for an EEA residence card as her unmarried partner.  On  6
    October 2018 he married  L  and  on  17  October  2018  applied  for  a
    residence card showing  him  to  be  the  spouse  of  a  qualified  EEA
    national.

 4. The respondent refused the  application  for  a  residence  card  in  a
    decision dated 26 March 2019.  The respondent relied on Regulation  24
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016  (the  EEA
    Regulations)  maintaining  that  refusal  of  the  residence  card  was
    justified on the grounds of public policy, public  security  or  public
    health  as  defined  in  Regulation  27.   The  respondent  found   the
    appellant's personal conduct shown by the criminal offence committed in
    2012 and the appellant's immigration history, entering the UK illegally
    twice, the second time in breach of a deportation order, meant that  he
    posed a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to fundamental
    interests of the UK.  The respondent went on to find that the  decision
    to refuse the residence card was proportionate.

 5. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal and the  appeal  came
    before First-tier Tribunal Judge Watson on 9 September 2019.

 6. In paragraphs 18 to 37  of  her  decision,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Watson considered whether the appellant met the provisions of paragraph
    27(5)(c). She concluded that the appellant's criminal offences and  his
    "disregard" for immigration laws showed  his  conduct  to  represent  a
    genuine,  present  and  sufficiently  serious  threat  to   fundamental
    interests of the UK.  In paragraphs 38 to 44 of the decision the  judge
    found that the refusal of a  residence  card  was  proportionate  after
    applying the criteria set out in Regulation 27(6) and Schedule 1 of the
    EEA Regulations.

 7. The first ground of appeal challenges the finding  that  the  appellant
    posed a genuine, present and sufficiently serious risk  to  fundamental
    interests of the UK. Paragraph 12 of  the  grounds  maintains  that  in
    paragraphs 18 and 22  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  disclosed  a
    material error of fact in this assessment. The judge said this:

         "18.     The fundamental interests of society which are relevant in
             this Appeal are listed in Schedule 1 above.   The  Appellant's
             offence is a conviction for supply of class A drugs listed  as
             contrary to the fundamental  interests  of  society  (Schedule
             1.7.(g)).

         ...

         22.  The Appellant has shown that he was prepared to  engage  in  a
             serious criminal enterprise producing cannabis to a  value  of
             ï¿½100,000 and to make money by supplying class  A  drugs.   HHJ
             Mercer's sentencing remarks accepted that  the  appellant  was
             cultivating the drugs for others and he was sentenced on  this
             basis.  (RB 192)."

    As above, the appellant was convicted of  production  of  a  controlled
    drug - Class B - Cannabis and not supply of a Class A drug.

 8. When considering this ground, I took into account that in paragraph  22
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  appear  to  refer  obliquely   to   the
    conviction, mentioning the production of cannabis  and  cultivation  of
    drugs. I also took into account that the FTTJ found that the  appellant
    represented  a  genuine,  present  and  sufficiently   serious   threat
    affecting one of the fundamental interests of society not only  because
    of the criminal offence but because of his immigration history, stating
    in paragraph 27:

         "27.     All the above conduct I find represents a genuine, present
             and  sufficiently  serious  threat  affecting   one   of   the
             fundamental interests of society.  One  of  the  interests  of
             society is preventing unlawful immigration and  abuse  of  the
             immigration laws.  The appellant's conduct has  been  contrary
             to this as well as to the wider  societal  harm  by  his  drug
             offence."

 9. It remained my  view  that  this  aspect  of  the  grounds  had  merit.
    Notwithstanding the reference to aspects  of  the  correct  offence  in
    paragraph 22 of the decision and the  appellant's  immigration  history
    also weighing against him, the decision does disclose a material  error
    of fact which  amounts  to  an  error  of  law.  The  judge  based  the
    assessment of whether the appellant represented a genuine, present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest of the UK  on  an
    incorrect and more serious offence and the nature of the offence was  a
    fundamental aspect in the assessment that  had  to  be  conducted.  The
    assessment of whether  the  appellant  poses  a  genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat to a fundamental interest must therefore be
    set aside to be re-made. As the appellant's criminal history is also  a
    material factor in the proportionality assessment which might also have
    reached a different conclusion had it been based on the correct offence
    of production of Class B drugs, that part of the decision must also  be
    set aside to be remade.

10. The remainder of the grounds had little merit. The judge  set  out  the
    provisions of Regulation 27(5) in the decision and it is not  arguable,
    as maintained in paragraph 13 of the grounds, that the  judge  did  not
    have proper regard  to  those  provisions.   The  judge  addressed  the
    evidence on the wife's medical difficulties lawfully, proceeding on the
    basis   that   she   suffered   "from   several   illnesses   including
    fibromyalgia"; see paragraph 8.  The judge gave  rational  reasons  for
    finding that the appellant's partner could obtain adequate treatment in
    Albania, Spain or Argentina. The judge was not  required  to  find  the
    wife's salary to be a determinative or even significant factor,  having
    accepted in paragraph 35 that she "has a job and is self-supporting."

11. The judge was clearly entitled to place little weight on the report  of
    Jasmine Smith where nothing in the report shows she  has  expertise  or
    experience on criminal or medical matters, for example. The judge  took
    a correct approach in finding that  the  report  was  not  reliable  in
    those, and other, regards. Her report indicated in paragraph 8 that the
    appellant told her that he has two brothers and four sisters in Albania
    so the it is not arguable the judge was in error in  finding  that  the
    appellant has a number of relatives in Albania.

12. It remains the case that the Regulation 27 assessment  of  whether  the
    appellant poses a genuine, present and sufficiently serious risk  to  a
    fundamental interest in the UK and, if  so,  whether  the  decision  to
    refuse a residence card was proportionate,  are  holistic  assessments,
    strongly informed by the  nature  and  seriousness  of  an  appellant's
    criminal offences. It is therefore my conclusion that the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on a point of law such  that
    all of the decision has to be set aside to be re-made  de  novo.  Where
    the re-making must be de novo it is appropriate  for  the  remaking  to
    take place in the First-tier Tribunal in line with paragraph 7 of  Part
    3 of the Senior President's Practice Statement dated 25 September 2012.

Decision

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal discloses an error on  a  point
    of law and is set  aside  to  be  remade  de  novo  by  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.
