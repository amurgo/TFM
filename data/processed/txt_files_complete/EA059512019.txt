                        UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CANAVAN

                                   Between

                                REOLAND MARIN
                                                                   Appellant
                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant appealed the respondent's  decision  dated  11  September
    2019 to refuse to  issue  a  residence  card  recognising  a  right  of
    residence as the family member of an EEA national.

2.   The appeal is brought under regulation 36 of The Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016 ('the EEA Regulations 2016'). The  only
    ground of appeal is whether the decision appealed against breaches  the
    appellant's right under the EU Treaties in respect  of  entry  into  or
    residence in the United Kingdom (paragraph 2(4) Schedule 2).

3.   The recent history of the case is outlined the Upper  Tribunal's  error
    of law decision at [2-3] (annexed), which was promulgated on  16  April
    2021. The Upper Tribunal set aside that  part  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Bartlett's decision relating to the question of whether the EEA sponsor
    is a 'qualified person' for the purpose of  regulation  6  of  the  EEA
    Regulations 2016.

4.   The Upper Tribunal gave the provisional view that  the  decision  could
    be remade without a hearing based on up to date  documentary  evidence.
    It made directions giving the parties the opportunity to object to this
    mode of determination within 7 days of the date the decision was  sent.
    If there was no objection  to  the  decision  being  remade  without  a
    hearing the appellant was to file and serve any up to date evidence and
    written submissions within 14 days of the date the  decision  was  sent
    and the respondent was directed to reply within 28 days.

5.   The appellant complied with the direction by email  on  20  April  2021
    confirming that he had no objection to the decision being remade on the
    papers without a hearing. Up to date evidence was  filed  at  the  same
    time. The email appeared  to  have  been  copied  to  respondent's  'UT
    directions' address and directly to the Senior Presenting  Officer  who
    appeared at the error of law hearing.

6.   The Upper Tribunal has no record of a response to directions  from  the
    respondent. I am satisfied that the error of law decision was  sent  to
    the respondent and that she  appears  to  have  been  served  with  the
    appellant's response to the directions. She has  not  objected  to  the
    decision being remade without a hearing and has not  made  any  further
    submissions in response to the up to  date  evidence  produced  by  the
    appellant. I am satisfied that the respondent has  been  given  a  fair
    opportunity to make further submissions on the mode of hearing and  the
    up to date evidence if she wanted and that I can proceed  to  determine
    the appeal in the absence of a response to directions.

7.   The appellant produced a letter from  his  employer,  Yusuf  Cagin,  of
    Vakkas Limited dated 16 April 2021.  The  letter  gives  his  telephone
    number and email address as well as the business address. He  confirmed
    that the appellant and his wife had been employed by the company  since
    01 July 2020 and that they were both contracted to work 156  hours  per
    month on the minimum wage.  There  is  no  evidence  of  an  employment
    contract for the appellant or the EEA sponsor. A  print  out  from  the
    Companies House website confirms that Mr Cagin is a director of  Vakkas
    Limited. The appellant has also provided copies of payslips covering  a
    period from July 2020 to March 2021. The payslips  contain  information
    relating to the hours and rate of pay that is broadly  consistent  with
    Mr Cagin's letter.  They  are  also  consistent  with  the  appellant's
    previous evidence that they are paid in cash.

8.   A copy of the EEA sponsor's bank statement has also been  produced.  If
    she is paid in cash I would not expect  to  see  direct  payments  from
    Vakkas Limited. However, there are three cash deposits labelled 'Vakkas
    Limited' on 15 September 2020, 05 October 2020 and 09 November 2020 for
    similar amounts to her salary. This may have been an attempt by the EEA
    sponsor to demonstrate that she received the cash  income  she  claimed
    for the First-tier  Tribunal  hearing  on  01  October  2020,  but  the
    statement was not produced at the time and it seems  that  she  stopped
    making cash deposits thereafter.

9.   The final pieces of evidence are P60  certificates  for  the  tax  year
    2020-2021. The P60s indicate that  the  appellant  and  his  wife  both
    earned a gross income of �12,242.88 from  their  employment  at  Vakkas
    Limited in the period from 01 July 2020 to 05 April 2021. The level  of
    income exceeds the Minimum Earnings  Threshold  for  Class  1  National
    Insurance  contributions  and  cannot  be  described  as  marginal   or
    ancillary.

10.  The respondent has  not  made  any  submissions  in  response  to  this
    evidence. No challenge is made to the authenticity  of  the  documents.
    Although there is little evidence of direct receipt of income, I do not
    have to be certain. I only need to be satisfied that it is more  likely
    than not that the EEA sponsor is working in the UK and that her  income
    is 'genuine and effective' and not 'marginal or ancillary': see Levin v
    Staatssecretaris van Justitie Case 53/81 [1982] ECR 1035. On  the  face
    of it, the evidence is sufficient to meet that standard.  I  find  that
    the EEA sponsor is a 'qualified person' with reference to regulation 6.
    For these reasons I conclude that the appeal under the EEA  Regulations
    2016 must be allowed.

11.  It is a matter for the respondent to consider what course of action  to
    take following this decision given that the UK has now exited from  the
    European Union and the EEA sponsor was granted pre-settled status under
    the EU Settlement Scheme on 11 December 2019. The respondent will  also
    need to consider the fact that the appellant entered the UK  in  breach
    of an extant deportation order made under UK law.

The appeal is ALLOWED under the EEA Regulations 2016

Representation:
For the appellant:     Mr T. Nawaz of ACS Visas
For the respondent:    Mr D. Clarke, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellant is an Albanian national  who  appealed  the  respondent's
    decision dated 11 September 2019 to refuse to issue  a  residence  card
    recognising a right of residence as the family of an EEA national.

2.    The  respondent's  summary  of  the  appellant's  immigration  history
    indicates that he claimed to have entered the UK illegally  in  October
    2013. He was served with illegal entry papers on 30 July  2017.  On  25
    January 2018 he was convicted of criminal offences  relating  to  drugs
    and false identify documents and sentenced to three years' imprisonment
    under the name of Reoland Poshnjari. The appellant  was  deported  from
    the UK under the Early Release Scheme on 24 May  2018.  The  respondent
    states that there is a  record  of  the  appellant  landing  at  Dublin
    airport with his EEA national sponsor on 05 February  2019.  The  exact
    date when he re-entered the UK is unclear from the evidence before  me.
    When he did so, he re-entered in breach of the deportation order. On 24
    April 2019 he made an application for a residence card as the spouse of
    an EEA national sponsor.

3.   The respondent refused the application because she  was  not  satisfied
    that there was sufficient evidence to show that the EEA sponsor  was  a
    'qualified person' exercising Treaty Rights in the UK.  The  respondent
    also refused the application on the ground that it was thought to be  a
    marriage of convenience entered into for the purpose  of  circumventing
    the immigration rules. Perhaps because  the  respondent  had  concluded
    that it was a marriage of convenience,  and  she  considered  that  the
    appellant's circumstances did not engage rights under European law, she
    did not make a relevant decision to remove him from the UK  on  grounds
    of  public  policy  under  regulation  27  in  light  of  his  criminal
    convictions and the fact that he was remaining in the UK in breach of a
    deportation order. The appellant's skeleton argument before the  First-
    tier Tribunal stated that he also made an  application  to  revoke  the
    deportation order, which had not been decided.

4.   First-tier Tribunal Judge  J.  Bartlett  ("the  judge")  dismissed  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated on 02 October 2020. She heard evidence
    from the appellant and his wife. She was satisfied  that  the  marriage
    was not one of convenience and gave  reasons  for  her  decision.  This
    aspect of the decision has not been challenged.

5.   The judge went on to find that there was insufficient evidence to  show
    that the EEA sponsor was a 'qualified person' exercising rights of free
    movement in the UK. She noted the reasons given by  the  respondent  in
    the decision letter. She went on to consider further evidence  produced
    by the appellant and made the following findings:

         "9.  After the CMR the appellant  submitted  further  documents  in
             support of his assertion  that  the  sponsor  is  a  qualified
             person. These documents included two employers'  letters,  two
             companies  house  screenshots  relating  to  those  employers,
             payslips and a HMRC letter.

         10.  This HMRC letter sets out  a  record  of  the  sponsors  (sic)
             earnings from the tax year 2016/2017 onwards. The earnings  in
             2016/17 were minimal. However those in 2017/18 were in  excess
             of �12,00 (sic). The earnings in tax year 2018/19  were  again
             minimal under �1,300. The earnings in tax  year  2019/20  were
             just under �8500 which are de minimis. However the HMRC record
             indicates that one of the employers was  Bakur  Limited  which
             correspondence with the name  given  by  the  sponsor  in  the
             application.

         11.  An accountant's  letter  states  that  the  sponsor  commenced
             employment at Vakkas Limited on 01 July 2020 and she works  36
             hours per week earning a gross income of �1360.32.

         12.  Included with the appellant's  application  were  2  payslips,
             bank statements which largely predate the sponsor's  departure
             from the country in 2018 and so far as  they  relate  to  2019
             show substantial deposits from  non-earnings  related  sources
             and only 1 deposit relating to her employment in March 2019.

         13.  For completeness I record that it is unclear from the evidence
             whether  the  sponsor's  employment  with  Samsunlu   Ltd   is
             continuing but in any event as the letter sets  out  that  her
             gross monthly earnings were �355.74 I find  that  this  is  de
             minimis and insufficient to establish that she is a qualifying
             person.

         14.  I am required to consider the situation at  the  time  of  the
             appeal.  I  find  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence   to
             establish that at the date of the  appeal  the  sponsor  is  a
             qualifying  person.  This  is  because  there   is   only   an
             accountant's letter  to  support  the  oral  evidence  of  the
             sponsor and the appellant, there are no payslips and there are
             no bank statements. I recognise that there is  a  letter  from
             the  accountant  of  Vakkas  Limited  and  the  accountant  of
             Samsunlu Ltd. However, given that this issue was  specifically
             raised by the respondent I find that the appellant has  failed
             to establish that the sponsor is a qualifying person."

6.    The  appellant  appealed  the  First-tier  Tribunal  decision  on  the
    following grounds:

      i) The judge failed to take into  account  the  respondent's  guidance
         when assessing whether the sponsor was a 'qualified person' (ground
         1);

     ii) The judge failed to take into account the fact that the sponsor was
         granted 'Pre-settled Status' under the EU Settlement  Scheme.  This
         was said to be "highly relevant since it now no longer requires the
         Sponsor to be a QP" (ground 4).

    iii) The judge failed to take into account relevant facts  and  evidence
         and failed to  apply  the  correct  legal  test  to  the  sponsor's
         earnings (grounds 2, 3 & 5);

Decision and reasons

7.   The first ground, as  drafted,  fails  to  identify  the  name  of  the
    relevant policy that is said to be at the  heart  of  the  argument  Mr
    Nawaz was attempting to make. The ground contains a  web  address,  but
    this only places the burden on the  Upper  Tribunal  to  seek  out  the
    policy when it should be referred to  clearly  in  the  pleadings.  The
    skeleton  arguments  filed  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  referred
    variously to "the HO guidance at Item 26" and "Item 28" but  the  index
    to the bundle only provides further web addresses (in a paper  copy  so
    it is not possible to follow a  hyperlink).  No  paper  copies  of  the
    relevant policies were  included in the bundle  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. An earlier skeleton argument before the  First-tier  Tribunal
    contained a one page annex, which Mr Nawaz referred to as the  relevant
    policy. However, it is not possible to identify from that  single  page
    what policy it is drawn from. All it says at the bottom is "Page 13  of
    65 Published for Home Office staff on 21 February 2020".  The  relevant
    section that Mr Nawaz relied on stated:

         "Workers

         This page tells you how to assess if a European Economic Area (EEA)
         national is a qualified person in the worker category under the
         Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations ("the 2016
         Regulations").

         A worker is an EEA national who is exercising their free movement
         rights in the UK by working in paid employment on a full-time or
         part-time basis.

         Evidence of this may include:

       . payslips dated no more than 6 weeks before the application was made

       . a letter from the employer confirming employment

       . a contract of employment"

8.   First, the ground is so vague and the reference to  the  guidance  made
    so  difficult  that  the  appellant's  representative  has   not   even
    identified the relevant policy with any  clarity.  Second,  the  policy
    only gives guidance to  Home  Office  caseworkers  about  the  kind  of
    evidence that might show that an EEA national is exercising  rights  of
    free movement in the UK. It does not purport  to  be  a  set  of  rules
    whereby a residence card will be  issued  on  the  basis  of  specified
    evidence. Whether EU law is  engaged  will  depend  on  the  facts  and
    evidence in each case. Third, even then the guidance is only couched in
    general terms giving examples of evidence that "may" demonstrate that a
    person is exercising rights of free movement. Nothing  in  the  policy,
    whatever it may be, would make any difference to the  task  the  First-
    tier Tribunal judge was asked to carry out, which was to  evaluate  the
    evidence before her and to decide  for  herself  whether  the  evidence
    showed on the balance of probabilities  that  the  EEA  sponsor  was  a
    'qualified person' at the date of the hearing.

9.   The point about Pre-Settled Status (PSS) is even  more  poorly  pleaded
    and is wholly misconceived. The ground makes a bare assertion that  the
    grant of PSS was "highly relevant since it now no longer  requires  the
    Sponsor to be a QP"  without  even  attempting  to  develop  a  legally
    justifiable argument. I can see no  reference  to  this  point  in  the
    skeleton argument before the First-tier Tribunal. The  judge  does  not
    refer to the argument being put forward by Mr Nawaz at the hearing.  In
    any event, this ground discloses a fundamental misunderstanding of  the
    nature of the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal and the distinction
    between European law and UK immigration law.

10.  The appeal is brought under regulation 36 of The Immigration  (European
    Economic Area) Regulations 2016. The only ground of appeal  is  whether
    the decision appealed against breaches the appellant's right under  the
    EU Treaties in respect of entry into or residence in the United Kingdom
    (paragraph 2(4) Schedule 2). The appeal is only concerned  with  rights
    under EU law.

11.  The EU Settlement Scheme was introduced as a mechanism to  grant  those
    with EU rights of residence leave to remain after the  UK  exited  from
    the EU. It is contained in the immigration rules  and  is  therefore  a
    mechanism of UK  law.  Many  EU  citizens  exercising  rights  of  free
    movement in the UK may have been granted leave to remain under  UK  law
    before the exit date but would still have rights of residence under  EU
    law until that date. The  EU  Settlement  Scheme  did  not  replace  or
    extinguish EU rights of residence while the UK was still  a  member  of
    the EU. Under EU law, an  EEA  national  must  show  that  they  are  a
    'qualified person' who is exercising rights of free movement. The  only
    time when an EEA national does not need to demonstrate  that  they  are
    continuing to exercise treaty rights is when they have acquired a right
    of permanent residence after having exercised rights of  free  movement
    for a continuous period of five years.

12.  I have already found that this ground does nothing  more  than  make  a
    bare and unsubstantiated statement. At the hearing, Mr  Nawaz  repeated
    the assertion, adding that an EEA national just needed to  be  resident
    here and that there is no requirement to show a particular  income.  If
    those are the requirements of the  EU  Settlement  Scheme,  that  is  a
    matter of UK law. The First-tier  Tribunal  was  required  to  consider
    whether the appellant met the requirements of EU law.  The  appellant's
    wife had not acquired a right of permanent residence and was  therefore
    required to demonstrate that she  was  a  'qualified  person'  for  the
    purpose of regulation 6 of the EEA Regulations 2016. The fact that  the
    appellant's wife was granted limited leave to remain under  UK  law  in
    preparation for the UK's  exit  from  the  EU  was  immaterial  to  the
    assessment. The fact that the judge did not refer to the grant of leave
    to remain could not possibly amount to an error of law.

13.  However, there is merit to the final points made in the  grounds  about
    the way in which the  judge  assessed  the  evidence  relating  to  the
    sponsor's income. ACS Visas prepared a bundle for the  initial  hearing
    before the First-tier Tribunal listed in March 2020.  The  hearing  was
    adjourned, but despite the fact that they should have  known  that  the
    evidence would need to be assessed  at  the  date  of  the  hearing  in
    October 2020,  the  evidence  in  the  supplementary  bundle  was  very
    limited. Mr Nawaz treated the hearing before the Upper  Tribunal  as  a
    further opportunity to make good the gaps in the evidence identified by
    the First-tier Tribunal by attempting to file a further large unindexed
    and unpaginated bundle of documents on the morning of the  hearing.  In
    assessing whether the First-tier Tribunal involved  the  making  of  an
    error of law, the Upper Tribunal will only consider the evidence as  it
    stood at the date of the First-tier Tribunal hearing. Documents such as
    the sponsor's bank statements and  payslips  for  her  work  at  Vakkas
    Limited from July to September 2020 could and should have been produced
    for the First-tier Tribunal hearing.

14.  Nevertheless, it is apparent that the judge  conducted  her  assessment
    without applying the correct  test.  While  noting  that  the  evidence
    showed that the sponsor earned a low level of income in some years, she
    twice dismissed her  income  as  "de  minimis".  The  judge  failed  to
    consider the fact that part-time work can still engage rights  of  free
    movement. The sponsor's income of around �8,500 for the last  tax  year
    before the date  of  the  appeal  (2019/2020)  could  not  properly  be
    described as de minimus  when  it  exceeded  the  respondent's  Minimum
    Earnings  Threshold  for  Class  1  National  Insurance   contributions
    (�149pw/�7,748pa). The correct test is whether the work is 'genuine and
    effective'   and   not   'marginal   or   ancillary':   see   Levin   v
    Staatssecretaris van Justitie Case 53/81 [1982] ECR 1035.

15.  As I have already noted,  the  evidence  produced  for  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing  of  the  sponsor's  employment  with  Vakkas  Limited
    omitted documents that should have been available. There  was  evidence
    from HMRC of ongoing earnings sufficient to show that the  sponsor  was
    exercising rights of free  movement  during  the  tax  year  2019/2020.
    However, the appellant was required to show that his wife continued  to
    be a 'qualified person' at the date of the hearing  six  months  later.
    The sponsor's oral evidence was that she  was  working  for  a  company
    called Vakkas Limited. There was some evidence from  a  company  called
    Payroll As You Go, which  purported  to  be  the  accountants  for  her
    employer, confirming that she started employment on 01 July 2020. There
    was no evidence directly from Vakkas Ltd.  Although  the  evidence  was
    thin, it cannot be said that the judge was bound to come  to  the  same
    conclusion if she had applied the correct test.

16.  I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision  involved  the  making
    of an error on a point of law. The decision is set aside. The  findings
    relating to the appellant's marriage are preserved. Those  relating  to
    the assessment of the sponsor's status as  a  'qualified  person'  will
    need to be remade.

DIRECTIONS

17.  The normal course of action is for the Upper  Tribunal  to  remake  the
    decision. My provisional view is that  the  decision  relating  to  the
    sponsor's status as a 'qualified person'  could  be  remade  without  a
    hearing on the basis of any up to date documentary evidence and written
    submissions put forward by the parties.

18.  If there is an  objection  to  the  decision  being  remade  without  a
    hearing, the parties must file and serve written representations within
    7 days of the date this decision is sent, giving reasons as to  why  it
    is thought necessary to have a hearing, and if it is necessary, whether
    it can be done by way of a remote video hearing or needs to be  a  face
    to face hearing.

    NB: Bearing in mind the continued need to take precautions  to  prevent
    the spread of Covid-19 the  Upper  Tribunal  will  generally  expect  a
    hearing  to  be  conducted  remotely  if  witnesses  do  not  need  the
    assistance of an interpreter, but may list a case for a  face  to  face
    hearing if an interpreter is required.

19.  On receipt of any representations  relating  to  mode  of  hearing  the
    Upper Tribunal will review  the  file  and  make  any  case  management
    decisions it deems appropriate.

20.  If there is no  objection  to  the  decision  being  remade  without  a
    hearing, the parties must comply with the following directions:

      i) The appellant shall file and serve any  up  to  date  evidence  and
         written submissions relating to remaking within 14 days of the date
         this decision is sent.

     ii) The respondent shall file and serve any up  to  date  evidence  and
         written submissions relating to remaking within 28 days of the date
         this decision is sent.

    iii) The appellant shall file and serve any response within 35  days  of
         the date this decision is sent.

21.  On receipt of further written submissions from both parties  the  Upper
    Tribunal will remake the decision and determine the appeal.

22.  The parties are at liberty to apply to amend these  directions,  giving
    reasons, if they face significant practical difficulties in complying.

23.  Documents or submissions filed in response to these directions  may  be
    sent      by,      or      attached      to,      an      email      to
    FieldHouseCorrespondence@Justice.gov.uk using the Tribunal's  reference
    number (found at the top of these  directions)  as  the  subject  line.
    Attachments must not exceed 15 MB.

24.     Service    on    the    Secretary    of    State    may    be     to
    UTdirections@homeoffice.gov.uk and to the original  appellant,  in  the
    absence of any contrary instruction, by use  of  any  address  apparent
    from the service of these directions.
