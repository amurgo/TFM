Mr MM Saleem (solicitor, Malik & Malik) for the appellant
Mr A Sheikh for the respondent

                             DECISION ON APPEAL

   This is an appeal from a decision of an adjudicator (Mr AW  Palmer  QC),
   sitting at Birmingham on 22 October 2003, dismissing an asylum and human
   rights appeal by a Hindu citizen of Afghanistan.  Permission  to  appeal
   was given on the basis of grounds of appeal arguing that  there  was  no
   effective protection for Hindus, even in Kabul; and  that  it  would  be
   contrary to article 8 of the Human Rights  Convention  to  separate  the
   claimant from his father, who has exceptional leave to remain here  till
   2005.

2. We had better say at once that we regard the article 8 grounds as wholly
   without merit. There is nothing in  a  grant  of  exceptional  leave  to
   remain to show that the subject cannot return to his country of  origin:
   it is what it says it is, exceptional. If the claimant's father had been
   dissatisfied with the status afforded him by the  leave  he  was  given,
   then it would have been quite open to him to appeal that decision, under
   � 69.3 of the 1999 Act; but he chose not to do so. The claimant's father
   is of course a good deal older than he is, and has a bad leg  (there  is
   no more precise medical evidence); but there is  nothing  to  show  that
   either he or the claimant himself would be subject in Kabul to  anything
   more than the difficulties common to all Hindus.


3. The question for us is whether these raise any real risk  of  Convention
   persecution or ill-treatment on return. We  were  not  referred  to  any
   previous decisions of the Tribunal on Afghan Hindus, and it may be  that
   there are none. However  we  were  referred  to  [2003]  UKIAT  00057  K
   (Afghanistan), an exhaustive treatment of the situation of Afghan  Sikhs
   by Gill VP and a lay member. Mr Saleem was inclined  to  criticize  this
   adjudicator  for  not  making  a  difference  between  this   claimant's
   situation and that facing Sikhs; but it  is  perfectly  clear  that  the
   adjudicator realized he was dealing with a Hindu, and there  is  nothing
   to show that he simply assumed that they faced  the  same  situation  as
   Sikhs.

4. On the other hand, the CIPU report (October 2003) says at � 6.51:

   Unlike their  counterparts  in  India,  where  the  faiths  are  clearly
   separate it is reported that Sikhs and Hindus, in  predominantly  Muslim
   Afghanistan, have become  united  in  adversity.  They  share  the  same
   temples as well as many religious ceremonies.

   On the evidence before us, we see no basis for  making  any  distinction
   between the situation of the Sikhs and that of  the  Hindus.  Mr  Saleem
   suggested that the latter might be  less  welcome  than  the  former  in
   gurdwaras, the Sikh temples which according to him formed the main place
   of refuge for members of both communities.

5. In fact � 6.53 refers to those returned to Afghanistan taking refuge  in
   "Daramsals" (sc. Dharamsala), which there is nothing to suggest has  any
   specifically Sikh connotations. However, even if this claimant  and  his
   wife did have to go to a gurdwara on return, Mr  Saleem  was  unable  to
   challenge our understanding of the traditional duty of those  in  charge
   of such  places  to  give  shelter  and  accommodation  to  all  comers,
   regardless of religion. He was in the end reduced  to  arguing  that  it
   would be contrary to the human rights of the claimant and his spouse  to
   require them to live for any length of time in  an  establishment  which
   might not afford the  necessary  privacy  for  marital  relations.  Such
   experience as we have of human nature suggests that, where  there  is  a
   will, there is a way; but in any case, there is nothing whatever to show
   that those in charge of gurdwaras are so unsympathetic that  they  would
   not, for example, let a blanket be draped across some convenient  alcove
   when required.

6. Mr Saleem raised a general point about the safety of Kabul, in  view  of
   the deficiencies in the police force noted by Amnesty  International  in
   their press release "Afghanistan:  Policing  to  protect  human  rights"
   (undated, but  with  a  2003  reference  number,  down-loaded  from  the
   Internet on 14 June 2003). That raises general problems, not related  to
   the Hindu (or Sikh) communities, which are said to have led  to  general
   loss of public confidence in  the  police.  However,  there  is  nothing
   specifically  relating  to  Kabul  in  the  release,   except   for   an
   acknowledgement that it is the only place where the  central  government
   has effective control.

7. On the  other  hand,  Mr  Sheikh  referred  us  to  material  which  did
   specifically relate to the security situation in Kabul, in  the  October
   2003  CIPU  report.  ISAF  [International  Security  Assistance   Force]
   reported (� 5.56) in April 2002 that it had significantly improved since
   they arrived and (� 5.63) a further vast improvement during  the  period
   November 2002 - February 2003); a Danish  fact-finding  mission  in  May
   2002(� 5.57) had said security was  generally  good,  apart  from  three
   named districts (not shown to be of any  particular  relevance  to  this
   case). The Secretary-General of the United Nations had reported "a  very
   positive impact on security" by ISAF in Kabul in July  2002,  expressing
   still more favourable views (including the effect on public  confidence)
   in July 2003, again so far as the capital was concerned.

8. We regard 57 K  as  an  entirely  balanced  assessment  of  the  general
   situation, and that facing Sikhs in Kabul. As the Tribunal in that  case
   pointed out (� 15.1), the general humanitarian  situation  in  Kabul  is
   still very poor by Western standards;  but  that  is  not  the  test  of
   "inhuman or degrading treatment" contrary to  article  3  of  the  Human
   Rights Convention. Mr Saleem suggested that K, as a woman  on  her  own,
   might have expected to be better looked after by the community on return
   than this claimant.

9. On the other hand, this claimant, as a man (and  one  whose  history  of
   escape showed him as resourceful in both senses), would be  better  able
   to look after himself. There is nothing to show  that  paying  for  that
   exhausted not only the proceeds of the family house, but also their shop
   and all of its stock (see claimant's statement 2 May 2003, � 8); or that
   the claimant (or his father)  would  after  an  extended  stay  in  this
   country be completely without money on return to Afghanistan; but,  even
   if they did have to take refuge in a temple to begin  with,  we  see  no
   reason, for the reasons we have already given, why that should amount to
   "inhuman or degrading treatment".
