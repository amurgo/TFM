                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant in these proceedings is the Secretary of  State  but  for
    convenience I refer to the parties as they were before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal.

 2. On 17th January 2013 the appellant,  a  citizen  of  Nepal  born  on  6
    October 1988, applied for entry clearance to join his family in the  UK
    for the purposes of settlement.  That  application  was  refused  in  a
    decision dated 7th May 2013.  It was said in the decision  notice  that
    the appellant was not able to meet the requirements of the  Immigration
    Rules and in fact so much is accepted on behalf of the appellant.  What
    those requirements are I do not need to elaborate in this decision.

 3. The appeal came before First-tier Judge  Lobo  at  a  hearing  on  20th
    December 2013.  In a decision promulgated on 16th January  2014,  Judge
    Lobo allowed the appeal on human rights  grounds.   He  allowed  it  on
    human rights grounds  because  he  was  aware  of  the  fact  that  the
    appellant could  not  succeed  under  the  Immigration  Rules  and  the
    Immigration Rules in relation to family life  were  not  argued  before
    him.

 4. The judge heard evidence from the appellant's mother, Mrs S  M  Tamang,
    and she was the only witness who was called to give evidence.   Amongst
    the evidence that she gave was that if the present law in  relation  to
    the settlement of Gurkhas and families had existed before her husband's
    death, and he died in 2008, and after his retirement, her husband would
    have applied to enter the United Kingdom with herself and  their  three
    children including the appellant.

 5. She also gave evidence that of her three children  only  the  appellant
    remained in Nepal.  He did not apply for entry at the same time as  the
    sponsor, that is his mother  who  is  the  witness,  and  her  children
    because she had placed him  in  a  drug  rehabilitation  unit  for  his
    addiction to drugs.  Her  evidence  was  also  that  the  appellant  is
    financially dependent on her and that  she  sends  money  regularly  to
    Nepal where he lives in his mother's house.  Her evidence was  that  he
    is emotionally dependent on her and his siblings as  a  consequence  of
    his father spending much time away on military service.

 6. The early death of his father also led to drug abuse and  her  evidence
    was that she earned sufficient income to  allow  her  to  maintain  and
    support her family in the UK, to send money to  the  appellant  and  to
    provide for accommodation for him and the other children.

 7. At para 28, the judge made certain findings of fact.  They go from sub-
    para (a) to sub-para (p).  It is not  necessary  in  this  judgment  to
    refer to all the findings made by the judge but he concluded  that  the
    appellant's father was a Gurkha serving in the British Army who died in
    2008.  He concluded at 28(d) that had the appellant's  father  survived
    he would have applied for settlement with his wife and three  children,
    including the appellant, and at sub-para (e), but for the denial of the
    opportunity  to  apply,  the  appellant's  father  would  qualify   for
    settlement at the time of his discharge.  He went on to find  that  the
    appellant himself would therefore have qualified for  settlement  under
    certain paragraphs of the Immigration Rules.

 8. He accepted the evidence of the appellant's mother that she had put him
    in a drug rehabilitation unit to help him overcome substance misuse and
    that he is no longer dependent on drugs according to  his  mother,  who
    the judge found at sub-para (j) to be a credible witness.  At  sub-para
    (l) it was found that the appellant is  financially  dependent  on  his
    mother who sends various amounts on a regular basis The judge  referred
    to money transfers receipts produced at the  hearing  to  the  tune  of
    about ï¿½6,450 covering a period of "1 December 2012 to 19 October 2012",
    although those dates as written do not appear to be  correct,  and  the
    money transfer receipts on the Tribunal file cover a period from  about
    May to December 2013. However, nothing turns on this it seems to me.

 9. At sub-para (m) the judge found that although the appellant is 25 years
    of age and in good health, he is reliant on his mother and siblings for
    a number of reasons and he gave those reasons as follows.  His reliance
    is a consequence of his own personality.  Secondly, the fact that as  a
    family they all became reliant upon each other when  their  father  was
    away on active service.  He found that Gurkhas serve  or  served  under
    more restrictive terms of service which allowed less  time  with  their
    families.

10. Then he found that the appellant's drug addiction and the help  of  his
    mother and family helped him to overcome the problem and he also  found
    that his younger sister looks after him in Nepal even  though  she  has
    leave to settle in the UK.  He,  at  least  implicitly,  made  findings
    about the ability of the appellant's mother to maintain and accommodate
    the appellant.

11. It is said in the grounds of appeal to the Upper  Tribunal  that  there
    was insufficient basis  for  the  judge  to  have  concluded  that  the
    appellant's father intended to apply for settlement prior to his  death
    in 2008.

12. That proposition is not correct, given the findings of  the  First-tier
    judge that I have already referred to.  There  was  evidence  from  the
    appellant's mother that such an application for settlement  would  have
    been made had the  father  had  the  opportunity  to  do  so  and  that
    application would have  included  the  appellant.  As  I  have  already
    indicated, the judge found the evidence of the appellant's mother to be
    credible.

13. The judge went on to find  that  there  was  family  life  between  the
    appellant and his family in the UK.  At para 32(c), he  said  that  the
    appellant continues to reside in  the  family  home  and  has  not  yet
    established an independent life, at sub-para (d) that he is financially
    dependent on the sponsor, and at (e) that he, his mother  and  siblings
    are a close family unit.

14. He referred to cultural factors to be taken into account and  concluded
    that the prolonged separation due to  service  and  economic  necessity
    further strengthened the present bond,  and  he  went  on  to  conclude
    therefore that there was family life established.

15. The grounds of appeal challenge the judge's conclusions that  there  is
    established family life.  In further submissions  before  me,  Mr  Nath
    relied on the decision in AAO [2011] EWCA Civ 840 to  the  effect  that
    financial dependence would not be sufficient to establish family  life.
    However, the judge did not  conclude  that  there  was  only  financial
    dependence.   As  I  have  already  indicated  with  reference  to  the
    determination, there are a number of factors that the judge  took  into
    account in finding that family life does exist.

16. It is said that the judge did not take into account relevant authority.
    One of the cases cited  in  support  of  that  proposition  is  Gulshan
    (Article 8-new rules-correct approach) Pakistan [2013] UKUT 640  (IAC).
    Mr Nath took me to various passages of that decision,  suggesting  that
    the judge did not adopt the  correct  approach  in  the  assessment  of
    Article 8 with reference to the new Rules.

17. It is true to say that the  judge  did  not  refer  to  every  relevant
    authority that could possibly be cited in the appeal, although  in  the
    case of Gulshan, it was only promulgated three days before the  hearing
    of this appeal in the First-tier  Tribunal.    Nagre  [2013]  EWHC  720
    (Admin) is also of potential relevance, although it being a decision of
    the Administrative Court it has taken time for its significance  to  be
    understood.

18. However, the First-tier judge did  have  regard  to  a  wide  range  of
    authority. Contrary to what is suggested in the grounds, I am satisfied
    that he did take into account the relevance of the Immigration Rules in
    the assessment of proportionality.  He referred to the need for  a  two
    stage test, having a separate sub-para in that regard, starting at para
    16, and referred to the decision in MF (Article 8 - new rules)  Nigeria
    [2012] UKUT 00393(IAC) and the Court of Appeal  decision  in  the  same
    case (MF [2013] EWCA Civ 1192).

19. At para 30 of the determination he referred to the Article 8 assessment
    requiring a two stage process, and that the Article  8  claim  must  be
    considered against the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,  stating
    that in the context of this appeal that means Annex FM.  He went on  to
    state that "If the appellant fails to meet those requirements then  the
    claim must be considered against the ECHR".  At para 31 he said that it
    was common ground that the appellant does not meet the requirements  of
    the Immigration Rules and therefore he had to move on to  consider  the
    ECHR.

20.  It  is  true  that  under  the  sub-heading   "Is   the   Interference
    Proportionate?" the judge did not go on again to refer to the decisions
    in MF, but I am satisfied that he had sufficiently in mind  the  public
    interest as reflected in the Immigration Rules. This  is  evident  when
    one reads the determination as a whole.  It seems to me to  be  crucial
    that the judge concluded that, but  for  the  historic  injustice,  the
    appellant would have had an application  for  settlement  made  on  his
    behalf by his father.  As I say, that was a conclusive finding  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal.

21. This is relevant particularly because of  two  decisions:  one  of  the
    Court of Appeal in Gurung [2013] EWCA Civ 8 and secondly a decision  of
    the Upper Tribunal in  Ghising  and  others  (Ghurkhas/BOC's:  historic
    wrong; weight) [2013] UKUT 567 (IAC).

22. In the latter decision, the Upper Tribunal said at para  59  that  they
    accepted the submission that where Article 8 is held to be engaged  and
    the fact that but for the historic wrong the appellant would have  been
    settled in the UK  long  ago  is  established,  "this  will  ordinarily
    determine the outcome of the proportionality assessment; and  determine
    it in an Appellant's favour".

23. The Upper Tribunal went on to say (para 60) that being an  adult  child
    of a UK settled Gurkha ex-serviceman is not a trump card in  the  sense
    that not every application by such a person  will  inevitably  succeed;
    but if the respondent is relying upon the public interest as  described
    by the Court of Appeal at para 41 of Gurung,  then  the  weight  to  be
    given to the historic injustice will normally require a decision in the
    appellant's favour.

24. In this appeal, there  was,  and  is,  nothing  to  indicate  that  the
    respondent relies on anything other than the interests  of  immigration
    control on the public interest side of  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise. Sometimes there may be other matters relied on,  for  example
    criminality, or a bad immigration history, that  may  militate  against
    the proportionality assessment in favour of the  appellant.  As  I  say
    however, no such matters are relied on in this case.

25. When one sees the determination in its proper context,  considering  it
    as a whole, I am satisfied that the judge came to  his  conclusions  in
    accordance  with  relevant  authority  and  undertook  a   satisfactory
    proportionality assessment, taking into  account  all  relevant  facts.
    Whilst the judge could have, under the sub-heading of  proportionality,
    repeated all the matters that he had previously  made  findings  about,
    looking at the determination as a coherent whole  I  am  not  satisfied
    that  that  would  have  been  a  necessary  step  for  him  to   take,
    particularly when he had concluded, crucially, that an application  for
    settlement would have been made earlier by the appellant's father.

26. In these circumstances, I am not satisfied that there is any  error  of
    law in the First-tier Judge's decision and therefore  the  decision  to
    allow the appeal under Article 8 of the ECHR is to stand.
