                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS




     1. This is an appeal against a determination of a panel of the  First-
        tier Tribunal composed of First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer and  Mrs
        S.A. Hussain JP (hereinafter referred to as 'the Panel') who  in  a
        determination promulgated on the 22nd October  2012  dismissed  the
        appeal against  a  deportation  order  dated  7th  June  2012  made
        pursuant to section 32(5) UK Borders Act 2007.


     2. Permission to appeal was granted on a renewed  application  to  the
        Upper Tribunal on 20th December 2012.



Background


     3. SA was born oin the 12th April 1968 and is a national of  Pakistan.
        He has a British wife and three children who we shall refer  to  as
        S, born in 2002, A, born in 2004, and H who was born in  2009.  The
        children are British citizens too.


     4. SA was convicted on 21st August  2009  at  Leicester  Crown  Court,
        after trial, of conspiracy to supply  cannabis  for  which  he  was
        sentenced to a total of six years in prison on 11th December  2009.
        In his sentencing remarks HHJ Wide QC stated:


              SA, you are forty one.  You  were  convicted  after  trial  of
   involvement  in                this   cannabis   factory.    It   was   a
   substantial, quite sophisticated, commercial           operation, growing
   drugs for profit. There were two rooms at the premises               that
   were set up for cannabis production.  So far as the first  is  concerned,
     the calculation is that it would  produce  something  like  �11-�15,000
   worth          of cannabis every eight months,  which  his  something  in
   excess of �65,-                  �90,000 worth a year.


              The drugs that were taken out of the  second  room  -  on  the
   operation that               took place, after the burglary - were  worth
   something like �6-�8,000, from            one crop. That means that  this
   factory would have the  capacity,  well  in            excess  of  around
   �100,000 a year mark. Quite sophisticated, commercial,                for
   profit.


              You were very high in the pecking order - there may have  been
   someone             higher than you, but  you  were  plainly  in  a  high
   managerial position.  With            your apparent  respectability,  you
   were in effect  a  "front  man",  and  you               were  very  much
   involved   with   the   renting   of    the    premises,    with    their
   adaptations: so high up but not at the very top.


     5. For what was his first  offence  SA  was  sentenced  to  six  years
        imprisonment on each of the two countsry concurrently.


     6. SA relied upon two exceptions to be found in the 2007  Act,  namely
        that his deportations will breach  his  rights  under  the  Refugee
        Convention and the Human Rights Act.


     7. Having considered the evidence the Panel set out their its findings
        from paragraph 39 of the determination, the key elements  of  which
        can be summarised as follows:


          i.  SA is presumed to constitute a danger to the community  having
   been            convicted  in  the  United  Kingdom  of  an  offence  and
   sentenced to a period            of imprisonment of at least  2  years  -
   section 72 Nationality, Immigration           and Asylum Act 2002. [40]


          ii. SA's claim he was an army cadet and received  training  as  an
   engineer is             accepted but despite  being  in  touch  with  his
   family in Pakistan and having             seen them and  having  produced
   evidence  from  Pakistan,  he  has  provided             no   documentary
   evidence of having joined the army. [41]


          iii.    SA's was telling to truth when he said he trained in Italy
   but was told after           his training there was no work for  him.  It
   is not accepted  it  is  reasonably               likely  he  would  have
   returned to Pakistan in 1998 or 2007 if he had                   concerns
   about  his  personal  safety.   In  2007  he  travelled  using  his   own
   passport  issued  by  the  Pakistani  authorities.    If   the   Pakistan
   authorities             had any interest in SA they would  have  detained
   him on return. It was            not  accepted  that  he  was  in  hiding
   during his time in Pakistan. [42]


          iv. It is not accepted SA is  a  military  deserter  or  would  be
   perceived as such.           He fabricated the claim to be in fear of the
   authorities and he came to the            UK to  work.  [43]  The  claims
   under Articles 2 and 3  ECHR  were  dismissed              for  the  same
   reason. [44]


          v.  The children's best interests must be considered as a  primary
                  consideration. [45]


          vi. Prior to his imprisonment SA was living with  his  family  and
   involved in             normal day-to day care.   He  maintained  contact
   with them whilst he was               in prison and they visited him.  He
   was an exemplary prisoner. [47]


          vii.    There is no reason to doubt the close nature of the family
   relationship. It is              accepted that the children  will  suffer
   emotional harm if SA is deported.             The family and professional
   support noted as being available to the family              whilst SA was
   in    prison    can    continue,    which    given    the    number    of
   testimonials is extensive. [48]


          viii.   It is not in the children's  best  interests  to  live  in
   Pakistan and not                 appropriate for SA's  wife  to  move  to
   Pakistan. [49]


          ix.  The  children  will  struggle  to  understand  why  they  are
   separated from               their father  and  their  mother  will  have
   difficulty being able to re-assure            them although she will have
   access  to  professional  support.  The                 consequences  for
   foreign nationals committing serious offences  and  being               a
   danger to the public is that they may be deported. [49]


          x.  SA's removal will not prove critical to the family unit  in  a
   tangible sense as            he damaged the fabric of the family  through
   his offending and they have            survived  that  trauma  for  three
   years already. [50]


          xi. For the older children it will be a profound and  truly  awful
   event and one           which they will never be able to forget. Children
   who lose a parent are            likely to need help to recover  but  can
   be helped through that process by             the  remaining  parent  and
   professional support which  in  this  case  is  given             by  the
   extensive number of testimonials. [50]


          xii.    It has not been established that  the  deportation  of  SA
   will  remove                   permanently  any  sense  of  security  and
   contentment the children retain           and undermine the  relationship
   with their mother. With a proper                   explanation  for  SA's
   actions it is not reasonably likely  they  will  blame              their
   mother for their loss. [51]


          xiii.     SA is a danger to the community given the length of  his
   sentence and            minimisation of his role. He has twice  shown  no
   regard for immigration           laws by using false  documents.  He  has
   been convicted of a serious drug              offence.  There  remains  a
   risk of re-offending and harm being significant              albeit  that
   both  are  categorised  as  low.  He  has   not   had   the   chance   to
   commit further offences as he  remains  in  custody  and  has  undertaken
   courses seen as being useful. [52]


          xiv.    It is necessary in a democratic society to  deport  SA  to
   prevent crime and            disorder as there is a propensity to  offend
   and  his  convictions,  his                   caution,  his  failure   to
   acknowledge his guilt, and his abuse of immigration              control.
   [54]


          xv. The decision  to  deport  is  proportionate.  The  family  can
   maintain contact             by visits and indirect means.  Although  not
   ideal this is not dissimilar to           the structured contact that has
   occurred over the last three years and is a            direct consequence
   of his offending. [54]


          xvi.    SA will have extensive support in Pakistan. [55]


             xvii.    Having considered the criteria  set  out  in  Uner  v
             Netherlands[2007] Imm AR 303; that                on balance it
             is in the best interests of  the  children  to  live  with  the
             appellant              despite his offending behaviour but  not
             in Pakistan, but given his               bbehaviour this family
             should  be  separated  and  maintain   their   links   in   the
             manner identified. [56 (1) to (8)]



Discussion



     8. Miss Mair challenged the determination on  two  main  grounds.  The
        first relates to SA's claim for asylum.  In the  determination  the
        Panel refers to the provisions of section 72 of the 2002 Act.  This
        section applies for the purpose of the construction and application
        of  Article  33(2)  of  the  Refugee  Convention  (exclusion   from
        protection)  but  the  Panel  made  no  finding  on   whether   the
        presumption is rebutted on the evidence. We would find it  is  not.
        Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention provides that  the  benefit
        of Article 33(1): "May not, however, be claimed by a  refugee  whom
        there are reasonable grounds for  regarding  as  a  danger  to  the
        security of the country  in  which  he  is,  or  who,  having  been
        convicted by a final judgment  of  a  particularly  serious  crime,
        constitutes a danger to the community of that country."


     9. There is no section 72 certificate in the refusal  letter  although
        in SSHD v TB [2008] EWCA Civ 977 the Court of Appeal made it  clear
        that the presumptions apply irrespective of whether the certificate
        is  issued.   Once  the  facts  giving  rise   to   the   statutory
        presumptions have been established it would be an error of law  for
        an immigration judge to fail to apply the presumption  required  by
        the section.


    10. The Panel may not have though it necessary to consider the  section
        72 issue further as their its finding in relation to  this  element
        of the appeal is set out at paragraph 43 of  the  determination  in
        the following terms:


              43.  We  do  not  therefore  accept  that  the  Appellant  has
   established it is                 reasonably  likely  he  is  a  military
   deserter or would be perceived as                  such. We are satisfied
   that he has fabricated the claim  to  be  in  fear  of                the
   authorities and that he simply came here for work.


    11. Miss Mair submitted this finding is flawed as the Panel  failed  to
        provide any or adequate reasons for their its finding the appellant
        fabricated the claim. It is alleged such a finding  is  conjecture.
        There is reference to the acceptance by the Panel of the  fact  the
        appellant was an army cadet and trained as an engineer in the  army
        but did not take up a position and so it is plausible he is at risk
        as alleged.


    12. Had the Panel  only  made  a  bare  statement  that  the  claim  is
        fabricated, and no more, there may have been merit in  this  ground
        but they it did not. The core of the claim for asylum is based upon
        the appellants desire to avoid having to return to military service
        as he claims he became disillusioned with the Pakistan Army and the
        power it exercised and so absconded to work in Saudi Arabia in 1996
        for two years after which he trained in Italy.  The Panel noted the
        appellant returned to Pakistan in 1998 and again in 2007 and  found
        it not reasonably likely he would have returned to Pakistan  if  he
        had the slightest concerns about his personal safety. They It noted
        the  trip  in  2007  was  made  using  a  passport  issued  by  the
        authorities and found if there  was  any  interest  in  him  it  is
        reasonably likely  the  authorities  would  have  detained  him  on
        arrival. The appellant's claim to have remained  in  hiding  during
        the two visits was rejected.


    13. We find it was open to the Panel to find that the appellant  failed
        to substantiate his claim for asylum on the facts of this case.   A
        refugee is defined in Regulation 2 of the Protection Regulations as
        a person who falls within Article  1A  of  the  Gen�ve  Convention,
        namely a  person  who  owing  to  a  well  founded  fear  of  being
        persecuted for reasons of race,  religion,  nationality,  political
        opinion or membership  of a particular social group, is outside the
        country of  nationality and is unable or, owing to  such  fear,  is
        unwilling to avail himself or herself of  the  protection  of  that
        country, or a stateless person, who, being outside of  the  country
        of former habitual residence for  the  same  reasons  as  mentioned
        above, is unable or, owing to such fear, unwilling to return to it,
        and to whom Regulation 7 does not apply.   The  act  of  making  an
        application for a passport to those he claims to be in fear of,  in
        which he would have had to provide a  number  of  relevant  details
        including his address and location, and actually returning  to  the
        Pakistan for a family visit whilst claiming he is unable to  return
        there due to a well founded fear of persecution  is  contradictory.
        We find adequate reasons were  given  to  allow  a  reader  of  the
        determination to understand why the claim was rejected and that  no
        material error of law is proved.


    14. The second head of challenge is to the Panel's findings in relation
        to Article 8 ECHR and in particular their  its  assessment  of  the
        best interests of the children. Miss Mair referred to the fact  the
        Panel accepted the important role the appellant played in the lives
        of his children  which  was  underpinned  by  the  evidence  of  an
        independent social worker, Christine Brown.


    15. We note that in paragraph 45 of the determination the Panel set out
        the correct test, namely that they are  required  to  consider  the
        best interests of the children as their its primary  consideration.
        We reject the submission they it failed to do so as  it  was  found
        that the best interests are that the children be permitted to  live
        with the appellant and their mother which  is  in  accordance  with
        Christine Brown's report and case law. The  fact  this  finding  is
        recorded in paragraph 56 (8) is irrelevant as this is  the  section
        of the determination in which the Panel draws the threads of  their
        its deliberations together by considering the criteria set down  in
        Uner v Netherlands. The  claim  in  paragraph  20  of  the  renewed
        grounds seeking permission to appeal that at no point in  the  body
        of the determination does the Panel make an explicit  finding  that
        it would be in the children's best interest  for  their  father  to
        remain in the UK is therefore factually incorrect.


    16. The submissions are in effect a challenge to the  weight  given  to
        the evidence from Christine Brown  regarding  the  children's  best
        interests but weight is a matter  for  the  Panel  provided  it  is
        demonstrated they havit  hase  considered  the  evidence  with  the
        degree of care required in an appeal of this  nature  and  adequate
        reasons have been given for the findings made - see SS (Sri  Lanka)
        v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA  Civ  155.
        In this appeal we find they haveit has. Reasons do not have  to  be
        given for each and every element  of  the  evidence  -  see  Shizad
        (sufficiency of reasons: set aside) [2013] UKUT 85 (IAC)


    17. Paragraph 26 of the grounds contains a specific allegation that the
        Panel's assessment of the evidence of Christine  Brown  is  flawed.
        There is a reference to paragraph 5.1 of the report  in  which  Mrs
        Brown states that the appellant's removal would prove  critical  at
        this point in the children's lives  and  would  fail  to  keep  the
        family intact. Miss Mair also relies upon a quote from  the  report
        in which it is stated that separation will be a profound and  truly
        awful event from which they will never truly recover or be able  to
        forget. The finding to the contrary by the Panel is challenged  for
        lack of adequate reasoning.


    18. We accept that in paragraph 50 of the determination the Panel  does
        appear to reject Christine Brown's opinion relating to  the  effect
        of the  appellant  being  deported  and  his  separation  upon  the
        children. They It bases its their conclusions not on the fact  that
        the appellant is responsible for the cause of  the  phenomenon,  as
        alleged, but that the children have already  survived  three  years
        separation as a result of his criminal activities. Whilst  this  in
        itself may be insufficient reasoning for rejecting the consequences
        of deportation the Panel in the next line of paragraph  50  accepts
        the conclusions of Christine Brown in relation to the effect on the
        children.   Grounds  reliant   on   selective   quotes   from   the
        determination do not present the complete picture.


    19. Miss Mair also criticises the  Panel  for  their  its  comments  in
        paragraph 50 regarding the fact some children often  have  to  cope
        with  the  trauma  of  loosing  a  parent  and  the  availably   of
        professional support to assist if needed. This is not a  comparison
        with a situation of bereavement in a family although the loss of  a
        parent for any reason can have the same affect on a child. The loss
        of a parent can happen by death,  deportation,  marital  breakdown,
        abandonment or statutory intervention and removal. The finding  the
        children can be  helped  through  any  grieving  process  by  their
        remaining parent and professional support is a finding open to  the
        Panel on the evidence.  There are a number of testimonials  in  the
        bundle, [pages 166 to 181] including a letter of support  from  the
        family GP  referring  to  the  appellant's  wife's  depression  and
        anxiety.  We  accept  there  is  no  evidence  of  current  ongoing
        professional support and that any reference  to  the  same  may  be
        factually inaccurate, but  that  does  not  mean  it  will  not  be
        available in the future if needed. The fact there is  currently  no
        intervention is, we find, because there are no concerns in relation
        to the physical or emotional development of the  children,  despite
        the appellant's absence due to his conviction.      We  find  it  a
        sustainable finding that  services  are  available  to  assist  the
        children which can include counselling and work to enable  them  to
        understand  the  reason  for  their  father's  removal  and  family
        support. We find it has not been proved that if such help is sought
        it will not be sufficient to help the children understand and adapt
        even if their sadness and distress at  the  loss  of  their  father
        remains with them. It was also accepted by Miss Mair  that  if  the
        family reached crisis point post-removal, support services would be
        available.


    20. It was suggested to Miss Mair that the submissions being made  were
        in effect that the needs of the children should have  been  treated
        by the Panel as the  paramount  factor  and  determinative  of  the
        outcome. This was denied and it submitted  that  the  Panel  should
        have assessed the best interests and then seen what  countervailing
        facts were applicable.


    21. In the recent case of SS (Nigeria) V SSHD [2013] EWCA Civ 550, Laws
        LJ reviewed the case law relevant to these issues and at  paragraph
        55 of the judgment set out the correct approach when stating:




               55.  None  of  this,  I  apprehend,  is   inconsistent   with
   established principle, and                the approach I have outlined is
   well supported by  the  authorities                       concerning  the
   decision-maker's   margin   of   discretion.    The    leading    Supreme
   Court cases, ZH and H(H), demonstrate  that  the  interests  of  a  child
   affected                by a removal decision are a matter of substantial
   importance, and that the                  court must proceed on a  proper
   understanding of the facts which                        illuminate  those
   interests  (though   upon   the   latter   point   I   would   not   with
   respect accept that the decision  in  Tinizaray  should  be  regarded  as
          establishing anything in the nature of general principle). At  the
   same time               H(H)  shows  the  impact  of  a  powerful  public
   interest (in that case                    extradition) on what  needs  to
   be demonstrated for an Article 8 claim to                   prevail  over
   it.  Proportionality,  the  absence  of  an  "exceptionality"  rule,  and
     the meaning  of  "a  primary  consideration"  are  all,  when  properly
          understood, consonant with the force to be attached  in  cases  of
   the present                  kind to the two  drivers  of  the  decision-
   maker's margin of discretion: the                   policy's  source  and
   the  policy's  nature,  and   in   particular   to   the   great   weight
   which the 2007 Act attributes to the deportation of foreign criminals.


    22. We find the Panel were was aware of the substantial  importance  of
        the interests of the children, as shown by paragraph 45,  and  that
        they it understood the relevant facts they it needed  to  consider.
        Having done so they it arrived that the conclusion in paragraph  56
        (8) that the best  interests  were  for  this  family  to  be  kept
        together. This is in  accordance  with  the  opinion  of  Christine
        Brown.


    23. This  is  not,  however,  the  determinative  factor  as  the  best
        interests  of  the  children  are  one  element  of  the  balancing
        exercise, albeit one  of  substantial  importance.  Had  the  Panel
        allowed the appeal on the  basis  of  the  needs  of  the  children
        without considering the respondents position that in its self would
        have been an error of law. They It did not.  The  Panel  considered
        both parties' positions and in paragraph 54 concludes  that  it  is
        necessary ion a democratic society for the appellant to be deported
        to  prevent  crime  and  disorder.  The  Panel  finds  there  is  a
        propensity to re-offend for the reasons given which  is  challenged
        before us on the basis the appellant was assessed as a low risk  of
        re-offending in the OASys report dated 12th September 2011. We note
        in that report the fact the appellant  continued  to  minimise  his
        role in the offences [R6.1 page 91 of A's bundle] and that the risk
        of re-offending is not determinative of the case.


    24.  Miss  Mair  quite  properly  accepted  that  the  case  of   Masih
        (deportation - public interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012]
        UKUT 00046(IAC) Masih was relevant to this matter. In  Masih  Masih
        (deportation - public interest - basic principles) Pakistan [2012]
        UKUT 00046(IAC)  the Tribunal said that so long as account is taken
        of the following basic principles, there is at present no need  for
        further citation of authority on the public interest  side  of  the
        balancing exercise. The following basic principles can  be  derived
        from the present case  law  concerning  the  issue  of  the  public
        interest in relation to the deportation of foreign criminals:


              (i)      In a case of automatic deportation, full account must
   be taken of  the                   strong  public  interest  in  removing
   foreign  citizens  convicted  of                      serious  offences,
   which lies not only in the prevention of further                 offences
   on  the  part   of   the   individual   concerned,   but   in   deterring
   others from committing them in the first place.


              (ii)     Deportation of foreign criminals expresses  society's
   condemnation of                  serious criminal activity  and  promotes
   public  confidence  in  the                       treatment  of   foreign
   citizens who have committed them.


              (iii)    The starting-point for  assessing  the  facts  of the
   offence of which an                   individual has been committed,  and
   their effect on others, and on the                  public  as  a  whole,
   must be the view taken by the sentencing judge.


              (iv)     The appeal has to be dealt with on the basis  of  the
   situation at the                 date of the hearing.


              (v)      Full account should also be taken of any developments
   since                   sentence was passed, for example  the  result  of
   any  disciplinary                        adjudications   in   prison   or
   detention, or any OASys or licence report.


    25. In Boultif v Switzerland [2001] ECHR 54273, as confirmed by Uner  v
        the Netherlands [2007] Imm AR 303, the Court said that in order  to
        assess whether an expulsion measure was necessary in  a  democratic
        society and  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim  pursued,  the
        following criteria had to be considered:


              (i)  The nature and the seriousness of the  offence  committed
      by the                Appellant;


              (ii) The length of the Appellant's stay in  the  country  from
      which he or           she was to be expelled;


              (iii)    The time that  had  elapsed  since  the  offence  was
      committed and the             claimant's conduct during that period.


              (iv)  The nationalities of the various parties concerned;
              (v)  The Appellant's  family  situation,  such  as  length  of
      marriage and              other factors expressing  the  effectiveness
      of the Appellant's family              life;


              (vi) Whether the spouse knew about the offence at the time  he
      or she           entered into the family relationship;


              (vii)    Whether there are children in the marriage and if  so
      their ages;


              (viii)The seriousness and the difficulties which the Spouse is
      likely to             encounter in  the  country  of  the  Appellant's
      origin;


              (ix) The best interests and well being of any children of  the
      Appellant;             and  in  particular  the  seriousness  of   any
      difficulties that they would           be likely to encounter  in  the
      country to which the Appellant would            be expelled;


              (x)  The solidity of social, cultural and family ties with the
      host country              and with the country of destination.


    26. These elements were properly considered by the Panel.


    27. In SS (Nigeria), at paragraph 53 and 54, it is stated:




              53. The importance of the moral and political character of the
   policy shows that                the two drivers of the  decision-maker's
   margin of discretion - the policy's                nature and its  source
   - operate in tandem. An Act of Parliament is  anyway                   to
   be specially respected; but all the more so when it  declares  policy  of
   this                kind.  In  this  case,  the  policy  is  general  and
   overarching. It is circumscribed                   only by five carefully
   drawn   exceptions,   of   which   the   first   is   violation   of    a
   person's  Convention/Refugee  Convention  rights.  (The  others   concern
     minors, EU cases, extradition cases and cases involving persons subject
   to                  orders under  mental  health  legislation.)  Clearly,
   Parliament in the 2007 Act                has attached very great  weight
   to the policy as  a  well  justified  imperative                 for  the
   protection  of  the  public  and   to   reflect   the   public's   proper
     condemnation of serious wrongdoers. Sedley LJ was with respect right to
                  state that "[in the case of a 'foreign criminal'  the  Act
   places  in  the                     proportionality  scales  a   markedly
   greater weight than in other cases".


              54.  I  would  draw  particular  attention  to  the  provision
   contained in s.33(7):                 "section 32(4) applies despite  the
   application of  Exception  1...",  that  is  to                   say,  a
   foreign criminal's deportation  remains  conducive  to  the  public  good
     notwithstanding his  successful  reliance  on  Article  8.  I  said  at
   paragraph 46                 that while the authorities demonstrate  that
   there is no rule of exceptionality                 for  Article  8,  they
   also   clearly   show    that    the    more    pressing    the    public
   interest in removal or deportation, the stronger must be the claim  under
              Article 8 if it is to prevail.  The  pressing  nature  of  the
   public interest here is                   vividly informed  by  the  fact
   that  by  Parliament's  express  declaration  the                  public
   interest is injured if the criminal's deportation is not effected. Such a
                  result could in my judgment only be justified  by  a  very
   strong claim                     indeed.


    28.  The  appellant's  involvement  in  the  commercial  production  of
        cannabis for economic gain, as found by the sentencing judge, is  a
        very serous offence. His deportation is in the public interests and
        for the public good as declared by  Parliament  in  the  2007  Act.
        Notwithstanding the  assessment  of  there  being  a  low  risk  of
        reoffending and the effect upon the family flowing from  separation
        from the appellant, it is within the range of permissible  findings
        available to the Panel to find that the weight to be given  to  the
        respondent's case tipped the proportionality assessment  in  favour
        of deportation. The grounds are in effect a disagreement with  this
        conclusion based upon an argument that greater weight  should  have
        been given to the interests of  the  children.  The  outcome  of  a
        properly conducted proportionality assessment,  we  which  we  find
        this is, can only be challenged on public law grounds. We  find  no
        such grounds  proved  in  this  case  sufficient  to  allow  us  to
        interfere with the decision.
