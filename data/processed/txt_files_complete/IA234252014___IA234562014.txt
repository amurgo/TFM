               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent

Representation:

For the Appellants:    Mr Iqbal, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Norton, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The appellants are citizens of India born on 10 February  1986  and  15
    October 1988 respectively.  They appeal against a decision of the First-
    tier Tribunal, Judge Swaniker issued on  24  February  2015  dismissing
    their appeals against the respondent's decision made  on  29  May  2014
    refusing them further leave to remain as Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrants
    under the points-based system under the provisions of both  para  245DD
    of the rules and para 322(1A) on the basis that  false  representations
    had been made in relation to the application.

2.   At the hearing before me the second appellant  was  represented  by  Mr
    Iqbal but there was  no  appearance  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  first
    appellant.  I am satisfied that notice of hearing was  properly  served
    on him.  The second appellant said that he believed the first appellant
    had returned to India because his father had been  taken  ill  but  the
    respondent is not at this stage able to confirm whether that is in fact
    the case.  In any event, I am satisfied that the proper  course  is  to
    proceed with the hearing in his absence.

Background

3.   The brief background to  this  appeal  is  that  both  appellants  have
    previously had leave to enter and  remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  as
    students and then as Tier 1 (Post-Study Work) Migrants.  On 14 February
    2014 they made a joint application  for  leave  to  remain  as  Tier  1
    (Entrepreneur) Migrants.  In order to meet the requirements of Appendix
    A they had to show that they had access to funds  as  required  by  the
    rules, namely access  to  not  less  than  ï¿½50,000  from  one  or  more
    registered venture capital firms regulated  by  the  Financial  Conduct
    Authority (FCA).  In support  of  their  application  they  produced  a
    letter from Future Venture Capital, which was claimed to be a fund  set
    up through Future Capital Partners, a solicitor's  letter  from  Ramsay
    Employment Law and an accountant's letter from  Active  Corporate,  all
    documents dated 11 February 2014.  The respondent  was  satisfied  that
    the claim to have access to funds from  a  registered  venture  capital
    firm regulated by the FCA was false in that a check of the FCA register
    had revealed no connection between Future Venture  Capital  and  Future
    Capital Partners.

The Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal Judge.

4.   At the hearing before the  First-tier  Tribunal  both  appellants  gave
    oral evidence and the judge set out her  findings  of  credibility  and
    fact in [14]-[20].  She found that the appellants had failed to provide
    any credible evidence to show that either  Future  Venture  Capital  or
    Future Capital Partners were registered with the FCA as required.   She
    noted that they had claimed in their evidence that they  had  conducted
    an internet search to find a compatible company  operating  in  the  IT
    sector to act as their backers.  They had made enquiries  about  Future
    Venture Capital because it supported energy resources and the IT sector
    and they had found the  company  registered  with  the  FCA  when  they
    checked.  The judge took into account the letter dated 11 February 2014
    in which Future Venture Capital clearly and  unequivocally  represented
    itself as a fund set up through Future  Capital  Partners.   She  found
    that those claims contradicted a  subsequent  letter  of  2  June  2014
    produced in evidence describing  it  as  deliberately  opaque  and  not
    directly addressing the key issue in the respondent's  decision  letter
    that neither Future Venture Capital nor Future  Capital  Partners  were
    registered with the FCA.

5.   The judge found it devoid of credibility that  Future  Venture  Capital
    would hold itself out as  being  a  fund  established  by  a  regulated
    organisation without being assured of its registration and adherence to
    any regulatory requirements.  She found that the  appellants  were  not
    reliable witnesses whose word could be relied on: they claimed to  have
    made their own enquiries and to have checked the  registration  of  the
    organisations with the FCA.  She therefore found  that  the  appellants
    could not meet the requirements of the rules.  She noted that a further
    letter of 11 June 2014  and  the  offer  of  funding  letter  from  new
    proposed funders sought to present the offers as having been  in  place
    at the time of the application.  She found that this was  extraordinary
    and indicative of the overall lack of transparency of  the  application
    and that the attempt made to date the offer as available from the  time
    of  application  to  be  little  more  than  the  blatant  attempt   to
    misrepresent the position.  For these reasons the judge  dismissed  the
    appeal both under para 322(1A) and 245DD and Appendix A.

The Grounds of Appeal and Submissions

6.   Permission to appeal was granted by the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  the
    following reasons:

         "...
           (a).     The  respondent  in  refusing  the  applications   under
             paragraph 245DD of the Immigration Rules, also  asserted  that
             false representations had been made under para 322(1A).


         (b)  It is arguable at paragraph 19 of the decision on finding that
             the appellants were not entitled to the  requisite  points  in
             respect of funds, the judge has wrongly conflated  para  245DD
             and para 322(1A).  Rather than  make  a  separate  finding  on
             whether or not false representations had been made."

7.   In his submissions Mr Iqbal made it clear that he was  not  seeking  to
    challenge the decision under para 245DD but  only  the  decision  under
    para 322(1A).  He referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  A
    v Secretary of State [2010] EWCA Civ 733 that "false"  did  not  simply
    mean incorrect but dishonest.  He conceded  that  the  judge  had  been
    entitled to reach her conclusions on whether the requirements  at  para
    245DD were met but argued that the judge not given proper consideration
    on whether dishonesty had been established within para 322(1A).  It was
    his argument that, having carefully considered the requirements of para
    245DD, the judge appeared to have assumed that the provisions  of  para
    322(1A) were established when in fact she had  not  made  any  specific
    findings on the issue of dishonesty.  The appellants could not,  so  he
    submitted, have a finding made against them under para  322(1A)  unless
    they were aware of the falsity of the representation.  It had not  been
    established that they had made anything other than an innocent mistake.
     He also referred to the judge's summary of the burden and standard  of
    proof in [7]-[8] and the fact that she had made  no  reference  to  the
    burden of establishing falsity being on the respondent.

8.   Mr Norton submitted that the judge had  not  erred  in  law.   She  had
    carefully examined the evidence and reached a conclusion properly  open
    to her.  Her findings made it clear that the appellants had been  aware
    that they had submitted a document which was false  and  had  tried  to
    maintain the deception at the hearing.

Assessment of whether there is an Error of Law.

9.   The issue for me is whether the First-tier Tribunal erred in  law  such
    that its decision should be set aside.  I am not satisfied  that  there
    is any such error.  The respondent refused the application for  further
    leave as a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) Migrant because the evidence submitted
    by the appellants with their applications did  not  meet  the  criteria
    specified under Appendix A because neither Future Venture  Capital  nor
    Future Capital Partners were independent venture capital firms directly
    regulated by the FCA, no trace was found to confirm that Future Venture
    Capital or Future Capital Partners  had  permission  to  operate  as  a
    venture capital firm by the FCA and a check with the  FCA  revealed  no
    connection between Future Venture Capital and Future  Capital  Partners
    Ltd.

10.  In their evidence the appellants asserted that they had made  enquiries
    about Future Venture Capital and had found the company registered  with
    the FCA when they checked.  The judge found that there was no objective
    or reliable evidence to support the assertion that was put  forward  as
    to whether either were registered with the FCA as required.  She  noted
    that in the letter dated 11 February 2014 Future Venture  Capital  held
    itself out as a fund set up through Future Capital Partners  authorised
    and regulated by the FCA.  The assertions were supported by the  letter
    dated 11 February 2014 from Active Corporate.   The  judge  found  that
    these letters could not be relied on.

11.  At the hearing before her further documents were produced dated 2  June
    2014, 11 June 2014, 13 and 16 June 2014 purporting  to  show  that  the
    appellants did have access to the capital sum required  but  the  judge
    clearly did not regard them as reliable  commenting  on  the  fact  the
    letter from Future Venture Capital dated 2 June 2014 said that they had
    secured a promise of funds from three separate sources at the  time  of
    the appellants' application and had made an offer in  association  with
    Future Capital Partners but it had now come  to  their  attention  that
    Future Capital Partners  had  not  registered  them  as  the  appointed
    representatives acting on behalf of the funds and  that  the  situation
    was outside their control but the offer to the  appellants  facilitated
    through themselves would have to be withdrawn and  replaced  reassuring
    the  appellants  that  the  other  two  sponsors  were  regulated   for
    investments with the FCA.  The judge also said at [17] that the  letter
    dated 11 June 2014 from Philpot Venture Capital Fund seeking to present
    the offers having been in place at the  time  of  the  application  was
    indicative of the overall lack of transparency with the application.

12.  When the judge's reasons are read as whole it is  clear  that  she  was
    satisfied that the applicants were aware that  a  false  representation
    had been made.  In the light of that finding and applying  the  law  as
    set out in A v Secretary of State, it was clearly open to the judge  to
    find that the appellants had knowingly put forward an application which
    they knew to be false.  I am not  satisfied  that  the  judge  did  not
    properly consider the position under para 322(1A).  It is  correct  the
    judge did not set out in her self-direction in [7]-[8]  that  the  onus
    was on the respondent to establish dishonesty but there is  nothing  in
    the judge's analysis of the evidence or in the  way  she  set  out  her
    conclusions to indicate that she was under any  misapprehension  as  to
    either the burden or standard of proof.

13.  In summary, I am satisfied that the judge's  findings  and  conclusions
    were properly open to her for the reasons she gave and that she did not
    err in law.

Decision

14.  The First-tier Tribunal did not err in law  and  its  decision  stands.
    This appeal is dismissed.
