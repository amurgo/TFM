For the Appellant:     Ms Dirie of Counsel, instructed by Wilson Solicitors
LLP
For the Respondent:    Ms Jones, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant is a national of Nigeria born in 1991.  She appeals  with
    permission the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Rai)  to
    dismiss her protection appeal.

 2. The basis of the Appellant's  claim  is  that  she  fears  gender-based
    violence up to and including Female Genital  Mutilation  (FGM)  at  the
    hands of her father and/or his wider family. She cannot  reasonably  be
    expected to relocate to another part of Nigeria because she is  a  lone
    woman with mental health  issues.   The  Respondent  refused  to  grant
    protection on the 9th November 2015 and the Appellant appealed.

 3. The First-tier Tribunal found as fact that the  Appellant  is  an  Igbo
    woman of royal lineage.  She was born out of wedlock and  as  a  result
    she suffered discrimination from her father and other  members  of  the
    family. When she was seven, and her younger sister  only  three,  their
    mother fled the family home after suffering serious domestic  violence.
     After their  mother  left  the  girls  were  repeatedly  subjected  to
    violence at the hands of their father,  who  was  both  physically  and
    emotionally abusive. When he discovered that the  Appellant  was  being
    sexually molested by a family acquaintance, he blamed her. He suggested
    that her behaviour, and the fact that she was being  abused,  were  the
    result of her refusal to undergo FGM: he made repeated reference to the
    fact that she had not been 'cut' and expressed a wish that she  undergo
    the procedure.  When the  Appellant  was  17  her  mother  returned  to
    Nigeria and managed to get her and her sister out, first to Gambia  and
    then on student visas to the United Kingdom. Since her arrival here the
    Appellant has experienced the psychological sequalae of  her  childhood
    abuse: the evidence before the First-tier Tribunal indicated  that  she
    has been diagnosed with depression  and  suffers  from  trauma  related
    anxiety.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal accepted that the Appellant has spoken  to  her
    father by telephone and via social media and that he has threatened her
    and told  her  that  she  was  ungrateful  for  leaving  Nigeria  after
    everything he had done for her.  An expert witness  instructed  by  the
    Appellant's solicitors sent a representative  in  Nigeria  on  a  field
    visit, who reported that her paternal home area  has  an  FGM  rate  of
    23.4%.

 5. What the First-tier Tribunal did not accept was that Appellant's father
    would in fact carry out his threats. Although he had made reference  to
    FGM when she was a child, he had not in fact enforced the procedure  on
    her. He is obviously a 'connected' individual who knows a lot of people
    in the Nigerian community in the United Kingdom, yet he  has  not  sent
    anyone to physically intimidate or harm her here.  He may make  similar
    assertions today but lacks  the  means  or  motivation  to  locate  the
    Appellant and enforce the procedure on her.  The Appellant's sister has
    returned to Nigeria but there is no evidence that she has been  subject
    to FGM.  Nor did the  First-tier  Tribunal  regard  as  'credible'  the
    assertions of the expert witness that an intermediary had contacted the
    Appellant's father who had confirmed in conversation that he would have
    his daughters cut.   The First-tier Tribunal was further satisfied that
    there would be a sufficiency of protection  provided  by  the  Nigerian
    state.  For those reasons, the appeal was dismissed.

    Error of Law: Discussion and Findings

 6. The  primary  difficulty  with  the  determination  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal is its structure.

 7. The first task for the Tribunal was to decide whether the Appellant has
    a well-founded fear of persecution in her home area  today.  Given  its
    findings that both she, and her mother, were in the past  subjected  to
    serious domestic violence at the hands of their father,  there  was  an
    operative presumption that she would continue to face a  real  risk  of
    harm today: see paragraph 339K of the Immigration Rules. The next stage
    should have been for the Tribunal to consider whether  there  are  good
    reasons to believe that the risk of harm  has  abated:  given  that  it
    accepted that the Appellant's father continues  to  threaten  her,  and
    behave in a way generally consistent with a domestic abuser, it is hard
    to see that the presumption of harm could have been rebutted.  The next
    question should then have been whether the Appellant  could  reasonably
    be expected to avail herself of an internal flight alternative.

 8. The Tribunal did none of that: it instead embarked upon  an  assessment
    of whether  the  Appellant  faces  a  risk  of  harm  from  her  father
    "worldwide", taking into account such irrelevant matters as whether  he
    has managed to 'reach' her in London, or  whether  he  would  have  the
    means to locate and kidnap her the minute she landed in Nigeria.   This
    was an error in approach.

 9. As to whether there is a sufficiency of protection  available  to  this
    Appellant,  Ms  Dirie  submitted  that  the  Tribunal's  reasoning   at
    paragraph 43 of its decision  is  inadequate:  "in  general,  effective
    state protection is likely to be  available".   That  finding  is  made
    absent any detailed consideration of the country  background  evidence,
    nor indeed the  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  been  subjected  to
    approximately ten years of serious harm at the  hands  of  her  father,
    with no state intervention at all. I  accept  that  the  assessment  of
    state protection is flawed for a failure to take all relevant  material
    into account. Whilst the First-tier Tribunal  records  that  the  "CPIN
    confirms that FGM is unlawful in Nigeria" that is plainly not the whole
    picture, as the CPIN itself acknowledges:

         '2.5.8  In  general,  the  Federal  State  is  likely  to   provide
         protection. However, it remains difficult to obtain  protection  in
         all states outside the  Federal  capital  of  Abuja  where  FGM  is
         prevalent. Each case will need to be considered on  its  particular
         circumstances taking into account factors such as the person's age,
         socio-economic circumstances, education,  ethnicity  and  the  area
         they will return to.'

10. Although she contested the grounds generally  I  should  note  that  Ms
    Jones on behalf of the Respondent was prepared to accept, in respect of
    the final ground, that the Tribunal did  not  give  particularly  clear
    reasons for rejecting one element of the expert  report.  The  Tribunal
    expressly accepted that the author, Abaobi Nkeokelonye,  is  an  expert
    and that significant weight can be attached to her evidence. Part of Ms
    Nkeokelonye's research methodology was to use  trusted  researchers  in
    Nigeria to undertake field visits, and to elicit from  the  Appellant's
    father his views on matters including FGM.    He  told  the  researcher
    that although he was Christian, and perceived to hold progressive views
    within that faith, the church and Christian values must not be  allowed
    to erode "certain cultural practices".  He was  not  moved  by  popular
    opinion on matters such as FGM. It was particularly  important  to  him
    that this tradition be preserved within  his  family,  because  of  its
    royal lineage: "royal families live by different standards and  not  by
    general standards, according to him". He further told the researcher of
    his displeasure with his daughter  who  had  refused  to  undergo  this
    procedure.    The Tribunal appeared to discount  all  of  this  on  the
    grounds that it was not 'credible' that such a conversation took place.
    Ms Jones accepted that  if  this  man  is  a  violent  and  controlling
    patriarch who also performs a public role as a pastor  it  is  in  fact
    plausible that he would divulge such information to someone  ostensibly
    interested in finding out his views of matters concerning  Christianity
    vis-�-vis 'traditional' Igbo cultural practice.

11. For all of these reasons, the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  is
    set aside.      The issues on remaking are:

      a) Whether there is good reason  to  believe  that  the  Appellant  no
         longer faces a real risk of harm at the hands of her father;

      b) Whether the Nigerian  state  is  able  and  willing  to  provide  a
         sufficiency of protection;

      c) Whether it would  be  unduly  harsh  to  expect  the  Appellant  to
         internally relocate.

    Risk

12. As I note [at my �7 above], the First-tier Tribunal accepted  that  the
    Appellant has been subject to serious physical and  psychological  ill-
    treatment at the hands of  her  father  in  the  past.   Although  that
    finding is preserved and I need say no more about it, I  note  for  the
    sake of completeness that the evidence of that harm  is  compelling.  A
    medico-legal report by Dr Bernadette de Jager dated the 12th  May  2017
    confirms several areas  of  scarring  to  the  Appellant's  body,  some
    typical of her  having  been  beaten  with  a  cane,  and  some  highly
    consistent with her having been cut repeatedly with a blade.  A  series
    of psychological reports by Clinical Psychologist Dr Eileen  Walsh,  to
    which I return in detail below, find that the  Appellant  continues  to
    suffer profound psychological harm resulting from her experiences, such
    that a diagnosis of complex Post-Traumatic Stress  Disorder  and  Major
    Depressive Disorder have now been made. These reports are to be read in
    conjunction with the Appellant's own detailed, and harrowing,  evidence
    of about her childhood and adolescence, and all of that set against the
    background of country background evidence which shows violence  against
    women and children to be commonplace in Nigeria.

13. The question is whether the Appellant remains at risk from  her  father
    today. Ms Jones points out that the statistics on FGM do  not  indicate
    that the practice is  routinely  performed  on  adult  women,  and  she
    questions whether the Appellant's  father  would  continue  to  pose  a
    threat to the Appellant, particularly given  that  her  younger  sister
    has, for reasons unknown, elected to return to the fold of her paternal
    family.  As I noted at the initial hearing in this matter, the risk  of
    FGM is just one element of the threatened harm in this case. It is part
    and parcel of the patriarchal norms, and violence,  that  governed  the
    Appellant's family  life  in  Nigeria.  Her  father  believed  that  he
    controlled every  aspect  of  her  existence,  and  as  she  grew  into
    womanhood this included her sexuality. FGM, like domestic violence,  is
    all  about  control.   Given  his  past  behaviour,  and  applying  the
    Demirkaya presumption in paragraph 339K of the Rules, I can see no good
    reason to believe that he would  behave  any  differently  towards  his
    daughter today. Indeed it seems likely that her departure from  Nigeria
    and her prolonged absence would exacerbate his response.

14. Somewhat unusually however, the Appellant in this case need not  simply
    rely on the Demirkaya presumption of renewed harm. That is because  she
    has  obtained  clear  evidence  that  her  father's  attitudes   remain
    unchanged.  First there was her own credible evidence, accepted by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, that he  has  since  her  arrival  in  the  United
    Kingdom made threats  to  her  over  the  telephone  and  social  media
    platforms.  Second, and in greater detail, is the evidence contained in
    Ms Nkeokelonye's report.   Ms Nkeokelonye  is  an  academic  researcher
    focusing on social development in Nigeria, with a particular  focus  on
    gender issues.  She has acted  as  a  consultant  to  a  number  of  UN
    agencies, DFID and USAid amongst others.  No issue is  taken  with  her
    expertise.     I  found  her  report  to  be  clear,  well-sourced  and
    balanced.

15. Ms Nkeokelonye explains the background to the evidence  she  offers  in
    her report. She asked a colleague in Lagos  to  visit  the  Appellant's
    father at his church in order to assess the size  of  the  congregation
    etc (at the time this was considered relevant to the  question  of  his
    'reach' within Nigeria - I would observe that an example of the balance
    shown in the report is  that  it  is  found  to  be  small  and  rather
    insignificant outside of his  neighbourhood).  Ms  Nkeokelonye  further
    asked her colleague to try and elicit his views on social matters  such
    as FGM and women in society generally.  I  have  altered  the  text  in
    accordance with my own anonymity order:

         "97. I note that the client  expressed  fear  of  being  forced  to
         undergo FGM by her father upon her return to Nigeria. At  the  time
         of this  research,  an  on-going  phone  discussion  was  initiated
         between an intermediary and [the  Appellant's  father]  to  further
         elicit  information   on   his   personal   views   regarding   the
         intersections of culture and religion, with  a  focus  on  relevant
         issues in Anambra state such as the Osu Caste system  and  FGM.  In
         his responses, [the Appellant's father] though perceived to be very
         progressive with his religious belief, was  of  the  view  that  in
         spite of the widespread adoption of the Christian  values,  certain
         cultural practices must not be eroded as they  remain  an  integral
         part of a people's identity.

         98.  Alluding to the practice  of  FGM,  [the  Appellant's  father]
         explained that though FGM, like the abolished Osu Caste system, was
         perceived as a dying tradition, he was not moved by popular opinion
         or his religious belief in such issues due to  the  fact  that  the
         [Appellant's family] was of royal lineage. Royal families lived  by
         different standards and not by general standards, according to him.
         He further gave examples of an FGM-related ritual which the  female
         members of their family had to undergo. He expressed displeasure on
         the fact that his first daughter, whom he was  not  in  good  terms
         with, had - with the support of her mother  -  refused  to  undergo
         this family tradition. He made it clear that only the marriage of a
         daughter could prevent him from ensuring  she  honours  the  family
         tradition. In his words:

             "My daughter is greatly influenced by the ex-wife who is aware
             of our family tradition and refuses to comply. If my  daughter
             ever comes into the country without a  husband,  she  will  be
             picked up from anywhere in Nigeria and delivered to  Nnewi  to
             honour this family tradition.  I  joined  in  ensuring  female
             children born to my siblings undergo  this,  my  own  children
             shouldn't be different".

         100. There  is  an  apparent  paradox  to  the  character  of  [the
         Appellant's father], he portrayed a complex personality in that  he
         had selective beliefs that were not objectively consistent with the
         Christianity which he professed. His belief in traditional  rituals
         that strengthen his royal lineage contradicted his faith. This kind
         of apparent contradiction is far from  being  uncommon  among  some
         Nigerian Pastors.

         101. Further enquiries were made through the members of  the  Lagos
         and  Anambra  state  chapters   of   [Appellant's   home   village]
         associations  on  the  religious  background  of  the  [Appellant's
         family]  ...  Findings  revealed  a  peculiar   trend   among   the
         [Appellant's family] in [the home  village].  While  they  strongly
         profess the Christian faith with about four members of  the  family
         serving as Pastors in different churches, they also placed a strong
         value on tradition even when it negated their faith. For example, a
         brother of [the Appellant's father] who is known to be a Pastor  is
         also a renowned polygamist.

         102. Further enquiries were made to ascertain the claim  that  [the
         Appellant's family] was of royal lineage. While they are not  known
         to be the present ruling family in [their home village], they  have
         been strongly associated with some of the crowned heads.

         103. Royal families in Nigeria are known to enjoy  some  privileges
         that ordinary families do not.  They  are  sometimes  judged  by  a
         different standard. The system of governance in Nigeria  recognises
         conflicting values of customary laws as relevant  to  modern  state
         governance, creating an immunity shield for  certain  practices  of
         the royal families that aid in perpetuating abuse of human rights."



16. Having taken all of that evidence into account I am satisfied  that  as
    of today's date there remains a  real  risk  of  serious  harm  to  the
    Appellant in her home town of Lagos, as  well  as  her  ancestral  home
    state of Ananbra. That harm includes physical 'domestic'  violence  and
    FGM.




    Protection

17. Both parties referred extensively to the country background information
    on Nigeria. Before I turn to examine that evidence  it  is  appropriate
    that I mark Ms Dirie's submission that there has already been a failure
    of state protection for the Appellant, who was during her childhood  in
    Nigeria sexually, physically and mentally abused.   Whilst  that  forms
    the background  to  my  forward  looking  risk  assessment,  it  cannot
    properly be determinative of it, not least because  the  Appellant  was
    then a child but is now a woman; furthermore the Respondent submits the
    situation for women in Nigeria to be constantly improving.  I therefore
    assess the matter of protection with reference to the current evidence.

18. The Respondent's case can be summarised  as  follows.   First  that  in
    general terms the government of Nigeria demonstrates a willingness  and
    ability to provide a sufficient level of protection to its citizens, in
    that it has an operative legal and criminal  justice  system.  That  it
    meets this baseline Horvath standard,  in  respect  of  the  population
    generally, was not contested by Ms Dirie.

19. The Respondent further relies on the measures  taken  by  the  Nigerian
    government to combat FGM. The 2019 Country Policy and Information  Note
    Nigeria: Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)  sets  out  how  the  Violence
    against Persons (Prohibition) Act 2015 (hereinafter VAPP) is a  federal
    law  that  prohibits  inter  alia  female  circumcision  and  that  the
    penalties include four years' imprisonment for  any  perpetrator  found
    guilty:  I note  that  Ananmbra  state  is  one  of  the  few  to  have
    specifically adopted this federal  law.  Of  this  evidence,  Ms  Dirie
    strongly contested that VAPP provides anything  approaching  a  Horvath
    sufficiency of protection for women within the 'private sphere' of  the
    family.

20. The first difficulty, submits Ms Dirie,  is  that  FGM,  like  domestic
    violence against women generally, is perceived to be a  private  matter
    for  individual  families  to  resolve.  Whilst  both  are   officially
    outlawed, the evidence suggests that the state will defer to the family
    as the primary adjudicator on such matters. Ms Dirie asked me to  place
    weight upon an expert report by Ms Victoria Ijeoma Nwogu,  a  barrister
    and solicitor of the Supreme Court  of  Nigeria  with  over  18  years'
    experience in the fields of gender and human rights. Ms Nwogu acts as a
    consultant to a number of international organisations and has published
    widely on women's issues in West Africa, in particular  in  respect  of
    trafficking, domestic violence and FGM. I accept that Ms Nwogu  appears
    well placed to comment on the issues in this appeal. She writes:

         "53. The way law enforcement officers respond to  violence  against
         women, specifically domestic violence, portrays societal  attitudes
         to the status of women. As I have  stated  earlier,  Nigeria  is  a
         patriarchal society, the father or male figure  is  held  in  total
         respect and awe as the head of the household. His powers  are  wide
         reaching in controlling the actions and destiny of the  members  of
         his family. A study presents this position,  'The  husband  derives
         power from being the supposed provider  and  head  of  the  family,
         which is ideologically based. The  power  includes  coercive  power
         which is often manifest in physical and mental subjugation  through
         violence.' In reacting to domestic violence Nigerian society always
         defers to this position of superiority of the male head  and  every
         opinion is sympathetic to maintaining his position.  The  woman  is
         blamed for acts of violence  that  she  suffers;  she  often  faces
         insinuations that she has  called  the  violence  upon  herself  by
         disobedience, insubordination or some fickle provocation.  In  such
         instances, the woman will win little sympathy from  society.  Where
         harm suffered through violence is evident  the  family/society  can
         sympathize and offer support to the woman only for a short time but
         will quickly begin to persuade the woman to  return  to  her  home,
         citing issues of family honour and  pride,  economic  security  and
         advantages of remaining in a marriage whether abusive or otherwise,
         sentimental issues with remaining  to  protect  the  children,  and
         especially the customary obligation of a woman  to  remain  in  her
         home and submit to the authority  of  her  husband  no  matter  the
         circumstances.

         54. The Amnesty International report confirmed this  position  with
         the findings it made that,

             'On a  daily  basis,  women  are  beaten  and  "punished"  for
             supposed transgressions, raped and even murdered by members of
             their family. In some cases, vicious acid attacks  leave  them
             with horrific disfigurements. Girls and young women are forced
             into  early  marriage  by  parents  and  relatives.  In   many
             communities,  the  traditional  practice  of  female   genital
             mutilation continues to traumatize young girls and leave women
             with lifelong pain and damage to their health.  Such  violence
             is all too frequently excused  and  tolerated  in  communities
             where women are assigned an inferior role, subordinate to  the
             male head of the family and effectively the property of  their
             husbands. Husbands, partners and fathers are  responsible  for
             most of the violence against women.'

         55. The police are also ineffective in protecting citizens as cited
         above and women are less  able  to  secure  police  protection  and
         investigation into gender-based  crimes  than  men  due  to  gender
         stereotypes about the roles  and  status  of  men  and  women.  The
         attitude of Police towards women complainants is discriminatory and
         patronizing. As the USSD 2016 report has shown, women  complainants
         may even face the threat of rape from Police officers."

21. Ms Nwogu's evidence on this point is consistent with the conclusions in
    the January 2020 Country Background Note: Nigeria, which refers to  the
    obstacles women face in trying to secure protection and redress in this
    context: violence against women in Nigeria is  described  as  "endemic"
    [at �16.1.1], and the culture "highly patriarchal" [16.1.2].   The 2019
    CPIN on FGM similarly records:

         '6.3.2 However, reporting with specific regard to rituals  relating
         to marriage, marital relations and pregnancy the source noted  that
         'The legal practitioner stated that the police would,  in  general,
         treat ritual practices related to marriage, marital relations,  and
         pregnancy or widowhood "as a family [or] community affair  and  may
         not interfere at all"'

22. It is against that background, submits Ms Dirie, that the state appears
    reluctant  to  enforce  VAPP  protection.     Having   summarised   the
    legislation the 2019 CPIN on FGM states:

         '6.6.1 According to the 2016 Annual Report of  the  United  Nations
         Population Fund/United Nations Children's Fund (UNFPA-UNICEF) Joint
         Programme  on  Female  Genital   Mutilation/Cutting:   Accelerating
         Change,  published  July  2017:  'There  were  no  cases   of   law
         enforcement in 2016.'

         6.6.2 28 Too Many stated: 'It has not been possible to identify any
         prosecutions brought under  the  VAPP  Act  in  Nigeria  since  its
         introduction in 2015.'

         6.6.3 An article by The Cable, a Nigerian on-line  newspaper,  'Two
         years after ban, FGM still rampant in Nigeria' published  3  August
         2017 also comments that despite the prevalence of  FGM  in  Nigeria
         still no one has been convicted. Family members who are usually the
         offenders are hard to condemn or report as the  occurrence  of  FGM
         often stays in the family.'

23. Ms Nwogu's evidence on VAPP is equally pessimistic:

         "Five years after its  adoption,  the  effectiveness  of  the  VAPP
         whether at Federal or state levels, to protect women from  violence
         in private and public spaces  or  provide  effective  remedies  for
         victims and punishment of offenders in  Nigeria  is  doubtful.  Law
         enforcement agents and institutions lack capacity and are unwilling
         to protect citizens from domestic violence for  example.  To  date,
         there are no known cases of effective  prosecution  and  punishment
         for gender-based violence against  women  using  the  VAPP  in  the
         states that have adopted it."

24. Whilst the adoption of VAPP in the Appellant's home state might be read
    as a positive step towards providing protection,  I  was  taken  to  no
    evidence to indicate that there was any willingness on the part of  the
    state to prosecute offences under VAPP.  These findings are  consistent
    with the country background information  as  it  generally  relates  to
    women in Nigeria.  The 2020  Country  Background  Note,  for  instance,
    recites the various laws that could  be  used  to  protect  victims  of
    domestic violence, before concluding [at �16.1.1]:

         "Despite these national efforts, violence against women is  endemic
         in  Nigeria   (Centre   for   Reproductive   Rights,   2016).   The
         discriminatory  attitudes  against  women  and  girls  in  Nigerian
         society contribute to the increase in  violence  against  women  as
         well as harmful practices such as child marriages,  FGM,  widowhood
         rites".

25. I remind myself that the Appellant is a young  woman  who  has  already
    been subject to significant serious harm in Lagos. I am  satisfied,  on
    the totality of the evidence before me, that if  returned  there  today
    she would face very great  difficulty  in  obtaining  state  protection
    against the real risk posed to her by her father / her  wider  paternal
    family. The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that  the  police  regard
    matters such as this as falling within the private domestic sphere, and
    that this reluctance to 'interfere' is one of  the  main  reasons  that
    prosecutions for violence  against  women  are  so  few  in  number  in
    Nigeria.




    Internal Flight

26. The Secretary of State submits that whatever my findings  on  risk  and
    protection, the United Kingdom's international  obligations  under  the
    Refugee Convention are still not engaged by the  facts  in  this  case.
    That is because, it is submitted, the Appellant can avoid serious  harm
    by moving to another location in Nigeria, away from her father/paternal
    family in Lagos and Ananbra State.  Nigeria is  a  large  country  with
    numerous other large cities - in her  submissions  Ms  Jones  gave  the
    example of Abuja - where a single but resourceful  and  educated  young
    woman such as the Appellant could safely establish  herself.  The  CPIN
    (August 2019) states that there is generally freedom of movement in the
    country. The Appellant is not from the conservative Islamic north where
    free movement of a woman might be frowned upon. The Secretary of  State
    accepts that the test here is whether it would in all the circumstances
    be reasonable to expect the Appellant to relocate, or put another  way,
    whether it would be "unduly  harsh"  to  expect  her  to  do  so.   The
    Secretary of State accepts that this requires a wide-ranging evaluative
    exercise. I am not required to assess whether young women  per  se  can
    reasonably be expected to live alone in a city other than  the  one  in
    which they formerly lived,  but whether this young woman can reasonably
    be expected to do so. As such I am required to  identify  the  relevant
    personal characteristics of the  Appellant.   I  must  then  set  these
    traits against the background of the prevailing  country  situation  to
    determine whether the internal relocation alternative would be  'unduly
    harsh'.

    Social Circumstances

27. As already noted the CPIN (August 2017) states that women are  free  to
    move and work within Nigeria without legal restriction. The  CPIN  does
    not say much else about how reasonable it might be to expect them to do
    so. In this I am aided by the expert report of Ms Nwogu.  Her  evidence
    on this point (uncontested by Ms Jones) can be summarised as follows:

      a) Nigeria is a heavily patriarchal society where  the  socio-economic
         activities of women are governed by systems  of  socialization  and
         cultural practice which favour the interests of men above those  of
         women;

      b) At the date that Ms Nwogu wrote her  report  the  official  overall
         unemployment rate was 19.7% but for the reasons summarised  at  (a)
         above for women it is much higher;

      c) A high percentage of those women who are in employment  operate  in
         the informal sector, in low-income generating activities  including
         farm work, prostitution, street hawking, itinerant labour;

      d) The types of work identified at (c) very often expose women to  the
         risk of exploitation and abuse including trafficking;

      e) Whilst education and qualifications play a role in  obtaining  good
         jobs the most significant asset remain  connections.  Nepotism  and
         corruption play a significant role in securing government positions
         and some jobs in the private sector;

      f) Individuals with mental health difficulties are subject  to  severe
         stigma which would further impede their ability to access  the  job
         market;

      g) Nigeria has no social housing. The ability to rent in  the  private
         sector is dependent upon a regular income. The cost of  decent  and
         sanitary  housing  is  prohibitively  high  for   many;   landlords
         routinely require payment of 2 years rent in advance;

      h) Those who cannot afford it populate  the  slum  settlements  dotted
         throughout the big cities;

      i) Because of  the  high  cost  of  housing,  and  the  challenges  in
         obtaining any regular employment, social  networks,  in  particular
         family structures, remain an integral aspect of  "every  Nigerian's
         life". Nigerians choosing to go and live in  another  part  of  the
         country would invariably pick somewhere  where  they  already  have
         connections;

      j) This in turn leads to the congregation of 'non-indigenous' internal
         migrants  in   certain   areas,   as   citizens   coalesce   around
         neighbourhoods already populated by their  family/extended  family/
         ethnic or religious group. These areas are called 'Sabongari'  lit.
         'the place for strangers'.

28. I have already found that the Appellant would not be able to return  to
    either Lagos or Ananmbra states because she would face a real  risk  of
    serious harm there by her father.   It is the Appellant's evidence that
    her mother is presently in Gambia, and her sister is  resident  in  the
    USA. There is no evidence that  the  Appellant  has  any  other  family
    members to whom she could turn for support in Nigeria. These  were  the
    facts that Ms Dirie relied upon in support of her submission  that  the
    Appellant would be relocating without any family support.

29. In her submissions Ms Jones took issue with that  conclusion,  pointing
    out that the Appellant remains on good terms with her mother,  who  has
    once in the past travelled to Nigeria to  offer  her  assistance  (that
    being a reference to the mother's mission in 2009 to take the girls  to
    Gambia). Ms Jones submitted that in those circumstances the Appellant's
    mother could be expected to  return  to  Nigeria  again  and  help  the
    Appellant establish herself on that basis. I am not prepared to base my
    analysis of internal flight on such a speculative solution. I  have  no
    evidence before me to indicate that the  Appellant's  mother  would  be
    willing to return to live in Nigeria, a country  she  herself  fled  in
    fear of serious harm; nor is there any evidence to  indicate  that  she
    would be able to offer any material assistance to the Appellant if  she
    did so (in fact her evidence is that  she  is  living  in  straightened
    circumstances).  More importantly it is incumbent upon me to  determine
    the risk to the Appellant pertaining at the date of this  decision.  At
    the date of this decision the Appellant has no relatives  to  whom  she
    could turn for support in Nigeria.

30. I therefore accept and find as fact that the Appellant is a lone  woman
    who is without any social connections to look to for support.   As  the
    evidence of Ms Nwogu indicates, that is a factor of some  significance,
    because employment opportunities are in Nigeria very often governed  by
    nepotism.  The Appellant is educated to secondary school level, but she
    has no tertiary qualifications and no experience of working in Nigeria,
    a country she left aged 17. As an Igbo indigen  of  Ananbra  state  she
    would be immediately identifiable as a 'stranger'  to  any  prospective
    employer in, for instance, Abuja.   Having  taken  those  factors  into
    account I am satisfied that the prospects  of  the  Appellant  securing
    regular employment are slim. Although she has some education and speaks
    fluent English without any experience or connections she is not  likely
    to be able to find decent employment. It is far more  likely  that  she
    would be left to find work amongst the  other  women  in  the  informal
    sector. As Ms Nwogu explains, even 'legitimate' strands  of  this  work
    such as street hawking can leave such women  vulnerable  to  abuse  and
    exploitation.

31. A further difficulty arises in the Appellant being forced  to  take  on
    such low paid employment: that is that it is difficult to see  how  she
    would be able to  obtain  secure  accommodation.  There  is  no  social
    housing provision. Rent  in  the  private  sector  can  obviously  vary
    depending on the area, but even in a low-income/slum neighbourhood  the
    Appellant  would  still  be  required  to  pay  rent  up  front  for  a
    substantial period. Ms Nwogu's evidence  indicates  that  this  may  be
    possible - just - if the Appellant  is  given  an  AVRP  re-integration
    support package but this would leave her little to live on or  pay  the
    next tranche of rent.  Again, the importance of having family  to  turn
    to assumes great significance in the ability of ordinary  Nigerians  to
    live a relatively normal life.

    Mental Health

32. The evidence relating to the Appellant's mental health covers a  period
    of four years and comes primarily from two sources:, Dr  Bernadette  de
    Jager who prepared a report in May 2017, and Dr Eileen Walsh, who first
    saw her in September 2016 and whose most recent report  is  dated  12th
    January 2020.  No issue was taken with the expertise or conclusions  of
    either.  Due  to  her  status  the  Appellant  has  not  hitherto  been
    registered with a GP, although I was  told  at  the  hearing  that  her
    current solicitors have assisted her in now registering and obtaining a
    referral for counselling.

33. The central diagnoses made by Dr Walsh (and consistent  with  the  2017
    findings of Dr de Jager) is of severe Major Depressive Disorder, severe
    anxiety and  complex  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder.  The  Appellant
    currently lives with the  family  of  an  ex-boyfriend.  She  finds  it
    difficult to leave her home and reports  experiencing  anxiety  attacks
    when she encounters crowded places. Public transport  is  a  particular
    difficulty for her. She sleeps only  a  few  hours  per  night  and  is
    constantly fatigued.  She finds little enjoyment in anything, including
    things like attending church, which she used  to  do.    The  Appellant
    reports findings  relationships  with  others  particularly  difficult,
    feeling "cut-off" and afraid.  She lacks concentration or the energy to
    do anything. Having  assessed  these  symptoms  Dr  Walsh  specifically
    considered whether the Appellant could be feigning them.  In  doing  so
    she applied the guidelines in the Istanbul protocol  as  well  as  best
    practice guidelines for psychologists produced  by  an  academic.   She
    found the Appellant's clinical presentation to be  entirely  consistent
    with her reported history;  that  the  Appellant  showed  no  signs  of
    exaggeration and denied the presence of  multiple  symptoms  tended  to
    support the thesis that her self-reported symptoms were accurate.

34. Dr Walsh opines that  there  are  likely  to  be  several  contributing
    factors to the Appellant's conditions, the two central ones  being  her
    history of  childhood  abuse  and  serious  trauma,  coupled  with  the
    difficult circumstances in which she currently finds herself.  I regard
    that to be a fair assessment. It has already  been  accepted  that  the
    Appellant has  been  subjected  to  significant  abuse  by  her  father
    (including neglect, emotional  abuse,  physical  beatings)  and  sexual
    molestation by a neighbour, all inflicted as  a  child.   She  was,  in
    effect, abandoned by her mother for a key part of her childhood.  Today
    she finds herself in an extremely precarious position, sleeping on  the
    sofa of a family good enough to have her. Her clinical presentation  is
    consistent with this personal history. I accept and find as  fact  that
    the Appellant is  suffering  from  severe  Major  Depressive  Disorder,
    severe  anxiety  and  complex  Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder.    The
    consequences for the Appellant are that she  lives  with  ever  present
    anxiety which inhibits her ability to form relationships  with  others,
    or to go about her 'normal' daily business. An example is given  by  Dr
    Walsh that the Appellant is unable to board a tube train.

35. Asked to comment on the provision for mental health care in Nigeria  Ms
    Nwogu states that there  is  some  state  provision,  but  that  it  is
    woefully inadequate, amounting to  a  fraction  of  the  3.95%  of  the
    national  budget  spent  on  health  overall.   There  are  4  national
    institutes  of  psychiatry,  35  government   hospitals   which   offer
    generalised psychiatric care, 8 regional ones, and a number of  private
    clinics and university departments; these cater  for  a  population  of
    some 190 million of whom the WHO estimates 1 in 4 suffer from some form
    of mental illness.   Ms Nwogu draws on WHO and  NGO  reports,  plus  an
    academic  study  conducted  by  a  Dr  ME  Suleiman  in  2016  for  the
    information she relates in  respect  of  mental  health  provision.  In
    summary her conclusions are that access  to  care  is  very  difficult.
    Although the government announced various policies over the  years  the
    only operative statute in Nigeria remains the 1958  Lunacy  Act,  which
    instead of legislating for treatment, prescribes penalties  and  powers
    for detention and imprisonment. The availability of  drugs  is  patchy.
    What treatment is available  must  be  generally  be  paid  for;  where
    institutions do offer free or low-cost treatment this will  usually  be
    confined to the prescription of older - and cheaper - generic drugs.

36. I am fully prepared to accept that the Appellant is  reasonably  likely
    not to receive any kind of meaningful treatment in Nigeria, but  as  Ms
    Jones  fairly  pointed  out,  since  the  Appellant  is  not  currently
    receiving any medical attention here, there is  nothing  in  the  point
    that she might struggle to receive it there. That does not however mean
    that her conditions are irrelevant.

37. The central point made by Ms Dirie is that whilst the challenges  faced
    by any returnee (see  above)  might  be  surmountable  with  hard-work,
    resilience and the ability to withstand  hardship,  for  the  Appellant
    this is not possible.   The conclusions of  Dr  Walsh,  read  with  the
    evidence of Ms Nwogu, demonstrate that the Appellant would be unable to
    function effectively in Nigerian society. It is likely that the anxiety
    that currently prevents her getting on a tube train  in  London  would,
    faced with the reality of life in a strange  Nigerian  city,  overwhelm
    her. I find that it is reasonably likely that  the  Appellant's  mental
    illnesses would make it all  the  more  difficult  for  her  to  obtain
    employment, housing and to establish a private life  for  herself,  for
    the simple reason that her anxiety and fear inhibit her  from  speaking
    to people, negotiating on her own behalf or indeed functioning  in  the
    'outside world'.

38. This leads to a further issue raised by the report of Ms Nwogu. That is
    that where people are seen to  be  acting  outwith  the  parameters  of
    'normal' behaviour in Nigeria, this is very often interpreted by others
    within the framework of religious or  superstitious  belief.  Ms  Nwogu
    cites a study conducted by two Nigerian doctors  in  2010.  They  found
    that respondents to their survey held strongly negative opinions  about
    the  mentally  unwell:  52%  blamed  witches,  44.2%  attributed   such
    behaviour to demonic possession and 30% believed that such illness were
    visited upon the sufferer as divine  retribution.   These  beliefs  are
    widely held and underpin the severe stigma and  abuse  faced  by  those
    suffering from mental illness.  These fears feed into the  notion  that
    such individuals do not require 'care'  so  much  as  'containment'.  A
    Human Rights Watch study conducted between 2018 and 2019 reported  that
    many  of  the  124  mental  health  in-patients  interviewed   by   its
    researchers  were  found  to  be  living  in  inhuman   and   degrading
    conditions. Most were shackled with heavy iron chains,  and  living  in
    overcrowded  and  unhygienic  conditions.  Ms  Nwogu  states  that  the
    practice of chaining and beating mental health patients  is  widespread
    and well-documented in both state and private institutions.

39. I would add that although this is not directly addressed by Dr Walsh  I
    accept that an additional burden  that  the  Appellant  would  face  in
    trying to establish herself in Nigeria would be her  strong  subjective
    fear of being found by her father. As Ms Nwogu explains,  the  norm  is
    for migrating Nigerians to settle in neighbourhoods populated by others
    from their ethnic group/origins.  As a long woman she would  be  likely
    to attract some attention, particularly  given  her  surname,  and  its
    royal connections. For someone with the Appellant's  mental  conditions
    these matters would, it seems to  me,  assume  some  significance.  She
    would be constantly afraid  of  discovery,  and  all  that  that  might
    entail: living with such fear is not part  of  the  'relatively  normal
    life'  envisaged  when  we  consider  whether  internal  flight  is   a
    reasonable alternative to international protection.

40. Having considered  all  of  that  evidence  I  am  satisfied  that  the
    Appellant's serious mental health  issues  would  present  her  with  a
    significant challenge in attempting to establish  herself  in  Nigeria.
    She is too anxious and traumatised to travel  on  public  transport  or
    establish relationships with other people. It is easy to see  how  this
    behaviour  could  be  interpreted  as  'odd'  and  in  the  context  of
    superstitious belief be viewed with suspicion  and  hostility,  further
    increasing her anxiety and  depression  and  making  it  all  the  more
    difficult for her to cope with the challenges of daily life.




    Conclusions

41. I have found that the Appellant has faced serious harm/past persecution
    for reasons of her membership of a particular social group  (women)  in
    Nigeria. I am satisfied that there are no reasons to believe such  harm
    would not be renewed upon her return to her home area, indeed there  is
    good evidence to show that it would be.

42. I am satisfied that there has been a failure of state protection in the
    past. The evidence demonstrates, to the lower standard of  proof,  that
    state protection for women facing gender-based 'domestic'  violence  in
    Nigeria is  severely  lacking.  There  would  not,  in  the  particular
    circumstances of this case, be a sufficiency of  state  protection  for
    the Appellant.

43. I am satisfied that it would, having regard to the expert  and  medical
    evidence before me, be unduly harsh for the Appellant is  she  were  to
    try and relocate within Nigeria. She  has  no  qualifications  or  work
    experience  to  speak  of,  no  family  support  or  any  other  social
    connections that she could call  upon.  She  is  suffering  from  three
    complex mental health conditions which make it very difficult  for  her
    to function in the 'outside' world and these conditions are  likely  to
    make it all the more difficult for her  to  re-establish  any  kind  of
    'normal' existence in Nigeria. Further it  is  reasonably  likely  that
    these conditions will place her at risk  of  hostility/abuse  from  the
    population at large, and/or inhuman and degrading treatment,  including
    chaining  and  beating  in  a  treatment  centre,  should  one   become
    available.

44. It follows that the Appellant's appeal must be  allowed  on  protection
    grounds, because the Appellant is a refugee.

45. In light of that conclusion, and my findings above,  I  need  not  deal
    separately with human rights, save to note that I regard my findings on
    internal flight in this case determinative of  the  question  posed  by
    276ADE(1)(vi),  whether  the  Appellant  would  face  very  significant
    obstacles in reintegrating in Nigeria.




    Anonymity Order

46. This appeal concerns a claim for international protection.  Having  had
    regard to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008
    and the Presidential Guidance Note No 1 of  2013:  Anonymity  Orders  I
    therefore consider it appropriate to make an  order  in  the  following
    terms:

         "Unless and until  a  tribunal  or  court  directs  otherwise,  the
         Appellant is granted anonymity.  No  report  of  these  proceedings
         shall directly or indirectly identify her  or  any  member  of  her
         family.  This  direction  applies  to,  amongst  others,  both  the
         Appellant  and  the  Respondent.   Failure  to  comply  with   this
         direction could lead to contempt of court proceedings"




    Decisions

47. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal has been set aside for error of
    law.

48. The decision in the appeal is remade as follows:

     "The appeal is allowed on protection grounds.

    The Appellant is not entitled to humanitarian protection because she is
    a refugee.

    The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds".

49. There is an order for anonymity.

                                                             30th March 2020
