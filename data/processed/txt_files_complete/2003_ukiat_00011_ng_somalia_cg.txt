                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

1.    The appellant, who was found by the Adjudicator to  be  a  citizen  of
      Somalia, appeals with leave to the Tribunal against the  determination
      of the Adjudicator, Mr M J Fisher, who dismissed  her  appeal  against
      the respondent's decision issuing directions for her removal from  the
      United Kingdom, having refused asylum.

2.    The hearing before us took place on 10 March 2003.   Mr  T  Walsh  for
      Howells Solicitors appeared on behalf  of  the  appellant,  and  Mr  S
      Walker appeared on behalf of the respondent.

3.     It  is  we  think   sufficiently   clear   from   the   Adjudicator's
      determination  that  he  found  the  appellant  to  be  credible.   He
      therefore accepted, as we have noted above, that she was a citizen  of
      Somalia and that she was a member  of  the  minority  Eyle  clan.   We
      consider that he made a  positive  finding  at  paragraph  18  of  his
      determination that she had been  subjected  to  violent  behaviour  in
      early  1991  including  an  attempt  to  rape  her  and  a   whipping.
      Thereafter she spent some 10 years in  hiding  moving  from  place  to
      place, staying with a family, neighbours of her family.  In  March  or
      April 2001 they decided they could no longer keep her with them.  They
      decided to go to Kenya and she went with  them  on  the  understanding
      that when they arrived she would have to make her own way.  On arrival
      she met and married a man from her own village but a  month  later  he
      said he had arranged for her to leave the country as Kenya was  unsafe
      for illegal immigrants and the plan was for her to go  to  the  United
      Kingdom where she arrived on 20 July 2001.

4.    The Adjudicator had before him the report of an  Anita  Adam  and  the
      UNHCR report on minority groups.  He noted from the latter that  there
      were no indications that the Eyle were at present targeted by the main
      Somali clans although insofar as they might  live  in  unstable  areas
      they could become victims of  armed  conflicts  and  thereby  minority
      status  made  them  vulnerable.   He  also  noted  that  the   Country
      Assessment of the Home Office noted that  persecution  solely  on  the
      basis of clan membership or ethnicity was now very  unlikely  in  most
      areas of Somalia.  The Human Rights Overview indicated  that  much  of
      the countryside of Somalia was considered safe and basic law and order
      was in fact the norm in most locations.

5.    Before us Mr Walker argued that the Adjudicator in this  paragraph  of
      his determination had taken account of the objective  evidence  before
      him and found that the claim was  not  objectively  well-founded.   He
      referred  us  to  the  specific  paragraph  of  the  Minority   Report
      concerning the Eyle and also the Bantu of whom the  Eyle  are  a  sub-
      group.  He accepted that the appellant would  go  back  alone  without
      family support since the whereabouts of her  family  was  unknown  and
      there is no indication as to the whereabouts of her husband  whom  she
      had last seen in Kenya.  He accepted that it seemed she would have  to
      go to a camp as an internally displaced person and  he  accepted  that
      the camp conditions were not ideal for unaccompanied women.

6.    Mr Walsh took us in some detail to his bundle, and  in  particular  to
      the Commission on Human Rights report of 31 December 2002 being the UN
      report of an independent expert concerning the situation in Somalia in
      the field of human rights.

7.    Among other things this report indicates that violence  against  women
      and girls, including rape, is  reportedly  not  uncommon  in  Somalia,
      particularly in camps for displaced  persons  and  against  women  and
      girls of rival clans and those of minority groups.  It  is  also  said
      that the minority groups, and there is reference among others  to  the
      Eyle, continue to live in  conditions  of  great  poverty  and  suffer
      numerous forms of discrimination and exclusion.  They  are  considered
      to be inferior without full rights, hence their low  social,  economic
      and political status.  Credible reports indicated  that  the  dominant
      Somali groups believe that members of the minorities are mere chattels
      and their forefathers were slaves and they are only allowed to work in
      menial jobs.  Displacement is said to be a serious problem in  Somalia
      and  it  is  said  that  some  350,000  of  the  country's  7  million
      inhabitants are  internally  displaced  persons  and  they  constitute
      nearly half of the estimated 750,000 Somalis who live in  a  state  of
      chronic humanitarian need.   Many  internally  displaced  persons  are
      persons of minority groups.   An  encampment  visited  had  very  poor
      conditions, perhaps even to  a  degree  unfit  for  human  habitation.
      There were allegations of sexual assault by local  militia  men.   The
      United States State Department report indicates at pages 58 to  59  of
      the bundle that members of minority groups continue to be subjected to
      killings, harassment, intimidation and abuse by armed  gunmen  of  all
      affiliations.

8.    Mr Walsh made the point to us that the reference at paragraph 5.50  of
      the October 2002 Somalia Country Assessment that persecution solely on
      the basis of clan membership or ethnicity is now very unlikely in most
      areas of Somalia is based on references in the late  1990s  and  could
      not therefore be said to  be  up  to  date.   There  is  reference  at
      paragraph 5.49 to Amnesty  International  regarding  certain  minority
      groups including the Bantu as vulnerable.  In September 2000  a  Joint
      British and Danish Fact Finding Mission report on minority  groups  in
      Somalia, the Eyle are said to have been scattered by  the  civil  war.
      They are said to be considered dirty creatures by the "noble"  Somali.
      Both the Hawiye and the Digil despise them.

9.    It would seem therefore to  be  the  case  that  the  appellant  would
      return to Somalia facing vulnerability on the basis of her  membership
      of a minority despised sub-clan, as a  woman,  and  as  an  internally
      displaced person.  It must we think be accepted that she  has  had  no
      contact with her family for more than 10 years, and  the  location  of
      her husband is unknown.  In the light of  the  Adjudicator's  positive
      credibility findings and the absence of any substantial  challenge  to
      the aspects of the objective  evidence  emphasised  before  us  by  Mr
      Walsh, we consider that, bearing in mind the  low  standard  of  proof
      appropriate in asylum and human rights cases, that the  appellant  has
      made out her claim.  We accept that as a woman member of the Eyle sub-
      group she would be at significant risk,  as  an  internally  displaced
      person in a camp, on  the  one  hand  of  persecution  on  account  of
      membership of that sub-group, albeit that that might only be an aspect
      of the reasons behind the problems she would  suffer,  but  that  more
      particularly there is a real risk that because of  the  three  factors
      that we have identified above that her Article 3 rights  would  be  at
      real risk of being breached  on  return  as  an  internally  displaced
      person living in a camp in Somalia.

10.   We therefore allow her appeal.
