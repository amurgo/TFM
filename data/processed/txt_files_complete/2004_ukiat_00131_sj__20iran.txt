                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

Before us the  appellant  was  represented  by  Mr  L  Jackson  of  Counsel
instructed by Browell  Smith  &  Co,  solicitors  and  the  respondent  was
represented by Mr L Parker, a Home Office Presenting Officer.

The appellant is a citizen of Iran.  He was born on 11 September  1976  and
so is now 26 years old.  He appeals the decision of an Adjudicator, Mr I  F
MacDonald, who in a determination promulgated on 2 June 2003 dismissed  the
appellant's appeal against the decision of the Secretary of State  that  he
was not entitled to Refugee Status and that removing him  from  the  United
Kingdom was not contrary to his rights under  the  European  Convention  on
human rights.

The grounds of appeal are extensive.  In fact they really are too long  but
they do raise a point of central concern.  They complain about the  conduct
of the interpreter.  It is quite plain that  the  interpreter's  competence
was challenged during the hearing by a person instructed by the  appellant.
It is also plain that the  Adjudicator  went  to  considerable  efforts  to
maintain order in his hearing room and protect the interpreter  from  being
criticised in an intimidating and unfair way.

We have evidence presented in a proper form from Counsel at the hearing and
the interpreter who was instructed by the appellant to check on the quality
of the interpreter provided by the Appellate Authority.  It is  clear  from
reading these statements that the interpreter  responded  to  criticism  by
lowering her voice so that her interpretation could not be  heard.   Whilst
we have a great deal of sympathy for the interpreter taking this course  it
was wrong.  Hearings in the Appellate Authority are almost always conducted
in public and that means they have to be conducted in a way that members of
the public and people with a particular interest in the case can understand
what is happening.  By permitting the interpreter to interpret too  quietly
for other people to hear the Adjudicator erred.

Justice must be seen to be done and the only way this can  be  remedied  is
for the appeal to be heard again by a different Adjudicator.

We allow the appeal to the extent we direct that it be heard  again  by  an
Adjudicator other than Mr I F MacDonald.  We also direct that the Appellate
authority  provide  a  different  interpreter.   We  assume  the  Appellate
Authority will have records of the  interpreter  used  when  the  case  was
before Mr MacDonald.  We have not been able to find that interpreter's name
easily on the papers in front of us.

We explained to the appellant at the hearing that although we do  not  make
any direction about this it would be sensible if he was not assisted at the
next hearing by the same person who  criticised  the  interpreter  on  this
occasion.
