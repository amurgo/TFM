For the claimant: Mr A Jafar, instructed by Lee Valley Solicitors
For the appellant:     Ms A Everett, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of the Secretary of State against  the  decision  of
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Peart  promulgated  17.2.15,  allowing  on
    private life grounds the claimant's appeal against the decision of  the
    Secretary of State, dated 4.7.14, to refuse  his  application  made  on
    29.4.14 for leave to remain in the UK on grounds of private life.   The
    Judge heard the appeal on 10.2.15.

 2. First-tier Tribunal Judge  Lambert  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    25.4.15.

 3. Thus the matter came before me on 5.6.15 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

Error of Law

 4. For the reasons set out herein, I find that there was an error  of  law
    in the making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal such that  the
    determination of Judge Peart should be set aside and remade. I do so by
    dismissing the appeal.

 5. It is evident that Judge Peart either misunderstood or  lost  sight  of
    the nature of the application made by the claimant, being caught up  in
    the issue arising from the refusal decision as to whether the appellant
    had any right of appeal.

 6. On 9.4.11 the claimant entered the UK with leave as a Tier 4  (General)
    student migrant until 30.4.14. On 8.5.13 the Secretary of  State  wrote
    to him, curtailing his leave to 7.7.13,  because  the  licence  of  his
    educational sponsor, Stratford College London, was revoked on  24.1.13.
    He was expected to leave the UK or submit a  fresh  application  before
    the expiry of the curtailed leave. The claimant claimed that he did not
    receive the curtailment letter. Nevertheless, he made a new application
    within the original period of leave, but only for leave  to  remain  on
    the basis of private life, not as a student.

 7. The Secretary of State refused  his  application,  considering  in  the
    process that as his leave had expired (by reason of the curtailment) he
    had no right  of  appeal,  as  the  decision  was  not  an  immigration
    decision.

 8. Judge Peart set out at length why the  Secretary  of  State  failed  to
    discharge the burden of demonstrating that the  claimant  had  received
    the curtailment letter.

 9. In her grounds of application for permission to appeal the Secretary of
    State accepts that this finding was open to the judge on the facts  and
    no challenge is raised in respect of it.

10. It follows that if the Secretary of State  could  not  prove  that  the
    curtailment letter had been received by the appellant, the  curtailment
    decision was not effective and his leave continued to  run  its  course
    until 30.4.14. Given that he made a new application on 29.4.14,  within
    that period of extant leave, he had  a  right  of  appeal  against  the
    decision of 4.7.14.

11. However, Judge Peart failed to recognise that  on  the  chronology  the
    claimant's original student leave expired on 30.4.14. Even  though  the
    claimant was apparently unaware of the  purported  curtailment  of  his
    leave, he made no new application for leave to remain as a student. The
    application he in fact made on 29.4.14, the day before  the  expiry  of
    his original student leave, was for  leave  to  remain  in  the  UK  on
    grounds of private life, which is clearly stated in the refusal  letter
    dated 4.7.14. He never sought leave to remain further as a student.

12. It follows that the judge's finding at �10 that the claimant should  be
    given the opportunity to find another sponsor was neither necessary nor
    justified. It is clear  from  �4  of  the  decision  that  the  judge's
    attention  focused  solely  on  the  curtailment  letter,   which   was
    incidental to the claimant's application and the refusal decision under
    appeal. The judge failed entirely to deal with the appeal  against  the
    Secretary of State's decision on the application actually made  by  the
    claimant, namely leave to remain on the  basis  of  private  life.  The
    judge failed to address the issue of private life.

13. In the circumstances  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  was
    entirely flawed, failing to address the issue in the appeal,  and  must
    be set aside and remade. I made that finding at the hearing  before  me
    and invited further submissions as to the remaking of the decision.

14. For the claimant, Mr Jafar explained that he  wanted  to  remain  as  a
    student and had approached  other  colleges,  but  could  not  get  any
    sponsorship as he could not produce his diploma from Stratford College,
    as they demanded �2,000 from him.

15. The primary reason for refusal of the claimant's application for  leave
    to remain on the basis of private  life  is  set  out  in  the  refusal
    decision dated 4.7.14. The claimant could not meet the requirements  of
    paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules. He had only been in  the  UK
    since 2011 and had spent the vast majority of his 32 years in Pakistan.
    The Secretary of State considered that he could not demonstrate that he
    had  lost  all  ties,  including  social,  cultural  and  family,  with
    Pakistan. That was the  correct  test  at  the  date  of  decision.  As
    paragraph 276ADE is presently drafted, the claimant has to  demonstrate
    that there would be very significant obstacles to his integration  into
    Pakistan.  There  was  nothing  before  the  First-tier   Tribunal   to
    demonstrate  that  the  claimant  met  either  version   of   paragraph
    276ADE(1)(vi). It was not submitted to me that the claimant could  meet
    the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

16. The Secretary of State also found that there  were  no  exceptional  or
    compelling circumstances insufficiently recognised in  the  Immigration
    Rules to grant leave to remain in the UK outside the Rules on the basis
    of article 8 ECHR, on the basis that it would be unjustifiably harsh to
    require him to leave the UK.  Whilst  I  have  some  sympathy  for  the
    claimant's plight, on  the  assumption  that  he  has  been  a  genuine
    student, given that he did not make an application for leave to  remain
    as a student, those matters are  not  relevant  to  the  issue  in  the
    appeal, being his application for leave  to  remain  on  the  basis  of
    private life. Since he effectively had extant leave, it was open to him
    to make a student leave application prior to the expiry of  that  leave
    on 30.4.14.

17. The claimant's private life was developed whilst he was a  student.  In
    Nasim and others  (article  8)  [2014]  UKUT  00025  (IAC),  the  Upper
    Tribunal considered whether the hypothetical  removal  of  the  22  PBS
    claimants, pursuant to the decision to  refuse  to  vary  leave,  would
    violate the UK's obligations under article 8  ECHR.  Whilst  each  case
    must  be  determined  on  its  merits,  the  Tribunal  noted  that  the
    judgements of the Supreme Court in Patel and Others v SSHD [2013]  UKSC
    72, "serve to re-focus attention on the nature and purpose of article 8
    of the ECHR and, in particular, to  recognise  that  article's  limited
    utility in private life cases that are far removed from the  protection
    of an individual's moral and physical integrity." There was nothing  in
    this case to suggest that the decision amounted to a grave interference
    with the claimant's moral and physical integrity.

18. Further, by reason of section 117B(5) of the 2002  Act,  little  weight
    should be accorded  in  any  article  8  ECHR  proportionality  balance
    exercise to a private life established by a person at a time  when  the
    person's immigration status is  precarious.  As  recently  held  in  AM
    (s117B) Malawi [2015] UKUT 0260 (IAC) a person's immigration status  is
    precarious if their continued presence in the UK will be dependent upon
    their obtaining a further grant of leave. Section 117B(1) also provides
    that the maintenance of effective immigration control is in the  public
    interest. The claimant had no legitimate expectation of being  able  to
    remain in the UK beyond his period of study. If he did  not  intend  to
    continue to study in the UK, as evidenced by his failure to  apply  for
    further leave to remain as  a  student,  he  should  have  returned  to
    Pakistan. He had no legitimate expectation of being able to  remain  in
    the UK solely by reason of the fact that he had been here as a  student
    since 2011. The application as made was doomed to failure on the  facts
    of this case and I have no hesitation in dismissing the appeal  on  all
    grounds.

Conclusions:

19. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law such that the decision  should  be
    set aside.

                    I set aside the decision.

                    I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it on
                    both immigration and human rights grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did not make an order pursuant to rule 45(4)(i) of the  Asylum  and
Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005.
Given the circumstances, I make no anonymity order.


Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a  fee  award
(rule 23A (costs) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal  (Procedure)  Rules
2005 and section 12(4)(a) of  the  Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement  Act
2007).

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
