For the Appellant:     Mr S Winter, Advocate, instructed by A J Bradley &
Co, Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr A Govan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant appeals against a decision by First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Doyle, promulgated on 5 December 2019.

 2. The judge was told that the appellant refused to  leave  the  detention
    centre where he was held in order to attend the hearing.  As  might  be
    have been expected, the judge declined to adjourn.

 3. Medical records have been produced.  It emerges that the appellant  was
    unable to attend because he was unwell.

 4. There was some miscommunication.  It is irrelevant who is to blame.

 5. Through no faut of the judge, there has been procedural unfairness.

 6. The decision of the FtT is set aside. It stands only  as  a  record  of
    what was said at the hearing.

 7. The nature of the case is such that it is appropriate under section  12
    of the 2007 Act, and under Practice Statement 7.2, to remit to the  FtT
    for an entirely fresh hearing.

 8. The member(s) of the FtT chosen to consider the case are not to include
    Judge Doyle.

 9. No anonymity direction has been requested or made.
