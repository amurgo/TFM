Representation

For the appellant:     Mr. A. Fisher, counsel, instructed by Haggerston
                       Legal Services Ltd.
For the Respondent:    Mr. J. Morris

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is an appeal against the decision of an adjudicator, Mr. C. Rushton,
   sitting at Salford on 7 February, dismissing the appeal of a  citizen  of
   Sierra Leone against refusal of leave to  enter.  Our  decision  will  be
   reported on our general view of risk from the RUF  [Revolutionary  United
   Front]. It may be cited as the case of the Night-walker of Freetown.


2. Leave was given on rather comprehensive terms. The appellant's  case  was
   that he had remained in hiding in Sierra Leone between 1997 and 2002;  at
   one point this was modified to the slightly less  extreme  form  that  he
   remained indoors only during daylight hours. The  situation  which  faced
   him when he came out is dealt with at paragraph 7:


   The British forces on their arrival, took control of the Western area  of
   Freetown known as Aberdeen and the appellant went to live there. Although
   he said in his evidence that the  area  was  under  the  control  of  the
   British army, he also said there was no control anywhere and he  did  not
   feel safe. He said that whilst at a football match in Aberdeen in  August
   2002, he was threatened by a former rebel who said that he knew all about
   him and that he would take care of him which the appellant said was  used
   in the area to mean that a person would be killed.


   The appellant thereupon took steps to leave the country which he  did  on
   28 August 2002 making a short stop in Belgium  and  claiming  on  arrival
   here on 29 August.


3. The 'former rebel' means  a  member  of  the  RUF  [Revolutionary  United
   Front] whose history is given in the CIPU report at  paragraphs  6.55  to
   6.57. At 6.56 we are told of the ceasefire signed  between  the  RUF  and
   Sierra Leone government on 10 November 2000. 6.57 reads as follows:

   Prior to the elections in May 2002 all the militia and rebel groups  were
   to disarm. The UN reported that this had been achieved in  January  2002,
   with over 40,000 rebel and  government  militia  forces  being  disarmed.
   Funds have also been provided to reintegrate members of  such  groups  in
   society. The RUF still has influence  within  the  community  and  it  is
   likely that all groups have retained weapons caches. RUF has  reorganised
   as a political party and it contested parliamentary elections and fielded
   a Presidential candidate.


4. The issues before us were first, whether there was any  real  risk  still
   to this appellant, or to anybody else from the RUF; second, whether there
   was any  evidence  that  the  authorities  would  not  provide  effective
   protection against any such risk  as  there  might  be.  Mr.  Morris  has
   referred us to a decision of the Tribunal, Tarazid-Tarawali [2002]  UKIAT
   04433, heard as long ago as 10 September 2002 in which the Tribunal  (Dr.
   Storey and Mr. Mackey, Vice Presidents) said as follows:

   6.       The great difficulty for the appellant  in  this  case  is  that
       whatever may have been the position  at  the  date  of  hearing,  the
       latest  objective  country  material  before  the  Tribunal  did  not
       indicate the RUF any longer posed a serious threat in  Freetown.  The
       appellant in this case came from Freetown. There was no  evidence  to
       indicate those RUF rebels  who  had  targeted  her  and  her  husband
       previously would be in the capital or that if they  were  they  would
       any longer be in a position to inflict serious harm against which the
       authorities could not protect her.


   The Tribunal deal with counsel's submissions but conclude:


   7. ... There is no evidence to show that the RUF rebels any longer have a
       significant presence in Freetown or that any  significant  number  of
       RUF members there are armed. ...


5. Before us, Mr. Fisher has relied first  on  the  statement  in  the  CIPU
   report which we have quoted, about the RUF still having influence  within
   the community, then on various other pieces  of  evidence.  There  is  an
   Internet news item from 'allAfrica.com'  dated  20  October  2003,  about
   witnesses in the forthcoming international tribunal on Sierra Leone being
   taken to Canada for their own protection. Those persons may  well  be  at
   some obvious risk if they are to relate  serious  atrocities  which  have
   taken place during the course of the civil war. We  do  not  think  their
   situation sheds any light on this appellant's.


6. There is another  article  from  the  same  source  with  the  same  date
   referring to a mob which gathered and attacked Dr. Ahmadu T. Fadlu  Deen,
   the chairman of the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, and we are  told,  also
   the chairman of the Sierra Leone Electoral Commission. It does not appear
   exactly what happened to this gentleman, who is said to have been  blamed
   for corruptly procuring the election of Dr. Kabbah. Clearly there  was  a
   serious current feeling of resentment  against  him  on  a  part  of  the
   populace as a whole. The police may or may not have  given  him  all  the
   protection that they could; but as the article makes clear, there was  an
   explosive situation which suddenly brewed up, and again, we do not  think
   that has anything to say about the general  situation  in  Sierra  Leone.
   There is speculation in a further item, from a Pakistani officer  serving
   there, that the 'ongoing Civil  War  in  Liberia  had  the  potential  of
   sending tremors to neighbouring Sierra Leone.' Again, this has nothing to
   say about the current situation in Sierra Leone.

7. There are further passages from the CIPU report to  which  we  have  been
   referred about delays in the judicial system and lack of  legal  training
   for police prosecutors. Frankly, we regard reliance on all these items as
   a process of  clutching  straws  on  behalf  of  this  appellant.  It  is
   perfectly clear that the RUF have joined the political process in  Sierra
   Leone, and there  is  nothing  by  way  of  a  real  risk  of  Convention
   persecution or ill-treatment from them as an organization. If there is  a
   maverick element, as represented by the person at the football  match  in
   August 2002, there is nothing to suggest that such a person  would  cause
   trouble on any scale with which the police or other authorities would  be
   unable to deal. We see no real risk on return for this appellant, even if
   his past history were to be accepted, and his appeal is dismissed.


                                                                       [pic]

                                                                  (chairman)
