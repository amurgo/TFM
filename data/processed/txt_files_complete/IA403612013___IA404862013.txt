Representation:
For the Appellants: Mr A Eaton, instructed by Turpin & Miller Solicitors
For the Respondent: Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The first appellant, a national of India, appealed  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal against the decision of the Secretary of State to  refuse  his
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General)  Student  Migrant
    under the Points Based System and to remove him from the UK. The second
    appellant, the first appellant's spouse, appealed against  the  refusal
    of her application for leave  to  remain  as  a  dependant.  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Britton dismissed the appeals  and  the  appellants  now
    appeal with permission to this Tribunal.

 2. The background to this appeal is that on  6  December  2012  the  first
    appellant applied for leave  to  remain  to  study  at  Thames  College
    Berkshire. According to his application form his submitted the CAS form
    and a bank statement. The respondent wrote to the appellant on 24  June
    2013 to inform him that on 11  June  2013  the  UKBA  had  revoked  the
    licence of Thames College Berkshire and gave him a  60  day  period  in
    which to withdraw the application and submit a fresh application or  to
    obtain a new CAS for a course at a licensed college and  to  submit  an
    application to vary the grounds of appeal of his original  application.
    However the college's licence  was  reinstated  on  9  July  2013.  The
    appellant submitted a further bank statement to the respondent dated  3
    August 2013.

 3. The respondent refused the application on  17  September  2013  on  the
    basis that the appellant had not achieved the required  10  points  for
    maintenance. According to the Reasons for Refusal letter  the appellant
    was required to show that he had the  required  maintenance  amount  of
    �10,800 plus any outstanding course fees for  the  first  year  of  his
    course for a period of 28 days. The respondent  referred  to  the  bank
    statement dated 3 August 2013 which  showed  funds  of  330,747  Indian
    Rupees  (�3,347.85)  and  concluded  that   the   appellant   had   not
    demonstrated that he had the required level of funds over the specified
    28 day period.

 4. The First-tier Tribunal Judge decided that  when  the  appellant  first
    submitted his application he produced  evidence  of  �3,347.85  in  his
    Indian bank account and that the letter he produced from his father-in-
    law, dated 2 October 2013, post dated the date of refusal and could not
    therefore be considered.

 5. The appellant applied for permission to appeal to the  Upper  Tribunal.
    This application  was  refused  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal  and,  on
    renewal, by the Upper Tribunal.  However  the  decision  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal to refused permission was set aside and permission  to  appeal
    was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson on 2 October 2014.

 6. The grounds  of  appeal  contend  that  the  appellant  submitted  bank
    statements in  December  2012  which  demonstrated  that  he  held  the
    equivalent of �10,000 for the required 28  day  period  prior  to  that
    application. It  was  submitted  that  the  respondent  returned  those
    documents to the appellant in June 2013 when he was  advised  that  the
    sponsor's licence had been withdrawn. It is contended  that  the  Judge
    erred in failing to consider the evidence as to the correct period  and
    for failing to ask the appellant,  who  was  unrepresented  before  the
    First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  because  his  representatives   had   been
    intervened,  for  the  documents  submitted  with  the  December   2012
    application.

 7. In granting permission to appeal Upper Tribunal Judge Dawson noted that
    it was not clear what evidence was before the  First-tier  Tribunal  or
    referred to at the hearing. The parties were directed to file with  the
    Tribunal any documentary evidence upon which reliance  is  placed.  The
    appellant's solicitors submitted a bundle of documents  including  bank
    statements from December 2012 which were said to have been returned  by
    the respondent to the appellant in June 2013.

Error of law

 8. I accept on the  basis  of  the  chronology  set  out  above  that  the
    respondent, and then the First-tier Tribunal  Judge,  were  obliged  to
    consider the circumstances as at the date  of  the  application  which,
    according to the Reasons for Refusal letter, was 6  December  2012.  Mr
    Melvin accepted that the appellant had to demonstrate that he  met  the
    requirements at the date of the original application.

 9. According to paragraph 1A of Appendix C of the  Immigration  Rules  the
    appellant was required to demonstrate that he had  the  required  funds
    for a consecutive period of 28 days at the  date  of  the  application.
    Although the sponsor's licence was withdrawn it was reinstated within a
    short period of time and the appellant did not obtain or submit  a  new
    CAS.

10. The respondent clearly erred in  the  Reasons  for  Refusal  letter  in
    considering the  bank  statement  of  3  August  2013.  The  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge did not specifically identify  this  issue.  However  he
    says at paragraph 13 of  the  determination  that  when  the  appellant
    submitted his application "he produced evidence  of  �3,347.85  in  his
    Indian Bank account, which does not demonstrate the [required] level of
    funds...". This appears to refer to the August 2013 bank statement. The
    First-tier Tribunal  Judge  does  not  refer  to  any  other  financial
    evidence apart from a letter dated 2 October 2013 from the  appellant's
    father-in-law. It is not therefore clear that any further evidence  was
    before him.

11. I am satisfied  that  the  financial  evidence  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal Judge related to August 2013. The appellant was  unrepresented
    at the hearing and it seems from the Reasons for Refusal  letter  which
    referred to the August 2013 statement and the notice of  appeal,  which
    included further financial documents dating from October 2013, that the
    appellant and those advising him failed to appreciate that the relevant
    period for the purposes of this application was the period of  28  days
    prior to the application on de on 6 December 2012. Whilst the Judge was
    clearly not aware that it was asserted that such evidence  existed,  he
    still erred in considering the August 2013 bank statement as it related
    to the wrong period.

12. The question is whether  this  is  a  material  error.  Had  the  Judge
    referred to  the  correct  period  and  said  that  the  appellant  had
    submitted no evidence to cover it then his  error  may  not  have  been
    material. However the appellant was unrepresented  and  had  the  Judge
    raised the issue as to the correct period to be considered I cannot  be
    certain that the appellant would not have been able to deal with it  or
    to have produced some evidence or to  have  sought  an  adjournment  to
    obtain any evidence relating to that period. In these  circumstances  I
    conclude that the  error  was  material.  I  therefore  set  aside  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal Judge and remake it.

Remaking the decision

13. In their bundle  dated  13  October  2014  the  appellant's  solicitors
    submitted a letter from the Punjab National bank dated 1 December 2012,
    a print out from the Punjab National bank dated 1 December 2012  and  a
    bank statement dated  1  December  2012.  It  is  asserted  that  these
    documents were sent to the respondent with the original application and
    returned in June 2013. Mr Melvin submitted that it is not clear  if  or
    when these documents were put before the respondent. Mr Eaton submitted
    that they are specified in the  appeal  form  however  the  notices  of
    appeal list the documents included and  these  all  date  from  October
    2013. Mr Melvin submitted that there is no evidence that the  documents
    included in the October 2014 bundle were before the respondent  or  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge. He submitted that there is nothing  to  show
    that these documents have been verified. He further submitted that  any
    contention that the appellant was wrongly advised was not an issue  for
    the Tribunal.

14. Mr Eaton submitted that the only issue was whether  the  December  2012
    documents  were  submitted  with  the  December  2012  application.  He
    submitted that  it  is  clear  from  the  application  form  that  bank
    statements were submitted and that it is reasonable  to  conclude  that
    the bank documents dated 1 December 2012 were  the  documents  referred
    to. I accept that the  application  form  submitted  in  December  2012
    states that a bank statement was included. However no copy is with  the
    application form and no further details were provided on the form.

15. Mr Eaton submitted that  it  is  reasonable  to  infer  that  the  bank
    documents provided in the bundle of October 2014 are those referred  to
    in the application form. This may be so but I have  reservations  about
    the documents in that bundle. Firstly they are copies and not originals
    and secondly the copies before me are mis-sized as a  result  of  which
    some of the details are not visible. In these circumstances I am unable
    with confidence to remake the decision on the  basis  of  the  evidence
    before me. I do not consider that a First-tier Tribunal Judge would  be
    any better placed  than  me  to  remake  the  decision  without  better
    evidence as to the financial circumstances of the appellant at the date
    of the application and as to what was submitted to  the  respondent.  I
    note Mr Melvin's' submission that there is no evidence  that  the  bank
    statements  submitted  have  been  considered  or   verified   by   the
    respondent. I  note  that  the  respondent  never  considered  whatever
    documents were submitted with the December  2012  application.  I  also
    take account of the fact that the  appellant's  former  representatives
    have been intervened  and  that  the  best  evidence  as  to  what  was
    submitted in December 2012 may week be with the respondent. I also take
    account of the fact that the respondent did not apply  the  Immigration
    Rules properly in the  decision  dated  17  September  2013  in  taking
    account of evidence relating to 2013 rather than December  2012.  I  am
    satisfied that the proper approach in the circumstances of this case is
    to return the application to the respondent to make a decision based on
    the circumstances at the date of the application in accordance with the
    Immigration Rules.

Conclusion:

The making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did  involve  the
making of an error on point of law.

I set the decision aside and remake it by allowing it  only  to  the  extent
that the application remains outstanding before the Secretary of State.
