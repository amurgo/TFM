                            DECISION AND REASONS



 1. The appellant, SM, date of birth [ ] 1997, is a citizen of Albania.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Green promulgated 4.5.16, dismissing on all grounds his appeal  against
    the decision of the Secretary of State, dated 15.7.15,  to  refuse  his
    asylum, humanitarian protection, and human rights claims.

 3. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Saffer  granted  permission  to  appeal  on
    1.6.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 5.7.16 as  an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.



Error of Law

 5. In the first instance I have to determine whether or not there  was  an
    error of law in the making of the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    such that the decision of Judge Green should be set aside.

 6. The relevant background can  be  briefly  summarised  as  follows.  The
    appellant had an abusive, alcoholic father and  the  appellant  had  to
    work from a young age to support the family. Whilst the family  was  in
    Turkey between 2012 and 2013 the appellant and his sister were  put  to
    work in a factory. Shortly  after  returning  to  Albania,  his  father
    disappeared following an incident when two men came to the home looking
    for him. They returned after his father's disappearance  and  told  the
    appellant's mother that the father owed them money and that they  would
    kidnap the appellant if that money was not  paid.  The  appellant  then
    left Albania. He  fears  that  if  returned  to  Albania  he  would  be
    kidnapped by his father's creditors.  He  is  also  frightened  of  his
    father because he was forced to work at a young age.

 7. The appellant's account was rejected by the Secretary of State, for the
    various reasons set out in the refusal decision.

 8. In a careful and detailed decision Judge Green set out the evidence and
    from �46 the findings of fact. Although then 19 years of age, the judge
    accepted that the appellant is a vulnerable young man who suffers  from
    mental illness, mild depression and an adjustment disorder.  The  judge
    accepted that he had suffered domestic abuse at the hands of his father
    and that he fears his father. It was accepted that  the  father  is  an
    alcoholic who may have run up debts. In Turkey the appellant was forced
    into hard work at age 14, earning money  to  support  the  family.  The
    judge accepted as plausible that after the family returned  to  Albania
    the appellant's father disappeared and  creditors  visited  the  family
    home. However, the judge did not accept that  he  had  been  threatened
    with kidnap and even if he had it had not  been  carried  out.  It  was
    accepted that the appellant fears his father, but  as  his  father  now
    lives in Germany there is no reason to believe that he would come  into
    contact with him on the appellant's return to Albania.  The  judge  did
    not accept that the appellant had a  justified  fear  of  his  father's
    creditors. Notwithstanding the expert report of Dr Senerdem, the  judge
    found it not likely that Kanun liability for his father's  debts  would
    pass to the appellant whilst his father is living. In relation to  this
    issue, the judge noted that the appellant's father and brother have not
    been threatened by the creditors.

 9. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Saffer found it  arguable  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge materially erred by not  giving  adequate
    reasons for finding that the appellant was not at risk from the  people
    to whom his father owed a debt.

10. The Rule 24 reply, dated 16.6.16, submits that the judge had regard  to
    all the evidence and was entitled to find the appellant would not be at
    risk on return. The judge considered the expert material and  the  fact
    that none of the appellant's male paternal family members had faced any
    problems, despite living in close proximity to the  appellant's  family
    home. The judge also gave consideration to  protection  available  from
    state authorities and background material.

11. It is also submitted that the judge had regard to the medical evidence,
    including the oral evidence as to the purported risk of suicide and was
    entitled to reach the conclusions made, considering all the evidence in
    the round and it was not necessary for the judge to  set  the  evidence
    out again in full.

12. However, the judge's assessment of the expert evidence was that neither
    of the witnesses, Ms Pagett or Mr Smit considered the appellant  to  be
    at risk of suicide.

13. The first ground of appeal (A) as to  whether  the  father's  creditors
    threatened to kidnap the appellant is no more than a disagreement  with
    the findings of the judge. I am satisfied that  reasons  were  provided
    for the judge's conclusion, after assessing all the  evidence  together
    in the round. At �31 the judge gave reasons for doubting Dr  Senerdem's
    report and the applicability of the information about  blood  feuds  to
    debts, pointing out the expert's concession that there is  no  explicit
    clause in the Kanun code to suggest that  the  father's  debts  can  be
    transferred to male offspring when the father is still alive, which  is
    an  accepted  fact.  The  judge  also  relied  on  the  fact  that  the
    appellant's father, uncle and brothers are still  alive.  The  brothers
    had not been threatened, as the judge found  at  �53.  The  judge  also
    referenced in this regard the case of Fornah, in which it was held that
    where some members of a family face persecution, but  not  others,  the
    issue of causation will need to be  closely  scrutinised.  At  �53  the
    judge found that this issue of causation had not been overcome. In  the
    circumstances, the conclusion was open to the judge and I find no error
    of law in this ground of appeal when the decision is read as a whole.

14. In my view, the second ground of appeal (B) has  no  merit.  As  stated
    above, the Judge accepted that in  order  to  support  the  family  the
    appellant and his sister were sent out to work in a factory whilst  the
    family was living in Turkey, at which time he was only 14 years of age.
    It was also accepted that the appellant  is  a  vulnerable  young  man.
    However, this is not the same as being trafficked for forced labour and
    the appellant is now 19 years of age. His father lives in  Germany  and
    the judge found that he would have nothing to fear from his  father  on
    his return to Albania. There is no reasonable evidence that because  of
    his experiences in Turkey in being forced to work at a young age, he is
    at any real risk of trafficking on return to Albania. There is woefully
    inadequate information to demonstrate such a risk and in my  view  this
    ground of appeal is a contrivance with no real merit and even if it had
    been specifically addressed in the decision, it is inevitable that  the
    judge would have had to conclude that there was no such risk.

15. The third ground of appeal (C) relates to the judge's  finding  at  �53
    that the appellant failed to make out that he is a member of a PSG. The
    judge, as noted above, considered the factual claim.  It  was  accepted
    that visits were made to the family home about the father's debts,  but
    the judge did not accept that he was threatened as claimed. Mr Draycott
    relies on the family connection between the act of persecution  by  the
    threat and the appellant's family, suggesting that is sufficient,  even
    if it is not the only or primary ground on which the appellant  relies.
    I am satisfied that the judge adequately addressed this issue and  that
    the conclusion that the appellant is not a member of a PSG is one  open
    to the judge and for which cogent reasoning has been provided. There is
    no error of law in the judge's assessment of this issue.

16. The fourth ground (D) relates to sufficiency of protection on return to
    Albania, in reliance on EH (blood feuds) Albania CG [2012]  UKUT  00348
    (IAC),  which  held  that  in  areas  where  Kanun  code   predominates
    (particularly  in  Northern  Albania)  there  is  not  sufficiency   of
    protection  from  Kanun-related  blood-taking.  The   judge   was   not
    satisfied, for the reasons given in the decision, that the  appellant's
    situation equated to a blood-feud and was not  satisfied  that  he  had
    been threatened with kidnap. The judge did not accept that the father's
    debts could have transferred to the appellant when his father was alive
    and his whereabouts known. As stated above, the judge also pointed  out
    that other members of the family had not been threatened and  thus  was
    not satisfied that the appellant had established causation between  the
    debts pursued against  his  father  and  the  risk  to  the  appellant.
    Contrary to the suggestion of Mr Draycott, the judge did  grapple  with
    EH, and on the basis that he did not accept that there was  any  blood-
    feud on the facts of this  case,  no  one  was  killed,  nor  that  the
    appellant's circumstances put him at risk because of  the  Kanun  code,
    went on to consider sufficiency of protection, in  the  alternative  to
    the primary findings of the appeal, from the  state  against  non-state
    actors, concluding that  there  was  a  sufficiency  of  protection  in
    general terms. In this regard, I accept the submission of  Mr  Whitwell
    that Mr Draycott' submissions  conflate  two  different  situations  in
    order to challenge the conclusions of the judge. In  the  circumstances
    no error of law is disclosed on this ground.

17. The final ground of appeal (E) relates to the  suicide  risk.  On  this
    ground Mr Draycott has attempted to undermine the judge's record of the
    evidence of the two oral witnesses,  by  adducing  his  own  notes  and
    purporting, in effect to give evidence as the advocate representing the
    appellant at the appeal. Even though there is a  letter  from  Mr  Smit
    confirming  his  recollection  of  what  was  said,  this  is  entirely
    insufficient to interfere with those findings. As Mr Draycott is aware,
    there is a process or procedure for challenging the  accuracy  of  what
    was said at  the  First-tier  Tribunal  appeal  hearing,  in  which  Mr
    Draycott would have  to  be  a  witness  rather  than  the  appellant's
    representative, and the judge should have been asked to comment on  the
    alleged discrepancy between what the decision records was said and that
    version now put forward by Mr Draycott. The  judge  accepted  that  the
    appellant suffered from mental health issues, was vulnerable, and noted
    the views of the witnesses that he was 'needy' and would not be able to
    cope. But as things stand, the judge  recorded  evidence  that  neither
    witness thought that the appellant was at  risk  of  seriously  harming
    himself. The arguments put  forward  by  Mr  Draycott  do  not  justify
    interfering with this part of the decision. It  must  follow  that  the
    conclusions of the judge were  entirely  open,  on  the  basis  of  the
    judge's record of the evidence.

18. In effect, the details grounds and extensive submissions of Mr Draycott
    amount to an attempt to  relitigate  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal and do not disclose anything other than a piecemeal attempt to
    dissect what was a careful and thorough consideration of  the  evidence
    and the relevant law.



Conclusions:

19. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

                    I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed on all grounds.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  continue  that
anonymity order.





Fee Award     Note: this is not part of the determination.

In the light of my decision, I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: No fee is payable in this case and thus there can be no fee award.
