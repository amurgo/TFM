Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr Usman (Usman and Co Solicitors).
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan (Senior Home Office Presenting Officer)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is the appeal of  Qamar  Abbas,  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  born  7
    September 1977, against the  decision  of  18  September  2014  by  the
    Respondent to refuse him leave to  enter  and  set  removal  directions
    against him following the decision to refuse his asylum claim.

 2. The Appellant arrived in the United Kingdom in January 2001 and claimed
    asylum, on the basis that he and his brother had been harassed  by  the
    police because of their Shia faith and membership of the MQM which  had
    led to their father's murder in December 2000 at the hands of the state
    authorities. His asylum claim was refused by  the  Secretary  of  State
    because, whilst he may have been involved with the MQM as a  youth  and
    the country evidence indicated  that  his  claim  as  to  his  father's
    involvement and subsequent ill treatment and death at the hands of  the
    security forces was plausible, he had not  maintained  any  involvement
    with the MQM and his failure to seriously pursue his claim by  engaging
    with the refugee determination process for a number of years undermined
    his credibility.

 3. Judge Hawdon-Beal determining the appeal in the First-tier Tribunal  in
    a decision dated 17 November 2014 did not  accept  that  the  Appellant
    would face persecution on a return to Pakistan, because the authorities
    had ample opportunity to act against him and his older brother had they
    genuinely been interested in doing them harm; besides,  after  so  many
    years away, there was no reason to think him still at risk  on  return,
    given his low profile in the MQM. In any event he could  relocate  from
    Lahore to another part of the country where he would be safe and  where
    there was no reason to think the authorities would not provide him with
    protection.

 4. The Appellant's alternative head  of  argument,  based  on  his  rights
    protected by Article 8 of the ECHR, had two elements: his family  life,
    as by the time of the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal,  the
    Appellant was in a relationship with a refugee, and his  private  life,
    based on his long residence here which had inevitably led him  to  form
    friendships here and to remain here lawfully. He raised the question of
    the relationship on his appeal, as he was entitled to do under  GEN.1.9
    of the Immigration Rules. The First-tier Tribunal did not  accept  that
    the relationship amounted to family life absent proof  of  cohabitation
    and the reality of their family life together. It noted his account  of
    having worked in this country lawfully, if  spasmodically,  since  July
    2012, and of  having  socialised  with  various  friends  at  community
    charity events, the local mosque,  barber's  shop,  and  local  Chinese
    restaurant, who had provided letters of support,  though  he  expressed
    equivocation as to the credibility of their assertions to have  a  very
    close relationship on account of the fact that many lived far away from
    him.  Given  the  delay  in  determining  the  Appellant's  outstanding
    application, the fact that he was economically active and  could  speak
    English, Judge Hawdon-Beal found that he had established  private  life
    which would be the subject of a sufficiently serious interference  were
    he to be removed as to amount to a breach of Article 8 ECHR.

 5. An application for permission to appeal was brought by the Secretary of
    State. Permission to appeal was granted on 23 March 2015 and  following
    a hearing to establish the question of error of law, Judge Conway found
    that the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  had  to  be  set  aside
    because of the inconsistency in the judge's approach to  the  evidence,
    in that he appeared to have both doubted yet accepted the  strength  of
    his private life with his friends, and that having  expressed  concerns
    as to the extent to which the Appellant had lawfully worked,  had  been
    wrong to treat him as a person whose connections with the labour market
    could render his removal disproportionate.

 6. The matter was then adjourned and the appeal  came  on  for  re-hearing
    before the Upper Tribunal, now constituted as  a  Panel,  Judge  Conway
    being joined by Judge Symes, on 8 July 2015. No challenge was  made  to
    the findings of the First-tier Tribunal as to the asylum claim.

 7. The Appellant gave evidence, saying  that  he  and  his  now  wife  had
    married by way of civil ceremony on 17 February 2015  and  then  had  a
    religious ceremony in April 2015. They now cohabited in Oxford, and had
    done so from the date of their civil marriage.  Friends  and  relatives
    had attended the ceremony but had not come to the hearing today because
    he had felt it was wrong to ask them to do so during Ramadan, when they
    were fasting over the long summer days. He had worked  since  2012:  he
    had not claimed public funds  and  had  lived  with  different  friends
    during his time in the United Kingdom.

 8. Cross examined he said that he had earned �115 a week, as an  assistant
    in various shops. His wife earned �200 a week working in the  reception
    of a take-away restaurant; she had pay slips though they had not placed
    them before the Tribunal. She  was  paid  in  cash  and  there  was  no
    evidence of her earnings by way of deposits into a bank  account.  They
    could not reasonably be expected to live  abroad  as  his  wife  was  a
    refugee from Pakistan.

 9. The Appellant's wife MM gave evidence. She confirmed the date of  their
    civil ceremony and said they had had the religious ceremony on 19 April
    2015, after when they had moved in together. They had no  documents  to
    show this aside from their registration with the local GP,  which  they
    had not thought to provide to the Tribunal. Her father had  high  blood
    pressure and her mother lived in Blackburn, which  had  prevented  them
    attending to attest to the genuineness of their relationship.  She  had
    been granted asylum on the basis of her family's Ahmadi faith.

10. Cross examined she said that she had no proof  of  cohabitation  beyond
    the addresses on her pay slips. She earned some �800 a month, and could
    not say what this amounted to every week.

11. For the Respondent it was submitted that the limited material available
    did not establish that the relationship was a genuine one. Even  if  it
    was to be accepted that the relationship was factually  established  so
    as to qualify for assessment under the Exception at  Ex.1  of  Appendix
    FM, there were no insurmountable obstacles to the  Appellant  returning
    abroad and seeking entry clearance, there being no children involved.

12. For the Appellant it was  submitted  that  the  lack  of  documentation
    showing the genuine nature  of  their  relationship  was  down  to  the
    marriage having taken place very recently. The  Appellant  had  clearly
    established private life in the United Kingdom given his long residence
    here and the delays in processing his asylum claim meant that, applying
    the EB Kosovo principle, he should be granted leave to remain.




    Findings and Reasons

13. The evidence provided in support of the relationship being  genuine  is
    extraordinarily scant, despite the fact that its veracity  was  put  in
    issue by the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  some  months  ago.
    Notwithstanding the fact that Judge Hawdon-Beal rejected the claim that
    there was family life established between the couple absent  supporting
    evidence, virtually nothing further of substance has been placed before
    the  Upper  Tribunal.  No  supporting  witnesses   have   been   called
    notwithstanding that various family members are said to  have  attended
    the civil and religious ceremonies: there is no reason  to  think  that
    they  would  lack  knowledge  of  the  reality   of   the   Appellant's
    relationship. There has been no detailed evidence provided  as  to  the
    history of their relationship and how it developed over time by way  of
    witness statement or oral evidence. There  is  no  persuasive  evidence
    available as to their asserted cohabitation. Given that the application
    was not made to the  Home  Office,  but  only  raised  on  appeal,  the
    Respondent has not had  the  opportunity  to  make  any  enquiries  for
    herself: this does not prevent Appendix FM being raised on appeal,  but
    it does give us pause for thought before accepting poorly substantiated
    contentions.

14. We do not accept, on balance of probabilities, that the relationship is
    established as a genuine and subsisting marriage. We do  not  say  that
    the Appellant and Sponsor are party to  a  dishonest  attempt  to  gain
    leave to remain for him by deception: merely  that,  on  the  materials
    before us, we  are  unable  to  conclude  that  they  are  party  to  a
    subsisting relationship. It is open to them to pursue their attempt  to
    regularise the Appellant's immigration status by making the appropriate
    application  to  the  Secretary  of  State  directly,   providing   the
    appropriate documentation.

15. Our rejection of the fact of a relationship  qualifying  the  Appellant
    for the partner route determines the outcome of the  appeal  on  family
    life grounds both inside and outside the Immigration Rules. The case as
    put under Appendix FM fails as it is not established that  the  Sponsor
    is  the  Appellant's  partner.  There  can   be   no   disproportionate
    interference with family life where the factual relationship underlying
    the asserted Article 8  rights  has  not  been  established  by  cogent
    evidence.

16. As to the other dimension of the Appellant's Article 8 claim, we accept
    that his lengthy residence  in  this  country  will  have  led  to  his
    establishing private life. The letters from his friends such as Mr Khan
    Mani of London SW18 show that he regularly participates in charity  and
    community activities; Mr Tsang says he joins him and  his  friends  for
    nights out, and makes his children laugh. There are  other  letters  to
    similar effect.

17. We do not accept that this material can lead to  his  appeal's  success
    under the Immigration Rules: Rule 276ADE(vi) requires that he establish
     "very significant obstacles to [his] integration into the  country  to
    which he would have to go if required to leave the UK." He is a  person
    who appears to make friends easily and who  would  return  to  Pakistan
    with the advantage of a lengthy stay in  an  English-speaking  country,
    which should equip him to make a life for himself in a country where he
    presumably has extended family members to support him.

18. So the case turns on proportionality. Its assessment must take  account
    of certain statutory factors in so far as  they  are  relevant  to  the
    considerations in play in this case.

         "PART 5A

         Article 8 of the ECHR: public interest considerations ...

         117B Article 8: public interest considerations  applicable  in  all
         cases

         (1)      The maintenance of effective immigration  controls  is  in
             the public interest.

         (2)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are able to speak  English,  because  persons  who  can  speak
             English-

             (a) are less of a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (3)      It is in the public interest, and  in  particular  in  the
             interests of the economic well-being of  the  United  Kingdom,
             that persons who seek to enter or remain in the United Kingdom
             are financially independent, because such persons-

             (a) are not a burden on taxpayers, and

             (b) are better able to integrate into society.

         (4)      Little weight should be given to-

             (a) a private life, or

             (b) a relationship formed with a qualifying partner,

             that is established by a person at a time when the  person  is
             in the United Kingdom unlawfully.

         (5)       Little  weight  should  be  given  to  a   private   life
             established  by  a  person  at  a  time  when   the   person's
             immigration status is precarious. ...."

19. The Appellant's presence in the United  Kingdom,  whilst  lengthy,  has
    been consistently on a precarious basis. The  Secretary  of  State  has
    delayed in the determination of his asylum claim, but Mr Usman did  not
    seek to persuade us that the history set out by the First-tier Tribunal
    at [23]-[24]  of  its  determination  was  incorrect:  the  Appellant's
    representatives have given conflicting evidence over  time  as  to  his
    wish to pursue an asylum or human rights claim,  he  has  not  kept  in
    touch with his solicitors consistently, and he has known at least since
    March 2011 that he  had  missed  the  interview  at  which  he  had  an
    opportunity to put forward his asylum claim. So whilst it is true  that
    he spent some years awaiting the determination  of  his  asylum  claim,
    that claim has been assessed  on  appeal  as  unfounded.  As  was  most
    recently stated  by  the  European  Court  of  Human  Rights  in  AS  v
    Switzerland [2015] ECHR 627, the  fact  that  the  presence  of  asylum
    seekers on the territory of state party to the ECHR is tolerated by the
    national authorities whilst  asylum  claims  are  determined  does  not
    automatically entail that they must be  granted  settlement  under  any
    obligation arising  pursuant  to  Article  8  of  the  Convention.  The
    situation might be different where  an  asylum  claim  is  accepted  as
    viable at the time of the person's arrival in the United Kingdom but is
    defeated only by a post-arrival change of circumstances, or where there
    is some other prejudice to the  person  involved,  or  even  where  the
    protected Article 8 interests are rather stronger than a  bare  private
    life  case  based  on  friendships  established  during   the   claim's
    determination: but none of those factors  are  present  here,  and  the
    unchallenged finding of the First-tier Tribunal is that he was  not  at
    risk when he first left Pakistan.

20. The Appellant's working history is sketchy and he has  lived  here  for
    many years without being economically active. To his credit  he  speaks
    English. None of his friends attended the hearing to give  evidence  of
    the  strength  of  his  connections  here.  They  do  not  suggest  the
    relationships that he has here are the kind of friendships  that  could
    not be readily replicated abroad by a sociable person such as  himself.
    We do not think that they can be categorised as central to his identity
    or to his ability to function as an individual. He has had the relative
    advantage of having worked in this country which should give  him  some
    additional experience on which to draw should he return to Pakistan.

21. On balance we do not consider that the public interest in maintaining a
    consistent and certain system of immigration control is  outweighed  by
    the private life established by the Appellant in the United Kingdom. We
    accordingly dismiss the appeal.

    Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law which led to  its  decision  being
    set aside.

    We re-make the decision in  the  appeal  by  dismissing  it.  In  those
    circumstances no fee award is appropriate.
