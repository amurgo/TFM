                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. Pursuant to rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008  (SI  2008/2698)  I  make  an  anonymity  order  prohibiting   the
    disclosure or publication of any matter likely to lead  to  members  of
    the public identifying the appellant.  A failure to  comply  with  this
    direction could lead to Contempt of Court proceedings.

Introduction

 2. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe who was born on 20 August  2000.



 3. On 20 January  2008,  the  appellant  made  an  application  for  entry
    clearance to the UK under para 297 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395  as
    amended).  The application was for settlement  with  the  sponsor  (his
    uncle) who is settled in the UK.

 4. On 20 September 2018, the Entry Clearance Officer ("ECO")  refused  the
    appellant's application for entry clearance.  The ECO was not satisfied
    that the sponsor had "sole  responsibility"  for  the  appellant  (para
    297(i)(e)) or that there were "serious and compelling family  or  other
    considerations which make exclusion  of  [the  appellant]  undesirable"
    (para 297(i)(f)).

 5. Finally, the ECO concluded that the decision to refuse entry  clearance
    was not a breach of Art 8 of the ECHR.

 6. The ECO's decision was reviewed  and  upheld  by  the  Entry  Clearance
    Manager on 27 January 2019.

The Appeal to the First-tier Tribunal

 7. The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  In a  determination
    sent on 13 June 2019, Judge G Wilson dismissed the appellant's  appeal.



 8. Although the appeal was limited to human rights grounds, in effect  Art
    8 of the ECHR, the judge approached the issue of whether the refusal of
    entry clearance  breached  Art  8  by  first  considering  whether  the
    appellant could succeed under para 297.  The judge found that he  could
    not.  Like the ECO, he concluded that the appellant had not established
    that his sponsor had "sole responsibility" for him or that  there  were
    "serious and compelling family or other considerations" that  made  his
    exclusion undesirable.  Finally, having concluded  that  the  appellant
    could not succeed under para 297, the judge found that the  appellant's
    exclusion was a proportionate interference with his private and  family
    life under Art 8 of the ECHR.

The Appeal to the Upper Tribunal

 9. The appellant sought permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    basis of a number of grounds prepared by the sponsor.

10. On 25 September 2019, the  First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  E  M  Simpson)
    granted the appellant permission to appeal.

11. Thus, the appeal came before me.

The Judge's Decision

12. The grounds, and the submissions before  me,  focused  on  the  judge's
    reasons for finding first, at [27] - [34] that the  appellant  had  not
    established that his uncle  had  "sole  responsibility"  for  him;  and
    secondly, his reasons at [35] - [41] for finding that  there  were  not
    "serious and compelling family or other considerations".

13. The background to the claim is that the appellant's father  and  mother
    died when he was 3 and 7 years of age respectively.  After his father's
    death, the appellant's mother looked  after  him  until  her  death  in
    December 2007.  In 2008, he went to live with an uncle in Zimbabwe.  He
    looked after the appellant for about a year, until the sponsor  decided
    that this was not suitable and he went to live with his aunt.  That was
    in 2009.  Thereafter, although the sponsor lived  in  Zimbabwe  for  23
    months with the appellant from September 2013 to  September  2015,  the
    appellant lived with his aunt who looked after him.

14. It appears to have been accepted before the judge that the sponsor  and
    the appellant's aunt shared responsibility until 2016.  At  that  time,
    the appellant's aunt became engaged to man in Zimbabwe and it  was  her
    intention to live with him in  his  family  home  elsewhere.   At  this
    point, the sponsor claimed that he took over "sole responsibility"  for
    the appellant and the  appellant's  aunt  was  not  in  a  position  to
    continue looking after the appellant when she married and moved to live
    with her new husband as the appellant could not be accommodated  there.
    It was on that basis that the sponsor, it is  said,  decided  that  the
    appellant should come to the UK to live with the sponsor and his  wife.
    The  appellant's  aunt  married  her  new   husband   in   late   2018.
    Subsequently, the sponsor's evidence was that the  appellant  continued
    to live with his aunt on a "temporary basis" and she did  not  move  to
    live with her new husband.

15. Before Judge Wilson, the sponsor provided written  supporting  evidence
    from himself and he gave oral evidence.   He also relied upon a  latter
    from the appellant's aunt dated 10 February 2018 and WhatsApp  messages
    and  two  letters  from  the  appellant's  school  in  support  of  the
    contention that he (that is the sponsor) had "sole responsibility"  for
    the appellant.  He also relied upon an order appointing the sponsor  as
    the appellant's guardian dated 24 October 2016.

16. In his determination, Judge Wilson correctly identified the approach to
    the issue of "sole responsibility" applying the well-known decision  in
    TD (Para 297(i)(e): "sole responsibility")  Yemen  [2006]  UKAIT  00049
    namely, the principal issue  is  whether  the  sponsor  had  continuing
    control and direction over the appellant's upbringing including  making
    all  the  important  decisions  in  his   life   (see   [18]   of   the
    determination).

17. In relation to the issue of "sole responsibility",  the  judge  reached
    his adverse decision in paras [27] - [34] as follows:

         "27. It is undisputed by the Respondent that the  Appellant  has  a
             relationship with the sponsor.  In assessing the relationship,
             I have considered the transcripts of  the  WhatsApp  messages.
             The authenticity of  these  messages  was  undisputed  by  the
             Respondent  albeit  that   they   are   not   screenshots   of
             conversations but  rather  a  transcript.   I  note  that  the
             messages are a  mixture  of  English  and  Shona  two  of  the
             languages of Zimbabwe.   The  messages  have  the  feel  of  a
             general  conversation.   In   addition,   their   content   is
             consistent with the written and oral evidence of  the  sponsor
             and the Western Union transfers, the  conversations  and  deal
             with requests and receipts from money; the  sponsor  providing
             funds for day-to-day school essentials for the  Appellant  and
             conversations  relating   to   the   Appellant's   immigration
             application  Accordingly, whilst I have am concerns  that  the
             messages are transcripts I am willing for the purpose of  this
             determination to take the evidence at  its  highest  and  find
             that these transcripts are a genuine and  true  reflection  of
             conversations between the sponsor and the  Appellant  and  the
             sponsor and the Appellant's aunt.

         28.  There are numerous documents evidencing money  transfers  from
             the sponsor to the Appellant via his  aunt  over  a  sustained
             period.   There  are  numerous  references  in  the   WhatsApp
             conversations to money transfers and  requests  for  financial
             support.  On the evidence before me, I have no  difficulty  in
             finding that the sponsor financially  supports  the  Appellant
             and that the  Appellant  is  financially  dependent  upon  the
             sponsor.

         29.  In terms of emotional  dependency  the  WhatsApp  conversation
             clearly show a close relationship between  the  Appellant  and
             the sponsor.  The Appellant  discusses  issues  such  as  exam
             performance  and  his  aspirations   to   open   a   business.
             Accordingly, I find that the Appellant is in part  emotionally
             supported by the sponsor.  However, the Appellant has lived in
             Zimbabwe under the care of his aunt for a  significant  number
             of years.  I find that in these  circumstances  the  Appellant
             cannot be solely dependent  upon  the  sponsor  for  emotional
             support through limited WhatsApp messages and visits.  I  find
             that  the  emotional  support  will  be  given  by  both   the
             Appellant's aunt and the sponsor.

         30.  The test of sole responsibility is  whether  the  sponsor  has
             control and direction over  all  of  the  important  decisions
             within the Appellant's life.  Taking the evidence as  a  whole
             and at its  highest,  I  find  that  this  test  is  not  been
             satisfied.  The sponsor and  the  Appellant  accept  that  the
             Appellant's aunt provides care but maintain that all important
             decisions are made under the direction of the  sponsor.   This
             assertion is inconsistent with a letter dated 10 February 2018
             from  the  Appellant's  aunt.   The  Appellant's  aunt  states
             'although I had the main responsibility  of  bringing  up  the
             Appellant my brother  and  wife  have  always  been  there  to
             assist.  The sponsor has been helping with  decisions,  school
             fees, clothing and food he has been a father  figure  and  his
             wife is a  mother  figure.   The  Appellant  regards  them  as
             parents because the mum and dad there were strong relationship
             and they normally come to Zimbabwe each year to  be  with  him
             and always be with  him  when  they  come'.   The  Appellant's
             aunt's letter does not suggest that she is merely a carer,  it
             suggests that she has responsibility for the Appellant and the
             sponsor assists.  The letter is not consistent with the  level
             of control that the sponsor claims he exercises.   The  letter
             does not indicate that  all  decisions  are  retained  by  the
             sponsor made under his direction.  At its highest  the  letter
             is indicative of shared responsibility.

         31.  The Appellant has been under  the  care  of  his  aunt  for  a
             significant period of time.  Even if I were to accept that the
             sponsor took sole responsibility in 2016, when the Appellant's
             aunt decided to marry then there is still a distinct  lack  of
             evidence as to directions given by  the  sponsor  during  this
             period.  There is a letter dated the 20  December  2012  which
             states which school that the sponsor would like the  Appellant
             to attend.  There is then in excess of 50  pages  of  WhatsApp
             messages.  The what SAP messages are a mixture of English  and
             Shona.  However, within 58 pages of WhatsApp messages covering
             a period from 2015  to  2019  the  sponsor  could  only  refer
             limited examples of entries which he asserted were directions.
              This involved that a suggestion that the Appellant did not go
             on holiday and a  in  April  2016  enquiries  as  to  how  the
             Appellant was getting  on  with  his  exams.   This  entry  is
             particularly interesting as the Appellant's aunt replies  that
             there are no exams.  The sponsor asks why and the  Appellant's
             aunt states that the exams are next term.  This entry does not
             suggest that the  sponsor  is  in  control  of  all  important
             documents within the Appellant's life it suggests that he  was
             unaware of the precise  dates  of  important  exams  that  the
             Appellant was about to take.  It suggests that the Appellant's
             aunt is in control of the Appellant's education  or  at  least
             some of those decisions rather than sponsor.

         32.  The Appellant has provided two letters which the Appellant are
             from his school.   The letters are handwritten and are not  on
             headed paper.  The letters can be contrasted with  the  school
             report which includes a front page  of  the  with  the  school
             insignia contact details and header.  Against this background,
             I have concerns that official correspondence from  the  school
             would be delivered in such an informal manner.  In  any  event
             the letters simply given update as to the Appellant's progress
             and state that  the  sponsor  can  support  through  financial
             contributions.  The letter's do not corroborate the  assertion
             that decisions in relation to the  Appellant's  education  are
             made solely by the sponsor.

         33.  The Appellant has provided an Order appointing the sponsor  as
             guardian the Order is dated 24 October 2016.  However, by 2017
             the sponsor had given power of  attorney  to  the  Appellant's
             aunt in respect of the Appellant.  The  sponsor  asserts  this
             was merely for the purposes of obtaining a passport.  However,
             there is no evidence that  the  power  of  attorney  has  been
             revoked and in any event the grant of power of attorney,  even
             if only to allow  the  aunt  to  obtain  a  passport  for  the
             Appellant, is indicative that the  aunt  was  exercising  some
             sort of decision-making for the Appellant.

         34.  Taking the evidence as a whole I am far  from  satisfied  that
             the sponsor has sole responsibility for the  Appellant.   Even
             taking the evidence at its highest, I find that responsibility
             is shared between the sponsor and the Appellant's aunt."

18. As will be clear, the  judge  accepted  that  the  sponsor  financially
    supports the appellant.  However, he did not accept that since 2016 (as
    appears to have been the  sponsor's  case)  he  had  taken  over  "sole
    responsibility".   The  judge  did  not  find  the  letter   from   the
    appellant's aunt supportive of  such  a  finding;  there  were  limited
    directly relevant WhatsApp messages and the school letters, even  taken
    at their highest, simply updated the appellant's progress and that  the
    sponsor supported him through financial contributions.  Finally, and  I
    will return to this later, the judge considered that  the  grant  of  a
    power of attorney by the sponsor to the appellant's aunt was indicative
    that the aunt was exercising some  sort  of  decision  making  for  the
    appellant, i.e. not all important decisions  were  being  made  by  the
    sponsor.

19.  Next,  as  regards   "serious   and   compelling   family   or   other
    considerations", the judge dealt with this in  paras  [35]  -  [41]  as
    follows:

         "35. The sponsors oral evidence corroborated by the letter provided
             by the Appellant's  aunt  is  that  the  Appellant  could  not
             continue to live with his aunt.  The Appellant's aunt's letter
             states that she is to be married and that  her  husband  would
             not allow the Appellant to live with  them.   The  Appellant's
             aunt is to move to her fianc�'s hometown and  his  family  did
             not want her to bring the Appellant albeit he appears to  have
             a good relationship with the Appellant.

         36.  The sponsor asserted that the Appellant's aunt's fianc� has  a
             large family and there would not be room for the Appellant.

         37.   Under  cross  examination  the  sponsor  confirmed  that  the
             Appellant's aunt is now married.  The sponsor  confirmed  that
             the Appellant continues to live with his aunt.

         38.  The Appellant's application was made on 27 July 2018.  Despite
             this, almost a year later the Appellant continues to live with
             his  aunt  notwithstanding  her  marriage.   The   Appellant's
             continued residence with his aunt for a  period  of  almost  a
             year following her marriage is  inconsistent  with  his  claim
             that he would that he would be unable to live  with  his  aunt
             who would be unwilling to accommodate him due to her impending
             marriage.  This inconsistency undermines  the  credibility  of
             this element of the Appellant's claim.

         39.  It is also telling that throughout the WhatsApp  conversations
             my attention has not been drawn to entries  dealing  with  the
             difficulties that the Appellant's aunt's claim she will facing
             in  continuing  to   accommodate   the   Appellant.    It   is
             inconsistent that the Appellant would potentially be  rendered
             homeless due to his aunt circumstances and  yet  there  is  no
             mention of this  within  the  numerous  WhatsApp  between  the
             Appellant and sponsor and sponsor  and  the  Appellant's  aunt
             over a significant period of time.

         40.  In addition, the timing of the alleged  marriage  gives  cause
             for  concern.   The  Appellant's  aunt  has  brought  up   the
             Appellant for a significant number of years.  However,  it  is
             only as he is completing his education and reaching  adulthood
             that she finds  she  is  to  be  married  and  can  no  longer
             accommodate or care for the Appellant.

         41.  For all the reasons set out above, I find that  the  Appellant
             has demonstrated, to the appropriate standard of  proof,  that
             there are compelling family or other circumstances which  make
             his exclusions undesirable in the manner that he describes  or
             at all.  I find that the Appellant has not  demonstrated  that
             the arrangements for his care  are  unsatisfactory  or  cannot
             continue within the current manner."

20. There, perhaps importantly, the judge regarded the continuation of  the
    status quo of the appellant living with his aunt, despite her now being
    married, as being inconsistent with the evidence that his aunt would be
    unwilling to accommodate the appellant.

Discussion

21. I heard oral submissions both from  the  sponsor  and  Mr  Howells  who
    represented the ECO.  The  sponsor  relied  upon  his  own  handwritten
    grounds drafted on behalf of the appellant.

22. It is fair to say, as Mr Howells submitted, that the sponsor has raised
    a  number  of  new  matters  subsequent  to   the   judge's   decision.
    Principally, perhaps, he indicated that the evidence was now that as  a
    result of the delay the relationship between the appellant and his aunt
    had broken down.  That, of course, is not a matter which can  be  taken
    into account at this stage in determining whether the  judge  erred  in
    law in reaching his decision.  Its only relevance would arise  if  that
    decision is set aside and has to be remade.

23.  The  sponsor's  submissions  largely  took  issue  with  the   judge's
    assessment of the evidence and, in  that  regard,  were  no  more  than
    disagreements with the approach  of  the  judge.   As  I  have  already
    pointed out, the judge accepted that the sponsor financially  supported
    the appellant such that the latter was financially dependent  upon  the
    sponsor.  Likewise, he accepted that there was an emotional  dependency
    between  the  appellant  and  sponsor.   Those  factors,  however,   in
    themselves do not establish that the sponsor had "sole  responsibility"
    at least since 2016 as claimed.

24. Taking each of the relevant paragraphs in turn between paras 30 and 34,
    with one exception I accept  Mr  Howells'  submission  that  the  judge
    properly considered the evidence.

25. In para 30, having quoted a  passage  from  the  appellant's  aunt,  he
    concluded entirely reasonable that this did not support  the  sponsor's
    contention that the sponsor had sole responsibility  since  2016.   The
    judge was, no doubt, somewhat hampered by the fact that  the  photocopy
    of the aunt's letter in the file only consists of the first  page.   It
    is plain from that letter that this is incomplete  but  when  I  raised
    this matter with the sponsor at  the  hearing  he  indicated  that  the
    remainder of the letter had been lost and this was all that  the  judge
    had.  The passage from the letter offers no support to  the  contention
    that the sponsor now has sole responsibility.

26. As regards para 31, the judge noted the WhatsApp  messages  running  in
    excess of 50 pages, many of which (as I  observed  at  the  hearing  by
    reading them), are not in English  but  in  Shona.   Whilst  the  judge
    recognised that there are some elements that support  directions  being
    given by the sponsor, the judge was  entitled  reasonably  to  conclude
    that in themselves they did not establish that  the  sponsor  had  sole
    responsibility for the appellant's upbringing.

27. The sponsor told me at the hearing that many  of  the  directions  were
    made in oral telephone conversations.  There was, of course, no  record
    of those conversations before the judge and, so far as I can  tell,  no
    detailed, if any, significant evidence of them  in  the  oral  evidence
    before him.

28. As regards para 32, the judge was entitled to note that the two  school
    reports were not on headed paper by contrast to other documents.   That
    said, however, both letters do have 'stamps' upon them.   Nevertheless,
    as Mr Howells submitted and I accept, the contents of the letters  adds
    little weight to the contention again that the sponsor  is  making  all
    the important decisions in the appellant's life.

29. That then leaves para 33: the position here is different.   Mr  Howells
    accepted, when I raised the matter with  him  during  his  submissions,
    that the judge had been wrong to treat the grant of a power of attorney
    by the sponsor to the aunt  as  being  inconsistent  with  the  sponsor
    having sole responsibility.  The evidence before the judge  was  clear.
    In order for the appellant to obtain a passport in Nigeria,  there  had
    to be a person present in Nigeria who could obtain  it  for  him.   The
    sponsor had no choice but to grant a power of attorney to  someone,  in
    this case the most obvious person namely his aunt with whom  he  lived,
    in order to obtain that passport to come to the  UK.   Far  from  being
    indicative of not making an important decision in the appellant's life,
    the power of attorney  (linked  to  the  decision  that  the  appellant
    required a passport to come to the UK) was  an  example  of  making  an
    important decision consistent with  the  contention  that  it  was  the
    sponsor who made the important decisions in the appellant's life.

30. Mr Howells submitted that, nevertheless, the judge had given  a  number
    of other reasons why he was not satisfied that the  sponsor  had  "sole
    responsibility" and so any error in para 33 was not material.

31. I do not agree.  The judge's approach in para 33 is  plainly  in  error
    and  is  expressed  as  a  clear  negative  factor   inconsistent   the
    appellant's claim that the sponsor has sole responsibility.  There  was
    some evidence of decision  making  by  the  sponsor  both  in  his  own
    evidence and supported by the WhatsApp messages.  He  had  guardianship
    of the appellant.  Whilst the latter was not determinative of the issue
    of who in practice had "sole responsibility", it was a relevant factor.
     Taken together, I am not persuaded that had the judge not fallen  into
    error in para 33 he would inevitably  have  reached  the  same  factual
    finding.

32. In my judgment,  his  error  was  material  to  his  finding  that  the
    appellant could not satisfy the requirement in para 297(i)(e).

33. Turning to the judge's finding in relation to para 297(i)(f) at [35]  -
    [41], as I have already indicated the new matters raised by the sponsor
    which postdate the judge's decision are  not  relevant  in  determining
    whether the judge was legally entitled to reach  the  finding  that  he
    did.  There is, however, a difficulty in the  judge's  reasoning.   The
    evidence before the judge was that, on her  marriage,  the  appellant's
    aunt could no longer accommodate the appellant  because  she  would  be
    moving to live with her husband and  his  family  where  the  appellant
    could not be accommodated.  The appellant's continued accommodation  by
    his aunt (before she moved) was only temporary.  Yet, in  para  38  the
    judge interprets that temporary arrangement as being inconsistent  with
    the claim that the appellant's aunt was unwilling (the judge's word) or
    unable to accommodate him as  a  result  of  her  marriage.   But,  the
    present arrangement was only continuing because the appellant  had  not
    yet come to the UK.  The evidence was that the appellant's  aunt  would
    move to live with her new husband as soon as she was able.   The  judge
    did not call into question any of this evidence.  However, in  para  38
    he treated the appellant's temporary circumstances -  which  could  not
    persist if it is accepted that the appellant's aunt would move to  live
    with her husband - as circumstances which would continue in the  future
    such that it could not be said there would be "serious  and  compelling
    family  or  other  considerations"  making  the  appellant's  exclusion
    undesirable.  In effect, he would not become homeless.  That,  however,
    ignores the reality of the situation and the temporary  nature  of  his
    aunt's willingness and ability to continue to accommodate him.  It  was
    incumbent upon the judge, on the evidence,  to  determine  whether  the
    reality and practicality of the situation was that, given  the  dilemma
    faced by the appellant's aunt, he was at risk  of  being  left  without
    accommodation because eventually (if entry clearance was  not  granted)
    his aunt would move to live with her husband and the appellant would be
    without accommodation.  There was, contrary to what the judge stated in
    the final sentence of para 38, no inconsistency in the appellant's aunt
    continuing to temporarily accommodate the appellant (rather than  leave
    him homeless) pending the resolution of the  appeal  which,  no  doubt,
    they all hoped would be resolved in the appellant's favour.

34. Consequently, the judge gave inadequate reasons in para 38  leading  to
    his finding that there were not serious and compelling family or  other
    considerations so that the requirements of para 297(i)(f) were not met.



35. Whether or not the appellant met  the  requirements  of  para  297  was
    central to the judge's determination of whether the decision to  refuse
    the appellant entry clearance breached Art 8.  As  a  consequence,  his
    decision to dismiss the appeal under Art 8 is  equally  flawed  by  the
    legal errors in reaching his findings under para 297.

Decision

36. For the above reasons, the First-tier Tribunal's  decision  to  dismiss
    the appellant's appeal under Art 8 involved the making of an  error  of
    law. The decision is set aside.

37. Mr Howells accepted that if the judge's decision could not  stand,  the
    proper disposal of the  appeal  was  to  remit  it  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a de  novo  rehearing  given  that  the  remaking  of  the
    decision would involve a consideration of  both  documentary  and  oral
    evidence, including evidence postdating the judge's decision.

38. I agree.  Given the nature and extent  of  fact-finding  required,  and
    having regard to para 7.2 of the Senior President's Practice Statement,
    the proper disposal of this appeal is to remit  it  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a de novo rehearing before a  judge  other  than  Judge  G
    Wilson.
