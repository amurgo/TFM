Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Z Nasim, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr I Jarvis, Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   The respondent has been granted permission to appeal  the  decision  of
    First-tier Judge A M Baldwin who dismissed the appellant's appeal under
    the Immigration Rules and allowed  it  on  human  rights  grounds.  The
    appellant is a citizen of  Albania  born  on  27  December  1991.   She
    applied for entry clearance as a spouse.  The application  was  refused
    on 27 March 2013 because the respondent  was  not  satisfied  that  the
    appellant met the maintenance requirements or that the sponsor was free
    to marry her at the time of their marriage.

2.   The judge held as follows:-

         "20. I accept that it may well be the case that the  Appellant  did
             provide with her Application more documents  than  the  E.C.O.
             has listed and it may be that the Sponsor, who I found to be a
             distressed, genuine husband, believed he had given  everything
             which was likely to be  required.   However,  the  Grounds  of
             Appeal themselves  point  away  from  everything  having  been
             provided because Section D (p.5) makes it very clear that  the
             Divorce paperwork and Accounts  were  only  provided  at  that
             stage, his SA302 would follow 'very shortly' and the  rest  of
             the paperwork  from  HMRC  would  also  follow.   I  therefore
             conclude that the Appeal must fail under  the  Rules.   I  now
             address Article 8.


         21.  The Appellant was at the time of her application  and  at  the
             Hearing without legal representation.   Her  husband  did  his
             best and came across as a credible witness.  He  has  provided
             tax calculations from the Revenue for 2011/2012 and  2012/2013
             which show he earned �31,954 and �23,809 in  those  respective
             years.  They also show that he had in fact overpaid tax due in
             each of those years, to the  extent  of  �147.61  and  �691.84
             respectively.  N.I. contributions due  by  31.01.14  are  also
             shown to have been paid ahead of time,  on  15.11.13,  through
             Newman Street Post Office.  Again, with the  reference  number
             given  on  these  Revenue  documents  (11834  55029)  and  the
             Sponsor's name, it is difficult to believe that they  are  not
             genuine, not least because the  Sponsor  would  be  likely  to
             realise that their genuineness might well be  checked  by  the
             Respondent and that, were they found to be false, he would not
             be likely to be allowed to have a family like in the  U.K.  in
             the foreseeable future.


         22.  I find that the marriage  is  genuine  and  lawful,  that  the
             Sponsor was divorced from his former wife some years  ago  and
             that he has been earning more than the Rules require  and  has
             an income substantially more than the c.�13-14,000  per  annum
             he would be likely to receive were he working for the  minimum
             legal hourly wage in the U.K.  There is, I find, no doubt that
             he can adequately maintain and  accommodate  himself  and  his
             wife.  The question is whether in these  circumstances  it  is
             reasonable and proportionate in  the  interests  of  effective
             immigration control to delay the couple's ability  to  have  a
             full family life in the U.K. where the Sponsor  is  a  British
             National.    I   conclude   that   it   would    be    neither
             disproportionate nor reasonable."

3.   Mr Jarvis submitted that the judge accepted that the appellant had  not
    produced the specified documents and therefore her  application  failed
    under the Immigration Rules.  He said that  this  is  relevant  because
    under Appendix FM E-ECP.3.1 under Financial Requirements the  appellant
    must provide specified evidence from the sources listed in Appendix  FM
    SE.A1(2)(a).   This  evidence  must  include  six   months'   financial
    documents prior to the date of application and this is a Rule specified
    in Rule 34G.  Appendix FM-SE makes plain that there is  an  expectation
    on the Secretary of State  that  an  ECO  will  see  all  the  relevant
    documentary  evidence  before  he  or  she  makes  the  decision.   The
    ECO/caseworker should be the primary decision-maker.

4.   Mr Jarvis relied  on  Shahzad  (Article  8:  legitimate  aim)  Pakistan
    [2014] UKUT 85 (IAC) which held at paragraph 31 as follows:

         "Where an  area  of  the  rules  does  not  have  such  an  express
         mechanism, the approach in R (Nagre) v Secretary of State  for  the
         Home Department [2013] EWHC 720 (Admin)  ([29]-[31]  in  particular
         and Gulshan (Article 8 - new Rules - correct approach) [2013]  UKUT
         640  (IAC)  should  be  followed:  that  is  after   applying   the
         requirements of the rules, only  if  there  may  be  arguably  good
         grounds for granting leave to remain outside them is  it  necessary
         for Article 8 purposes to go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
         compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them."


5.   Mr Jarvis submitted that under the deportation Rules the  Secretary  of
    State may grant leave where the criteria have not  been  met,  however,
    under Nagre and Gulshan the Immigration Rules have to be applied first.
      In  non-deportation  appeals  the  Secretary  of  State   refers   to
    exceptionality although that is not the legal test as made clear in FM,
    but the courts have accepted that there must  be  an  exceptional  test
    i.e. where the decision would lead to unjustifiably harsh consequences.

6.   Mr Jarvis submitted that it is plain that the First-tier Judge made  no
    reference to Article 8 outside  the  Immigration  Rules.   That  was  a
    material error.  He has  not  made  clear  why  there  are  exceptional
    circumstances or why the appellant should be granted leave outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  The Immigration Rules make clear what a person  has
    to satisfy.  Where an appellant does  not  do  that  absent  compelling
    circumstances, the appeal must be dismissed.  In this case many of  the
    relevant documents were put in after  the  application  was  made.   Mr
    Jarvis submitted that the judge's approach on proportionality  did  not
    follow the approach in Nagre and Shahzad.

7.   Counsel submitted that the First-tier Judge did not  allow  the  appeal
    under the Immigration Rules.  He allowed it under Article 8.   He  said
    that Appendix FM does not state that financial documents have to be six
    months before the date of application.  Under the 2002 Act a judge  can
    allow an appeal on the basis that the decision was  not  in  accordance
    with the Immigration Rules or the law.  There was  nothing  to  prevent
    the documents which were relevant to the evidence prior to the date  of
    application being considered by the judge.  He said  that  there  is  a
    distinction  between  a  substantive  requirement  and   a   procedural
    requirement.  If one does not meet the substantive requirement  it  may
    not be fatal.  The judge's findings at paragraph 22 were open to him on
    the evidence.

8.   I find that whilst Mr. Jarvis was right to submit  that  the  appellant
    did not produce with  her  application  the  specified  documents,  his
    reference to  Appendix  FM  SE  A1(2)(a)  was  incorrect  because  this
    particular subsection is  in  respect  of  a  salaried  employee.   The
    sponsor is a sole trader and not a  salaried  employee.   The  list  of
    documents to be produced by a sole trade is at Appendix  FM  SE  A1(7).
    In that list at 7(b)(ii) is Statement of Account (SA300 or  SA302)  and
    paperwork  from  HMRC,  which  the  sponsor  said  would  follow  "very
    shortly".  In the absence of these documents the  judge  rightly  found
    that the appellant's appeal must  fail  under  the  Immigration  Rules.
    Whilst I accept Counsel's submission that a judge can  under  the  2002
    Act allow an  appeal  on  the  basis  that  the  decision  was  not  in
    accordance with the Immigration Rules or the law,  the  judge  in  this
    case did not allow the appeal under the Immigration Rules  because  the
    appellant could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.  It
    follows therefore that the respondent's decision was in accordance with
    the Immigration Rules.

9.   I find that the judge materially erred in law in  allowing  the  appeal
    under Article 8 because he did not follow the  approach  identified  in
    paragraph 31 of Shahzad, which expressly approves the approach in Nagre
    and Gulshan. It is only if there  may  be  arguably  good  grounds  for
    granting leave outside the Immigration Rules that is  it  necessary  to
    for Article  8  purposes  to  go  on  to  consider  whether  there  are
    compelling circumstances not sufficiently recognised under them.

10.  Having found that the judge materially erred in law, I  set  aside  his
    decision on the appellant's Article 8 appeal and  remake  it.   On  the
    evidence I do not find that there is a compelling reason to  grant  the
    appellant entry clearance outside the Immigration Rules  under  Article
    8.  The delay in the couple's ability to have a full family  life  came
    about because the appellant failed to produce the  specified  financial
    documents with her application.  Had she done so, she  would  not  have
    been in this predicament.  It is up to the appellant to  make  a  fresh
    application in light of the positive findings  made  by  the  judge  in
    respect of her sponsor's finances.

11.  The appellant's appeal is dismissed.
