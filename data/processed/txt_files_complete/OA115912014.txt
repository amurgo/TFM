For the Respondent:    Mr M Diwnycz, Home Office Presenting Officer

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Introduction

 1. The Appellant is a male citizen of Pakistan born on 12th May 1989.   He
    applied for entry clearance to the United Kingdom as the husband of the
    Sponsor, Ambreen Kausar.  That application was refused for the  reasons
    given in a Notice of Decision dated 27th August  2014.   The  Appellant
    appealed, and his appeal was heard by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Thomas
    (the Judge) sitting at Birmingham on 12th May 2015.   She  allowed  the
    appeal under the  Immigration  Rules  for  the  reasons  given  in  her
    Decision dated 27th May 2015.  The Respondent sought  leave  to  appeal
    that decision, and on 4th August 2015 such permission was granted.

Error of Law

 2. I must first decide if the decision of the Judge contained an error  on
    a point of law so that it should be set aside.

 3. The sole issue before the Judge was whether there would  be  sufficient
    maintenance for the Appellant in accordance with paragraphs EC-C.1.1(d)
    and E-ECP.3.3(b) of Appendix FM of HC 395.  The Judge  found  that  the
    Sponsor was in receipt of a Carer's  Allowance  and  also  received  an
    income from her employment with Balti Night Limited.   The  application
    for entry clearance was refused on the basis that the Appellant had not
    submitted with his application the requisite  documentary  evidence  in
    respect of the Sponsor's earnings.  In particular,  the  Appellant  had
    not submitted the Sponsor's personal bank  statements  showing  entries
    corresponding to the Sponsor's  wage  slips.   The  Judge  allowed  the
    appeal on the basis  of  accepting  the  Sponsor's  evidence  that  her
    earnings were paid to her in cash and  were  not  paid  into  her  bank
    account as they were utilised in paying living expenses.

 4. At the hearing, Mr Diwnycz was content only to say by way of submission
    that he relied upon the grounds of application.  He explained  that  as
    the Sponsor was in receipt of Carer's Allowance, she  was  exempt  from
    the financial requirements imposed by paragraph E-ECP.3.3, but she  was
    required to show her earnings by submitting the evidence  specified  in
    Appendix FM-SE.1.(n).  As the Appellant had failed to include with  his
    application the Sponsor's  bank  statements  showing  receipts  of  her
    earnings, those earnings could not be taken into account.

 5. The Sponsor made a brief submission in response in which  she  repeated
    that she had been paid her earnings in cash and had saved the  cash  at
    home in order to meet living expenses.

 6. I find an error of law in the decision of the Judge which  I  therefore
    set aside.  The error of law is that the Judge was wrong to  take  into
    account when considering the Appellant's maintenance  the  earnings  of
    his wife from Balti Night Limited.  It is  irrelevant  that  the  Judge
    found that the Sponsor had such earnings.  Those earnings  should  have
    been excluded from the  Judge's  consideration  as  the  Appellant  had
    failed to comply with the  requirements  of  paragraph  FM-SE.1.(n)  of
    Appendix FM.

Remade Decision

 7. I proceeded to remake the decision in the appeal.  The only maintenance
    available to the Appellant and which could be taken  into  account  for
    the reasons explained  above  was  the  Sponsor's  receipt  of  Carer's
    Allowance of �59.75 per week.  This is less than the  threshold  figure
    of �18,600 per annum and therefore  the  appeal  must  fail  under  the
    provisions of paragraph EC-C.1.1 of Appendix FM of HC 395.   My  remade
    decision is that the appeal is dismissed.

Notice of Decision

 8. The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

 9. I set aside that decision.

10. I remake the decision in the appeal by dismissing it.

Anonymity

11.  The First-tier Tribunal did not make an order for  anonymity.   I  was
    not asked to do so and indeed I find no reason to do so.
