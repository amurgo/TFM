                            DECISION AND REASONS

1. This is an appeal brought on behalf of the appellant, having  been  given
   permission by First-tier Tribunal Judge Keane on 16 February 2018.

2. In short, this appeal concerns a refusal to grant entry clearance to  the
   appellant as the spouse of a refugee.

3. The decision appealed against was made on 2 December 2015. That  original
   decision was based upon the  limited  evidence  of  contact  between  the
   sponsor and the appellant; and that their relationship was not subsisting
   and that they did not intend to permanently live together.

4. The appellant appealed on the grounds that there was  ample  evidence  of
   contact between them as a couple and that  they  enjoyed  a  genuine  and
   subsisting relationship, rendering  the  decision  both  disproportionate
   and, as a result, an interference with their family life.

5. The appeal was listed before First-tier Tribunal Judge  Robertson  on  26
   June 2017. He found that the relevant family reunion requirements of  the
   Immigration Rules, in particular para 352A (iv), were not satisfied:

           352A. The requirements to be met by a person  seeking  leave  to
           enter or remain in  the  United  Kingdom  as  the  spouse  civil
           partner of a refugee are that:
           ...
           (iv) each of the parties intends to live  permanently  with  the
           other as his or her spouse civil partner  and  the  marriage  is
           subsisting; ...
                               [Rules cited as at the time of 2015 decision]

6. Having considered the evidence, Judge Robertson found that there  were  a
   number  of  inconsistencies  in  the  account  he  had  been  given;  and
   accordingly found that the couple were not in a  subsisting  relationship
   and did not have an intention to live together  permanently.   The  judge
   further found the decision was  both  proportionate  and  in  the  public
   interest.

7. In seeking permission to appeal, it was advanced: first, that  the  judge
   had failed to give reasons for findings on material matters; and  second,
   the judge had made a mistake  on  the  material  facts,  which  could  be
   established by objective evidence.  The  first  argument  rested  on  the
   suggestion that the sponsor's credibility had previously been accepted in
   full by the Secretary of State and it therefore made it more likely  that
   he was  telling  the  truth  about  his  wife,  something  that  was  not
   recognised in the decision. The second ground was  more  factual  in  its
   basis,  suggesting that the sponsor had not  been  in  contact  with  the
   appellant because she did not have a phone; that the  sponsor  could  not
   provide evidence of communication due to lack of funds;  that  there  had
   been regular contact since 2014, which was material;  that  the  decision
   went against the substantial evidence provided; and that it was  accepted
   that there had been regular contact between the sponsor and the appellant
   during the time he was in the UK, notwithstanding any delay in submitting
   the application (the full grounds of appeal are set out in the tribunal's
   bundle).

8. In granting permission to appeal, Judge Keane indicated that the  grounds
   disclosed an arguable error of law, which may have  led  to  a  different
   outcome, in particular that the  judge  had  arguably  failed  to  accord
   adequate weight to the considerations of the appeal before rejecting  the
   sponsor's evidence that he was party to a genuine and subsisting  marital
   relationship with the appellant.

9. The respondent opposes this appeal,  firstly,  on  the  ground  that  the
   judge directed  himself  appropriately;  and  secondly,  that  the  judge
   considered all of the evidence and reached  properly  reasoned  findings,
   open to him on that  evidence,  including  the  inconsistencies  that  he
   identified, which undermined the credibility of the sponsor's evidence.

10. It is against that background that this matter was listed before me.

11. The judge at first instance made a series  of  discernible  findings  of
   fact:

        i. The appellant is a national of Sudan, born 2 January 1988.
       ii. The appellant and her sponsor met in 2006.
      iii. They were married on 15 September 2010.  The  appellant  is  the
           sponsor's wife.
       iv. In November 2011, the sponsor left his wife in Sudan.
        v. In September 2012, the sponsor arrived in the UK.
       vi. On 5 July 2013, the sponsor was granted asylum in the UK.
      vii. It was after the grant of asylum in  2013  that  he  called  his
           mother's contact number at the family home.
     viii. The sponsor commenced work in the UK in January 2015.
       ix. The application for entry clearance was submitted  in  September
           2015.
        x. There was evidence of regular contact between the appellant  and
           the sponsor in the form of Whatsapp records from 2014;  and  the
           sponsor provided some financial support to the appellant by  way
           of money transfer.
       xi. On 2 December 2015, she  appealed  the  decision  of  the  entry
           clearance officer to refuse to  grant  entry  clearance  as  the
           spouse of a refugee.
      xii. The couple met up in Egypt (in 2017).
     xiii. The appellant has subsequently made  a  second  application  for
           entry clearance (outcome unknown).

12. Counsel asks me  to  find  a  material  error  of  law  in  the  judge's
   determination, and then asks me to remake the decision on  the  basis  of
   the evidence supplied and  fresh  evidence  submitted  before  the  Upper
   Tribunal hearing.

13. The material error of law is focused  on  what  are  said  to  be  clear
   contradictions in the decision. The example I was given was paragraph 14,
   where the judge accepted that  since  2014  the  evidence  suggested  the
   couple had been in regular contact and that the sponsor had provided some
   financial support. It was suggested  that  those  factors  supported  the
   credibility of the sponsor, in circumstances where the same judge had  in
   the same decision found him not to be credible.

14. While I understand the point, the fact that the judge accepted  evidence
   in  one  regard,  but  rejected  it  in  another   is   not   necessarily
   inconsistent. Appeals such as this have a myriad of factors. It is within
   the judges remit to identify the parts of the evidence which  he  or  she
   accepts, but equally to identify which parts of the evidence that  he  or
   she does not accept. In conducting such a balancing exercise,  the  judge
   is entitled to come down on one side or the other. That does not  mean  a
   judge is being inconsistent. On one view, it demonstrates  the  judge  is
   being fair. The judge sets out the matters  that  he  found  against  the
   appellant, and then included  the  factors  that  appear  to  favour  the
   appellant/sponsor's account.

15. It is apparent from the judge's determination that the  matters  against
   the appellant outweighed those in favour. I would have been more  alarmed
   had the judge not dealt with  the  matters  that  were  accepted.  It  is
   notwithstanding those factors that this appeal was refused.

16. In my judgement, Judge Robertson was entitled to  question  the  account
   he had been given about the time that the appellant and the  sponsor  had
   lived together. He found the sponsor to be unclear in this regard. It was
   a discrepancy that was not resolved in evidence. Further, it  appears  to
   me to be both reasonable and rational to look at the  amount  of  contact
   the sponsor and the appellant had after 2011 and up  to  2014.  He  notes
   that his mother had a contact number and this was, on one account,  where
   the appellant was living for a time. The  lack  of  contact  between  the
   appellant and the sponsor over a period of 2  ï¿½  years  between  November
   2011 and April 2014 was a relevant consideration the judge  was  entitled
   to take into account in balancing whether this was a subsisting  marriage
   where the parties intended to live  permanently  together.  Further,  the
   delay in submitting the application did have some relevance to the nature
   of the decision the judge was being asked to  make.  The  judge  was  not
   satisfied with the explanation for the delay.

17. I do not intend to reopen the facts, but  it  appears  to  me  that  the
   judge was applying the correct legal test and appropriately had  in  mind
   whether the marriage was subsisting and whether  they  intended  to  live
   permanently together. The burden was on the appellant in this regard. The
   judge identified the relevant factors that led him to make  the  decision
   he did. A judge is not required to deal with every aspect of the evidence
   or give reasons for their reasons.

18. While it was suggested to me that the common-sense view  was  that  they
   were in a subsisting marriage and were intending to live  together,  that
   was not directly the issue before  me.  The  judge  had  already  made  a
   finding of fact about that in  the  tribunal  below.  I  was  considering
   whether or not there had been an error  of  law  in  that  finding.  That
   another judge may have come to a different conclusion on those  facts  is
   secondary to whether or not this judge has come to an adequately reasoned
   decision that is correct in law.

19. The second contradiction I was asked to consider was that the judge  had
   found they were married, but then doubted whether  it  was  a  subsisting
   relationship. Once again, I can find  no  contradiction.  People  can  be
   married or go through the ceremony of marriage, but that  does  not  mean
   that they are in a subsisting or (on the amended  Rules)  a  genuine  and
   subsisting relationship. Nor does it follow, as was suggested, that 'as a
   result of their genuine and subsisting relationship, it was obvious  that
   they intended t live together permanently'. I simply do not accept  that,
   but more importantly, the fact-finding  tribunal  below  did  not  accept
   that.

20. The judge had reason to doubt the account given and has  explained  why.
   I would not seek to go behind that unless there was good reason for doing
   so. I cannot say that the judge gave insufficient weight to  the  various
   factors or competing considerations in this matter. It appears to me that
   the judge conducted a fair  balancing  exercise,  had  the  advantage  of
   seeing and hearing from the appellant and sponsor, and  then  came  to  a
   rational and reasoned conclusion.

21. The jurisdiction of the Upper Tribunal in this  regard  is  confined  to
   dealing with material errors of law (Tribunals Courts and Enforcement Act
   2007, s 12). Mere disagreement with the outcome at first instance  or  an
   appeal that proceeds on the basis that the appellant would like a  second
   bite at the cherry to re-argue the facts will seldom be sufficient unless
   a material error of law can be sustained first.  In the  instant  matter,
   the determination  makes  adequate  findings  of  fact,  is  sufficiently
   reasoned, and correctly applies the law.

22. Permission was not given on any other ground, so for the above  reasons,
   I dismiss this appeal.

23. For completeness, I was asked to admit  further  evidence,  pursuant  to
   rule 15(2)(A) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  on
   the basis that had I set aside the decision below, I may  have  been  re-
   deciding this appeal.

24. In the event, I do not reach that point, but for the avoidance of  doubt
   I was less than satisfied that that additional evidence would  have  made
   any material difference.  While  I  understand  that  the  appellant  and
   sponsor maintain that they now  have  a  daughter,  there  was  no  birth
   certificate or other document confirming parentage, and any  such  change
   could be dealt with by way of a second or further application.

NOTICE OF DECISION


The appellant's appeal is dismissed.

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal is confirmed.
