                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appears on behalf  of  an  Entry  Clearance
    Officer (post reference: SHEFO\157468)  against  the  decision  of  the
    First-tier Tribunal to allow on human  rights  grounds  the  claimant's
    appeal against the refusal of entry clearance as the spouse of a person
    present and settled here.  The First-tier  Tribunal  did  not  make  an
    anonymity direction, and I do not consider that  the  claimant  or  her
    spouse requires anonymity for these proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.





Relevant Background

 2. The claimant is a national of Nigeria, whose date of birth is 17  April
    1983.  On 31 July 2014 she married her  sponsor,  who  is  of  Nigerian
    heritage, in Nigeria.

 3. On 16 April 2015, the Entry Clearance  Officer  gave  his  reasons  for
    refusing her application for entry clearance as a spouse.  In order  to
    meet the financial requirements of Appendix FM, her  sponsor  needed  a
    gross income of at least  �18,600  per  annum.   She  stated  that  the
    sponsor had been employed by ISS UK Ltd since 3 August 2009,  and  that
    he earned an annual salary of �20,300.  However, she had  not  provided
    the specified evidence of salaried employment in the UK as specified in
    Appendix FM-SE.  As she had failed to provide  the  required  documents
    relating to her sponsor's employment, he was refusing  her  application
    under EC-P.1.1(d) of Appendix FM of the Rules.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer was also not satisfied that the appellant's
    relationship with the sponsor was genuine and subsisting, or that  they
    intended to live together permanently in the UK.

The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal

 5. The claimant's appeal came before Judge Wright sitting at Hatton  Cross
    on 3 February 2017.  There was no appearance on  behalf  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer.  The claimant was represented by Counsel. The  Judge
    received oral evidence from the sponsor.

 6. In his subsequent decision, he found that the claimant did not meet the
    requirements of the Rules, as  the  specified  evidence  had  not  been
    provided to show that he had a  claimed  gross  annual  income  of  the
    �20,300 per annum.  He also found that the claimed gross annual  income
    was insufficient to cover the actual amount required, which was in fact
    �18,600 plus an additional �3,800 for the child who had  been  born  in
    Nigeria before the Entry Clearance  Officer  made  a  decision  on  the
    application.

 7.  The  Judge  found  at  paragraph  [33}  that  whilst   the   competing
    proportionality considerations were "finely balanced", the claimant and
    her dependent child had shown:

         "that there are individual interests at stake covered by Article  8
         of a particularly pressing nature so as to give rise  to  a  strong
         claim that compelling circumstances may [in fact here do] exist  to
         justify the grant of LTE [Leave to enter] outside the  rules,  (see
         headnote 3 below of Kaur (visit appeals;  Article  8)  [2015]  UKUT
         00478 (IAC) (SIJ Storey)) and, therefore,  that  refusal  of  entry
         clearance  for  the  appellant  (and  her  dependent  child)  would
         constitute a disproportionate interference with ...  her  (and  her
         dependent child's) Article 8 rights ..."

The Application for Permission to Appeal

 8. In the application for permission to  appeal,  Juliet  McNamee  of  the
    Specialist Appeals Team pleaded that the  proportionality  balance  had
    not been undertaken correctly and therefore the decision to  allow  the
    appeal contained a material error of law.  She cited Dube (SS117A-117D)
    [2015] UKUT 0090 (IAC)  which  states  in  Headnote  1(a)  as  follows:
    "Judges are required statutorily to  take  into  account  a  number  of
    enumerated considerations.  Sections 117A-117D are not, therefore, an a
    la carte menu of considerations that it is at  the  discretion  of  the
    judge to apply or not apply.  Judges are duty bound to 'have regard' to
    the specified considerations."

The Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9.  On  11  September  2017,  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  Boyes   granted
    permission to appeal as the grounds asserted that the Judge had  failed
    to have regard to a number of matters, specifically S117 N1AA 2002, and
    he was satisfied that the grounds were arguable.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. In advance of the hearing in the Upper Tribunal, the  claimant's  legal
    representatives notified the Upper Tribunal that  the  claimant  wished
    the appeal to be dealt with on the papers.  Accordingly, they said they
    would not be making an appearance at the hearing.

11. Ms Pal submitted that the Judge had asked himself  the  wrong  question
    when considering proportionality.  He had failed  to  consider  whether
    there were insurmountable obstacles to family life being carried on  by
    the couple and their child in Nigeria.  She submitted that the decision
    should be set aside and remade by me in favour of the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, as the refusal decision was plainly proportionate.

The Reasons for Finding an Error of Law

12. The Judge painstakingly navigated his way through the  relevant  public
    interests considerations arising under section 117B of  the  2002  Act.
    Accordingly, I do not consider that he can be faulted on  the  asserted
    ground of non-compliance with the guidance given by the Upper  Tribunal
    in Dube.  However, as is also  pleaded  in  the  Secretary  of  State's
    grounds of  appeal,  I  consider  that  the  proportionality  balancing
    exercise was not correctly undertaken.

13. The Judge  brought  into  the  proportionality  balancing  exercise  an
    irrelevant consideration, which was whether it was reasonable to expect
    the British national sponsor to leave the UK in order  to  be  able  to
    enjoy family life with the claimant and their child in  Nigeria.   This
    is not a question which arises under section 117B, and it was also  not
    the right  question  when  the  judicial  decision-maker  is  assessing
    whether there are sufficiently compelling circumstances to justify  the
    grant of entry clearance of a spouse who has not shown that  she  meets
    the minimum income requirement ("MIR").

14. Under the Rules, if a spouse who is seeking leave to  remain  does  not
    satisfy the MIR, then the only other basis  on  which  the  spouse  can
    qualify for leave to remain is if EX.1 applies.  EX.1 cannot be brought
    directly to bear in an  entry  clearance  application.  However,  in  a
    proportionality assessment outside the Rules, the question  of  whether
    there are insurmountable obstacles to family life being carried  on  in
    the applicant's home  country  is  an  essential  element  in  deciding
    whether the refusal  leads  to  an  unreasonable  and  disproportionate
    outcome.

15. Apart from addressing the wrong question at the wrong stage, the  Judge
    also did not give  adequate  reasons  for  holding  that  it  would  be
    unreasonable for family life to be carried on in Nigeria.  The  Judge's
    reasoning was that it would be unreasonable for the sponsor -  who  had
    lived in the UK for 13 years since July 2003, who had become a  British
    citizen by naturalisation, and who was in gainful employment - to leave
    the UK simply in order to  be  able  to  enjoy  family  life  with  the
    claimant and their child  in  Nigeria.   But  this  line  of  reasoning
    overlooks the fact that the MIR applies to all  British  nationals  and
    settled migrants, however long they have lived in the UK,  and  however
    remote their connection to the country of origin of the  third  country
    spouse.  Given the common Nigerian heritage of the couple, and the fact
    that they would have entered into marriage in 2014 with  no  legitimate
    expectation of being able to carry on family life in the UK unless  all
    the relevant requirements of the Rules were met, the Judge's finding of
    unreasonableness borders on the perverse.

16. The balancing exercise is further flawed in that the  Judge  failed  to
    take into account: (a) that the effect of the refusal was  to  preserve
    the status quo; and (b) that the interference  with  family  life  need
    only be temporary, as it was open to  the  claimant  to  make  a  fresh
    application for entry clearance relying on further and better  evidence
    of her sponsor earning �20,300 per annum.

17. For the above reasons, I find  that  the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal was vitiated by a material error of law, such that it must  be
    set aside and remade.

The Remaking of the Decision

18. In the normal course of events, where the Upper Tribunal finds an error
    of law in an Article 8 case, the Upper Tribunal  will  proceed  at  the
    same hearing to remake the decision.   There  is  no  good  reason  for
    departing from this practice in the present appeal, especially as there
    is no issue of fact which needs to be resolved.

19. The claimant has at all material times been legally represented, and so
    I infer that she is content for  the  decision  to  be  remade  on  the
    papers, taking into account the findings of primary fact  made  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal, none of which are controversial or the subject  of
    challenge.

20. The claimant has not shown she meets the MIR as she  has  not  provided
    the mandatory specified evidence  to  show  that  her  sponsor's  gross
    annual salary is �20,300.  Appendix FM does not  require  her  to  show
    that the sponsor is earning an additional �3,800 for their first child,
    if the child is a British citizen. However, this is academic as she has
    not discharged the burden of proving that her sponsor has  a  specified
    gross annual income of at least �18,600.

21. Turning to an  Article  8  claim  outside  the  Rules,  I  accept  that
    questions 1 and 2  of  the  Razgar  test  should  be  answered  in  the
    claimant's favour, as the effect of the refusal decision is to  prevent
    family life being continued in the UK,  albeit  that  the  interference
    will not necessarily be long-term or even medium-term.  Questions 3 and
    4 of the Razgar test must be answered in favour of the respondent.   On
    the issue of proportionality, I take into account the  relevant  public
    interest considerations arising under section 117B of the  2002,  while
    observing that they are mainly directed to cases of expulsion,  not  to
    cases of exclusion.

22. I accept that it is in the child's best interests to be  cared  for  by
    both parents. However, there are not insurmountable obstacles to family
    life with both parents being carried on in Nigeria.   Moreover,  it  is
    not suggested that the child's wellbeing or welfare is  jeopardised  by
    her mother continuing to be her primary carer in Nigeria.

23. Thus, the public interest considerations in favour of  the  maintenance
    of the status quo do not have  to  be  strong  in  order  to  make  the
    continued exclusion of the mother a proportionate outcome.

24. The couple did not have a legitimate expectation of being able to carry
    on family life in the UK, with or  without  a  child  of  their  union,
    unless they could show that the MIR was met.  No excuse has  ever  been
    offered as to why the missing specified evidence was  not  provided  by
    way of appeal.  On the face of it, there should be no difficulty in the
    provision of the mandatory specified documents.

25. I note that the grounds of appeal to the First-tier  Tribunal  did  not
    engage with the Entry Clearance Officer's reasons for finding that  the
    MIR was  not  met.   The  legal  representatives  simply  made  a  bald
    assertion that the sponsor was earning �20,300 per annum, and that this
    was more than enough for the couple and the child to  live  in  the  UK
    without recourse to public funds.

26. I also note that a similar line was taken by Counsel  at  the  hearing.
    According to paragraph [14] of the Judge's decision, she submitted that
    the appeal should be allowed outside the Rules simply  on  the  grounds
    that the sponsor was telling the  truth  in  claiming  that  his  gross
    annual income was �20,300.

27. I do not consider that the claimant made out an  arguable  case  before
    the  First-tier  Tribunal  that  there  were  sufficiently   compelling
    circumstances in her case such that the refusal was disproportionate.

28. I have considered the observations of the Supreme Court in MM  (Lebanon
    and Others) [2017] UKSE 10, and I find that  they  do  not  assist  the
    claimant on remaking.  If the sponsor is earning  �20,300  as  claimed,
    there is no good reason why the mandatory evidence to demonstrate  this
    cannot be provided in support of a fresh application.

29. I consider that the decision appealed against strikes  a  fair  balance
    between, on the one hand, the rights and interests of the claimant  and
    affected family members, and, on the other hand, the wider interests of
    society.  It is proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be
    achieved, which is the protection of the country's  economic  wellbeing
    and the maintenance of firm and effective immigration controls.
