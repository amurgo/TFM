                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against  the  determination  of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Porter, promulgated on 22nd November 2016, following a hearing at
    Hatton Cross on 19th September 2016.  In the determination, the  judge
    dismissed  the  appeal  of  the  Appellant,  whereupon  the   Appellant
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of India, who  was  born  on  14th
    November 1982.  She appealed against the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    Secretary of State dated 7th May 2015,  refusing  her  application  for
    leave to remain in the UK indefinitely  on  the  basis  of  ten  years'
    continuous lawful residency in this country.

The Judge's Determination

 3. The judge properly set out the legal requirements for indefinite  leave
    to remain in the UK on the ground of long residence,  by  reference  to
    paragraph 276B(i)(a) of the Immigration Rules before proceeding to make
    findings of fact (paragraph 24).  The conclusion reached by  the  judge
    was that the Appellant  had  not  demonstrated  ten  years'  continuous
    lawful residence in the UK from the period 12th August 2010 until  28th
    February 2011 (see paragraph 25) and the reasons for this were that she
    had been asked at question L6 of the relevant form to confirm that  she
    had ï¿½800 for each calendar month of their course up  to  a  maximum  of
    nine months, in order to meet the  maintenance  requirements,  and  the
    Appellant had not completed this section at L6.  The judge  held  that,
    with respect to this information, "there is no suggestion that this was
    otherwise available in this application form" (paragraph 27).  This was
    an Appellant who had previously made many applications  for  leave  and
    "she should and would  have  been  aware  of  the  importance  of  such
    information and would have ensured that  this  was  available  to  her"
    (paragraph 29).

 4. The appeal was dismissed.

Grounds of Application

 5. The grounds of application state that it was not open to the  judge  to
    exercise discretion  as  the  primary  decision  maker,  and  that  the
    guidance as to whether any gap in  lawful  residence  was  outside  the
    Appellant's control had been restrictively applied,  and  there  was  a
    misunderstanding of the cause of  the  gap  in  residence  and  that  a
    material  submission  for  the  Appellant  was  not  addressed  in  the
    determination.

 6. On 28th July 2017, the Upper Tribunal gave permission to appeal.

 7. On 17th August 2017, a Rule 24 response was entered by  the  Respondent
    to the effect that discretion had been considered by the  Secretary  of
    State, but was not  extended  in  the  Appellant's  favour  during  the
    consideration of the Appellant's application.

 8. It was open to the judge to consider the exercise of  the  Respondent's
    discretion  and  find  that  it  was  exercised  properly:   see   Ukus
    (discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT 00307.





Submissions

 9. At the hearing before me on 29th September 2017, Mr Farhat, of Counsel,
    appearing on behalf of  the  Appellant  relied  upon  his  grounds  for
    permission to appeal.

10. First, this was a case where, in a long  residence  application,  there
    was a gap of six months and fourteen days  in  the  Appellant's  lawful
    residence, from 11th August 2010 until 28th February 2011, which  meant
    that she could not succeed under the Immigration Rules.

11. Second, however, policy guidance gave the Secretary of State discretion
    to overlook periods of overstaying of over 28 days.  Mr Farhat drew  my
    attention to page 6 of the grounds of application, where  paragraph  33
    sets  out  the  relevant  guidance  under  the  heading   "periods   of
    overstaying" and states that,

         "When refusing an application on the grounds  it  was  made  by  an
         applicant who has  overstayed  by  more  than  28  days,  you  must
         consider any evidence of exceptional circumstances which  prevented
         the  applicant  from  applying  within  the  first   28   days   of
         overstaying".

12. The guidance goes  on  to  state  that  what  constitutes  "exceptional
    circumstances" is a high threshold  but  this  "could  include"  delays
    resulting from "unexpected or unforeseeable causes".

13. Third, if one looks at the  Appellant's  circumstances,  she  made  her
    application on 30th July 2010.  This was on time.  She did not in  that
    application, however, answer one question on the  application,  namely,
    L6 (which appears at page 9 of the grounds), and  Mr  Farhat  submitted
    that this was the only error on the application form.  The Secretary of
    State then, however, returned the entire application form back  to  the
    Appellant on 11th August 2010, which was some eleven  days  later,  and
    this culminated in the period of her overstaying beginning to run.   It
    was, submitted Mr Farhat, no blemish on the Appellant herself.  She had
    applied on time and she had applied on the correct form,  and  she  had
    applied without having overstayed in any way.

14. Fourth, this was, however, an irrelevancy to all intents and  purposes.
    This is because the Secretary of  State  refused  the  application,  in
    breach of the Secretary of State's own policy, and it is this which led
    to the period of overstaying.  Discretion should have been exercised.

15. Fifth, it is a  mistake  of  fact  that  the  information  required  by
    question L6 was not available in the application itself, though  I  had
    to be accepted it was  not  available  on  the  form,  because  it  was
    appended  to  the  application  form  itself.   It  consisted  of   the
    Appellant's passport which had also the CAS as well as other documents.
     Therefore, the Secretary of State had  the  information  required  and
    ought to have exercised discretion  in  the  Appellant's  favour.   The
    reference in the Secretary of State's  own  policy  to  "unexpected  or
    unforeseeable causes", was a reference to that  which  "could  include"
    such exceptional circumstances.

16. Finally, and in any event, the Secretary of State could have asked  for
    the information anyway, if it was not in response to question  L6,  but
    was included in the documents appended to  the  application  form.   Mr
    Farhat submitted that I should make a finding of an error  of  law  and
    remit this matter back to the Secretary of State so that discretion can
    be exercised with a view to determining the application on the basis of
    the information as provided in the appended documents.

17. For his part, Mr Staunton submitted that he would rely upon the refusal
    letter.  He submitted that the  question  of  discretion  was  for  the
    Secretary of State.  Further, in this case it was not the judge who was
    exercising the discretion because it was for the Secretary of State  to
    so exercise it.  In any event, discretion had been  exercised  but  had
    not been exercised in the Appellant's favour, and this was  clear  from
    page 5 of the refusal letter.

18. In reply, Mr Farhat submitted that what was clear was that,  under  the
    policy, the Secretary of State "may" exercise discretion.  The question
    thereafter was what reasons there would be for the Secretary  of  State
    exercising such a discretion.  In this case there were clearly  reasons
    because the CAS information was provided with the application form  and
    the Secretary of State plainly did not exercise  her  discretion.   She
    did not look at the application in its entirety.  It was  not  inquired
    as to what amount of money the Appellant had.

19. Yet, all this information was  in  the  application  itself.   In  Ukus
    (discretion: when reviewable) [2012] UKUT 00307, the Tribunal had  held
    that,  "because  the  discretion  is  vested  in  the  executive,   the
    appropriate course would be for the Tribunal to  require  the  decision
    maker to complete his  task  by  reaching  a  lawful  decision  on  the
    outstanding application ..." (at paragraph 2).

20. In this case, submitted Mr Farhat, what was not open to  the  Secretary
    of State was to just reject the application because under  the  policy,
    there  is  a  section  "specified  application  forms  and   procedure:
    mandatory sections", which is to the effect that, "you must not  reject
    an application if an applicant fails to complete non-mandatory sections
    of the application form".

21. Yet, this is exactly what the Secretary of State  had  done.   She  had
    rejected the application.  The policy  required  the  applicant  to  be
    given one chance to complete all  the  mandatory  sections  and  answer
    every question within ten business days if requested to do so.

Error of Law

22. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by  the  judge  involved
    the making of an error on a point of law (see  Section  12(1)  of  TCEA
    2007) such that I should set aside the decision.   My  reasons  are  as
    follows.

23. This is a case where the Appellant  did  not  complete  the  answer  to
    question  L6.   This  was  an  important  question.   It  required  the
    applicant as a student to show that she  had  ï¿½800  for  each  calendar
    month available to her during the course.  The failure to complete this
    section was arguably an act of negligence on her part  given  that,  as
    the judge properly stated, she was not a novice in this respect  having
    made other applications on previous occasions (see paragraph 29).

24. Nevertheless, the information was, it would  appear,  appended  in  the
    attached documentation to  the  application  form,  together  with  her
    passport.  But even if it was  not,  the  Secretary  of  State  had  to
    exercise her discretion by contacting the  applicant  and  ask  her  to
    furnish the missing information.  It was not open to the  Secretary  of
    State, as the guidance makes clear, to reject the application outright.



25. Accordingly, the appropriate course of action now is for the  Secretary
    of State to exercise the discretion that she is duty  bound  under  the
    law to exercise,  and  if  the  information  is  found  not  to  be  in
    existence, then the decision by the Secretary of State will fall to  be
    made accordingly.

26. If on the other hand the information is there, then the discretion  may
    go the other way.  The fact remains, however, that discretion  must  be
    exercised by the Secretary of State.

Notice of Decision

27. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an error
    of law such that it falls to be set aside.  I set aside the decision of
    the original judge.  I allow this appeal to the extent  that  I  direct
    that the Secretary of State consider the application on  the  basis  of
    all the information  provided  in  the  application,  and  not  confine
    herself to the form itself and the answer to question L6, as appears to
    have been done to date.

28. No anonymity direction is made.

29. The appeal is allowed.
