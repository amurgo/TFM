                                                                  Respondent


For the Appellant:       Mr A Devlin, Advocate, instructed by Neil Barnes,
Solicitor
For the Respondent:      Mr A Mullen, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1) The appellant identifies himself as a citizen  of  Eritrea,  born  on  20
   December 1985.  By notice dated 27 August 2012,  the  respondent  refused
   his application, made from Sudan, to enter the UK  for  the  purposes  of
   settlement as the dependent relative  (the  brother)  of  a  person  with
   limited leave to  remain  as  a  refugee  under  paragraph  319Z  of  the
   Immigration Rules.   The decision does not mention Article 8 of the ECHR.

2) The appellant appealed to the First-tier Tribunal.  His  grounds  do  not
   mention  the  Rules.   They  state  that  refusal  of   entry   clearance
   "constitutes a disproportionate interference with the Article 8 rights of
   the appellant and the  sponsor.   The  appellant  cannot  now  return  to
   Eritrea and so cannot turn to other relatives for support."

3) First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Morrow  refused  the  appellant's  appeal  by
   determination dated 22 April 2013.

4) Permission to  appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal  was  granted,  on  these
   grounds:

    1. The alleged discrepancy in respect of the money transfers  does  not
       exist.  The Immigration Judge has misapprehended the evidence before
       him.  At the time of making the  statement  the  sponsor  was  quite
       correct in stating that money was sent directly to his brother.  The
       earlier transfers were made to the sponsor's wife, who at that  time
       was living in Sudan with the appellant.  This was evidenced  in  the
       sponsor's statement at item 2 of the appeal bundle, and the identity
       of the sponsor's wife was confirmed at item  7  in  the  appellant's
       bundle.  In short money was sent to the sponsor's wife while she was
       in Sudan, and after she left Sudan, having obtained entry  clearance
       under paragraph  352  of  the  Immigration  Rules,  money  was  sent
       directly to the appellant.  There is no contradiction.   Accordingly
       the Tribunal has materially erred in law by making  a  finding  that
       cannot be supported on the evidence.


    2. The findings in respect of the  appellant's  illness  are  perverse.
       All medical reports obtained by a party to litigation  are  obtained
       "at their wish".  That cannot be a proper reason  for  dismissing  a
       report.  It is further submitted that there  is  not  a  significant
       difference in the two reports, and that even if there were, the  two
       reports are dated a year apart.  The  respondent  was  unrepresented
       and the point about the medical reports was not put to the  sponsor.
       There was no opportunity to explain the alleged  discrepancy.   This
       is a material error of law in light of the case of Mehmet  Koca  [no
       citation given].  There may well be a  cogent  explanation  for  the
       discrepancy, but no one has had the chance to advance it.

    3. The findings at paragraph 9 of the determination  disclose  material
       error in law.  If family life is accepted, and  there  are  no  good
       reasons in this case why  it  should  not  be,  then  Article  8  is
       engaged.  The evidence of the sponsor in his screening interview and
       his statement was that the appellant is part  of  his  family  unit.
       The unchallenged evidence of the sponsor was that the appellant left
       Eritrea  illegally  with  the  sponsor's  wife  and  children.   The
       Immigration  Judge  appears  to  have  ignored  the  fact  that  the
       appellant is a minor living alone in  a  country  where  he  remains
       vulnerable to deportation to Eritrea, a country from which he exited
       illegally.  The Immigration Judge's assessment of proportionality is
       simply wrong in fact and law, ignoring the evidence of the  sponsor,
       the objective country material before him, and the question  of  the
       best interests of the child.

Submissions for appellant.

5) Mr Devlin drew attention to the evidence of  the  money  transfers,  made
   firstly to the sponsor's wife and later to another recipient.   The  date
   of the  change  corresponded  with  the  date  when  the  sponsor's  wife
   travelled to the UK, and with the sponsor's evidence.  The judge erred in
   identifying a discrepancy. The medical reports were  largely  in  similar
   terms, and not contradictory of one another.  The second  report  was  14
   months after the first, and the only difference was that it said that the
   appellant could not walk independently.  It was  unfortunately  not  made
   clear what assistance he required with walking, but that was not  a  true
   discrepancy, and might well be explained  by  the  appellant's  condition
   being described at two different dates, and having  deteriorated  in  the
   meantime.  The error could be seen as one of procedural unfairness, or as
   one of failure to take account of a relevant consideration,  namely  that
   the reports were made almost a year apart.

6) Mr Devlin then turned to what he said was the most significant  error  in
   the  determination,  in  relation  to  Article  8.   The   grounds   were
   interrelated, because the judge's only reason  at  paragraph  9  for  not
   accepting that family life existed turned on the reasons discussed above,
   now be shown to be erroneous.  It was accepted that the  appellant  could
   not meet the Immigration Rules, so the next question was whether  he  had
   any Article 8 case  outwith  the  Rules  to  be  considered.   Mr  Devlin
   referred to Izuazu [2013] UKUT 00045 (IAC),  which  follows  on  from  MF
   [2012] 00393 (IAC), holding that where  a  claimant  does  not  meet  the
   requirements of the Rules it is necessary to assess Article  8  "applying
   the criteria established by law".

7) In MS [2013] CSIH 52 the Court said:

    The decision maker should examine the circumstances put forward by  the
    applicant and determine whether they disclose a good arguable case that
    the Rules would produce an unfair or disproportionate result such  that
    the applicant's Article 8 rights would be infringed.   It  is  only  if
    that test is satisfied that there is any need to go on to consider  the
    application of Article 8 in detail.


8) Mr Devlin said that while that referred to a decision maker  employed  by
   the Secretary of State,  the  same  principle  applied  on  appeal.   The
   present circumstances amount to a good arguable  case.   He  referred  to
   Mundeba [2013] UKUT 00088 for the proposition that although  this  is  an
   out of country case, it still requires consideration of the child's  best
   interests.  Reliance was placed on headnote (iii):

    Although the statutory duty under section 55 of the UK Borders Act 2009
    only applies to children within the  UK,  the  broader  duty  doubtless
    explains why the Secretary  of  State's  IDI  invites  Entry  Clearance
    Officers to consider the statutory guidance issued under section 55.


9) Turning to the European jurisprudence, Mr Devlin said  this  brought  out
   general principles that in an entry case a proper analysis did not  focus
   on whether and to what extent there would  be  interference  with  family
   life, but on whether the state's positive obligation  to  promote  family
   life was engaged.  The focus should be on whether the state has a duty to
   facilitate a family reunification.   The extent of a  state's  obligation
   to  admit  relatives  varies  according  to  the  circumstances.   It  is
   recognised that a state has the right to control  the  entry  of  foreign
   nationals, and that Article 8 does not impose an obligation to respect  a
   choice  of  matrimonial  residence  or  to  authorise  reunion  on  state
   territory.  Mr Devlin referred to Sen v Netherlands [2003] 36 EHRR  7  at
   paragraph 37:

    In its analysis, the court takes into  consideration  the  age  of  the
    children concerned, their situation in  their  country  of  origin  and
    their degree of dependence on  their  parents.   It  cannot  in  effect
    consider the matter from the sole point  of  view  of  immigration,  by
    comparing this situation with that of persons who have only established
    family bonds after becoming settled in their host country.



10) The next reference  was  to  Toquoabo-Tekle  and  Others  v  Netherlands
   [2005] ECHR 803 at paragraph 49:

    The  court  has  indeed  previously  rejected  cases  involving  failed
    applications for family reunion and complaints under  Article  8  where
    the children concerned had in the meantime reached  an  age  when  they
    were presumably not as much in need  of  care  as  young  children  and
    increasingly able to fend for themselves.  In cases of this nature, the
    court has also examined whether  the  children  had  grown  up  in  the
    cultural and linguistic environment of their country of origin, whether
    they had other relatives there, and whether it could  expected  of  the
    parents to return to that country.


11) Relevant issues were an older child's ability to self-care, the  ability
   of relatives to return to join the child,  whether  relatives  left  that
   country voluntarily, and whether they had legal permission to  be  there.
   A voluntary departure  was  against  a  state's  positive  obligation  to
   facilitate reunion.  The acquisition of a permanent abode  was  a  strong
   factor in favour of a positive obligation.

12) Mr Devlin next turned to the factors which  he  said  were  relevant  to
   this case.  The sponsor's statement, although brief, disclosed  that  the
   appellant is a child who although he has reached the  age  of  17  (which
   would  ordinarily  tend  against  a  positive  obligation)  suffers  from
   cerebral palsy. The appellant was born in Eritrea but is  now  living  in
   Sudan, not his  country  of  cultural  and  linguistic  upbringing.   The
   appellant has refugee status in Sudan, although he appears no  longer  to
   be living in a refugee camp but in another community.   However,  he  and
   his carer are struggling to survive even with financial support from  the
   UK.  The appellant's relatives are now not in Sudan but in  the  UK.   It
   appears that his mother is deceased and his father  is  in  detention  in
   Eritrea.  His relatives are here not voluntarily but through the  process
   of refugee recognition and reunion.  His relatives could  not  reasonably
   be expected to return to Eritrea, and it is at least doubtful whether  it
   was open to them to return to Sudan.   All  these  circumstances  made  a
   powerful case in favour of a positive obligation  on  the  state.   While
   that had to be balanced with the UK interest in immigration  control  and
   the fact  that  the  appellant  does  not  meet  the  Rules,  there  were
   individual interests outweighing the state interest.

13) The final case to which Mr Devlin referred  was  Berisha  v  Switzerland
   (Application No 948/12),  30  July  2013,  in  particular  paragraphs  56
   onwards:
      56.  The  Court  has  previously  rejected  cases   involving   failed
      applications for family reunification and complaints under  Article  8
      where the children concerned had in the meantime reached an age  where
      they were presumably not as much in need of care as young children and
      were increasingly able to  fend  for  themselves.  In  cases  of  this
      nature, the Court has also examined whether the children have grown up
      in the cultural and linguistic environment of their country of origin,
      whether they have other relatives  there,  and  whether  it  could  be
      expected that the parents would  return  to  that  country  (see,  for
      instance, Benamar v. the Netherlands (dec.),  no.  43786/04,  5 April
      2005; I.M. v. the Netherlands (dec.), no. 41266/98, 25 March 2003; and
      Chandra  and  Others  v.  the  Netherlands   (dec.),   no.   53102/99,
      13 May 2003).
      57.  By contrast, in Sen (cited above), which concerned  parents  who
      had left their daughter behind in the care of relatives in their  home
      country of Turkey to settle in the Netherlands, the Court  established
      that the applicants were facing major obstacles to a return  to  their
      home country since they had been legally resident in  the  Netherlands
      for many years; their two youngest children had been born and  brought
      up there and were attending school. With regard to those children, who
      had minimal ties with their home country, and in view of the young age
      of the daughter who had remained in Turkey (she  was  nine  years  old
      when the application to the domestic authorities was made), the  Court
      considered it more  appropriate  to  let  the  daughter  come  to  the
      Netherlands to be reunited with her family there.  The  refusal  of  a
      residence permit for the daughter had  therefore  been  in  breach  of
      Article 8 of the Convention (ibid. �� 39-42).
      58.  Moreover, in the case of Tuquabo-Tekle and Others, (cited above,
      �� 47-52), the Court found a violation of Article 8 of the Convention
      regarding the refusal of a residence permit on the  ground  of  family
      reunification to Mrs Tuquabo-Tekle's daughter, who was, at the time of
      the domestic application,  already  fifteen  years  old.  As  well  as
      establishing that the parents were facing major obstacles to a  return
      to their  country  of  origin,  Eritrea,  the  Court  ruled  that  the
      particular circumstances of  the  daughter's  situation  in  her  home
      country - her grandmother, who was taking care of her, had  taken  her
      out of school and she had reached an age where she  could  be  married
      off - were such that she should be allowed to  be  reunited  with  her
      family in the Netherlands. The  Court  held  in  that  case  that  the
      daughter's age should not be the sole element that led to a  different
      assessment from that arrived at in the case of Sen (cited  above),  in
      which the daughter had been some years younger.
      59.  Turning to the present application, the  Court  notes  that  as,
      inter alia, in the case of  Sen  (cited  above),  the  applicants  are
      living where they are because of their conscious decision to settle in
      Switzerland rather than remain in  their  home  country.  After  their
      marriage in 2007, the second applicant joined her husband,  the  first
      applicant, who had already been living in Switzerland  for  ten  years
      and was in possession of a permanent residence permit, with the aim of
      establishing a family life there. Subsequently,  a  fourth  child  was
      born to them and  the  second  applicant  also  received  a  permanent
      residence permit for Switzerland. Nevertheless,  the  applicants  were
      not prevented from maintaining the degree of family life they had  had
      for many years before 2007. After the first  applicant  had  moved  to
      Switzerland in 1997, he had  visited  the  second  applicant  and  his
      children regularly and had a third child with the second applicant  in
      2003. He had also supported them financially.
      60.  As regards the  situation  of  the  three  children,  the  Court
      considers that, despite the applicants' contentions, they  must  still
      have solid social and linguistic ties to  their  home  country,  where
      they grew up and went to school for many years. Although the  children
      are now also well integrated in Switzerland, the Court is of the  view
      that their period of stay in the respondent State is not  long  enough
      for them to have completely lost their  ties  with  their  country  of
      origin. With regard to the fact that their  grandmother  looked  after
      them for more than two years and is, after  all,  still  living  there
      now, it must also be assumed that they  have  strong  family  ties  to
      Kosovo. Furthermore, the applicants have not disputed that L.'s health
      has in fact improved to the extent that it would not  be  a  hindrance
      for her to return to her home country, and, with regard to the alleged
      financial dependence of R. on the applicants, the Court cannot see why
      he, as well as his sister, could  not  be  supported  at  a  distance,
      especially when it is considered that they are now 19 and 17 years old
      respectively. Lastly, with particular regard to the  youngest  of  the
      three children, B., the  Court  notes  that  the  applicants  are  not
      prevented from travelling - or even staying - with her  in  Kosovo  in
      order to ensure that she is  provided  with  the  necessary  care  and
      education so that her best interests as a child are safeguarded.
      61.  In conclusion, and also  taking  into  account  the  applicants'
      conduct in the domestic proceedings, which was not irreproachable,  it
      cannot be found that the respondent State has failed to strike a  fair
      balance between the applicants' interest in  family  reunification  on
      the one hand and its own interest in controlling  immigration  on  the
      other. Although it may well be that the  applicants  would  prefer  to
      maintain and intensify their family links with the three  children  in
      Switzerland, Article 8 does not guarantee a right to choose  the  most
      suitable place to develop family life (see  above,  ��  48,  49).  The
      respondent  State  has  therefore  not  overstepped  the   margin   of
      appreciation it enjoys under Article 8 of the Convention.
      62.  It follows that no violation of Article 8 can be  found  on  the
      facts of the present case.
14) Mr Devlin observed that although  this  appellant  is  aged  17,  he  is
   significantly disabled.  His carer in Sudan is no  longer  able  to  look
   after him, through her own ill-health.  There can be  no  return  to  the
   appellant's home country and he has no remaining family links in Eritrea.
    He is  in  need  of  medical  and  social  care  as  well  as  financial
   assistance.  While each case is different, Berisha shows  the  nature  of
   the factors which may come into  play,  and  this  falls  closer  to  the
   successful than to the unsuccessful instances in the European court.

15) Mr Devlin said that the grounds should all be  upheld,  and  a  decision
   should be substituted taking into account the best interests of the child
   and the Strasbourg jurisprudence on the positive obligation  which  could
   arise to admit an applicant.  The First-tier Tribunal decision fell to be
   reversed.

16) I asked Mr Devlin to clarify where  the  appellant  fell  short  of  the
   Immigration Rules.  Mr Devlin said that the appellant did not  fall  into
   the class of dependent relatives eligible for admission by way of  family
   reunion, and that even if he did fall into a category  for  admission  he
   could  not  succeed  in  meeting  the   accommodation   and   maintenance
   requirements.  I further enquired whether the Rules  could  be  taken  as
   broadly incorporating any of the  Strasbourg  jurisprudence.   Mr  Devlin
   submitted that there could always be cases outwith the Rules, on the test
   of a strong arguable case.  This case under the Rules produced  a  result
   contrary to the Strasbourg jurisprudence and therefore fell to be allowed
   outwith the Rules.  The appellant although he was  only  a  sibling  fell
   within the sponsor's pre-existing family unit.

17) I also enquired whether the likely cost of the appellant's care  in  the
   UK would be of any relevance.   Mr  Devlin  accepted  that  it  was  only
   realistic to expect that there would be costs, and that  was  a  relevant
   consideration,  but  said  that  nevertheless  the  balance   was   still
   significantly in favour of the appellant.  He was anxious  to  point  out
   that this is not a straightforward health case,  because  of  course  the
   appellant could not meet the high test  required  by  N  v  UK.   It  was
   nevertheless material to consider the medical aspects of  the  impact  on
   his physical and mental integrity in  terms  of  Article  8.   Mr  Devlin
   accepted that the case would be more difficult if it concerned a  healthy
   17 year old, perhaps able to make his own living, but he  said  that  the
   appellant did not found primarily on his medical condition.  Although the
   medical condition is a  compassionate  circumstance  on  the  appellant's
   side, his case is fundamentally based on family life and not  on  medical
   considerations.  The positive obligation on the UK state  did  not  arise
   because of the appellant's need for medical treatment.

Submissions for respondent.

18) Mr Mullen firstly sought to argue that there is  no  error  of  law,  or
   alternatively that even if there  are  errors  the  determination  should
   stand.  I indicated in the course of his submissions that I was satisfied
   that errors are made out along the lines of the grounds and  Mr  Devlin's
   submissions, and that the decision would require to be remade.

19) In relation to the remaking of the decision, Mr  Mullen  firstly  argued
   that there is no family life between the sponsor and the  appellant.  The
   information the appellant has provided is rather skimpy, but  it  appears
   that the sponsor left Eritrea for Saudi Arabia around 1997 to  1998,  and
   lived in Saudi Arabia for many years thereafter.  Over time, he developed
   family life with his wife and children there.  The appellant was born  on
   20 December 1995 (not 20 December 1985 as erroneously stated at paragraph
   1 of the First-tier Tribunal determination) and was only 2-3 years of age
   when the sponsor left.   From  birth  until  around  September  2011  the
   appellant was cared for by his parents in Eritrea and was not part of the
   sponsor's family unit.  It does not appear that the sponsor has lived for
   any significant period, if at all, in family with the  appellant.   There
   was then a  fairly  short  period  when  the  appellant  moved  with  the
   sponsor's wife and  their  children  to  live  in  Sudan.   There  is  no
   presumption of family life between the appellant and his brother, and  it
   was not established by the evidence.  If there is  no  family  life,  the
   case goes no further.  Even if  there  were  sufficient  family  life  to
   require consideration, there is not enough  to  show  a  disproportionate
   interference.  The appellant has refugee status in Eritrea, and there  is
   no evidence of risk of refoulement  to  Eritrea.   Any  family  life  was
   relatively brief, no more than one  year,  and  carried  on  without  any
   direct contact with the sponsor.  The  medical  evidence  fell  short  of
   showing  that  the  appellant  did  not  have  the   capacity   to   live
   independently.  The appellant's sister-in-law and the children  had  been
   granted visas and had left within a month  for  the  UK.   This  did  not
   suggest that the sponsor was living in any undue difficulty or  that  the
   rest of the family saw any problem in leaving him with a carer in  Sudan.
   If his situation had been as desperate and  he  was  as  close  a  family
   member as now portrayed, he would not have been left so  readily.   While
   Mr Mullen acknowledged  that  each  case  turns  on  its  own  facts  and
   circumstances, in Mundeba there was found not  to  be  an  obligation  to
   admit a female 15 year old orphan from DRC to join her sister in the  UK.
   The appellant was not said to be in any danger in Sudan.   There  was  no
   reason why financial support could not continue from the UK, so  that  he
   could obtain any assistance he requires from another carer if  necessary.
   There was no real description of his needs. It  was  anomalous  that  the
   payments of �100 per month were at exactly the same level  while  he  was
   living with his sister-in-law and other family  members  and  thereafter.
   The payments were said to have been for his support, but presumably  they
   were for the sponsor's wife and children while they were  in  Sudan.   It
   could be taken that after they left the full sum of �100  per  month  was
   available for his benefit and would go significantly further.  The impact
   on public funds of the appellant's arrival was likely to be considerable,
   in terms not only of accommodation and maintenance but of ongoing medical
   care.  The appellant had not established family  life,  or  alternatively
   had not produced evidence which placed an obligation on the UK to promote
   family life by permitting his entry.

Reply for appellant.

20) Mr Devlin said that it was not known what other income  the  appellant's
   relatives  had  in  Sudan  and  there  was  no  full  picture  of   their
   circumstances.  It was known from the sponsor, from the  medical  reports
   and from a supporting letter that the appellant suffers from  significant
   disability and that his carer is no longer able to look  after  him.   It
   could not properly be inferred from the continuing payments of  �100  per
   month that he was better  off  once  his  relatives  left.     Mr  Devlin
   accepted that family life was of short  duration.   However,  after  July
   2011 the appellant's situation had  changed  radically.   Until  then  he
   lived in Eritrea with his parents, while the sponsor and his family lived
   in Saudi Arabia.  Following the sponsor's expulsion from Saudi Arabia and
   the family later moving to Eritrea, there appeared to have been a further
   period when the appellant was cared  for  by  his  father.   Despite  the
   brevity of family life with the sponsor, the significant  point  is  that
   the appellant has now no mother, effectively  no  father  (as  he  is  in
   detention in Eritrea) and is connected by  way  of  family  only  to  his
   brother, sister-in-law and their children.  He became part of  that  unit
   as a disabled young man otherwise effectively orphaned and so  likely  to
   be in a state of high emotional as well as financial  dependence.   While
   the others had left the appellant behind, they had not  done  so  without
   ensuring that he had a suitable carer.  At best they had been  living  in
   Eritrea as refugees and no doubt their  conditions  there  had  not  been
   salubrious.  His sister-in-law was left with the care  of  children  aged
   11, 9, 6 and 3.  It was not surprising that the interests of the children
   in moving to the UK would be given a high  priority,  but  that  did  not
   imply that there was no family life also involving the sponsor.

21) Mr Devlin finally said that although it remained his primary  submission
   that there was sufficient evidence to allow the appeal at this stage, the
   alternative would be to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal for the
   appellant to amplify his evidence, and to covering such  matters  as  the
   extent of his disability and his likely care costs, if any.

Discussion and conclusions.

22) I reserved my determination.

23) As indicated above, I explained in the course of submissions that I  was
   satisfied that error was shown on all 3 grounds  and  that  the  decision
   requires to be remade.  The  errors  emerge  sufficiently  from  what  is
   related above.  They are fundamental to the  outcome  and  it  could  not
   properly be supported, as Mr Mullen effectively sought, by other  reasons
   altogether.

24) I deal firstly with the last matter raised by Mr Devlin.   While  it  is
   for the respondent to justify any interference with Article 8 rights,  it
   is for an applicant to put before the respondent  all  the  circumstances
   relevant to his family and private life to show that  any  obligation  on
   the respondent arises, and what the extent of any interference might  be.
   The appellant should have  ensured  that  all  relevant  information  was
   before the Entry Clearance Officer.  He  has  had  ample  opportunity  to
   bring further evidence since then.  The Upper Tribunal's Procedure  Rules
   and Practice Directions require the earliest  possible  notice  where  an
   appellant asks for further evidence to  be  considered.   The  suggestion
   that the appellant might improve his case comes much  too  late.   It  is
   appropriate to decide the case on the evidence available.

25) No doubt the appellant has always been  regarded  as  a  member  of  the
   sponsor's family in the broad sense, but  he  is  not  a  member  of  the
   primary family unit of the  nature  which  is  presumed  to  qualify  for
   consideration under Article 8.   The  facts  that  the  appellant  has  a
   disability (leading to some higher than normal degree  of  dependence  on
   others) and (so far as is known) no other remaining or  accessible  close
   relatives are in favour of extending family life for Article  8  purposes
   to the relationship between an adult and a minor sibling.   Against  that
   are the facts that  the  appellant  is  almost  adult,  suffers  from  no
   intellectual rather than physical disability, has never lived as a family
   member of the sponsor, and has had very little if any direct contact with
   him since infancy.

26) I find the case on the borderline as to whether  family  life  is  shown
   for Article 8 purposes, and proceed on  the  basis  that  there  is  just
   enough to require further assessment of the merits.

27) The relatively slender basis for finding family life  to  exist  is  one
   factor against the appellant's case.

28)  Mundeba says that  family  considerations  include  evaluation  of  the
   child's welfare and unmet needs, leading to an assessment of whether  the
   combined circumstances are sufficiently serious and compelling to require
   admission.  However, the cogency of the case for a  state  obligation  to
   enable family life to be developed by admitting an applicant must be much
   less where childhood has almost run its course.  The circumstances relied
   upon to make this a compelling case have  very  little  to  do  with  the
   appellant being a child.  He has not spent his childhood so far with  the
   sponsor and has only a short period of childhood  left.   His  particular
   needs are not as a child but as a person of poor health, needs which  are
   likely to increase not  decrease  as  he  leaves  childhood  behind  him.
   Although Mr Devlin did what he could  to  shift  the  emphasis,  that  is
   trying to have it both ways.

29) Although the medical issue is only part of the  overall  proportionality
   assessment, and so not subject to the full stringency of N v  UK,  it  is
   the major plank.  The appellant's best interest issue is essentially  his
   health and not his youth.  He would have no case worth arguing if he were
   either (a) his present age and entirely healthy or  (b)  of  the  age  of
   majority and disabled.

30) The UK is entitled to make rules about the class of dependent  relatives
   who  will  be  admitted,  and  to  apply  accommodation  and  maintenance
   requirements.   It  is  a  further  relevant   consideration   that   the
   appellant's medical condition is likely to be  a  significant  burden  on
   public funds.




31)  This  case  does  not  disclose  such  interference  with  family  life
   interests that the  UK  state  is  obliged  to  promote  family  life  by
   admitting the appellant, irrespective of the requirements of the rules.

32) The determination of the First-tier Tribunal is set aside, but  for  all
   the above reasons the decision substituted is that the  appeal  is  again
   dismissed.

33) No order for anonymity has been requested or made.
