Solicitors

                            DECISION AND REASONS

FRAMEWORK OF APPEAL

 1. The Respondents are a family unit constituted by the  mother  (aged  26
    years) and two sons (aged 11 and 7 years),  all  nationals  of  Zambia.
    This appeal has its origins in a decision dated 16 September 2013  made
    on behalf of the Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  (the
    "Secretary  of  State"),  the  Appellants,  refusing  the  Respondents'
    application for leave to remain in the United Kingdom under  Article  8
    ECHR.

 2. The Appellant's decisions were challenged by appeal to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (the "FtT") which, by its decision promulgated on 25  February
    2015, allowed the  appeals.   The  Tribunal's  omnibus  conclusion  was
    framed in the following terms:
         "For the reasons I have given, I find that  the  decisions  of  the
         Respondent were not in accordance with the  law  and  the  relevant
         immigration rules and legislation."

    This is followed by a passage embodying the twofold conclusion that the
    decisions in respect of the two children were not  in  accordance  with
    the law, while the appeals of all three family members succeeded  under
    the Immigration Rules.

 3. The decision duly analysed, we consider that the FtT made the following
    key findings and conclusions:
    (a)  The Appellant erred in law by determining the applications on  the
         basis of the pre-July 2012 provisions of Appendix FM and  paragraph
         276 ADE of the Rules.
    (b)  In the mother's case, the suitability requirements of paragraph S-
         LTR of Appendix 1 were satisfied.
    (c)   Ditto  the  requirements  of  paragraph  E-LTRET2.2,  subject  to
         paragraph EX.1.
    (d)  Applying paragraph EX.1 and  paragraph  276  ADE  (1)(iv)  of  the
         Rules,  in  tandem  with  section  117B(6)  of   the   Nationality,
         Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act"), it would  not  be
         reasonable to expect either child to leave the United Kingdom.
    (e)  The Judge followed this by the statement:
             "In the circumstances, it has not been  necessary  for  me  to
             consider  Article  8  based  upon  wider   considerations   of
             proportionality,   or    with    reference    to    Strasbourg
             jurisprudence, which wider considerations  essentially  become
             otiose."
    (f)  The Judge then purported to address "the issue of  lawfulness"  of
         the decisions in the two childrens' cases, proceeding  to  conclude
         that the decisions were unlawful since, contrary to paragraphs 51.3
         and  51.4  of  the  Appellant's   "Enforcement   Instructions   and
         Guidance", the two children  were  wrongly  served  with  completed
         Forms IS151A (Part 2) generating an out  of  country  appeal  only,
         whereas they should have been served with Forms IS151B which  would
         have stimulated an in country appeal.

 4. In a considered grant of permission to  appeal,  Upper  Tribunal  Judge
    Smith reasoned that the FtT had arguably erred in law in the  following
    respects:
    (i)  By measuring the children's periods of  residence  in  the  United
         Kingdom by reference to the date of the hearing,  rather  than  the
         date of the Secretary of State's decision.
    (ii) In holding that the seven  year  residence  periods  specified  in
         paragraph 276  ADE(1)(iv)  of  the  Rules  and  paragraph  EX.1  of
         Appendix FM to the Rules was satisfied by reference to the date  of
         the hearing rather  than  the  date  of  the  applications  to  the
         Secretary of State.
    (iii)    By failing to consider the Article 8 claims of the Respondents
         outwith the framework of the Rules.

 5. Two observations about the grant of permission to appeal are  apposite.
    The first, bearing in mind  that  this  is  the  Secretary  of  State's
    appeal, is that the third of the issues of law summarised above did not
    form part of the grounds of appeal, albeit the Judge  was  entitled  to
    identify this issue provided that her action accorded with the decision
    in Robinson - v - Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home  Department  and
    Immigration Appeal Tribunal [1997] Imm Ar 568.  The second is that  the
    grant of permission is silent on the  "appealable  decision"  issue  to
    which we have referred in our synopsis of the  FtT's  decision  in  [3]
    above.  I consider that this omission is  attributable  to  the  highly
    unsatisfactory manner in  which  the  Secretary  of  State's  completed
    application for permission, in Form  IAUT-1,  was  formulated:  see  in
    particular Section F, the intervening page, section C and, on the  next
    page, the final substantive paragraph of the completed  form  beginning
    with the words "Ground 2".

FACTUAL MATRIX

 6. The salient facts invite the following summary:
      a) During most of the period 2003 - July 2006, the mother was lawfully
         present in the United Kingdom.
      b) Since 04 July 2006 the status  of  the  mother  has  been  that  of
         unlawful overstayer.
      c) The older son was born in 2004 and is now aged 11 years.
      d) The younger son was born in January 2008 and is now aged  almost  8
         years.
      e) In July 2010 the  Respondents'  leave  to  remain  application  was
         refused by the Secretary of State.
      f) In August 2011 removal notices were served.
      g) The two children have been  reared  by  their  mother  without  any
         assistance from their father, also a Zambian national, from  around
         2010.
      h) Mother and father were divorced in January 2015.
      i) In  October  2011  the  mother  withdrew  her  appeal  against  the
         Secretary of State's July 2010 decision.
      j) This was followed by the application generating  the  Secretary  of
         State's further decision dated 16 September 2013 (supra).

CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSIONS

 7. We have reached a fairly clear conclusion in this case.  The kernel  of
    the application for permission to  appeal  and  the  ensuing  grant  of
    appeal resolves to the question of whether the FtT applied the  correct
    date in allowing the Appellants' appeals.  By virtue of  paragraph  276
    ADE(1) in force at the time the operative date  was  the  date  of  the
    application made.  In short the requirement enshrined in the rules  had
    to be satisfied on that date.  In equally brief terms the FtT erred  in
    law by applying the date of the hearing as the  operative  date  rather
    than the date of the application. That  was  a  fundamental  error  and
    while we note the submission that the error was not  material  and  the
    judge would have inevitably reached the same conclusion by a  different
    route, we prefer to approach the matter in the following way given that
    this was an egregious error of law.

 8. In our judgment the correct course is to accede  to  the  Secretary  of
    State's appeal and to set aside the decision of the FtT on  the  ground
    which I have outlined.  That requires the decision of  the  FtT  to  be
    remade.  The remaking will take place in this forum  having  regard  to
    the Upper Tribunal Practice Directions  and  given  that  there  is  no
    sensible reason for delaying the final outcome by remittal to the FtT.

 9. The alternative route for the Appellants at the time  of  FtT  decision
    and taking into account the absence of any  fresh  application  to  the
    Secretary of State, also as  of  today  before  this  Tribunal,  is  to
    succeed outside the Rules.  This requires a consideration of all of the
    facts and factors highlighted in the determination of the  FtT  and  in
    particular the unchallenged findings which are contained therein.

10. By virtue of the Rules in tandem with the relevant provisions  of  Part
    5A of the 2002 Act and in particular Section 117B (6)(b)  the  question
    which arises as of today for the this Tribunal is whether it  would  be
    reasonable to expect the two children in question to leave  the  United
    Kingdom.  It is common case  that  as  of  today  they  are  qualifying
    children under the r�gime of Part 5a of the 2002 Act.  Having regard to
    the factual matrix and the  extant  findings  we,  without  hesitation,
    apply those provisions of the Act, which are a mirror image of what  is
    contained in the Rules, in the Appellants favour. In short  we  re-make
    the decision of the FtT by allowing the appeals on a different basis.

DECISION

11. Accordingly, the  Appellants  succeed  via  the  route  which  we  have
    outlined.
