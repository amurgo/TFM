For the Appellant:     Mr D Coleman, Direct Access
For the Respondent:    Mr E Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a citizen of Ghana born on  7th  August  1975  and  he
    entered the United Kingdom in 2010 as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.   His
    leave was subsequently extended and on 11th January 2013  he  submitted
    an application for further leave to remain which was granted, extending
    his leave to 25th February 2015.

 2. On 16th January 2015 he made an application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain as a Tier 1 (General) Migrant.  That application was refused  by
    the Secretary of State on the basis that checks had been undertaken and
    his claimed and declared earnings on a previous  application  were  not
    consistent between the Home Office and the  HMRC.   On  review  of  his
    previous application dated 11th January 2013,  he  had  stated  to  the
    Secretary of State that he had previous earnings  as  the  director  of
    Abse Personnel Limited of �73,526 gross and �54,000 net in  the  period
    of 1st December 2011 to  28th  November  2012.   In  support  of  that
    application he submitted pay slips  and  bank  statements.   His  total
    earnings of �73,526 gave him 45 points for total earnings.

 3. On his application for indefinite leave  to  remain  the  Secretary  of
    State had consulted HMRC and data confirmed for  the  tax  year  ending
    April 2012, that his income from all sources  was  �16,545.   This  was
    from the Borough of Tower Hamlets, Central Watch Security and  a  self-
    assessment return for Abse Personnel Limited.  HMRC data also confirmed
    for the tax year ending April 2013 that his income from all sources was
    �19,212.  This included earnings from the Borough of Tower Hamlets  and
    Guardian Selection  Limited  and  a  self-assessment  return  for  Abse
    Personnel Limited and John Cass School.  As such  his  HMRC  record  of
    income was classified as not consistent with  his  income  and  it  was
    deduced that he had used deception on a previous application for  leave
    to remain and his application fell for refusal under  paragraph  322(2)
    of the  Immigration  Rules.   He  therefore  was  refused  leave  under
    paragraph  245CD(b)  as  he  did  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules on general grounds.

 4. The  appellant  appealed  that  decision  on  21st  December  2015  and
    initially  it  was  classified  as  being  out  of  time.   On  further
    representations by the appellant who was acting in person he was served
    with a notice of in time appeal on 4th March 2016.   On  12th  December
    2016 the appellant once again in person  made  an  application  for  an
    expedited hearing.  That was refused by the First-tier Tribunal on  7th
    November 2016.  The appellant continued to have no representative.   On
    27th January 2017 a notice was sent by the Tribunal to  him,  following
    his request to expedite the  appeal  hearing  and  the  expedition  was
    granted.  On 6th February a notice of hearing was sent to the appellant
    in person with directions to the appellant to supply witness statements
    and a bundle of all documents to  be  relied  on,  in  the  hearing  on
    27th April 2017.  This was to arrive at least  5  days  prior  to  the
    hearing.  Nothing was received by the Tribunal.

 5. The matter came before First-tier Tribunal Judge Andonian on 27th April
    2017 and the appellant appeared in person and requested an adjournment.
     As recorded in the decision of Judge Andonian at paragraph [1]

         "He said he had been unable to obtain representation by a solicitor
         because that solicitor had been booked on two  cases  on  the  same
         day.  When I asked him whether that solicitor was  booked  to  hear
         those cases at Taylor House or elsewhere, he said he did  not  know
         but that only was told that the solicitor had two cases  booked  on
         the same day and could not take on his case".

 6. The judge also recorded at paragraphs [2] and [3]

          "the appellant  had  received  the  notice  of  refusal  on  17th
          November 2015 and had had plenty of time to instruct  solicitors.
          He did not do so.  He filed grounds of appeal without instructing
          solicitors, and his evidence was that shortly before the  hearing
          date fixed at this Tribunal, he spoke to some  solicitors  asking
          them to represent him but he was advised that the  solicitor  had
          two cases to contend with and could not represent him.

          In the above circumstances, I told the appellant  that  since  he
          had plenty of opportunity to instruct solicitors  and  an  expert
          accountant to deal with the allegations that were raised  in  the
          refusal letter and he had not done so, the appeal would  proceed"
          [3].




Application for Permission to Appeal

 7. The  grounds  asserted  that  at  the  outset  the  appellant  made  an
    application for appeal and he had been let down by his solicitor and he
    was entirely blameless.  He  found  himself  unrepresented  through  no
    fault of his own and the judge had overlooked  the  fact  that  he  had
    already spoken to his solicitor prior to  the  hearing  who  failed  to
    appear on his behalf because of other "irreversible commitments on  the
    same day".  The appellant relied  on  Nwaigwe  (adjournment:  fairness)
    [2014] UKUT 00418 (IAC)  and it was considered that the  appellant  had
    not had a fair hearing.  The test  to  be  applied  was  fairness.   He
    submitted that his case was not straightforward and the respondent  had
    made allegations of deception  and  it  was  essentially  that  he  was
    properly represented.

 8. Further the appellant submitted  that  there  was  a  mistake  of  fact
    because it was impossible to know from the pay slips whether taxes  had
    been deducted from the gross income and his bank statements only showed
    net income.  He had absolute confidence that all taxes had been paid to
    the HMRC.  He had contacted the accountants to  rectify  the  HMRC  any
    discrepancy and mentioned  this  to  the  judge.   His  accountant  was
    currently looking into how his tax liabilities owed to the  HMRC  could
    be settled.  This was not a mandatory refusal but a discretionary  one.
    The appellant had followed the  guidance  and  had  no  idea  that  his
    previous accountant had failed or neglected to file the appropriate tax
    with HMRC.

 9. Permission to appeal was granted by First-tier Tribunal Judge  Osborne.
    It was said to be arguable that the judge erred in failing  to  provide
    the appellant an opportunity to instruct solicitors and accountants  to
    represent him at the final hearing.

The Hearing

10. At the hearing before me, Mr Coleman relied on the grounds of appeal in
    writing which he assisted in drafting.  He emphasised  the  point  that
    the appellant said that he had instructed solicitors  one  week  before
    the hearing and was told that the  solicitors  would  not  be  able  to
    attend.  He was told to attend and get an  adjournment.   The  question
    was whether it was fair  or  not.   The  appellant  was  refused  under
    paragraph  322(2)  and  this  was  a  discretionary  refusal.   It  was
    submitted that there could have been a difference to the  outcome  with
    representation.

11. Mr Tufan submitted  the  appellant  had  plenty  of  time  to  instruct
    solicitors and there was no evidence  at  all  that  he  did  so.   The
    hearing must be dealt with fairly and that included a fairness  to  the
    respondent and with  a  consideration  of  the  public  funds  and  the
    thousands of pounds expended on hearings.  It was clear the  judge  was
    not satisfied there should be an adjournment.

Conclusions

12. Nwaigwe confirms that the essential test  in  relation  to  matters  of
    adjournment is fairness.  The headnote emphasises


    'If a Tribunal refuses  to  accede  to  an  adjournment  request,  such
    decision could, in principle, be erroneous in law in several  respects:
    these  include  a  failure  to   take   into   account   all   material
    considerations;  permitting  immaterial  considerations   to   intrude;
    denying the party concerned  a  fair  hearing;  failing  to  apply  the
    correct test; and acting irrationally.  In practice, in most cases  the
    question will be whether the refusal deprived the affected party of his
    right to a fair hearing.  Where an adjournment refusal is challenged on
    fairness grounds, it is important to recognise that  the  question  for
    the Upper Tribunal is not whether the FtT  acted  reasonably.   Rather,
    the test to be applied is that of fairness:  was there any  deprivation
    of the affected party's right to a fair hearing? See SH (Afghanistan) v
    Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] EWCA Civ 1284.

13. The overriding objective, however, also sets out as follows  principles
    which assist in deciding on the matter of fairness

    Overriding objective and parties' obligation  to  co-operate  with  the
    Tribunal

    2.-    (1)   The overriding objective of these Rules is to  enable  the
             Tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.

         (2)      Dealing with a case fairly and justly includes-

             (a) dealing with the case in ways which are  proportionate  to
                  the importance of the case, the complexity of the  issues,
                  the anticipated costs and the resources of the parties and
                  of the Tribunal;

             (b) avoiding unnecessary formality and seeking flexibility  in
                  the proceedings;

             (c) ensuring, so far as practicable, that the parties are able
                  to participate fully in the proceedings;

             (d) using any special expertise of the  Tribunal  effectively;
                  and

             (e)  avoiding  delay,  so  far  as  compatible   with   proper
                  consideration of the issues.

         (3)      The Tribunal must seek to give effect  to  the  overriding
             objective when it-

             (a) exercises any power under these Rules; or

             (b) interprets any rule or practice direction.

         (4)      Parties must-

             (a) help the Tribunal to further the overriding objective; and

             (b) co-operate with the Tribunal generally.



14. I have outlined the history of this matter and clearly  indicated  that
    the original decision was taken on 17th November  2015  and  throughout
    that period until one week before the hearing the  appellant  chose  to
    represent himself despite a direction from the Tribunal  prior  to  the
    hearing date,  which  the  appellant  clearly  received,  that  he  was
    directed to submit any evidence to the  Tribunal  at  least  five  days
    prior to the hearing.  Absolutely no  evidence  was  submitted  by  the
    appellant.  On attendance at the hearing he told the judge that he  had
    instructed a solicitor.  The solicitor could not take on two  cases  in
    the same day.  The judge at paragraph 12 stated

         "The appellant had sufficient time to instruct solicitors since the
         refusal of his application for ILR on 17th November 2015 and he had
         not dealt with it.  He had asked for an adjournment at the  hearing
         of this appeal which was not a good reason to accede to.   I  found
         the appellant not to be credible".

    That was open to the judge but however was the conclusion at the  close
    of the decision.

15. The key paragraph is at paragraph [3] of Judge Andonian's decision.

           'In the above circumstances, I told the appellant that since  he
           had had plenty of opportunity  to  instruct  solicitors  and  an
           expert accountant to deal with the allegations that were  raised
           in the refusal letter, and he had not done so, the appeal  would
           proceed'.

16. What is critical is the appellant had produced absolutely  no  evidence
    whatsoever that he had instructed a solicitor.  He did not produce  any
    evidence that he  instructed  an  accountant.   Further  as  the  judge
    recorded at paragraph [8] when he asked the appellant the name  of  the
    accountants, he said he did not know the name of the accountants as  he
    only knew someone from that firm who had now gone away and he could not
    find him.  He said he had tried to telephone him  and  this  individual
    did not respond.   He  did  not  know  where  the  office  was  as  the
    accountant did not give him details.  The judge did  not  find  any  of
    that credible and stated "here is an appellant  who  has  instructed  a
    firm of accountants to deal with his accounts and yet he did  not  know
    who these were, did not know their whereabouts and  yet  said  that  he
    trusted his accountants when the accountants filed his returns".

17. The appellant also confirmed that he had not checked any of the figures
    before the tax returns were submitted  and  yet  he  said  he  had  not
    checked any of the figures as he trusted his accountants and yet he did
    not know where they were.  He had no details of these accountants,  and
    the judge found "that simply did not make sense and was not  credible",
    paragraph 8.   In  the  overall  scheme  of  matters  that  too  was  a
    conclusion open to the judge.

18. At paragraph 10 the judge recorded  that  the  appellant  said  he  had
    instructed another firm of accountants but he could not tell the  judge
    when they were instructed, merely that they were T  H  L  and  Co.   He
    could not tell the judge when he asked him whether he had given written
    instructions to these accountants to deal with his matter after he  was
    refused leave to remain and he said he had not done  so  but  had  only
    recently done so for the hearing of his appeal.

19. As recorded in the First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision at paragraph  8



    8.     The appellant said before me that he did  have  accountants  but
         did not know where they were, he said he provided  his  accountants
         with all the details  and  he  trusted  them.   When  I  asked  the
         appellant, what was the name of the accountants, he said he did not
         know the name of the accountants as he only knew someone from  that
         firm who had now gone away and he could not find him.  He  said  he
         had tried to telephone him and this individual did not respond.   I
         asked whether he had gone to his office and he said he did not know
         where the office was as this accountant did not give him details of
         the office.  I did not find any of this credible whatsoever.   Here
         is an appellant who had instructed a firm of  accountants  to  deal
         with his accounts and yet he did not know who these were,  did  not
         know their whereabouts and yet said that he trusted his accountants
         when the accountants filed his returns.  I asked him whether he had
         checked the figures before the tax returns were submitted,  and  he
         said he had not checked any  of  the  figures  as  he  trusted  his
         accountants and yet he did not know where they were, he had no name
         to give me, and he had  no  details  of  these  accountants.   That
         simply did not make sense and was not credible.

    9.     HMRC data also confirmed for the tax year ending April 2013  the
         appellant's income from all sources was  �19212.00.  This  included
         earnings from 2 employers, Borough of Tower  Hamlets  and  Guardian
         Selection Ltd and a self-assessment return for Abse  personnel  Ltd
         and John Cass School.  HMRC data confirmed for the tax year  ending
         April 2014 the appellants' income from all sources  was  �18611.35.
         this included 2 employers, Borough  of  Tower  Hamlets  and  London
         Borough of Newnham.  HMRC data confirmed for the  tax  year  ending
         April 2015 the appellant's income from all sources  was  �34592.22.
         This included earnings from 1 employer, London Borough of Newnham.

    10.    As the appellants HMRC records of  income  were  not  consistent
         with the income he declared to the Home Office,  it  is  considered
         that he had used deception when submitting his  application.   This
         is  because  he  had  claimed  points  for  earnings   from   Self-
         employment/directorships which were not accurate as per the  income
         he declared to HMRC and where therefore deemed  to  be  fabricated.
         The appellant said he had instructed  another  accountant  to  deal
         with the matter.  When I asked who these accountants were, he  said
         that they were T.H.L and Co., chartered certified accountants.   He
         said they had been instructed to deal with the accounts and I asked
         him when they were instructed and he could not tell  me  when  this
         was to deal with the matters raised by the respondent  in  relation
         to the various discrepancies.  I asked him  whether  he  had  given
         written instructions to these accountants to deal with his  matter,
         after he was refused leave to remain and he said he had not done so
         but had only recently done  so  for  the  hearing  of  his  appeal.
         Looking at the grounds of appeal that the appellant filed they  are
         not relevant to the various allegations made against him in so  far
         as they do not deal with and thus answer  those  allegations.   The
         thrust of the appellant's case was that it  was  a  breach  of  his
         human rights not to be granted ILR and that the  respondent  should
         have used her discretion to grant him such leave to remain and that
         not to do so was a breach of Section 6  of  the   Human  Right  Act
         1998'.

20. Critically as  the  judge  stated,  the  grounds  of  appeal  that  the
    appellant filed were not  relevant  to  the  various  allegations  made
    against  him  insofar  as  they  did  not  deal  with  or  answer   the
    allegations. It is correct that there must be some time  limit  on  the
    ability of the appellant to produce evidence, expert or  otherwise,  to
    support the bare assertions made by the appellant.  Indeed,  the  judge
    found  no  credible  explanation  in  all  the  circumstances  for  the
    discrepancies and clearly as can be seen from the  judge's  conclusions
    at the close of his decision that he kept in mind the possible need for
    an adjournment until the close of the proceedings.

21. The application by the appellant for permission to appeal sets out that



         "It was impossible to know from the pay  slips  whether  taxes  had
         been deducted from the gross income, my pay  slips  clearly  showed
         that deductions had been made from my  gross  income  and  my  bank
         statements only showed the net  income  that  appeared  on  my  pay
         slips.  Thus prior to this HMRC discrepancy being flagged up I  had
         absolute confidence that all taxes had been paid  to  HMRC  without
         any doubt".

22. The fact is however that the gross income declared for  the  tax  years
    were recorded and compared by the Secretary of State but even  the  net
    income as declared by the appellant for his tax period (straddling  two
    years) did not equate with the gross income declared for the equivalent
    two years tax to the HMRC.

23. The First-tier Tribunal Judge dismissed the appellant's appeal  because
    the judge found there were

         "Serious discrepancies between the appellant's stated income as set
         out in  his  application  and  the  information  before  HMRC.   No
         credible explanation was given to  me  about  those  discrepancies.
         The grounds of appeal do not deal with them.  The appellant was not
         able to deal with them: he said he had instructed  accountants  but
         in fact no accountants had been instructed to deal with them".

24. The criticism made by the Secretary of State was that it was the  gross
    amount that was adrift.  It was not disputed  that  the  appellant  had
    produced payslips and bank statements to the Secretary of State in  the
    previous  application.   It  was  his  representations  on  his   gross
    declarations which were challenged. The appellant must have been  aware
    of his own tax affairs which included self assessment.

25. The critical point, however, is that the appellant produced  absolutely
    no evidence of instructing a solicitor, of instructing an accountant or
    of any evidence in relation to his appeal prior to  the  hearing  date.
    In the light of the overriding objective the appellant had  been  given
    ample  time  to  instruct  a  solicitor  on  matters  which  were   not
    complicated, particularly as he has  responsibility  for  his  own  tax
    affairs.  It is notable that the appellant accepted in his  grounds  of
    appeal that there was a discrepancy in his tax affairs.   As  Mr  Tufan
    pointed out the cost to the public purse of unnecessary adjournments is
    substantial, is contrary to the efficient conduct of court  proceedings
    and in these particular circumstances  fairness  was  accorded  to  the
    appellant.  The only point at which a solicitor was instructed was when
    the appellant lost his appeal.  At no point did the  appellant  produce
    any evidence that he had instructed either a solicitor or an accountant
    prior to the First-tier Tribunal hearing. The judge in essence  applied
    the principle of fairness and in the light of all the circumstances and
    the evidence before him, the judge showed no unfairness in his approach
    to the consideration of the adjournment and the decision  shall  stand.



Notice of Decision

I find no material error of law  in  the  decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal
Judge Andonian and the decision will stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
