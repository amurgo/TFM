                            DECISION AND REASONS


     1. On 18 August 2017 Dr H H Storey, Judge of the Upper Tribunal, found
        a decision of First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Juss,  promulgated  on  6
        August  2015  dismissing  the  appellant's   appeal   against   the
        respondent's decision of 17 December 2014 refusing the  application
        to remain  on  the  basis  of  private  and  family  life  and  his
        relationship with his spouse a British  citizen,  was  infected  by
        legal error such that the same was to be set aside.  The  reasoning
        is set out at [5] of the error of  law  finding  in  the  following
        terms:


         5.  Having considered the rival submissions and perused  the  case
                    file, I am persuaded that the FtT Judge materially erred
                    in law. The problem with his decision is not  just  that
                    he  failed  to  address  the  appellants   circumstances
                    outside the Rules expressly. He also failed to carry out
                    a  structured  approach.  Had  he  done  so,  the  first
                    important matter he would have had to assess was whether
                    the appellant enjoyed a family  life  relationship  with
                    his mother in law, in order  to  establish  whether  the
                    contents of his Article 8(1) rights comprise more than a
                    private life relationship with her. Mr Mills is  correct
                    to say that the Judge found  that  care  and  assistance
                    being provided by the appellant to his mother in law was
                    laudable, it was not indispensable to her well-being  as
                    there were two other daughters living in her  household.
                    However, whether or not  his  care  and  assistance  was
                    indispensable, it was the evidence of the appellant  and
                    his wife (which the Judge did not appear to reject) that
                    the appellant's wife's three other sisters were not able
                    to afford the time away from their own work  and  family
                    duties to give their mother the necessary care  and  the
                    appellant and his wife had recently  shifted  their  own
                    home in Coventry to go and live with his  wife's  mother
                    in Nottingham  as  the  latter  had  had  an  operation.
                    Previously the appellant had been  going  to  Nottingham
                    two or three times a week in order to provide  her  with
                    such assistance. The unchallenged evidence was that  the
                    appellant's wife also  provided  some  support  for  the
                    mother-in-law   financially.   Given   that   evidential
                    backdrop, the Judge, if  he  had  properly  address  the
                    matter of whether there  were  compelling  circumstances
                    outside the Rules, may well have decided to  begin  with
                    that there was a family life  relationship  between  the
                    appellant and mother-in-law  which  went  beyond  normal
                    emotional ties. That in turn may have affected  how  the
                    Judge viewed the issue of whether there were  compelling
                    circumstances.


     2. At [8 -9] Judge Story wrote:


                    8. Bearing in mind the foregoing considerations I cannot
                    agree with Mr Mills that the failure of the FtT Judge to
                    specifically conduct  a  fact  sensitive  assessment  of
                    whether the appellants circumstances warranted  a  grant
                    of leave outside the Rules on the  basis  of  compelling
                    circumstances  was  an  immaterial  error.  The  Judge's
                    failings did in my  judgement  involve  material  errors
                    necessitating that I set aside his  decision.  The  fact
                    that I have been in part  persuaded  of  such  error  in
                    light of the Supreme  Court  decision  reached  a  month
                    after I heard the case, when but for a complex mix-up of
                    files I would have  determined  the  case  before  then,
                    might be said to be fortunate for the appellant; but  on
                    the other hand, the Supreme Court declares what the  law
                    should always have been understood to be.  I  note  that
                    another matter which Lady Hale and Lord Carnwath saw  of
                    possible relevance in any proportionality assessment  in
                    spouse cases was the fact that the couple married before
                    the introduction of the new Rules: see [104].


                    9. Pursuing the same logic that led me to find  material
                    error of law, I do not consider I am not in  a  position
                    to decide this case at this stage. There is a need for a
                    further hearing  at  which  the  Tribunal  will  require
                    considerably   more   help    from    the    appellant's
                    representatives as regards the full details of  the  job
                    offered to the appellant (so as to assess its  efficacy)
                    and the precise duration and extent of  the  appellant's
                    wife's financial assistance to the  mother-in-law.  Also
                    relevant will be evidence as  to  whether  the  couple's
                    move to Nottingham to live with the mother-in-law proved
                    temporary.  Whilst  I  draw  short  of  making  specific
                    directions, it should be clear from the  foregoing  what
                    further evidence the appellant's representatives need to
                    adduce in accordance with Tribunal directions.


     3. The matter was listed before me following the making of a  judicial
        transfer order for the purposes of a Resumed  hearing  after  which
        the Upper Tribunal will make a decision to either allow or  dismiss
        the appellant's appeal



Background


     4. The respondent states the appellant entered the United Kingdom on 9
        May 2010 with entry clearance as a visitor valid from 26 April 2010
        to 26 October 2010. On 18 November 2010, the appellant applied  for
        a Certificate  of  Approval  (CAO  -marriage)  in  order  to  marry
        Rajvinder Kaur  Gurcha,  a  British  citizen.  On  5  January  2011
        approval was given which on 5 April 2011 reached expiry. On 22 July
        2011, the appellant submitted an  application  under  Human  Rights
        Article 8 which was refused on 2 September 2011 with  no  right  of
        appeal. On 23 April 2012, the appellant  requested  reconsideration
        under Human Rights Article 8.  On 26 November 2014,  the  appellant
        was issued  with  an  IS.75  and  IS.76  form,  providing  him  the
        opportunity  to  submit  further  reasons/documentary  evidence  in
        relation to his Human  Rights  claim.  On  10  December  2014,  the
        appellant submitted further documentary evidence in support of  his
        claim for  Human  Rights  Article  8.  On  17  December  2014,  the
        appellant was  served  with  an  IS.151A  notice  of  liability  to
        detention and removal.
     5. In the refusal of 17 December 2014,  the  respondent  accepted  the
        appellant met the Suitability  requirements  of  Appendix  FM.  The
        respondent also  accepted  the  appellant  had  married  a  British
        national who satisfied the definition of a  partner  found  in  Gen
        1.2(i) of Appendix FM.
     6. The respondent accepted the appellant could satisfy the Eligibility
        requirements with reference to E-LTRP.1.2 as he is the spouse of  a
        British citizen and that the appellant  and  his  spouse  had  been
        living together for at least two years prior to  the  date  of  the
        application, meeting the eligibility requirement as a partner under
        E- LTRP.1.7.
     7. The respondent did not accept  that  the  appellant  had  submitted
        evidence to show that he has any dependent children under  the  age
        of  18  in  the  United  Kingdom  and  so  could  not  satisfy  the
        eligibility requirements to be considered on the  basis  of  family
        life as a parent.
     8.  The  decision  maker  thereafter  considered  the  merits  of  the
        application by reference to EX.1 of  Appendix  FM.   It  was  found
        there  were  no  dependent  children  declared  in  the  appellants
        submissions and, by reference to EX.1 (b), that  no  insurmountable
        obstacles had been presented that would prevent the appellant  from
        returning to India and continuing with his family life outside  the
        United Kingdom. The decision-maker  found  there  was  no  evidence
        submitted to show that it  would  be  unreasonable  to  expect  the
        appellant and his spouse to re-establish their family life in India
        as the decision-maker was unaware of difficulties in establishing a
        family life there which could not be overcome.  The  decision-maker
        concluded that so far as the spouse's circumstances were concerned,
        a degree of inconvenience and economic hardship was not found to be
        enough to qualify as an  insurmountable  obstacle  to  family  life
        continuing outside the United Kingdom.
     9. At [25 - 26] of the reasons for refusal letter  the  decision-maker
        writes:




                  25. Therefore, as your client does not have family in  the
                  United Kingdom within the definition  of  the  Immigration
                  Rules,  your  client  cannot  therefore  claim   to   have
                  established a family in  the  United  Kingdom  within  the
                  meaning of Article 8. Consequently, it is considered  that
                  your client does  not  qualify  under  Section  EX.1,  and
                  therefore under Section D-LTRP.1.1-1.2 and D-LTRPT.1.1-1.2
                  of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.


                  26. Consequently, your  clients  claim  is  refused  under
                  Section D-LTRP.1.3 and D-LTRP.1.3 of Appendix  FM  of  the
                  Immigration Rules and it is considered that  your  clients
                  removal is proportionate in pursuit of  a  legitimate  aim
                  and Article 8(2) of the ECHR.


    10. The decision-maker consider the matter thereafter by  reference  to
        Paragraph 276 ADE of  the  Rules  in  relation  to  the  appellants
        private life  but  concluded  the  appellant  could  not  meet  the
        requirements for leave to remain under  these  provisions  for  the
        reasons set out at [28 and 29] of the reasons for  refusal  letter.
        At [29] it was stated the  appellant  failed  to  provide  evidence
        demonstrating there would be  very  significant  obstacles  to  the
        appellants reintegration into India if required to leave the United
        Kingdom.
    11. The decision-maker considered  the  matter  outside  the  Rules  by
        reference to whether exceptional circumstances existed which  might
        warrant consideration of a grant of leave to remain on that  basis.
        It was concluded that it was not appropriate to grant leave on this
        basis  especially  as  the  appellant  had  failed  to  demonstrate
        insurmountable  obstacles  to  the  family  life  enjoyed  by   the
        appellant with his spouse continuing abroad and that in relation to
        his private life he failed to  establish  that  his  removal  would
        result in a disproportionate interference with the same.
    12.  The  decision-maker  referred  to  the  option  of  the  appellant
        returning to India with his spouse remain  in  the  United  Kingdom
        whilst he made an application to re-enter lawfully and to the  fact
        the appellant had failed to provide reasons as to  why  this  could
        not occur.
    13. Notwithstanding the clear  indication  given  by  Judge  Storey  in
        relation to the type of evidence  that  the  Upper  Tribunal  would
        expect to see on the next occasion, the only skeleton  argument  in
        the papers at the commencement of the hearing  was  that  dated  19
        July 2015 and the most up-to-date witness statement was that  dated
        8  May  2015.  In  light  of  the  reasons  the  matter  was  being
        reconsidered this is a wholly unsatisfactory state of  affairs.  Mr
        Ahmed indicated the appellant had attended to  give  oral  evidence
        but failing to provide an up-to-date witness statement.  This would
        have meant the respondent's representative having no notice of what
        the appellant was to say until  he  gave  his  evidence  in  chief.
        Accordingly, the appellant was directed to  prepare  a  handwritten
        witness statement which  was  to  be  handed  in  before  the  case
        proceeded. With Mr Ahmed's assistance a further  witness  statement
        dated 1 December 2017 was prepared. Mrs Aboni  was  given  time  to
        read  this  together  with  further  documents  provided   by   the
        appellant. No request for adjournment was made by either party.
    14. In the statement of 8 May 2015, the appellant confirmed he and  his
        wife married on 28 March 2013 and that they have been in a  genuine
        and subsisting  relationship  and  have  every  intention  to  live
        together as man and wife. The appellant claimed that he cannot live
        in India with his wife as she is a British  citizen  with  all  her
        family and ties to the UK and that she has never lived abroad.  The
        appellant stated his wife travelled to India before to see  whether
        or not she could reside in India but that she had difficulty in the
        change of climate and food. The appellant stated they maintain  and
        accommodate themselves without recourse to  public  funds  as  they
        have support of their families. The appellant claimed that if given
        permission to work he would enter into employment immediately as he
        provided letters  of  employment  which  confirmed  the  same.  The
        appellant claims he has family in the UK including a  maternal  and
        paternal family, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews. The appellant
        refers to the fact he has resided with an uncle with whom he has  a
        close bond since arriving in the UK and that  such  a  bond  exists
        with his uncle's children whom he claims to have had an active role
        in their upbringing; including collecting and dropping the  uncle's
        youngest child off at school. The family  members  in  the  UK  are
        settled or British Citizen's. The appellant asked  in  the  witness
        statement for discretion to be exercised in that he be permitted to
        remain in the UK with his wife.
    15. A witness statement of the same date  written  by  the  appellant's
        wife confirmed the marriage is genuine and subsisting  and  asserts
        that her husband should have the right to  live  and  work  in  the
        United  Kingdom.  The  appellant's  wife  claims  that  she  cannot
        relocate to India as she travelled there before  the  marriage  and
        after the marriage and found living there extremely  difficult  due
        to the climate, food and the people, claiming she would not be able
        to adjust as she has  always  lived  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The
        appellant's wife stated all her family live in the  United  Kingdom
        and that they would not be a burden upon the public purse.
    16. In his witness statement of the  1  December  2017,  the  appellant
        claimed that his mother-in-law is unwell  as  she  suffers  from  a
        number  of  medical  conditions  details  of  which  were  provided
        previously to the First-tier Tribunal.
    17. The appellant claimed that  as  a  result  of  his  mother-in-law's
        condition his wife has been spending time with her  in  Nottingham.
        It was claimed that the appellant's wife intended to  come  to  the
        hearing but as his mother-in-law has been unwell, as  a  result  of
        rising blood pressure, his wife had not  attended.  No  application
        for an adjournment to permit the appellant's wife to attend a later
        date was made. The appellant claims this was the  reason  both  his
        wife and mother-in-law had not  attended.  The  appellant  repeated
        this claim his wife could not return to India due to her mother and
        time in the United Kingdom and that if he is returned his wife will
        be unable to accompany him because of her mother and that it  would
        place his wife in an impossible situation.
    18. The written evidence stood as the evidence in chief of Mr Singh who
        was tendered for cross examination. In reply to  questions  put  by
        Mrs Aboni the appellant confirmed that he and his wife  have  since
        2014 lived at  the  address  in  Coventry  with  his  mother-in-law
        continuing to live in  Nottingham.  The  mother-in-law  lives  with
        other family  members  in  Nottingham  although  two  other  family
        members live elsewhere but return to visit.
    19.  The  appellant  stated  his  mother's  in-laws  medical  condition
        includes an inability to speak,  high  blood  pressure,  and  other
        issues, and when asked what care or assistance his wife provided he
        stated that when his mother-in-law goes to hospital his wife  helps
        and assists with medication and with the doctor.  His  wife  visits
        his mother-in-law three to four times a week.  When  asked  whether
        his  mother-in-law  received  assistance  outside  the  family  the
        appellant stated she did not as  he  and  his  wife  help.  He  was
        unaware of the benefits the mother-in-law received  but  was  aware
        that she did receive financial support.
    20. When the appellant was asked why he and his wife could  not  go  to
        India as there was other help in the United Kingdom, the  appellant
        stated his wife was from the United Kingdom and had not  gone  back
        to India and that she would not be able to live there and not work.
        When asked whether, if they went to India, he could  not  work  and
        support his wife the appellant claimed the  problem  was  that  his
        wife did not want to go  back  as  she  was  happy  in  the  United
        Kingdom. He did not think his wife would go to India  with  him  as
        she is caring for elderly parents. Her mother in law  is  not  well
        and his wife will not leave her. When asked why his wife was not at
        court to assist him it was claimed it was  because  his  mother-in-
        law's blood pressure had increased.



Discussion



    21. The appellant relies upon both the Immigration Rules  by  reference
        to EX.1 and article 8 ECHR.
    22. EX.1 states:


             EX.1. This paragraph applies if
             (a) (i) the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  parental
             relationship with a child who- (aa) is under  the  age  of  18
             years, or was under the age of 18 years when the applicant was
             first granted leave on the basis that this paragraph applied;
             (bb) is in the UK;
             (cc) is a British Citizen or has lived in the UK  continuously
             for at least the 7 years immediately  preceding  the  date  of
             application ;and


             (ii) taking into account their best  interests  as  a  primary
             consideration, it would not be reasonable to expect the  child
             to leave the UK; or


             (b) the applicant has a genuine  and  subsisting  relationship
             with a partner who is in the UK  and  is  a  British  Citizen,
             settled in  the  UK  or  in  the  UK  with  refugee  leave  or
             humanitarian  protection,   and   there   are   insurmountable
             obstacles to family life with that partner continuing  outside
             the UK.


             EX.2. For the purposes of paragraph  EX.1.(b)  "insurmountable
             obstacles" means the very significant difficulties which would
             be faced by the applicant or their partner in continuing their
             family life together outside the UK and  which  could  not  be
             overcome  or  would  entail  very  serious  hardship  for  the
             applicant or their partner.


    23. It is not disputed the  appellant  does  not  have  a  genuine  and
        subsisting parental relationship with a child.  He therefore  seeks
        to rely upon EX.1.(b). It is  not  disputed  the  appellant  has  a
        genuine and subsisting relationship with a partner, his  wife,  who
        is a British citizen. The issue  in  relation  to  this  aspect  is
        whether there are insurmountable obstacles to family  life  between
        the appellant and his wife continuing outside the United Kingdom.
    24. EX.2 defines, for the purposes of this aspect  of  the  rules,  the
        term "insurmountable obstacles". It was also held in Agyarko [2017]
        UKSC 11 that the definition of "insurmountable obstacles"  at  EX.2
        as meaning "very significant difficulties which would be  faced  by
        the applicant or their partner  in  continuing  their  family  life
        together outside the UK and which could not be  overcome  or  would
        entail very serious hardship for the applicant  or  their  partner"
        was consistent with Strasbourg case law.  The court referred to the
        case of Jeunesse v Netherlands.  Leave to remain would not normally
        be granted in cases where an applicant for leave  to  remain  under
        the partner route was in the UK  in  breach  of  immigration  laws,
        unless the applicant or their partner  would  face  "insurmountable
        obstacles" (as defined) in continuing their  family  life  together
        outside the UK.  Even in a case where  such  difficulties  did  not
        exist leave to remain could nevertheless  be  granted  outside  the
        rules (according to the IDIs) in "exceptional  circumstances"  i.e.
        "circumstances in which refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh
        consequences  for  the  individual  such  that   refusal   of   the
        application would  not  be  proportionate".   The  rules  and  IDIs
        together were compatible with Article 8.  This was not to say  that
        decisions in individual cases would necessarily be compatible  with
        Article 8.  "Exceptional circumstances" did not mean that a  unique
        or unusual feature  was  to  be  sought  and  in  its  absence  the
        application rejected.  A proportionality test  had  to  be  carried
        out.  A court or tribunal considering whether a refusal of leave to
        remain was compatible with Article 8 in the context  of  precarious
        family life had to decide whether the refusal was proportionate  in
        the particular case before it, balancing the strength of the public
        interest in the removal of  the  person  in  question  against  the
        impact on private and  family  life.   In  doing  so,  whilst  also
        considering all factors relevant to the specific case in  question,
        it should give appropriate  weight  to  the  Secretary  of  State's
        policy, expressed in the rules and instructions,  that  the  public
        interest in immigration control can be outweighed, when considering
        an application for leave to remain brought by a person in the UK in
        breach of immigration laws, only where  there  are  "insurmountable
        obstacles" or "exceptional circumstances" as defined. "The critical
        issue will generally be whether, giving due weight to the  strength
        of the public interest in the removal of the  person  in  the  case
        before it, the article 8 claim is sufficiently strong  to  outweigh
        it.  In general, in cases concerned with precarious family life,  a
        very strong or compelling claim is required to outweigh the  public
        interest in immigration control".
    25. The  Secretary  of  State's  position  has  always  been  that  the
        appellant has failed to  establish  that  insurmountable  obstacles
        exist and that the appellant's case is based solely on a preference
        to remain in the United Kingdom.
    26.  The  appellant  rests  his  claim  on  the  basis  of  the   wider
        circumstances of this family including those of his  mother-in-law.
        There is, however, little bar the appellants  evidence  to  support
        the  alleged  care  needs  and   little   evidence   from   medical
        professionals regarding the mother-in-law's medical situation or an
        assessment of her health needs or evidence to show that such  needs
        could not be met by either assistance from the  statutory  services
        or other family members. The failure of both the  appellant's  wife
        or any other family member to attend the hearing, combined with the
        failure to provide sufficient additional documentary evidence,  has
        not assisted the appellant's case.
    27. The evidence given by the appellant's wife to  First-tier  Tribunal
        Judge Juss, at [6 - 9] of the  First-tier  Tribunals  decision  has
        been recorded in the following terms:


                  6. The second witness was Ms Ravinder Kaur Gurcha and  she
                  adopted her witness statement dated 8 May 2015 (at pages 4
                  to 5).  She was asked why  she  could  not  accompany  the
                  Appellant to India. She  said  that  she  had  twice  been
                  there. The first time she went was two  weeks  before  she
                  got married she had also been there last  year.  She  said
                  that she suffered from asthma and this condition got worse
                  in India with the heat. She did not like the weather,  the
                  people, food. She explained that she ate Western  food  in
                  this country, including burgers and chips, and did not eat
                  Indian food. She also spoke  basic  Punjabi  and  was  not
                  fluent in Punjabi language  as  she  was  in  the  English
                  language. Moreover, she had three other  sisters  and  she
                  was the youngest. However, the duty of looking  after  her
                  mother fell on her and her husband.


                  7. This was because her eldest sister, who was  unmarried,
                  was much too focused on her work, and she would just go to
                  work and then return back at the end of  the  day  and  go
                  back to her room upstairs and not come downstairs to  help
                  her mother in any way. There were two other  sisters.  One
                  of them did not live with  her  parents.  The  other,  was
                  divorced, and she had two children, and she lived with her
                  parents in the same way as the eldest one did  also.  She,
                  however, because of her own commitments to  the  children,
                  was not in a position to look after their mother.


                  8. She then  explained  that  she  and  her  husband,  the
                  Appellant, lived in Coventry. Her mother,  however,  lived
                  in Nottingham. She said that the care  that  her  husband,
                  the Appellant, provided to his mother-in-law, was  on  the
                  basis of his leaving Coventry and going to Nottingham some
                  two to three times a week in order  to  provide  her  with
                  such assistance as she needed.


                  9. Recently, however, she had had an operation. Because of
                  this, she and her husband had actually  shifted  home  and
                  had now gone to Nottingham and were living with her mother
                  there until she was fully  recovered.  Finally,  she  said
                  that he would not be  able  to  go  to  India  to  make  a
                  spouse's application because her own earnings, working  as
                  a packer in a warehouse, were no  more  than  �10,000  per
                  annum. She was not  in  a  position  to  earn  �18,600  as
                  required by the Rules.


    28. Upper Tribunal Judge Storey in setting aside the decision of First-
        tier Tribunal Judge Juss noted  that  Mr  Mills,  the  Senior  Home
        Office Presenting Officer who represented the Secretary of State on
        that occasion, accepted that Judge Juss did not deal as well as  he
        should have with the question of whether the appellant was entitled
        to  succeed  outside  the  Rules  on  the   basis   of   compelling
        circumstances. Those circumstances are similar to those relied upon
        by the appellant  to  establish  the  existence  of  insurmountable
        obstacles although, as recognised by the Supreme Court, it  may  be
        possible for a person who is unable to establish the  existence  of
        insurmountable obstacles to succeed under article  8  ECHR  on  the
        basis of exceptional circumstances.
    29. In terms of the insurmountable obstacle test  and  paragraph  EX.1;
        this Tribunal finds that the appellant has failed to discharge  the
        burden upon him to the required standard to establish the existence
        of insurmountable obstacles. The definition of that  term  requires
        consideration of the existence  of  very  significant  difficulties
        which  would  be  faced  by  the  applicant  or  their  partner  in
        continuing their family life together  outside  the  UK  and  which
        could not be overcome or would entail very serious hardship for the
        applicant or their partner.  The appellant fails to  establish  any
        credible difficulties in he himself reintegrating into  society  in
        India or re-establishing himself within the  culture  of  his  home
        state. The appellant's wife refers to her experiences  in  relation
        to the climate and her asthma but fails to establish that  this  is
        an element that would create such difficulties, as this appears  to
        be related to a specific level of heat which is not established  as
        being a permanent feature  in  the  part  of  India  to  which  the
        appellant would relocate  or  that  appropriate  medical  treatment
        would not be available to treat any symptoms the  appellant's  wife
        experienced. It is in particular not made out that  the  effect  of
        the asthmatic condition could not be overcome or would entail  very
        serious hardship to the appellant's wife.
    30. Whilst it is accepted that moving to another country would entail a
        period  of  adjustment  and  settlement  the  appellant  fails   to
        establish that either he or his wife would  face  very  significant
        difficulties when adjusting to the climate, food,  or  persons  who
        they would interact with in India. Both are fluent in  Punjabi  and
        the appellant's  wife's  assertion  that  her  language  skills  in
        Punjabi are not the same as her skills in the English  language  is
        an understandable comment if English is her dominant language,  but
        it is clear that she has language skills in Punjabi and it  is  not
        made out she would not be able to communicate with those around her
        in India. It is  an  accepted  principle  that  a  person  who  has
        language  skills  will  normally  find  that   their   ability   to
        communicate and familiarity  with  another  language  increases  by
        living in an environment where that language is mainly  spoken.  In
        relation to the food; the appellant's wife may not  like  the  food
        when comparing it to that available in the United Kingdom but fails
        to establish that there is not a range of diet available  in  India
        or any health or other aspects that would suggest very  significant
        difficulties in adapting to a different diet.
    31. It is not made out the appellant will be unable to work in India or
        indeed his wife,  who  has  employment  experience  in  the  United
        Kingdom, would not be able to obtain  employment  from  which  they
        could earn an income and support themselves by  reference  to  both
        accommodation and other basic needs, including purchasing  food  of
        their choice.
    32. The position of the appellants mother in law is discussed below but
        taking that issues into account with the above, and  when  applying
        the correct test to the facts of this  matter,   I  find  that  the
        appellants fails to establish  an  entitlement  to  remain  in  the
        United Kingdom under the Immigration Rules.
    33. In relation to the position outside the Rules pursuant to article 8
        ECHR; Upper Tribunal Judge Storey found the failure of  Judge  Just
        to specifically conduct a fact sensitive assessment of whether  the
        appellant's circumstances warranted a grant of  leave  outside  the
        Rules on the basis  of  compelling  circumstances  was  a  material
        error.
    34. When considering  Article  8  ECHR  it  is  necessary  to  adopt  a
        structured approach. This is best achieved by  answering  the  five
        questions posed by the House of Lords in the case of Razgar  [2004]
        UKHL 27 which are:


        (1)  Will the proposed removal  be  an  interference  by  a  public
        authority with the exercise of the applicant's right to respect for
        his private or (as the case may be) family life?


        (2)  If so,  will  such  interference  have  consequences  of  such
        gravity as potentially to engage the operation of article 8?


        (3)  If so, is such interference in accordance with the law?


        (4)  If so, is such interference necessary in a democratic  society
        in the  interests  of  national  security,  public  safety  or  the
        economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of  disorder
        or crime, for the protection  of  health  or  morals,  or  for  the
        protection of the rights and freedoms of others?


        (5)  If so, is such interference proportionate  to  the  legitimate
        public end sought to be achieved?


    35. The appellant clearly enjoys family life recognised  by  article  8
        ECHR with his wife and she with him. The appellant clearly enjoys a
        private life in the United Kingdom. Upper Tribunal Judge Storey, at
        [5] of his decision, stated that had the First-tier Tribunal  Judge
        adopted a structured approach the first important  matter  that  he
        would have had to assess was whether the appellant enjoyed a family
        life relationship with his  mother-in-law  in  order  to  establish
        whether the contents of his Article 8(1) rights comprise more  than
        just a private life relationship with her.
    36. Whether the relationship is sufficient to satisfy the definition of
        family life recognised by Article 8 ECHR will depend  upon  whether
        it is a relationship that goes beyond normal emotional  ties.   The
        appellants evidence given in cross-examination is that he  and  his
        wife continue to live in their home in Coventry and have not  moved
        to Nottingham to  live  with  the  appellants  mother-in-law  on  a
        permanent basis. The claim to have moved to  Nottingham  to  assist
        the mother-in-law made before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  can  only
        therefore have been a reference to a temporary arrangement.
    37. Whilst the appellant claims to provide assistance to his mother-in-
        law it appears that it is was  wife  rather  than  he  himself  who
        visits to assist her mother with attending  hospital  appointments,
        GP visits, and taking her medication.
    38. In S v UK [1984] 40 DR 196 Sedley LJ made it  clear  that  "Neither
        blood ties nor the concern and affection that  ordinarily  go  with
        them are, by  themselves  altogether,  in  my  judgment  enough  to
        constitute family life.  Most of us have close relations of whom we
        are extremely fond and whom we visit, or who visit us, from time to
        time; but none of us would say on those grounds alone that we  have
        a family life with them in any sense capable of coming  within  the
        meaning and purpose of Article 8".
    39. In Kugathas v SSHD (2003) INLR 170 the Court of Appeal  said  that,
        in order to establish family life, it is  necessary  to  show  that
        there is a real committed  or  effective  support  or  relationship
        between the family members and the normal emotional ties between  a
        mother and an adult son would not, without more, be enough.
    40. In Samsonnikov v Estonia (Application no.  52178/10)  ECtHR  (First
        Section) the Applicant argued that he had close  family  ties  with
        his father and brother  and  that  they  were  dependent  upon  one
        another owing to the Applicant's HIV/Hepatitis C and  his  father's
        advanced age.  It was held that  those  relations  did  not  extend
        beyond the usual ties between grown-up family members as the father
        lived separately with his partner and the Applicant's brother  also
        had a family of his own.
    41. The question of whether family life  exists  is  a  fact  sensitive
        issue  although  whether  it  is  necessary  to   identify   if   a
        relationship constitutes family or private life can be an  academic
        question. In Vikas and Manesh Singh (2015) EWCA Civ 630  the  Court
        of Appeal said the factors  to  be  examined  in  order  to  assess
        proportionality were the same, regardless  of  whether  private  or
        family life was engaged. To that extent the debate in this case  as
        to whether there was family life was described as academic.
    42. In relationship to the appellants ties with his wife's family it is
        not disputed that he visits or that he may  provide  some  support.
        What the appellant arguably fails to establish is that  the  nature
        of the support he provides is of  significance  to  his  mother-in-
        law's welfare within the United Kingdom. It is  accepted,  however,
        that the overall relationship between the appellant and his mother-
        in-law forms a strong element of his private life.
    43. It is accepted that the appellant's  wife  has  maintained  a  more
        active  role  in  assisting  her  mother  with  her  health  issues
        including staying with her at  Nottingham  when  she  feels  it  is
        necessary to do so. The issue in this case is whether the  required
        element of dependency has been established in a situation where  it
        appears there are a number of other family members  living  in  the
        property in Nottingham some of whom appeared,  by  choice,  not  to
        assist the appellants mother-in-law to the  extent  that  they  may
        well be able. It is accepted that if the daughter  referred  to  by
        the First-tier Tribunal was working she may be unable to  take  her
        mother to  all  her  medical  appointments  but  it  has  not  been
        established that other family members could not provide  assistance
        or that alternative arrangements could not be  made.  Although  the
        mother-in-law appears to be in receipt of benefit payments there is
        no evidence that she has sought or  been  refused  assistance  with
        attending hospital appointments or appointments with her GP if  the
        appellant's wife was not available as a  result  of  travelling  to
        India with her husband. The mother in law also reside sin  her  own
        family unit in Nottingham.
    44. It has not been made out that the appellants mother-in-law, even if
        she would prefer the current arrangements to continue, would suffer
        a disproportionately adverse effect if the appellant and  his  wife
        were unable to continue with the assistance they currently provide.
        It is noted in this respect that the appellant's  evidence  to  the
        Upper Tribunal on this occasion is that his wife visits his  mother
        in Nottingham on a number of occasions during the week but does not
        live with her permanently, indicating that on those occasions  when
        the appellant's  wife  is  not  present  either  his  mother-in-law
        maintains her own care and medication regime or has  the  necessary
        assistance to do so. Whilst it may be the choice of the family unit
        to share caring arrangements it has not been made out that  if  the
        appellant's wife  is  not  available  the  care  the  mother-in-law
        requires will not be forthcoming.
    45. As stated, neither the appellant's wife nor mother-in-law  attended
        to give evidence and have  failed  to  provide  up-to-date  medical
        evidence regarding the mother-in-law's health needs.
    46. Considering the second of the Razgar questions; the removal of  the
        appellant from the United Kingdom  accompanied  by  his  wife  will
        alter the nature of the relationship sufficient to engage article 8
        as the  role  they  currently  undertake  will  not  be  physically
        possible if the appellant and  his  wife  are  residing  elsewhere.
        Whilst alternative care arrangements can be made, the private  life
        aspects which involve the visits to Nottingham  and  what  develops
        during the same cannot be maintained.
    47. It is not  disputed  that  the  third  and  fourth  of  the  Razgar
        questions will be answered in the affirmative, making issue in this
        appeal that of the proportionality of the decision.
    48. It is necessary when undertaking any article 8 assessment  to  take
        into account the statutory provisions contained in section  117  of
        the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.
    49. By virtue of section  117A,  in  considering  the  public  interest
        question, the tribunal must (in particular) have regard (a) in  all
        cases, to the considerations listed in section  117B,  and  (b)  in
        cases concerning the  deportation  of  foreign  criminals,  to  the
        considerations listed in section 117C. Subsection (2) provides that
        "the public interest question" means the  question  of  whether  an
        interference with a person's  right  to  respect  for  private  and
        family life is justified under Article  8(2).  Section  117A(2)  is
        mandatory.  As the public  interest  provisions  are  contained  in
        primary  legislation  they  override  existing  case  law.  Section
        117A(3) confirms that the Tribunal  is  required  to  carry  out  a
        balancing exercise.  In other words, the Tribunal cannot just  rely
        on the listed public interest factors as a basis  for  rejecting  a
        claim but must carry out a  balancing  exercise  where  a  person's
        circumstances engage article 8(1) to decide  whether  the  proposed
        interference is proportionate in all the circumstances.
    50. Section 117B: The  section  reads  -  Article  8:  public  interest
        considerations applicable  in  all  cases:  (1)The  maintenance  of
        effective immigration controls is in the public interest; (2) It is
        in the public interest, and in particular in the interests  of  the
        economic well-being of the United Kingdom, that persons who seek to
        enter or remain in the United Kingdom are able  to  speak  English,
        because persons who can speak English- (a) are less of a burden  on
        taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into  society;  (3)
        It is in the public interest, and in particular in the interests of
        the economic well-being of the United  Kingdom,  that  persons  who
        seek to enter or remain  in  the  United  Kingdom  are  financially
        independent,  because  such  persons-  (a)  are  not  a  burden  on
        taxpayers, and (b) are better able to integrate into  society;  (4)
        Little weight should be given to- (a)  a private life,  or  (b)   a
        relationship formed with a qualifying partner,  that is established
        by a person at a time when the person  is  in  the  United  Kingdom
        unlawfully; (5) Little weight should be given  to  a  private  life
        established by a person at a time  when  the  person's  immigration
        status is precarious; (6) In the case of a person who is not liable
        to deportation, the public interest does not require  the  person's
        removal where- (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting parental
        relationship with a qualifying child,  and  (b)  it  would  not  be
        reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom.
    51. In relation to the appellant's status in the United Kingdom, it  is
        noted that he entered the United Kingdom as a  visitor  with  leave
        valid to 26 October 2010.  Subsequent  applications  for  leave  to
        remain have been refused indicating the appellants presence in  the
        United Kingdom has since the expiry of his visa been in  breach  of
        UK immigration laws. The granting of a Certificate of Approval  for
        marriage did not confer  leave  to  remain.  For  the  purposes  of
        section 117B (4) the appellants status has, since  his  visit  visa
        expired, always been unlawful.
    52. In Akinyemi v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 236 it was  held  that  for  the
        purposes of section 117B (4) the reference to a person being in the
        UK "unlawfully" was a reference to their presence being  in  breach
        of UK law.
    53. The period of leave covered by the visit visa was for  a  temporary
        purpose and the appellants status therefore precarious. In Rhuppiah
        [2016] EWCA Civ 803 it was held that the concept of  precariousness
        in immigration status in section  117B(5)  was  distinct  from  the
        concept of unlawful presence in the UK in subsection (4).  Even  if
        the two concepts could be said to overlap, subsection (5) would  be
        redundant if they were the  same.  The  concept  of  precariousness
        extended more widely, to include people who had leave to  enter  or
        remain which was qualified to a degree such that they knew from the
        outset that their permission to be in the UK could be described  as
        precarious. The extension and  re-extension  of  limited  leave  to
        remain did  not  mean  that  the  person's  status  was  not  still
        precarious. In the  context  of  section  117B,  the  relevance  of
        precariousness of immigration status was the effect it had  on  the
        extent of protection which should be afforded to private  life  for
        the purposes of the Article 8 proportionality  balancing  exercise.
        The more that an immigrant should be taken to have understood  that
        his or her time in the host country would be comparatively short or
        would be liable to termination, the more the host State was able to
        say that a fair balance between the rights of  the  individual  and
        the general public interest in the firm  and  fair  enforcement  of
        immigration controls should come down in favour of removal when the
        leave expired (paras 30 - 34).
    54. It is not disputed that the appellant is able to speak English.
    55. It is not made out  that  the  appellant  is,  in  his  own  right,
        financially independent. The  appellant's  wife  accepts  that  her
        level of earned income falls below the minimum requirements of  the
        Immigration Rules but also  claims  that  as  a  result  of  family
        support the appellant is not a burden on the public purse.
    56. The appellant claims to have an offer  of  employment.  In  finding
        First-tier Tribunal  erred  in  law  Upper  Tribunal  Judge  Storey
        comments  at  [9]  of  the  need  for  the  tribunal   to   require
        considerably more  help  from  the  appellant's  representative  as
        regards full details of the job offered to the appellant so  as  to
        assess its  efficacy  and  the  extent  of  the  appellants  wife's
        financial assistance  to  the  mother-in-law.  The  appellant  has,
        again, failed to provide sufficient or  adequate  evidence  dealing
        with these specific issues.
    57. It is accepted that there is within the bundle dated 15 May 2015  a
        letter from TG Bros LTD dated 12 May 2015 stating there is a  full-
        time job vacancy available to the holder of that letter  commencing
        immediately although they will only employ  workers  with  a  valid
        National Insurance number and permanent stay  Visa  in  the  United
        Kingdom.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  appellant  had   been
        interviewed or deemed to have the necessary skills for the  job  in
        hand and the letter appears to have been signed by a wages clerk.
    58. A letter by the appellant's current  solicitors,  dated  5  October
        2017,  contains  a  letter  purportedly  from  the   same   company
        confirming  the  appellant  has  a  position  in  the  company  for
        tailoring and pressing/packing clothes together with the need for a
        delivery person. There is, again, no indication  of  any  interview
        having been conducted or of the appellant establishing  whether  he
        has the required skills to undertake any of the work envisaged. The
        letter on  this  occasion  purports  to  be  signed  by  a  company
        director. It is accepted that the company TG Bros Ltd is registered
        at Companies House as a clothing manufacturer and that  the  nature
        of business is stated to be the manufacture of textiles  and  as  a
        wholesaler of clothing and footwear. There is no  evidence  of  the
        alleged vacancies having been advertised in local  job  centres  or
        elsewhere to establish that they are bona fides  job  opportunities
        which will  guarantee  realistic  prospects  of  employment  and  a
        sufficient rate of income to the appellant.
    59. I have commented above on the appellant's immigration status in the
        United Kingdom and the reference in section 117B(4) which  provides
        that little weight should be given to- (a)  a private life, or  (b)
        a  relationship  formed  with  a  qualifying  partner,    that   is
        established by a person at a time when the person is in the  United
        Kingdom unlawfully.
    60. Section 117B(5) also provides that little weight should be given to
        a private life established by a person at a time when the  person's
        immigration status is precarious.
    61. Section 117B(6) provides that in the case of a person  who  is  not
        liable to deportation, the public interest  does  not  require  the
        person's removal where- (a) the person has a genuine and subsisting
        parental relationship with a qualifying child, and (b) it would not
        be reasonable to expect the child to leave the United Kingdom. This
        is not relevant as there is no qualifying child.
    62. In relation to the income requirements, the Supreme Court  in  R(on
        the application of MM (Lebanon) and Others) v  Secretary  of  State
        for the Home Department [2017] UKSC 10 held that the  challenge  to
        the acceptability in principle of the  minimum  income  requirement
        failed.  The minimum income requirement pursued the legitimate  aim
        of ensuring so far as was practicable that a couple  did  not  have
        recourse to welfare benefits and had  sufficient  resources  to  be
        able to play a full part in  British  life.   That  legitimate  aim
        justified interference with Article 8  rights.   However:  (i)  the
        rules left a gap regarding the welfare of children  which  was  not
        adequately filled by the instructions to entry  clearance  officers
        particularly so far as treating the best interests of children as a
        primary consideration was concerned.  The rules  failed  unlawfully
        to give effect to the duty under s55 of the 2009 Act in respect  of
        the welfare of children and the instructions  were  also  unlawful;
        (ii) So far as alternative funding sources were concerned (such  as
        prospective  earnings  of  the  foreign  partner  or  third   party
        support), whilst it was not irrational for the Secretary  of  State
        to give priority in the rules to simplicity of operation  and  ease
        of verification, operation of the same restrictive approach outside
        the rules was a different matter and much more difficult to justify
        under the Human Rights Act.  Nothing said in  the  instructions  to
        case officers could prevent the tribunal on appeal from looking  at
        the  matter  more  broadly.   There  was  nothing  to  prevent  the
        tribunal, in the context of the Human Rights Appeal,  from  judging
        for itself the reliability of any alternative sources of finance in
        the light of the evidence before it. In so doing, it would no doubt
        take account of such considerations as were discussed  in  Mahad  v
        Entry Clearance Officer [2009] UKSC 16 including  the  difficulties
        of proving third party support.
    63. The assertion the appellant shall  not  be  dependent  upon  public
        funding as a result of family support was not adequately  evidenced
        on the basis of the information  made  available  in  this  appeal,
        notwithstanding that if the �10,000 earned by the appellant's  wife
        was accepted a sum of less than this would have to be proved to  be
        available by way of third-party support to meet the minimum  income
        requirements.
    64. Article 8 is not about allowing a person to choose where they  wish
        to live. It  is  about  preventing  unwarranted  interference  with
        protected rights. The appellant's immigration history shows that he
        has never had lawful leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  on  a
        settled or permanent basis and no legitimate expectation that  such
        leave would be granted. The appellant is unable  to  succeed  under
        the Immigration Rules  and  has  failed  to  establish  that  those
        matters  he  relies  upon,  in  support  of  his  claim  that   the
        respondent's decision  is  disproportionate,  make  out  his  case.
        Having weighed the competing interests it is the  finding  of  this
        tribunal that the Secretary of State has discharged the  burden  of
        proof upon her to the  required  standard  to  establish  that  the
        decision to remove the appellant from the United Kingdom in all the
        circumstances  of  this   appeal   amounts   to   a   proportionate
        interference  with  the  protected  rights  relied  upon   by   the
        appellant.  Giving  due  weight  to  the  strength  of  the  public
        interest in the removal of the appellant his article 8 claim is not
        sufficiently strong to outweigh it.
    65. In relation to other family members it is not  made  out  that  any
        disruption with a protected right they may enjoy is  sufficient  to
        warrant a finding in the alternative.

Decision

    66. I remake the decision as follows. This appeal is dismissed.
