                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Dean promulgated on 17 January 2017.



2.   The Appellant is a citizen of Pakistan  born  on  15  April  1985.   He
    entered the United Kingdom on 27 November 2009 as a student with a visa
    conferring leave until 31 January 2011.  He then  made  an  application
    for variation of leave to remain as a Tier 4 Migrant which was  granted
    on 4 February 2011 with leave until 30 January 2012.  Thereafter on  24
    May 2012 he was granted further leave to remain until 24 May 2014 as  a
    Tier 1 (Post-Study) Migrant.  On 20 April 2014 he made  an  application
    as a Tier 1 Entrepreneur.  The application  was  made  as  part  of  an
    entrepreneurial team alongside a Mr Sajjad  Ahmed  (date  of  birth  10
    August 1984).



3.   The Appellant was interviewed in relation  to  the  application  on  27
    June 2014 On 8 July 2014 his application was refused:  he  was  refused
    variation of leave to remain and the Respondent also made a decision to
    remove him pursuant to  section  47  of  the  Immigration,  Asylum  and
    Nationality Act 2006.



4.   The Appellant appealed to the IAC.



5.   The appeal was dismissed for reasons set out in the decision of  First-
    tier Tribunal Judge Dean.



6.   The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    which was granted by Designated First-tier Tribunal Judge McCarthy on 1
    August 2017.



7.   Judge McCarthy considered a number of grounds  of  challenge  but  only
    granted permission to appeal in respect  of  two.   In  particular  the
    Judge granted permission: in respect of a pleading to the  effect  that
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge had failed to make a finding in  relation
    to a bank certificate dated 24 June 2014; and in respect of a challenge
    to the effect  that  Judge  Dean  had  taken  into  account  immaterial
    factors, specifically the Appellant's failure  to  provide  a  business
    bank  statement  when  no  such  statement  was  required   under   the
    Immigration Rules.  Judge McCarthy however rejected grounds in  respect
    of a bank certificate dated 20 May 2014, and also rejected  grounds  in
    respect  of  the  Judge's  refusal  to  grant  an  adjournment  in  the
    circumstance of the Appellant's absence from the hearing.



8.   Before turning to the substance of the challenge to  the  Judge  Dean's
    Decision it is important to understand the context of  the  appeal:  in
    that  regard  it  is  instructive  to  consider  the  contents  of  the
    Respondent's 'reasons for refusal' letter ('RFRL').



9.   The RFRL sets out rejections of numerous  aspects  of  the  Appellant's
    application with reference to the requirements of the Immigration Rules
    in respect of a Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) application.  The Respondent  was
    not satisfied as to the viability and  credibility  of  the  source  of
    money that the Appellant claimed to be available for his business;  was
    not satisfied in respect  of  the  viability  and  credibility  of  the
    Appellant's business plans and the market research carried out into the
    chosen sector; and was not  satisfied  that  the  Appellant's  previous
    educational and business experience were such  to  demonstrate  he  was
    sufficiently experienced to pursue the project proposed.



10.  For present purposes it is particularly pertinent to quote the RFRL  in
    respect of the viability and credibility of the source of funds:

         "You have stated that you have �50,000 available for investment  in
         your business, Watford Business Consultants Ltd.

         You have provided a letter from Barclays Bank stating that at close
         of business on 20 May 2014, the joint current account held a credit
         of �52,000.00.  It is noted that this letter is dated 20 May  2014,
         so it is not clear how it is known that the balance was  �52,000.00
         at the close of play the same day.

         You have not provided any bank statements for  the  joint  personal
         account,  or  for  the  business  account  for   Watford   Business
         Consultants Ltd.  The statement provided for your maintenance funds
         is clearly for an account that is not used regularly.  The  account
         was opened on 07 February 2014, with a  transfer  of  �2,000.   You
         have not provided any evidence of the source of the funds,  or  how
         long the funds have been available to you.

         You have stated that the �50,000 investment comes from yourself and
         your team member, Sajjad Ahmed, with �25,000 being invested by each
         of you.  You have stated that your share of the funds is from  your
         personal savings, from the work you have done over the  last  three
         years.  I do not find it credible that you could  save  �25,000  in
         three years when you state you have worked as a 'Reception security
         mix of job'.

         You have also stated that the �15,155.12 available in your business
         account is from yourself and your team member.  'We give  directors
         loan to the business because we are not putting �50,000 in business
         until Home Office allows, gives us visas'.  This suggests  you  are
         only stating that you have �50,000 to meet the requirements of  the
         Tier 1 Entrepreneur scheme on paper, and the  necessary  funds  are
         only �15,000.

         I am not satisfied that the  �50,000  is  genuinely  available  for
         investment in your business in the UK.  You have not  provided  any
         evidence of the source of the funds, and as such, I  have  concerns
         over the viability and credibility of the genuine  availability  of
         the funds."




11.  It is absolutely transparent from this passage  that  the  Respondent's
    decision-maker was not satisfied that the  Appellant  had  demonstrated
    that his share of the �50,000 investment -  that  is  say  his  claimed
    �25,000 - was money genuinely available to the Appellant (and therefore
    genuinely available to be invested in the business enterprise  by  him)
    because he  had  not  satisfactorily  explained  and  demonstrated  its
    source.



12.  The Appellant's first response to the Respondent's decision was by  way
    of his Notice of Appeal and Grounds of Appeal.   Although  the  Grounds
    are somewhat lengthy,  upon  careful  consideration,  they  essentially
    comprise a series of generic assertions as to error with  such  phrases
    as "the decision is not in accordance with the law", the  "decision  is
    capricious and based on  erroneous  understanding  of  the  immigration
    rules", "is ultra vires and arbitrary".  There is  precious  little  by
    way of analysis of the  Respondent's  actual  decision,  and  there  is
    nothing by way of explanation as  to  the  source  of  the  Appellant's
    funds.  In substance these are essentially empty grounds.



13.  The next response of the Appellant to the Respondent's decision was  by
    way of the materials filed  in  the  appeal.   The  Appellant's  appeal
    bundle includes witness statements from both Mr Sajjad  Ahmed  and  the
    Appellant.  The Appellant's statement, signed by  him  on  28  December
    2014, contains absolutely no reference to the source of the �25,000  he
    claimed to have genuinely available  for  investment  in  the  business
    enterprise. The Appellant did produce three  P60s  in  respect  of  his
    employment, being for the tax years ending April 2012, April  2013  and
    April 2014.  Whilst those demonstrate on their face that the  Appellant
    was earning a gross figure before tax of just over �18,000 in the first
    of those years, just over �33,000  in  the  second,  and  approximately
    �29,500 in the third of those  years,  there  was  nothing  further  to
    demonstrate what the Appellant's outgoings had been during this period:
    in  particular  there  was  nothing  by  way  of  bank  statements   to
    demonstrate that the Appellant had indeed been  able  to  save  �25,000
    during the time of his employment in the UK, as he had claimed  in  the
    course of his application when challenged on funds.



14.  In short, the Appellant put nothing of substance before the  First-tier
    Tribunal to address the concerns that had been so clearly expressed  in
    the RFRL.



15.  It is to be recalled - as indicated in my reference  to  the  grant  of
    permission to appeal - that the Appellant did  not  attend  before  the
    First-tier Tribunal and accordingly gave no oral evidence.  Nor does it
    appear that Mr Sajjad  Ahmed,  his  proposed  entrepreneurial  partner,
    attended the First-tier Tribunal hearing. (As an  aside  it  is  to  be
    noted that by the date of the  appeal  hearing  Mr  Ahmed  had  secured
    indefinite leave to remain by some other route, and there was no up-to-
    date evidence before the First-tier Tribunal that Mr  Ahmed  was  still
    interested in, intent upon, or otherwise  committed  to,  the  proposed
    entrepreneurial scheme.)



16.  It is against this background and  context  that  I  now  turn  to  the
    substance of the challenge to the Decision of Judge Deans.



17.  There were before the First-tier Tribunal, as  indeed  there  had  been
    before the Secretary of State, two very similar letters  from  Barclays
    Bank in respect of the  balance  in  the  joint  account  held  by  the
    Appellant and Mr Ahmed.  These are what have been referred  to  in  the
    grant of permission to appeal as the 'bank certificates'.



18.  The document dated 20 May 2014 has  been  expressly  addressed  by  the
    First-tier Tribunal Judge in similar terms to the way it was  addressed
    in the RFRL.  The document itself is in these terms:

         "I hereby certify that at the close of business on 20 May 2014  the
         Current account of Mr Ahmed and Mr Miraj showed a credit balance of
         �52,000.00".

    The Judge, echoing the RFRL, said this at paragraph 12:

         "The letter was written on 20 May 2014 and I  find  it  implausible
         that the Bank would be able to certify the closing  credit  balance
         on the same day.  I therefore attach little weight to this letter."



19.  There was a further similar letter dated 24 June 2014.   It  is  signed
    by the same person as the letter of 20 May 2014 and is in  exactly  the
    same terms save that it refers to a close of  business  balance  on  24
    June 2014 of �50,100.



20.  It is true to say that  the  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge  has  made  no
    express reference to the letter of 24 June 2014.  However, it seems  to
    me that the letter  is  vulnerable  to  the  same  criticisms  as  were
    expressed in respect of the letter of 20 May 2014.  To that extent I do
    not see that the Judge's failure to make express reference to it  could
    have had any material impact on this appeal.   It  is  clear  that  the
    Judge considered a letter dated on the same day for which it  purported
    to show a closing balance was a document upon which little weight could
    be attached.



21.  In any event, even if it were otherwise, neither of these documents  go
    anywhere towards addressing the core issue - the source  of  the  funds
    that were said to be  in  the  account.  Therefore,  in  my  judgement,
    neither of these letters were ultimately material to the issue  that  I
    have identified from the RFRL as being at the core of the  Respondent's
    concerns in respect of the genuine availability of funds.



22.  I conclude that the Judge's failure to make express  reference  to  the
    document of 24 June 2014 was not material. Moreover, given the lack  of
    materiality of this document to the core issue I do not  consider  that
    there was a deficiency of reasons constituting an error of law.



23.  The second ground  of  challenge  is  the  allegation  that  the  Judge
    wrongly expected the Appellant  to  produce  bank  statements  for  the
    business's bank accounts.



24.  What the Judge says at paragraph 13 is this:

         "Furthermore, the Appellant has not only failed to submit any  bank
         statements for the joint current  account,  but  he  has  also  not
         submitted any bank statements for the business account  of  Watford
         Business Consultants Ltd,  the  credit  balance  of  which  is  the
         subject of a letter from Barclays Bank dated 24 May.   Accordingly,
         when taken in the round, I find the  absence  of  the  firm's  bank
         statements undermines the credibility of the Appellant's account of
         the facts".



25.  It seems to me absolutely clear that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was
    not there saying that it was  a  requirement  of  the  Rules  that  the
    Appellant produce statements for the business's  bank  accounts.   What
    the Judge is very  clearly  saying  is  that  the  failure  to  produce
    business bank statement meant that it was  not  clear  from  where  the
    Appellant had sourced his funds.  This again  was  a  matter  expressly
    raised in the RFRL. Plainly  production  of  relevant  bank  statements
    would have assisted in evaluating the source of  funds  claimed  to  be
    genuinely available.  It seems to me that the Judge was doing  no  more
    than identifying that by the time of the appeal the Appellant had  done
    nothing to correct the omission of such statements raised in the  RFRL,
    and that the  failure  to  provide  evidence  that  should  be  readily
    available to the Appellant undermined his credibility.



26.  Whilst it may well be  that  there  are  certain  specified  evidential
    requirements under the Rules, it does not follow that an  applicant  is
    entitled to succeed on a Tier 1 Entrepreneur application simply because
    they have produced those required documents.  There is more to a Tier 1
    Entrepreneur application than a document checklist - as is evident from
    the  careful  assessment  of  the  viability  of  both   the   business
    proposition and the viability and availability  of  the  claimed  funds
    required under the Rules.  If challenged in respect of  these  aspects,
    it is entirely reasonable to  expect  an  applicant  (and  in  turn  an
    appellant) to bring forward available and relevant evidence to  address
    any concerns - irrespective of whether such materials  are  an  express
    requirement specified under the Rules. In all of the  circumstances  of
    any particular case, it may then be open to a decision-maker or a Judge
    to draw adverse inferences from the failure to provide such  evidential
    materials.



27.  It seems to me that this Appellant singularly  failed  to  address  the
    case against him  raised  by  the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department in any of his Grounds of Appeal, his witness  statement,  or
    the materials in his appeal bundle.  To that extent there was no  merit
    in his appeal before the First-tier Tribunal. In turn I see no merit in
    his appeal to the Upper Tribunal.


Notice of Decision

28.  The Decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained no error of  law  and
stands.


29.  The appeal remains dismissed.


30.  No anonymity direction is sought or made.



The above represents a corrected transcript of ex tempore reasons  given  at
the conclusion of the hearing.
