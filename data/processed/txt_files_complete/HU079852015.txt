                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. This is an appeal against a determination of First-tier Tribunal  Judge
    V Jones, promulgated on 15th November  2016,  following  a  hearing  at
    Birmingham Sheldon Court on 20th October 2016.  In  the  determination,
    the judge allowed the appeal of the Appellant, whereupon the Respondent
    subsequently applied for, and was granted, permission to appeal to  the
    Upper Tribunal, and thus the matter comes before me.

The Appellant

 2. The Appellant is a female, a citizen of Pakistan, who was born on  14th
    December 1994.  She appealed against the  decision  of  the  Respondent
    dated 27th August 2015, refusing her application for entry clearance to
    join her partner, Mr Adil  Hussain,  the  Sponsor,  who  is  a  British
    citizen settled in  the  UK.   The  applicable  Immigration  Rules  are
    paragraph EC-P.1.1(d) with reference to E-ECP.3.1, of Appendix FM.

 3. The basis of the Appellant's claim is that she had to comply  with  the
    �18,600  income  requirement  for  her  sponsoring  husband,  but   the
    difficulty in relation to providing proof of this arose from  the  fact
    that the Sponsor had two employments.   His  principal  employment  was
    with CPB UK Ltd, a small marketing company.  His second employment  was
    with AZB Castle Cars Ltd.  The Appellant had  submitted  payslips  from
    the Sponsor for both employments covering the six month period prior to
    the application  (January  2015  to  June  2015).   The  personal  bank
    statements for this period showed in each case that  salary  was  being
    paid into the Sponsor's account.  He  had  also  submitted  P60s.   The
    Sponsor had then asked both his employers to provide him with a  letter
    which was required by Appendix FM-SE.  AZB Castle Cars Ltd  were  happy
    to oblige.  However, the director of CPB UK Ltd refused saying that all
    the  information  that  was  needed  was  contained  in  the  Sponsor's
    payslips, and his contract of employment, and he did not  wish  to  get
    involved in the Sponsor's  personal  affairs.   This  resulted  in  the
    initial application  before  the  ECO  being  refused,  and  when  that
    happened, the Sponsor went back to the director of AZB Castle Cars  Ltd
    again, and this time showed him the refusal letter and implored him  to
    provide the letter in the  terms  required,  which  the  director  then
    agreed to do.  However, the information  in  some  respects  was  still
    incomplete in this letter.  He had simply stated that the  Sponsor  was
    being paid "�18,500 plus commission".  He did not  state  whether  this
    was gross or net or the period on which  the  salary  was  being  paid.
    When the matter went to the ECM the refusal was upheld.

The Judge's Findings

 4. The judge allowed the appeal.  She did so  on  the  following  grounds.
    First, she had found the Sponsor to "be a credible witness" and  accept
    his evidence as to the reasons he was unable to provide a  letter  with
    the requisite information" (paragraph 20).

 5. Second, the ECO did  not  exercise  discretion  under  paragraph  D  of
    Appendix FM-SE, when this could have been done, and in this respect the
    judge held that it  was  not  correct  for  the  ECO  not  to  exercise
    discretion in the Appellant's favour.  This is because,  as  the  judge
    explained,

         "There was only one difference: the missing letter from CPB UK Ltd.
          However, the Appellant did not make it clear  in  her  application
         why she had been unable to obtain a letter from CPB or  invite  the
         ECO to exercise discretion to waive the requirement for the letter"
         (paragraph 21).

 6. Third, in coming to this  conclusion,  the  judge  had  regard  to  the
    "maintenance  of  fair   and   effective   immigration   control"   and
    acknowledged that the case of  SS  (Congo)  [2015]  EWCA  Civ  387  had
    emphasised the importance of both  substantive  and  evidential  Rules.
    The judge noted that there are bound to be unreasonable  employers  who
    will not assist their employees and the lack of  the  specified  letter
    should not in these circumstances weigh heavily in the  proportionality
    exercise (see paragraph 24).  It was noted by the judge that  this  was
    not a case where the Appellant was in a position to reapply  for  entry
    clearance and produce all the specified evidence.  She  recognised  the
    Sponsor's evidence having some force, "that he will  have  considerable
    difficulty obtaining the specified letter from CPB UK Ltd and there  is
    a real possibility that such a request  will  damage  his  relationship
    with his employer" (paragraph 28).

 7. Ultimately, what the judge placed her decision upon was that, "if  that
    is the case, and the ECO is not prepared to exercise  discretion  under
    paragraph D(b) in the Appellant's failure, her application  will  again
    fall to be refused" (paragraph 28).

 8. The judge went on to note that, "the only alternative will be  for  him
    to give up his secure employment, try to find a new  job  with  a  more
    cooperative employer in the UK or go to  live  with  the  Appellant  in
    Pakistan where he would need to find new employment.   His  wife  lives
    with her parents and does not work".

 9. The judge went on to say that "the effects of maintaining this decision
    would amount to a  disproportionate  interference  with  the  Sponsor's
    private life" (paragraph 30).

Grounds of Application

10. The grounds of application state that the judge erred in  allowing  the
    appeal  in  finding  that  there  were  compelling  circumstances   not
    sufficient to be recognised by the Immigration Rules.   The  judge  had
    found that  the  required  income  was  present  at  the  date  of  the
    application but one of the Sponsor's employers was unwilling to provide
    a letter which complies with the requirements of Appendix  FM-SE.   The
    judge was wrong to conclude that this was  an  exceptional  case  where
    there were compelling circumstances to allow  the  appeal  outside  the
    Rules.

11. On 19th April 2017, permission to appeal was granted by the Tribunal.

Submissions

12. At the hearing before me  on  15th  June  2017  the  Sponsor,  Mr  Adil
    Hussain, attended court, but was unrepresented.  When the  court  clerk
    telephoned the solicitors, she was told that they  were  not  sent  the
    notice of hearing.  Upon checking the court clerk was able  to  confirm
    to me that this was not the case and that a notice of hearing had  been
    sent to the solicitors.  Mr Adil  Hussain  himself,  upon  arriving  at
    court explained that his solicitors were fully aware that there  was  a
    hearing today but had chosen not to attend.

13. I regard the explanation given by those representing the  Appellant  to
    be unsatisfactory when it is simply not the  case  that  no  notice  of
    hearing was overlooked by the Tribunal Service and  they  were  put  on
    notice of this hearing.

14. Given that this was the Respondent's appeal, Mr  Singh  submitted  that
    the judge below  had  accepted  that  the  employer's  letter  was  not
    provided by the director of AZB Castle Cars Ltd.  This meant  that  the
    Rules in Appendix FM-SE could not be  complied  with.   The  fact  that
    there was a difficult employer who was unwilling to assist the employee
    did not mean that this was a "compelling circumstance".  This is  clear
    in the way  that  the  judge  who  granted  permission  to  appeal  had
    expressed his concerns over the decision.  It is also incorrect to  say
    that, "the Sponsor explained that they had not realised the letter  was
    mandatory" (paragraph  21),  given  that  it  is  well-known  that  the
    disclosure  of  such  a  letter  is   indeed   mandatory.    In   these
    circumstances, it was not open to the judge to go ahead and conduct  an
    assessment of Article 8 outside the Immigration Rules and to allow  the
    appeal on that basis.

15. The Sponsor, Mr Adil, submitted that he had already  explained  to  the
    judge below that the director of AZB Castle Cars Ltd was not willing to
    assist and was not willing to provide another letter, given that he had
    already provided one, even though this letter was deficient in terms of
    details required for Appendix FM.  He said that initially his  employer
    was absolutely intransigent and would not provide any  further  letter.
    When the ECO refused the application, he then took that refusal to  the
    director and at that point the director relented  somewhat  and  issued
    him with a letter, but this was done in a perfunctory manner,  and  the
    proper details were not put  in  that  letter,  resulting  in  the  ECM
    issuing another refusal after that.  He went on to  explain  that,  "it
    has been really difficult for me to get a letter from my director".  He
    said that AZB Castle Cars Ltd did not have a HR department.   They  had
    no administrative staff.  They  only  had  a  PA  who  worked  for  the
    director and it was well outside their means to be able to  assist  any
    further than they had done.  He was in a predicament and had  done  all
    that he could.

16. In reply, Mr Singh submitted  that  the  Rules  have  simply  not  been
    complied with and the only decision that the judge could  have  arrived
    at was that of a refusal.

No Error of Law

17. I am satisfied that the making of the decision by the  judge  does  not
    involve the making of an error on a point of law (see Section 12(1)  of
    TCEA 2007) such that I should set aside the  decision  and  remake  the
    decision.  My reasons are as follows.

18.  First,  in  what  is  a   sensitive,   comprehensive,   and   thorough
    determination, the judge considers all the issues that were relevant in
    this case.  She did not overlook the importance of compliance with  the
    Immigration Rules.  In fact, she referred to the case of SS (Congo) and
    emphasised how the importance of substantive and  evidential  Rules  in
    Appendix FM and Appendix FM-SE could not be overlooked and  had  to  be
    placed equal weight (see paragraph 22).  As  she  did  not  accept  any
    suggestion that compliance was not mandatory so as to require a  letter
    being produced from the employer in the terms necessary (see  paragraph
    21).

19. Second, and in any event, what the judge did was to  allow  the  appeal
    outside the Rules, recognising that it was  a  compelling  circumstance
    that the Appellant was not in a position to reapply for entry clearance
    and produce all the specified evidence (see paragraph 28).

20. Third, as against this, full consideration was given to the application
    of Section  117B  NIAA  and  the  maintenance  of  fair  and  effective
    immigration control (paragraph 29).  It was only after  this  that  the
    conclusion was reached that "this is an exceptional  case  where  there
    are compelling circumstances sufficient to outweigh the public interest
    of maintaining the decision".

21. Fourth, this was because the Appellant met the  other  requirements  of
    Appendix FM "and has satisfied the  other  additional  requirements  of
    Appendix FM-SE" and that "it will be difficult if  not  impossible  for
    him to obtain a further  letter  from  his  employer  which  meets  the
    evidential requirements" (paragraph 30).

22. This Tribunal, having a supervisory  jurisdiction  can  only  interfere
    with  the  finding  of  fact  such  as  this,  if  it  is  in  all  the
    circumstances of the case "perverse" or "irrational".

23. I cannot find any basis for so concluding, given that  the  judge  does
    not err in any way, either factually in having regard to  every  aspect
    of the facts presented before her, or indeed in terms of law, given the
    attention given to the applicable immigration authorities in this  kind
    of situation.  Accordingly, the decision stands.

Notice of Decision

There is no material error of law in the  original  judge's  decision.   The
determination shall stand.

No anonymity direction is made.
