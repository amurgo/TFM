For the Appellant:     Ms A Weston, instructed by Tayler & Co Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Ms J Sigley, Home Office Presenting Officer



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


  1. This is an appeal against the determination of an  Adjudicator,  Mr  A
     Baker, promulgated on 24 June  2004.   He  dismissed  the  Appellant's
     appeal against the refusal by the Secretary of State of leave to enter
     and his proposal to give directions for  the  Appellant's  removal  to
     Iraq.

  2. The Appellant was born in Kuwait in 1972 to parents born in Gaza.   He
     is a Palestinian who had been habitually resident in Iraq since  1991.
     He feared for his  safety  there  after  his  brothers  had  got  into
     difficulties with Ba'ath Party members over business dealings and left
     in 1999.  He arrived in the  United  Kingdom  three  months  later  in
     September 1999, having travelled via Iran,  Thailand,  and  Laos.   He
     claimed asylum on arrival but his claim  was  not  dealt  with  until,
     after an SEF interview in June 2003, it was refused in June 2004.

  3. The Adjudicator had reservations about his  complete  truthfulness  in
     relating the difficulties which his brother  had  had  and  about  why
     asylum had not been claimed en route to the United  Kingdom.   But  he
     accepted the essence of the claim.   He  concluded  however  that  the
     change in the regime had removed the source of his  fear.   The  claim
     that  Palestinians  were  now  persecuted  in  Iraq  because  of   the
     preferential status which they had enjoyed under  Saddam  Hussein  was
     rejected, although there had been mass  evictions  from  their  homes.
     "There was no evidence of  violence  or  other  overt  discrimination"
     against them, though many had chosen to go to Jordan, like his mother.
      Conditions were not significantly worse than for many others in Iraq.
      He rejected the asylum claim.

  4. The Article 8 ECHR claim was based upon  the  relationship  which  the
     Appellant had formed in  about March 2002 with a  British  citizen  to
     whom he had become engaged in September 2003, with whom he  lived  and
     whom he was shortly due to marry.  His fianc�e was unwilling  to  move
     to Iraq because of the security situation and her lack  of  any  local
     language, or relations there.  The Secretary of State argued  that  he
     could make an application for entry clearance from Jordan.

  5. The Adjudicator said:

           "14.  The background materials shows that there are currently no
                 United  Kingdom  entry  clearance   facilities   in   Iraq.
                 Applications by Iraqi citizens and those of habitual  Iraqi
                 residence should be made via Amman in Jordan."

  6. The Adjudicator said that despite certain anxieties:

           "23.  I do still find to the appropriate level  of  proof,  that
                 family life does exist  and  that  a  return  would  indeed
                 constitute an interference with it.  I also find that  such
                 interference is in accordance with the law which does  have
                 the legitimate aim of  immigration  control.   I  therefore
                 must now turn to proportionality.


                 [His fianc�e] freely concedes that she  was  aware  of  the
                 Appellant's uncertain immigration status from very early in
                 their relationship which  developed  such  notwithstanding.
                 It is clearly a matter of her personal choice as to whether
                 she were to accompany him back to Iraq, having entered into
                 the present situation with her eyes wide open, however  her
                 concerns currently at her own personal safety in  Iraq  are
                 well understood although I  do  not  give  much  weight  in
                 context to the other  factors  she  mentions.   I  am  also
                 conscious of the particular difficulties this Appellant has
                 in light of his nationality in terms of his ability to make
                 an out-of-country application  for  entry  clearance  as  a
                 spouse.  However, I simply do not believe,  as  he  claims,
                 that if he returns to Iraq he will  effectively  thereafter
                 be 'landlocked in' forever.  I do not accept that he cannot
                 obtain replacement papers from Egypt and  indeed,  for  the
                 purposes of return from the United Kingdom would inevitably
                 be provided with travel documents to facilitate  same.   He
                 has his birth and educational certificate and his  father's
                 death certificate available, so I see  no  reason  why,  if
                 necessary, postal entry clearance facilities should not  be
                 availed of.  There may be some delay involved, but I see no
                 reason why the Appellant should be entitled to  queue  jump
                 other such applicants to enter the United Kingdom."

  7. He dismissed the human rights appeal.  We note the language  used  for
     the conclusion that family life existed.  The appropriate standard  of
     proof where no risk is being assessed is the balance  of  probability.
     Family relationships may or may not be a risk  factor  for  asylum  or
     Article 3 or 8 cases.  Some Article 8 cases  are  concerned  with  the
     risk of a breach of human rights on return.  But where  the  issue  is
     whether or not family life has been established in  this  country  for
     the purposes of seeing whether the interests  of  immigration  control
     outweigh it, the standard of proof for its establishment  is  that  of
     the  balance  of  probabilities  and  not  a  reasonable   degree   of
     likelihood, let alone, as we have sometimes seen it, a real risk  that
     someone was married.  It may mean that one  case  gives  rise  to  two
     different standards of proof for one factor depending on the issue  to
     which that factor is relevant.

  8. Ms Weston, for the Appellant,  put  her  case  to  some  extent  in  a
     different way from that set out in the grounds of appeal.  But all the
     points which she raised went only to the  human  rights  appeal;   the
     grounds had expressly disclaimed a challenge to the  asylum  decision.
     She said that the Adjudicator had ignored a short but important  piece
     of background evidence about the ease with which  a  Palestinian,  who
     was not a national of Iraq, could travel from Iraq to Jordan in  order
     to make an application for entry clearance.  This  showed  that  there
     were very real doubts about whether Jordan would let him in  for  that
     or  indeed  any  purpose.   There  was  no  evidence  to  support  the
     Adjudicator's finding that they could make such  an  application  from
     Jordan anyway.  It was for the Secretary of State  to  show  that  the
     interference with family life was justified and as part  of  his  case
     was that it was proportionate to return the Appellant because he could
     make an application for entry clearance, it was for the  Secretary  of
     State to show that he could in fact do so.

  9.  Ms  Sigley,  for  the  Secretary  of  State,   submitted   that   the
     Adjudicator's conclusions were justified on the evidence and  that  in
     fact he was right to say that non-Iraqi nationals who were  habitually
     resident in  Iraq  were  permitted  by  the  United  Kingdom  to  make
     applications for entry clearance in another country, Jordan,  as  were
     Iraqis.  Importantly, she pointed out that the Adjudicator  was  wrong
     in his apparent assumption in paragraph 23 that a  postal  application
     could be made.  That was not so.  But the onus was on the Appellant to
     show that he could not  gain  entry  to  Jordan  for  those  purposes,
     bearing in mind that the assumption behind his being back in Iraq  was
     that he would have had papers issued by the Iraqi authorities enabling
     him to return.  It would be for him to show that he could  not  obtain
     the necessary papers for such travel, if those upon which he would  be
     returned would not suffice.

 10. Ms Weston also sought to raise the delay between  the  claim  and  the
     decision, not just as a factor which told in favour of her  case,  but
     as one which of itself showed the  decision  to  be  disproportionate.
     She cited Shala v SSHD [2003] EWCA Civ  233,  [2003]  INLR  349.   The
     Appellant had a legitimate claim when he arrived and if  it  had  been
     dealt with timeously, he would have had some relief which  would  have
     meant that he could have applied in-country for entry clearance.   She
     was unable to point to any policy concerning Iraqi residents  in  1999
     or later.

 11. Ms Sigley submitted that the Shala point had not been  raised  in  any
     ground of appeal, which is true, and  that  it  had  not  been  argued
     before the Adjudicator, which is also true.  If he had  had  leave  of
     some sort at the time of the engagement he would not have  had  it  at
     the time of marriage;  the engagement occurred after the war in Iraq.

 12. We point out that that case was considered in Janjanin v  SSHD  [2004]
     EWCA Civ 448, [2004] Imm AR 264, and comments  were  made  of  general
     relevance as well as others relevant to the position of the particular
     group  of  asylum  claimants.   Shala  was  also  considered   in   DM
     (Proportionality-Article 8) Croatia CG* [2004] UKIAT 00024, [2004] Imm
     AR 211 and J (Serbia and Montenegro) 2004 [UKIAT] 00016.   There  have
     been many others as well.  Shala  should  not  be  cited  on  its  own
     without reference to the later consideration of its significance.

 13. We consider that the Adjudicator made a material  error  of  law.   He
     assumed that there was the facility for a postal application for entry
     clearance to be made through Jordan.  This  would  have  affected  his
     consideration of the travel difficulties  which  the  Appellant  might
     face in reaching Amman to make a personal  application  or  to  attend
     interview.  Ms Sigley told us and we accept, it is not disputed,  that
     as a matter of fact that is wrong.  Applications have to  be  made  in
     person or at least in such a way that an interview takes place and  so
     the ability to travel to Amman becomes critical.  This is  an  example
     of an error of fact which is an error of law.   This  point  had  been
     made clear in MN (Entry  clearance  facilities-Availability)  Iraq  CG
     [2004] UKIAT 00316, a case which concerned an Iraqi national,  decided
     after the Adjudicator's determination.

 14. The Adjudicator did not err in concluding that a Palestinian  habitual
     resident of Iraq could make a visa application through Jordan.   True,
     the source of that has not been identified but as we are accepting the
     truth of what we were told about the need for personal  attendance  at
     Amman for entry clearance, we see no reason to reject the confirmation
     which we received that such  Palestinians  could  also  apply  through
     Amman.

 15. Had the Adjudicator realised the true position  namely  that  personal
     attendance was required,  he  might  have  considered  the  background
     evidence as to the difficulties of travel for Palestinians to  Jordan.
     This, albeit brief, was contained in the June  2003  Report  from  the
     Arab Commission for Human Rights.  Only 100 or so out of  1000  or  so
     Palestinians who had  sought  entry  to  Jordan  from  Iraq  had  been
     permitted to enter and the rest were in a camp in the  open  near  the
     border.  It also said that Palestinians were only  allowed  to  travel
     once a year, which was relic of the former regime's rules.  We do  not
     consider that the failure to refer to this can of itself constitute an
     error of law;  there is no evidence that the Adjudicator was  referred
     to this short passage in 130  pages  of  background  material,  almost
     entirely directed to other issues.  It is not an error of law  for  an
     Adjudicator not to spot something in such a bundle.   It  is  for  the
     parties to put forward what they rely on and wish  to  be  taken  into
     account with some particularity and why:  they cannot do  so  just  by
     submitting a large bundle.

 16. The Adjudicator had no evidence before him as to the  documents  which
     the Appellant might have when he returned to Iraq.  He appears to have
     assumed that the papers upon which he might return would enable him to
     leave Iraq for the purposes of the application for entry clearance and
     then to return to await the result.  This would be  another  error  of
     fact which is an error of law.  The position for  Iraqi  nationals  is
     clear from MN above.   They can be issued in Iraq with Interim  Travel
     Documents or with a passport which will be valid for travel to Jordan,
     which does not require a visa for Iraqis.  But those documents are not
     issued in the United Kingdom because there is at present  no  consular
     facility.  It follows that the return  of  an  otherwise  undocumented
     Iraqi is based upon a one way travel document;  a Palestinian will not
     be in a better position.  Therefore the document will not suffice  for
     onward travel to Jordan for the purposes of making a visa application.
      The background material, limited as it is, suggests that  Palestinian
     habitual residents are restricted in their travel  potential  by  both
     Iraq and Jordan.

 17. The alternative suggestion of obtaining Egyptian papers, even if  they
     could be obtained, is no basis for a conclusion that they would permit
     the Appellant to travel from Iraq to Jordan and back again.

 18. In view of the two errors of law, we are entitled to look at the up to
     date position before us in assessing the continuing lawfulness of  the
     decision to return the Appellant and whether it would instead  involve
     a disproportionate interference with his Article 8 rights.  He is  now
     married and his wife is expecting  a  baby  in  the  not  too  distant
     future.  So the degree of interference would be that much greater than
     considered by either the Secretary of State or the Adjudicator.

 19.  We  also  need  to  consider  what  the  evidence  shows  about   the
     practicability of actually making an application for entry  clearance.
     We emphasise that point, because the  aspect  of  immigration  control
     with which the Adjudicator was concerned was not that the  application
     would lack merit, but that the Appellant should not jump the queue for
     entry clearance.  In effect, that would show that the system for entry
     clearance need not be applied if someone arrived in the United Kingdom
     and then made a human rights appeal against  his  removal  when  there
     were Immigration Rules which governed  his  case.   However,  such  an
     approach does assume that the Appellant can at least apply to join the
     queue by making an application.   The  assessment  of  proportionality
     under Article 8 may differ if  the  removal  prevents  an  application
     being made.  The queue jumping point then becomes entirely misleading.
      So there are two factors for us to consider which were not dealt with
     by the Adjudicator, both of which assist the Appellant.

 20. Ms Sigley endeavoured to deal with the second point as to the  ability
     of the Appellant to travel to Amman by  reference  to  the  burden  of
     proof which she said lay upon him to make out his  case.   We  do  not
     accept the way she put it.  We accept that it is for the Appellant  to
     show that Article 8 is engaged and that the action of the Secretary of
     State would interfere with it.  The Secretary of State then shows that
     the interference is lawful and is in pursuance  of  the  interests  of
     immigration control.  It is then for the Appellant to  show  that  the
     interference is disproportionate to that interest.

 21. But where the point at issue is one which goes to the extent or nature
     of the public interest involved in immigration control, it is for  the
     Secretary of State to make out his point.   It  is  the  Secretary  of
     State's contention that the interests of  the  system  of  immigration
     control require this man to make an application for entry clearance in
     his country of  habitual  residence  and  to  return  there  for  that
     purpose.  It  is  implicit  at  least  in  that  contention  that  the
     Secretary of State contends that the FCO  provides  the  facility  and
     that the Appellant would not be prevented by the authorities  of  Iraq
     or Jordan from applying.  It is for  him  to  make  out  his  implicit
     contention rather than for the Appellant to show the contrary.  On the
     material before  us,  there  is  no  basis  for  concluding  that  the
     Appellant would ever actually be able  to  make  the  application  for
     entry clearance.  This conclusion on the state of the evidence  before
     us does not preclude a different decision on the  basis  of  different
     evidence.

 22. This is not to say that the Secretary of State will  always  bear  the
     burden of proof on a point of  practicability.   If,  for  example,  a
     claimant says that  the  impediment  to  an  application  is  his  own
     unwillingness or inability to travel for personal reasons eg  fear  of
     flying or cost of travel, it will be for the claimant to make out  his
     contention, and its significance.

 23. It does not inevitably follow from the fact  that  the  making  of  an
     entry clearance application may well not be a practicable proposition,
     that it is disproportionate to return someone.  It is a  factor  which
     goes into the balance.  But, the force of  the  relevant  interest  of
     immigration control  in  an  orderly  system  of  entry  clearance  is
     weakened where no application for entry can practicably be made, in  a
     category of case contemplated by the Immigration  Rules.   Its  effect
     depends on the interests which are interfered with by removal.  Family
     life involving a young child is a very important point, as is the fact
     that the application, if made, would fall within a category recognised
     by the Rules.  We are not directly concerned with the  merits  because
     that would be for entry clearance but it is relevant that  no  grounds
     are put forward which suggest that a  marriage  application  would  be
     unsuccessful.  So the interest  in  removing  someone  who  could  not
     practically make an application for entry clearance, which,  if  made,
     could well succeed, has to be quite strong where the failure to follow
     proper procedures, rather than a substantive point, is the immigration
     control interest relied on to support  the  interference  with  family
     life.

 24. If entry clearance was not likely on its merits, we would  regard  any
     impracticability in the making  of  such  an  application  in  a  very
     different light.  It would be perverse in general to regard that as  a
     reason for not insisting  on  the  maintenance  of  the  substance  of
     immigration control.

 25. In view of our conclusion  that  the  Adjudicator  has  made  material
     errors of law and in view of the additional material which we have and
     the change of circumstances, we now have to make up our own  minds  as
     to the lawfulness, the proportionality, of return.  We accept that the
     wife entered into the marriage with her eyes open, and then  conceived
     when her husband's position was yet more precarious.   The  engagement
     preceded the Secretary of State's decision but came after the invasion
     of Iraq and the removal of Saddam Hussein, which would clearly  put  a
     different complexion on the asylum claim as its failure now shows.  We
     agree with the Adjudicator that it is only the security  situation  in
     Iraq which is significant in preventing the wife going there.  All the
     other factors, language, family and  social  conditions  were  factors
     which represent the consequences  of  her  choice  of  husband.   They
     cannot impose their choice of residence upon the  United  Kingdom  for
     those reasons.  However, they are now married;  the wife is  pregnant,
     and there is an established close family life.

 26. We recognise the delays in the Secretary of  State's  decision  making
     process and the common consequence that young people will form serious
     relationships which may become marriages.  That is a  relevant  factor
     even without the special factors of the Shala case.  We do not  regard
     this case as equivalent to Shala on the material  we  have  about  the
     grant of leave to those leaving Iraq.  If there had been  a  grant  of
     leave to remain of some sort in 1999  or  2000,  it  might  well  have
     expired even before the engagement and we are not prepared  to  assume
     that it would have been long enough to permit an  in-country  marriage
     application.

 27. We accept on the evidence that the Appellant is unlikely to be able to
     make an application for entry clearance for an indefinite period, with
     the result that there would be a long term  or  permanent  rupture  in
     both the marriage and in the relationship with his child-to-be.   This
     is not a case where the wife could be expected to go with the  husband
     of her choosing, because of  the  security  situation  which  is  very
     difficult, and the more so for a Palestinian with no nationality.  The
     interference would be  very  substantial,  potentially  permanent  and
     wholly destructive of the relationship with  wife  and  child  to  be.
     Such a relationship, though begun  when  the  Appellant's  status  was
     uncertain and strengthened as it became more precarious, was a  likely
     accompaniment to the Secretary of State's delays.

 28. This substantial and destructive interference  would  not  be  imposed
     because the Appellant's case to live here with his wife  lacked  merit
     under the Immigration Rules but because he was not complying with  the
     perfectly proper procedure  requirements.   It  is  wholly  reasonable
     generally to return people for that procedural reason.   But  this  is
     very different.  The Appellant arrived with a legitimate asylum claim,
     as the Adjudicator found it then was.  He then formed  a  relationship
     in a very prolonged period of delay in Secretary  of  State  decision-
     making.  That relationship is now  the  basic  unit  of  family  life,
     husband and wife, with a child an imminent addition.  His application,
     if he could make it, would have good prospects.  If  returned  because
     the marriage application should be made and considered out-of-country,
     he could not comply with the procedures, for reasons  entirely  beyond
     his control and due to the  United  Kingdom's  lack  of  the  relevant
     facilities abroad.  The rupture could be very severe.  The  system  of
     control is not maintained in all these  circumstances  by  removal  to
     pursue an application which cannot be pursued.

 29. We have come to the conclusion that whether the question is whether  a
     reasonable Secretary of State could  regard  it  as  proportionate  to
     remove the Appellant on these facts, or whether this is one  of  those
