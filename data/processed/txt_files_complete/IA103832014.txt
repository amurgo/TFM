                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr R Ahmed of Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr P Armstrong, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   The Secretary of State is the appellant to  this  appeal  but  for  the
    sake of consistency I refer to her as the respondent (as she was in the
    First-tier Tribunal) and to the original appellant as such.

2.   The Secretary of State  has  appealed,  with  permission,  against  the
    First-tier Tribunal decision of Judge Camp who allowed the  appellant's
    appeal against the respondent's refusal dated 14 February 2014 to issue
    him with a residence card as the dependant extended family member of an
    EEA national under Regulation 8(2) of the Immigration (EEA) Regulations
    2006.   The  original  reasons  for  refusal  letter  stated  that  the
    appellant had not provided any evidence of his dependency  on  his  EEA
    national sponsor at any time, either in the UK or  in  another  country
    prior to his entering the UK.

3.   The  appellant's  sponsor  is  his  first  cousin,  a  citizen  of  the
    Netherlands, who is said to be exercising treaty rights in the UK.   It
    was not in issue that the appellant was dependent upon his  sponsor  in
    the UK.  The issue was whether  the  appellant  was  supported  by  the
    sponsor in Pakistan before he came to the UK as required by  Regulation
    8(2).  The judge noted that it was not suggested that the appellant had
    ever been a member of the sponsor's household while in Pakistan but the
    issue is whether he had been a dependent whilst in  that  country.   On
    that issue the judge found in favour of the appellant and  allowed  the
    appeal.

4.   In seeking permission to appeal, the  respondent  argued  that  "as  no
    documentary evidence whatsoever has been produced to support the claims
    that the sponsor supported the appellant prior to his  arrival  in  the
    UK, the appellant has failed to discharge the burden  of  proof".   The
    judge appears to have accepted the oral evidence of the sponsor and the
    appellant without more.

5.   Permission to appeal was granted on 19  September  2014  by  First-tier
    Tribunal T R P  Hollingworth.   His  reasons  for  granting  permission
    included the following:

         "The reality is there is almost no evidence of substance other than
         the appellant and the sponsor's oral testimony to verify the  issue
         of  out-of-country  dependency.   The  credibility   of   both   is
         questionable.  The determination surprisingly  does  not  make  any
         finding  on  credibility.   According  to  the  appellant,  he  was
         involved in not one, but two,  businesses  in  Pakistan.   Both  of
         which were unsuccessful.  No details of  these  are  provided,  not
         even their names, there is no proof of business capital sent by the
         sponsor.  Admittedly, this is said to be  sent  via  others.   But,
         where the funds originate in the UK is not identified.  There is no
         proof of 'poor profits', financial assistance from the sponsor, the
         ï¿½4,000 said to come  from  the  UK,  or  proof  of  'pressure  from
         lenders'."

6.   Submissions were made by both representatives on the question of  error
    of law.  Mr Armstrong  submitted,  relying  on  the  grounds,  that  no
    reasons had been given by the judge for his  findings  that  there  had
    been financial evidence of dependency in Pakistan.  The burden of proof
    was on the appellant and, in the absence of documentary  evidence,  the
    appellant had failed to discharge the burden of proof on the balance of
    probabilities.

7.   In reply, Mr Ahmed submitted  that  the  judge  had  provided  adequate
    reasons, that he was entitled to accept the evidence of the sponsor and
    the appellant and that there had been no error of law.   Mr  Armstrong,
    in responding, repeated that there was no documentary evidence whatever
    that any money had ever  been  sent  by  the  sponsor  to  support  the
    appellant in Pakistan.  No bank statements were produced  to  show  the
    withdrawal of funds nor evidence from any individual who  was  said  to
    have taken money to Pakistan on behalf of the sponsor.

8.   Having considered the submissions and reviewed all the documentary  and
    other evidence that had been before the First-tier Tribunal Judge I  am
    satisfied that the judge erred in accepting the oral  evidence  of  the
    appellant  and  the  sponsor   without   any   corroborative   evidence
    whatsoever.  His error was in failing to acknowledge that the burden of
    proof rested upon the appellant and that the nature of the claims as to
    dependency in Pakistan  was  capable,  at  least  to  some  extent,  of
    corroborative documentary proof.  Of that, there was  none  whatsoever.
    The First-tier Tribunal decision must therefore be set aside.

9.   Although I was invited to remit  the  appeal  back  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a rehearing, I  have  decided  that  there  is  more  than
    adequate evidence to enable me to remake the decision.

10.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge's decision sets  out  a  summary  of  the
    oral evidence at [8]-[12] and I have taken into account the  bundle  of
    appellant's evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal.  Although
    the Sponsor claims to have sent substantial monies to Pakistan  and  to
    have set up businesses there in order to support the  appellant,  there
    is absolutely no corroborative proof  of  any  of  those  claims.   The
    burden of proof is on the appellant (and the sponsor) but,  other  than
    their oral testimony, which must be regarded as self-serving, there  is
    no other evidence to support the claim.

11.  I therefore remake  the  decision  by  dismissing  the  appeal  of  the
    appellant Mr Tahir  on the  basis  that  I  am  not  satisfied  to  the
    required standard, that he was a dependent of  the  sponsor  whilst  in
    Pakistan.

Notice of Decision

12.  The First-tier Tribunal determination contained an  error  of  law  for
    the reasons set out above and  the  determination  is  accordingly  set
    aside.  I remake the decision by dismissing Mr Tahir's appeal.

13.  There has been no request for anonymity and no such direction is made.
