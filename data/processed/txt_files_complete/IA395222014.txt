Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms Rogers, Immigration Advice Centre Limited
For the Respondent:    Ms Rackstraw, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

    1. The Appellant is a citizen of Liberia and of France, born on 3  April
       1982.

    2. The Appellant says that she entered the UK on 25 January  2003  using
       her French passport to do so, and that she has  remained  in  the  UK
       ever since.

    3. The date the Appellant's husband, Mr Abdul-Kader Dem, entered the  UK
       is unknown, but on 30 December 2002  he  claimed  asylum,  which  was
       refused. On 17 February 2007 he applied for a  residence  card  which
       was issued to him on 10 December 2007, valid for five  years.  On  25
       June 2009 he applied again for a residence card which was  issued  to
       him on 29 June 2009, valid for  five  years.  An  application  for  a
       travel document that he made on 24 July 2009 was refused on 12 August
       2009.

    4. The Appellant applied for a document certifying a right of  permanent
       residence on 23 May 2013, but this was refused on 22 October 2013. It
       is accepted before me that there was no appeal against that decision.
       On instructions Ms Rogers was able to say that the Appellant believed
       she had been misled by her previous advisers as to whether any appeal
       had been lodged by them against this decision. It was said to be  the
       discovery of her true position  that  led  to  her  making  a  second
       application of that type on 27 August 2014, which was in turn refused
       on 18 September 2014. The Appellant appealed that  refusal  decision,
       and her appeal was heard and allowed by Immigration Judge Birkby in a
       decision promulgated on 8 January 2015.

    5. The Respondent sought permission to appeal that decision to the Upper
       Tribunal which was granted by the  First  Tier  Tribunal  by  way  of
       decision of Judge Hollingworth of 19 February  2015.  The  Judge  had
       arguably failed to demonstrate that he had applied regulation 6(7) to
       the chronology given by the Appellant, and he had arguably  erred  in
       finding that just because JSA had been paid to her by  the  DWP  this
       meant that  she  was  a  "jobseeker"  for  the  purpose  of  the  EEA
       Regulations in any relevant period.

    6. The Appellant served a Rule 24 response to the grounds of appeal on 1
       April 2015 in which she asserted that the "compelling evidence"  test
       formed no part of the EEA Regulations at the material time,  and  was
       thus irrelevant to her circumstances.

    7. Thus the matter comes before me.

  Regulation 15

    8. The Appellant relied upon regulation 15(a) of the EEA Regulations  in
       her assertion that she had qualified for a right to reside in the  UK
       permanently,  and  asserted  that  she  had  resided  in  the  UK  in
       accordance with the regulations  for  a  continuous  period  of  five
       years. It was therefore her case  that  she  had  been  a  "qualified
       person" under regulation 6 for the requisite period of time,  and  it
       was argued before the Judge that she had accrued the  necessary  five
       year period by December 2008.

    9. The evidence placed before the Tribunal did not explain  the  reasons
       for the refusal of the Appellant's May 2013 application. Nor  did  it
       explain the basis upon which her husband had made his application  in
       either 2007 or 2009 for a residence card. Those decisions  do  rather
       beg the question of whether the Respondent accepted in 2007 and  2009
       that the Appellant was then a "qualified person"  and  thus  able  to
       sponsor her husband's application.

  Regulation 6

   10. Regulation 6(7) to the EEA Regulations in their current form provides
       that;

           'A person may not retain the status  of  a  worker  pursuant  to
           paragraph 2(b), or jobseeker pursuant  to  paragraph  1(a),  for
           longer than six months unless he can provide compelling evidence
           that he is continuing to  seek  employment  and  has  a  genuine
           chance of being engaged'

   11. On the Appellant's own case  she  was  unemployed  and  claiming  job
       seekers allowance between January 2004 and May 2005 (15  months)  and
       again between February 2007 and October 2007  (8  months)  and  again
       between April 2009 and  June  2010  (14  months)  and  again  between
       December 2011 and August 2012 (8 months). There  were  other  shorter
       periods too, but they did not pass the critical six  month  threshold
       of regulation  6(7).  Accordingly,  as  the  Appellant  concedes,  if
       regulation 6(7) applied to her, then as at the date  of  the  hearing
       she had failed to demonstrate  that  she  had  accrued  a  continuous
       period of five years employment unbroken by periods of unemployment.

   12. Whilst the Appellant accepts that regulation 6(7) was in force at the
       date that she made her application on 27 August 2014, and at the date
       of the hearing before the Tribunal, she argues in her Rule 24  Notice
       that regulation 6(7) was not in force throughout the period  of  five
       years  that  she  relies  upon,  and  thus  argues  that  it  has  no
       application to her. Regulation 6(4-7) was introduced in place of  the
       preceding regulation 6(4) with effect from  1  January  2014  by  the
       Immigration (European Economic Area) (Amendment) (No  2)  Regulations
       2013/3032; paragraph 2(1) and Schedule 1 paragraph 3  (e).  According
       to paragraph 6 thereof, transitional provisions are  as  set  out  in
       Schedule 3 thereto. Schedule 3 paragraph 1 reads as follows;

           'For the purposes of paragraph 3(b) to (e) of Schedule 1 -

                 a) any period of employment in the  UK  before  the  coming
                    into force of these regulations is to be  treated  as  a
                    period of employment under  regulation  6  of  the  2006
                    regulations as amended by these regulations; and

                 b) any period -

                     i) of duly recorded involuntary unemployment; or

                    ii) during which a  person  was  a  jobseeker  for  the
                        purposes  of  regulation  6(1)(a)   of   the   2006
                        regulations,

                    before the coming into force of these regulations is  to
                    be disregarded'

   13. When the appeal was called on for  hearing  before  me  Ms  Rackstraw
       acknowledged that she had failed to  appreciate  the  nature  of  the
       argument that  was  raised  in  the  Rule  24  Notice,  and  had  not
       considered the effect of 2013/3032. I stood the appeal down in  order
       that she might do so.

  The resumed hearing

   14. When the hearing resumed Ms Rogers clarified that she argued that the
       Appellant  had  demonstrated  that  she  met  the   requirements   of
       regulation 6(2)(b)(iii) by December 2008.  Thus  simply  because  the
       Appellant was no longer working at  any  given  date,  and  had  been
       unemployed for an interval of greater than six months  in  the  2003-
       2008 period, she should not cease to be treated as a worker (and thus
       a qualified person) if she could provide evidence  that  was  seeking
       employment and had a genuine  chance  of  being  engaged.  Ms  Rogers
       argued that this was precisely the test that the  DWP  employed  when
       ascertaining whether the Appellant should receive JSA,  and  that  it
       would be perverse for the Respondent to refuse to  accept  the  DWP's
       judgement on such an issue.   , even though the residence card issued
       to her in 2007 would have remained valid at that date. Nonetheless it
       is common ground before me that the Judge's starting  point  in  this
       appeal should have been that the Appellant had  demonstrated  to  the
       Respondent's satisfaction in both December 2007  and  again  in  June
       2009 that she was then a "qualified person".  If  she  did  not  then
       enjoy that status, then no residence card would have been  issued  to
       her. Since the Respondent did not assert  that  there  had  been  any
       deception in the course of those applications, it was not appropriate
       for the Respondent to take any other  stance.  An  analogy  could  be
       drawn with the guidance of the Upper Tribunal  in  Ewulo  (effect  of
       family permit - OFM) [2012] UKUT 238 as to how past decisions of  the
       Respondent should be treated.

   15. For the Respondent Ms Rackstraw argued that the requisite  five  year
       period could only start to run in the Appellant's favour after  April
       2003 when she had claimed to have  commenced  employment.  Since  the
       Judge did not have evidence before him that  directly  addressed  the
       issue of whether she was actively seeking work for which  she  had  a
       genuine chance of being engaged in the  period  February  to  October
       2007 the Appellant had failed to demonstrate the requisite five  year
       period, because its continuity was terminated in February  2007.  She
       could not add together two  periods  of  employment  separated  by  a
       period of more than six months unemployment, in order to  demonstrate
       the requisite five year period, at any time.

  Error of Law?

   16. The first ground of challenge relied upon by the Respondent refers to
       the EEA Regulations as amended by 2013/3032, and complains  that  the
       Appellant could not meet the requirements of regulation 6(7). As such
       this takes no account of the transitional provisions to be  found  in
       Schedule 1 thereto, and  it  is  in  my  judgement  misconceived.  Ms
       Rackstraw did not seek to persuade me to the contrary.

   17. The second ground of challenge complained that there  was  no  direct
       evidence placed before the Judge to show that during  any  period  of
       unemployment the Appellant was actively seeking work  for  which  she
       stood a genuine chance of being engaged. Again, in my judgement, this
       challenge is misconceived. There was evidence before the Tribunal  to
       the effect that this was the situation. It  was  in  two  forms;  the
       Appellant's  own  evidence  to  that  effect,  and,  the  documentary
       evidence that indicated that the DWP had accepted that this  was  the
       case at the time.  The  Respondent  placed  no  evidence  before  the
       Tribunal to rebut the evidence relied upon by the  Appellant,  or  to
       indicate that she had misled the DWP, or to establish  that  the  DWP
       had been mistaken in its contemporaneous assessment of the situation.

   18. In the circumstances there was no error of law in the  approach  that
       the Judge took to the evidence. He was entitled to  conclude  on  the
       balance of probabilities, as he did, that the DWP  had  accepted  the
       Appellant as a jobseeker in the period February to October 2007,  and
       that the DWP had as a result made payment to her of JSA, during  that
       period. He  was  entitled  to  conclude  that  the  Appellant  was  a
       "qualified person" for the whole of the five  year  period  prior  to
       December 2008.  It follows that the Judge  was  correct  to  conclude
       that the Appellant had demonstrated  that  the  requisite  five  year
       period was made out, and that it was made out by the end of  December
       2008 [21].

Decision


  The decision promulgated on 8 January 2015 did not involve the making  of
  an error of law in the approach taken by the Judge to the evidence relied
  upon by the Appellant sufficient to require the decision upon the  appeal
  to be set aside and remade, and that decision is accordingly confirmed.

Direction regarding anonymity - Rule 14 Tribunal Procedure (Upper  Tribunal)
Rules 2008

  No anonymity direction is required, or  was  sought  in  the  First  Tier
  Tribunal. I decline to make such a direction of my own motion since there
  would appear to be no need for one, and it would serve no useful purpose.
