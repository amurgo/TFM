Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr D Balroop, counsel instructed by PGA Sols
For the Respondent:    Ms J Isherwood, Home Office Presenting Officer
                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal by a citizen of Sri Lanka against the decision of the
    First-tier Tribunal dismissing his appeal against the decision  of  the
    Secretary of State refusing him an EEA Residence Card.  The appeal  was
    heard with that of another appellant whose appeal was allowed but  this
    appeal was dismissed because the judge believed that he  did  not  have
    jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.  That was  an  entirely  sensible
    view to take at the time but we now know it was a wrong view because of
    the decision of the Court of Appeal in Khan  v  SSHD  [2017]  EWCA  Civ
    1755.

 2. Very often in cases of this kind the proper thing to do  is  simply  to
    overrule the decision of the First-tier  Tribunal,  set  it  aside  and
    order the case be heard again in the First-tier.

 3. However on this occasion there is  a  substantial  bundle  of  evidence
    indicating at a superficial reading that the application of the  appeal
    ought to succeed on its merits.

 4. Ms Isherwood  had  been  able  to  consider  the  documentary  evidence
    provided including evidence that the appellant is in fact now  lawfully
    married.  He relies on an extract of the register of marriages from the
    Famous Blacksmiths Shop in Gretna Green which,  although  novel  in  my
    experience, is an entirely legitimate place to marry and it is  plainly
    a lawful certificate.  The appellant is clearly a married man.

 5. Ms Isherwood recognised that the effective consequence of this is there
    was no sensible basis for resisting the  appeal  and  I  therefore  set
    aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal because of error  of  law
    and I substitute a decision allowing the appeal.




    Decision

    This appeal is allowed.
