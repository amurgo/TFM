Representation:
For the appellant:     Ms F Iveson, instructed by Visa Inn
For the respondent:    Ms Z Ahmad, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, Nzubechi Micheal Okechukwu, date of birth 24.11.85, is a
    citizen of Nigeria.

 2. This is his appeal against the decision of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Ross promulgated 14.3.16, dismissing his appeal against the decision of
    the Secretary of State, date 5.11.14, to  refuse  his  application  for
    leave to remain in the UK on grounds of private life,  though  he  also
    mentioned that he had a partner.  At the request of the appellant,  the
    Judge dealt the appeal on the papers, on 9.3.16.

 3. First-tier Tribunal Judge Hollingworth granted permission to appeal  on
    9.9.16.

 4. Thus the matter came before me on 4.10.16 as an  appeal  in  the  Upper
    Tribunal.

 5. The appellant did not attend.

Error of Law

 6. For the reasons summarised below, I found no material error of  law  in
    the making of the decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  such  as  to
    require the decision of Judge Ross to be set aside.

 7. The appellant  had  leave  as  a  Tier  4  student  until  25.8.14.  It
    transpires, however, that following revocation of his sponsor's licence
    his leave was curtailed to expire on 18.11.13, with no right of appeal.
    An extract or computer printout produced by Ms Ahmad today  shows  that
    this was actioned on 17.9.13, varying his leave to  allow  60  days  to
    find a further sponsor. The note also indicates that the appellant  had
    no known address on file, so the curtailment decision was sent  to  him
    as a PDF by email.

 8. It is not clear to me whether the First-tier Tribunal received  or  had
    access to the computer note now produced by Ms Ahmad  and  referred  to
    above, now on the court  file.  Ms  Iveson  states  that  it  was  only
    produced for the first time at the appeal hearing before  me.  However,
    as �5 of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal makes clear, the judge
    was clearly aware that it had been served by email, as  stated  on  the
    curtailment document itself.

 9. The  grounds  of  appeal  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  rely  on  Syed
    (curtailment of leave - notice) [2013] UKUT 114 (IAC) and suggest  that
    the refusal decision of the Secretary of State was  not  in  accordance
    with the law, because the appellant did  not  receive  the  curtailment
    decision and thus it was not effective.

10. If that is correct, then the appellant's leave did not expire until the
    original  date  of  25.8.14.  However,  he  never  made   any   further
    application for leave to remain as a Tier 4 student, in or out of time.



11. The grounds are discursive and far from clear. However,  the  appellant
    claims that his application, which is dated 21.8.14 but not received by
    the Home Office until 25.8.14, was for  leave  to  remain  outside  the
    Rules, exceptionally, on  the  basis  of  the  circumstances  he  found
    himself in following the closure of his previous  Tier  4  sponsor.  He
    claims that had he received the curtailment  decision,  he  would  have
    made an in-time application for further leave to remain and  would  not
    have had to make his subsequent application for  leave  to  remain  for
    reasons outside the Rules, which was submitted more than 28 days  after
    his leave had expired in November 2013. Ms  Iveson  makes  the  further
    assertion on the appellant's behalf that the appellant had found a Tier
    4 college willing to sponsor him, but it would not do so until he had a
    curtailment decision, and thus he has been disadvantaged by the actions
    of the Secretary  of  State  in  failing  to  ensure  he  received  the
    curtailment decision.

12. As I discovered by an examination of the case file, the facts  are  not
    quite as the appellant now alleges. The grounds of appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal, stamped as received on 20.11.14, were  considered  by  a
    judge in advance of an appeal hearing.

13. The substantive appeal hearing in the First-tier  Tribunal  was  listed
    for hearing on 1.7.15.

14. Noting that the respondent's case was that the appellant has  no  right
    of appeal, because he did not apply for leave to remain until after the
    expiry of his existing leave, which had been  curtailed  to  expire  in
    November 2013, and the appellant's assertion that he  did  not  receive
    notification of the curtailment of leave, the judge directed  that  the
    appeal be listed for a substantive hearing at which the  issue  of  the
    validity of the appeal be decided. It  was  further  directed  that  at
    least 14 days prior to the substantive  hearing  the  parties  were  to
    lodge with the Tribunal and serve on each other any evidence that  they
    seek to rely upon as to whether the appellant's  leave  was  curtailed;
    where and when the notice of curtailment was served and if there  is  a
    valid appeal.

15. There appears to have been no compliance with that direction. Ms Iveson
    was completely unaware of the directions and  in  the  absence  of  the
    appellant had no instructions on the matter.

16. What did happen was  that,  acting  on  instructions,  the  appellant's
    solicitors wrote to the Tribunal on 26.6.15 asking for the appeal to be
    decided on the papers, with no attendance  by  either  side.  That  was
    acceded to, the case taken out of the list for 1.7.15, and the  parties
    were formally notified in November 2015 that it would be dealt with  on
    the papers.

17. The letter from the appellant's representatives sought to rely  in  the
    appeal on the documentation attached to  the  letter,  effectively  the
    appeal bundle, including the witness  statement  of  the  appellant,  a
    skeleton argument and two case authorities on the Chikwamba  principle,
    one of which was the Chikwamba case itself.

18. The skeleton argument raised three grounds of  appeal,  none  of  which
    related to the validity of appeal issue about which  the  Tribunal  had
    issued directions. In essence, the skeleton argument asserts  that  the
    appellant met paragraph 276ADE of the Immigration Rules in  respect  of
    his private life, relying on very significant obstacles to  integration
    in Nigeria. It was acknowledged that although he now had a partner,  he
    could not meet the requirements  of  Appendix  FM.  The  second  ground
    sought, in the alternative, to rely on private and family life  outside
    the Rules, pursuant to article  8  ECHR,  and  asserting  that  in  the
    refusal decision the Secretary of State failed  to  fully  address  his
    article 8 claim raised in the  covering  letter  with  the  grounds  of
    appeal. The third ground addressed section 117B of the 2002 Act and the
    public interest question. The alleged non-receipt  of  the  curtailment
    decision was mentioned only briefly as part of the chronology, at �4 of
    the skeleton argument.

19. The appellant's witness statement, dated 25.3.15 explained that he  was
    aware that his college closed down when  its  licence  was  revoked  in
    November 2013. He went looking for another Tier 4 sponsor, but  as  the
    term had already started, he was told the next admission would  be  for
    the academic year starting in  September  2014.  He  approached  London
    School of Law in July 2014, only to discover that his English  language
    certificate was no longer acceptable and that he  would  have  to  take
    another English language test. He then found that he was not allowed to
    take an English language test without his passport, but, aware that his
    leave was about to expire on 25.8.14, he needed his passport  to  apply
    to the respondent to extend his leave, so could not  take  the  English
    language  test.  His  witness  statement  makes  no  mention   of   the
    curtailment decision, although  it  had  been  raised  in  the  refusal
    decision of 19.9.13.

20. It is hardly surprising that in  the  light  of  these  facts  and  the
    background as summarised above, Judge Ross, dealing with  the  case  on
    the papers, and the appellant having failed to submit any  evidence  on
    the issue, found against him on the issue of the curtailment of  leave.
    In reaching this conclusion the judge  noted  that  the  appellant  was
    aware that his college had closed in November 2013 as its  licence  had
    been revoked. I note from his application made in August 2014 that  the
    email  address  he  gave  is  the  same  email  address  to  which  the
    curtailment decision was sent: [~]@YAHOO.COM. I might add  that  it  is
    the duty of the appellant to keep  the  Home  Office  informed  of  any
    change of circumstances, including change of address.

21. The appellant's application made in August 2014 did  not  disclose  any
    substantive detail of the claimed partner, though she is  mentioned  in
    the covering letter. It is not surprising therefore that the  Secretary
    of State found insufficient evidence that the appellant met any of  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules and no  compelling
    circumstances to justify granting leave to remain outside the Rules  on
    the basis of family life under article 8 ECHR. Both  the  Secretary  of
    State's refusal decision and the decision of  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    adequately dealt with both private and family life, the judge  finding,
    pursuant to  SS  (Congo)  no  compelling  circumstances  insufficiently
    recognised under the Rules to justify granting leave to remain  outside
    the Rules under article 8 ECHR, on the  basis  that  the  decision  was
    unjustifiably harsh. There does not in fact appear to  be  any  removal
    decision so article 8 issues might well be considered premature.

22. In the light of the above, the dismissal of the appellant's appeal  was
    inevitable.

23. In granting permission to  appeal,  Judge  Hollingworth  considered  it
    arguable that the First-tier Tribunal Judge should have dealt with  the
    validity of the appeal as a preliminary issue and that  the  extent  of
    the evidence available to the judge was insufficient as the  foundation
    for such an exercise. However, given  the  appellant's  appeal  bundle,
    including witness statement and skeleton argument failed to  deal  with
    the issue at all, despite directions to do so, it  is  inevitable  that
    the issue would be resolved against the appellant.



Conclusion:

24. For the reasons set out above, I find that the making of  the  decision
    of the First-tier Tribunal did not involve the making of an error on  a
    point of law such that the decision should be set aside.

     I do not set aside the decision.

                    The decision of the First-tier Tribunal stands  and  the
                    appeal remains dismissed.

Anonymity

I have  considered  whether  any  parties  require  the  protection  of  any
anonymity direction. No submissions were made on the issue.  The  First-tier
Tribunal did  not  make  an  order.  Given  the  circumstances,  I  make  no
anonymity order.



Fee Award         Note: this is not part of the determination.

I have considered whether to make a fee award.

I have had regard to the Joint Presidential Guidance  Note:  Fee  Awards  in
Immigration Appeals (December 2011).

I make no fee award.

Reasons: The appeal has been dismissed and thus there can be no fee award.
