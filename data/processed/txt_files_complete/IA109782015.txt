                            DECISION AND REASONS


Introduction and Background

 1. The Appellant appeals against the decision of Judge Fox of  the  First-
    tier Tribunal (the FTT) promulgated on 22nd October 2015.

 2. The Appellant is an Indian national  born  on  20th  October  1983  who
    applied for leave to remain in the United Kingdom as a Tier 1 (General)
    Migrant under the Points Based System.

 3. The application was  refused  on  6th  March  2015  with  reference  to
    paragraph 322(1A) and (2) of the  Immigration  Rules.   The  Respondent
    contended that when the Appellant had applied for leave  to  remain  he
    had claimed points under Appendix A of the Immigration Rules for having
    previous earnings of ï¿½4,986.42 from employment with Accountax Solutions
    and submitted wage slips in support.

 4. The Respondent  pointed  out  that  during  a  prosecution  of  various
    individuals at Harrow Crown Court (not  including  the  Appellant)  the
    evidence of the genuineness of Accountax Solutions was tested,  and  it
    was found that the company existed with no genuine trading presence and
    was founded solely for the  purpose  of  providing  false  evidence  of
    earnings.  Therefore the Appellant had used  false  representations  in
    claiming to have earnings  from  that  company.   In  addition  it  was
    contended that the Appellant had used  false  representations  for  the
    purpose of obtaining a previous variation of leave.

 5. The appeal was heard on 30th September 2015.   There  were  two  issues
    before the FTT, one related to the refusal under the Immigration Rules,
    and the other related to Article 8 of the 1950 European  Convention  on
    Human Rights (the 1950 Convention).  The FTT decision records that  the
    parties agreed that the first  issue  of  false  representations  would
    proceed by way of submissions only, and evidence would  be  heard  from
    the Appellant and his wife in relation to Article 8.

 6. The FTT found that the Respondent had discharged the burden of proof in
    relation to the issue of false  representations,  and  the  appellant's
    account was found to be incredible.  The appeal was dismissed under the
    Immigration Rules.

 7. The FTT,  when  considering  Article  8,  found  that  the  Appellant's
    credibility had been damaged because of the findings made  against  him
    in relation to the issue  of  false  representations,  and  found  that
    family life did not exist between the Appellant and his wife.  Even  if
    family life did exist, the FTT found that it would be proportionate for
    the Appellant to leave the United Kingdom and make an  entry  clearance
    application from India.  The Article 8 aspect of the  appeal  was  also
    dismissed.

 8. The Appellant applied for permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal
    relying upon two grounds which may be summarised as follows.

 9. Firstly in relation to the Immigration Rules it was contended that  the
    FTT had erred by failing to make  sustainable  findings  with  adequate
    reasons.  It was contended that the FTT had  failed  to  set  out  what
    evidence justified the  finding  that  the  Appellant  had  made  false
    representations or used deception.   The  FTT  relied  upon  sentencing
    remarks made by His Honour Judge  Barklam  dated  19th  June  2014  who
    referred to the profile of an individual who would be engaged with  the
    fraudulent  company.   It  was  contended  that  the  FTT  had   placed
    disproportionate  weight  on  the  profile  remarks.   It  was  further
    contended that the  FTT  had  failed  to  adequately  explain  why  the
    Appellant was linked to the convictions relied on by the Respondent  or
    how the activities of Accountax impacted  on  the  Appellant.   It  was
    submitted that the FTT had not explained how there was a  link  between
    the activities of the individuals who had been  convicted  following  a
    Crown Court trial, and who were referred to in the sentencing  remarks,
    and the Appellant.

10. The second ground of appeal submitted that the FTT erred in considering
    Article 8.  The FTT had failed to take into account that the  Appellant
    had acquired more than ten years' lawful residence.  The FTT  erred  by
    relying upon the flawed credibility findings made in  relation  to  the
    issue  of  false  representations.   The  FTT  also  unreasonably  made
    findings that the Appellant's wife knew  of  his  fraudulent  activity,
    when there was no evidence to substantiate such a finding.

11. Permission to appeal was granted by Judge Brunnen of  the  FTT  in  the
    following terms;

         "2.  The grounds on which permission to  appeal  is  sought  submit
             that the judge erred in law in that he failed to give adequate
             reasons for his findings on the issue of the Appellant  making
             false representations and being involved in criminal activity.
              This ground is arguable.

         3.   The grounds submit that the judge erred in law in  considering
             the appeal under Article 8 in that his consideration of it was
             influenced by his findings on the other issue.  This  is  also
             arguable."

12. Following the grant of permission  the  Respondent  lodged  a  response
    pursuant to Rule 24 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008.  In brief summary it was contended  that  the  FTT  had  made  no
    material error of law.  It was contended that detailed and  sustainable
    reasons for findings had been given  and  the  grounds  amounted  to  a
    disagreement with the findings that had been  made,  but  disclosed  no
    error of law.

13. Directions were subsequently  issued  that  there  should  be  an  oral
    hearing before the Upper Tribunal to  ascertain  whether  the  FTT  had
    erred in law such that the decision must be set aside.

The Appellant's Oral Submissions

14. Mr Hawkin adopted the grounds  contained  within  the  application  for
    permission to appeal, and submitted that the FTT decision is  seriously
    flawed.

15. I was asked to note that the Respondent's refusal  decision  gave  only
    one reason for a refusal of the application, that being that  Accountax
    Solutions had been found in the course of a Crown Court trial  to  have
    no genuine trading presence,  and  had  been  founded  solely  for  the
    purpose of providing false evidence of earnings.  Mr  Hawkin  submitted
    that the FTT had made no finding on this central issue.  I was asked to
    note that it was common ground  that  the  Appellant  had  not  been  a
    defendant in the Crown Court trial, and he had never been questioned by
    the police or the  Respondent,  in  relation  to  his  employment  with
    Accountax Solutions.

16. I was referred to the prosecution opening note which had been  prepared
    for  the  Crown  Court  trial,  and  which  is  contained  within   the
    Respondent's supplementary bundle.  At paragraph 168,  the  prosecution
    accepted that there was payment to Accountax for  genuine  work.   This
    therefore conflicted with the stance taken by  the  Respondent  in  the
    refusal letter.  In addition the judge's sentencing remarks at  page  5
    paragraph (d) indicated that "there  was  a  huge  volume  of  business
    undertaken by these companies which was entirely legitimate."

17. There was therefore a conflict between findings made in the Crown Court
    trial, which indicated that Accountax did  have  some  genuine  trading
    activity, and the contention by the  Respondent  in  the  refusal  that
    there was no genuine trading presence.  Mr Hawkin  submitted  that  the
    FTT had erred by failing  to  make  findings  on  this  issue  and  had
    therefore failed to deal with the central issue in the appeal.

18. It was further submitted that findings made by the FTT at paragraphs 40-
    44 related to issues that did not form part of  the  case  against  the
    Appellant.  I was asked to note that the parties had  agreed  that  the
    issue of false representations would be dealt with by submissions only,
    but the FTT had then proceeded to make findings on issues that had  not
    been raised by the Respondent.

19. With reference to paragraph 47 of the FTT decision Mr Hawkin  submitted
    that the FTT had not explained how the Appellant's profile fitted  with
    the profile referred to by the sentencing judge at page 1 paragraph (f)
    of the sentencing remarks.

20. With reference to Article 8 Mr Hawkin submitted that the  FTT  had  not
    taken into  account  that  the  Appellant  had  more  than  ten  years'
    continuous lawful residence.  The FTT had speculated at paragraph 57 in
    finding that the Appellant's wife  would  be  aware  that  he  had  not
    engaged in legitimate employment with Accountax Solutions.  The FTT had
    also erred by  basing  Article  8  findings,  upon  flawed  credibility
    findings made in relation to the issue of false representations.

The Respondent's Oral Submissions

21. Mr Tarlow relied upon the Rule 24 response  in  its  entirety.   I  was
    asked to find that the FTT had made findings which were  open  to  make
    and based upon the evidence that had been provided.   For  example,  at
    paragraphs 44-45, the FTT was entitled to find that it was unusual,  if
    the Appellant had genuine employment, that he should have resigned from
    such lucrative employment.

22. Mr Tarlow submitted that taken as a whole, the decision of the  FTT  in
    relation to the Immigration Rules and Article 8, is sustainable.

The Appellant's Response

23. Mr Hawkin submitted that because it had been agreed that the  issue  of
    false representations would be dealt with by oral submissions, the  FTT
    had acted unfairly by considering and making findings  on  matters  not
    raised by the Respondent in the refusal decision.

24. At the conclusion of oral submissions I reserved my decision.

My Conclusions and Reasons

25. The principal challenge to the FTT decision relates  to  inadequacy  of
    reasoning therefore for ease of reference I set out below the  headnote
    to Budhathoki (reasons for decisions) [2014] UKUT 00341 (IAC);

         It is generally unnecessary and unhelpful for  First-tier  Tribunal
         judgments to rehearse every detail or issue raised in a case.  This
         leads to judgments becoming overly long and confused and is  not  a
         proportionate  approach  to  deciding  cases.   It   is,   however,
         necessary for judges to identify and resolve key conflicts  in  the
         evidence and explain in clear and brief  terms  their  reasons,  so
         that the parties can understand why they have won or lost.

26. I therefore apply the principles set out above  when  considering  this
    decision.

27. I do not agree with the oral submission made on the Appellant's behalf,
    that the FTT made no findings at all regarding Accountax Solutions, and
    the Respondent's contention that there was no genuine trading presence.
     The FTT set out at paragraph 50 that it  was  acknowledged  that  huge
    volumes of business were undertaken  in  a  legitimate  manner  by  the
    company.  The FTT found, however that the Appellant  did  not  fall  in
    that category.

28. Therefore the FTT did not agree with the Respondent's contention in the
    refusal decision, that Accountax had no genuine trading presence, which
    was the sole reason given  by  the  Respondent  for  finding  that  the
    Appellant had made false representations and used deception.

29. The FTT nevertheless found that the  Respondent  had  been  correct  to
    refuse the application for leave to remain, and  had  proved  that  the
    Appellant had made false representations and  used  deception.   Having
    carefully analysed the evidence and the FTT decision,  I  do  not  find
    that adequate reasons have been given for this conclusion,  and  in  my
    view a reading of the decision by the Appellant would not enable him to
    understand why his appeal has been dismissed.  I reach this  conclusion
    for the following reasons.

30. In paragraphs 40-43 the FTT finds that the Appellant's wage  slips  are
    not credible and that there was no  reliable  evidence  to  demonstrate
    that the Appellant was entitled to a commission because in his  witness
    statement he had stated that he worked in an  administrative  function.
    No evidence was given by the Appellant on this issue because  this  was
    dealt with by submissions only, and  there  is  no  indication  in  the
    Respondent's refusal decision that this point had  been  taken  against
    the Appellant.   Therefore  the  FTT  had  made  findings  against  the
    Appellant on an issue not raised in the refusal,  without  hearing  any
    evidence, and had reached findings  of  incredibility,  without  giving
    adequate reasons.  I do not find that any adequate explanation has been
    given by the FTT for concluding that it was not  reasonable  to  expect
    the Appellant not to receive some element of commission.  This was  not
    an issue that appears to have been considered by either party, and  was
    not adequately considered or analysed by the FTT.  This finding, in  my
    view, is unsafe.

31. At paragraphs 44-45 the FTT finds  it  incredible  that  the  Appellant
    would have resigned from his employment, as it appeared to be the  most
    lucrative employment that he had.  Again this was not an  issue  raised
    in the  refusal,  and  no  evidence  was  heard  on  this  point.   The
    Appellant's explanation in his witness statement was that he had  taken
    employment with Accountax because the company indicated that they would
    support him in his aim of gaining an ACCA qualification.   He  resigned
    because he was subsequently told that this support would not be  given.
    This explanation has not  been  adequately  analysed,  and  sustainable
    reasons have not been given  for  finding  that  it  was  difficult  to
    understand the Appellant's decision to resign  if  his  employment  was
    genuine.

32. I find no adequate reasoning contained within paragraph 46 in  relation
    to the finding that it was not credible that the Appellant was able  to
    engage in the employment activity claimed.

33. The profile referred to in the sentencing  remarks  relates  to  highly
    qualified people engaged in unskilled work in the service sector,  such
    as jobs in supermarkets, cinemas, food  and  petrol  stations.   It  is
    correct that the appellant  did  have  employment  with  a  supermarket
    (Netto) but he also had employment with Santander Bank, therefore it is
    unsafe to  place  substantial  weight  upon  the  Appellant  fitting  a
    generalised profile, and concluding as the FTT  did  in  paragraph  47,
    that "it is more likely  than  not  that  the  Appellant  was  actively
    engaged in and  intended  to  benefit  from  the  company's  fraudulent
    activities."

34. For the reasons given above, I conclude that the FTT  materially  erred
    in law in considering the issue of false representations and deception.

35. I find that the conclusions reached by the FTT on the  issue  of  false
    representations and deception also infected consideration of Article 8.
     At paragraph 55 the FTT records that the  Appellant's  credibility  is
    damaged by reason of the findings made in  relation  to  the  issue  of
    false representations.  I accept the submission made on the Appellant's
    behalf that the FTT engaged in speculation at paragraph 57  in  finding
    that the Appellant's wife was aware that he had not engaged in  genuine
    employment activities with Accountax Solutions.  I  therefore  conclude
    the Article 8 consideration is flawed in law and  should  also  be  set
    aside.

36. When I indicated that I was reserving my decision in relation to  error
    of law Mr Hawkin submitted that if  an  error  was  found,  the  appeal
    should be remitted back to the FTT to be heard afresh.  Mr  Tarlow  was
    of the view that the appeal could be dealt with by the Upper Tribunal.

37. I have considered paragraph 7.2  of  the  Senior  President's  Practice
    Statements.  As no findings are preserved, I find it is appropriate  to
    remit the appeal back to the FTT, because of the nature and  extent  of
    judicial fact-finding that will be necessary in order for this decision
    to be re-made.

38. The appeal will be heard by the FTT, and the parties will be advised of
    the venue, time and date in due course.  The appeal is to be  heard  by
    an FTT judge other than Judge Fox.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the FTT involved the making of an error of law such that  it
is set aside.  The appeal is allowed to the extent that it  is  remitted  to
the FTT with no findings of fact preserved.

Anonymity

No anonymity order was made by the FTT and there was no application  to  the
Upper Tribunal for anonymity.  I see no need to make an anonymity order.
