                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. The appellant is a national of Bangladesh, born on 15  June  1989.  Her
    appeal against the  decision  of  the  respondent  dated  1  June  2015
    refusing her application for leave to remain in the UK on the basis  of
    her family and private life, was dismissed by First-tier Tribunal Judge
    Maka in a decision promulgated on 9 March 2016.


 2. The appellant arrived in the UK on 6 October 2008 with leave  to  enter
    as a spouse until 18 December 2010. However, it was only  on  31  March
    2015 that she made her current application for leave to remain  on  the
    basis of her family and private life.


 3. The appellant did not have any children in the UK. It was accepted that
    she was in  a  genuine  and  subsisting  relationship  with  a  British
    citizen. Although relocating  to  Bangladesh  may  cause  a  degree  of
    hardship for her British partner, there was no evidence to suggest that
    there were insurmountable obstacles in accordance with Section EX.2  of
    Appendix FM of the Imigration Rules,  preventing  her  continuing  that
    relationship in Bangladesh. Accordingly, Section EX.1(b) did not apply.


 4. Her application was also  considered  under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Immigration Rules.  The  appellant  was  a  25  year  old  national  of
    Bangladesh,  who  entered  the  UK  in  October  2008.  The  respondent
    contended that she would  be  able  to  integrate  back  into  life  in
    Bangladesh.


 5. Nor were there  any  exceptional  compelling  circumstances  warranting
    consideration of her case outside the immigration rules.


 6. At the outset of the hearing, it was agreed that the  First-tier  Judge
    should consider the appeal under  the  Rules  and  in  accordance  with
    Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention.


 7. Both the appellant and Mr Al Amin, her husband, gave evidence. This was
    a love marriage. She had not been back to Bangladesh  after  coming  to
    the UK in 2008. She married her husband in Bangladesh on 23 June  2008.
    She was granted entry clearance as the spouse of a British  citizen  on
    18 September 2008. She entered in October 2008.


 8. In her evidence she stated that she was having IVF treatment in the UK.
    When asked why she did not seek to renew her visa once it expired,  she
    stated that  her  husband  lost  his  business  and  was  mentally  and
    physically unwell. In his witness statement, her husband stated that he
    initially forgot to make the  application  for  her  further  leave  to
    remain. Afterwards his financial crisis  affected  his  personal  life.
    They were, and continue to be, worried about their  physical  condition
    as his wife is not able to give birth to a child.


 9. The appellant said that she  had  not  looked  into  IVF  treatment  in
    Bangladesh. Medical practitioners said their treatment here is  better.
    She calls family in Bangladesh sometimes but  they  were  reluctant  to
    receive any call [26]. Her husband was brought up in the UK and did not
    know Bangladesh "too much" [27].


10.  Were  she  to  return  to  Bangladesh  and  make  an  entry  clearance
    application as a spouse for settlement there  would  be  problems  with
    regard to their financial circumstances as she did not meet the  income
    threshold requirements [28].


11. Her husband gave evidence.  He went back to Bangladesh in 2008. He  had
    arrived from Bangladesh aged 6. He  was  born  on  7  March  1980.  His
    brothers and sisters live here. He  had  "long  distance  relatives  in
    Bangladesh" [30].


12. His distant relatives in Bangladesh were on his mother's  and  father's
    side. He said that if his wife were removed, he would try  to  re-apply
    to bring her back. It would be difficult to live without her [32].


13. When asked how he forgot to apply for his wife's extension  he  replied
    that he had a catering business which had been affected by  rioting  in
    Croydon. He took a loss and the stress affected him. He found out  when
    he went to the CAB five years later.


14. His annual income '... was around �1,000 net a month as he earnt  (sic)
    �1000 net' [34]. However, Mr Hossain  accepted  that  he  earned  about
    �1,000 a month. He had worked for  Harvester  and  as  a  delivery  van
    driver. His payslips were produced.


15. In his 'Findings of fact and reasons', the Judge did not  accept,  even
    making allowances for her husband's problems,  that  this  justifies  a
    five year delay in making this application. He did not accept  that  he
    had been given the full picture as to why there was such an  inordinate
    delay [39].


16.  She  has  no  children  and  did  not  satisfy  the  income  threshold
    requirements. With regard to EX.1, he did not accept that  there  would
    be insurmountable obstacles for her family life  to  continue  together
    with her husband outside the UK. He did  not  accept  that  this  would
    entail serious hardship for her or her husband [40].


17. He accepts that they  have  a  genuine  and  subsisting  marriage.  Her
    husband is a British citizen. He has however been  back  to  Bangladesh
    and indeed they went back to get married in 2008. They would  not  have
    done so unless they had support out there for  him  to  stay  and  help
    organise a difficult task such as a wedding abroad [41].


18. He did not accept that they had no family or relatives  in  Bangladesh.
    Nor did he accept that she married someone against the family's choice.
    The appellant accepted that she was in touch with her family.


19. He did not accept that either  she  or  her  husband  would  face  very
    significant  difficulties  in  continuing  family  life  together.  Her
    husband has distant relatives in Bangladesh. He was satisfied that  the
    appellant and her husband could rely on family and friends to help them
    while they established their family life in Bangladesh [41].


20. The appellant had not looked into the availability of IVF treatment  in
    Bangladesh. Even if there may be a "cost implication" that  was  not  a
    basis for her to remain here and especially since the loss of her leave
    was of her own creation and that of her husband. [43]


21. He did not find there would be any  obstacles,  let  alone  significant
    ones, in the appellant's integration into Bangladesh.  She  has  family
    and friends there and can rely on them until  she  establishes  herself
    again or her  husband  can  support  her.  She  could  find  a  job  in
    Bangladesh fitting with her needs, having gained significant  knowledge
    and skills living in the UK [44].


22. She did not satisfy the Immigration Rules, including  paragraph  276ADE
    [45]. Nor were there any compelling circumstances [46-48].


23. The Judge nonetheless considered Article 8 "for completeness" "assuming
    it applies" [49].


24. He set out the Razgar steps at [50].  He  found  that  they  enjoyed  a
    private and family life in the UK. Interference did  have  consequences
    of such gravity as to potentially engage the operation  of  Article  8.
    The interference was in accordance with the law and necessary  for  the
    purposes of immigration control.


25. He was however satisfied that the interference was proportionate in the
    circumstances. There is no general obligation on the UK  to  facilitate
    the choice of residence made by the appellant. She was aware  from  the
    beginning of her residence that it was always precarious and subject to
    her meeting legal requirements as established in law. The fact that she
    delayed considerably in regularising her stay did not alter  that  fact
    that she remained for five  years  without  leave  or  attempted  leave
    without making any application or contacting the respondent. [53]


26. The fact that she '...  may  have  difficulties  on  return,  including
    financial and English language requirements', did  not  mean  that  the
    state was obliged to accept her choice of residence [54]. He had regard
    to te decision in Agyarko [2015] EWCA Civ 440 at [33].


27. He stated that she need not stay permanently  in  Bangladesh  but  only
    until such time as her husband is able to re-apply in  order  to  bring
    her here under the Rules. Her husband accepted that  he  would  support
    her application for entry  clearance.  This  was  a  case  where  entry
    clearance serves a real purpose. There are Rules in place  setting  out
    minimum requirements which have to be met. There was no  evidence  that
    the appellant or her husband satisfied those requirements [56]. She had
    never had any intention of going back  to  Bangladesh  having  remained
    here illegally since 2010. She sought IVF treatment on  the  NHS  which
    she was not entitled to [58].


28. Judge Maka also had regard to s.117B of the 2002 Act. The appellant has
    been a burden on the  taxpayer  already.  Her  immigration  status  has
    remained precarious throughout.  She  would  remain  a  burden  on  the
    taxpayer. It was accordingly reasonable to  expect  her  to  apply  for
    entry  clearance  and  for  her  partner  to  show  he  satisfies   the
    requirements under the Rules [59].


29. Her application was dismissed under  Article  8  of  the  Human  Rights
    Convention.


30. On 11 August 2016, First-tier Tribunal Judge P J M Hollingworth granted
    the appellant permission to appeal, stating that it was  arguable  that
    an inconsistent approach was adopted to the question of the  degree  of
    difficulty which would attend the leading of family life in Bangladesh.
    It was unclear as to what extent this affected the outcome of the case,
    given the Judge's reference at [49] to not being satisfied  that  there
    was a basis for looking at the case outside the Rules.


31. It was unclear how he approached the question of the  degree  to  which
    the Rules had been fulfilled. It was unclear what relationship  such  a
    finding would have in relation to the  question  of  the  existence  or
    otherwise of very compelling circumstances to enable a consideration of
    a breach of Article 8 outside the Rules, "....or  to  what  extent  the
    juxtaposition of the fulfilment of the Rules or otherwise  set  against
    the other factors would  affect  the  outcome  of  the  proportionality
    exercise".


32. On behalf of the appellant, Mr  Hossain  referred  to  the  grounds  of
    appeal before the first-tier Tribunal. He contended that the  appellant
    satisfied all the requirements under paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the Rules.




33. At paragraph 4, it is contended that the appellant has  never  breached
    any immigration rules. (However,  the  appellant  remained  in  the  UK
    without leave for a period of five years).


34. There would be insurmountable obstacles to live and lead a family  life
    in Bangladesh. Her husband is a British citizen and settled  here.  She
    meets the relevant immigration rules  including  paragraph  276ADE(vi).
    The respondent's decision is unlawful and incompatible with her  rights
    under the Human Rights Convention.


35. He referred to the witness statement of the appellant  at  pages  15-16
    the contents of which I have already referred to. He referred  to  page
    35 of the bundle which contained a letter dated October  2009  sent  to
    the appellant to attend  the  Gynaecology  Clinic  at  the  Leatherhead
    Hospital in Surrey. There  are  various  further  letters  relating  to
    undergoing X-Rays. She has attended a fertility and gynaecology  clinic
    in November 2011. She was referred for treatment to her uterine  septum
    in  August  2010.  There  are  further  letters   from   a   consultant
    gynaecologist dated 30 December 2010. It is noted the referring  letter
    that a sperm test for her husband has been very  poor.  He  is  in  the
    process of repeating the sperm test.


36. In January 2012 an appointment was organised  for  her  to  attend  the
    Fertility and Gynaecology Clinic. That was changed to May  2012.  There
    has been no further letter or document relied on by  the  appellant  or
    her husband, between March 2012 and the end of October 2015.


37. On 16 November 2015, the appellant was invited to attend for a cervical
    screening test. That appears to be a test available to women  generally
    between the ages of 25 and 49. This does not appear in itself  to  have
    anything to do with any IVF treatment.


38. Mr Hossain produced the decision of the Court of  Appeal,  VW  (Uganda)
    and AB (Somalia) v SSHD [2009] EWCA Civ 5. He also produced an  article
    headed "Insurmountable Obstacles Finally Bite the Dust".


39. However, that  decision  and  the  subsequent  article  relate  to  the
    position prior  to  the  coming  into  force  of  the  current  set  of
    Immigration Rules applying to the appellant's application.


40. Mr Whitwell, on behalf of the respondent, submitted that  there  was  a
    clear and obvious typographical error at [40] of the determination. The
    Judge clearly intended to state in the second sentence that he did  not
    accept that there would be insurmountable obstacles for her family life
    to continue together with her husband outside the UK. It is clear  from
    the remainder of that paragraph as well as the finding at  the  end  of
    [41] that the Judge did not accept that there would  be  insurmountable
    obstacles.


41. There has been a change to the Rules since 2009.  For  the  purpose  of
    paragraph EX.1(b) "insurmountable obstacles" means the very significant
    difficulties which would be faced by the applicant or their partner  in
    continuing their family life together in Bangladesh and which could not
    be overcome or would entail  very  serious  hardship  for  her  or  her
    partner.


42. He submitted that the appellant's grounds amount to a disagreement with
    the outcome.


43. The Judge adopted a belt and braces approach and considered Article  8,
    even though finding that there had been  no  exceptional  circumstances
    warranting consideration outside the rules.


44.  He  submitted  that  the  Judge  properly  directed  himself.  In  the
    circumstances, the findings and conclusions are sustainable.


    Assessment


45. The Judge has given a careful and detailed decision. There has been  no
    contention that he failed in any material way to  have  regard  to  any
    relevant evidence or circumstance.


46. He noted that the appellant had not given an adequate explanation as to
    why they "forgot" to apply for her extension. He did not accept that  a
    five year delay in regularising her stay constituted  a  reasonable  or
    justified period in the circumstances [39].


47. He did not accept that either the  appellant  or  her  husband  had  no
    family or relatives in Bangladesh. Both she and her husband could  rely
    on family and friends to help them whilst they established their family
    life in Bangladesh.


48. There is no challenge to that finding in the grounds seeking permission
    to appeal.


49.  The  Judge  has  expressly  found  that  there   are   no   compelling
    circumstances warranting consideration under Article 8.


50. The Judge has nevertheless considered the appeal under  the  provisions
    of Article 8 "for completeness." He directed himself at paragraphs  [5-
    10] in accordance with relevant decisions including SSHD v  SS  (Congo)
    and others; Razgar; Huang; and Agyarko and Others v  SSHD  [2015]  EWCA
    Civ 440; Chikwamba v SSHD and Beoku-Betts v SSHD [2005].


51. He found  that  the  appellant  could  easily  integrate  herself  into
    Bangladesh. She would not need to stay there permanently and only until
    such time as her husband is able to re-apply under the  Rules.  He  has
    also properly directed himself in accordance  with  the  provisions  of
    s.117B  of  the  2002  Act,  concluding  that  her  removal  would   be
    proportionate in the circumstances.


52. I am satisfied that the findings and  conclusions  of  the  Judge  were
    based on the evidence as a whole and are sustainable.
