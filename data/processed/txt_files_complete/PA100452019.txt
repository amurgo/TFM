                            DECISION AND REASONS


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Ms.  K  Degirmenci,  Counsel,  instructed  by  Yemets
Solicitors.
For the Respondent:    Mr. I Jarvis, Senior Presenting Officer


Introduction

 1. This is an appeal against the decision of Judge of the First-tier
    Tribunal Nightingale ('the Judge') sent to the parties on 31 January
    2020 by which the appellant's appeal against the decision to refuse him
    leave to remain on international protection grounds was dismissed.

 2. Judge of the First-tier Tribunal O'Brien granted permission to appeal
    on all grounds by means of a decision dated 5 March 2020.

Remote hearing

 3. The hearing before me was a Skype for Business video conference hearing
    held during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was present in a hearing room at
    Field House. The hearing room and the building were open to the public.
    The hearing and its start time were listed in the cause list. I was
    addressed by the representatives in the same way as if we were together
    in the hearing room. I am satisfied: that this constituted a hearing in
    open court; that the open justice principle has been secured; that no
    party has been prejudiced; and that, insofar as there has been any
    restriction on a right or interest, it is justified as necessary and
    proportionate.

Anonymity

 4. The Judge issued an anonymity direction, and no request was made by
    either party for such direction to be set aside. I confirm the
    direction at the conclusion of this decision. I do so as it is
    presently in the interests of justice that the appellant is not
    publicly recognised as someone seeking international protection:
    paragraph 13 of 'Upper Tribunal Immigration and Asylum Chamber Guidance
    Note 2013 No 1: Anonymity Orders'.

Background

 5. The appellant is a national of Ukraine and aged 33. Whilst in Ukraine
    he married and had a child. He asserts that he undertook military
    service for one year in 2006. Consequent to his military service, he
    had regular, secure employment. Several months after the outbreak of
    war in the Donbass, which commenced in February 2014, the appellant
    received a call-up notice, which he signed for. He was required to go
    to the military commission on identified date. He did not comply. He
    received a second notice. He did not sign for this document nor for
    others subsequently sent to him. In his own words he carried on with
    his life. His wife also received call-up papers.

 6. The respondent details that on 31 July 2017 the appellant applied for a
    visit visa at the British Embassy in Warsaw, stating that he wished to
    visit this country as a tourist. The application was refused on 14
    August 2017.

 7. The appellant states that he entered the United Kingdom clandestinely
    in a lorry in the autumn of 2017, accompanied by his wife. He decided
    that he wanted to remain in this country until the war in Donbass
    concluded, being concerned that if he returned to Ukraine he would have
    to participate in fighting. He asserts that he was supported in this
    country by family members who sent him money every month.

 8. The appellant was arrested at the scene of an accident in January 2019
    and was found to be in possession of false documents. He was
    subsequently sentenced to 8 months in prison for driving under the
    influence of alcohol, document offences and driving without insurance.
    He claimed asylum whilst serving his custodial sentence.

 9. The respondent refused the application for international protection by
    a decision dated 11 October 2019, observing that the appellant had
    given inconsistent dates as to when he had undertaken military service
    and was vague as to the details of his recent call-up. It was noted
    that he had remained in Ukraine until the autumn of 2017 and had not
    experienced any difficulties during such time.

Hearing before the First-tier Tribunal

10. The appeal came before the Judge sitting at Hatton Cross on 23 January
    2020.

11. The Judge made positive findings in favour of the appellant, including
    at [38]:

       . He had undertaken military service in 2006

       . The military ID card presented was genuine

       . As a person who had previously performed military service, he was
         eligible to be called back into the ranks.

12. As to the call-up summons dated 1 February 2015, relied upon by the
    appellant, the Judge concluded, at [39}:

         '39. ... He states that this is the only document which he signed
             for. Professor Galeotti is able to comment on the contents of
             that document which he states, to his best professional
             opinion, appears genuine. He considers the layout, language,
             font and format as well as the citation of the correct law and
             correct addresses for the military commissariat. Professor
             Galeotti, however, can do no more than say that the contents
             appear to be correct. I have proceeded on the basis that there
             is a reasonable degree of likelihood that this document
             calling the appellant up to service in February 2015 is
             genuine.'

13. However, the Judge made several adverse credibility findings. With
    regards to a court summons the Judge was critical as to the
    circumstances in which it was presented, at [40]:

         '40. I have considerable concerns that the court summons was not
             provided to Professor Galeotti for his opinion. Professor
             Galeotti's report is dated 16 January 2020. The witness
             statement from [the appellant's mother-in-law] was provided to
             the Tribunal under covering letter of 19 December 2019 and is
             dated 18 December 2019. This document was not provided to
             Professor Galeotti. I note that this document was translated
             on 11 December 2019 by a certified interpreter. The summons to
             court requires the appellant to attend on 7 August 2019. I can
             find no reason as to why there should have been any delay in
             obtaining this document, providing it to the respondent and,
             indeed, instructing Professor Galeotti to provide an opinion
             on this document. The appellant was in daily contact with his
             mother-in-law until he was sentenced to prison in the United
             Kingdom on 11 February 2019. His custodial sentence would have
             finished around June or July 2019. He must have been back in
             daily contact with his mother-in-law again from this time.
             There is no reason to suspect that his wife was not in daily
             contact with his mother-in-law during this time and, most
             certainly, in August 2019 when it is claimed the school
             proceedings took place.'

14. The Judge concluded, at [40]:

         '40. I find is of considerable concern that court proceedings are
             raised only as a very late stage in these proceedings when, in
             fact, the appellant must have been well aware of the claimed
             prosecution in August or September 2019 by way of his regular
             communication with his mother-in-law. That evidence of legal
             proceedings comes forward only after this refusal where one of
             the key factors indicating a lack of risk to this appellant is
             a lack of prosecution is, I find, highly indicative of recent
             invention to bolster what is, I find, a weak claim.'

15. The Judge observed several discrepancies and inconsistencies in the
    appellant's account which led to her having considerable concerns as to
    the appellant's credibility on key issues of his account. Such concerns
    include:

       . In his asylum interview of May 2019, the appellant states a fear of
         being called up to fight without mentioning an attendant fear of
         criminal prosecution or imprisonment.

       . There is inconsistency and discrepancy as to where the family
         resided in Ukraine. Ms. Degirmenci accepted at the hearing that the
         two stated cities are some 400 km apart.

       . Inconsistency in the statement of the appellant's mother-in-law as
         to where she resided.

16. At [46], the Judge details, inter alia:

         '46. ... His claim as it stands presently has been considerably
             embellished to that made in the course of his asylum
             interview. His claimed prosecution has been evidenced only
             recently despite what I find have been numerous opportunities
             to bring this to the respondent's attention before the refusal
             on 11 October 2019. There has been no credible explanation as
             to why this has not taken place or, indeed, for why there has
             been no reference to these court proceedings in August 2019
             until 16 December 2019 just before the adjourned hearing on 29
             December 2019. With regard to the expert instructed, there is
             no credible explanation given as to why he was not provided
             with this court summons in order to consider it. I also find
             that the background evidence indicates that the period during
             which this appellant and his wife remained in Ukraine was one
             where those who were avoiding conscription were being actively
             sought and pursued. This appellant has latterly claimed that
             he moved to Kyiv, yet he was working for a business in that
             city and returning to his family home. If there had been any
             genuine interest in him during this time, he would have been
             easily traced by the authorities and detained.'

17. The Judge did not accept the court summons to be a genuine document.
    She further found that the appellant had embellished his personal
    history and concluded that there was no real risk that he was sought
    for military service after the first call-up paper in February 2015, of
    being presently liable to be called up for military service, of
    prosecution in respect of a failure to abide by his call-up or of
    detained or imprisoned on return to Ukraine as a result of any criminal
    sentence imposed. She dismissed his appeal.

Grounds of Appeal

18. The grounds of appeal were drafted by Ms. Degirimenci, who did not
    represent the appellant at the hearing before the Judge. They run to
    seven pages and identify four grounds of complaint:

      1) A failure to consider risk on return in light of positive findings
         of credibility and evidence from an expert.

      2) A failure to take into consideration relevant evidence and the
         taking into consideration of irrelevant evidence when making
         adverse probability findings.

      3) The making of a perverse finding in relation to the appellant's
         ability to exempt himself from military service.

      4) A failure to take into consideration relevant evidence in relation
         to section 8 findings.

19. In granting permission to appeal Judge O'Brien concisely identified the
    complaints and reasoned:

         'The Judge appears to criticise the appellant for failing to
         mention in May 2019 a fear of criminal proceedings when it was said
         that there had been no indication until August 2019 that he would
         be prosecuted. Even if the Judge was entitled to reject the
         appellant's claim to have been summonsed to court, there is an
         arguable failure to consider whether the accepted call-up notice of
         2015 would lead to the appellant being identified and consequently
         prosecuted on return in any event, given the expert evidence
         without regard.'

Decision on Error of Law

20. For reasons detailed below, Ms. Degirmenci addressed me on grounds 2 to
    4 at the hearing, with brief reference to ground 1 at the conclusion of
    her submissions.

Ground 1 - Failure to consider risk on return in light of positive findings
of credibility and evidence from an expert.

21. Ms. Degirmenci candidly accepted that ground 1, concerned with the risk
    of the appellant being arrested on return to Ukraine, had now to be
    considered in light of the recent country guidance decision of PK and
    OS (basic rules of human conduct) Ukraine CG [2020] UKUT 00314 (IAC),
    where it was confirmed that it is not reasonably likely that conscripts
    and mobilised reservists who have avoided military service would be
    identified as such at the border. I observe [281] of the country
    guidance decision:

         '281.    We do not find that there is any evidence to suggest that
             Ukraine now has a sophisticated computerised system that
             operates at the border to detect suspected draft evaders upon
             their arrival. As Professor Bowring noted in his first report,
             he has no evidence concerning this issue. To the extent he
             thought that it is likely there would be such a system, we
             consider his evidence to be speculative. Again, there was
             nothing in any of the remaining background materials or media
             reports which supports Professor Bowring's estimate of the
             likely border infrastructure. In fairness to Professor
             Bowring, he clearly stated in his report that he was making an
             informed guess; but it was, nevertheless, speculation. We do
             not consider the findings in VB concerning the prospect of
             criminals convicted in absentia being identified at the border
             to be inconsistent with this conclusion. There is a clear
             distinction between an individual who has failed to report for
             military service who has not been prosecuted, still less
             convicted, on the one hand, and a person who has been
             convicted and sentenced in absentia on the other, which was
             the context in VB.'

22. The complaint advanced by ground 1, which was identified by Judge
    O'Brien as a reason for granting permission to appeal, has been
    addressed by the country guidance decision and no longer enjoys merit.

Ground 2 - Failure to take into consideration relevant evidence and the
taking into consideration of relevant evidence when making adverse
probability findings.

23. Several separate complaints are made within this ground of appeal. I
    observe that when considering the existence or otherwise of a material
    error of law, care must be taken to consider the reasons underpinning a
    decision in the round rather than necessarily focusing upon a forensic
    examination of words or sentences in an isolated manner. An error of
    law is to be material.

24. Complaint is made as the judge's reasoning at [42] of her decision:

         '42. There are also a number of discrepancies within the
             appellant's account. I have read the appellant's Asylum
             Interview Record in full and with care. The appellant's only
             stated fear is of being called to go to war. He raises no fear
             of criminal prosecution or, indeed, of imprisonment. He makes
             no reference in his interview to having moved to Kyiv. He also
             stated before me that he was not stopped at checkpoints.
             However, at question 46 of his interview he states that
             sometimes they stopped at checkpoints but he would 'carry on
             living'. He stated that he lived in Ternopil and made no
             reference to living in Kyiv. He was specifically asked how he
             managed to avoid going into the army and he states that he
             does not know and that they came when he was not home or at
             work or travelling. There is no mention of any relocation to
             Kyiv. I find this causes me considerable difficulties in
             accepting the appellant's claim. It is highly indicative of
             further recent embellishment from the time of the appellant's
             interview.

25. The appellant observes that his interview took place in May 2019 and he
    only received his summons in August 2019. He states, therefore, that he
    could not have mentioned a fear of prosecution before he had received
    the summons. I accept that the Judge did not accurately consider the
    presented chronology. However, I am required to consider the
    materiality of such error.

26. The Judge provides several reasons for not accepting the genuineness of
    the purported criminal proceedings. As Ms. Degirmenci appropriately
    accepted before me a primary reason for the Judge's disbelief as to the
    genuineness of the summons was that there was no credible excavation
    provided as to why it was not presented to the expert to consider. This
    finding, at [46], has not been challenged, and I am satisfied that it
    was a proper decision to be made by the Judge in the circumstances.

27. I observe that the Judge provided further reasons for not accepting the
    credibility of the court summons, consequent to a consideration
    undertaken in accordance with the guidance provided in Tanveer Ahmed:
    [2002] UKIAT 439, [2002] Imm. A.R. 318. The Judge reasoned, at [47]:

         '47. I have considered the court summons in the round in accordance
             with Tanveer Ahmed but I have no expert opinion to assist me
             regarding its authenticity. There are numerous unexplained
             discrepancies in this appellant's account and, also,
             unexplained discrepancies with the background situation
             evidence. The appellant states that he did not think to
             instruct a lawyer in Ukraine regarding these legal proceedings
             in August 2019. As I indicated to Ms. Revill, I have some
             difficulties accepting his evidence that this was not a
             possibility in light of other Ukrainian appeals in which I
             have received evidence from Ukrainian lawyers who have
             attended proceedings which have taken place in absentia.
             However, I accept that the issue is what the appellant
             believed was possible rather than what actually may be
             possible. Nonetheless, he did not instruct any legal
             representation to attend court. I find the claim that there
             have been legal proceedings and that the appellant has been
             sentenced highly questionable and, taken in the round with the
             other concerns I have, I find that it has not been established
             on the lower standard applicable that this appellant has been
             prosecuted or, indeed, convicted or sentenced to any term of
             imprisonment as a result of failing to respond to a
             mobilisation request.'

28. The appellant complains the Judge failed to consider his evidence that
    he had been informed by his mother-in-law that he could not be
    prosecuted if he did not attend the hearing in Ukraine. He states that
    he did not instruct lawyers because he believed that nothing would come
    of the matter. I am satisfied that the Judge had in mind the
    appellant's evidence on this issue, as detailed at [29] of her
    decision. Further, it is clear that the Judge has taken into account
    concerns identifiable within the evidence presented, when considered it
    in the round, which she identifies at [48] as being riddled with
    inconsistency and implausibility. Consequently, the sole challenge to
    [47] enjoys no merits and, so, there is no meritorious challenge to any
    of the relevant adverse findings the Judge made in respect of the court
    summons. That can only mean that the Judge's error of fact identified
    at para. 25 above cannot properly be considered a material error of
    law.

29. A further challenge to the Judge's reasoning at [42] is based upon a
    forensic examination of the appellant's evidence, as detailed at �10 of
    the grounds of appeal:

         '10. Further at paragraph 42, the Judge also finds his evidence
             discrepant regarding whether he had been stopped at
             checkpoints, stating 'He also stated before me that he was not
             stopped at checkpoints. However, at question 46 of his
             interview he states that sometimes they stopped at checkpoints
             but he would 'carry on living''. However, on a careful reading
             of question 46, the appellant did not say that he was ever
             stopped at a checkpoint. The answer is recorded as 'I lived in
             fear but carry on living. I was always worried. Sometimes they
             stopped at checkpoints but carry on living.' His reference to
             the checkpoints related to his fear and not to him having been
             stopped.'

30. Upon considering question 46 of the interview and the corresponding
    answer, I am satisfied that on a reasonable and natural reading the
    appellant accepted that sometimes he was stopped at checkpoints. In
    such circumstances the judge cannot be criticised for believing the
    appellant's answer before her to be inconsistent with his answer given
    in interview. There is no merit in this complaint

31. Complaint is made as to the Judge's finding concerning the failure of
    the authorities to prosecute the appellant's wife, addressed at [44] of
    the decision:

         '44. The appellant does not appear to have made any attempt to
             depart Ukraine between 2015 and autumn 2017. From the expert
             report, it appears that this was during the height of the
             conscription drive, but also during the time of the beginning
             of the prosecutions of those who were avoiding conscription.
             The statement of the appellant's mother-in-law, at paragraphs
             11 to 12, described the incident where the village council
             member named Ivan approached her as the catalyst for the
             departure of the appellant and her daughter from Ukraine. She
             says that Ivan told her that as the appellant had not
             responded to any of the call-up papers that the matter had
             been referred for him to be prosecuted. Since both the
             appellant and his wife are said to be avoiding conscription,
             it is unclear why the appellant would be prosecuted and not
             his wife ...'

32. This paragraph must be read with [41] of the decision, which Ms.
    Degirmenci accepts has not been challenged. Noting the evidence of the
    appellant's wife that she had received a call-up papers and had
    remained in the family home throughout the relevant time until leaving
    the country with her husband in autumn 2017, the Judge found, at [41]:

         '41. ... I note the expert report regarding the efforts of the
             authorities to pursue those dodging the call-up during this
             period. I also note that it is claimed that the appellant's
             wife received call-up papers to go to the army. She remained
             in the family home throughout her time in Ukraine, leaving
             only with the appellant in autumn 2017. There is nothing new
             for me to indicate that she was pursued for military service
             or, indeed, that she had any difficulties. She would have been
             easy for the authorities to locate and, I find, her continued
             presence in the family home indicates that the authorities had
             little interest in pursuing the call-up papers.'

33. In the circumstances, the challenge advanced as to [44] falls away
    because the Judge has given adequate and lawful reasons as to why she
    concluded that the authorities had little interest in prosecuting the
    appellant's wife, and this was a lawful reason to not accept that the
    authorities had an interest in prosecuting the appellant.

34. I find that the complaint identified at �15 of the grounds of appeal
    concerned with the Judge's finding at [46] of the decision, detailed
    above, is simply a disagreement as to findings of fact made and
    identifies no meritorious challenge as to the existence of a material
    error of law.

35. As for the complaint identified at �16 of the grounds, Ms Degirmenci
    took me to the appellant's visa application of July 2017 which
    identified the appellant as having stated that he resided in Kyiv. She
    accepted that he detailed his wife as living in Ternopil oblast. The
    difficulty for the appellant in advancing this ground of challenge is
    the significant inconsistency and discrepancy in the evidence presented
    as to where the appellant resided and worked. I am satisfied that the
    Judge could reasonably make an adverse finding at [42] in circumstances
    where in his interview the appellant confirmed that his last address in
    Ukraine was in Ternopil oblast and that his parents resided at the same
    address. He further confirmed that he lived in Ternopil at Q51 of his
    interview. There is no merit in this challenge.

36. Consequently, this ground of appeal is dismissed.

Ground 3 - The making of a perverse finding in relation to the appellant's
ability to exempt himself from military service.

37. The appellant asserts at �18 of his grounds of appeal:

         '18. At paragraph 48, the Judge concludes that she does not believe
             the appellant received any repeated requests to attend
             military service, 'or indeed, that the appellant has not, in
             fact, been able to exempt himself from any requirement to
             serve'. This is a perverse finding not based on any evidence
             before the Judge.

38. It is appropriate to consider [48] of the decision in its entirety:

         '48. I find that the appellant has established only that it is
             reasonably likely that he has undertaken military service
             previously in Ukraine and that he received one call-up notice
             in February 2015. I do not find on the lower standard
             applicable that this call-up request was repeated or, indeed,
             that the appellant has not, in fact, been able to exempt
             himself from any requirement to serve. I find his account
             riddled with inconsistencies and a number of aspects of his
             claim are so implausible that I reject his account on the
             lower standard applicable. I do not find any real risk that he
             was sought for military service after the first call-up paper
             in February 2015 or that he is presently liable to be called
             up for military service or that he has been prosecuted or that
             would be detained or imprisoned on return as a result of any
             criminal sentence imposed. I find that he is not at risk on
             return for the reasons claimed and that he does not make a
             claim to asylum, humanitarian protection or in article 3
             grounds.'

39. The section of the paragraph complained of unfortunately adopts the use
    of a double negative: 'I do not find on the lower standard applicable
    ... that the appellant has not, in fact, been able to exempt himself
    from any requirement to serve'. Giving the benefit to the appellant, it
    can read as a finding that the appellant has secured exemption from
    military service, which was not an issue addressed at the hearing.
    However, nowhere else in the decision is there reliance upon this
    finding and as is clear from [48], when read as a whole, there are
    numerous reasons as to why the Judge did not accept that the appellant
    possessed a well-founded fear of persecution in respect of (1) being
    sought for military service after the first call-up paper in February
    2015, (2) being presently liable to be called up for military service,
    (3) having been prosecuted, and (4) being detained or imprisoned on
    return as a result of any criminal sentence imposed. Such findings were
    expressly based upon the rejection of the appellant's account
    consequent to it being riddled with inconsistency and implausibility,
    not upon a finding that he had secured exemption from military service.
    In such circumstances there is no merit to this ground of appeal.

Ground 4 - A failure to take into consideration relevant evidence in
relation to section 8 findings.

40. Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc)
    Act 2004 lists various behaviours which must be taken into account as
    potentially damaging an appellant's credibility, including a delay in
    making an asylum claim.

41. By means of this ground of appeal the appellant challenges findings as
    to delay made by the Judge at [45] of her decision:

         '45. In addition to the foregoing, I find that there has been no
             explanation for the delay in claiming asylum. The appellant
             claims that he had come to United Kingdom for safety yet made
             no attempt to claim asylum until he was arrested by the police
             in January 2019; around eighteen months after his claimed
             arrival. Although such delay may not be determinative of
             overall credibility, I find it raises further considerable
             doubts as to the genuine nature of the appellant's claim to
             require protection.'

42. It is said that the Judge failed take into consideration, or make a
    finding upon, the appellant's explanation as to why he delayed in
    making his claim for international protection. The appellant states
    that following his arrival in this country he sought legal advice and
    was informed that he could be detained then returned to Ukraine.
    Fearful of this, he decided to lay low until the conflict in Ukraine
    came to an end.

43. I accept the appellant's contention that the Judge erred in stating
    that no explanation had been provided as to the delay in claiming
    asylum. His explanation is provided in his statement of 17 December
    2019 when addressing questions 52 and 53 of his interview. However,
    when taking this evidence at its highest the lawyer simply informed the
    appellant that there was a 'chance' of detention and removal. It was
    the appellant's decision not to claim asylum and, in the meantime, he
    continued to reside in this country with false documents. I observe
    that the Judge did not place excessive weight upon such delay when
    assessing credibility, rather placing it in the mix with the
    appellant's inconsistent and implausible evidence. In the
    circumstances, whilst there was an error of law in not considering the
    explanation provided as to why there was a delay in seeking
    international protection, such error cannot properly be considered to
    be material when considering the overall evidential findings.

44. For these reasons, this appeal must fail.
