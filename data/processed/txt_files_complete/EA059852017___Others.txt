                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


    This is an appeal, by the s, against the  decision  of  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge Christopher Randall), sitting at  Hatton  Cross  on  28
    May, to  EEA appeals by the (main) , a citizen of Nigeria,  born  1974,
    and his dependent wife and sons.

 2. The appellant's elder  son  was  born  in  Nigeria  on  30  July  2005,
    following which the family went to Italy, where his grown-up son  Andr�
    Djossou was living. Their younger son was born  there  on  14  February
    2007, but like the others is a Nigerian  citizen.  In  2009  they  came
    here, the appellant as a student and the others as his dependants, with
    leave till 2011. On 10 January 2012 they  were  issued  with  five-year
    residence cards as the dependants  of  Andr�,  now  here  too,  and  an
    Italian citizen.

 3. On 9 January 2017 the appellants applied for permanent residence cards;
    but on 15 June last year they were refused, a decision  upheld  by  the
    judge, who noted that the appellant himself had been earning more  than
    Andr�, especially for their first three years with residence cards,  so
    that they were not dependent on him. There is now no issue on that.

 4. The issue before me is on the appellants' alternative submission, dealt
    with by the judge at paragraphs 56 - 57. They argued that, even if they
    were not entitled to a permanent right of residence,  they  were  still
    entitled to residence cards, since, following  an  injury  in  December
    2017, the appellant himself had been unable to work. The judge found in
    their favour on the facts, and that finding is  not  challenged  by  Mr
    Bramble; but he took the view that it was not open to  the  appellants,
    having applied for permanent residence  cards,  now  to  seek  ordinary
    ones, and that was supported by Mr Bramble.

 5. Mr Moriarty referred to the broad rights of appeal given by reg. 36  of
    the  Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016,  taken
    together with s. 84 (1) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum  Act
    2002, allowing it simply to be argued

         (d)  that the appellant is an EEA  national  or  a  member  of  the
         family of an EEA national and the decision breaches the appellant�s
         rights under the Community Treaties  in  respect  of  entry  to  or
         residence in the United Kingdom;

 6. He went on to point out that the  issue  of  residence  cards  involves
    recognition,  rather  than  creation  of  rights,  and  that  excessive
    technicality is not required in cases of this kind: see HB  (EEA  right
    to reside -  Metock)  Algeria  [2008]  UKAIT  00069,  if  authority  is
    required for this trite proposition.

 7. Mr Bramble referred to  the  judge's  point  at  57  that  neither  the
    covering letter with the applications for permanent right of residence,
    nor the forms themselves, nor the grounds of appeal had mentioned  this
    alternative possibility. Mr Moriarty had already given  his  answer  to
    this point, partly in terms of the argument already set out, and partly
    on the basis of the  prescribed  form,  which  made  no  allowance  for
    alternative applications. This  would  mean  that  appellants  in  this
    position would have to make, and presumably pay for  two  applications,
    or in this case two sets of them, at the same time.

 8. I agree with Mr Moriarty that insisting on this could  not  be  in  the
    public interest, any more than that of the appellants. While  it  would
    have been helpful, to say the least, if the possibility had been raised
    in advance of the first-tier hearing, it  was  clearly  raised  in  the
    grounds of appeal to the Upper Tribunal, and permission was granted  on
    this point only. The respondent's r. 24 response argues that the  judge
    was right on it, and it must be left to the appellants to make  further
    applications now if they wished.

 9. If the issue of ordinary  residence  cards  had  required  any  further
    findings of fact, or resolution of any challenge to those made  by  the
    judge at 36, then there might have been something to be  said  for  the
    respondent's argument. However that is not the  case  here,  where  the
    facts are agreed: the  overriding  objective  (see  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 r.2) is to deal with cases fairly,  justly,
    proportionately to their nature and to the resources  of  the  parties,
    without  unnecessary  formality,  and  with  as  much  flexibility   as
    possible. Those acting for the respondent should bear this objective in
    mind when drafting r. 24 responses,  still  more  when  arguing  second
    appeals.

10. Here I regard it as clear beyond argument that this objective would  be
    best served by allowing these appeals, with a direction to issue  these
    appellants with ordinary residence cards, on the basis that  they  have
    all been dependent on Andr� since December 2017.

Appeals :: direction accordingly
