Representatives:

Mr P J Linstead of Counsel, instructed by Afrifa & Partners, Solicitors  for
the appellant;  Mr G  Saunders,  Home  Office  Presenting  Officer  for  the
respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.    The appellant  is  a  national  of  Eritrea.  She  appeals  against  a
      determination of Adjudicator, Mr J F  Pullig,  dismissing  her  appeal
      against a decision giving directions for removal following refusal  to
      grant asylum.

2.    The grounds of appeal  to  the  Tribunal  sought  to  argue  that  the
      Adjudicator was wrong to reject the appellant's account  of  being  at
      risk by virtue of her fianc�'s  political activities.  At  the  outset
      of the appeal, we accepted an application  to  amend  the  grounds  of
      appeal so as to put in issue the additional matter of whether, in  the
      light of the country guideline case of  MA  Eritrea  CG  [2004]  UKIAT
      00098 heard on 11 April 2004 by a Tribunal chaired by  the  President,
      Ouseley J, the appellant was entitled to succeed on the basis that  on
      return she would be classified as a female draft evader.

3.    We are not persuaded that  the  Adjudicator  was  wrong  to  find  the
      appellant's account of most matters not credible. It was entirely open
      to him on the evidence to find inconsistent her account  that  on  the
      one hand she knew nothing about the identities of people who  attended
      the meeting, yet on the other hand that she knew they  were  of  mixed
      ethnicity and so were anti-government.

4.    The Adjudicator was entitled to find it  implausible,  if  the  police
      had discovered documents  at her home, that she would  not  have  been
      asked questions about them, particularly if she had been suspected  of
      collaborating with her fianc�.   The Adjudicator took careful note  of
      the appellant's attempts to explain these matters, saying  in  respect
      of the first that she knew of the documents but not the  details  they
      concerned and, in respect of the other, that she did not know  yet  it
      was possible they had enough evidence to bring her to a court of  law.
      The claim that she knew the documents  were  anti-government  was  not
      consistent with her account at interview where  she  stated  she  knew
      nothing:  see question 11.  The possibility that the  police  did  not
      question  her because they had enough evidence already  was  correctly
      considered remote.

5.    We acknowledge that, taken  in  isolation,  there  is  a  sentence  at
      paragraph 39 of the determination which appeared to  accept  that  the
      appellant was arrested. However, when read in  context,  it  is  clear
      that the Adjudicator was doing no more than considering aspects of her
      claim in respect of the documents on the hypothetical assumption of an
      arrest.

6.    We see nothing in the argument that the Adjudicator failed  to  assess
      the appellant's story in the context  of the  evidence   as  a  whole.
      The Adjudicator made detailed reference  to  a  number  of  background
      sources, including the CIPU Report, the Amnesty International   Report
      and the Human Rights Watch Report. It may be that  these  showed  that
      those suspected of dissident activity during the relevant  period  did
      face arrests and detentions. However, the appellant's  account  failed
      to show that she was ever suspected of dissident  activity  either  on
      her own account or through connection with a dissident fianc�.

7.    The Adjudicator plainly considered the appellant's claim that her  and
      her fianc�'s bank account had been frozen. Once again, it may well  be
      the freezing of bank accounts is a measure  used  by  the  authorities
      against dissidents,  especially  those  seen  as  Ethiopian  or  part-
      Ethiopian.  However,  this  background  evidence  was  not  enough  to
      overcome the appellant's failure to show that any part of  her  story,
      including that about her and her fianc�'s bank accounts being  frozen,
      was credible.

8.    It is correct that the Adjudicator did not make specific  findings  on
      all aspects of the appellant's claimed adverse experiences in Eritrea.
      However, it was sufficiently clear, in the light of  the  findings  he
      did make clear that he did not find her credible in any event.

9.    Given the Adjudicator's primary findings of fact (which we have  found
      to be sustainable) it was not necessary for him to address  the  issue
      of whether she would face prosecution by the authorities  and  whether
      such prosecution would be persecutory.

10.   This leaves as the only outstanding grounds of appeal (1) whether  the
      appellant would be at risk as a female draft evader  and  (2)  whether
      she would be at risk as a mere returnee.

11.   Mr Linstead on behalf of the appellant submitted that in the light  of
      the country guideline decision, MA Eritrea C G [2004] UKIAT 00098, the
      appellant was entitled to succeed in her appeal on both grounds.

12.   The facts in MA were that the appellant claimed to have  left  Eritrea
      having been required, as  a  sixteen  year  old,  to  report  for  her
      compulsory military training.  The Adjudicator rejected her claim that
      she had received her call-up papers when she was sixteen but she  said
      that the  appellant was now over eighteen and on her return to Eritrea
      would be required to complete her military training.  She  found  that
      the appellant would be seen either as a draft  evader  or  as  someone
      required to do military  service.   The  Tribunal  accepted  that  the
      Adjudicator put the appellant into one or other of the two categories,
      and that it may not have been possible to know into which category the
      Eritrean authorities would put her. It was, however, necessary for the
      Adjudicator to examine both of the possibilities. The Adjudicator  did
      not do so and the Tribunal went on to consider the appeal on the basis
      that the appellant was a draft evader as  found  by  the  Adjudicator.
      There was no cross-appeal  by  the  Secretary  of  State  against  the
      Adjudicator's finding that the appellant was a draft evader,  although
      she had rejected her claim  to  have  received  call-up  papers.   The
      Tribunal then went on to consider the  treatment  that  draft  evaders
      were likely to face.

13.   Dealing  first  with  the  female  draft  evader  issue,  Mr  Saunders
      disputed this on two footings. Firstly, there was no evidential  basis
      in this case for considering that the appellant would be perceived  as
      a female draft evader. At  no  point  had  the  appellant  placed  any
      reliance on this contention.  Furthermore, the war with  Ethiopia  had
      started in 1998 and there was no suggestion that the  authorities  had
      viewed her as a draft evader, despite the fact  that  she  had  become
      eligible quite some number of years earlier.   Mr  Linstead  countered
      that the fact of the matter was that she was still of eligible age and
      so had to be considered as someone  who  could  be  classified  as  an
      evader.

14.   We agree with Mr Saunders on this point.   If  there  is  no  evidence
      that the authorities have taken steps  to  call  someone  up,  over  a
      significant period of time during which such a person was eligible, it
      is it hard to accept they would classify him or her as an  evader  the
      first time they came into contact with such a person. If  Mr  Linstead
      were right,  then  the  Eritrean  government  would  view  its  entire
      population in the eligible age range as  draft  evaders.   Plainly  it
      does not.

15.   Nor in this case do we think the appellant established  that  she  had
      left Eritrea illegally. She spoke about   crossing  the   border  into
      Sudan, but has  always  maintained  that  her  agent  had  a  passport
      arranged for her. She had this passport when she left Sudan and it was
      this passport which she said was used by her agent to take her through
      UK  controls. On the basis of that evidence, she had  not  established
      that her passport should be  considered  to  have  been  false  or  in
      someone else's name.

16.   Since the appellant  failed  to  establish  that  she  exited  Eritrea
      illegally, it cannot be concluded that the authorities upon her return
      would view her has someone who had left in circumstances  designed  to
      avoid compliance with her duty to perform military service.

17.   Mr Linstead urged us to allow the appeal in any event,  since  in  his
      view the country guideline  case  of  MA  Eritrea  went  further  than
      finding that female draft evaders  were at risk and  in  effect  found
      that all returnees, male or female, would be at risk.  He  based  this
      submission on paragraphs of this determination  wherein  the  Tribunal
      noted the evidence concerning the Maltese returnees: These  paragraphs
      stated:

             '23. The UNHCR recommendation for temporary  protection  while
                 the situation is reviewed in   mid 2004 is weighty. But the
                 material which is the most troubling is that which concerns
                 the forced return from Malta of those  who  were  of  draft
                 age, and were in part at least failed asylum seekers.  They
                 appear to be held incommunicado, without charge  or  visits
                 in conditions which do not appear to be simply the  spartan
                 ones to which CIPU referred for civilian prisons.  Although
                 the UNHCR Report refers to "dwellings" where  they  are  be
                 detained,  the  conditions  which  are  described  included
                 forced labour, beatings, torture, and  a  lack  of  medical
                 care, food or sanitation leading to  disease  and  in  some
                 cases death. These conditions are quite likely to involve a
                 breach of Article 3. Because this evidence relates  to  the
                 experience of those who were actually returned, significant
                 weight has to be given to it. We do not know all  of  their
                 circumstances, why they left   Eritrea  and  what  measures
                 were taken  to  prepare  their  return  with  the  Eritrean
                 authorities. The evidence is credible. There  is  no  other
                 evidence as to what happens to those who are  returned  and
                 no better evidence as to what happened  to  those  returned
                 from Malta.


             24. At present it appears to us from that evidence that  there
                 is a real risk that the appellant would be subjected to the
                 same treatment as those deported from Malta  and  that  her
                 rights under Article 3 would be breached. That position may
                 change with the UNHCR review or with other evidence  as  to
                 how someone in the  position  of  the  appellant  would  be
                 treated on return, or other evidence as to the position  of
                 those deported from Malta.'

18.   We are bound to say  we  have  great  difficulty  with  Mr  Linstead's
      submission on this matter.  In the first place, when  the  Adjudicator
      promulgated his determination (5  November  2003),  MA  had  not  been
      decided. By virtue of the  Court  of  Appeal  judgment  in  CA  [2004]
         EWCA Civ 1165, save where there is a material error of law, we  are
      not entitled to take  into  account  Tribunal  guidelines  on  country
      conditions which were not in existence at  the  time  the  Adjudicator
      promulgated his determination. When the Adjudicator  dealt  with  this
      appeal it could  not  be  said  that   he  was  compelled,  either  by
      Tribunal guidelines or the objective evidence before him, to  conclude
      that all returnees were at risk.

19.   Secondly, even if we were entitled to test  for  legal  error  in  the
      Adjudicator's determination  by  reference  to  a  subsequent  country
      guideline case, we do not consider MA is or was ever  intended  to  be
      authority for the proposition that returnees generally  are  at  risk.
      At paragraphs 6 and 20 the President made very clear  that  the  "real
      question" he sought to address in this determination was "... the sort
      of  treatment  which  she  would  receive  as  someone  who  would  be
      identified as a draft evader".  We do not think that  the  resolve  to
      confine the issue to female draft evaders could  have  been  made  any
      clearer than that.

20.   As already noted, the objective materials before the Adjudicator  when
      he dealt with this case, albeit they did  contain  references  to  and
      commentary on the  2002 events affecting some 220  Maltese  returnees,
      did not compel a conclusion that returnees  generally  were  at  risk.
      Nor at that time was there any Tribunal or court guidance stating that
      returnees generally were at risk. Mr Linstead has asked us to consider
      two documents which were not before the Adjudicator  or indeed  before
      the Tribunal in MA,  the  CIPU  April  2004  Report  and  the  Amnesty
      International  Report May 2004.  However, once again, by virtue of the
      Court of Appeal judgment in CA [2004] EWCA Civ 1165, save where  there
      is a material error of law, we are not entitled to take such items  of
      evidence  into  account,  since  they  came  into  being   after   the
      Adjudicator promulgated his determination  (5 November 2003).

21.   However, in order to furnish guidance on this issue, we will go on  to
      consider whether, even had we taken account of these recent  items  of
      evidence, we would have found returnees generally to be at risk.

22.   Our conclusion is that these materials do not  establish  a  risk  for
      returnees generally. In the first place, the problems relating to  the
      Maltese returnees were clearly linked closely with the  perception  by
      the  Eritrean  authorities  that  they  were  draft  evaders  or  omit
      deserters. The May 2004 AI Report refers to  the  Malta  deportees  as
      "mostly army deserters or conscription evaders" (see p.23).

23.   Secondly, even within the group of Maltese returnees, the  authorities
      plainly differentiated on the basis of both sex and age: the May  2004
      AI Report notes that women, children and those over  the  conscription
      age limit of forty years were released after some weeks in  Adi  Abeto
      prison.

24.   Thirdly, whatever may have been the degree of adverse treatment  meted
      out to the Maltese returnees in 2002,   there  have  been  no  similar
      large scale incidents since. Particularly given  that  the  UNHCR  has
      clearly been monitoring the situation very closely, we  consider  this
      lack of repetition very  significant.  It  is  true  there  have  been
      incidents involving returnees since, but these have been very few  and
      in  each  case  they  have  only  involved  a  very  small  number  of
      individuals.   Furthermore,  they  have  largely  been   confined   to
      returnees with foreign citizenships. Thus at  p. 22 of the May 2004 AI
      Report there are references  to  five  cases  of  difficulties  facing
      Eritreans with foreign citizenships.

25.   Fourthly, we find it important to take account of the precise  wording
      of the UNHCR "Position on the Return of  Rejected  Asylum  Seekers  to
      Eritrea" dated 20 January 2004. This letter does state  that,  in  the
      light of the  problems faced by the Maltese returnees  "it  cannot  be
      excluded that future deportees would face a similar risk"; and it goes
      on to recommend that  "states  refrain  from  all  forced  returns  of
      rejected asylum seekers to Eritrea and grant them complementary  forms
      of protection instead". However it falls short  of  stating  that  all
      returnees face a well-founded fear  of  persecution;  it  leaves  that
      issue for assessment based on the individual needs of  asylum  seekers
      for international  protection.   Furthermore  "protection"  is  itself
      clearly viewed by UNHCR as a broader category than  protection   under
      the  1951 Convention or under Article 3 of the ECHR. In addition,  the
      language of this Position paper is that of mere possibility  ("...  it
      cannot be excluded that ...").  It is not that of real possibility  or
      real risk.

26.   For reasons already given we do not think that the   contents  of  the
      May 2004 AI Report justify a conclusion that returnees  generally  are
      at risk.  We would note further that even in this report the  position
      of Amnesty International is not unequivocally that all  returnees  are
      at risk. It does appear   at  pp.25-26  to  suggest  that  anyone  the
      authorities  learnt was a failed asylum seeker would be at  risk,  but
      the formulation of the list of categories to be at risk  is  otherwise
      more limited.

27.   Accordingly, (1) we do not consider that the  Tribunal   determination
      in MA was intended to establish that all returnees to Eritrea  are  at
      risk; (2) the Tribunal position on this issue before  and  after  this
      decision remains that the mere fact of being  a  returnee  to  Eritrea
      does not mean that someone will face a real risk of serious harm.

28.   For the above reasons this appeal is dismissed.
