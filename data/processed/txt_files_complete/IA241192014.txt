               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. P Haywood, Counsel
For the Respondent:     Mr. I Jarvis, HOPO


                            NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL


1.   The respondent obtained permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal
    against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal promulgated on 25 August
    2015 allowing the appeal of the appellant on a limited basis.  The
    First-tier Tribunal remitted the case to the Secretary of State so that
    the immigration history of the appellant can be clarified; and a
    further decision can be made, against which further appeal rights will
    lie.

2.   An error of law has been established.

3.   I consented to the withdrawal of the Secretary of State's decision,
    which in turn led to the withdrawal of the appellant's case.

4.   On agreement, the appellant will submit to the Secretary of State an
    application for leave to remain on the right form (SET(LR)) and pay the
    appropriate fee within 28 days of this Notice.

5.   Accordingly, with my consent, and pursuant to rule 17(5) of the
    Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008, this appeal is recorded
    as "withdrawn with the consent of the Upper Tribunal".  The effective
    of this is that the proceedings before the Upper Tribunal are at an
    end.
