For the Appellant:     Mr D Clarke, Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No Representation and No Appearance


                            DECISION AND REASONS


1.   Although this is an appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department I shall refer to the parties as in the First-tier  Tribunal.
    The Appellant is a citizen of Turkey born  on  10  February  1961.  Her
    appeal against the refusal of entry clearance was allowed by First-tier
    Tribunal Judge Abebrese on 22 February 2017.

2.   The Secretary of State appealed on the ground that the judge  erred  in
    law in finding that the financial requirements could be  met.  Appendix
    FM-SE states that third party support will only be accepted in the form
    of income from a dependent child who has turned 18, remains in the same
    UK household as the applicant and continues to be counted  towards  the
    financial requirements under Appendix FM. The Rule  required  that  the
    child live in the same household as the applicant  which  was  not  the
    case. If 'applicant' can also relate to 'sponsor' then the judge  erred
    in law in failing to make findings regarding whether or not the Sponsor
    lived with his son.

3.   In relation to the English language requirements the  judge  failed  to
    make any findings on how the Appellant's  medical  condition  prevented
    her from taking an English language test.

4.   Permission was granted by First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Robertson  on  11
    September 2017 for the following reasons: "Pursuant to  the  provisions
    of Appendix FM-SE at paragraph 1(b)(ii) 'income from an dependent child
    who was turned 18 remains in the same UK household as the applicant and
    continues  to  be  counted  towards  the  financial  requirement  under
    Appendix FM. This is a provision that the  judge  was  aware  of  [23].
    However, it is arguable as submitted in the grounds, that the judge did
    not consider whether the Sponsor's son, Mr  Kenan  Karatay,  was  still
    dependent on him or a member of his household. The reasons given by the
    judge at [24] for preferring the evidence of the Sponsor and his son do
    not amount in terms to a finding that the provisions of Appendix  FM-SE
    at paragraph 1(b)(ii) are met. As permission is granted on this  ground
    the Respondent is not precluded from arguing the English language point
    raised in the grounds.

5.   The Appellant did not attend  the  hearing  and  was  not  represented.
    Enquiries were made and an email was sent, at  11.56am  on  8  December
    2017,  from  the  Appellant's  representative  apologising   for   late
    confirmation of non-attendance. The  email  states:  "Please  find  our
    client's instructions as he does not wish us to attend the  hearing  as
    of this morning.  I have enclosed confirmation on his  instructions  in
    this matter. I have also emailed the  Tribunal  to  confirm  we  cannot
    attend. I appreciate if the judge can make the decision considering the
    applicant's application in favour of our client as  our  client  has  a
    genuine relationship as a married couple.  He is  a  pensioner  with  a
    private pension and state pension in the UK. Our  client  is  receiving
    high rate of Class A retirement pension. The applicant's  husband  also
    has savings which he is able to support his wife's application. In  our
    appeal we have submitted the relevant evidence  and  our  advocate  has
    given information which show that our  client  has  a  good  character.
    Their intention is to live in the UK. The applicant's family are all in
    the UK and the applicant and her husband wanted  to  spend  their  life
    with their children in the UK.  Please be advised, that the applicant's
    husband is in Turkey with her."  There was a letter  dated  3  December
    2017  from  Mustafa  Karatay  stating  that  he  did  not   require   a
    representative to represent him on Friday 8 December 2017.

6.   There was no application for an adjournment and it is  clear  from  the
    email that the Appellant did not require her representatives to  attend
    court in order to pursue her appeal and that the Sponsor was not  going
    to be present at the appeal hearing because he is in  Turkey  with  the
    Appellant. Accordingly I  am  satisfied  that  the  Appellant  and  her
    representatives are aware of the hearing date. There was no  reason  to
    adjourn the appeal and I proceed in the Appellant's absence.

7.   Mr Clarke submitted that there was an error of law in the  decision  of
    the First-tier Tribunal because the Appellant was unable to rely on the
    income  from  the  Sponsor's  son  in   relation   to   the   financial
    requirements.  The documentary evidence showed that Mr Mustafa  Karatay
    lived at [ ] London [ ] whereas his son in his statement stated that he
    is the proprietor of [ ] Colchester [ ].

8.   On the evidence before the judge it was clear that  the  Sponsor's  son
    did not live in the same household  as  either  the  Appellant  or  the
    Sponsor. Further, his son was born on 1 September 1965 so he could  not
    be said to be a dependent child given that he appears to  run  his  own
    business and lives at a different address.

9.   Accordingly, I find that the judge erred in law in taking into  account
    the �550 per month which the Sponsor's son contributed to the Appellant
    and Sponsor's household.  It is clear from Appendix FM-SE that  he  was
    not a dependent child who had turned 18 and who remained in the same UK
    household of either the Appellant or the Sponsor. His income could  not
    taken into account in assessing whether  the  Appellant  satisfied  the
    financial requirements of the Immigration Rules.

10.  I find that the judge made an error  of  law  in  taking  into  account
    income from the  Sponsor's son in  calculating  whether  the  Appellant
    satisfied the financial requirements of the Immigration Rules; �550 per
    month could not be taken into account.

11.  Given that the appeal  fails  on  this  ground  there  is  no  need  to
    determine whether the Appellant had to  satisfy  the  English  language
    requirement and Mr Clarke did not make submissions on  this  point  and
    there were no submissions from the Appellant. It is apparent  from  the
    evidence before the First-tier Tribunal Judge that there was no  reason
    why the Appellant should not have to take an English language test  and
    on the evidence  before  me  she  does  not  qualify  for  one  of  the
    exceptions.

12.  There was no challenge in the grounds of appeal to the judge's  finding
    that the relationship was genuine and subsisting.  Accordingly, I  find
    that  the  judge  has  erred  in  law  in  relation  to  the  financial
    requirement and the English language test.  The  ECO  was  entitled  to
    refuse entry clearance on the basis that the  Appellant  did  not  have
    sufficient funds and she was not exempt from taking an English language
    test.

13.  The judge erred in law in taking into account income that  he  was  not
    entitled to do and in irrationally concluding that  the  Appellant  was
    entitled to benefit from the exceptions to taking an  English  language
    test when there was insufficient evidence before the judge to show that
    the Appellant had satisfied that requirement. I set aside the  decision
    of 22 February 2017 and I remake it. The Appellant's appeal against the
    refusal of entry clearance is dismissed.
