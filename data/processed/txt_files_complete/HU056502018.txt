Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr I Jarvis, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr G Hodgetts, Counsel, instructed by Prime Law
Solicitors


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision issued on 27  December  2018  of
    First-tier Tribunal Judge Rowlands which allowed the appeal of Mr Iqbal
    against a decision refusing indefinite leave to  remain  (ILR)  on  the
    basis that paragraph 322(5) of the Immigration Rules applied.

 2. For the purposes of this decision we refer to the  Secretary  of  State
    for the Home Department as the  respondent  and  to  Mr  Iqbal  as  the
    appellant, reflecting their positions before the First-Tier Tribunal.

 3. Mr Iqbal was born on 30 April 1981 in Bangladesh.  He came to the UK on
    15 January 2007 as a student.  He had leave in various categories until
    2 July 2016.  On 30 June 2016 he applied for ILR as a General  Migrant.
    On 19 December 2016 he varied that application to one for  ILR  on  the
    basis of long residence.

 4.  On 15 February 2018 the respondent refused the  application  for  ILR.
    The application was refused  as  the  respondent  considered  that  the
    appellant had been dishonest when he made  discrepant  declarations  of
    income to HMRC and to the  Home  Office  when  applying  for  leave  in
    2010/11 and 2012/13. The declaration  of  taxable  income  to  HMRC  in
    2010/2011 was �26,132. In an application for leave  made  on  30  March
    2011 he declared an income of �35,983.26. The  declaration  of  taxable
    income to HMRC in 2012/2013 was �19,031. In an  application  for  leave
    made on 14 May 2013 he declared an income of �35,862.14.

 5. The respondent accepted that the appellant had made an application on 4
    August 2016 to revise his tax on the declarations made in 2010/2011 and
    2012/13 and had paid the additional tax due. The respondent remained of
    the view that the discrepancies and  the  delay  of  several  years  in
    correcting them showed dishonesty. The respondent did not  accept  that
    the  appellant's  explanation  that  his  previous   accountants   were
    careless, made errors and did not communicate with him properly  was  a
    credible explanation for the discrepant declarations to the Home Office
    and HMRC. The  respondent  therefore  applied  paragraph  322(5)  which
    states that an application may be refused on the following basis:

         "The undesirability of permitting the person concerned to remain in
         the United Kingdom in light of his conduct  (including  convictions
         which  do  not  fall  within  paragraph   322(1C),   character   or
         associations or the fact that he represents a  threat  to  national
         security;"

 6. The appellant appealed the refusal of leave to the First-tier  Tribunal
    leading to the decision issued on  27  December  2018  which  is  under
    challenge  here.  The  First-tier  Tribunal  set  out  the  appellant's
    evidence in paragraphs 5 to 9 of the decision. That  evidence  included
    his explanation of how the incorrect declarations of  income  had  been
    made to  HMRC,  what  steps  he  had  taken  to  remedy  the  incorrect
    declarations and why he had delayed in doing so. The  appellant's  core
    case was that he had been na�ve and  careless,  had  signed  blank  tax
    returns and not dealt with the matter promptly when he became aware  of
    it but had not acted dishonestly. His accountants had  also  not  acted
    properly and, in addition, he had been particularly preoccupied in 2015
    as his sister in Bangladesh had become unwell  and  subsequently  died.
    Aspects of his evidence were explored in cross-examination. Paragraph 7
    of the decision, for example, shows that he was challenged on his claim
    that he had not been in contact with his previous  accountants  as  the
    documents provided suggested otherwise. The  First-tier  Tribunal  then
    went on in paragraphs 13 to 16  to  set  out  the  submissions  of  the
    parties.

 7. The First-tier  Tribunal  assessed  the  evidence  and  submissions  in
    paragraphs 17 to 19:

         "17. I have considered all of the evidence in  the  case  including
             that to which I  do  not  specifically  refer  and  reach  the
             following conclusions.  There is no issue over the Appellant's
             nationality, identity or  immigration  history  as  these  are
             matters accepted by the Respondent or proven by way  of  other
             documentation.  It is clear that were it not for the  problems
             with the previous  application  the  Appellant  would  clearly
             fulfil the Immigration Rules because he has been here for more
             than ten years and there have been no reasons put  forward  to
             the Respondent in relation to refusing his indefinite leave to
             remain application on the  basis  of  ten  years'  lawful  and
             continuous residence other than the false accounting returns.

         18.  The Appellant's claim that he was not aware of  this  being  a
             problem and that, effectively everything was left to Dataforce
             however, the emails to them on 23 November 2011, 5  July  2012
             and 8 July 2012 all show that he was aware that something  was
             not right.  He was getting letters from Inland  Revenue  about
             tax not being paid properly and yet he was simply passing that
             on to them and not being particularly proactive.  At the  very
             least  he  has  been  negligent  in  his  dealing   with   the
             accountants.  I am extremely surprised that someone who has  a
             business  background,  as  does  this  Appellant,  would  have
             accountants completing a blank form which has a declaration on
             it and sending it back to his accountants who,  at  the  time,
             were not being very proactive in preparing his accounts.

         19.  I have had produced to me, in the Appellant's bundle, the Home
             Office guidance on general grounds for refusal as they  relate
             to paragraph 322.  It is said there that:

                  "The main types of case you need to consider  for  refusal
                  under Paragraph 322(5) are those that involve criminality,
                  a threat to national security, war crimes or travel bans.

                  A person does  not  need  to  have  been  convicted  of  a
                  criminal  offence  for  this  provision  to  apply.   When
                  deciding whether to refuse under this  category,  the  key
                  thing to consider is if  there  is  reliable  evidence  to
                  support a decision that the person's behaviour calls  into
                  question  their  character  and/or  conduct  and/or  their
                  associations to the extent that it is undesirable to allow
                  them to enter or remain in the United Kingdom.   This  may
                  include cases where a migrant has  entered,  attempted  to
                  enter or facilitate a sham marriage to  evade  immigration
                  control."

             The Appellant argues that nothing that he did was criminal and
             that this is evidenced by the fact that not only did they  not
             take any criminal proceedings but HMRC actually did not impose
             any charges for the late payment of tax.  I  am  also  of  the
             opinion that what they  appear  to  be  showing  is  an  under
             declaration of his income which would actually mean  that  the
             points that he would have got would have been exactly the same
             had he told the truth.   Having  heard  the  evidence  of  the
             Appellant I am most concerned  about  his  behaviour  but,  on
             balance I am  not  satisfied  that  he  was  acting  with  any
             criminality and I  believe  that  he  was  nothing  more  than
             reckless in the way that he  allowed  his  accountants  a  far
             freer rein than he should have done.  I do  not  believe  that
             his failure to ensure that his correct  income  was  indicated
             can be said to call into question his character,  conduct  and
             associations and as I have previously stated  I  am  satisfied
             that there is nothing in what he has  done  that  made  him  a
             threat to national security."

 8. The respondent's grounds of appeal essentially argued that the ratio of
    the case of R (on the application of Khan) v Secretary of State for the
    Home Department (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018]  UKUT
    00384, in particular paragraphs (iv) and (v) of the head  not  had  not
    been properly applied by the  First-Tier  Tribunal.   These  paragraphs
    state::

         "(iv)    For an Applicant simply to blame his or her accountant for
             an "error" in relation to the historical tax return  will  not
             be the end of the matter, given that the  accountant  will  or
             should have asked the tax payer to confirm that the return was
             accurate and to have signed the tax return.   Furthermore  the
             Applicant will have known of his or her earnings and will have
             expected to pay tax thereon.  If the Applicant does  not  take
             steps within a reasonable time to remedy  the  situation,  the
             Secretary of State  may  be  entitled  to  conclude  that  his
             failure justifies a conclusion that there has been  deceit  or
             dishonesty.

         (v)  When considering whether or not the Applicant is dishonest  or
             merely careless the Secretary of  State  should  consider  the
             following matters, inter alia, as well as the extent to  which
             they are evidenced (as opposed to asserted):

             i.   Whether the explanation for the error by  the  accountant
                  is plausible;

             ii   Whether the documentation which can be assumed  to  exist
                  (for example, correspondence between the Applicant and his
                  accountant at  the  time  of  the  tax  return)  has  been
                  disclosed or there is a plausible explanation for  why  it
                  is missing;

             iii  Why the Applicant did not realise that an error had  been
                  made because his liability to pay tax  was  less  than  he
                  should have expected;

             iv   Whether, at any stage, the Applicant has taken  steps  to
                  remedy the situation and, if so,  when  those  steps  were
                  taken and the explanation for any significant delay."

 9. It was also submitted that HMRC not imposing a charge for late  payment
    was not a matter on which the judge was entitled to place  weight  with
    reference made to the cases of R (on the application of Samant) v  SSHD
    [2017] UKAIT UR JR/656/2016 and Abbasi JR/13807/2016.

10. In our judgment, the First-tier Tribunal judge was unarguably aware  of
    the correct assessment that he had to make, whether the  appellant  had
    been dishonest in his declarations of  income  to  HMRC  and  the  Home
    Office or merely  careless.  The  appellant's  oral  evidence  and  the
    submissions made  to  the  judge  reflect  the  principles  which  were
    subsequently approved in  Khan,  for  example,  the  role  of  previous
    accountants and a  delay  in  remedying  incorrect  declarations.   The
    decision shows that the judge was aware of the need to examine, and not
    merely accept, the appellant's claim that his previous accountants had,
    to some extent, been responsible for the  incorrect  tax  declarations.
    The appellant gave evidence on this and was  questioned  further  about
    it; see paragraphs 6, 7 and 9 of the decision. The judge considers  the
    appellant's evidence on his dealings with his previous  accountants  in
    paragraph 18 and takes into account the weaknesses  in  that  evidence.
    The same paragraph indicates that the judge also took into account  the
    evidence on the delay in remedying the incorrect  declarations.  Having
    done so, on the materials here it is not our view that he  was  obliged
    to make a finding of dishonesty, even if the  appellant's  explanations
    were not of the strongest. Our judgment is that the First-tier Tribunal
    was entitled to conclude that the appellant had been careless to a high
    degree but had not acted so as to come within  paragraph  322(5).  That
    was additionally so where the  judge  was  well-placed  to  assess  the
    appellant's credibility after hearing from him in person.

11. The Upper Tribunal cases relied upon by the respondent in  the  grounds
    concerning the weight to be placed in an assessment  such  as  this  on
    HMRC not imposing late payment  charges  or  other  sanctions  are  not
    reported and were not binding on the First-tier Tribunal. In any event,
    in our view this  was  not  a  significant  factor  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal reasoning as to why the appellant had not been  dishonest.  We
    did not find this part of the respondent's case had merit, therefore.

12. For these reasons, we did not find that the  grounds  showed  that  the
    decision of the First-tier Tribunal contained errors of law.

Notice of Decision

13. The decision of the First-tier Tribunal does not disclose an error on a
    point of law and shall stand.
