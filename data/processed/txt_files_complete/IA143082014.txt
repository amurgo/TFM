Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Holt, Counsel, instructed by Kabir Ahmed & Co
For the Respondent:    Mr Harrison (Home Office Presenting Officer)


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

         1. The Appellant, citizen of Pakistan, was born on August 24, 1984.
            He entered the United Kingdom on July 16, 2005  as  a  dependant
            child of airline staff belonging to an overseas airline. He  was
            given leave to remain until May 4, 2008. This  leave  was  later
            extended on two occasions until April 30,  2009.  On  April  29,
            2009 he was included  as  a  dependant  child  on  his  father's
            application for leave to remain as a Tier 2 migrant and  he  was
            granted leave to remain until July 20, 2010.   He  then  applied
            for a certificate of approval to marry and on August 26, 2010 he
            was granted a certificate valid until May 27, 2011. On  November
            2, 2010 he married Bernita Williams, date  of  birth  April  19,
            1966, and on November 13, 2010 he applied for leave to remain as
            the spouse of  a  person  present  and  settled  in  the  United
            Kingdom. He was granted leave to remain until February 23,  2013
            and on  February  1,  2013  he  submitted  his  application  for
            indefinite leave to remain  as  a  spouse  and  he  attended  an
            interview, as did his wife, on December 11, 2013. The respondent
            refused his application on March 10, 2014 and at the  same  time
            issued  directions  to  remove  him  under  section  47  of  the
            immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006.

         2. On March 24, 2014  the  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier
            Tribunal under Section 82(1) Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
            Act 2002 (hereinafter called the  2002  Act),  as  amended.  The
            matter came before Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Mark-Bell
            (hereinafter called "the FtTJ") on June 2, 2014 and he dismissed
            the appeal after an oral hearing in a determination  promulgated
            on June 16, 2014.

         3. The Appellant lodged grounds of appeal  on  June  24,  2014.  He
            argued the FtTJ had materially erred by  failing  to  take  into
            account  the  appellant   and   sponsor's   written   and   oral
            explanations  for  the  discrepancies   in   their   interviews.
            Permission to appeal was granted  by  Judge  of  the  First-tier
            Tribunal Denson on July 3, 2014 because he found it arguable the
            FtTJ had failed to have regard to this evidence  when  assessing
            the evidence about whether the marriage was subsisting.  A  Rule
            24 letter dated July 14, 2014 was filed in which the  respondent
            asserted the FtTJ had  referred  to  all  the  evidence  in  his
            determination.

         4. The matter came before me on the date  set  out  above  and  the
            appellant was in attendance.

         5. Mr Holt relied  on  the  grounds  submitted  and  in  particular
            submitted the FtTJ had failed to consider  the  evidence  fully.
            There  was  no  evidence  that  the  FtTJ  had  considered   the
            appellant's statement and in his assessment of their marriage he
            failed to have regard to their  statements  in  which  they  had
            addressed the concerns raised in the refusal letter.

         6. Mr Harrison indicated that he  accepted  the  determination  was
            brief and there was nothing in the determination that  indicated
            the FtTJ had had regard to their witness statement  with  regard
            to the discrepancies.  The  FtTJ  identified  discrepancies  but
            failed to demonstrate he had considered, in  his  determination,
            their explanations. He expressed difficulty  in  supporting  the
            determination.


ASSESSMENT OF ERROR OF LAW

         7. The determination was brief but this  does  not  mean  there  is
            automatically an error. However, what is clear is that the  FtTJ
            rejected the appellant's account and  highlighted  a  number  of
            inconsistencies in the evidence. The  appellant  has  submitted,
            through Mr Holt, that these discrepancies were addressed  and  I
            am satisfied that if the FtTJ had dealt with this  evidence  but
            still reached the same conclusion then  the  decision  may  well
            have been sustainable.

         8. Paragraphs [6], [10], [11]-[13], [15] -[16] of the determination
            address the evidence but the FtTJ failed to demonstrate  he  had
            taken  into  account  the  appellant   and   sponsor's   witness
            statements. These in particular address the areas of concern and
            any assessment on their relationship  should  have  included  an
            assessment of this evidence.

         9. In the circumstances I find there is a material error in law.

        10. Having established there  was  an  error  in  law  I  asked  the
            representatives whether they had any strong views on  where  the
            case should next be heard. I had in mind at this point  Part  3,
            Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement. They  agreed  this
            case should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal  because  any
            judge would have to hear the evidence afresh and make findings.

        11. Part 3, Section 7.1 to 7.3 of the Practice Statement states:

      "Where under section 12(1) of the Tribunals,  Courts  and  Enforcement
      Act 2007 (proceedings on appeal  to  the  Upper  Tribunal)  the  Upper
      Tribunal finds that the making of the decision concerned involved  the
      making of an error on a point of law, the Upper Tribunal may set aside
      the decision and, if it does so, must either remit  the  case  to  the
      First-tier  Tribunal  under  section  12(2)(b)(i)   or   proceed   (in
      accordance with relevant Practice Directions) to re-make the  decision
      under section 12(2)(b)(ii).


      The Upper Tribunal is likely on each such occasion to proceed  to  re-
      make the decision, instead of remitting the  case  to  the  First-tier
      Tribunal, unless the Upper Tribunal is satisfied that:ï¿½


      a) the effect of the error has been to  deprive  a  party  before  the
         First-tier Tribunal of a fair hearing or other opportunity for that
         party's case  to  be  put  to  and  considered  by  the  First-tier
         Tribunal; or


      b) the nature  or  extent  of  any  judicial  fact  finding  which  is
         necessary in order for the decision in the appeal to be re-made  is
         such that, having regard to the overriding objective in rule 2,  it
         is appropriate to remit the case to the First-tier Tribunal.

         Remaking rather than remitting  will  nevertheless  constitute  the
         normal approach to determining appeals where an  error  of  law  is
         found, even if some further fact finding is necessary."


        12. In light of the reason for the error in law I was satisfied this
            was a case that should be returned to the  First-tier  Tribunal.
            Subject to my availability the case will be heard before me.

        13. I made the following directions:

 i. The case will be listed for a two-hour oral hearing at  the  Manchester
    Hearing Centre on December 2, 2014.


ii. The appellant's  representatives  must  file  and  serve  on  both  the
    Tribunal and respondent any additional evidence that is to be relied on
    by November 21, 2014. The Tribunal already has a bundle dated  May  27,
    2014 consisting of 250 pages.

Decision

        14. The making of  the  decision  of  the  First-tier  Tribunal  did
            involve the making of an error on a point of  law.  I  have  set
            aside the decision.

        15. The appeal is remitted back to the  First-tier  Tribunal  for  a
            fresh appeal hearing under Section 12 of the  Tribunals,  Courts
            and Enforcement Act 2007.
