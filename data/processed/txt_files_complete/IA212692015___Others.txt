                            DECISION AND REASONS

The Appellants

1.   The Appellants are all citizens of India.  The First Appellant to  whom
    I shall refer as the Appellant was  born  on  31st  August  1971.   The
    Second Appellant his wife, who I shall refer to as Mrs Patel, was  born
    on 11th August 1973.  The Third and Fourth Appellants are the  couple's
    children.  D was born on 5th October  2000  and  K  was  born  on  14th
    November 2003.  The Appellants appeal against a decision  of  Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Sangha promulgated on 20th August 2015 in which
    he dismissed their appeal against decisions  of  the  Respondent  dated
    18th May  2015.    Those  decisions  were  to  refuse  the  Appellants'
    applications for leave to remain in the  United  Kingdom  made  on  the
    basis that refusal would be a  breach  of  this  country's  obligations
    under Article 8 (right to respect for private and family life)  of  the
    Human Rights  Convention  and  to  remove  the  Appellants  by  way  of
    directions under Section 10 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.

2.   The Appellant entered the United Kingdom with a Tier 4 Student visa  on
    14th May 2010 valid until 30th January 2012.  He was granted  leave  to
    remain in this capacity for a further period from 6th September 2012 to
    28th June 2014 but his leave to remain was curtailed  on  30th  January
    2014.  He was then granted further leave to remain as a Tier 4  Student
    for the period 19th May 2014 to  24th  June  2015.   Subsequently  that
    leave   to remain was curtailed to 6th February 2015.  Mrs Patel, D and
    K are all dependants on his appeal.

The Application for Leave

3.   On 4th February 2015 the Appellant applied for leave to remain  in  the
    United Kingdom under Article 8 on the basis of the family life  of  the
    Appellant and Mrs Patel under the ten year lawful residence  route  and
    their private life pursuant to  paragraph  276ADE  of  the  Immigration
    Rules.  The reason why the Appellant's leave had been curtailed  so  as
    to expire on 6th February 2015 was because the licence of  his  college
    had been revoked.  The Appellants were all living together as a  single
    family unit and the children of the family  had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom continuously for at least five years preceding the date of  the
    application.  The Appellant and Mrs Patel had a genuine and  subsisting
    parental relationship with the children who  had  completely  forgotten
    what it was like to live in India.  They had grown accustomed to living
    in the United Kingdom.  They could only speak broken Gujarati and  they
    had established a network of friends in the United Kingdom  which  they
    considered to be their home.  It would be unreasonable  to  expect  the
    children to leave the United Kingdom and it would be a breach  of  both
    the Immigration Rules as well as Article 8.

The Explanation for Refusal

4.   The  Respondent  considered  that  the  Appellants  did  not  meet  the
    requirements of Appendix FM of the Immigration Rules.  Mrs Patel was in
    the United Kingdom with only limited leave to remain and the  Appellant
    could not therefore  succeed  under  the  partner  route.   Whilst  the
    Appellant and Mrs Patel had a genuine and subsisting  relationship  the
    application fell for refusal under the eligibility requirements of  the
    Rules which were mandatory  and  thus  they  could  not  succeed  under
    Section EX1 of Appendix FM.

5.   The children were citizens of India but had  not  been  in  the  United
    Kingdom for at least seven years.  Whilst the Appellant and  Mrs  Patel
    were in a genuine  and  subsisting  parental  relationship  with  their
    children their application under this  section  too  fell  for  refusal
    under the eligibility requirements of the Rules which were mandatory.

6.   The Respondent considered the applications  under  Article  8.  At  the
    date of application the Appellant had lived in the United  Kingdom  for
    four years and thus could not succeed under  paragraph  276ADE  of  the
    Rules as he had not lived continuously in this  country  for  at  least
    twenty years.  There would not be very  significant  obstacles  to  the
    Appellants' integration into India if they were required to  leave  the
    United Kingdom.  The Appellant had spent 38 years of his life there and
    it was not accepted that he  would  have  since  lost  all  social  and
    cultural ties.  There were no exceptional circumstances  to  warrant  a
    grant of leave to remain outside the Rules.

7.   The Respondent considered her duty under Section  55  of  the  Borders,
    Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.  The children had been living  in
    the United Kingdom for three years but the adults would be returning to
    India with their children and would be  able  to  support  them  there.
    Whilst the children were currently enrolled in education it  was  clear
    from the objective information available that India had  a  functioning
    education system which the  children  would  be  able  to  enter.   The
    Appellants would be able to maintain their children in India.   It  was
    reasonable to expect the family to return as a  unit  and  continue  to
    enjoy their family life together in India.  Whilst that may  involve  a
    degree of disruption it was proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued
    in this instance.

8.   The Appellants appealed against the Respondent's decision on form IAFT-
    1 which was received by the Tribunal on 2nd  June  2015.   No  fee  was
    submitted with the application. The Appellant had  ticked  the  box  on
    page 4 to indicate that he wished to have his  appeal  decided  on  the
    papers.  The Tribunal wrote to each Appellant on  form  IA201  on  10th
    June 2015 stating that each Appellant must pay �80  in  order  for  the
    appeal to proceed.  The Appellant duly paid for each of the  Appellants
    to have a paper hearing and the Tribunal sent out a notice on 9th  July
    2015 to indicate that he must send any written evidence and submissions
    to the Tribunal and the Respondent by 13th August 2015.

9.   The Appellant states that he sent a letter by fax to  the  Tribunal  on
    7th August 2015 seeking  an  oral  hearing  and  offering  to  pay  the
    additional fee.  He has produced a copy of his letter which appears  to
    show that it was faxed on that  date  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal  at
    Birmingham.  The Tribunal has no  record  of  having  received  such  a
    letter.

10.  The matter was listed before Judge Sangha at Birmingham on 20th  August
    2015  as  a  paper  case.   The  Judge  had  evidently  not  seen   any
    correspondence  from  the  Appellant  requesting  an  oral  hearing  or
    otherwise.  At paragraphs 13 to 21 the Judge gave his  reasons  why  he
    dismissed the appeal.  The Appellants could not succeed under the Rules
    and the Judge accepted the reasons given by the Respondent  as  to  why
    the  application  failed.   It  was  reasonable  to  expect  the  adult
    Appellants and their children to return to India as a family  unit  and
    continue to enjoy their family life together there.

The Onward Appeal

11.   The  Appellants  appealed  against  that  decision  arguing  that  the
    Appellant had requested an oral hearing so  that  he  could  make  oral
    submissions and raise human rights  arguments  as  to  why  his  appeal
    should be allowed.  The Tribunal had ignored his fax and had not passed
    that request on to the Judge leading the Judge to conclude the  hearing
    without oral submissions.

12.  The application for permission to appeal  came  on  the  papers  before
    Judge of the First-tier  Tribunal  Adio  on  30th  December  2015.   In
    refusing permission to appeal he wrote that the Judge  had  dealt  with
    the matter on the evidence before him.  The  Judge  would  have  needed
    compelling circumstances to justify an assessment of Article 8  outside
    the Rules but the Appellant had shown no such compelling  circumstances
    at the time the matter was decided.  The Judge's decision was sound and
    supported by evidence.

13.  Judge Adio rejected the Appellant's complaint that the proceedings  had
    been unfair stating that the Appellant had the option of making further
    submissions in writing.  The Judge could  not  have  proceeded  in  any
    other way than deciding the matter on the papers.  That  the  Appellant
    had changed his mind and made a late request for an  oral  hearing  did
    not make the Judge's decision contrary to Article 6 of the Human Rights
    Convention.  At the time of Judge Sangha's decision the  Appellant  had
    only paid for a paper hearing.

14.  The Appellant renewed his onward appeal to the Upper Tribunal where  it
    came before Upper Tribunal Judge Macleman on  25th  January  2016.   In
    granting permission to appeal he found it arguable that there may  have
    been an administrative failure to link the request from  the  Appellant
    for an oral hearing to the file before the Judge.   Such  a  procedural
    mishap may amount constructively to an error of law.  He concluded:

         "The rest of the applicant's grounds seek to  show  rather  vaguely
         that they had some case for leave to remain based on Article  8  of
         the ECHR, outside the requirements of the Immigration Rules.   They
         should be aware that this grant of  permission  is  on  grounds  of
         possible  procedural  breakdown  not  on  their  having  shown  any
         substantial merit in their case".

The Error of Law Hearing before Me

15.  After hearing brief submissions I indicated to the parties  that  there
    was an error of law in Judge Sangha's determination such that  it  fell
    to be set aside.  The Appellant had made an application to  change  his
    appeal from being decided on the papers to being decided orally.   That
    application should have been in front of the trial Judge.   Through  no
    fault of his own the Judge proceeded to deal with  the  matter  without
    dealing with that application.  It would have been open  to  the  Judge
    all other  things  being  equal,  to  have  found  that  there  was  no
    justification in the Appellant's request for an oral hearing.  As Judge
    Adio pointed out the application for an oral hearing was made very late
    in  the  day  and  the  Appellant  had  the   opportunity   to   submit
    documentation.  However the application was not considered by the Judge
    because he was not aware of it and in consequence I  found  that  there
    was a procedural error such that the decision at first instance fell to
    be set aside and the appeal reheard.

16.  I considered where the appeal should be reheard.  I bore  in  mind  the
    Senior President's guidance but did  not  consider  that  this  was  an
    appropriate case to remit back to the First-tier since the issues  were
    relatively  straightforward  and  there  would  not  be  a   need   for
    substantial findings of fact.  I therefore indicated  that  the  matter
    should proceed as a rehearing.  The Appellant indicated that  he  would
    need the services of a court appointed Gujarati interpreter  and  there
    was a short delay whilst a suitable interpreter was found and  attended
    court to interpret.  The matter thereafter proceeded.

The Substantive Rehearing

17.  The Appellant attended and gave oral  testimony  adopting  his  witness
    statement dated 25th February 2016 in which he gave an account  of  his
    immigration history.  His daughter D was now 16 years of age and K  his
    son was 13 years of age.   They  were  being  educated  in  the  United
    Kingdom.  It would be unreasonable to expect either child to return  to
    India as they had strong ties within the community here.  D  was  under
    medical treatment for grommet surgery and an adenoidectomy.  This would
    cause her some pain and discomfort  after  the  surgery  when  it  took
    place.  Both children were doing well with their  studies.   Mrs  Patel
    had had to have ankle  surgery.   The  family  had  lived  without  any
    recourse to public funds.  As a result of living in the United  Kingdom
    for a continuous period of  five  years  the  Appellant  had  lost  all
    contact and ties with India and it would be very difficult for  him  to
    adjust to life in India after so  many  years.   At  paragraph  20  the
    statement rather curiously referred to only one child being brought  up
    by the Appellant and Mrs Patel and stated that  if  the  Appellant  was
    returned to India on his own his absence would deeply affect  "my  wife
    and our child".  The statement continued that the Respondent's decision
    was not in accordance with the law as  the  Respondent  had  failed  to
    apply its published policy.  The statement did not  elucidate  on  what
    this policy was. The Appellant  also  produced  a  largely  unpaginated
    bundle which contained documents common to  the  Respondent's  file  as
    well as utility bills,  a  tenancy  agreement,  medical  documentation,
    educational documents and a P60 for the tax year to 5th April 2015  for
    Mrs Patel showing that she earned �12,695.78 for that year.

18.  In oral evidence he said that it would take up to a year or  two  years
    for his daughter's ear problems to resolve.  She had  appointments  for
    check-ups.  It would be a big problem if the family returned  to  India
    because his daughter had had the same doctor for the last  year  and  a
    half.  She would have a permanent problem throughout her life with  her
    hearing.  D was at Stratford Academy in Year 10 doing the first year of
    her GCSE exams which would be in September 2018.  It  was  a  two  year
    course.  Removal to India would impact upon those studies.  He and  his
    wife placed great importance on their daughter's studies.   The  Indian
    educational system  was  quite  different  to  the  UK  system.   Their
    academic year started at a different time of the year in May as opposed
    to September.  If the family were sent back  his  daughter  would  lose
    another academic year.  Teaching methods were very different.

19.  When his son K came to this country he was in Year 3 and had a  lot  of
    trouble but now his English is very good.  If he went back it would  be
    difficult to start all over  again  educationally.   Mrs  Patel  had  a
    problem in both legs with walking and a lot of pain around  the  ankle.
    She had had x-rays.  She had undergone an operation  on  22nd  February
    when a small plate had been inserted in her ankle.  The plaster had now
    been removed.  If she went back to India she would have to be diagnosed
    all over again.  His wife worked for Unique Personal Care as a personal
    carer.  She had been working about three and a half years. He would not
    be able to readjust to life in India.  He had been self-employed  there
    as a businessman for fifteen years.  After winding up his  business  he
    came to the United Kingdom and since then had been here  for  the  last
    five to six years.  It would be very difficult to start all over again.



20.  In cross-examination  he  accepted  that  his  wife  and  children  had
    arrived in the United Kingdom on 30th July 2011.  When he came to  this
    country he was intending to study for his MBA and then apply for a work
    visa but after finishing his degree he was not able to do either so  he
    applied again as a student.  After that application he decided  he  did
    not want to stay in the United Kingdom illegally as by  that  time  the
    children had enrolled in the educational  system.   It  had  originally
    been his intention to return to India  but  because  of  how  well  the
    children were doing in their education he had decided to stay here.

21.  Once he had come to the United Kingdom he did not keep  in  touch  with
    anyone in India.  Now it was difficult to keep in touch.  He  had  been
    quite busy when he first arrived in the United Kingdom.  When  he  left
    India there were some family issues which meant it was not possible  to
    keep contact.  He had been living in a joint family  with  his  brother
    and their parents  and  there  had  been  family  arguments  especially
    between the women in the household.  It was affecting his children  and
    their education so they decided to come here.

Closing Submissions

22.  For the Respondent it was  submitted  that  the  Appellants  could  not
    satisfy the Immigration  Rules.   EX1  of  Appendix  FM  could  not  be
    satisfied as neither of the children had been here for at  least  seven
    years or were British citizens not even by  the  date  of  the  hearing
    today.  For the Appellants to  succeed  in  a  freestanding  Article  8
    application there must be compelling circumstances but there were  none
    in this  case.   The  wife's  and  daughter's  medical  conditions  had
    resulted in their being treated at  public  expense.   The  Appellant's
    daughter had only been excused  from  going  to  school  for  ten  days
    following her treatment.  Mrs Patel might or might not require  further
    surgery but there were no complicating  circumstances.   There  was  no
    evidence that  medical  facilities  were  unavailable  in  India.   The
    private life of the parties was entered into when the Appellant's leave
    was precarious.  Financial independence did not count in favour of  the
    Appellants.  The Appellant's wife was working but the Appellant himself
    had no right to work and it was not at all  clear  how  Mrs  Patel  was
    entitled to work.  Mrs Patel had worked up until her operation on  22nd
    February.  The Appellant had only been here for five years so it  could
    not be right that he had lost all  ties  to  India.  There  had  to  be
    significant obstacles to reintegration.  The  Appellant  had  lived  in
    India for little short of 40 years so there were no such obstacles.

23.  In conclusion for the Appellant it was argued that the  refusal  letter
    was defective because the Respondent had  not  addressed  a  number  of
    documents which the Appellant had submitted with his application.  They
    related to the children's education.  This was a freestanding Article 8
    application but there  were  compelling  reasons.   The  children  were
    studying here and had medical issues.  The Respondent had not  properly
    considered the daughter's medical position.   If  asked  the  Appellant
    would  have  provided  further  documents.   It  would  be  harsh   and
    disproportionate to remove D before her treatment was  completed.   The
    Appellant's bundle contained documents about the children's  education.
    D was doing well with her GCSEs due to be completed in 2018.  It  would
    be difficult for the children to readjust.   The  documents  had  shown
    that the Appellant's son was also doing very well at school.  Mrs Patel
    had problems with both of her ankles.  She had had one operation on one
    ankle and she would need another operation on the other leg.  She would
    be deprived of this treatment if the family were removed.

24.  The treatment by the Respondent in  the  refusal  letter  of  her  duty
    under Section 55 was inadequate.  The Appellant had  properly  informed
    the Respondent of the facts but there was no mention  of  for  example,
    the children's schools.  The duty was not fully explored or scrutinised
    in the decision making process.  There was still residual discretion to
    grant leave outside the Immigration Rules,  one  had  to  look  at  the
    medical conditions in particular.

Findings

25.  It is not argued on the part of the Appellants that they can  meet  the
    Immigration Rules in this case.  Mrs Patel is the  breadwinner  in  the
    family but she is not earning anywhere near the amount  required  under
    Appendix FM.  Although the Appellant and Mrs Patel were  in  a  genuine
    and subsisting relationship neither was a British citizen nor a  person
    present and settled in the United Kingdom and thus neither of  the  two
    adult Appellants could rely on the status of the other to  qualify  for
    leave by virtue of Section E-LTRP.1.2.  Similarly as neither adult  was
    a British citizen or settled in this  country  neither  could  rely  on
    Section EX1(b) to succeed under the Rules.

26.  In relation to the children, again it was accepted that  the  Appellant
    and Mrs Patel had a genuine and subsisting parental  relationship  with
    their children who were both under the age of 18 years and were in  the
    United Kingdom.  However neither child was a qualifying child  that  is
    to say neither was a British  citizen  nor  had  lived  in  the  United
    Kingdom continuously for at least seven years immediately preceding the
    date of application. The Appellant could not  rely  on  Section  EX1(a)
    which as the Respondent pointed out, were mandatory requirements.

27.  In relation to any claim for private life under paragraph 276ADE(1)  of
    the Immigration Rules as the Appellant had not  lived  continuously  in
    the United Kingdom for at least twenty years, was over the age  of  18,
    indeed was over the age of 25, he could not bring  himself  within  the
    provisions of that paragraph either.

28.  This meant that the application  fell  for  consideration  outside  the
    Immigration Rules.  Undoubtedly the Appellant, his  wife  and  children
    had established a family life in this  country  and  that  family  life
    would be interfered with by requiring all four Appellants to return  to
    India.  It was not intended that only the Appellant would be  returned,
    the Respondent made clear that return would be of  all  four  together.
    That interference would be in accordance with  the  legitimate  aim  of
    immigration control since the Appellant's  leave  to  remain  had  been
    curtailed on 6th February 2015 due to difficulties  with  his  college.
    The issue therefore is whether the interference  with  the  Appellant's
    private and  family  lives  is  proportionate  to  the  legitimate  aim
    pursued.

29.  The first point to note is that none of the  Appellants  in  this  case
    have been in the United  Kingdom  for  a  long  period  of  time.   The
    Appellant himself has only been in this  country  for  six  years,  his
    dependants  for  approximately  five   years.    In   considering   the
    proportionality of the Respondent's decision I must consider what is in
    the best interests of the children as their  interests  are  a  primary
    concern of the Tribunal and must be considered first.   Undoubtedly  it
    is in the best interests of the children that they should be  continued
    to be looked after by both their parents.  Furthermore it is argued  on
    their behalf that the children's medical and  educational  requirements
    are such that their best interests mean that they should remain in this
    country.

30.  D has had recourse to medical  intervention  in  this  country  but  no
    evidence beyond the assertion of the Appellant was provided  to  me  to
    indicate that such medical care as D might require would be unavailable
    in India.  Whilst I appreciate that  any  operation  on  a  child  will
    concern a parent, in this case D only  needed  to  take  ten  days  off
    school for what appears to have been a fairly routine  operation.   D's
    condition cannot be said to be  life-threatening  and  will  presumably
    respond to appropriate treatment for which I have not  been  given  any
    independent evidence that it is unavailable in  India.   The  Appellant
    may have some concerns as a parent but there is no evidence to  support
    his fears that D's treatment might in some way be adversely affected.

31.  Both children are being educated in this country and  have  been  since
    they entered the United Kingdom approximately five years ago.   In  the
    Court of Appeal decision of EV Philippines  [2014]  EWCA  Civ  874  the
    Court of Appeal considered the argument which  would  arise  where  the
    best interests of the children were that their education in the  United
    Kingdom should not be disrupted.  The  children  in  the  instant  case
    before me have settled well into their schools and have  made  progress
    as is clear from the school reports.  In  a  situation  where  as  here
    neither parent has the right to remain in  this  country  that  is  the
    background against which the assessment of the best  interests  of  the
    children is to be conducted.  The ultimate question is  whether  it  is
    reasonable to expect the children to  follow  their  parents  to  their
    country of origin.

32.  As in the case of EV Philippines none of the Appellants  in  this  case
    have the right to remain in this country.  It is entirely reasonable to
    expect the children to go with their parents.  As Lord Justice  Lewison
    put it at paragraph 60 of EV Philippines:

         "Although it is, of course a question of fact for the  Tribunal,  I
         cannot see that  the  desirability  of  being  educated  at  public
         expense in the UK can outweigh  the  benefit  to  the  children  of
         remaining with their parents.  Just as we  cannot  provide  medical
         treatment for the world, so we cannot educate the world".

    He went on at paragraph 61 to say  that  it  would  be  appropriate  to
    consider the cost  to  the  public  purse  in  providing  education  to
    children who had otherwise no right to remain in this country.

33.  In this case the Appellants cannot succeed under the Immigration  Rules
    and due weight has to be given to that conclusion.   The  children  can
    return with their parents to India, a country where they were both born
    and lived in the case of D for the first eleven years of her  life  and
    in the case of K for the first eight years of his life.  There may need
    to be some  adjustments  to  the  Indian  educational  system  but  the
    children were able to adapt to what the  Appellant  claims  is  a  very
    different educational system in this country and I see  no  reason  why
    they should not be able to similarly adapt to the educational system in
    India.  The weight to be placed on the legitimate aim being pursued  in
    this case significantly outweighs the  interests  of  the  children  to
    continue their education at  public  expense  in  this  country.   Both
    children could receive any medical treatment they may require in India.

34.  As to the adults, Mrs Patel has had  some  medical  treatment  in  this
    country but again I have seen no evidence to suggest that such  medical
    treatment is unavailable in India and I see no reason why she would not
    be able to access such treatment as she  needed  there.  The  Appellant
    himself is fit and healthy.

35.  In relation to the claim to  a  private  life,  I  do  not  accept  the
    Appellant's evidence that there are any insurmountable obstacles to him
    relocating to his country  of  origin  where  he  has  spent  the  vast
    majority of his life.  He may or  may  not  wish  to  live  with  other
    members of his extended family, that is a matter for him, but there  is
    no reason why he cannot make an independent life for himself  in  India
    as he has sought to do in this country.  Similarly Mrs Patel  has  been
    able to find employment in this country and I see  no  reason  why  she
    would be unable to seek employment in India  if  she  so  wished.   The
    private life of the Appellants in this case has been  built  up  whilst
    their status here has been precarious the  Appellant  having  only  had
    status as a student.  As such, little weight is to be ascribed to their
    private lives in the balancing exercise.  Against that  the  Appellants
    have only been in the United Kingdom a short time and none can meet the
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   It  is  proportionate  to  the
    legitimate aim being pursued that they should be removed together as  a
    family to India.  There will be no breach of this country's obligations
    under  Article  8  in  that  eventuality.   There  are  no   compelling
    circumstances in this case such that  the  appeals  should  be  allowed
    outside the Rules for the reasons which I have given above.

Notice of Decision

The decision of the First-tier Tribunal involved the making of an  error  of
law and I have set  it  aside.  I  remake  the  decision  in  this  case  by
dismissing the Appellants' appeals against the Respondent's decisions.


Appellants' appeals dismissed.


I make no anonymity order in respect of the adults as  there  is  no  public
policy reason for so doing.
