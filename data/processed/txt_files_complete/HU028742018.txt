                            DECISION AND REASONS
Introduction

   1. The appellant is a national of Nigeria. He came to the United Kingdom
      on 14 September 2007 with a student Visa, valid until 28 February
      2009. His leave was extended on various occasions.

   2. On 19 July 2017 he applied for indefinite leave to remain on the basis
      of long residence. That application was refused on 10 January 2018.His
      application was considered under paragraph 276B of the immigration
      rules which requires an applicant to have had at least 10 years
      continuous lawful residence.

   3.  The respondent contended that his lawful residence was broken between
      27 January 2011 and 21 March 2011. The respondent referred to his
      leave expiring on 27 January 2011 and that he had 28 days in which to
      submit a valid application in order for his leave to be continuous.
      His next application was made on the 21 March 2011 and leave was
      granted until 23 August 2013. Consequently, the subsequent application
      of 21 March 2011 was 52 days out of time.

   4. On 26 July 2016 he made another application for leave to remain which
      was refused on 15 May 2017. He then sought an administrative review
      and the refusal was upheld on 26 June 2017. The respondent took the
      view that his most recent application made on 19 July 2017 was out of
      time for continuous leave to be preserved.

   5. Reference was made to the appellant's article 8 rights and the section
      55 duty. At the time of decision his wife was pregnant. The decision-
      maker concluded that the refusal did not breach those rights,
      concluding only private life was engaged.

The First-tier Tribunal.

   6. The appellant's appeal was heard on 25 October 2018 at Taylor House
      before First-tier Tribunal Judge D Ross. In a decision promulgated on
      30 November 2018 it was dismissed.

   7. Regarding the 1st period in contention, 27 January 2011 and 21 March
      2011, the presenting officer accepted the decision was incorrect
      because the appellant had extant post study leave until 17 December
      2011.

   8. Relevant to 3C leave, he lodged a judicial review application
      following the refusal of his 26th July 2016 application. The
      respondent agreed to reconsider the decision but the fresh decision
      was on the same terms as the previous refusal. On 13 January 2018 the
      respondent wrote to the appellant advising that they would withdraw
      and reconsider their decision.

   9. First-tier Tribunal Judge D Ross wrote:

         "19. Looking at the published guidance on the subject of 3C leave,
         this states that the purpose of 3C leave is to prevent a person who
         makes an in-time application to extend their leave from becoming an
         over stayer while awaiting a decision on the application and while
         any appeal or administrative review their entitled to pursue is
         pending. Where a decision is withdrawn by the Secretary of State
         after 3C leave comes to an end withdrawal of the decision does not
         mean that the person once again has 3C leave. 3C leave cannot be
         resurrected. A subsequent grant of leave is treated as if the
         appellant was lawfully present in the UK in any subsequent
         application. In this case the appellant agrees that the respondent
         have made a decision on 26th of June 2017 refusing his
         administrative review. He subsequently did not make a further
         application for judicial review until 14 August 2017 he made the
         parallel application for indefinite leave to remain on 19 July
         2019.


          20.   On 7 November 2017 Upper Tribunal Judge Allen gave a
         judgement which is concerned with the application for judicial
         review in this case in which he said" The respondent has agreed to
         reconsider the decision under challenge and I consider that, even
         bearing in mind the points made in the applicant's letter of 11 of
         October, 2017, and that even if the decision of where withdrawn, if
         it is right, as it appears to be, that section 3C leave comes to an
         end on 26 of June 2017, it is clear from the respondent's policy
         that even where decision is withdrawn, section 3C leave that has
         been loss cannot be revived


          21. It is clear from this decision that the Upper Tribunal
         considered that the 3C leave and come to an end on the 26 of June
         2017, and could not be revived...


         22. I therefore consider that the appellants leave to remain
         expired on 26 May 2017 which is less than 10 years after he 1st
         entered the United Kingdom on 14 September 2007. He therefore
         cannot succeed on the basis of long residence..."


   The Upper Tribunal

  10. Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was granted on the basis it
      was arguable there was a material error in determining when his leave
      expired. The grounds argue that First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross was
      wrong in concluding the appellant's leave to remain ended on 26 June
      2017. It was argued the judge failed to properly consider the
      respondent's guidance in relation to section 3C which provides at page
      7:

         '...where a person has section 3C leave at the time a decision was
         made and that decision was withdrawn after section 3C leave has
         ended, the person should not be disadvantaged by the fact that
         their section 3C leave has ended and cannot be resurrected. This
         means that the outstanding application should be made as if the
         person still had section 3C leave...'


  11. The appellant's representatives submitted that even if the 3C leave
      was broken the appellant should not be prejudiced.

  12. A further ground related to the appellant's eldest child. At the time
      of hearing she had resided in the United Kingdom for more than 7 years
      and as such was a qualifying child. Reference was made to the decision
      of the Supreme Court in KO (Nigeria) [2018] UKSC 53.

  13. At hearing the appellant was not represented but had made some
      preparation himself for the appeal. He maintained that he had
      continuous leaves throughout and referred to delay occurring because
      the proper postage was not paid by the respondent. The presenting
      officer contended that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not err
      and that section 3C leave did not assist the appellant.

Consideration

  14. It is unfortunate that the appellant did not have legal representation
      at hearing because the question of section 3C leave was complex.

  15.  The appellant's former representatives did prepare a skeleton
      argument for the appeal sent with a covering letter dated 1 March
      2019. It refers to the review decision of 26 June 2017 maintaining the
      refusal. There was a judicial review of that decision on 14 August
      2017. On 21 September 2017 the respondent agreed to reconsider the
      decision. It is contended that in light of this Upper Tribunal Judge
      Allen refused permission in the judicial review application. However,
      on 15 December 2017 the further decision issued by the respondent
      maintained the refusal. It goes on to state on 30 January 2018 the
      appellant's administrative review succeeded.

  16. The skeleton argument refers to a letter from the respondent advising
      his existing leave and conditions were extended under section 3C.
      Reference was made to page 7 of the published guidance of 15 January
      2019. The 3rd paragraph from the bottom states that where a person has
      section 3C leave at the time a decision was made and that decision is
      withdrawn after section 3C leave has ended the person should not be
      disadvantaged. The outstanding application should be considered as if
      the person still had section 3C leave.

  17. At paragraph 19 First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross referred to the
      published guidance but does not make reference to the person being
      disadvantaged. It is my conclusion that the judge failed to factor
      this as this appears to be precisely what did happen. It also has to
      be borne in mind that the appeal is not directly under the rules but
      through the prism of the rules in assessing the proportionality of the
      decision.

  18. I turn to the section 55 obligation. The appellant's eldest child,
      Halimat, is a qualifying child. She was born on 22 September 2011 in
      the United Kingdom and is 7 years of age No separate decision was
      issued in respect of her but she forms part of the appellant's appeal
      by virtue of the respective article 8 rights. The refusal letter
      refers to the fact that none of the family are British and so cannot
      benefit from appendix FM. The claim therefore was only being
      considered in the context of private life.

  19. At hearing the appellant had produced tax records and stated he had
      been supporting himself. First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross deals with
      article 8 at paragraph 23 onwards. Again, the judge looked at matters
      in the context of private life and had regard to paragraph 276 ADE(iv)
      of the immigration rules in respect of the eldest child. The issue was
      whether it would be reasonable to expect her to leave the United
      Kingdom. The respondent's intention was to remove the family as a
      unit.

  20. The approach in the First tier was that because the family would be
      returned as a unit, family life is not engaged and the issue relates
      solely to private life. The judge accepted that the respondent's
      decision interfered with the family's private life. Into this was
      introduced the notion of this private life developing when their leave
      was precarious.

  21. The judge correctly self-directed that the best interests of the
      children was a primary consideration. The judge refers to this as
      being part of the proportionality exercise whereas in fact their best
      interests are quite distinct from this exercise.

  22. At paragraph 32 the judge refers to section 117 B (6). At paragraph 34
      the judge referred to KO (Nigeria). The judge stated there was no
      reprehensible conduct on the part of the appellant or his wife. At
      paragraph 35 the judge then pointed out that neither parent had the
      right to live in the United Kingdom. The judge found that the eldest
      child was not at a particular educational milestone and concluded it
      was entirely reasonable for her to leave with both of her parents.
      They were described as enterprising and had a long association with
      Nigeria. The conclusion was that it was in the best interests of the
      eldest child and the rest of the family to return to Nigeria.

   Conclusions

  23. The First-tier Tribunal judge was presented with a particularly
      complex decision. The judge had to consider 2 periods when it was
      asserted the appellant's leave had been broken. Added to that were
      issues about his finances. The 1st period of leave and the financial
      issue were resolved at hearing. The bulk of the hearing was directed
      to the 2nd period, when there was a query as to whether the
      appellant's leave had been broken.

  24. I find the judge failed to apply the respondent's policy in relation
      to 3C leave and the guidance at page 7 that the person should not be
      disadvantaged where there leave has ended and cannot be resurrected.
      It has to be borne in mind that on appeal the judge was not tied to
      considering whether the rules were met to the letter. The guidance
      that a person should not be prejudiced was relevant to the
      proportionality exercise.

  25. The decision in KO (Nigeria) was given on 24 October 2018. The judge
      did well to incorporate this decision in a hearing the following day.
      There has been a period since when decision makers have sought to
      apply the guidance given. There have now been subsequent decisions
      giving further guidance, recent examples being JG (S117B(6)
      `reasonable to leave the UK') [2019]UKUT 00079 and SA and others
      [2018] CSIH 7 . Having the benefit of the jurisprudence since KO
      Nigeria it is my conclusion the judge did not properly deal with the
      best interests of the children and the application of para 276(ADE(iv)
      and section 117B(6).

  26. I find the judge materially errs in consideration of the position of
      the appellant's eldest child and the reasonableness of expecting her
      to leave. There is no suggestion that the appellant did not have a
      genuine and subsisting parental relationship with his children. The
      question of reasonableness had to be viewed from the perspective of
      the child. I find this is not been adequately considered. It is of
      note that the respondent's guidance to caseworkers on this point has
      been revised since, the most recent being in February 2019. There is
      no reference to the earlier guidance in the decision

Disposal

  27. In the Upper Tribunal the bulk of the argument again related to the
      application of 3C leave. I did not have the benefit of legal
      submissions at hearing for the appellant on the technicalities of 3C.
      Given that there are further factual findings to be made in relation
      to the children it will be necessary to remake the decision to the
      First-tier Tribunal. I remit the appeal to the First-tier Tribunal for
      a de novo hearing. That hearing can consider afresh the article 8
      rights engaged, including the guidance on 3C in relation to the
      appellant and also the development in the case law in relation to
      section 117 B(6).

Decision

The decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross materially errs in law and
is set aside. The matter is remitted for a de novo hearing in the First-
tier Tribunal.


Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Farrelly


Directions

   1. Realist for a de novo hearing in the First-tier Tribunal at Taylor
      House, excluding First-tier Tribunal Judge Ross.
   2. In relation to compliance with paragraph 276B of the immigration
      rules, there had been no challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's
      finding that he came to the United Kingdom on 14 September 2007 and
      had leave until 26 June 2017. In respect of the period thereafter the
      parties should consider if he had lawful residence to complete the
      necessary 10 years either by virtue of 3C leave or whether he can
      benefit from the respondent's guidance at page 7 that he should not be
      disadvantaged.
   3. The financial details set out in paragraph 5 and 6 of the decision
      have not been challenged. An up-to-date statement in respect of the
      family finances and prospects should be prepared.
   4. The parties should consider whether in addition to private life,
      family life is engaged. There is no dispute that the appellant has a
      genuine and subsisting relationship with his children.
   5. Regard should be had to the developing case law in relation to section
      117B(6),paragraph 276 ADE(iv) and the respondent's policy of February
      2019 in respect of qualifying children.
   6. The appellant should provide details about the progress of his
      children.
   7. The appellant would benefit from legal advice.
   8. There is no need for an interpreter.
   9. A maximum hearing time of 1 � hours is anticipated.
