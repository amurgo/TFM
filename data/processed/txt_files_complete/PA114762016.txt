1. The appeal came before me for a resumed hearing on 11 September 2017. Mr
Melvin indicated that, apart from the fact that the Respondent now accepted
that the Appellant had worked at Baghram airbase, the further issues raised
in the refusal decision as to the credibility of the Appellant's account
remained at large and consequently he considered that the appeal would take
at least 2 hours, despite the fact that it had been listed for 1 and a half
hours, due to the need for extensive cross-examination.

2. In light of the fact that it was after 2pm and that two other
substantive appeals remained outstanding in the list, I considered that it
would be neither just nor fair for the appeal to proceed on what was
overwhelmingly likely to be a part heard basis and it would be better to
adjourn the appeal for a further hearing. Following submissions from Ms
Nnamani I agreed it would be more appropriate for the appeal to be remitted
back to the First tier Tribunal in order for a full hearing to be
conducted.

3. The appeal is, therefore, remitted for a further hearing before the
First tier Tribunal, to be listed on the first available date.
