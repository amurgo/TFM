               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


                                  DECISION

1.   Permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal was  granted  on  14  August
    2015 against the decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  dated  24  June
    2015.

2.   By a decision sent to the parties on 14 August 2015  the  President  of
    the First-tier Tribunal, in the light of the decision of the  Court  of
    Appeal in The Lord Chancellor v Detention Action [2015] EWCA  Civ  840,
    set aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal and directed that the
    appeal be re-determined by a Judge other than the Judge  who  made  the
    decision being set aside.

3.   Consequently it is considered that the appeal in the Upper Tribunal  is
    now academic and is dismissed.



DIRECTIONS

4.   Following my directions dated 17 August 2015,  and  the  response  from
    the appellant's solicitors, Broudie Jackson Canter  dated  1  September
    2015, the appellant's case  is  transferred  to  Manchester  (IAC)  for
    rehearing.
