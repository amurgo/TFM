                       UPPER TRIBUNAL JUDGE CLIVE LANE



                                   Between

                                NASREEN GOHAR
                                                                   Appellant

                                     and

               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT


                                                                  Respondent



                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


 1. I refer to  the  directions  dated  2  October  2012  annexed  to  this
    determination. Those directions were sent by first class  post  to  the
    appellant on 8 October 2012 to her last known  address  in  Birmingham.
    There is nothing on the file to suggest that the document did not reach
    the appellant.  The appellant has not contacted the Upper  Tribunal  in
    accordance with paragraph 3 of the directions. On 27 November 2012, the
    appellant's new representative, Gull Law Chambers, wrote to  the  Upper
    Tribunal to request that the  appeal  do  remain  adjourned  until  the
    appeal now bearing the citation Patel [2012]  EWCA  Civ  741  had  been
    concluded.  The request is unclear given that  the  Court  of  Appeal's
    judgment had been delivered on 1  June  2012.   No  reasons  have  been
    offered by the appellant or  her  representative  explaining  why  this
    appeal should not be dismissed and, by reference to paragraph 3 of  the
    direction of 2 October 2012, I now dismiss it.





Conclusions

The making of the decision  of the First-tier Tribunal did not  involve  the
making of an error on a point of law.

This appeal is dismissed.
