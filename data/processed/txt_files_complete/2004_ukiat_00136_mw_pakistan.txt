Representation:

For the appellant:           Mr  S  Khan,  counsel  instructed  by  HSK
Solicitors, Manchester
For the respondent:          Mr J Wyatt

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

   This is a Home Office appeal from the decision of an adjudicator, Mr J S
   Law, sitting at Manchester on 14 August 2003, allowing  on  both  asylum
   and human rights grounds an appeal by someone who claims to be a citizen
   of Afghanistan; but who the Home Office said was a citizen of  Pakistan.
   They said so on the basis that he arrived on a Pakistani passport, which
   was later examined by the Immigration and Nationality Department Forgery
   Section and found to be apparently genuine.  The  appellant's  case  was
   that this passport had been frauduently obtained for him  by  an  agent,
   and was not genuine at all, as he never had been a citizen of  Pakistan.
   For good measure the appellant after his arrival here went to the Afghan
   Embassy and got himself an Afghan passport.

2. The adjudicator dealt with the claimant's history and a video  which  he
   produced and went on at paragraph 18:

   The respondent had produced no clear evidence substantiating  the  claim
   that the passport  under  which  the  appellant  travelled  was  genuine
   therefore giving rise to the claim that he was from  Pakistan.   We  are
   always directed with regard to  being  careful  on  considering  experts
   evidence advices but in this particular case no evidence was provided to
   substantiate the main claim. The fact that he travelled on  a  Pakistani
   passport I believe does not indicate that he is a Pakistani national  if
   he placed himself into the hands of an agent  upon  whose  expertise  in
   claiming asylum.  Whilst in the United Kingdom the appellant has been to
   attend the consulate of Afghanistan  and  there  obtain  an  Afghanistan
   passport having clearly satisfied the authorities of his  rights  so  to
   obtain such passport.  This being  case  and  on  the  totality  of  the
   evidence made available I find that the appellant was born  and  brought
   up in Afghanistan and the rest of my determination is  based  upon  that
   fact.


3. The Home Office challenged those findings in their grounds of appeal  on
   the basis that the adjudicator was bound to accept the forgery  reports.
    That cannot of course be right.  It must be said that  the  adjudicator
   gave very little in the way of reasons for not accepting them.  However,
   the reports themselves were fairly short of reasons. On the  other  hand
   what the passage we have just set out does show is that the  adjudicator
   in effect reversed the burden of proof on this point.  Possession of  an
   apparently genuine national passport must raise an  inference  that  the
   holder possesses that nationality, and it is for him to rebut  that,  if
   he wishes.

4. Mr Khan has argued that the claimant had rebutted any  such  presumption
   to the satisfaction of the  adjudicator;  but  we  return  to  what  the
   adjudicator actually said: "But in this particular case no evidence  was
   provided to substantiate the main  claim.  Really  the  adjudicator  was
   regarding  failure  to  produce  any  further  evidence  to   show   the
   genuineness of the passport by the Home Office as a  most,  if  not  the
   most important factor on this issue.   That must amount to a mistake  of
   law, and who knows what the adjudicator might have decided on this point
   if he had applied the correct burden of proof?  On this point alone  the
   appeal would in any event have to be allowed, and in that case  a  fresh
   hearing would have been directed.

5. However, there is a more fundamental objection to the result reached  by
   the adjudicator, which we pointed out at the  hearing,  although  it  is
   quite apparent on the face of his decision, in the passage we  have  set
   out.  What was the effect of this claimant getting  an  Afghan  passport
   after arriving in this country?  International law on this point is  set
   out in the Refugee Convention, article 1 C(1):

      This Convention shall cease to apply to any person falling out of  the
   terms of Section A if;

      (1) he has voluntarily re-availed himself of  the  protection  of  the
   country of his nationality.

6. That is explained in the UNCHR Handbook at paragraph 121:

      In determining whether Refugee status is lost in  these  circumstances
   a distinction should be drawn between actual re-availment of  protection
   and occasional and incidental contacts with  the  national  authorities.
   If a refugee applies for and obtains a national passport or  is  renewal
   it will in the absence of proof to the  contrary  be  presumed  that  he
   intends to avail himself  of  the  protection  of  the  country  of  his
   nationality.  On the other hand, the acquisition of documents  from  the
   national authorities for which non  nationals  would  likewise  have  to
   apply such a birth or marriage certificate, or similar  services  cannot
   be regarded as a re-availment of protection.

7. Some exceptions are made to that rule.   Paragraph 120 refers  to  cases
   where the person concerned is instructed to obtain a  national  passport
   by the authorities of his country of refuge, or where he is  obliged  to
   do so by circumstances beyond his control; and paragraph 121, as we have
   already seen, makes an exception for documents which are not  passports,
   and so not exclusive to nationals of the country in question.   However,
   this was a regular Afghan passport.

8. There may not be much in the way of formalities required to obtain  such
   a document.   As we saw from paragraph 6.231 of the  October  2003  CIPU
   report, to which our attention was drawn by Mr Wyatt:

      The Minister of  Interior  stated  there  are  no  fixed  in  what  is
   required to obtain a passport or an ID card and no specific  papers  are
   required to obtain a passport.

9. Mr Khan has argued  that  the  claimant  had  been  complaining  to  the
   adjudicator all along of lack of protection by the  Afghan  authorities,
   which the  adjudicator  had  apparently  accepted.    But  even  if  the
   adjudicator had been right to find  that  the  claimant  was  an  Afghan
   national, this was a clear case of someone getting a  national  passport
   voluntarily for his own purposes, and there is nothing in the  facts  of
   the case to show that  he  did  not  intend  to  avail  himself  of  the
   protection of the Afghan authorities.

10. Here  that  process  may  have  amounted  only  to  getting  the  Afghan
   authorities to accept him as a citizen and to certify him as  such,  for
   what that was worth on the evidence  referred  to  at  8.   However,  it
   clearly falls within the principles of article 1 C(1), as  explained  in
   paragraph 121 of the Handbook.   This was  a  point  of  law  which  was
   obvious on the basis of the adjudicator's decision.  In our  view  there
   is no reason why the principle of re-availment  of  national  protection
   should not apply to the human rights grounds as to the asylum ones,  and
   even this point does not appear to have been noticed by the Home  Office
   in drafting their grounds of appeal, it must result in that appeal being
   allowed.
