                                                                   Appellant

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr. N. Adojutelegan, Natado Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Deller, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1. Following the decision promulgated on 27 April  2017  in  which  I  set
     aside the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, the appeal  came  before
     me to be remade.


  2. I heard oral evidence from the Appellant and from his wife Mrs.  Rafiat
     Orija.  Both representatives made oral submissions.


  3. I have also taken into account the documents in the Appellant's  bundle
     from the First-tier Tribunal (103 pages), the supplemental bundle  (176
     pages), and excerpts from the Country of Origin Information Report  and
     other background  evidence  provided  in  an  11  page  bundle  by  Mr.
     Adojutelegan at the hearing.


  4. It was agreed at the hearing that the matters before  me  were  whether
     the Appellant met the requirements of paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi)  of  the
     immigration rules or,  in  the  alternative,  whether  the  Appellant's
     appeal fell to be allowed  under  Article  8  outside  the  immigration
     rules.


Findings and Decision


  5. I found the Appellant and his wife to be honest and credible  witnesses
     who answered all questions put to them and  were  not  evasive.   Their
     evidence was internally consistent and consistent with the  documentary
     evidence provided.  I find that their evidence can be relied on.


Paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)


  6. I have taken into account the previous judgment  of  Immigration  Judge
     Morgan promulgated on 9 April 2009 (pages 36 to 42 of  the  Appellant's
     bundle).  I have also taken into account the decision of Upper Tribunal
     Judge Kopieczek in relation to the judicial review of a decision  dated
     15 March 2013.  This was provided in the supplemental bundle,  and  was
     in the Respondent's bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.


  7. Judge Morgan made findings as to the Appellant's ties to  Nigeria  [10]
     and [11].  He found the Appellant to be credible [10] and the  evidence
     was accepted  in  its  entirety.   He  found  that  the  Appellant  was
     abandoned by his aunt in the United Kingdom [11].   The  Appellant  had
     been living with this aunt in Nigeria  having  been  abandoned  by  his
     mother as a child.  His father had a mental disability and neither  the
     Appellant nor his brother  had  ever  lived  with  their  father.   The
     Appellant had had no contact with the aunt who had abandoned him in the
     United Kingdom since 2004.  She was the only family he had in  Nigeria.
     He had no contact with his family in Nigeria.


  8. This evidence is referred to in the  decision  of  UTJ  Kopieczek.   He
     found that it was arguable that the Respondent had  acted  irrationally
     in not  considering  the  findings  made  by  the  First-tier  Tribunal
     relating to the Appellant's  history  and  arguable  lack  of  ties  to
     Nigeria.  He found that these findings were relevant to the question of
     "no ties" under paragraph 276ADE(vi) of the immigration rules.  At  the
     time of this decision in 2013, paragraph  276ADE(vi)  referred  to  the
     ties that an individual had with his country of origin.  UTJ  Kopieczek
     found that the Respondent had erred in  not  taking  into  account  the
     findings in the 2009 decision.


  9. I have taken into account the case  of  Devaseelan.   The  findings  of
     Judge Morgan were not referred to in the  decision  of  the  First-tier
     Tribunal which I set aside.  These findings have not  been  challenged.
     While I accept that the wording of  paragraph  276ADE(vi)  has  changed
     since it was considered by UTJ Kopieczek, the findings relating to  the
     Appellant's lack of ties to Nigeria are still of  some  relevance.   In
     order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  paragraph  276ADE(1)(vi),   the
     Appellant must show that there  are  insurmountable  obstacles  to  his
     reintegration into Nigeria, and the strength or otherwise of  any  ties
     to Nigeria will have a bearing on that.


 10. I find that the Appellant does not have any family members with whom he
     is in contact in Nigeria.  I find that he was abandoned by  his  mother
     and has no contact with her.  I find  that  his  father  suffered  from
     mental health difficulties and the Appellant has never lived with  him,
     nor does he have any contact with him.  I find that the  Appellant  was
     brought up by his aunt.  This is the same aunt who brought him  to  the
     United Kingdom and abandoned him here.  I find that the  Appellant  has
     not had any contact with the aunt who abandoned him.


 11. The Appellant was abandoned together with his brother who has leave  to
     remain in the United Kingdom.  He  has  children  of  his  own  and  is
     employed.  The Appellant was also accompanied by two cousins who remain
     in the United Kingdom.  The Appellant, his  brother  and  cousins  were
     left with a paternal aunt.  I find that she is  living  in  the  United
     Kingdom.


 12. I find that the Appellant does not have any family in Nigeria who would
     be able to provide him with support on return to Nigeria to assist  him
     on his reintegration there.


 13. I find that the Appellant left Nigeria when he was 14 years old.  He is
     now 27 years old.  He has spent thirteen years, almost half  his  life,
     living in the United Kingdom.  He has not been back to Nigeria since he
     left, thirteen years ago.  I find that the time he spent in Nigeria was
     when he was a minor.  He has spent all of his adult  life  as  well  as
     most of his teenage years in the United Kingdom.  I find that  he  does
     not have a network of friends and  contacts  in  Nigeria.   He  has  no
     experience of working in Nigeria.


 14. There is no evidence before me  that  the  Appellant  has  any  medical
     problems.  He is 27 years old.  He has  been  educated  in  the  United
     Kingdom although he has  not  finished  his  degree  due  to  financial
     problems.  He is not working at the moment as he is not entitled to  do
     so.


 15. I find that the Appellant would be returning to Nigeria on his own.   I
     accept that he is in a genuine and  subsisting  relationship  with  his
     wife, and that she is pregnant, but I am  considering  the  Appellant's
     position returning alone.


 16. I have taken into account the Respondent's  Operational  Guidance  Note
     and the evidence of the high unemployment rates  in  Nigeria.   I  find
     that there would be difficulties for the Appellant  reintegrating  into
     Nigeria given his lack of any meaningful support network, and his  lack
     of employment experience in Nigeria.  However  I  find  that  he  is  a
     healthy and educated young man who speaks English.  Whereas I find that
     there would be obstacles for the Appellant, I find that they would  not
     be "very significant".  I find on the balance of probabilities that the
     Appellant has  failed  to  show  that  he  meets  the  requirements  of
     paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).


Article 8 outside the immigration rules


 17. I have considered the Appellant's appeal under Article  8  outside  the
     immigration rules, in particular in relation to his family  life.   The
     finding that he did not meet the requirements of paragraph EX.1 had not
     been cross-appealed and there  was  an  acceptance  that  this  finding
     should stand.  However, at the  date  of  the  hearing  before  me  the
     situation has changed in that the Appellant's wife is pregnant.


 18. I have considered the Appellant's appeal in accordance with the case of
     Razgar [2004] UKHL 27.  I find that the Appellant is in a  genuine  and
     subsisting relationship with his wife.  I find that  he  has  a  family
     with her sufficient to engage the operation of Article 8.  I find  that
     the decision would interfere with that right.


 19. Continuing the steps set out  in  Razgar,  I  find  that  the  proposed
     interference would be in accordance with the law, as  being  a  regular
     immigration decision taken by UKBA in accordance with  the  immigration
     rules.  In terms of proportionality, the Tribunal has to strike a  fair
     balance between the rights of the individual and the interests  of  the
     community.  The public interest in this case  is  the  preservation  of
     orderly and fair immigration control in the interests of all  citizens.
     Maintaining the integrity of the immigration rules is self-evidently  a
     very important public interest.  In practice, this will  usually  trump
     the  qualified  rights  of  the  individual,  unless   the   level   of
     interference is very significant.  I find that in this case, the  level
     of  interference  would  be  significant  and  that  it  would  not  be
     proportionate.


 20. In carrying out the proportionality exercise, I have taken into account
     my findings above in relation  to  the  appeal  under  the  immigration
     rules.


 21. I have also taken into account section 117B of the 2002  Act.   Section
     117B(1) provides that the maintenance of effective immigration controls
     is in the public interest.


 22. The Appellant speaks English (117B(2)).  I find  that  the  Appellant's
     wife is employed full-time as a teacher.  There was evidence before the
     First-tier Tribunal in the form of her letter offering employment.  She
     gave evidence at the hearing that she earned about �29,000  per  annum.
     Payslips are provided in the Appellant's bundle (pages 26  to  28).   I
     find on the balance of probabilities that the Appellant has shown  that
     he would be financially independent (117B(3)).


 23. While sections 117B(4) and (5) do not apply to family life I have taken
     into account that the Appellant's leave to remain was  precarious  when
     he entered into his relationship with his wife.  However, I  find  that
     the Appellant was abandoned here as a minor, and I find that he  cannot
     be blamed  for  the  time  that  he  was  without  status.   Given  the
     circumstances in which he came to be present in the United  Kingdom,  I
     find that although the relationship with his wife began when his status
     was precarious, this does not greatly reduce the weight to be given  to
     his family life.


 24. Section 117B(6) is not relevant as the  Appellant  does  not  have  any
     children.  However, his wife is pregnant  and,  as  she  is  a  British
     citizen, I find that their child will be a British citizen.   It  would
     not be in the interests of that child for his parents to  be  separated
     prior to his birth.


 25. I find that the Appellant's wife has lived in the  United  Kingdom  for
     all of her life.  I find that all of her family are here, her  parents,
     her siblings and her extended family in the form of aunts  and  uncles.
     I find that her friends are here.  I find that she has employment  here
     as a teacher.  I find that  she  is  pregnant.   I  find  that  she  is
     receiving medical care in relation to that pregnancy to  which  she  is
     entitled by virtue of her status as a British citizen.


 26.  I have considered whether it would be proportionate to expect  her  to
     leave the United Kingdom and to go to Nigeria in order to enjoy  family
     life with the Appellant.  In doing so I have considered the  fact  that
     she is pregnant.  I have found above that the Appellant does  not  have
     any family members or friends who could support him on his return,  and
     I find this is even more relevant if he were to be returning  with  his
     wife given that she is pregnant.  The Appellant's wife  stated  in  her
     witness statement that she does not know anyone in Nigeria, and I  find
     that there would be no support for them  either  from  any  friends  or
     family of the Appellant, or from any friends or family of his wife.   I
     have  found  that  the  Appellant  would  find  it  difficult  to  find
     employment without having had experience of life in Nigeria as an adult
     and without having a support network of friends and  family  to  assist
     him.  While I have found that these  difficulties  would  not  be  very
     significant were he to be returning alone, if he were to  be  returning
     with a pregnant wife, these would cause greater problems.


 27. I have taken into account the evidence of the provision of medical care
     in  Nigeria.   I  find  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that   the
     Appellant's wife would not have access to the same  levels  of  medical
     care to which she is entitled in the United Kingdom in relation to  her
     pregnancy, certainly not without paying.  Given  my  finding  that  the
     Appellant may struggle to find employment immediately  on  return,  and
     the fact that they will not have any  other  support,  I  find  on  the
     balance of probabilities that they would not be  able  to  afford  such
     medical treatment.   There  is  therefore  the  possibility  that  such
     medical treatment would be refused.


 28. I further find that the circumstances under which  the  Appellant  left
     Nigeria, and his childhood in Nigeria should be taken into account.  He
     was abandoned by his mother at a very young age.  His father had mental
     health problems.  He does not know where either of them  are.   He  was
     then brought up by an aunt who  abandoned  him  for  the  second  time,
     leaving him in a foreign country as a child.  The only immediate family
     member with whom he is in contact is his brother who is living  in  the
     United Kingdom.  His cousins with whom he came to  the  United  Kingdom
     are also settled here, as is the aunt with whom he was  left.   I  find
     that his closest family members are all in the United Kingdom and it is
     to those he would turn for support on the birth of his child.


 29. I have taken into account the  case  of  Agyarko  [2017]  UKSC  11,  in
     particular paragraph 51.  This states that "if an applicant -  even  if
     residing in the UK unlawfully - was otherwise  certain  to  be  granted
     leave to enter, at least if an application were made from  outside  the
     UK, then there might be no public interest in his or her removal".  The
     Appellant has  no  criminal  convictions.   He  is  in  a  genuine  and
     subsisting relationship with a British citizen.  She earns in excess of
     the amount  required  to  sponsor  a  spouse  application.   He  speaks
     English.  She is pregnant  with  his  child,  who  will  be  a  British
     citizen.  The Appellant has nobody in Nigeria who could support him  if
     he returned to make an entry clearance application.  In  the  meantime,
     he would be leaving his pregnant wife without support, and he would not
     be present for the birth of their child.


 30. I find that the Appellant has established himself in the United Kingdom
     having been abandoned here as a child.  His close family is here.   His
     wife's family are here.  She has always lived here.  I find  that  they
     would struggle in Nigeria given the lack of support.  I find  that  the
     Appellant's wife would struggle to obtain medical  treatment.   In  the
     United Kingdom she is  entitled  to  receive  such  treatment  free  of
     charge, being a British citizen.


 31. I have also taken into  account  the  fact  that,  had  the  Respondent
     properly considered the Appellant's case in 2013 and paid attention  to
     the  previous  findings  of  the  Tribunal  in  2009  relating  to  the
     Appellant's lack of ties to Nigeria, given the immigration rules at the
     time, it is highly  likely  that  the  Respondent  would  have  made  a
     different decision.  I find that this is a  factor  to  be  taken  into
     account although of course I accept that the current immigration  rules
     are different.


 32. I also find that, were I considering paragraph EX.1 as at the  date  of
     this hearing, given the change in  circumstances  in  relation  to  the
     pregnancy, and taking into account the findings of Judge Morgan, it  is
     more  than  possible  that  I  would  have  found   that   there   were
     insurmountable obstacles to  the  Appellant  and  his  wife  continuing
     family life in Nigeria.


 33. I therefore find, taking into account all the evidence before me,  that
     the Appellant has shown  on  the  balance  of  probabilities  that  the
     decision is a breach of his rights and those of his wife  to  a  family
     life under Article 8 ECHR.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award.  I have decided to make no  fee  award
as the circumstances of the Appellant have  changed  since  the  application
was made.
