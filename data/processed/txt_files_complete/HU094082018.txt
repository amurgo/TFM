For the Respondent:    Mr E. Tufan, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer


                          DECISION AND REASONS (V)

This has been a remote hearing which has been consented to  /  not  objected
to by the parties.  The form of remote hearing was  V  (video).  A  face  to
face hearing was not held because it was not  practicable,  and  all  issues
could be determined in a remote hearing.

The documents that I was referred to included the  appellant's  bundle  from
the  original  hearing  before  the   First-tier   Tribunal,   supplementary
appellant's bundles served in April and  September  2020,  the  contents  of
which I have recorded.

The order made is described at the end of these reasons.

The parties said this about the process: they were content that the  hearing
had been conducted fairly in its remote form.

 1. This is an appeal against a decision of the respondent dated  10  April
    2018 to refuse  the  appellant's  human  rights  claim.  The  appellant
    originally  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.  In   a   decision
    promulgated on 16 April 2019,  Tribunal  Judge  ST  Fox  dismissed  the
    appellant's appeal, following a hearing six months earlier. Sitting  at
    the Royal Courts of Justice in Belfast on 13 February 2020, I found the
    decision of Judge Fox to have involved the making of an error  of  law,
    and set it aside in its entirety, with no findings of fact preserved. I
    directed that the matter be reheard in the Upper Tribunal, and  it  was
    in those circumstances that it returned to me  for  the  appeal  to  be
    reheard.  My error of law decision may be found in the  Annex  to  this
    decision.

 2. I informed the parties at the hearing that the appellant's appeal would
    be allowed.  I now give my reasons for allowing the appeal.

Factual background

 3. The appellant is Alexandra Campeau, a Canadian citizen  born  in  1985.
    She arrived in this the United Kingdom on a Tier 5 Youth Mobility  visa
    in February 2013, valid until 7 January 2015.  She  was  later  granted
    leave as the partner of a settled person, valid  until  15  July  2017.
    That relationship has since come to an end, and the  appellant  is  not
    currently in a relationship.  She applied for further leave  to  remain
    on 11 July 2017, based  on  her  private  life.   The  application  was
    refused on the basis that the appellant  could  not  meet  any  of  the
    private  life  provisions  contained  in  paragraph   276ADE   of   the
    Immigration Rules, and there were no exceptional circumstances  outside
    the rules such that it would  be  unjustifiably  harsh  to  expect  the
    applicant to return to Canada.

The appellant's case

 4.  The  appellant  works  in  the  film  industry  in  Northern  Ireland,
    specifically for a company which provides extras for filming.  The role
    she performs features on  the  "shortage  occupation  list"  under  the
    category "3416 -  arts  officers,  producers  and  directors",  and  is
    therefore exempt from the  resident  labour  market  test  set  out  in
    paragraph 78A(a) of Appendix A of  the  Immigration  Rules.  She  earns
    �30,000 per annum, and the company for which  she  works  has  recently
    secured Tier 2 sponsor status and has provided her with  a  certificate
    of  sponsorship.  She  speaks  English  and   meets   the   maintenance
    requirements.  The case she now advances to  resist  removal  on  human
    rights grounds is that her current employment  satisfies  the  criteria
    for leave to remain under Tier  2.  It  would  not  be  in  the  public
    interest to remove her from the United Kingdom, given the inevitability
    of her making a successful application for entry clearance.  Allied  to
    that  submission,  she  relies  on  the  likelihood   of   encountering
    significant difficulties upon attempting to make  such  an  application
    from overseas at the present time, in light of the travel  restrictions
    which are, or could imminently  be,  imposed  on  international  travel
    between the United Kingdom and  Canada  in  response  to  the  Covid-19
    Pandemic. Given she meets the substantive requirements of the rules for
    leave  to  remain  on  a  Tier  2   basis,   her   removal   would   be
    disproportionate under Article 8 of the European  Convention  on  Human
    Rights, she submits.

 5. In support of the case she now advances, in  her  supplementary  bundle
    served in April 2020 following the directions I gave in my error of law
    decision,  the  appellant  provided  six  months'  of  payslips,   bank
    statements, a copy of her certificate of sponsorship, and other details
    relating  to  her  employer.  She  also  provided  an  updated  witness
    statement.  At  the  hearing  before  me,  she  adopted   her   updated
    statements, and confirmed that  she  continues  to  work  in  the  same
    capacity and to receive a salary of �30,000.

 6. For the Secretary of State, Mr Tufan declined to engage with  the  case
    the appellant now advances. He had no  cross-examination  and  did  not
    seek to challenge the evidence that she relies upon to demonstrate  her
    salary and employment details.

 7. Mr Tufan's primary submission was that the Secretary of State  has  not
    had the opportunity to consider whether the applicant does indeed  meet
    the criteria for a Tier 2 grant of leave  to  remain,  and  it  is  the
    Secretary of State, as primary decision maker,  who  should  take  that
    decision in the first instance. It is open to the appellant to make the
    appropriate application to the Secretary of State, he  contends.  While
    acknowledging that the Presidential Panel in Birch (Precariousness  and
    mistake; new matters) [2020]  UKUT  00086  (IAC)  held  that  the  "new
    matter" regime applies only to the First-tier  Tribunal,  and  not  the
    Upper Tribunal, he contended, without providing any  reasons  or  legal
    submissions, that that decision was wrong.

Legal framework

 8. This appeal is brought under Article 8 of the  European  Convention  on
    Human Rights.  The essential issue for my consideration is  whether  it
    would  be  proportionate  under  the  terms  of  Article  8(2)  of  the
    Convention for the appellant to be removed, in the light of the private
    life she claims  to  have  established  here.   This  issue  is  to  be
    addressed primarily through the lens of  the  respondent's  Immigration
    Rules and by reference to the requirements of Article 8 directly.

 9. The  relevant  Immigration  Rules  may  be  found  in  paragraph  245HD
    (substantive requirements for Tier  2  (General)  Migrants),  paragraph
    78A(a) of Appendix  A  (attributes  for  Tier  2  (General)  Migrants),
    paragraph 78A (Resident Labour Market Test  exemption),  and  Annex  K,
    Table 1 (United Kingdom Shortage Occupation List).

Discussion

10. As this is an appeal brought on human rights grounds, the focus  of  my
    analysis must be whether it would be  disproportionate  to  remove  the
    appellant, in light of the requirements of Article 8 of the convention.
     It is for the appellant to establish  her  case,  to  the  balance  of
    probabilities standard.

11. I have no hesitation in finding that Article 8 would be engaged by  the
    removal of the appellant. She has resided here since February 2013  and
    has during that time been in at least two relationships.  She has  been
    employed in the film industry for some time.  She has  put  down  roots
    here. Mr Tufan accepted that Article  8(1)  would  be  engaged  by  her
    removal. I accept that her removal would be in accordance with the law,
    in the sense that it is governed by  an  established  legal  framework,
    coupled with  a  right  of  appeal  to  this  tribunal.  It  would,  in
    principle, be capable of being regarded as necessary  in  a  democratic
    society for the  purposes  of  Article  8(2)  of  the  Convention.  The
    remaining  question  is  whether  the  appellant's  removal  would   be
    proportionate.

12. To assess  the  proportionality  of  the  appellant's  removal,  it  is
    necessary to address the issue primarily through the Immigration Rules,
    and then outside the rules if necessary.

13. The appellant does not contend that she  would  face  very  significant
    obstacles upon her return to Canada.  She does not attempt to  rely  on
    the private life provisions of the rules.

14. Were this a hearing in the First-tier Tribunal, Mr Hollywood's reliance
    on Tier 2 of the Immigration Rules would be a "new  matter",  requiring
    the consent of the Secretary  of  State  under  section  85(5)  of  the
    Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act")  .    The
    appellant's employment itself is not a new matter; it  was  before  the
    Secretary of State, and was the subject of discussion,  albeit  flawed,
    by the First-tier Tribunal.  It is the appellant's reliance on  Tier  2
    of the rules which would be a "new matter" were this  case  before  the
    FTT.  However, in light of Birch, it is now clear that the "new matter"
    regime does not apply to the Upper Tribunal, as  a  superior  court  of
    record.  Paragraph 2 of the Headnote reads as follows:

         "The prohibition on considering new matters in s 85 of the 2002 Act
         does not apply to proceedings in the Upper Tribunal."

    See [22] and [23] of Birch for the Vice President's reasoning, which  I
    adopt and incorporate.

15. While Mr Tufan clearly disagrees with  the  conclusions  of  the  Upper
    Tribunal in Birch for policy reasons, he did not make  any  submissions
    contending that it was wrong in law. Such concerns cannot  be  a  basis
    for me to depart from a decision of the President and Vice President of
    this tribunal.

16. There is a further reason why it would not  be  right  to  depart  from
    Birch.  As an appellate tribunal, it is necessary for me to ensure that
    my  decision  remaking  the  appeal  is  itself  compatible  with   the
    requirements of the ECHR.  So much is clear from the  judgment  of  the
    Court of Appeal in GM (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of  State  for  the  Home
    Department [2019] EWCA Civ 1630 which held that an appellate  court  or
    tribunal seized of an issue must take into account the most up to  date
    position, to ensure that it acts compatibly with the Convention.  Green
    LJ addressed the necessity of taking a decision  by  reference  to  the
    contemporary position in these terms, at [7]:

         "This raises a point of principle. When  a  Court  is  required  to
         address an issue relating to fundamental norms or human rights that
         Court must ensure that any order that it makes is also  compliant
         with such rights. Under section 6 Human Rights Act 1998 all  public
         bodies, including courts, must apply the Act and thereby the ECHR.
         It follows that if an appellate court finds that a lower  court  or
         tribunal acted lawfully by reference to the evidence before it  but
         that based upon the facts now known to the appeal court  to  uphold
         the decision would violate fundamental norms,  then  the  appellate
         court must ensure that the decision it takes is compliant with the
         law." (Emphasis original)

17. That leads to the Tier 2-based submissions made  by  Mr  Hollywood,  in
    which the appellant relies on the following extract of the judgement of
    the then Senior President of Tribunals in TZ (Pakistan) v Secretary  of
    State for the Home Department [2018] EWCA Civ 1109, at [34]:

         "...where a person satisfies the [Immigration]  Rules,  whether  or
         not by reference to an article 8 informed  requirement,  then  this
         will be positively determinative of that person's article 8 appeal,
         provided their case engages article 8(1), for the very reason  that
         it would then be disproportionate for that person to be removed..."
         (emphasis added)

18. In Mr Hollywood's submission, if the appellant meets  the  requirements
    for leave to remain on a Tier 2 basis, it matters not that the  Tier  2
    regime is not an "article 8 informed  requirement",  in  light  of  the
    approach of the Senior President in TZ.

19. Mr Tufan resists that reading of TZ.  He submits that, read as a whole,
    the focus of TZ was the Article 8 informed requirements of the  private
    and family life provisions of the rules, and that  the  emphasis  above
    should be read in that context.

20. I accept Mr Hollywood's submissions concerning the import of TZ and the
    relevance of the non-Article 8 provisions of the Immigration Rules. The
    Senior President was addressing precisely this sort of situation by his
    use of the term, "whether or not by reference to an article 8  informed
    requirement". It happened that  the  focus  of  the  remainder  of  the
    discussion in TZ related to the private and family life  provisions  of
    the rules, but that was because the facts of the case so demanded  such
    an approach. By contrast, in the present matter, there has been no real
    challenge to the Secretary of State's decision on the  basis  that  the
    appellant would face no "very significant obstacles" to her integration
    in Canada. The present focus of the appellant's case is that she  meets
    the  requirements  of  the  rules,  and   it   would,   therefore,   be
    disproportionate for her to be removed.

21. I find that the appellant  meets  the  following  requirements  of  the
    rules.

22. The appellant requires 70 points  in  total  under  paragraph  245HD(f)
    (requirements for leave to remain: Tier 2 (General)):

      a. She has a Certificate of Sponsorship in a field where the  Resident
         Labour Market Test Exemption applies.  This attracts 30 points.

      b. Her  salary  of  �30,000  per  annum,  amply  demonstrated  by  the
         unchallenged documentary evidence (bank  statements  and  payslips)
         provided, attracts 20 points.  Her unchallenged oral  evidence  was
         that she has continued to work  in  the  same  role,  earning  this
         figure, throughout the pandemic.

      c. As a citizen of a majority English speaking country (see  Table  2,
         Appendix B) she is awarded 10 points.

      d. She meets the maintenance requirements set out at paragraphs 4  and
         5 of Appendix C of the rules.  The unchallenged  financial  picture
         presented by the bank statements  demonstrates  a  regular  balance
         significantly in excess of �945.

    The appellant enjoys a total of 70 points.

23. The appellant does not, however,  meet  the  requirement  at  paragraph
    245HD(b) to have, or have last been granted, entry clearance  or  leave
    to enter or leave to remain in one of the listed capacities.  Her  last
    grant of leave was on the basis of  being  the  partner  of  a  settled
    person.  Her leave continues under section 3C of  the  Immigration  Act
    1971, but that does not cure this defect.

24. Under the Points Based System, there is no "near miss" doctrine.   That
    is not necessarily fatal to this human rights appeal, however,  as  the
    question for my consideration is whether the appellant's removal  would
    be proportionate.  Relevant to that  issue  is  whether  the  appellant
    would be successful in an application for entry clearance, were she  to
    leave the country and apply from overseas.

25. There was some discussion at the hearing of the  respondent's  Covid-19
    guidance, which  suggests  that,  in  some  circumstances,  it  is  not
    necessary to leave the country to make a visa  application  that  would
    ordinarily fall to be  made  from  outside  the  country.   I  was  not
    provided with the current guidance by either party and so do not factor
    the guidance into my decision, although, of course, the impact  of  the
    pandemic on the necessity and utility of making an overseas application
    is a relevant consideration.

26. In order to address proportionality overall, I will conduct  a  balance
    sheet analysis, by reference to the remaining  submissions  which  were
    advanced at the hearing.

27. Factors mitigating against the appellant's removal include:

      a. An application for entry clearance is very likely to be successful.
          The applicant has a Certificate of Sponsorship from  her  employer
         in  a  shortage  occupation  field.   She  meets  the   substantive
         requirements of the rules.   She can boast 70 points.  There was no
         suggestion from the presenting officer that she did  not  meet  the
         substantive requirements of the  rules,  nor  did  he  provide  any
         reasons as to why such an application would not be successful.

      b. The appellant is economically  self-sufficient  with  a  relatively
         high salary.  She speaks English.

      c. The appellant is of impeccable character and currently holds  leave
         to remain under section 3C of the Immigration  Act  971.   She  has
         never been an overstayer.

      d. Requiring the appellant to return to Canada  at  the  present  time
         could expose her to the real possibility  of  travel  restrictions,
         visa delays, and significantly interrupted residence here.  On  the
         date of the hearing, the Westminster government announced that  the
         incidence  of  the   virus   was   increasing,   imposing   further
         restrictions, with the warning of more to come.  Were the appellant
         to leave the country, aside from any risk arising from  the  travel
         itself, there is no certainty that she could re-enter, or that  her
         visa application would be processed in a timely manner.

28. Factors militating in favour of the appellant's removal include:

      a. The public interest in the  maintenance  of  effective  immigration
         controls, under section 117B(1) of the 2002 Act.

      b. There  may  be  some  public  interest  benefit  to  requiring  the
         appellant to leave to make such an application.   It  could  enable
         the Secretary of State to assume the role of primary decision maker
         in the application (in light of Mr Tufan's refusal to  engage  with
         the issue before me) and scrutinise the appellant's application  in
         light  of  the  Secretary  of  State's  constitutional   role   and
         specialist expertise in the field of immigration.

      c. Aside from the Tier 2-based submissions,  the  appellant  does  not
         meet any other provisions of the immigration rules,  in  particular
         she does not meet the private life provisions, which have been made
         by the Secretary of State to cater for this sort of situation.

      d. The appellant's  immigration  status  is  precarious  and  attracts
         little weight accordingly.

      e. There is no near-miss doctrine under the Points Based System.

29. Weighing the factors in favour of the appellant's removal against those
    mitigating against it, I conclude that it would be disproportionate for
    her to be removed.  She  meets  the  substantive  requirements  of  the
    Immigration Rules, save for being present in the  wrong  capacity,  and
    would be highly likely, if not virtually  certain,  to  succeed  in  an
    application for entry clearance. However, expecting her  to  leave  the
    country at the present time would expose her to a  considerable  amount
    of uncertainty, with the potential for significant restrictions on  her
    ability to return, and the potential  for  significantly  delayed  visa
    processing. While there is, in general  terms,  a  public  interest  in
    expecting applicants to leave the country to make  an  application  for
    entry clearance, in some cases it will be an empty formality,  bringing
    with it the potential for significant interruptions to the  appellant's
    private life, with no  apparent  justification.   As  the  Presidential
    panel in Younas (section 117B(6)(b); Chikwamba; Zambrano)  [2020]  UKUT
    129 (IAC) put it at [96]:

         "In some cases, the fact that a person will be able to re-enter the
         UK means that there will be no public interest at all in his or her
         removal."

    This is one such case.

30. The appellant's shortage occupation role in Belfast is  one  which  has
    been identified by the Secretary of State  as  being  exempt  from  the
    resident Labour market test, reflecting the public interest in  filling
    roles of this nature. The appellant herself as a  woman  of  impeccable
    character, who has never been an overstayer, still less have there been
    any other suitability concerns raised in relation to her.  Although her
    immigration status is precarious, in the sense that she is not settled,
    she has lived here with leave since 2013,  and  currently  still  holds
    leave to  remain.   There  are  degrees  of  precariousness:  see,  for
    example, CL v Secretary of State for the Home  Department  [2019]  EWCA
    Civ 1925 at [57].  She has lived her for seven and  a  half  years  and
    will have put down roots in that  time.    Eligibility  for  indefinite
    leave to remain on the basis of ten years' continuous lawful  residence
    is within sight.  While her leave is precarious, it is  at  the  lesser
    end of the scale of precariousness.  While the  appellant's  linguistic
    skills and  economic  independence  are  neutral  factors,  my  overall
    proportionality assessment is  that,  under  these  circumstances,  her
    removal would be disproportionate.

31. This appeal is allowed.

Notice of Decision

The appeal is allowed on human rights grounds.

TO THE RESPONDENT
FEE AWARD

As I have allowed the appeal and because a fee has been paid or is  payable,
I have considered making a fee award and have decided to make no  fee  award
for the following reason.  The appellant's appeal has succeeded on a  wholly
different basis to that originally considered  by  the  Secretary  of  State
rendering a fee award inappropriate.

                            ERROR OF LAW DECISION


 1. The appellant, Alexandria Campeau, is a citizen of Canada, born  on  30
    December 1985.  She appeals against a decision of  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge ST Fox  promulgated  on  16  April  2019  dismissing  her  appeal
    Secretary of State's refusal of her human rights claim, dated 10  April
    2018.



Factual background

 2. The appellant arrived in this country on a Tier 5 Youth  Mobility  visa
    in February 2013, valid until 7 January 2015.  She  was  later  granted
    leave as the partner of a settled person, valid  until  15  July  2017.
    She applied for further leave to remain on 11 July 2017, on  the  basis
    of her private life.  Her relationship with her former partner  had  by
    then ended.  The application was  refused,  and  it  was  that  refusal
    decision that was considered by Judge Fox.  By the time Judge Fox heard
    the appeal in October 2018, the appellant had begun a new  relationship
    with a different partner.   Judge Fox ascribed minimal significance  to
    that relationship, as it was in its "infancy" [21].

 3. The judge addressed the private life the appellant had claimed to  have
    developed while in this country. Much of the judge's  analysis  rotated
    around the appellant's role working in the  TV  and  film  industry  in
    Northern Ireland, in relation to which she claimed to have  secured  an
    important role that was contributing to the regional economy. The judge
    considered that those skills would be useful in Canada where there  was
    an "burgeoning" TV and film industry, writing that it was:

         "particularly centred in and  around  Ontario  (where  the  popular
         series Suits is filmed) and Vancouver (in conjunction with Seattle)
         were [sic] quite a number of successful movies have  been  located,
         filmed and produced from."

    The judge rejected the appellant's evidence that she was, to adopt  his
    paraphrase, "an integral and important member of this industry Northern
    Ireland [sic]". She had been "lucky" to secure employment in that field
    in this country but was "pretty much on the lower rungs of the ladder".
    She was not "irreplaceable".

 4. The judge did not consider that it was necessary to consider Article  8
    of the ECHR outside the Immigration Rules. At [11], he said:

         "I am satisfied on the evidence before me today that there  is  not
         an arguable case for considering the Article 8 claim outside of the
         rules. The appellant does not meet the Immigration Rules."

 5. Permission to appeal was granted by Upper Tribunal Judge Grubb  on  the
    basis that the six month delay between the hearing and promulgation  of
    the decision may have resulted  in  the  appellant's  new  relationship
    acquiring a new significance.  Judge Grubb  also  considered  that  the
    judge had arguably erred in relation to the structure of his Article  8
    analysis, by purporting not to have to consider Article 8  outside  the
    rules.

 6. Mr Hollywood informed me that the relationship the appellant was in  at
    the  time  her  appeal  was  heard  before  Judge  Fox,  and  when  the
    application for permission to appeal was made, had  unfortunately  come
    to an end. There was, therefore, no  "family  life"  dimension  to  the
    appeal, and one of  the  bases  upon  which  Judge  Grubb  had  granted
    permission to appeal had accordingly fallen away.

Discussion

 7. It was common ground at the hearing that the judge had erred  with  his
    approach to Article 8 by stating at [11] that  there  was  no  arguable
    case that Article 8 should be considered outside the Immigration Rules.
     It is now well established in this jurisdiction that, when  addressing
    the proportionality of a person's prospective removal for the  purposes
    of Article 8(2)  of  the  European  Convention  on  Human  Rights,  the
    assessment should be conducted, first, by reference to the  Immigration
    Rules, and secondly, outside the rules, to ascertain whether there  are
    exceptional circumstances  or  other  compelling  reasons  which  would
    render the individual's removal  unjustifiably  harsh  and,  therefore,
    disproportionate.

 8. Should any authority be necessary to establish this, I can do no better
    than rely on the position as summarised  by  the  Senior  President  of
    Tribunals in TZ (Pakistan) v Secretary of State for the Home Department
    [2018] EWCA Civ  1109  at,  for  example,  [34],  when  addressing  the
    "insurmountable obstacles" in the Immigration  Rules  which  was  under
    consideration in that matter:

         "Accordingly, the tribunal should undertake an  evaluation  of  the
         insurmountable obstacles test within the Rules in order  to  inform
         an  evaluation  outside  the  Rules  because  that  formulates  the
         strength of the public policy in immigration control 'in  the  case
         before it', which is what the Supreme Court in Hesham Ali (at [50])
         held was to be taken into account. That has the benefit that  where
         a person satisfies the Rules, whether or not  by  reference  to  an
         article 8  informed  requirement,  then  this  will  be  positively
         determinative of that person's article  8  appeal,  provided  their
         case engages article 8(1), for the very reason that it  would  then
         be disproportionate for that person to be removed."

 9. It was, therefore, an error for the judge to conclude at [11]  that  it
    was not necessary for Article 8 outside the rules to be considered.

10. Mr Govan submitted that the error was immaterial.  The judge's analysis
    of Article  8  was  flawed,  but  it  was  difficult  to  see  how  the
    appellant's appeal could succeed in any event, he submitted. There  was
    no challenge to the matters set out in [29], he observed, in which  the
    judge considered the appellant's private life in  the  United  Kingdom,
    concluding that the appellant would be able to  maintain  relationships
    through modern means of communication, and the  friends  that  she  has
    made while living in Northern Ireland would be able  to  visit  her  in
    Canada.

11. While there is force in that submission, the  difficulty  is  that  the
    judge based his findings concerning the  appellant's  private  life  on
    irrelevant considerations that had not been  part  of  the  appellant's
    evidence in the case. His discussion at [23] of the  "burgeoning  movie
    and TV industry in Canada" was entirely of his own motion and was based
    on evidence or  materials  other  than  those  which  were  before  the
    tribunal.  The judge took into account immaterial factors.

12. The judge's findings at [24] concerning the nature of  the  appellant's
    current role were reached against the background  of  his  findings  at
    [23] which were based on immaterial  matters.   He  dismissed  evidence
    from the appellant's  current  employer  as  self-serving:  [26].   The
    absence of supporting witnesses with nothing to gain from the appellant
    remaining in the United Kingdom was "notable".

13. In R (on the application of SS) v  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department ("self-serving" statements) [2017] UKUT  00164  (IAC)  Upper
    Tribunal Judge Peter Lane, as he then was, held the following at [1] of
    the headnote:

"The expression self-serving is, to a large extent, a protean one.  The
expression itself tells us little or nothing.  What is needed is a reason,
however brief, for that designation.  For example, a letter written by a
third party to an applicant for international protection may be 'self-
serving' because it bears the hallmarks of being written to order, in
circumstances where the applicant's case is that the letter was a
spontaneous warning."

14. Taken to  its  logical  conclusion,  the  judge's  description  of  the
    appellant's supporting evidence as  "self-serving"  would  prevent  any
    appellant from ever being able to adduce evidence supporting their case
    for leave to remain in the United Kingdom, unless  they  were  able  to
    obtain evidence from a person with no connection in the case. The judge
    did not engage in any analysis of the reasons  why  he  considered  the
    evidence of the appellant's employer, and others who  had  worked  with
    her, to be self-serving.  The use of the  term  "self-serving"  by  the
    judge appears to be a technique he deployed the discount the weight  to
    be ascribed to the evidence, without engaging in any detailed  analysis
    of the evidence, or the reasons why it attracts less weight.

15. I am, therefore, unable to  accept  Mr  Govan's  submissions  that  the
    judge's error was immaterial. The appellant's appeal was decided on the
    basis of a flawed  credibility  assessment,  which  took  into  account
    irrelevant factual matters that were not capable of  being  established
    by the evidence in the case, assessed through the lens of  a  defective
    Article 8 analysis.  Some sixteen months have elapsed since the  matter
    was considered by the First-tier Tribunal.  A  contemporary  assessment
    is required.  Indeed, Mr Hollywood submitted that the appellant's  role
    could be capable of meeting the requirements of the Immigration  Rules,
    quite apart from her own private life (see the direction below).

Conclusion

16. I set aside the decision of Judge Fox with no findings preserved.   The
    matter is to be reheard in the Upper Tribunal at  the  first  available
    date.



Notice of Decision

The decision of Judge Fox involved the making of an error of law and is  set
aside with no findings preserved. I direct that the  matter  be  reheard  in
the Upper Tribunal.

I give the following direction:

    Within 28 days of being sent this decision, the  appellant  must  serve
    (i) any updated evidence upon which she seeks to rely at  the  remaking
    hearing; and (ii) written submissions setting out the basis upon  which
    she contends  the  appeal  should  be  allowed,  by  reference  to  the
    Immigration Rules, and Article 8 outside the rules.

No anonymity direction is made.
