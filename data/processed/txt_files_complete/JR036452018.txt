                    ON AN APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW

                                   JUDGMENT
                          - - - - - - - - - - - - -

    JUDGE KING: Challenge is made to the decision of the  respondent  dated
    11th January 2018 refusing  to  grant  indefinite  leave  to  the  main
    applicant.  His wife is a dependant to that  claim.  For  the  sake  of
    clarity the reference in this Judgment to the applicant refers  to  the
    First applicant.   Challenge is also made to the  decision  by  way  of
    administrative review of 22nd February 2018.  Permission was granted to
    challenge the decisions.  Accordingly, this is a substantive hearing to
    determine the issues and resolve the challenge.


1.   Throughout the relevant period the applicant was the sole  director  of
    MAA Consultancy Services Ltd and as such he earned a  salary  from  the
    business, together with dividends.


2.   In an application  to  the  respondent  made  on  15th  July  2010  the
    applicant declared income from dividends to be  �15,000.00  as  between
    the tax years 2009/10 and 2010/11.


3.   It was noted that for those two tax years the  applicant  had  declared
    to HMRC a dividend of �9,666.00,  an  under-declaration  of  �5,334.00.
    That under-declaration was subsequently amended on 26th October 2017.


4.   On a subsequent application made on 18th  October  2017  the  applicant
    declared to the respondent dividends in the sum of �14,500.00  for  the
    tax years 2011/12 and 2012/13.  A similar declaration to HMRC for  that
    period revealed a disclosure  of  �3,888.00,  an  under-declaration  of
    �10,612.00.


5.   There was a subsequent amendment of the tax return of 12th  April  2016
    declaring �3,880.00 for 2011/12 and an amendment on 29th May  2017  for
    the tax year 2012/13 declaring �17,220.00.


6.   Following the application for indefinite leave to remain  made  on  3rd
    February 2016, there was a request  made  by  the  respondent  on  20th
    February 2017 for documents in support of the application and documents
    were supplied.  The documents from HMRC  were  part  of  the  documents
    supplied by and on behalf of the applicant.


7.   A further request by the respondent for documents of 15th May 2017  was
    complied with  and  under  cover  of  a  letter  of  9th  June  2017  a
    questionnaire was duly completed.


8.   In summary, the respondent in the original  decision  of  11th  January
    2018, considered that the explanations offered by  the  applicant  were
    not such as to properly explain the discrepancies in  the  declarations
    that had been made.  Thus came the conclusion:-


     "We are satisfied that, based on your actions  in  declaring  different
         amounts of income to HMRC and UKVI, you have either  misrepresented
         your earnings to HMRC in order to produce  your  tax  liability  or
         provided false information about your earnings to UKVI in order  to
         obtain leave to remain or both".


     It was considered that, by reason of the character and conduct  of  the
    applicant, it would be undesirable to allow him to remain in the United
    Kingdom  under  paragraph  322(5)  of  the   Immigration   Rules.   His
    application was refused on that basis.


9.   Further it was refused pursuant to paragraph 245CD of  the  Immigration
    Rules and paragraphs 19(i) and 19(j) of Appendix A of  the  Immigration
    Rules on the basis that no reliance could be placed  upon  the  claimed
    earnings submitted in the application for indefinite leave  to  remain,
    namely the �40,159.54 salary and dividends for the period 1st  February
    2015 to 31st January 2016.


10.  The decision by way of administrative review upheld the decision.


11.  Miss  Idelbi,  in  her  submissions,  contends  that  there  was  ample
    material before the Secretary of State at the time of the decisions  to
    justify the  conclusion  as  to  the  unsatisfactory  explanations  put
    forward by the applicant, and indeed  she  submits  that  the  evidence
    submitted  subsequently  to  the  decisions  has   not   improved   the
    applicant's case.


12.  In a letter of 9th June 2017, the solicitors acting on  behalf  of  the
    applicant set out his earnings, gross  profit,  net  profit,  expenses,
    salary and dividends from the period 1st December 2009 through to  31st
    May 2016.  The solicitors perhaps unhelpfully added  the  comment  that
    there was no specific requirement for a director to register for  self-
    assessment if there was no further tax liability for the year.  That is
    not the explanation put forward by the  applicant  at  that  time,  and
    indeed it is clear that he did  submit  a  self-assessment  as  to  his
    earnings and did declare some dividends to HMRC for each tax period.


13.  In the questionnaire at question 14 the applicant was asked whether  he
    had ever needed to correct or resubmit his tax returns, and if so  why,
    what the cause of the error, when was the  error  discovered  and  what
    action was taken concerning it?


14.  The explanation which was offered by the applicant  was  there  was  an
    oversight because of an over-estimation of expenses.   As  soon  as  he
    realised the error he called his accountant and had the  tax  documents
    amended.  He spoke of the cause of the errors being miscalculation  and
    took immediate action when discovering to amend  so  indicated  "Please
    refer to my representative's covering letter".


15.  It was these explanations that  formed  the  subject  of  the  original
    decision.


16.  An application for administrative review was submitted on 29th  January
    2018, the grounds of challenge set out at  page  40  of  the  composite
    bundle.   Various  explanations  are  set  out  including  the  claimed
    understanding by the applicant that dividends were  not  disclosed  for
    tax purposes.


17.  Miss Idelbi submits that such further explanations  were  not  entirely
    consistent with what had gone before.  Finally, the main applicant made
    a detailed witness statement on 19th November 2008 which postdates  the
    decision.   She  submits  that  the  explanations  there  are  somewhat
    different from the explanations previously offered.


18.  Finally there was an accountant's letter  at  page  38  of  the  bundle
    dated 19th November 2018, giving some explanation for the tax  dividend
    and tax credit amendment  2012/13  and  seeking  to  relate  it  to  an
    estimation of business expenses.  It is not  entirely  clear  how  that
    ties in with the dividends.


19.  Mr Gajjar submits, as  one  of  his  grounds  of  complaint,  that  the
    process by which information was  gleaned  was  not  a  fair  one.   He
    submits that following the submission of the questionnaire there should
    have been an interview with the applicant, or at least  an  opportunity
    to deal with the concerns that  were  in  the  mind  of  the  potential
    decision maker.


20.  That having been said, however, it is apparent from  the  questionnaire
    that the applicant was aware of the under-declarations to HMRC as  they
    appeared  in  his  own  documentation   together   with   the   amended
    declarations.  It was therefore open  to  him,  having  received  legal
    advice, to have set out  the  explanation  in  as  much  detail  as  he
    helpfully could.  He did not do so.  The questionnaire alerted  him  to
    the various matters that fell to be considered.  I find little merit in
    that aspect of the matter.


21.  In terms of process and the inferences which  the  Secretary  of  State
    would be entitled to draw, such has been set out in some detail in  the
    decision of Khan (Dishonesty, tax return, paragraph 322(5)) [2018] UKUT
    00384 (IAC).   The  judgment  sets  out  guidance  in  approach  as  at
    paragraph 37(i) to (viii).


22.  Indication is given as follows:-


         "(ii)    However, where an Applicant has presented evidence to show
                  that, despite the prima facie inference,  he  was  not  in
                  fact dishonest but only careless, then  the  Secretary  of
                  State is presented with  a  fact-finding  task:  she  must
                  decide whether the explanation and evidence is sufficient,
                  in her view, to displace  the  prima  facie  inference  of
                  deceit/dishonesty.


         (iii)    In approaching that fact-finding task,  the  Secretary  of
                  State should remind herself that, although the standard of
                  proof is the 'balance of probability', a  finding  that  a
                  person has been deceitful and dishonest in relation to his
                  tax  affairs  with  the  consequence  that  he  is  denied
                  settlement in this country is a very serious finding  with
                  serious consequences."


23.  The documentation which had been  presented  before  the  Secretary  of
    State under cover of the letter of 22nd September 2017, includes  forms
    SA02 which deal with the tax  declarations  and  calculations  for  the
    respective periods of concern.


24.  In terms of context, the tax calculation  for  the  year  ending  April
    2011 shows income received of �22,477.00 plus the declared dividend  of
    �9,666.00.


25.  It was apparent that tax at 10%  has  already  been  charged  upon  the
    dividend from the company,  such  that  although  it  features  in  the
    calculations, it deducted from the tax  so  far  as  the  applicant  is
    concerned.  It is clear, from the  assessment  form  itself,  that  the
    amount of the dividend as  declared  has  had  no  influence  upon  the
    overall tax figure deducted in the self-assessment.   The  revised  tax
    calculation showing the �15,000.00 of dividends is  also  enclosed  and
    that shows the same, that there is  no  additional  tax  due  from  the
    applicant in respect of those dividends, the tax  having  been  charged
    and paid by the company.


26.  In terms of the tax return that was amended in April 2012 it was  noted
    that there was extra tax due in the sum of �50.00, but it was not taken
    because it was a small amount.  The assessment for the tax year  ending
    2012 showed income from employment of �21,213.00 and a year dividend of
    �3,888.00, the later sum having no influence upon tax affairs so far as
    the personal tax calculation was involved. Similarly when dividends  of
    �17,222.00 were applied that too resulted in no additional  tax  to  be
    paid.  It should have been apparent to the respondent, at the  time  of
    the first decision, that the non-disclosure of the dividend would  have
    no influence upon the personal taxation of the applicant.


27.  Thus turning to  the  decision  under  challenge  and  to  the  comment
    finding that the action in declaring different  amounts  of  income  to
    HMRC and UKVI:-


         "you have either misrepresented earnings to HMRC in order to reduce
         your  tax  liability  or  provided  false  information  about  your
         earnings to UKVI in order to obtain leave to remain or both".


    The point that is made is although the dividend payment is  income,  it
    is not income that is subject to personal tax liability. That  in  turn
    calls into question the assumption that is made that there was an under-
    declaration of dividend in order to reduce tax which, in fact,  is  not
    the case so far as the personal tax calculations were made.


28.  Mr Gajjar submits that the decision was made therefore on an  important
    misunderstanding as to the nature of dividends and of  the  benefit  or
    not that would be received so far as the applicant was  concerned.   It
    seems to me that is a significant matter in the  overall  circumstances
    of this particular case.   If there was no financial advantage  to  the
    applicant in the under-declaration,  such  calls  into  question  as  a
    matter of common sense what could be the motivation. It may be that the
    applicant thought that he was saving tax but he was not  questioned  as
    to that.


29.  In terms of the overall consideration of dishonesty and  in  particular
    the dealings which the main applicant had with the Home Office,  it  is
    clearly relevant for there to be some consideration as to  the  context
    of the applicant's overall dealings.  It is in that connection that the
    letter from the solicitors of 9th June 2017, setting  out  the  income,
    gross profit,  net  profit,  expenses,  salary  and  dividends  of  the
    applicant may be relevant, as there has been no suggestion  articulated
    that there has been any misdeclaration as to the salary and  income  of
    the applicant. There has been no reasoned suggestion that for  the  tax
    years 13/14, 14/15, 15/16, 16/17  there  has  been  any  misinformation
    presented as to the financial position of the main applicant.   If  the
    applicant gained no financial advantage  for  himself,  it  raises  the
    question as to what motive he would have otherwise to use deception  or
    deceit.


30.  As has been set out again in Khan at (v), where an issue arises  as  to
    whether an error in relation to a tax return  is  dishonest  or  merely
    careless, the Secretary of State is obliged to  consider  the  evidence
    pointing in each direction and, in her decision, justify her conclusion
    by a reference to that evidence.


31.  It was noted in the decision that the main applicant claimed  that  the
    inaccurate tax returns were due to a "miscalculation".  The  Respondent
    considered that it was the main applicant's  responsibility  to  ensure
    the correct declaration of earnings.


32.  The nature and scope of  Rule  322(5)  was  considered  by  Mr  Justice
    Collins in a decision of Samant (JR/6546/2016) reported on  26th  April
    2017.  It was held, particularly at paragraph 10 of that decision, that
    the test to be applied in establishing dishonesty was on the balance of
    probabilities.  It has  often  been  said  that  the  more  serious  an
    allegation the  greater  the  level  of  probability  that  has  to  be
    established.  In order to establish dishonesty the higher the level  of
    the balance has to be applied,  albeit  it  is  still  the  balance  of
    probability.  When one looks at the terms of 322(5) conduct must be  at
    a high level in order to justify a finding that it is non-conducive  to
    an individual to remain.  In respect  of  a  false  tax  return  it  is
    necessary to establish that it was done deliberately and not  simply  a
    mistake or as a result of poor advice.


33.  In considering the administrative  review  decision  of  22nd  February
    2018 it is perhaps difficult to understand precisely the  reasoning  of
    the Secretary of State.  In one part of the decision he is saying:-


         "However your application has not fallen for refusal on the grounds
         that you have  supplied  false  information/documents,  nor  is  it
         implied within your initial decision".


34.  More specifically there would seem to be an express disavowment of  the
    contention that the  main  applicant  was  dishonest,  the  wording  as
    follows:-


     "However, your application has not been refused due to  allegations  of
         deceit or deception as this would mean your  application  had  been
         refused under paragraph 322(1)(a) or 322(2).  Therefore,  there  is
         no burden of proof that rests on the Secretary  of  State  and  the
         cited case laws are irrelevant".


35.  Miss Idelbi submits that that is merely a response  to  the  criticisms
    offered of the decision in the applicant's grounds  for  administrative
    review and did not denote  any  change  on  the  issue  of  dishonesty.
    Indeed, she submits that the administrative decision should be read  in
    the context of the main decision.  It seems to me, however,  that  such
    flies in the face of a very clear statement to the  contrary  that  has
    been made.


36.  The decision in respect of 322(5) is  reflected  as  in  the  following
    passage from the decision, namely:-


     "You argue that you should not have been refused under  general  ground
         322(5) as you believe you do not fall into this category and submit
         that there are more reasons for you to remain in the UK.   However,
         when  considering  the  application   at   paragraph   322(5)   the
         caseworkers correctly noted that this is not  a  mandatory  refusal
         and it was also considered paragraph  322(5)  is  a  suitable  rule
         which may be used in  a  wide  range  of  cases.   The  caseworkers
         correctly identified undesirable conduct and therefore 322(5) would
         be an appropriate rule when considering its conduct".


37.  It is difficult to understand what such undesirable conduct  might  be,
    nowhere seemingly is it defined.


38.  If that conduct was dishonesty  then  that  should  have  been  clearly
    indicated and maintained. Clearly it  was  the  responsibility  of  the
    applicant to submit  accurate  accounts.   There  may  well  have  been
    carelessness or inattention.   That would not, however,  be  sufficient
    it would seem on the authorities  to  constitute  a  proper  ground  to
    deprive  an  individual  of  an  opportunity  for  citizenship  or  for
    indefinite leave to remain.


39.  It seems to me that if the  Secretary  of  State  was  maintaining  the
    dishonesty in  322(5),  such  should  have  been  stated  with  greater
    clarity.  A further matter arises and that is the statement as recorded
    above, namely that as the Secretary of State was not relying on  deceit
    or deception, there was no burden of proof resting upon  the  Secretary
    of State.  It is clear that the burden of proof does rest firmly on the
    respondent to make good his allegation.   It  is  not  lawful  for  the
    respondent to decide not to rely on deception and therefore  avoid  the
    burden of proving deception but then to decide the case in a  way  that
    essentially relates to it being a decision based  on  deception,  which
    the respondent does not  have  to  prove.   That  seems  to  me  to  be
    irrational and unfair.


40.  Having regard to the administrative review decision, it  does  seem  to
    me that the respondent has  made  clear  that  he  has  not  relied  on
    deception but has not explained at all why the detected  and  corrected
    discrepancies make the main applicant unsuitable.  In the circumstances
    this failure undermines the lawfulness of the decision.  If the  reason
    for the decision is not deception and the respondent says  it  is  not,
    then the decision simply cannot stand.


41.  In terms of the overall assessment of the  merits  of  the  application
    consideration must be had as to whether or not the main applicant meets
    the requirements in  paragraph  245CD  of  the  Immigration  Rules  and
    paragraphs 19(i) and 19(j) of Appendix A.


42.  In terms of Appendix A the Secretary of State must  be  satisfied  that
    the earnings are from genuine employment.  In  making  that  assessment
    the Secretary of State must take into account a number of factors  that
    are set out.


43.   Such  includes  the  verification  of  previous  earning  claims  with
    declarations made in respect  of  the  applicant  to  other  Government
    departments, including declarations made in respect of earnings claimed
    by the  applicant in previous applications.  There  are  however  other
    factors that need to be borne in mind.  There  is  no  indication  that
    those factors were considered.  Indeed, in the original decision it  is
    stated:-


      "Please  note,  on  this  occasion  we  have  not  carried  out   full
         verification checks to ensure the authenticity of the documents you
         have submitted or  the  statements  that  you  have  made  on  your
         application form or in your interview as your application falls for
         refusal on the grounds as outlined above".


44.  If, as I have found the decision in relation to  322(5)  is  irrational
    and unlawful, it is  necessary  to  properly  consider  and  apply  the
    factors set out in the Immigration Rules as to the earnings and whether
    such satisfy the requirements for leave.  I find that that has not been
    done on this occasion.  The rejection of the documents as submitted  by
    the applicant in support of his application  for  indefinite  leave  to
    remain was not made in accordance with the proper  lawful  approach  to
    the fact-finding task which  lay  before  the  Secretary  of  State  in
    relation to the application.


45.  I remind myself that the issue before me is to  determine  the  whether
    the decisions of the respondent, particularly as to Rule  322(5),  were
    rational and lawful.  Fundamental to the fairness of any system is  for
    the applicant to understand with clarity the basis  upon  which  it  is
    made.  Given the contradictions, as between the first decision and  the
    second, in the light particularly of what  I  find  to  be  an  express
    disavowal of the concept of dishonesty and deceit, it is  difficult  to
    understand the proper basis upon which a decision as to Rule 322(5) has
    been reached.  As indicated I find that the decision is both irrational
    and unlawful.


46.  It follows therefore that I quash  the  decisions  and  grant  judicial
    review.

I do not grant leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.  This  is  a  factual
    issue and not one involving any wider issue of public importance. I  am
    aware that the Court of Appeal has considered similar cases in  January
    2019 and that judgement is awaited.


The Respondent shall pay the costs of the applicant to be  assessed  if  not
    agreed.
