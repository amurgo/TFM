                                  DECISION

      1. The parties having  consented,  in  accordance  with  the  Tribunal
         Procedure (Upper Tribunal)  Rules  2008  paragraph  40(3)(b),  that
         there is an error of law in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal
         such that the decision is set  aside  to  be  remade  and  that  no
         written reasons are required, I remit this appeal to the First-tier
         Tribunal for First-tier Tribunal Judge  McDonald  to  conclude  his
         determination by considering AA (Iraq) v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 944.




      2. It is not anticipated that oral  evidence  will  be  required,  the
         findings of fact  made  by  First-tier  Tribunal  judge  not  being
         challenged. Leave is however  given,  if  it  be  needed,  for  the
         parties to file and serve further country background  material,  if
         so advised. Such material to be field and served no later  than  10
         days before the reconvened hearing.
