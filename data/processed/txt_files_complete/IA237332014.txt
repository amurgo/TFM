For the Appellant:     Mr Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr Burrett, Counsel instructed by Woodford Wise
                    Solicitors

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

The Respondent is a national of Pakistan date of birth  10th  January  1980.
On the 18th December 2014 the First-tier  Tribunal  (Judge  Morgan)  allowed
his appeal against a decision to refuse to vary his leave to remain  and  to
remove him from the United  Kingdom  pursuant  to  s47  of  the  Immigration
Asylum  and  Nationality  Act  2006.   The  Secretary  of  State   now   has
permission[1] to appeal.


Background

Mr Khanzada came to the United Kingdom  in  September  2009  with  leave  to
enter as a student, which was subsequently varied as  he  became  a  Tier  1
(Post Study Work) Migrant. The application  giving  rise  to  the  presently
appealed decision was a further  application  to  vary,  this  time  in  the
capacity of a Tier 2 (General) Migrant.   The  Secretary  of  State  refused
leave with reference to Appendix A  and  J  of  the  Immigration  Rules.  Mr
Khanzada had submitted a Certificate of Sponsorship from his  employer,  but
the occupation code shown did not correlate  to  his  salary.  He  therefore
failed to attract  the  requisite  points  under  the  heading  'Appropriate
Salary'. The application was further refused with reference  to  Appendix  C
because  Mr  Khanzada  had  failed  to  supply   the   specified   documents
demonstrating that he was in possession of sufficient funds.

The First-tier Tribunal accepted that before the decision had been taken  on
the on the 20th May 2014 Mr Khanzada had submitted  a  further  letter  from
his employer clarifying  that  they  had  written  the  wrong  code  on  the
original certificate. His salary did correspond to the correct code  and  he
should therefore have been awarded his points under Appendix A.  The  First-
tier Tribunal made no finding in respect of Appendix C but  instead  allowed
the appeal on the grounds that the decision was "not in accordance with  the
law"  because  the  Secretary  of  State  had  failed   to   consider   this
correspondence:  "fairness  dictates  that  the  respondent  be  given   the
opportunity to properly consider this application".

The Secretary of State appeals on the ground that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
erred in the following material respects:

        i) The late evidence should have been excluded under  s85A  of  the
           Nationality, Immigration and  Asylum  Act  2002  unless  certain
           circumstances applied; the  determination  contains  no  finding
           about whether such circumstances did apply, nor any reasons  why
           it had been accepted that this letter  had  in  fact  been  sent
           prior to the decision being made.


       ii) The refusal notice contained two grounds for  refusal.  Even  if
           the decision in respect of Appendix  A  could  be  shown  to  be
           flawed, the application still fell to be refused under  Appendix
           C so it should never have been 'remitted' to  the  Secretary  of
           State.


Error of Law

Before me Mr Burrett relied on Nasim and Ors (Raju: reasons not to  follow?)
[2013] UKUT 00610(IAC) and in particular the dicta summarised at (4) of  the
headnote:


         (4)  As held in Khatel  and  others  (s85A;  effect  of  continuing
         application)  [2013]  UKUT  00044  (IAC),  section   85A   of   the
         Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 precludes a  tribunal,
         in  a  points-based  appeal,  from  considering  evidence   as   to
         compliance with points-based Rules, where  that  evidence  was  not
         before the Secretary of State when she took her decision;  but  the
         section does not prevent a tribunal from considering evidence  that
         was before the Secretary of  State  when  she  took  the  decision,
         whether or not that evidence reached her only  after  the  date  of
         application for the purposes of paragraph 34F  of  the  Immigration
         Rules.

He submitted that the Judge had been entitled on the evidence before him  to
find that the letter amending  the  occupation  code  had  been  before  the
Secretary of State  prior to the 20th May 2014 when the  decision  had  been
taken.    It is clear from paragraph 4 of  the  determination  that  he  had
applied the appropriate standard of  proof  and  that  he  had  accepted  Mr
Khanzada's evidence.

Mr Khanzada's evidence is set  out  in  his  witness  statement  dated  26th
November 2014.     He refers to the employer's letter dated  6th  May  2014,
also produced in the bundle,  and attests that this was  sent  to  the  Home
Office that day.

I agree with Mr Burrett that the Judge was entitled to accept that  evidence
and find that the document was before the Secretary of State on the date  of
decision. It is not an error of law to accept the evidence of a witness.

Where I part company with Mr Burrett  is  about  the  significance  of  that
matter. It was his  case  that  having  identified  that  the  decision  was
otherwise than in accordance with the law, the  Tribunal  was  entitled,  in
fact  obliged,  to  send  it  back  to  the  Secretary  of  State  for   her
consideration. It mattered not whether the  appellant  had  established  his
case with reference to Appendix C. If  the  Secretary  of  State  wished  to
maintain the refusal on that ground, that was up to her and she could do  so
as part of her reconsideration.  I cannot agree. Nasim is authority for  the
proposition that the Tribunal is entitled to have regard  to  material  that
was before the decision maker at the date of decision, in order  to  resolve
a matter in issue between the parties. It is not authority for the  Tribunal
to remit cases to the Secretary of State that have no hope of  success.  The
Tribunal may  have  considered  that  the  Secretary  of  State   had  acted
unfairly in ignoring the employer's second letter, but that did  not  assist
Mr Khanzada in dealing with the second ground of refusal. If  he  could  not
discharge the burden in respect of Appendix C, there was  no  point  in  his
case going back to the Secretary of State.   Accordingly  I  find  that  the
First-tier Tribunal erred in its approach and the decision is set  aside.  I
preserve the findings of fact about the employer's letter.

In re-making the decision I gave  Mr  Khanzada  an  opportunity  to  produce
evidence and make submissions about whether he had met the  requirements  of
Appendix C at the date of decision.


The Re-Made Decision

The  parties  agreed  that  Appendix  C  required  Mr  Khanzada  to  provide
specified evidence with his application  that  he  had  held  the  requisite
funds (said to be �900) for a continuous period of  90  days,   that  period
ending within the month  preceding  the  application.  The  application  was
lodged on the 17th April 2014.

The  Secretary  of  State's  bundle  contains  those  documents  which   the
Secretary of State contends were submitted with the application. There is  a
single Barclays Bank statement covering the period 8th  March  2014  to  the
8th April 2014.

Mr Khanzada's  bundle  contains  more  Barclays  statements.  There  is  one
covering the period 7th December 2013 to 8th  January  2014,  another  dated
9th January to 7th February, and one from the 8th  February  to  7th  March.
The balance is consistently higher than �900 in credit.

The question before me is whether I  can  be  satisfied,  on  a  balance  of
probabilities, that these  bank  statements  were  all  submitted  with  the
application as is now claimed, or whether, as Mr Avery  contends,  the  only
statement submitted was the single month shown in the Secretary  of  State's
bundle.

Mr Khanzada gave oral evidence. He told me that on the 17th  April  2014  he
had submitted the statements covering January, February and  March  2014.  I
bear in mind that Mr Khanzada has already been found to be credible  by  the
First-tier Tribunal and that since these documents do exist it is of  course
possible that they were indeed before the Secretary of State  when she  took
her decision.

However on balance, I am not satisfied that it has  been  demonstrated  that
this was in fact the case. That is because all of the rest of  the  evidence
indicates that there was only one statement submitted with  the  application
on the 17th April 2014. The last page of the  application  form  contains  a
'checklist' for applicants to  complete  showing  what  documents  they  are
submitting with their applications. Mr Khanzada has  indicated  that  he  is
submitting '01' bank statement.  The grounds of  appeal  to  the  First-tier
Tribunal refers to a "bank statement" in the singular. It would appear  from
the determination that this claim formed  no  part  of  Mr  Khanzada's  case
before the First-tier Tribunal; had it been his case that the  Secretary  of
State had simply failed to reproduce all of the relevant evidence  of  funds
in her bundle, I would have expected that to be argued before the  Tribunal.
 That it was not is demonstrated by the  witness  statement,  which  nowhere
asserts that the statements were sent in with the application. I  note  that
by contrast that statement deals extensively with the Secretary of State  's
failure to take the employer's letter into account.

I cannot be satisfied on the  balance  of  probabilities  that  Mr  Khanzada
provided with his application bank statements showing the requisite 90  days
of funds. Although he has now produced such evidence, I  am  precluded  from
having regard to it by s85A.  He  has  therefore  failed  to  show  that  he
should have been awarded 10 points under Appendix C and the appeal  must  be
dismissed under the Rules.




Decision

The determination contains an error of law and it is set aside.

I re-make the decision in the appeal by dismissing it under the  Immigration
Rules.

I make no direction for anonymity.
