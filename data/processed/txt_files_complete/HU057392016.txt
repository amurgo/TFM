                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Specialist Appeals Team appeals from the decision of the First-tier
    Tribunal (Judge C.  Burns  sitting  at  Birmingham  on  6  June  2017),
    allowing on human rights grounds  the  claimant's  appeal  against  the
    decision of an Entry Clearance Officer  ("ECO")  to  refuse  her  entry
    clearance as a spouse of a British national. The Judge found  that  she
    had not previously contrived in a  significant  way  to  frustrate  the
    intentions of the Rules; and that, although she  had  not  provided  an
    employment letter for her spouse which complied  with  Appendix  FM-SE,
    the refusal was disproportionate because other evidence showed that her
    spouse was earning more than ï¿½18,600 per  annum  and  also  there  were
    insurmountable obstacles to family  life  being  carried  on  in  India
    because her spouse, "lives with  and  cares  for  his  mother  who  has
    various disabilities including a significant and enduring mental health
    problem".

 2. The First-tier Tribunal did not make an anonymity direction, and  I  do
    not consider that such a direction is required for these proceedings in
    the Upper Tribunal.

Relevant Background

 3. The claimant is a national of India, whose date of birth is 25  October
    1978.  She came to the United Kingdom as a student migrant on  1  March
    2011. Her leave ran until  18  July  2012.  According  to  the  refusal
    decision, she applied  for  leave  to  remain  on  27  July  2012.  The
    application was refused, but allowed on appeal, and she  was  given  60
    days to find a new sponsor. On 8 October 2014 the appellant was refused
    leave to remain as she did not have a valid CAS.

 4. For the purposes of the application for leave to remain made on 27 July
    2012 or sometime  later  (the  chronology  is  unclear),  the  claimant
    submitted a TOEIC certificate from ETS in respect of  a  speaking  test
    purportedly undertaken at South Quay College on 22 August 2012.

 5. On 27 February 2015 the claimant was issued with an  IS15A  notice  for
    obtaining a previous grant of leave by deception. On 13 July  2015  the
    claimant voluntarily departed from the  UK.  On  9  February  2016  she
    applied for entry clearance as a spouse.

 6. The application was refused on 16  February  2016  on  suitability  and
    financial grounds. She had  submitted  her  TOEIC  certificate  to  her
    sponsor to obtain a CAS. ETS had a record of her speaking  test.  Using
    voice verification software, ETS was  able  to  detect  when  a  single
    person was undertaking multiple tests. ETS had checked her test and had
    confirmed that there was significant  evidence  to  conclude  that  the
    certificate was fraudulently obtained by the use of a proxy test taker.
    Her scores from the test taken on 22 August 2012 had now been cancelled
    by ETS.  On the basis of the information provided by ETS, the Secretary
    of State was satisfied that her certificate was fraudulently obtained.

The Hearing Before, and the Decision of, the First-tier Tribunal

 7. Both parties were legally represented before Judge Burns. The  ECO  had
    not filed any evidence to support the  case  of  deception.  The  Judge
    received oral evidence from the Appellant's husband, and her  attention
    was directed to SM and Qadir (ETS-Evidence-Burden of Proof) [2018] UKUT
    21 (IAC).

 8. In her subsequent decision, she concluded at paragraph  [24]  that  the
    ECO had not established on the balance of probabilities that  deception
    had been employed by the claimant.  She  addressed  the  issue  of  the
    claimant's overstaying at paragraphs [25] to [30], and she concluded at
    paragraphs [31] and [32] that the ECO had not shown that  the  claimant
    should be excluded on suitability grounds.

The Reasons for the Grant of Permission to Appeal

 9. On 29 December 2017, Judge Ransley granted the ECO permission to appeal
    to the Upper Tribunal as it was arguable: (1) that the Judge failed  to
    give adequate reasons for finding that the ECO had not  discharged  the
    burden of proof on the issue of deception; (2) that the Judge failed to
    give  adequate  weight  to  the  claimant's  inability  to   meet   the
    requirements  of  Appendix  FM-SE;  and  (3)  that  her   findings   on
    proportionality were tainted by her erroneous findings on the issue  of
    deception.

The Hearing in the Upper Tribunal

10. At the hearing to determine whether an error of law was  made  out,  Ms
    Brocklesby-Weller developed the case put forward in the grounds.  After
    hearing from Mr Khan and from Ms Brocklesby-Weller in reply, and  after
    reviewing the evidence that was before the First-tier Tribunal,  I  was
    not persuaded that an error of law was made out. I gave my reasons  for
    so finding orally, and my fuller reasons are set out below.

Reasons for Finding No Error of Law

11. The ratio decidendi of SM  and  Qadir  is  that,  despite  the  serious
    shortcomings in the evidence relied on by the Secretary  of  State,  it
    was sufficient to discharge the evidential burden of  raising  a  prima
    facie case, such that the evidential burden shifted to SM and Qadir  to
    produce  an  innocent  explanation  for  their   test   results   being
    invalidated by ETS.

12. Of particular significance are the following passages in the decision:

         68.  As our analysis and conclusions in the  immediately  preceding
         section make clear, we  have  substantial  reservations  about  the
         strength and quality of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence.   Its
         shortcomings are manifest. On the other hand, while bearing in mind
         that the context is one of alleged deception, we must be mindful of
         the comparatively  modest  threshold  which  an  evidential  burden
         entails. This calls for an evaluative assessment on the part of the
         tribunal. By an admittedly narrow margin we are satisfied that  the
         Secretary of State has discharged this burden.  The effect of  this
         is that there  is  a  burden,  again  an  evidential  one,  on  the
         Appellants of raising an innocent explanation.


         ...


         78.  The events of 2012 are of  obvious  significance.   The  TOEIC
         Certificate was, on its face, obtained by this Appellant [SM] after
         undergoing the necessary testing on two separate dates, 20  and  26
         March 2012.  We acknowledge that, in the abstract, his score in the
         modules of listening and reading is very high indeed, being 930 out
         of a possible 990 (circa 90%).  In  the  modules  of  speaking  and
         writing the scores recorded are also high, being  160/200  in  each
         instance (circa 80%).  Duly armed with his TOEIC Certificate,  this
         Appellant applied for leave to remain in the United  Kingdom.   His
         application was refused, giving rise to a hearing before the First-
         tier Tribunal ("FtT") on 05 September 2012.


         79.  We consider  this  aspect  of  the  evidence  to  be  of  some
         significance.  From the Tribunal's determination  one  learns  that
         this Appellant attended  the  hearing,  gave  evidence,  was  cross
         examined and was re-examined. No interpreter was required and there
         is no indication of the slightest difficulty  in  communication  or
         comprehension.   We  note  further  that  during  the   period   of
         (approximately) September 2010  to  February  2012  this  Appellant
         claims that he was pursuing courses at two colleges simultaneously,
         which we accept.   We  infer  from  this  fact,  coupled  with  the
         successful outcomes, that his mastery of English was of a high  and
         progressively improving level.


         80.  We consider that in appeals of this nature  evidence  of  this
         kind is likely to be of substantially  greater  force  and  cogency
         than the  tribunal's  own  assessment  of  an  appellant's  English
         language proficiency based on performance at  the  appeal  hearing.
         This is especially pertinent in the present case, given  that  some
         three years have  elapsed  since  this  Appellant  claims  to  have
         secured his TOEIC certificate. In some of the FtT decisions in this
         field one finds observations concerning  the  appellant's  apparent
         fluency in, and command of, the English language.  We consider that
         Judges should be cautious in adopting this approach  for  at  least
         three reasons.  The first is the passage of time.   The  second  is
         that Judges are not language testing or linguistics  experts.   The
         third is that,  to  date,  there  has  been  no  expert  linguistic
         evidence in any of these cases.


         ...


         101. We have already held  that  the  evidential  burden  of  proof
         resting on the Secretary of State  has  been  narrowly  discharged.
         For the reasons which we have given, we  are  satisfied  that  both
         Appellants have discharged their  burden  of  raising  an  innocent
         explanation of the prima facie indications of  deception  on  their
         part  in  the  Secretary  of  State's  evidence.  For  the  reasons
         elaborated, we conclude, without hesitation, that the Secretary  of
         State has failed to establish, on  the  balance  of  probabilities,
         that the Appellants' prima facie innocent explanations  are  to  be
         rejected. The legal burden of proof falling  on  the  Secretary  of
         State has not been discharged. The Appellants are clear winners.

  13. In Secretary of State for the Home Department and (1) Muhammad Shehzad
      and (2)  MD  Chowdhury  [2016]  EWCA  Civ  615,  the  finding  by  the
      Presidential panel at paragraph [68] was endorsed by higher  and  thus
      binding authority.  Beatson LJ, giving the  leading  judgment  of  the
      court, summarised the central issue which the court was addressing  at
      paragraph [19]:

         These appeals are only concerned with whether their  evidence  (the
         generic evidence of Mr Millington and Ms Collings  regarding  ETS's
         analysis of the  spoken  English  component  of  the  TOEIC  test),
         together with evidence that  the  tests  of  the  individual  under
         consideration  has  been  assessed  as  'invalid'  rather  than  as
         'questionable' because of problems at the test centre, suffices  to
         satisfy the evidential burden of showing dishonesty  that  lies  on
         the Secretary of State and to impose an evidential  burden  on  the
         individual to raise an innocent explanation.  The  question  before
         us is thus not the ultimate reliability  of  the  evidence  or  the
         ultimate disposition of the appeals.


  14. In Mr Chowdhury's case, discussed by Beatson LJ at paragraphs [24] and
      [25], the first instance judge held there was no evidence  identifying
      Mr Chowdhury as a person whose test was invalid.   But  in  fact,  the
      evidence included a screenshot of the results which stated  that  this
      was the position.  The same first instance judge held there  could  be
      multiple reasons for invalidation, some of  which  might  not  involve
      fraud or deception.  Beatson LJ went on to hold that  both  the  first
      instance judge and the Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge who dealt with  the
      appeal to the Upper Tribunal  had  misunderstood  the  nature  of  the
      evidence.  Beatson LJ continued in paragraph [26]:

         The reason for the misunderstandings by the Tribunals may  be  that
         the language used  by  Mr  Millington  and  Ms  Collings  in  their
         statements to explain a technical process is not altogether  clear.
         But, whatever the reason, in these circumstances,  in  my  judgment
         the in limine rejection of the Secretary  of  State's  evidence  as
         even sufficient to shift the evidential burden was an error of law.


15. The feature which distinguishes this appeal from the general run of ETS
    appeals is that the ECO failed to serve any  evidence  to  support  the
    allegation of deception. Not only was there no generic evidence from Mr
    Millington and Ms Collings but, crucially, there no  specific  evidence
    that ETS had assessed the claimant's test as invalid. So the ECO failed
    to satisfy the evidential burden of showing dishonesty.

16. The Judge did not decide the issue on the above basis, but  assumed  in
    the ECO's favour that there was an evidential onus on the  claimant  to
    provide an innocent explanation. She noted that the claimant had passed
    an English language  test  in  2011  (she  achieved  5.0  in  speaking,
    equivalent to level CEFR B1, in an IELTS test taken on 19 January 2011)
    and she accepted the claimant's evidence that she had subsequently  sat
    and passed a more demanding English language  test.  (Included  in  the
    bundle before her was an IELTS test of 4 May 2016 in which the claimant
    had again achieved level CEFR B1 in speaking.) She concluded  that  the
    claimant had sufficient proficiency to pass the speaking test in August
    2012, and she held that it was not "logical" for her to cheat given her
    proficiency.

17. Ms Brocklesby-Weller relies on MA (Nigeria) -v- Secretary of State  for
    the Home Department (ETS - TOEIC testing)  [2016]  UKUT  450  (IAC)  at
    [57], where the Upper Tribunal ("UT")  held  that  there  may  be  many
    reasons why persons proficient in English may engage  in  TOEIC  fraud.
    The  UT  found  that  the  claimant  had  not  provided   an   innocent
    explanation, and that his  case  was  a  fabrication  in  all  material
    respects: see paragraph [55].  At paragraph [57], the  UT  acknowledged
    the suggestion that MA had no reason to engage in the  deception  which
    they had found proven.  However, this had not deflected them in any way
    from reaching their main findings and conclusions: "We are not required
    to make the further finding of why the Appellant engaged  in  deception
    and to this we add that this issue was not explored during the hearing.
     We resist any temptation to speculate about this discrete matter."

18. The UT found against MA because, although he was proficient in English,
    he did not give a credible account of  actually  sitting  the  disputed
    test. It does not follow from MA that,  when  evaluating  a  claimant's
    explanation, the Tribunal is debarred  from  taking  into  account  the
    claimant's likely  ability  to  pass  the  ETS  speaking  test  without
    cheating - as shown by extrinsic evidence.  Indeed, this  is  precisely
    the approach which was adopted by the  Presidential  panel  in  SM  and
    Qadir at [79].

19. Accordingly, the Judge gave adequate reasons on  the  limited  evidence
    that was before her -  which  did  not  include  (a)  evidence  of  the
    speaking score achieved in the ETS test, and its  CEFR  equivalent,  or
    (b) specific evidence that the speaking score had been declared invalid
    by ETS - for finding that the ECO had  not  discharged  the  burden  of
    proving deception. Thus Grounds 1 and 3 fall away.

20. Ground 2 ignores the fact that the Judge's reasoning on proportionality
    included  the   highly   material   consideration   that   there   were
    insurmountable obstacles to family life being carried on in India,  and
    also that the public interest in immigration control had been  promoted
    by the claimant voluntarily returning to India in order  to  regularise
    her status.

21. I consider that the Judge gave adequate reasons for  holding  that  the
    refusal decision was disproportionate, and that Ground  2  is  no  more
    than  an  expression  of  disagreement  with  a  conclusion  that   was
    reasonably open to her on the evidence.



Notice of Decision

The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  allowing  this  appeal  on  human
rights grounds did  not  contain  an  error  of  law,  and  accordingly  the
decision stands.  This appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.

I make no anonymity direction.
