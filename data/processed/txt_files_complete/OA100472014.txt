                                   Between

                 SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                   Appellant

Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr C Avery, Senior Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    Mr R Ahmed (counsel) instructed by SBM solicitors
LLP


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.    I have considered whether any parties require  the  protection  of  an
anonymity direction. No anonymity direction was made previously  in  respect
of this Appellant. Having considered all the circumstances  and  evidence  I
do not consider it necessary to make an anonymity direction.

2.    The Secretary of State for the Home Department brings this appeal  but
in order to avoid confusion the parties are referred to as they were in  the
First-tier Tribunal. This is an appeal by the Secretary of State  against  a
decision of First-tier Tribunal Judge  O'Brien,  promulgated  on  03  August
2015, which allowed the Appellant's appeal.

Background

3.    The Appellant was born on 1st May 1991 and is a national of  Pakistan.
On 7 August 2014 the Secretary of State refused the Appellant's  application
for entry clearance as the partner of a person present and  settled  in  the
UK because the entry clearance officer was not satisfied that the  financial
requirements of appendix  FM  were  met,  nor  that  sufficient  documentary
evidence was provided to satisfy the requirements of appendix FM-SE.

The Judge's Decision

4.     The  Appellant  appealed  to  the  First-tier  Tribunal.   First-tier
Tribunal  Judge  O'Brien  ("the  Judge")  allowed  the  appeal   under   the
Immigration Rules.

5.    Grounds of appeal were lodged and on  16  December  2015  Judge  Keane
gave permission to appeal stating inter alia

    ".... The Judge made an arguable error  of  law  in  failing  to  apply
    paragraph 1(n) of appendix FM-SE to HC 395 (as amended). Rather, if the
    Judge's decision at paragraphs 18 to 21 inclusive and  particularly  at
    paragraph 21 is read with care he  accorded  weight  to  the  sponsor's
    evidence that he received payment in cash from Tariq Petroleum  UK  Ltd
    between January and April 2014 in the sum of �631 each month  as  going
    towards satisfaction of the financial requirements of appendix FM (from
    which the sponsor was not exempt). Arguably, the  Judge  did  not  take
    into  account  a  relevant  consideration  namely  the  provisions   of
    paragraph 1(n) of appendix FM-SE but rather had regard to an irrelevant
    consideration namely the sponsor's evidence tendered at the hearing."

The Hearing

6.    Mr Avery moved the grounds of appeal and told me  that  the  appellant
simply could not succeed in terms of the rules. He referred me to  paragraph
1(n) of appendix FM-SE, and told me that at [18] the Judge takes account  of
the sponsor's oral evidence that he had received payments in cash  from  his
employer which had not been paid into his bank  account,  whereas  paragraph
1(n) dictates that only the net amount shown on  specified  bank  statements
may be counted. He urged me  to  set  the  decision  aside  and  remake  the
decision by dismissing the  appeal,  offering  the  opinion  that  the  best
option for the appellant is to gather his financial information  and  submit
a fresh application.

7.    Mr Ahmed, counsel  for  the  appellant,  candidly  conceded  that  the
decision contains a material error of law and that he could not  resist  the
submission made by Mr Avery. He asked that I preserve the positive  findings
made by the Judge and, in the light of [23] of the decision, remit the  case
to the respondent  with  a  recommendation  that  the  respondent  exercises
discretion in the appellant's favour

Analysis

8.    It is now common ground that the decision  in  this  case  contains  a
material error of law. The Judge found that the appellant's income  is  more
than �18,600 per annum, but this calculation does not take  account  of  the
evidential requirements of paragraph 1(n) of  appendix  FM-SE.  The  Judge's
findings at [21] to [23] ignore paragraph 1(n), which says

    "1.    In relation to evidencing the financial requirements in Appendix
    FM the following general provisions shall apply:

         ...

         (n)      The gross amount of any cash income may be  counted  where
         the person's specified bank statements show the  net  amount  which
         relates to the gross amount shown on  their  payslips  (or  in  the
         relevant specified evidence provided in addition to  the  specified
         bank statements in relation to non-employment  income).  Otherwise,
         only the net amount shown on the specified bank statements  may  be
         counted."

9.    As it is conceded  that  the  appellant  cannot  meet  the  evidential
requirements of paragraph FM-SE  the  Judge's  conclusion  that  the  appeal
should be allowed under the  Immigration  Rules  cannot  be  sustained.  The
Judge's failure to pay heed to paragraph 1(n) of appendix FM-SE  means  that
his conclusions between [18] and [25] of the  decision  contain  a  material
error of law. The Judge's conclusion at [25] that  the  appellant  satisfies
paragraph E-ECP3.1 is wrong.

10.   Because the decision contains material errors of law I set  it  aside.
Because it is conceded that the appellant cannot satisfy paragraph  E-ECP3.1
I remake the decision by substituting the following decision.

11.    The  appellant  does  not  satisfy  the  evidential  requirements  of
appendix FM-SE. the appellant cannot therefore  satisfy  paragraph  E-ECP3.1
of the Immigration Rules. The respondent's decision  is  therefore  correct.
The appeal is dismissed under the immigration rules.

12.   In SS (Congo) and Others [2015] EWCA Civ 387   Lord  Justice  Richards
said at paragraph 33 "In our judgment, even though a test of  exceptionality
does not apply in every case falling within the scope of Appendix FM, it  is
accurate to say that the general  position  outside  the  sorts  of  special
contexts referred to above is that compelling circumstances  would  need  to
be identified to support a claim for grant of LTR outside the new  Rules  in
Appendix FM. In our view, that is a formulation which is not as strict as  a
test of exceptionality or a requirement of  "very  compelling  reasons"  (as
referred to in MF (Nigeria) in  the  context  of  the  Rules  applicable  to
foreign criminals), but  which  gives  appropriate  weight  to  the  focused
consideration  of  public  interest  factors  as  finds  expression  in  the
Secretary of State's formulation of the new Rules in Appendix  FM.  It  also
reflects the formulation in Nagre at para. [29], which has been  tested  and
has survived scrutiny in this court: see, e.g.,  Haleemudeen  at  [44],  per
Beatson LJ".

13.   Insufficient evidence is produced by the appellant to  establish  that
there are compelling circumstances which merit  considering  any  article  8
rights the appellant might have out-with the Immigration Rules.

Decision

14.   The decision is tainted  by  a  material  error  of  law.  I  set  the
decision aside.

15.   I substitute the following decision.

16.   The appeal is dismissed under the Immigration Rules

17.   The appeal is dismissed on article 8 ECHR grounds.
