                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background

1.    The appellant appealed against  the  respondent's  decision  dated  26
    March 2014 to refuse entry clearance as  the  spouse  of  Points  Based
    System Migrant (her husband is a Tier 1 (General) Migrant with leave to
    remain  until  23/01/17).  The  only  reason  given  for  refusing  the
    application was the fact that the sponsor's bank statement did not show
    the requisite level of �600 for a continuous  period  of  three  months
    prior to the application.

2.    The appeal was listed for hearing on 16 January 2015.  On  14  January
    2015 the Tribunal sent a notice to inform the appellant and the sponsor
    that the hearing had been adjourned. The notice  of  adjourned  hearing
    stated that the appeal was listed for hearing on Thursday 28  May  2015
    instead. It appears that the notice was sent to the appellant's address
    in Chennai and to the sponsor's address in the UK.

3.    There was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  at  the
    hearing on 28 May 2015. First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Beg  ("the  judge")
    proceeded to determine the appeal because she was  satisfied  that  the
    hearing notice had been properly served. She went  on  to  dismiss  the
    appeal in a decision promulgated on 04 June 2015.  She  considered  the
    bank statement produced  with  the  application,  and  the  explanation
    provided in the grounds of appeal as to why the funds had fallen short,
    but concluded that it was still the case that the evidence did not meet
    the requirements of Appendix E of the immigration rules.

4.    The appellant appealed the decision on the ground that  she  was  told
    two days before the hearing on 16 January 2015 not to attend. They  did
    not receive any  further  communication  from  the  Tribunal  and  were
    unaware of the further hearing that  took  place.  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge Colyer granted permission to appeal to the Upper Tribunal on  the
    ground that it was arguable that there wasn't a fair  hearing  if  they
    did not receive the hearing notice.

Decision and reasons

5.    There was no appearance by or  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  at  the
    hearing today. No explanation was provided for the sponsor's absence. I
    was satisfied that the file showed that a hearing notice  was  sent  to
    the address given on the appeal form  (the  appellant's  correspondence
    address now being the sponsor's address).

6.    The notice of adjourned hearing  dated  14  January  2015  is  on  the
    Tribunal file. The date is consistent with the short  notice  that  the
    appellant said she received of the  adjourned  hearing  because  it  is
    dated two days before the scheduled hearing. It is  unclear  whether  a
    member of staff also telephoned the appellant  or  her  sponsor  on  14
    January 2015 to inform them that the hearing on  16  January  2015  had
    been adjourned.  The  notice  was  sent  to  the  appellant's  and  the
    sponsor's addresses. There is nothing on the file to indicate  that  it
    wasn't sent out in accordance with the usual Tribunal procedure. It  is
    of course possible that  there  could  have  been  an  error  and,  for
    whatever reason, the hearing notice might not have been sent out.  Less
    likely is the possibility that neither the appellant  nor  the  sponsor
    received the notice due to a postal issue.

7.    If there was any evidence to show that the  appellant  was  likely  to
    have been prejudiced by lack of notification of the hearing on  28  May
    2015 I might have taken a view. However,  in  this  case  there  is  no
    evidence to show that the appellant had been preparing for  the  appeal
    hearing on 16 January  2015.  No  further  evidence  was  sent  to  the
    Tribunal in preparation for the hearing.  The  appellant's  grounds  of
    appeal explained that her husband had recent expenses that  meant  that
    the balance in his account had dropped below �600 during the  specified
    period  but  that  merely  served  to  explain  why  the  evidence  was
    inadequate. Nothing in the grounds of appeal  or  the  evidence  showed
    that the respondent had been wrong to refuse the  application  for  the
    reasons that she did. While it was unfortunate that the balance in  the
    sponsor's account dropped below the specified  level  of  funds  for  a
    short period in three months preceding the  date  of  the  application,
    because the  account  usually  maintained  a  healthy  balance,  it  is
    nevertheless  the  case  that  the  evidence  simply  didn't  meet  the
    requirements of the immigration rules.

8.    There was no appearance on behalf of the appellant at the hearing  and
    no further arguments have been put  forward  that  disclose  any  other
    material error of law in the First-tier Tribunal  decision.  Given  the
    passage of time it might well be the case that  the  appellant  made  a
    further application for  entry  clearance  rather  than  wait  for  the
    outcome of the appeal, in which case she  should  have  withdrawn  this
    appeal.

9.    For the reasons given above I conclude that,  even  if  the  appellant
    was unaware of the further hearing date, it is difficult  to  see  what
    the sponsor could have added in terms of evidence if  he  had  attended
    the hearing. Even if there is a perceived unfairness I find that it  is
    not material to the outcome of the appeal. The  bank  statement  simply
    didn't meet the requirements of the immigration rules  and  the  appeal
    would have been dismissed in any event.

10.   I conclude that the First-tier Tribunal decision did not  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law. The decision shall stand.

DECISION

The First-tier Tribunal decision did not involve the making of an  error  on
a point of law

The First-tier Tribunal decision shall stand
