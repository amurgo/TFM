For the Appellant:           Miss E Rutherford, instructed by Derby Law
Centre
For the Respondent:          Mr I Neal, Home Office Presenting Officer

A person who cannot meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules is
unlikely to be able to show that the decision was contrary to the
Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended) by reason of the sponsor's
disability or perhaps at all.


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

 1. The appellant, a citizen of Iraq, appealed to the Tribunal against  the
    decision of  the  respondent  on  23  March  2007  refusing  her  entry
    clearance to the United Kingdom as the spouse of a person  present  and
    settled here ("the sponsor").   The  Immigration  Judge  dismissed  the
    appeal.    The   appellant   sought   and   obtained   an   order   for
    reconsideration.  Thus the matter comes before us.

 2. We do not know the sponsor's immigration history in any detail, but  he
    comes from Iraq.  He claimed asylum in the United Kingdom, probably  in
    2000, and apparently successfully.  A grant of British  citizenship  to
    him is evident by his passport dated 1 March 2007.  In  the  spring  of
    2004 he was on holiday in  Iran,  staying  at  a  hotel.   He  met  the
    appellant there and, according to the evidence both from the  appellant
    and the sponsor, they immediately, on the day that they met, started  a
    relationship.  She says not merely that, but also that she  lived  with
    him as his fianc�e from then until 20 July 2004, which  was  presumably
    when one or the other of them left Iran.  They  remained  in  touch  by
    telephone and they were married by proxy in Iraq on 20 June  2006.   On
    that date the appellant was in Iraq and the sponsor was in  the  United
    Kingdom.  The sponsor and the appellant then both went on a holiday  to
    Syria and lived together  as  husband  and  wife  from  30  June  to  6
    September 2006.  They both then apparently returned home.  Although the
    present application was made shortly after the sponsor obtained British
    citizenship, and is said to be the appellant's first application, there
    is amongst the appellant's bundle  a  letter  to  the  Entry  Clearance
    Officer, Damascus dated 20 October 2006 and referring to an application
    for entry clearance being made to  that  officer  at  that  time.   The
    respondent has, however, taken no point on this.

 3. The sponsor is entirely reliant  upon  benefits.   He  receives  Income
    Support and Disability Living allowance,  both  of  which  are  "public
    funds" for the purposes of the Immigration  Rules,  because  they  fall
    within the definition of that phrase in para  6  in  the  Statement  of
    Changes in Immigration Rules HC  395.   Partly  for  that  reason,  the
    appellant included with her application declarations from a  number  of
    individuals who said they were prepared to support her.  At the time of
    the application to the  Entry  Clearance  Officer  in  Damascus,  those
    individuals were described as "five close family friends", but  so  far
    as this application is concerned there appears to have been no evidence
    of third party support before the Entry Clearance Officer, although the
    Immigration  Judge  in  due  course  heard  oral  evidence  from  three
    individuals.

 4. The Entry Clearance Officer refused the application  for  a  number  of
    reasons, set out in the notice of decision.  Following the  service  of
    the appellant's notice of appeal, the decision was  reviewed,  but  the
    decision that the respondent was not satisfied that the appellant could
    be adequately maintained and accommodated without  recourse  to  public
    funds was maintained.  There was an issue about  accommodation,  which,
    for reasons we will explain below, we do not need to set out here.  The
    two substantive paragraphs of the review read as follows:

        "3. The appellant states the sponsor's income is  higher  than  the
           minimum.  However, the level of income  support  and  Disability
           Living Allowance for the sponsor has been assessed according  to
           his individual need.  The  bank  statements  provided  with  the
           application showed reliance on additional funds and  an  account
           run down to just a few pounds.  As such he has little disposable
           income to support an additional adult regardless of whether  his
           income is deemed officially to be  higher  than  the  'minimum'.
           With this appeal, the appellant has now  submitted  up  to  date
           accounts.  These merely confirm  that  the  sponsor  spends  his
           entire income and is still dependent on  additional  funds  -  I
           note the two unexplained deposits each of �200 into the  account
           on 27th and 28th March for example.  I am  not  satisfied  still
           that  the  sponsor   can   accommodate   [meaning,   apparently,
           "maintain"] the appellant without  further  recourse  to  public
           funds.


        4. The appellant states I have failed  to  take  account  of  third
           party support on offer to the appellant.  However, there  is  no
           indication of any third party sponsorship whatsoever.   Even  if
           there were, third party offers are unenforceable and often  made
           purely to facilitate an application.  A third party can withdraw
           their support at any time.  Ultimately the  responsibility  lies
           with the sponsor to maintain his wife adequately."



 5. The part of the Immigration Rules that is of concern in this appeal  is
    para 281(v), which requires that as a person seeking admission  as  the
    spouse of a person settled and present in the United Kingdom must  show
    that:

        "The parties will be able to maintain themselves and any dependents
        adequately without recourse to public funds".


 6. At the hearing of the appeal before the Immigration  Judge,  there  was
    oral and documentary evidence.  The respondent was  unrepresented;  the
    appellant was represented by counsel.  The Immigration  Judge  accepted
    that the appellant was sending some money to his wife in Iraq, and  was
    able to do so because he "could live frugally".  She declined, however,
    to find that the sponsor's  income  was  sufficient  for  the  adequate
    maintenance of himself  and  his  wife  in  the  United  Kingdom.   She
    rejected the suggestion that there could be third party  support.   She
    accepted that the three individuals that appeared before  her  offering
    such support were honest and truthful, generous and genuine.  She found
    that they genuinely intended to offer short term financial  support  if
    necessary.  She referred to AK and others [2006]  UKAIT  00069  and  AM
    [2007] UKAIT 00058 and held that para 281 of HC  395  does  not  permit
    third party support.  She then looked at  a  job  offer  which  another
    individual had made to the appellant.  She said:

        "Despite the job offer..., I am not satisfied  that  the  appellant
        would immediately find work.  [The perspective  employer]  did  not
        attend at court, there was no indication in his letter  as  to  how
        long the job offer would be open and, indeed, I do not know whether
        or not the position had been filled by the  time  of  the  hearing.
        Further, even if the offer was genuine, there was no indication  as
        to the hours that the appellant would be able to work or the income
        she would be likely to derive from this job.   Therefore,  applying
        the balance of probabilities test, I  am  not  satisfied  that  the
        appellant  would  start  work  and  be  able  to  support   herself
        financially as soon as she arrived in the UK."

 7. The Immigration  Judge  then  looked  at  Article  8.   She  noted  the
    circumstances of the appellant and the sponsor and  of  their  marriage
    and of the contact since.  She remarked that "it must have been obvious
    to them that there would be very significant difficulties in them being
    able to live together", but that they "took the step of marrying".  She
    concluded that in the circumstances any interference in the appellant's
    private or family life resulting from the decision under  appeal  would
    be  proportionate.   She  then  dealt  briefly  with  an  argument   on
    disability  discrimination,  based  on  Article  14  of  the   European
    Convention on Human Rights and s 21B of the  Disability  Discrimination
    Act 1995 (as amended).  Her conclusion was as follows:

        "I do not find that the ECO's decision  discriminates  against  the
        Appellant because of the Sponsor's disability or disabilities.  The
        parties are discriminated against, in the  general  sense,  because
        the Sponsor is on benefits, irrespective of the  type  of  benefit.
        The fact that the Sponsor has recourse to public funds  means  that
        paragraph 281(v) operates against the parties  in  a  way  that  it
        would not if the Appellant were financially  self-sufficient.   The
        ECO's decision would be the same if the Sponsor was  simply  on  IS
        and not additionally in receipt of DLA".

 8. The  Immigration  Judge  made  no  specific  finding  on  questions  of
    accommodation.  She did not need to  because  she  was  dismissing  the
    appeal on other grounds.   In  fact,  however,  as  we  understand  the
    position, there  is  no  continuing  concern  about  the  accommodation
    requirements of the Immigration Rules.   The  Entry  Clearance  Officer
    appears to have been struck  by  a  difference  between  two  documents
    submitted  to  him,  but  it  is  clear  that  the  sponsor's   present
    accommodation could be occupied by him and his wife  without  statutory
    overcrowding.

 9.  The  grounds  for  review,  on  the  basis  on  which  the  order  for
    reconsideration was made,  raise  the  following  issues.   First,  the
    Immigration Judge ought not to have followed reported Tribunal cases on
    the interpretation on para 281 and whether  it  permitted  third  party
    support, but ought instead to have followed the decision  of  the  High
    Court on Judicial Review in R  (Arman  Ali)  v  SSHD  [2000]  INLR  89.
    Secondly, the Immigration Judge was wrong to consider whether there was
    a job available at the date of the hearing, because she  was  concerned
    with matters as they were at the date of the  decision.   Thirdly,  her
    decision in respect of Article 8 was defective in that  she  had  taken
    into account the circumstances of "war-torn countries and the like" and
    that if her reasoning was correct "not many would ever be able to  come
    to the UK".  Fourthly, the grounds assert that  the  Immigration  Judge
    failed  to  take  proper  account  of  the   argument   on   Disability
    Discrimination.  On that issue, the grounds read as follows:

        "As to paragraph 38 of the determination the issue was in  fact  an
        assessment of whether because the Sponsor receives DLA and  how  it
        affects the overall situation as he cannot work.   It  is  unlikely
        that he will ever be able to work.  If he can  never  work  and  if
        third party support is not  permitted  then  he  can  never  become
        financially able to meet the Immigration Rules.   In  the  premises
        the  Rules  are  not  Human  Rights  compliant   and   further   or
        alternatively, this issue of disability is of such significance  as
        to mean that Article 8 is  engaged  to  permit  the  Appellant  and
        Sponsor to live together in the UK.  Article 14 of the  HRA  is  of
        relevance too."

10. Miss Rutherford (who did not draft those grounds) elaborated on all  of
    them before us, in her  written  skeleton  argument  and  in  her  oral
    submissions.

11. We should begin by noting that no criticism is made of the  Immigration
    Judge's finding that  the  appellant  and  the  sponsor  could  not  be
    maintained adequately from the sponsor's present income.   It is  right
    that this should be so, even taking into account the  decision  of  the
    Court of Appeal in MK (Somalia) v SSHD [2007] EWCA Civ 1521 of which  a
    note   became   available   shortly   after   the   hearing   of   this
    reconsideration, but of which the full text was published  on  5  March
    2008.   It is not said, and we doubt if the  Tribunal  ever  has  said,
    that disability benefits are to be "ring fenced" and so unavailable  to
    anybody except their recipient.  But a person who receives benefits  on
    account of a disability may be assumed to be being paid them because he
    needs them; and in that context it will generally be difficult to  show
    that his maintenance will be  adequate  without  them.   There  may  be
    exceptional cases, but in general it ought not to be  possible  to  say
    that the adequate level of maintenance for an immigrant is fixed  at  a
    level lower than that for a British citizen.  That, however,  would  be
    the effect if benefits fixed at a level adequate for the maintenance of
    a disabled person were in addition to be available for the  maintenance
    of immigrant members of his family, whilst still giving all the members
    of that family an adequate level overall.   "Adequate"  would  then  be
    nearer to poverty for an immigrant family than  for  a  wholly  citizen
    family.  That way lies the development of ghettos.

12. The first ground for reconsideration suggests that it was an  error  of
    law for the Immigration Judge to follow recent authoritative  decisions
    of the Tribunal in preference to an old decision  of  the  High  Court.
    There is perhaps room for doubt on whether decisions of the High  Court
    on Judicial Review are formally binding on the Tribunal, but  there  is
    no doubt that a decision of the High Court on a relevant  matter  ought
    to be followed by an Immigration  Judge.   Arman  Ali  is  not  such  a
    decision.  The actual immigration decision in that case was made  under
    the Statement of Changes in the Immigration Rules  HC  251,  which  was
    replaced by the present code of Immigration Rules  in  1994.   Although
    Collins J's remarks in Arman Ali are directed to the interpretation  of
    HC 395, it does not appear that that was a matter  that  was,  strictly
    speaking, before him.  He looked  at  HC  395  in  order  to  test  the
    Secretary of State's assertion that he had  a  consistent  approach  to
    such issues.  Secondly, insofar as dependent  children  are  concerned,
    Collins J's  observations  have  been  reversed  by  amendment  to  the
    Immigration Rules.  Thirdly, Arman Ali predates the coming  into  force
    of the Human Rights Act 1998 and the review of Immigration  Rules  that
    took place to coincide with that event.  Great though  be  the  respect
    that any Immigration Judge ought to have to anything falling  from  the
    lips of Collins J's, particularly in this specialist field, it  appears
    to us that his decision in Arman  Ali  should  be  regarded  as  having
    little or no current application.  The Immigration Judge in the present
    appeal was right to follow recent Tribunal  authority  specifically  on
    the matter in question.  As it happens, since her decision,  and  since
    the hearing of this reconsideration, the Court of Appeal  has  endorsed
    that the Tribunal's interpretation in MW (Liberia) v SSHD  [2007]  EWCA
    Civ 1376 at [15].

13.  Even  if  that  had  not  been  the  case,  however,  there  are  very
    considerable difficulties about the offer of third party  support.   In
    cases where third party support is allowed, there is clearly a need  to
    ensure that it is genuinely available.  The level of  support  must  be
    clear, and the promise of support must go beyond the  most  genuine  of
    generosity: although no legally  binding  agreement  is  necessary,  it
    will,  generally  speaking,  be  necessary  to  show  that  the  person
    providing the support will give it priority over any other demands that
    may be made on his finances - for example, by his own family.  Only  so
    can a  decision  maker  (whether  official  or  Immigration  Judge)  be
    satisfied that the support "will be" available.  The  evidence  in  the
    present case falls lamentably short of showing that  support  would  be
    available at any particular level or with any degree  of  stability  or
    continuity.

14. There is a third problem which we have to say we are astonished was not
    drawn to the attention to the Immigration Judge by counsel who appeared
    before her; nor was it specifically drawn to  our  attention.   As  the
    Entry Clearance Officer in the present appeal notes, there was  at  the
    date of the decision no evidence of third party support.  The  evidence
    before the Immigration Judge consisted of witness  statements  made  in
    August 2007, five months after the  date  of  the  decision,  and  oral
    evidence from the makers of those statements.   Post-decision  evidence
    would have been insufficient to displace  the  decision  of  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer on the circumstances as they were at the date of  the
    decision, even if the evidence was in other respects adequate,  or  was
    on a matter which had any relevance to the application of the Rules.

15.  For those reasons we reject the first argument raised by the  grounds.
    The  second  is  similarly  surprising.   The  Immigration   Judge   is
    criticised for remarking that she did not know whether the job said  to
    be available to the appellant was still available at the  date  of  the
    hearing.  She is criticised because it is said  that  she  should  have
    been looking only at the date of the decision.  But there  was  no  job
    offer at all at the date of the decision.  The job offer is  also  made
    in two letters dated in August 2007.  There is no evidence  that  there
    was a job available to the appellant on the date of the  decision.   So
    far as the appellant is concerned, the evidence is to the contrary.  In
    her application form she said she intended to  work,  but  only  "after
    learning English".  If the job offer had been open at the date  of  the
    decision, it would  still  have  had  the  defects  identified  by  the
    Immigration Judge in  her  determination,  but  it  was  not:  and  the
    criticism of her treatment of it is,  in  the  circumstances,  entirely
    unmerited.

16. We turn now to the issue of Article 8, divorced  for  the  moment  from
    issues related to the sponsor's benefit payments.  The phrase "war-torn
    countries",  cited  in  the  grounds,  refers  to  a  passage  in   the
    Immigration  Judge's  discussion  of  the  issue,  leading  up  to  her
    conclusion on Article 8, which is as follows.

        "Exercising my  judgement,  I  find  that  in  not  granting  entry
        clearance the ECO deprived the  Appellant  and  the  Sponsor  of  a
        potentially new way of life together in  the  UK  and  a  style  of
        marriage where they could live together  (other  than  on  holiday)
        that they have never hitherto enjoyed.  Further, a novel  lifestyle
        together  which  they  knew  obtaining  would   be   fraught   with
        difficulties.  If it were capable of being measured,  their  family
        life together and shared experiences would be small, as of the date
        of refusal.  As against that, I can only presume  that  it  is  not
        unusual, never mind exceptional, for people from war-torn countries
        or countries such as Iraq, where there  is  serious  and  dangerous
        political upheaval, to meet and to  be  attracted  to  someone  who
        lives in a safe country.  Sadly, as there are many people  in  war-
        torn countries or countries undergoing upheaval,  I  find  ...  the
        refusal to be proportionate to the legitimate goal  of  Immigration
        control which  is  "workable,  predictable,  consistent,  fair  and
        effective so as to ensure  that  it  is  not  perceived  as  unduly
        porous".  In essence, if the ECO (and now I) were wrong in relation
        to this decision on Article 8, then, logically the effect would  be
        that  it  would  be  very  likely  that  paragraph  281  would   be
        circumvented very frequently by spouses from war-torn countries who
        had met whist living in different countries.  I find the  potential
        cost and effort of the State catering for the needs of such  people
        far outweighs the  personal  cost  to  the  parties  in  having  to
        continue their relationship in the way that they have been doing."

17. It may be that certain criticisms could be made of that paragraph:  but
    there is no doubt, that as a whole, it shows that the Immigration Judge
    was doing her best to weigh the competing interests of the public,  and
    immigration control, on the one hand, and the individual  circumstances
    of the appellant on the other.  She may have had in mind the notion  of
    "exceptionality", but it does not  appear  to  us  that  there  is  any
    obvious error of  law  in  her  approach.   We  therefore  confine  our
    consideration to the matters specifically raised by the grounds.  It is
    that, if the Immigration Judge's comments  on  this  type  of  case  in
    general were right, "not many would ever be able to come  to  the  UK".
    That, however, is to miss the point  of  the  issue  and  of  what  the
    Immigration Judge wrote.  Her remarks were made in the context of  para
    281.  There is no reason at all why very many people should be able  to
    come to this country in reliance on Article 8 alone.   Whether  or  not
    the cases in which a judgement of proportionality demands that a person
    be allowed entry clearance despite the provisions  of  the  Immigration
    Rules are called "exceptional", the assumption that such cases will  be
    rare is entirely consistent with high authority at all levels including
    that of the House of Lords in Huang [2007] UKHL 11.  The grounds appear
    to assume that such cases ought to be frequent and commonplace.


18. It does not appear to us that the Immigration Judge materially erred in
    her assessment of proportionality under Article 8,  as  argued  in  the
    grounds or at all.

19. We turn then to fourth  matter:  that  relating  to  an  allegation  of
    discrimination on grounds of disability.  We are sorry to say  that  we
    received little help from either of the parties on this  difficult  and
    novel point.  We have therefore had to do our  best  to  deal,  without
    such assistance, with an argument which, if it had any substance, might
    be of  general  importance.   We  have  concluded,  however,  that  the
    arguments raised do not establish a case which ought  to  require  this
    appeal to be allowed either under  the  provisions  of  the  Disability
    Discrimination Act or under Article 14 taken  with  Article  8  of  the
    European Convention on Human Rights.

20. We have indicated the way in which the matter was put  in  the  grounds
    for  reconsideration.   In  Miss  Rutherford's  skeleton  argument  the
    relevant passage is as follows:

        "The argument raised on the behalf of the Appellant was clear.  The
        sponsor is accepted to be disabled and  in  receipt  of  Disability
        Living Allowance (DLA) as a consequence.  He is unfit to  work  and
        he is unlikely to ever to be able to work.   As  a  consequence  if
        third party support is not allowed in his circumstances  he  simply
        cannot  satisfy  the  Immigration  Rules  as  they  stand  and  the
        Appellant and the sponsor will not be  able  to  live  together  as
        husband and wife.  This situation arises  because  the  sponsor  is
        disabled and therefore is  unlikely  to  ever  be  able  to  obtain
        employment.  Therefore the Appellant is unlikely  to  ever  satisfy
        paragraph 281 as the sponsor is unlikely to ever be in  a  position
        where he can demonstrate that he has sufficient  funds  to  support
        the Appellant adequately without the need for  recourse  to  public
        funds.  This it is submitted  contravenes  Article  14  ECHR  which
        requires that the fundamental freedoms protected by  the  ECHR  are
        applied equally and without discrimination to all persons.


        It is submitted that the Immigration Judge materially erred in  her
        assessment as to whether the  respondent's  decision  discriminates
        against the appellant because of  the  sponsor's  disability.   The
        Immigration Judge's findings at paragraph 38 of  the  determination
        failed to take into account the fact the  appellant  is  not  being
        discriminated against because he is receipt  of  public  funds  but
        because he is disabled he is unlikely ever to be in a  position  to
        obtain employment and therefore it cannot be said that he  can  put
        himself in a position where he would not be in  receipt  of  public
        funds.  Therefore it is due to his disability that he finds himself
        in this position.  It is therefore due to his disability  that  the
        appellant cannot satisfy the Immigration  Rules.   The  Immigration
        Judge has therefore materially erred in law by failing to  properly
        consider the appellant's claim under Article 8 and under Article 14
        ECHR."

21. Miss Rutherford mentioned the Disability Discrimination Act in  passing
    in an earlier paragraph of her skeleton and in similarly vague terms at
    the hearing.  Extracts from it, however, accompanied  the  grounds  for
    review and we have to assume that we  are  intended  to  take  it  into
    account in making our decision.  But it is very difficult indeed to see
    that that Act can assist the appellant.

22. There is, first, the difficulty  that  the  appellant  herself  is  not
    disabled.   Although  the  Act   makes   various   provisions   against
    discrimination on account of disability, it provides no benefits to the
    family members or carers of disabled people, who are not brought within
    the ambit of the Act.  Before us the appellant  is  the  only  possible
    party, because the sponsor is a British  citizen  and  not  within  the
    jurisdiction of this Tribunal that, insofar as the  Act  is  concerned,
    the sponsor is the one who would  have  to  make  any  relevant  claim.
    Secondly,  although  the  Act  applies  to  discrimination  by   public
    authorities, and although the definition of such  authorities  is  very
    wide, there is  no  clear  indication  that  it  applies  to  a  public
    authority abroad, even if operating under the Crown.  We asked  at  the
    hearing what the position was:  neither party was able  to  inform  us.
    As a result we have reached no view, but we note that it is unusual for
    a British statute to have  extra-territorial  effect  save  by  express
    provision.  In the present case the decision said to be  discriminatory
    was taken by a British official in Jordan.

23. Thirdly, despite Miss  Rutherford's  assertion  that  the  argument  on
    behalf of the appellant was clear, it is unfortunately clear neither in
    her written skeleton (which wavers rather between the appellant and the
    sponsor) nor in her oral submissions where arguments  on  the  Act  are
    being put.  Is it said that the rule is bad because it has  the  effect
    of discriminating against disabled  people:  so,  presumably  the  rule
    should not be applied to anybody.  Or is it, alternatively, being  said
    that the rule is bad in its discriminatory effect only  and  that  non-
    disabled people should be bound by it but disabled people should not be
    bound by it?  Or, finally, is it said that the rule is only bad in  the
    circumstances of the case and that in the  present  case  the  decision
    should have been made without regard  to  it?   As  we  understand  the
    matter, different considerations might arise in  relation  to  each  of
    these arguments.   All of them, however,  suggest  that,  in  order  to
    avoid discrimination in  relation  to  the  sponsor's  disability,  the
    appellant was entitled to have a decision in her favour contrary to the
    Immigration Rules.

24. That is a difficult argument to make, for the  following  reason.   The
    Immigration Rules are made under s 3(2) of the  Immigration  Act  1971,
    which requires the Secretary of State to make such rules and  lay  them
    before Parliament, where they are subject to  the  negative  resolution
    procedure.  As we have said, the Disability Discrimination Act  (which,
    for these purposes, means Disability Discrimination Act 1995 as amended
    by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005) prohibits discrimination  by
    "public authorities" as defined.  The principal  provision  upon  which
    the appellant relies is s 21B(1) which provides that:

        "It is unlawful for a public authority to  discriminate  against  a
        disabled person in carrying out its functions".

25. There are, however, a number  of  exceptions.   "Public  authority"  is
    defined in ss 21B(2) and (3) for the principal  substantive  provisions
    of the Act as excluding "either House of Parliament".  In s 21C we find
    the following:

        "(2) Section 21B(1) does not apply to any act of, or  relating  to,
             making,  confirming or approving -
               a) an Act, an Act of the Scottish Parliament or an Order  in
                  Council; or
               b) an instrument made under an Act, or under an Act  of  the
                  Scottish Parliament, by -
                  i) a Minister of the Crown;
            ...".

26. Those provisions ensure that legislation cannot itself be  attacked  as
    discriminatory: that is to say, the rights given to disabled people  by
    the Act are subject to any specific provisions in legislation.  The Act
    gives no dispensation from duties imposed by legislation, and gives  no
    right or obligation to "read down"  legislation  in  order  to  prevent
    discrimination.  Thus, a person may be obliged by legislation which  is
    discriminatory;  and  neither  the  maker  of  the  decision  nor   the
    legislation under which he was acting can be the subject of questioning
    under the Disability Discrimination Act.

27. The Immigration Rules are in mandatory terms.  The sponsor's problem is
    that it is said that he cannot meet those terms.   Even  if  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer is subject to the Disability Discrimination  Act,  he
    is bound to apply the Immigration Rules; and  those  rules  themselves,
    whether regarded as made by "either House  of  Parliament"  or  whether
    regarded as "an instrument made under  an  Act"  by  the  Secretary  of
    State, are immune from the provisions of the Disability  Discrimination
    Act.  It follows that almost any argument based on  the  discriminatory
    nature of the Rules themselves is unlikely to be successful  if  framed
    within the terms of the Disability Discrimination Act.  In the  absence
    of more focused arguments we can take it no further than that.

28. Before looking at Article 14, we should note a number  of  features  of
    the evidence in the present case and the way in which it has been  put.
    We have already observed that evidence of third party support was  both
    entirely lacking at the date of the decision and in  any  event  wholly
    inadequate.  Yet it is clear that the appellant's argument is based  on
    a suggestion that in her case she should be allowed to  rely  on  third
    party support.  It appears to us that even if that argument were to  be
    successful in principle, on the facts and evidence  in  this  case  she
    would not be successful.  Secondly, it is suggested that the  appellant
    has to be maintained by the sponsor.  We do not know exactly where that
    came from, although a suggestion of it does  feature  in  the  original
    notice of refusal and in the respondent's review.  The  position  under
    the Rules is that the parties have to maintain themselves, not that one
    of them has to maintain both of them.  Thirdly, it  is  very  far  from
    clear why any assumption is made  that  the  appellant  cannot  herself
    work.  Miss Rutherford argued that she  was  in  a  worse  position  in
    obtaining work than she would be if her husband was not  disabled.   We
    do not understand why that is said.  Nor do we understand it to be said
    on her behalf that she would generally  find  it  difficult  to  obtain
    work: on the contrary, her case as put to  the  Immigration  Judge  was
    that she had a  job  available  to  her.    It  is  also  important  to
    appreciate that the financial contribution from the appellant, required
    by the  Immigration  Rules,  is  the  marginal  cost  of  bringing  the
    household income up to the level of adequacy.  That may well be  not  a
    very great sum, and there is no reason  at  all  to  suppose  that  the
    appellant is unable to earn it.  Lastly, but by no means least, we must
    refer to the sponsor's own position.  As we have indicated, the grounds
    assert that he cannot work and that he is unlikely to ever be  able  to
    work.  We do not know on what evidence that assertion is based.  It  is
    true that he currently receives benefits, which may be  assumed  to  be
    paid in recognition of a present inability to work,  although,  as  the
    Immigration Judge pointed out, he appears  to  be  able  to  take  long
    foreign holidays.  So far as prognosis is concerned, however, the  only
    medical evidence appears to be a doctor's  letter  dated  18  September
    2006 and prepared in connection  with  the  application  to  the  Entry
    Clearance Officer Damascus.  Certainly, Miss Rutherford was  unable  to
    point to any more recent or specific evidence.  It reads, in  full,  as
    follows:

        "[The sponsor] is depressed and needs support.  His condition would
        be greatly improved if his wife were allowed into  the  country  to
        join him."

      If that is the evidence on which it was based, it was quite wrong  for
    counsel before the Immigration Judge and counsel before us to make  the
    assertions about prognosis that they did.

29. For those reasons it seems to us that the general  arguments  based  on
    discrimination, whether framed under the Disability Discrimination  Act
    or by reference to Article 14, are bound to  fail  on  the  facts.   In
    addition, however, there is the point made by  the  Immigration  Judge.
    All that is being required is that the appellant, who proposes to  come
    to the United Kingdom, show that the marginal cost of her  upkeep  will
    be met.  That is the position she would be in if her  husband  was  not
    disabled, but was on income support; it is also the position she  would
    be in if her husband had a low-paid job which was only adequate for his
    own maintenance; it would also be the case if her  husband  had  family
    responsibilities preventing him from taking employment.  The suggestion
    made by Miss Rutherford that the appellant's position is different  and
    more  difficult  because  of  her  husband's  disability  is   entirely
    undemonstrated.  It follows that no question of discrimination in  fact
    arises.  If it did arise, the remedy proposed is to allow the appellant
    to rely on third party support, but, as we have  pointed  out,  if  her
    case depended on third party support it could not succeed.

30. Both before  the  Immigration  Judge  and  before  us  complicated  and
    difficult arguments have been put, inadequately reasoned,  and  without
    proper regard to the evidence upon which they had to be based.  For the
    reasons we have given we consider that the Immigration Judge was  amply
    justified in dismissing the appeal and did not err in law in doing  so.
    We order that her determination shall stand.
