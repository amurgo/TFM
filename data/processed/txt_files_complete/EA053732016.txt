                       (anonymity direction NOT MADE)
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr T Melvin, Home Office Presenting Officer.
For the Respondent:    No appearance.


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. The Appellant in this case is the  Secretary  of  State  for  the  Home
    Department. However, for the sake of clarity, I shall use the titles by
    which the parties were know before the  First-tier  Tribunal  with  the
    Secretary of State referred to as "the Respondent"  and  Mr  Cornel  as
    "the Appellant".

 2. The Appellant is a citizen of Romania who appealed against the decision
    of the Respondent to refuse him admission to  the  United  Kingdom  and
    revoke his Family Permit in accordance with Regulation 1, 19(2) and  21
    of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations  2006.  It  was
    said that this was justified at grounds of public policy based upon the
    Appellant's criminal convictions.

 3. Following the hearing, and in a decision promulgated on 23  June  2017,
    Judge of the  First-tier  Tribunal  Rothwell  allowed  the  Appellant's
    appeal.

 4. The Respondent sought permission to appeal. It was granted by Judge  of
    the First-tier Tribunal Hollingworth on 8 March 2018. His  reasons  for
    so granting were: -

         "1.  It is arguable that the Judge  had  set  out  an  insufficient
         analysis in relation to the conduct of the Appellant illustrated by
         his convictions in relation to risk of repetition. It  is  arguable
         that greater weight should have been attached to the failure of the
         Appellant to surrender to custody and to the  repeat  offending  in
         the context of theft/shoplifting in relation to risk of repetition.
         It is arguable that greater weight should  have  been  attached  to
         repeat  offending  set  against  the  backcloth  of  the  range  of
         offending. It is arguable that the  Judge  has  attached  too  much
         significance to the finding  that  these  were  low-level  offences
         dealt with  by  fines.  It  is  arguable  that  the  absence  of  a
         sufficient analysis in this overall context vitiates the conclusion
         that the personal conduct of the  Appellant  did  not  represent  a
         genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting  one  of
         the fundamental interests of  society.  It  is  arguable  that  the
         Judge's conclusion that this criterion was  not  satisfied  on  the
         footing that the offences were punished  by  fines  only  distracts
         from the width of  the  foundations  necessary  for  reaching  that
         conclusion".

 5. Thus, the appeal came before me today.

 6. Neither the Appellant nor his representatives appeared at the  hearing.
    I had before me a letter from the Appellant's representatives dated  25
    April 2018. It states:

         "We enclosed (sic) herewith a skeleton argument to  be  relied  for
         the hearing listed on 27 April 2018  before  an  Immigration  Judge
         sitting at Field House.

         Please note that our instructions are to make  a  paper  submission
         therefore, we will not be appearing at the  hearing  to  make  oral
         submission. The Immigration  Judge  is  respectfully  requested  to
         accept our submission on papers before making a  decision  in  this
         matter".

    Attached to that letter are two skeleton arguments. The  first  appears
    to be that which was filed in the original proceedings before the First-
    tier Tribunal. The second is dated 25 April 2018.  It  states,  amongst
    other things, that the Judge has "given proper and  detailed  reasoning
    as to how and why  derived  sic)  at  the  conclusion  she  did".   The
    offences committed by the Appellant were in essence "spent convictions"
    and the Appellant provided evidence as to his circumstances as  to  why
    he committed the  minor  offences  which  the  Judge  was  "correct  to
    accept". The Judge was also correct to conclude that the Appellant does
    not represent a genuine and sufficiently serious threat  affecting  one
    of the fundamental interests of society. There is  within  the  Judge's
    decision no material error and that the issue of �5,000 cash  found  in
    the Appellant's possession at the time of his  arrest  for  shoplifting
    was not within the evidence of this appeal.

 7.  Mr  Melvin  relied  on  the  grounds  seeking  permission  to   appeal
    emphasising that the Appellant has been convicted of five  offences  in
    the United Kingdom between 2010 and 2015 and that following an  attempt
    to enter the United Kingdom on 16 May  2016  the  Appellant  maintained
    that he was a professional poker player and was returning to the United
    Kingdom to play in a  game  in  Nottingham.  He  had  no  knowledge  of
    deposits of over �40,000 in a  three-month  period  paid  into  a  bank
    account. He submitted the Judge had materially erred in concluding that
    the Appellant's convictions in themselves did not justify the  decision
    and that it was incumbent upon her to determine whether  the  Appellant
    was likely to commit further offences  in  this  country.  This  is  an
    Appellant with a clear propensity to reoffend. No evidence was provided
    to suggest otherwise. The Judge has  not  engaged  with  this  material
    issue. Beyond that it is unclear on what basis the Judge  accepted  the
    witness evidence in relation to the Appellant possessing a small  swiss
    army knife and the Appellant's explanation for  failing  to  surrender.
    The Judge has failed to provide an adequate assessment of the evidence.
    He invited me to either remake the decision today dismissing the appeal
    or in the alternative remit it to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh
    hearing.

 8. I accept the submission that there is here a material error of law. The
    Judge has not adequately reasoned her decision and  has  insufficiently
    analysed the Appellant's conduct as shown by his  convictions  and  the
    risk he poses of repeat offending.  Further  the  Judge's  analysis  at
    paragraph 31 of her decision,  relating  to  the  Appellant's  criminal
    offending, is flawed in that the absence of sufficient analysis in  the
    overall context  of  this  appeal  vitiates  the  conclusion  that  the
    Appellant's personal conduct did not represent a genuine,  present  and
    sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental  interests
    of society.

 9. I conclude that a material error has been made.  In  the  circumstances
    further evidence may well be called for and accordingly the appeal will
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal.

Decision

The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal  involved  the  making
of an error on a point of law. The decision is  set  aside.  The  appeal  is
remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be  dealt  with  afresh  pursuant  to
Section 12(2)(b)(i) of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement  Act  2007  and
Practice Direction 7(b) before any Judge aside from Judge Rothwell.

No anonymity direction is made.


Signed                              Date 3 May 2018.
