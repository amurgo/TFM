For the Appellant:     Mr A McVeety (Senior HOPO)
For the Respondents:   Mr Salam (Solicitor)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. This is an appeal against the decision  of  First-tier  Tribunal  Judge
    Herwald, promulgated on 6th  February  2018,  following  a  hearing  in
    Manchester on 19th January 2018.  In the decision, the judge  dismissed
    the appeal of the Sponsor, Mr [B], but allowed the appeals of [AU2] and
    [AU1].  The Respondent,  Secretary  of  State,  applied  for,  and  was
    granted, permission to appeal to  the  Upper  Tribunal,  and  thus  the
    matter comes before me.  For convenience I will refer to the parties as
    they were referred to in the First-tier Tribunal.

The Appellants

 2. The lead Appellant in this appeal, Mohammad [B], is a German  national.
    He was born on 15th December 1955.  The remaining  two  Appellants  are
    citizens of Pakistan.  [AU1] was  born  on  1st  April  2014,  and  her
    brother, [AU2], was born on August 2012.

The Appellants' Claim

 3. The essence of the second and third Appellants'  claim  was  that  they
    sought the right to reside in the UK on the  basis  of  the  fact  that
    their grandfather, Mohammad [B], was a German national, and  that  they
    were his granddaughter and grandson respectively.  They were his direct
    descendants.  It is important to note, however, that  the  applications
    by the two children were made not on the same basis.   The  application
    by the granddaughter, [AU1],  was  made  for  a  residence  card.   The
    application for [AU2], was made on the basis of a request for permanent
    residence.

The Judge's Findings

 4. At the hearing before Judge Herwald, it transpired that,  although  the
    Sponsor had not in the past been able to demonstrate, (given the gap in
    his unemployment), that he had  been  a  qualified  person,  exercising
    treaty rights for the required duration of his time in the UK, the fact
    was that at the time of the hearing, there had been  evidence  that  he
    had been working for  a  company  called  Aliyzah  Ltd,  from  whom  he
    received a salary.  There was no contract of employment.  However,  the
    Sponsor received payslips and he had a P60 certificate (see page 59  of
    the bundle).  His period  of  employment  shows  him  earning  �40  and
    �286.45 (see paragraph 16(d)).  Therefore, Judge Herwald was satisfied,
    on the basis of the P60s and the wage slips, that the  first  Appellant
    was working at least in March 2017, in employment  that  would  not  be
    described as "marginal" work.  He was genuinely  employed.   Therefore,
    the benefit of his employment could be extended to his grandchildren as
    direct descendants (paragraph 16(h)).

 5. On this basis, the judge went on to express himself in terms therefore,
    "I dismiss the appeal in relation to the Sponsor Mr [B],  and  I  allow
    the appeals by [AU2] and [AU1]" (see Notice of Decisions).

 6. At the hearing before me on  21st  August  2018,  there  was  agreement
    between Mr McVeety, for the Respondent Secretary of State and Mr Salam,
    appearing on behalf of the Appellants, that  the  judge  had  erred  in
    expressing himself in the way that he had.  Presently the position  was
    that, because [AU1], had applied for a residence card,  this  had  been
    granted.  However, the application  of  [AU2],  had  not  been  granted
    because he had applied for a permanent residence card.  What  he  ought
    to have done, and what he qualified for,  was  a  five  year  residence
    permit. The judge, had created an ambiguity as to what it was that  the
    appeals were being allowed in respect of when he had expressed himself,
    by stating that, "I allow the appeals by [AU2]  and  [AU1]."  Mr  Salam
    agreed, that I should make a finding of an error of law, and record the
    fact that the application was for a five year residency.

Error of Law

 7. Given the consensus between the parties before  me,  I  find  that  the
    decision of the judge will have involved the making of an  error  on  a
    point of law (see Section 12(1) of TCEA 2007) such that it falls to  be
    set aside. As Mr McVeety pointed out,  to  all  intents  and  purposes,
    there is only one appeal before this Tribunal, namely, that  of  [AU2].
    As far as his sister, [AU1], is  concerned,  she  has  been  granted  a
    'residence card' because  this  is  all  she  was  applying  for.   The
    Appellant, [AU2], whose appeal was the  only  effective  appeal  before
    this Tribunal, should not have had his appeal allowed  outright.   That
    being so, I make a finding of an error of law, and  express  the  hope,
    that the appropriate decision to be made  by  the  Secretary  of  State
    hereafter is for a grant of a residence permit, on the same  basis,  as
    has been granted to [AU1], for a five year period.  He is not  entitled
    to permanent residence as of yet.

Remaking the Decision

 8. I remake the decision on the basis of  the  findings  of  the  original
    judge, the evidence before him, and the submissions that I  have  heard
    today.  I am allowing the appeal by the  Secretary  of  State  for  the
    reasons that I have given above.  The first Appellant is entitled to  a
    grant  of  a  residence  permit  for  five-years,  should  he  make  an
    application on  that  basis,  but  he  is  not  entitled  to  permanent
    residency.

 9. There has been a delay in sending out this Determination to the parties
    concerned, because although it was dictated on the day of the Hearing,
    and typed up shortly thereafter, it appears to have been held up in the
    system, before promulgation.

Notice of Decision

10. For the foregoing reasons, my decision is as follows:

11. The making of the previous decision in relation to the second and third
    appellants involved the making of an error on a point of law.

12. I do not set aside the previous decision  in  relation  to  the  second
    appellant, as the Secretary of State has granted her a residence card.

13. I set aside the previous decision in relation to the third appellant.

14. I remake the  decision  by  dismissing  the  third  appellant's  appeal
    against the respondent's decision to refuse him a  permanent  right  of
    residence.

15. No anonymity direction is made.
