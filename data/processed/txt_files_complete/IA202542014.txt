                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS

    1.   This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal by the Secretary of State,
         with permission, against a determination of the First-tier Tribunal
         (Judge Cruthers) who in a determination promulgated on 26th  August
         2014 allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal  against  the  Secretary  of
         State's decision to refuse him leave to  remain  in  the  UK  as  a
         student.
    2.    For  the  sake  of  continuity  and  clarity  I  will,  in   this
         determination, continue to refer to Mr Aurangzeb as  the  Appellant
         and to the Secretary of State as the Respondent.


    3.   The Appellant in this case came to the United Kingdom as a student
         in  January  2011.  By  June  2012  he  had  completed  a  National
         Certificate in Manufacturing Engineering and then gained a place at
         Quinton College in Birmingham to study a Level 5  Extended  Diploma
         in Business and Administrative Management.  He was granted  further
         leave to remain as a student to  follow  that  course  until  March
         2014. He paid the fees and commenced study. However, in April  2013
         The Home Office informed the Appellant  that  it  had  revoked  the
         college's licence and consequently varied his leave  such  that  it
         would expire in June 2013. By that  time  the  Appellant  had  been
         studying at Quinton College from October 2012 until March 2013  and
         was unable to obtain a refund of the fees he had paid.


    4.   Within the time allowed the Appellant managed to obtain a place at
         Bradford Regional College to study a Level 5 Diploma in  Management
         and Leadership. He paid the full fee of ï¿½3,500 to  the  college  in
         order to start immediately. The Appellant then made an  application
         for further leave to remain to study that course which was  to  run
         until December 2014.


    5.   Initially the Secretary of State refused the  application  on  the
         basis that the CAS relied upon had been withdrawn. The  Appellant's
         appeal against the refusal  was  allowed  on  the  basis  that  the
         Secretary of State had  checked  the  wrong  CAS  (Quinton  College
         instead of BRC).  Judge  Ransley  allowed  the  Appellant's  appeal
         against that decision to the limited extent that she remitted it to
         the Secretary of State for her to reconsider. The  Respondent  then
         issued  another  refusal  on  the  basis  that  the  Appellant  had
         insufficient funds.


    6.   The appeal before the First-tier Tribunal was argued on the  basis
         that the Secretary of State should have treated  the  applicant  as
         having an established presence in this country, which required  him
         to show a lower level of funds than otherwise.


    7.   Judge Cruthers found against the  Appellant  on  that  basis.  The
         Appellant would have had to show that he had been studying for  six
         months at Quintin College when in fact he had  been  studying  only
         five months and two weeks. However, the Judge went on  to  consider
         the Appellant's claim under Article 8. He noted that when he  heard
         the appeal, on 26th August 2014, the Appellant's  course  had  only
         four months to run, until December 2014.  He  considered  that  the
         difficulties encountered by the Appellant were no fault of his.  He
         had been part -way through his studies when the licence was revoked
         by the Secretary of State. He lost the fees that  he  had  paid  to
         that college. Furthermore, the judge noted that  the  Secretary  of
         State's initial refusal  was  made  on  a  wholly  erroneous  basis
         because the caseworker had checked the wrong  CAS.   Since  he  was
         first offered a place at the new  College  he  had  been  regularly
         attending classes and submitting assignments  and  the  Judge  also
         found that, having completed his initial course, he is not  one  of
         those student appellants who has achieved nothing  constructive  in
         the UK.  He concluded that the refusal  which  had  the  effect  of
         requiring him to return to his  country  prior  to  completing  his
         course was disproportionate and he allowed the appeal.


    8.   The Secretary of State  sought  permission  to  appeal  which  was
         granted on the basis that  the  judge  had  failed  to  follow  the
         guidance of Gulshan (Article 8 -  new  Rules  -  correct  approach)
         [2013] UKUT 00640 (IAC)  and explain why he had strayed beyond  the
         Rules and considered Article 8 under the ECHR.  Also he had  failed
         to consider paragraph 276ADE at all.


    9.   The grounds I find to be  wholly  without  merit.  This  case  was
         clearly one that cried out to be allowed on the basis of  CDS  (PBS
         "available" Article 8) Brazil [2010] UKUT 305 (IAC). The  Appellant
         was entirely innocent of the matters which had led to him being  in
         the position he found himself. He has done everything asked of him.
         Even if  the  Judge  had,  as  the  Secretary  of  State  suggests,
         considered the application of paragraph 276 ADE of the Rules, which
         the Appellant could not meet and then gone on to  consider  Article
         8, the end result would have been the same in that the Judge  would
         have allowed the appeal for the very reason that he did.  Therefore
         even if it is an error of law  not  to  consider  paragraph  276ADE
         first, it would have made no difference  to  the  outcome  for  the
         reasons given by the Judge.


    10.  It is somewhat surprising that the Secretary of State  has  chosen
         to seek permission to appeal in this case. The appeal being allowed
         on Article 8 grounds, it is entirely a matter for the Secretary  of
         State how long a period of leave she grants to  the  Appellant.  He
         only wished to complete his course of studies which are due  to  be
         completed in December 2014. Having  dismissed  the  appeal  to  the
         Upper Tribunal for the reasons that I have given above, it is now a
         matter for the Secretary of State to consider the duration of leave
         to be granted.


    11.  The appeal to the Upper Tribunal is dismissed.
