                                                                    Claimant


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr E Tufan ( Home Office Presenting Officer)
For the Respondent:    Mr F Habtemariam (Legal representative)


                            DECISION AND REASONS

 1. For ease of reference I shall refer to the parties as the "Secretary of
    State" who is the Appellant in these proceedings and to the  Respondent
    as the "Claimant". This is the Secretary of State's  appeal  against  a
    decision by the First-tier Tribunal (Judge S Taylor)  who  allowed  the
    Claimant's appeal for confirmation of  a  right  of  residence  as  the
    family member of an EEA citizen exercising Treaty  Rights  in  the  UK,
    pursuant to Regulation 15  Immigration  (EEA)  Regulations  2006  ("EEA
    Regs").  The decision was promulgated on 5th November 2014.

   2. The definition of a "qualified person" is found in reg 6. In terms of
      reg 6(1) a "qualified person" means a person who is an EEA national
      and in the United Kingdom as -


         (a) a job seeker;
         (b) a worker;
         (c) a self-employed person;
         (d) a self-sufficient person; or
         (e) a student.


    Regulation 6(2) sets out circumstances in which a person who is no
    longer working does not cease to be treated as a worker for the purpose
    of reg 6(1)(b). These circumstances include, at reg 6(2)(a), that the
    person "is temporarily unable to work as the result of an illness or
    accident".


    Regulation 15(1)(c) refers to a permanent right of residence being
    acquired by a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity.
    This term is defined in reg 5, which includes at reg 5(3) the following
    definition of a worker or self-employed person who has ceased activity:


         "(3) A person satisfies the conditions in this paragraph if -
             (a) he terminates his activities in the United Kingdom as a
             worker or self-employed person as a result of permanent
             incapacity to work; and
             (b) either -
                  (i) he resided in the United Kingdom continuously for more
                  than two years prior to the termination; or
                  (ii) the incapacity is the result of an accident at work
                  or an occupational disease that entitles him to a pension
                  payable in full or in part by an institution in the United
                  Kingdom."

    Background

 3. The Claimant is a citizen of Nigeria and  his  date  of  birth  is  1st
    December 1974.  He is married to an EEA Polish wife and they have three
    children aged 5, 3 and a young baby. She has  a  history  of  suffering
    from a medical condition whereby there is a risk of  miscarriage  at  a
    late stage of pregnancy. She was also diagnosed with  a  serious  liver
    disease. The Sponsor worked for two years in the UK  until  she  became
    pregnant with their second child, a son born on  5th  June  2010.   She
    went on maternity leave in March 2010 to which she was  entitled  until
    March 2011. Thereafter she remained out of work because of illness, and
    claimed Jobseekers allowance from October 2011 until April  2012.   She
    then became pregnant again and gave birth to their third child  on  5th
    January 2014.  This was followed by a period of further illness.  There
    was evidence of the sponsor having attended two job interviews in 2012.
    There was evidence of a letter dated 8th October 2014 to show  she  was
    registered at the job centre.

 4. In a reasons for refusal letter it was accepted that the Sponsor was an
    EEA citizen and that she was a worker from 2008 - 2010.  Reference  was
    made to Regulation 6(2) EEA  Regs.  which  defines  persons  no  longer
    working but who retain the status  of  a  worker,  which  includes  job
    seekers and persons temporarily incapacitated. It was not accepted that
    she was a qualified person as either a worker or a job seeker.  It  was
    not accepted that the sponsor was seeking  work  whilst  also  claiming
    that she was temporarily incapacitated from illness.

 5. The Secretary of State sought evidence of  qualification  as  a  worker
    from March 2010 and from October 2011. The refusal letter  acknowledged
    that a claim for Jobseeker allowance  was  made  in  October  2011  and
    expected evidence of being a job seeker since that date. The  Secretary
    of State did not accept the letter of interview as evidence of actively
    seeking work, under the Regulations relevant to jobseekers.

 6. At the hearing before the First-tier Tribunal neither the Claimant  nor
    the Secretary of State were represented.  The  Claimant  and  his  wife
    attended in person. The Tribunal found that the  Claimants'  wife  (the
    sponsor) was a qualified person as a worker having retained that status
    either as a person who was unable to  work  as  she  was  incapacitated
    under Regulation 5(3)  Immigration  EEA  Regulations  2006  or  in  the
    alternative she was a job seeker.   The  Tribunal  concluded  that  the
    sponsor was living in the UK for a continuous period of 5  years  as  a
    qualified person.  The Tribunal found that  the  sponsor  was  employed
    from 2008 - 2010. It further found that,  "It  was  then  accepted,  on
    further evidence that the sponsor could be treated as  a  worker  until
    October 2011."[12] It found that she was exercising Treaty rights  from
    May 2008 until October 2011 and there after  was  a  job  seeker  until
    April 2012.  The Tribunal found that there  was  a  further  period  of
    illness, a miscarriage and birth of a child in January 2014,  and  that
    the sponsor was registered for work in late 2014. The Tribunal found no
    inconsistency in the claim that the sponsor was incapacitated by reason
    of ill heath and yet she was available for work, albeit not  all  forms
    of employment.

    Grounds

 7. The Secretary of State argued that the  Tribunal  erred  by  concluding
    that the Claimant met  Regulation  5(3)  EEA  Regs.  as  there  was  no
    evidence that the Claimant was permanently incapacitated.   Further  it
    was unclear how the Tribunal calculated its alternative conclusion that
    the Sponsor was a worker/jobseeker between 2010 -2014. The Tribunal did
    not engage with whether or not the sponsor  had  a  genuine  chance  of
    being engaged for work.

    Permission to appeal

 8. First-tier Tribunal Judge Saffer granted permission  for  the  "reasons
    identified in the grounds of appeal".




    Error of law hearing

 9. Mr Tufan expanded on the  grounds  and  submitted  that  there  was  no
    finding of permanent incapacity as required in Regulation 5(3).   There
    were inadequate reasons  for finding that the sponsor  had  established
    status as a qualified person from 2010-2014[12]. The  evidence  of  the
    two letters of interview were inadequate to meet  the  requirements  in
    Regulation 6.

10. Mr Habtemariam responded that the  Tribunal  found  evidence  that  the
    Sponsor had covered the period from May 2008 - October  2011  when  she
    was a worker and on maternity leave. In the alternative  there  was  no
    challenge to the finding that the sponsor was a job seeker from October
    2011 until April 2012. Further  the  Tribunal's  finding  that  it  was
    possible to be incapacitated for some but not all types of work  was  a
    finding that was open to it to make.

    Discussion and decision

11. It was common ground  that  the  parties  were  married  and  that  the
    Claimant was granted a residence card in May 2008 and that he had  been
    employed in the UK throughout.  The  issue  was  whether  the  Claimant
    could show that his wife  was  a  qualified  person  exercising  Treaty
    Rights for a continuous period of 5 years from May 2008.  The  Tribunal
    found, and it was not challenged in the grounds, that  four  years  had
    been established by the sponsor, as a worker and/or  a  jobseeker.  The
    material facts were that she was employed from May 2008  and  in  March
    2010 she went on maternity leave to which she was entitled until  March
    2011. Their son was born  on  5th  June  2010.  She  was  then  awarded
    Jobseekers allowance from October 2011 until  April  2012.  She  became
    pregnant again in  April  2012  and  was  unable  to  work  because  of
    pregnancy and illness. There followed a further  claim  for  jobseekers
    allowance and the sponsor produced two letters of interview  for  jobs.
    She had another child  in  January  2014  and  thereafter  claimed  job
    seekers allowance. The  Claimant  adduced  medical  evidence  that  the
    sponsor  suffered  medical  difficulties  leading  to  risk   of   late
    miscarriage and that she also suffered from Hepatitis B, which was  not
    challenged before the Tribunal. At the hearing before me  the  Claimant
    produced a letter offering the sponsor a job.

12. At the error of law hearing  before  me  both  representatives  focused
    their submissions on the issue raised in the grounds with reference  to
    Regulation 5(3), it being  argued  that  that  the  Tribunal  erred  in
    failing to make a finding as to "permanent" incapacity.  Having further
    considered the material and with particular reference  to  the  reasons
    for refusal  letter dated 22 January 2014, it is clear to me  that  the
    Secretary of State considered  and  applied  Regulation  6(2)  and  not
    Regulation 5(3).  Accordingly I am satisfied that arguments pursued  at
    the initial hearing were based on a misunderstanding of an error on the
    part of the Tribunal  in  referring  to  Regulation  5(3)  rather  than
    Regulation 6(2). That does not mean that there was no  error  but  that
    the grounds followed on from the  Tribunal's  reference  to  the  wrong
    Regulation. As such the  grounds  pursued  are  not  made  out  as  the
    relevant  Regulation required no consideration of permanent incapacity

13. Regulation 5(3) requires that the  incapacity  to  work  is  permanent.
    There was no evidence before  the  Tribunal  that  the  incapacity  was
    permanent and indeed no finding was made  to  that  effect.  Regulation
    6(2) is worded in terms of.. " he is temporarily unable to  work  as  a
    result of illness  or  accident".  This  is  the  regulation  that  was
    considered in the refusal letter. As a consequence I  find  that  there
    was an error of law  by  the  Tribunal  in  deciding  the  appeal  with
    reference to the wrong regulation.  I now consider if that error was  a
    material error of law.

14. The Tribunal found that the  sponsor  was  incapacitated  for  work  by
    reason  of  illness  associated  with  liver  disease  and   pregnancy.
    Regulation 6 provides no period of time for a  person  to  have  ceased
    activity on a temporary basis. Whilst the  Tribunal  acknowledged  that
    the sponsor's GP was not asked  if  the  incapacity  was  permanent  or
    temporary, it nonetheless found that she was incapacitated  since  2010
    because of liver condition and her pregnancy related  condition.  I  am
    satisfied that this was a finding that the  Tribunal  was  entitled  to
    make on the objective evidence and also having  regard  to  the  actual
    state of affairs which existed.

15. I find no inconsistency in the finding made by the  Tribunal   that  on
    the one hand the sponsor was incapacitated for work and  on  the  other
    was available and seeking work and in receipt of Jobseekers  allowance.
    The Tribunal acknowledged that the sponsor's condition  was  such  that
    she would not be able to do all forms  of  employment  because  of  her
    illnesses but that she was a jobseeker who had been awarded Job seekers
    allowance. She was seeking work of a type that she was able to do given
    the restrictions imposed  by  her  health  difficulties.  The  Tribunal
    decided that the reality of her situation objectively was that she  was
    incapacitated from work. [12] In my view it  needed  to  have  gone  no
    further given its findings amounted to an acceptance  that  that  there
    was a realistic prospect of the sponsor being able to  return  to  some
    form of work and remain engaged with the labour market.

16. As to the alternative position adopted by the Tribunal,  I  am  equally
    satisfied that the finding that she was a job seeker  during  the  year
    2011-2012 and thereafter, was sustainable.  Clearly she was in  receipt
    of jobseekers allowance in excess of the 6 month  limitation,  but  the
    Tribunal found that she was actively seeking work  (Regulation  6(2)(b)
    with reference to Condition B) and had a genuine chance of  employment,
    as evidenced by the two letters of interview. The Secretary  of  States
    objection to this amounts simply to a disagreement  with  that  finding
    and has no merit as a ground of appeal.

17.  Overall I am satisfied that the approach adopted by the  Tribunal  was
    entirely in keeping with a purposive  interpretation  of  Regulation  6
    which is intended to reflect the UK's obligations to be performed under
    the Workers Residence Directive 2004 with reference to Articles 16  and
    17, and as decided in FMB (EEA Reg.6(2)(a) temporarily unable to  work)
    Uganda [2012] UKUT 447 IAC. Further it  is  compatible  with  the  anti
    discriminatory approach in EEA law, where a woman is deemed temporarily
    unable to work because of the late stages of pregnancy she retains  the
    status of a worker until such time as it was reasonable  to  return  to
    work.  Although there was an error of law by  reference  to  Regulation
    5(3), it was not material as the findings of the Tribunal are such that
    Regulation 6(2) is met.

Notice of Decision

I find no material error of law in the determination.   The  decision  shall
stand save that I substitute the decision made  allowing  the  appeal  under
Regulation 6(2)(a) of the Immigration EEA Regulations 2006.

No anonymity direction is made.
