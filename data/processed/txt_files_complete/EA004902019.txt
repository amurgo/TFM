                                AMIR HUSSAIN
                                                                  Respondent


                            DECISION AND REASONS

1.   For the sake of continuity, I shall refer to the parties as  they  were
    before the First-tier Tribunal although technically  the  Secretary  of
    State is the appellant in the appeal before the Upper Tribunal.

2.   The original appellant (Mr Hussain) appealed the respondent's  decision
    dated 16 January 2019 to refuse to issue a residence card recognising a
    retained right of residence as a family member under European law.

3.   The decision was  made  with  reference  to  regulation  10(5)  of  the
    Immigration  (European  Economic  Area)  Regulations  2016  ("the   EEA
    Regulations 2016"). The appeal was brought under regulation 36  of  the
    same regulations on the sole ground of whether  the  decision  breached
    the appellant's rights under the EU Treaties in respect of  entry  into
    or residence in the United Kingdom  (Schedule  2(2)(4)).  There  is  no
    evidence to suggest that the appellant was issued with a  notice  under
    section 120 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act  2002  ("the
    NIAA 2002") or that  the  Secretary  of  State  made  a  'human  rights
    decision' that might give rise to  a  right  of  appeal  under  section
    82(1)(b) NIAA 2002.

4.   First-tier Tribunal Judge K.R. Moore ("the judge") allowed  the  appeal
    in a decision promulgated on 02 January 2020.

5.   The Secretary of State appealed the decision on the following grounds:

      i) The judge erred in appearing to determine the appeal with reference
         to human rights grounds, when he had no jurisdiction to do so under
         the EEA Regulations 2016: see  Munday  (EEA  decision:  grounds  of
         appeal) [2019] UKUT 00091;

     ii) The judge erred in appearing to consider a 'new matter' relating to
         Charter rights, which was raised for the first time at the hearing,
         without the Secretary of State's consent (section 85(5) NIAA 2002);
         and

    iii) The judge failed to give adequate reasons  and/or  failed  to  make
         clear the legal basis upon which he allowed the appeal.

6.   In view of the need to  take  precautions  following  the  outbreak  of
    Covid-19, the Upper Tribunal reviewed the case and sent  directions  to
    the parties on 29 May 2020. The Upper Tribunal encouraged  the  parties
    to discuss the case to see if there was any agreement as to whether the
    First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error on a point
    of law such that the decision needed to be set aside.  Having  reviewed
    the First-tier Tribunal decision and the arguments put forward  in  the
    grounds of appeal the Upper Tribunal  gave  the  following  preliminary
    indication.

         "In particular,  the  parties  may  wish  to  note  my  preliminary
         indication of the  merits  of  the  appeal  (without  prejudice  to
         further submissions). There is some force in the appellant's (SSHD)
         submission that the First-tier Tribunal judge may  have  failed  to
         distinguish between the jurisdiction to  determine  domestic  human
         rights issues (with reference to the Human  Rights  Act  1998)  and
         citizens' rights under European law. It is arguable that the  judge
         may have been misled by the appellant's muddled arguments  relating
         to Amirteymour v SSHD [2017] EWCA Civ 353, which  only  related  to
         the scope to argue  domestic  human  rights  issues  in  an  appeal
         brought under the EEA Regulations 2006. The decision in Munday (EEA
         decision: grounds of appeal) [2019] UKUT 00091  explained  why  the
         changes to the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the
         introduction  of   the   Immigration   (European   Economic   Area)
         Regulations 2016 altered the position. The  judge  seemed  to  make
         confused references to principles  of  domestic  and  European  law
         throughout the decision. He wrongly referred to  it  as  an  appeal
         brought under the 2002 Act  when  it  was  brought  under  the  EEA
         Regulations 2016 [1] and incorrectly referred to  "the  immigration
         rules" throughout. The judge  had  no  jurisdiction  to  allow  the
         appeal on the ground that it was "not in accordance with the law".

         It is possible that the judge failed to give  adequate  reasons  to
         explain how or why the appellant succeeded in relation to the  sole
         ground of appeal, which  was  whether  the  decision  breached  the
         appellant's rights under the EU Treaties in respect of  entry  into
         or residence in the United Kingdom.  Although  the  judge  did  not
         appear to conduct an assessment under  domestic  human  rights  law
         with reference to Article 8, and  was  likely  to  be  entitled  to
         consider rights issues relating to the Charter within  the  context
         of an appeal brought under the EEA Regulations 2016, it is arguable
         that the judge failed to  analyse  how  the  child's  rights  as  a
         European citizen  were  engaged  within  the  context  of  relevant
         European and domestic authorities such as Alfreso  Rend�n  Mar�n  v
         Administraci�n del Estado [2016] EUECJ C-165/14, Chavez  Vilchez  v
         Raadvanbestuur van der Sociale Verzekeringsbank & others [2018]  QB
         103 and Patel v SSHD [2019] UKSC 59 and how that  impacted  on  the
         appellant's rights, if any, under European law given that he is not
         a European citizen.

         The decision that was the subject of the appeal  did  not  consider
         human rights issues. At the  date  of  the  decision  the  evidence
         showed that the appellant did not have contact with  his  daughter.
         The Secretary of State had not previously been  asked  to  consider
         Charter rights and no arguments were put forward in the grounds  of
         appeal. It is also strongly  arguable  that  the  judge  failed  to
         consider whether the Charter rights issue raised by  the  appellant
         for the first time at the hearing was a 'new matter' that  required
         the Secretary of State's consent with reference to section 85(5) of
         the 2002 Act even if that meant adjourning the  case  to  seek  the
         Secretary  of  State's  written  opinion  in  the  absence   of   a
         representative. If the respondent does not accept that  the  First-
         tier Tribunal decision may have involved the making  of  errors  of
         law, then he should address these concerns in his written  argument
         (see paragraph 4(iv)).

7.   The parties complied with the direction to discuss  the  issues  raised
    in the appeal and were able to come to an agreement that the First-tier
    Tribunal decision involved the making of an error of law such  that  it
    needed to be set aside. Mr Hussain's representative sent  an  email  to
    the Upper Tribunal  on  03  June  2020  confirming  that  they  had  no
    objection to the decision being set aside and suggested that the appeal
    should be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for a  fresh  hearing.  A
    representative of the Secretary of State sent email  correspondence  on
    11 June 2020 confirming that the parties agreed that the appeal  should
    be remitted to the First-tier Tribunal for  a  fresh  hearing  with  no
    findings preserved.

Decision and reasons

8.   Although neither party identified the  basis  upon  which  they  agreed
    that the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of  an  error
    of law, it is reasonable to infer  that  both  parties  considered  the
    indication given by the Upper Tribunal in the  directions  and  agreed,
    for those reasons, that there was an error of  law  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal decision.

9.   For the reasons I gave in my preliminary indication,  I  conclude  that
    the First-tier Tribunal decision involved the making of an error  on  a
    point of law and must be set aside.

10.  I have considered the guidance given in paragraph 7.2 of  the  Practice
    Statement dated 25 September 2012. The normal course of action would be
    for the Upper Tribunal to remake  the  decision  even  if  it  involves
    further fact finding.

11.   At  the  hearing  before  the  First-tier  Tribunal  the   appellant's
    representative  accepted  that  the  appellant   did   not   meet   the
    requirements of regulation 10(6)  because  he  was  unable  to  produce
    evidence, at the time, to show that  he  was  a  worker,  self-employed
    person or self-sufficient person as if he were an EEA national  at  the
    date of the termination of the marriage on 28 December 2018.  It  seems
    that this was because he could not produce  relevant  evidence  at  the
    time. If the appellant has further evidence to show that he was  likely
    to be working at the relevant time, I  see  no  reason  why  the  issue
    should not remain open for determination. The Secretary  of  State  did
    not seek to  challenge  the  First-tier  Tribunal's  findings  of  fact
    relating to  the  family  court  proceedings  and  the  extent  of  the
    appellant's contact with his daughter, who is likely to be  an  Italian
    citizen. Given the terms of the family order  it  is  likely  that  the
    situation might have developed since  the  hearing  in  the  First-tier
    Tribunal. The appellant will need to provide  an  up  to  date  witness
    statement  outlining  the  extent  of  his  current  contact  with  his
    daughter.

12.  Although these issues could be determined by the Upper Tribunal,  I  am
    conscious of the fact that, despite the misleading  arguments  relating
    to human rights issues put forward by the appellant's representative in
    the First-tier Tribunal, other issues relating to Charter  rights  were
    raised that have not been considered by the Secretary of  State.  Given
    that the Secretary  of  State  was  also  absent  from  the  First-tier
    Tribunal hearing, it seems inappropriate for her to tackle the issue of
    Charter rights for the first time  in  the  Upper  Tribunal.  For  this
    reason, I find that it is appropriate to remit the appeal to the First-
    tier Tribunal for a fresh hearing.

13.  The question of whether the Secretary  of  State  consents  to  Charter
    rights issues being considered by the First-tier Tribunal will need  to
    be resolved before the next hearing. To this end I make  the  following
    directions:

      i) The appellant shall file on the First-tier Tribunal  and  serve  on
         the Secretary of State, written  submissions  relating  to  Charter
         rights with reference to relevant evidence and case law  within  28
         days of the date this decision is sent.

     ii) The respondent shall consider the appellant's  written  submissions
         and shall file and serve a response confirming  whether  she  gives
         consent for the First-tier Tribunal to consider the issue no  later
         than 14 days before the next hearing in the First-tier Tribunal.

14.  For the reasons given above I conclude  that  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    decision involved the making of  an  error  on  a  point  of  law.  The
    decision is set aside. The appeal will be remitted  to  the  First-tier
    Tribunal for a fresh hearing.



DECISION
