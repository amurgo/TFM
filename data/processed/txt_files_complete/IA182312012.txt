Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr A Kannangara, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Mr Lawrence Tarlow, Senior Home Office Presenting
Officer


                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


1.   This is an appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated 24  July
    2012 to refuse to the Appellant  the  issue  of  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right of residence under European  Community  Law  as
    the family member of an EEA national exercising treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom, the relevant Regulation being Regulation  8(2)  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  that  states  as
    follows:

         "8(1)    In these Regulations  'extended  family  member'  means  a
                person who is not a family member of an EEA  national  under
                regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who  satisfies  the
                conditions in paragraph (2), (3), (4) or (5).

           (2)    A person satisfies the condition in this paragraph if the
                person is a relative of an EEA national, his spouse  or  his
                civil partner and-

                (a)    the person is residing in an EEA State in which the
                    EEA national also resides and is dependent upon the EEA
                    national or is a member of his household;

                (b)    the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a)
                    and is accompanying the EEA national to the United
                    Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or

                (c)    the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a),
                    has joined the EEA national in the United Kingdom and
                    continues to be dependent upon him or to be a member of
                    his household."


2.   It will suffice to say that on 27 February 2013  I  presided  over  the
    error of law hearing referable to this appeal  and  I  concluded  in  a
    decision dated 9 April 2013 that the First-tier Judge had erred in law.
     In so doing I also recorded that it was agreed with the  parties  that
    those paragraphs in the First-tier Judge's determination recording  the
    Appellant and her witnesses' several statements and their oral evidence
    before the First-tier Judge as recorded by him, could be preserved,  as
    could paragraph 21 of his findings.  Paragraph 23  could  be  preserved
    but only to the  extent  that  the  First-tier  Judge  found  that  the
    Appellant was related to the  Sponsor's  wife  namely  as  her  sister.
    However, the rest of that paragraph was not to be preserved.  Paragraph
    22 was not to be preserved.

3.   Rather than repeat all that I set out in some detail in that  error  of
    law decision, I would refer to that decision which I have  attached  to
    this determination marked Appendix A.

4.   I have of course most carefully considered afresh the  Appellant's  and
    her witnesses' several statements and the record of the  oral  evidence
    that was  given  before  the  First-tier  Judge  and  recorded  in  his
    determination.   It  would,  however,  be  as  well  for  the  sake  of
    completeness if I make some reference to other aspects  of  the  First-
    tier Judge's preserved  findings  at  paragraph  21  and  partially  at
    paragraph 23.  Insofar  as  paragraph  21  of  the  First-tier  Judge's
    determination is concerned,  he  summarised  the  findings  within  the
    determination of Immigration Judge Oxlade following the hearing  before
    her on 28 June 2010 in which the Appellant's then-appeal was dismissed.
     Those findings were in summary that the Sponsor had been  resident  in
    the United Kingdom since 1996; that the Appellant was not a  member  of
    his household or his dependant in 1996 when  he  left  for  the  United
    Kingdom; that the Appellant and the Sponsor  had  not  since  formed  a
    household; and finally that the Appellant had not  been  his  dependant
    either in the period 2000 to 2005 when she and her sister  were  living
    together in Nigeria or in the period 2005 to 2008 after her sister left
    for the United Kingdom and when she was a student.  Those findings were
    properly considered by the First-tier Judge as her  starting  point  in
    accordance with Devaseelan principles.  See now also  Mubu  and  Others
    (immigration appeals - res judicata) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT  00398  (IAC)
    to which I referred at paragraph  16  of  my  error  of  law  decision,
    annexed hereto.

5.   At the time of  the  error  of  law  hearing  and  as  recorded  in  my
    subsequent decision thereon, I set out in some  detail  (see  paragraph
    18) the documents that were before the  First-tier  Judge  and  gave  a
    brief description as to each,  and  identified  those  aspects  of  the
    documentation that the  First-tier  Judge  clearly  disregarded,  which
    indeed in the event, formed part of the errors of law that I identified
    within her determination.

6.    Prior to the hearing before me on 14 June 2013, the Tribunal  received
    from the Appellant a fresh and comprehensive bundle of  documents  upon
    which they relied that in effect encompassed  all  the  documents  that
    were before the First-tier Judge but with some  further  clarification.
    At the outset of the resumed hearing, I received from Mr Kannangara his
    skeleton argument that I have carefully considered in conjunction  with
    the documentation before me.

7.   It will suffice for the purposes of this  determination,  to  refer  to
    the fact that Mr Tarlow who now represented the Respondent, told me  at
    the outset of  the  hearing,  that  having  carefully  considered  that
    documentation and other evidence, he was in  a  position  to  helpfully
    inform me as follows:

         "Having carefully  considered  the  documents  and  other  evidence
         before me, I am content to put it this way - that I  formally  rely
         on the refusal letter but otherwise have nothing further to add and
         shall leave it to you to  determine  the  matter  on  the  evidence
         before you.  It is not my  position  that  for  this  purpose,  and
         mindful of that evidence, there will be any need for  you  to  hear
         oral evidence today."

8.   Nonetheless, and for the avoidance of doubt, Mr Kannangara was able  to
    readily confirm to me that having  taken  instructions  from  both  the
    Appellant and her witnesses - comprising  the  Appellant's  sister  and
    brother-in-law (the Sponsor) - that they were all content to adopt  the
    evidence that they had already given in their statements and indeed  as
    accurately recorded by the First-tier Judge in her determination.






The Legal Framework

9.   In his most helpful skeleton argument, Mr  Kannangara  referred  me  to
    several decisions that he considered to be relevant  to  the  issue  at
    hand, and indeed I have found them to be so relevant. In that regard  I
    am mindful that at the outset  of  the  resumed  hearing,  the  parties
    agreed with me that what had to be  established  was  either  that  the
    Appellant could show prior and present dependency on the EEA Sponsor or
    prior membership of  a  household  and  prior  dependency  on  her  EEA
    Sponsor.

10.  Indeed such was the guidance of  the  Upper  Tribunal  in  Dauhoo  (EEA
    Regulations - Reg 8(2)) [2012] UKUT 79 (IAC) in relation to  which  the
    headnote had this to say:

         "Under the scheme set out in reg 8 (2) of the Immigration (European
         Economic  Area)  Regulations  2006,  a  person   can   succeed   in
         establishing that he or she is an "extended family member"  in  any
         one of four different  ways,  each  of  which  requires  proving  a
         relevant connection both prior to arrival in the UK and in the UK:


         i.          prior dependency and present dependency


         ii.          prior membership of a household and present membership
             of a household


         iii.           prior  dependency  and  present  membership   of   a
             household;


         iv.           prior  membership  of   a   household   and   present
             dependency.


         It  is  not  necessary,  therefore,  to  show  prior  and   present
         connection in the same capacity:  i.e.  dependency-  dependency  or
         household membership-household membership ((i) or  (ii)  above).  A
         person may also qualify if able to show (iii) or (iv)."

11.  In RK (OFM - membership of a household - dependency) India [2010]  UKUT
    421 (IAC) it was pointed out, inter alia, that:

         "For an OFM to fulfil the household requirement he or she must have
         lived with the Union citizen in the same country at  some  time  in
         the past, whilst dependency  requires  no  such  link.  Further  as
         dependency can be on the non national spouse  of  a  Union  citizen
         that opens up the reasonable  possibility  of  continued  residence
         outside the EEA after such a non national spouse  has  married  and
         moved to the EEA. ... Dependency [does] not have  to  be  whole  or
         main or necessary but there has merely to be economic dependency in
         fact."

12.  With that guidance in mind I have turned my attention in particular  to
    the documentation put forward by the Appellant,  as  clarified  in  the
    Upper Tribunal guidance to which I have above referred.




Assessment

13.  I begin with the documents  put  forward  to  support  the  Appellant's
    contention that whilst living in Nigeria, her country  of  origin,  she
    lived at the relevant time with her sister in accommodation in relation
    to which the rent was paid by the EEA Sponsor, the Appellant's sister's
    future husband.

14.  It was of course the Appellant's account that she and  her  sister  Mrs
    Adesuwa Uwechu were born in Benin City, Nigeria, and that in  1992  her
    sister met her husband (the Sponsor) Mr Emeka Uwechu and they started a
    relationship.  In 1996 armed robbers visited their home and  they  were
    attacked.  In consequence and upon hearing this,  Mr  Uwechu,  when  he
    visited Nigeria, asked them both to move to Abuja  where  it  would  be
    safer, and so the two sisters moved to Abuja with the  Sponsor  and  he
    paid for the accommodation for both of them.  Evidence of this  can  be
    correlated upon a consideration of the documentation within pages 32 to
    36 of the Appellant's bundle.  This discloses a tenancy agreement at an
    address, namely Plot 343, Bamako Street, Wuse Zone 1 Abuja and dated  1
    June 2004 that clearly shows the tenants to  be  the  Sponsor  and  the
    Appellant's sister,  each  of  which  had  indeed,  together  with  the
    landlord, signed the agreement.

15.  The Appellant's evidence continued that  her  sister  and  the  Sponsor
    were married on 8 January 2005 and moved to the United  Kingdom  on  29
    January 2005.  The Appellant repeated that before their relocation  she
    and her sister were both dependent on the Sponsor (the  sister's  then-
    fianc�) from the year 2000 and had lived at various temporarily  rented
    apartments in Abuja, Nigeria.  That claim is further identified in  the
    Appellant's bundle at page 39 that discloses the  Appellant's  sister's
    international driving licence and gives an address at  Plot  88,  Utako
    District, Abuja.

16.  Further, at pages 41 and 42 of the bundle, there appear  two  documents
    comprising a Statutory Affidavit of Declaration of the  Appellant  that
    shows her as living at the Utako District address and which is dated  4
    May 2006.  It is of course significant that it  is  a  sworn  document,
    indeed sworn at  the  Court  of  Appeal  registry  in  Abuja  before  a
    Commissioner  for  Oaths.   The  second  document  is  described  as  a
    "Certificate of State of Origin" issued by the Government of Edo  State
    of Nigeria Liaison Office further certifying the Appellant as  residing
    at that address and dated 4 May 2006.

17.  It was also the Appellant's evidence that she was able to  produce  her
    Nigerian driver's licence and national  identity  card,  all  of  which
    appear at page 40 of the bundle and which again shows the Appellant  as
    living at Bamako Crescent.  It is a driving licence issued in  February
    2004 expiring in July 2007.

18.  I have also taken account of page 45 of the  bundle  that  discloses  a
    copy of a Memorandum and Articles of Association of  a  company  called
    "Uzade Nigeria Limited" that bears a stamp  of  verification  from  the
    Corporate Affairs Commission of Nigeria and is dated 23 November  2004.
    Of significance is that the address of the director of the  company  is
    shown as 344 Bamako District and that the director concerned is  indeed
    the Appellant's sister Adesuwa Uzebu.

19.  My attention has been further drawn to page 45(a) of  the  bundle  that
    again relates to the same memorandum and on this occasion  also  refers
    to a co-director as indeed being the Sponsor, and shows his address  in
    Abuja as the same 344 Bamako Crescent.

20.  For the sake of completeness I have also taken  account  of  a  further
    document  on  page  43  of  the  Appellant's  bundle,  that  being  the
    Appellant's identity card issued by the Federal Republic of Nigeria and
    which shows her to at that stage,  to  be  living  at  the  Aminu  Kano
    address in Abuja.

21.  Taking all of these documents  together  cumulatively,  if  not  indeed
    individually, it is readily apparent to me that they wholly support  in
    a cogent  and probative way, the accounts given  by  the  Appellant  as
    reflected in her witness statement and oral evidence before the  First-
    tier Judge as to her situation in Nigeria from  2000  onwards,  and  in
    such circumstances and in light of the  fresh  evidence  before  me,  I
    differ from the conclusion reached by Immigration Judge Oxlade  in  her
    determination of June 2010 where she concluded, inter  alia,  that  the
    Appellant had not been the Sponsor's dependant  either  in  the  period
    2000 to 2005 when she and her sister were living together  in  Nigeria.
    The evidence before me taken together, and  mindful  of  the  requisite
    standard of proof to a balance of probabilities,  demonstrates  to  the
    contrary.

22.  The matter does not  of  course  end  there,  because  the  Appellant's
    bundle of  documents  proceeds  to  identify  documentation  that  runs
    contrary to Judge Oxlade's conclusion that the Appellant had failed  to
    demonstrate her dependency on the Sponsor in the period  2005  to  2008
    after her sister left the United Kingdom and when she  was  a  student.
    This of course is evidence that, in fairness to Judge Oxlade,  was  not
    before her, and indeed was evidence that I earlier  identified  in  the
    error of law hearing as documentation constituting fresh evidence  that
    had been overlooked or disregarded by First-tier Judge  Roland  in  his
    determination.

23.  That documentation is as follows; firstly, at pages 20  to  23  of  the
    bundle there appears a series of University of Benin cards.   I  should
    explain, to put the Appellant's account in its context and as it cross-
    relates to those documents, that it has always been  her  account  that
    when her sister left Abuja to join the Sponsor,  her  husband,  in  the
    United Kingdom, the Appellant had to stay behind due to  her  admission
    to the University  of  Benin,  Microbiology  Department,  during  which
    period the rent had already been paid in advance for the period by  the
    Sponsor thus enabling the Appellant to stay on at the accommodation  in
    Bamako Crescent until such time as her school  programme  started.   It
    was her account that the Sponsor and her sister between them thereafter
    continued paying for a room for the Appellant in a three  bedroom  flat
    at Flat 6, Plot 88, Utako District, Abuja, and indeed  confirmation  of
    that tenancy and the connection of that property with the  Sponsor  and
    the  Appellant's  sister  has  already   been   demonstrated   by   the
    documentation to which I have above referred.

24.  It was the Appellant's account that during the period of her  study  at
    university her brother-in-law had become accustomed to taking  care  of
    her, and that he continued to cater for her daily and academic needs by
    sending both financial  and  material  support  through  relatives  and
    friends who have been regular travellers to Nigeria.  I shall refer  to
    that aspect of her account later in this determination.   However,  for
    the present purpose the  student  cards  at  pages  20  to  23  show  a
    "clearance" card issued by the University Bursar's  Department  of  the
    Students Accounts Division  and  this  identifies  the  Appellant,  the
    courses that she has  undertaken,  her  student  number,  that  she  is
    attached to the Faculty  of  Life-Sciences  but  more  particularly  it
    identifies the Sponsor as Mr Emeka Uwechue, the Appellant's Sponsor and
    brother-in-law.  There are indeed several clearance  cards  before  me,
    all of which display the same information.

25.  There is also at page 24 of the bundle, a hospital receipt  issued  out
    of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital in Benin City and dated  3
    June 2008.  It was the Appellant's evidence that in or around June 2008
    she suffered a serious bout of malaria such as to result in  her  being
    hospitalised  for  one  week.   The  hospital  receipt  identifies  the
    Appellant and there are in fact two receipts, one of which refers to  a
    consultation fee of 759 Naira, and the other fees for  the  Appellant's
    inpatient treatment and X-rays totalling 3,250  Naira.  It  is  notable
    that in relation to both receipts there is stated clearly that  payment
    was received from Mr Emeka Uwechue, the Appellant's brother-in-law  and
    Sponsor.

26.  It was  also  the  Appellant's  evidence  that  her  brother-in-law  in
    sending monies for her material support through relatives and  friends,
    more particularly utilised the services of a  Mr  Richard  Bello-Osagie
    and Mr Edwin I E Diejomaoh.  It was claimed that the Sponsor sent funds
    through them because he was certain that they were easily accessible to
    the Appellant and that it was a cheaper,  faster  and  more  convenient
    method for him to send the Appellant money without having  to  pay  any
    commission.  He had, however, on  some  occasions  sent  money  to  the
    Appellant through Western Union Money Transfer when he could  not  find
    anyone travelling and the Appellant needed urgent funding.

27.  That claim is indeed supported by the sworn affidavits of Mr  Diejomaoh
    and Mr Osagie.  Mr Diejomaoh's affidavit appears over pages 5 and 6  of
    the bundle and it would be as well to set out in full what  he  had  to
    say.  The affidavit was sworn on 17 September 2010  and  states,  inter
    alia, as follows:

         "1.  That I have been a family friend of Mr Emeka and  Mrs  Adesuwa
             Uwechue since 2005.


         2.   That during my numerous visits to Nigeria, I  have  helped  Mr
             Emeka and Mrs Adesuwa Uwechue to take money, ranging from �100
             to �500 (one hundred to five hundred pounds) from  the  UK  to
             their dependant Ms Osemwonyenwen Uzebu (also known as Titi) as
             listed below, who was at that time  in  Nigeria  and  I  later
             gathered was encouraged to remain to complete  her  University
             Education in Nigeria before coming to join  them  in  the  UK.
             She was dependent upon them and  these  monies  were  for  her
             upkeep, academic pursuit and at some point  for  her  UK  visa
             application, to the best of my knowledge.
         3.   Below are listed the dates of my travels and returns, as  well
             as the amount in cash that was given to me by Mr Emeka and Mrs
             Adesuwa Uwechue to give to their dependant Ms O  Uzebu  (Titi)
             for the purposes stated above.


             (i)  On 17/08/2006 to 06/09/2006 Mr and Mrs  Uwechue  gave  me
                  �200 to Ms O Uzebu.


             (ii) On 15/03/2007 to 03/04/2007 Mr and Mrs  Uwechue  gave  me
                  �100 to Ms O Uzebu.


             (iii)    On 16/08/2007 to 15/09/2007 Mr and Mrs  Uwechue  gave
                  me �500 to Ms O Uzebu.


             (iv) On 19/03/2008 to 01/04/2008 Mr and Mrs  Uwechue  gave  me
                  �350 to Ms O Uzebu.


             (v)  On 02/07/2008 to 29/07/2008 Mr and Mrs  Uwechue  gave  me
                  �250 to Ms O Uzebu.


         4.   As receipts were not in any way involved in our dealings,  but
             a matter of friendship, trust and cash moving from one hand to
             the other, I have attached  photocopies  of  my  international
             passport showing my various journeys to Nigeria and back  with
             confirmatory dates and I  am  willing  to  give  testimony  if
             necessary to this effect."

28.  Indeed there is further exhibited to those affidavits and  they  appear
    in the Appellant's bundle, those international passport details.

29.  Mr Osagie's affidavit and accompanying attachments  appear  over  pages
    11 to 19 of the Appellant's bundle. It will suffice to say that in that
    affidavit, Mr Osagie also makes reference to his dates of  travel  from
    the United Kingdom and Nigeria, the amounts that he was given from  the
    Appellant's brother-in-law and sister  to  give  to  the  Appellant  in
    Nigeria, and again the accompanying  copy  passport  details  including
    exit and entry stamps, that correlate with the  dates  that  Mr  Osagie
    gave within his affidavit.  He also adds in his affidavit that he is  a
    cousin of the Appellant and her sister and that  he  formerly  owned  a
    Western Union business which was still functioning  and  through  which
    money was sometimes sent to the Appellant on the part  of  the  Sponsor
    and his wife for the Appellant's benefit in  Nigeria.   I  pause  there
    because I regard that as additional evidence  of  Western  Union  money
    transfers in addition to the single receipt that has been  produced  to
    reflect those transfers that also appear within the Appellant's bundle.



30.  Mr Osagie in his affidavit also adds that during  his  various  travels
    to Nigeria the sort  of  things  that  he  used  to  transport  on  the
    Sponsor's behalf to the Appellant  not  only  included  cash  but  also
    "letters, documents, clothes, shoes, toiletries and some food items".

31.  Mr  Osagie's  affidavit  further  confirms  that  the  Appellant  is  a
    dependant of the Sponsor and the Appellant's sister and  that  she  was
    studying at the University of Benin, Nigeria "and needed this money for
    her upkeep both in school and outside school".

32.  As I say, evidence of Western Union money transfers  not  only  derives
    from the single Western Union receipt that appears in  the  bundle  but
    from the affidavit of  Mr  Osagie  and  indeed  the  statement  of  the
    Sponsor.

33.  It was the Sponsor's further account in maintaining that she  had  been
    totally dependent on him since  2000  to  date,  both  financially  and
    materially, that it was agreed between  her  and  her  sister  and  the
    Sponsor, that she would come and visit them in the United Kingdom  once
    a year during her long school holidays and that she did so  between  23
    October 2006 and 1 February 2007. It was the Appellant's evidence  that
    she was unable to do so in 2007  because  of  her  school's  industrial
    attachment program which had lasted till she  resumed  the  final  year
    session.

34.   The Appellant continued that she was supposed to visit during her mid-
    term holiday in June/July 2008 but her visa was initially denied due to
    the British High Commission's doubts about her  being  a  student  that
    were eventually allayed such that she was granted a visa until  October
    2008. She stated that after her final examinations on 8 December  2008,
    she did make another visit and that on all the occasions of such visits
    the Sponsor paid for her air ticket.

  35. That contention is, I  find,  borne  out  from  further  documentation
    within the Appellant's bundle that appears over pages 28 and 29.   That
    evidence comes in several different forms.  Firstly, there is before me
    a copy of the Sponsor's credit card statement through Lloyds TSB  dated
    1 November 2006.  Within those entries there appears on 20 October,  an
    entry of the payment to British Airways in the sum  of  �400.10  and  a
    further payment of �3.67 by way of payment protection cover.  There  is
    also a copy of the Appellant's boarding card  relating  to  her  flight
    from Abuja to Heathrow on 23 October 2006 and her  return  flight  from
    London back to Abuja on Wednesday 31 January 2006.

36.  There is also before me the credit card statement  of  the  Appellant's
    sister dated 18 December 2008 that includes an entry dated  1  December
    2008 showing a payment to British Airways for �717.90 that clearly must
    relate to the air ticket upon which the  Appellant  travelled  in  that
    period and indeed which is reflected at page 31 of the  bundle  by  the
    production of the Appellant's boarding pass for those flights.

37.  Taking this documentation  into  account  both  individually  and  more
    particularly cumulatively, together with  the  evidence  given  by  the
    Appellant and her witnesses both oral and documentary, it  is  apparent
    to me, that not least to the requisite standard of proof, the Appellant
    has discharged the burden on her to show that she at all times met  the
    requirements of Regulation 8(2) of the  EEA  Regulations  2006.   I  am
    satisfied on that evidence, that the Appellant was dependent  and  part
    of the household of her Sponsor - her brother-in-law, an EEA national -
    and that of her sister, his wife.  I find therefore that she meets  the
    requirements  not  least  as  identified  in  (iii)  and  (iv)  and  as
    identified in the headnote to the decision of the  Tribunal  in  Dauhoo
    (above).

38.  I have further borne in mind the  guidance  of  the  Tribunal  both  in
    Aladeselu and Others (2006 Regs - Reg  8)  Nigeria  [2011]  UKUT  00253
    (IAC) and Ihemedu (OFMs meaning) Nigeria [2011] UKUT 00340 (IAC),  both
    of which make reference to the requirements of Regulation 17(4) of  the
    2006 Regulations that makes  the  issue  of  a  residence  card  to  an
    extended family member a matter of discretion.  Where the Secretary  of
    State has not yet exercised that discretion  the  most  an  Immigration
    Judge is entitled to do  is  to  allow  the  appeal  as  being  not  in
    accordance with the law, leaving the  matter  of  whether  to  exercise
    discretion in the Appellant's favour or not to the Secretary of  State.
    That of course is the guidance that I shall now follow.

39.  For the avoidance of doubt and in the light  of  my  findings,  I  have
    concluded that the Secretary of State has not acted in accordance  with
    the law and that the proper course for me is therefore  to  allow  this
    appeal to the extent that he now exercises his discretion  as  required
    by Regulation 17(4).

40.  I have, of course,  taken  the  trouble  to  ensure  in  reaching  this
    decision, that the Appellant's Sponsor is indeed an EEA national and  I
    have been so satisfied by reference to the Tribunal bundle where at  B1
    there is displayed a copy of the Sponsor's Polish passport issued on  7
    May 2010 and which does not expire until 7 May 2020.  On the  basis  of
    that evidence and  of  course  the  other  evidence  to  which  I  have
    referred, not least the Sponsor's own evidence, I am  wholly  satisfied
    that he is indeed a Polish national and therefore  a  national  of  the
    European Union.

Conclusions

41.  The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of an error on a point of law.

42.  I set aside the decision.

43.  I remake the decision in the appeal by allowing it to the  extent  that
    it is remitted to the Secretary of State to exercise her discretion  in
    accordance with the requirements of Regulation 17(4) of  the  2006  EEA
    Regulations.

Upper Tribunal Judge Goldstein

APPENDIX A

APPELLANT:    Osemwonyemwen Uzebu

RESPONDENT:   Secretary of State for the Home Department

CASE NO:      IA/18231/2012

DATE OF INITIAL HEARING IN UPPER TRIBUNAL: 27 February 2013


Representation:

For the Appellant:         Mr H Kannangara, Counsel
For the Respondent:    Ms H Horsley, Home Office Presenting Officer


REASONS FOR FINDING THAT TRIBUNAL MADE AN ERROR OF LAW, SUCH THAT ITS
DECISION FALLS TO BE SET ASIDE


1.   This is an appeal against the decision of the Respondent dated 24  July
    2012 to refuse to the Appellant  the  issue  of  a  residence  card  as
    confirmation of a right of residence under European  Community  law  as
    the family member of an EEA national exercising treaty  rights  in  the
    United Kingdom, the relevant Regulation being Regulation  8(2)  of  the
    Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006  that  states  as
    follows:

         "8(1)    In these Regulations  'extended  family  member'  means  a
               person who is not a family member of an EEA  national  under
               Regulation  7(1)(a),  (b)  or  (c)  and  who  satisfies  the
               conditions in paragraphs (2), (3), (4) or (5).


            (2)   the person satisfies the condition in  this  paragraph  if
               the person is the relative of an EEA national, his spouse or
               his civil partner and -


               (a)     the person is residing in an EEA State in which  the
                   EEA national also resides and is dependent upon the  EEA
                   national or is a member of his household;


               (b)     the person satisfied the condition in paragraph  (a)
                   and is accompanying  the  EEA  national  to  the  United
                   Kingdom or wishes to join him there; or


               (c)     the person satisfied the condition in paragraph (a),
                   has joined the EEA national in the  United  Kingdom  and
                   continues to be dependent upon him or to be a member  of
                   his household".

2.   In her Reasons for Refusal Letter, the Secretary of  State  noted  that
    the Appellant had provided a Western  Union  money  statement  dated  2
    August 2006 to show that she had been sent funds by her sister  in  the
    United Kingdom, but there was no evidence to show  that  she  had  been
    relying upon her EEA Sponsor prior to entering the United Kingdom.

3.   It was further contended that  the  Appellant  had  failed  to  provide
    evidence that she was a member of her EEA family member's household  in
    Nigeria and to provide any evidence that she established her  financial
    dependency or household relationship with her Sponsor  in  the  country
    from which they moved to the United Kingdom.

4.   Further that the Appellant also failed to  provide  any  evidence  that
    her financial dependency or household  relationship  with  her  Sponsor
    existed immediately before or very recently before  they  came  to  the
    United Kingdom.

5.   It was also contended that the Appellant  failed  to  demonstrate  that
    she arrived in the United Kingdom at the same time as her  EEA  Sponsor
    or shortly after him.

6.    Therefore it had been decided to  refuse  the  confirmation  that  the
    Appellant sought, with reference to Regulation 8(2)(a), (b) and (c)  of
    the 2006 EEA Regulations.

7.   The Appellant's appeal came before First-tier Tribunal  Judge  Rowlands
    who sitting at Hatton  Cross  on  3  and  30  October  2012  and  in  a
    determination  promulgated  on  21   November   2012,   dismissed   the
    Appellant's appeal.

8.   In his determination the Judge recorded the content of the  Appellant's
    witness  statement  and  her  oral  evidence  particularly  in   cross-
    examination.   He  also  heard  and  recorded  the  evidence   of   the
    Appellant's Sponsor, her brother-in-law Emeka Uwechue who relied on his
    witness statement that the Judge set out in full.   Evidence  was  also
    heard from the Appellant's witness, her boyfriend.

9.   The Judge noted that there had been previous applications made  by  the
    Appellant and previous findings by Judges.  He  had  been  specifically
    referred to the determination of Immigration Judge Oxlade  following  a
    hearing on 28 June 2010 in which she dismissed the  Appellant's  appeal
    against the refusal of her application for a residence  card.   It  was
    noted that Judge Oxlade concluded in terms of the relationship  between
    the Appellant and her Sponsor that:

         "(a) Mr Uwechue has been resident in the United Kingdom since  1996
             and has not lived in  Nigeria  since  then  (although  he  has
             visited).


          (b) The Appellant was  not  a  member  of  his  household  or  his
             dependent in 1996 when he left for the  United  Kingdom  as  a
             student.


          (c) The Appellant and Mr Uwechue had not formed a household  since
             then.


          (d) The Appellant has not been his dependent either in the  period
             2000 to 2005 when she and her sister were living  together  in
             Nigeria nor in the period 2005 to 2008 after her  sister  left
             for the United Kingdom when she was a student".

10.  It was noted that in an appeal against  that  determination  the  Upper
    Tribunal reached the view that those conclusions were properly open  to
    Judge Oxlade on the evidence.

11.  The Judge made reference to the case of Devaseelan*  and  at  paragraph
    22 of his determination continued as follows:

         "22. The case of Devaseelan suggests that the conclusion reached by
             previous Judges should, in the absence of evidence  compelling
             to the contrary,  be  the  starting  point  for  me.   I  have
             considered all the evidence that I have been provided and  can
             see no reason to reach a different conclusion to that of Judge
             Oxlade so far as those facts  are  concerned.   There  was  no
             additional evidence given to me and indeed although there  may
             have been some written evidence from persons claiming to  have
             taken funds on behalf of the Sponsor to  the  Appellant  there
             was no additional evidence called and given in person  to  the
             Court.  (Emphasis added)


         23.  Whilst I am satisfied the Appellant  has  shown  that  she  is
             related as claimed to the Appellant's wife and has dealt  with
             the issue inadvertently raised by the  Respondent  during  the
             first hearing, I am not satisfied  that  she  has  shown  that
             there was anything different to that  which  applied  back  in
             2010 that her inability to be able to show  that  she  fulfils
             the  requirements  of  the  relevant  EEA  Regulation  remains
             exactly the same now as it did then". (Emphasis added)

12.  The Judge thus proceeded to dismiss the appeal.

13.   The  Appellant  subsequently  made  a   successful   application   for
    permission to appeal that decision in  which  it  was  contended  inter
    alia, that the First-tier Tribunal Judge  was  simply  relying  on  the
    previous determination of Immigration Judge Oxlade submitting  that  it
    was not appropriate for the Judge's decision to  use  as  her  starting
    point, the Devaseelan principles in cases  where  the  appeal  was  not
    under the Immigration Rules but under the 2006 EEA Regulations.

14.  It is right to say that most fairly and in my  view  realistically,  Mr
    Kannangara at the outset of the hearing before me,  clarified  that  he
    was no longer pursuing that ground of appeal.

15.  He was quite right to do so.  A judicial assessment  of  facts  in  the
    past has to be a starting point.  Indeed if nothing else was offered it
    would be bizarre if a different view was taken to  an  unchallenged  or
    unchallengeable judgment made some ago.

16.    Ms Horsley further most helpfully provided me with the transcript  of
    the decision of the Tribunal in Mubu and Others (Immigration Appeals  -
    Res Judicata) Zimbabwe [2012] UKUT 00398 (IAC) in which the  head  note
    states inter alia as follows:

         "The guide lines set out in  Devaseelan  [2002]  UKIAT  00702;  are
         always to be applied to the determination of a factual  issue,  the
         dispute as to which  has  already  been  the  subject  of  judicial
         determination in an appeal against an earlier immigration  decision
         involving the same party.  This is so whether the  finding  in  the
         earlier determination was in favour, or against, the  Secretary  of
         State".

17.  The grounds of application continued that  the  Immigration  Judge  had
    before him a bundle of supporting documents that included,  apart  from
    the witness statements, "many documents that prove  the  Appellant  was
    living as part of the household of an EEA national spouse  (Appellant's
    sister) while they were living in Nigeria".

18.  The grounds continued as follows:

         "6.  The documents in the below mentioned  pages  proved  that  the
             Appellant was living  in  the  same  household  with  the  EEA
             national spouse (Appellant's sister):

                . pages 32-36 (tenancy agreement of one  address  they  both
                  lived);

                . page 39 (the sister's international driver's  licence  (at
                  pages 41 to 42);

               . page 43 (Appellant's ID  card)  and  page  44  (Appellant's
                 sister's certificate of state of origin);

               . page 45 the address in Bamako Crescent and a  copy  of  the
                 Appellant's driver's licence - copy was given to the  Judge
                 separately.

           7. It is also submitted that the documents in the below mentioned
             pages  proved  that  the  EEA  national  was  paying  for  the
             Appellant's university  fees  and  hospital  bills.   The  EEA
             national's name was clearly mentioned in the documents:

                . pages 20 to 23 (university clearance cards);

                . page 24 (hospital bills);

                . page 27 (Western Union receipt);

               . pages 28 and 29 (the EEA national's  card  payment  details
                 when he paid for Appellant's air ticket to come to  the  UK
                 in 2006 with a copy of the air ticket;

               . pages 30 and 31 (the EEA national's bank statement  showing
                 the payment he made to British Airways for the Appellant to
                 come to the UK in  2008  and  a  copy  of  the  Appellant's
                 ticket).

         8.   The  above-mentioned  documents  clearly  suggested  that  the
             Appellant was dependent and a part of the household of the EEA
             national and/or his spouse.  It  was  also  submitted  to  the
             Judge at the hearing that the above-mentioned  documents  were
             not  available  to  the  previous  Immigration   Judge.    The
             Appellant did not have those documents at that time and  after
             that appeal was  dismissed  by  the  Tribunal,  the  Appellant
             managed to get those documents from Nigeria and made the fresh
             application.




          9.  It is respectfully submitted that the  Immigration  Judge  had
             not  given  any  consideration  to  the  documentary  evidence
             available to (him) and also failed to  adequately  reason  his
             decision".


19.  Prior to the hearing of the appeal before  me,  the  Tribunal  received
    the Respondent's Rule 24 response dated 27 December 2012  that  notably
    omitted to challenge that part of the grounds of application as set out
    above and solely challenged that part of the  grounds  that  questioned
    the First-tier Tribunal Judge's  right  to  invoke  the  principles  of
    Devaseelan to an EEA appeal.

20.  Thus the appeal came before me on 27 February 2013 when my  first  task
    was to determine whether the determination of the  First-tier  Tribunal
    Judge disclosed an error or errors on a point of law such as might have
    materially affected the outcome of the appeal.

21.  There followed an exercise between myself and  the  parties'  in  which
    the  documents  referred  to  in  the  grounds  of   application   were
    painstakingly gone through and clarified and it  will  suffice  to  say
    that in consequence, I was wholly satisfied, that with the exception of
    the documents at pages 5 and 6, 11 and 12 and 29 and 31, the  remaining
    documents before the First-tier Tribunal Judge clearly  did  amount  to
    fresh evidence arguably material to the outcome of  the  appeal  before
    him, in particular the following:

    Flight ticket to proof of payment by the Sponsor and the
    Appellant's sister     -   pages 29 and 30


    Lloyds Bank statement and credit cards  -    page 28


    Appellant's driving licence


    Sister's registration card -    page 45


    Western Union money transfer    -   page 27


    Hospital receipts      -   page 24


    Clearance cards   -    pages 20 and 23

22.  Mr Kannangara proceeded to set out their relevance to  the  Appellant's
    case and the manner in which he submitted that they  demonstrated  that
    the Appellant met the requirements  of  Regulation  8(2)(b)  which   he
    submitted, was the sole issue that the First-tier Judge was required to
    determine.

23.  Whilst Ms Horsley had initially sought to argue that the  determination
    of the First-tier Tribunal Judge demonstrated  consideration  to  these
    documents, it was with great respect to her, clear to me, that  upon  a
    reading of the determination that was not at  all  the  case.   It  was
    apparent to me that the Judge's reasoning in dismissing the appeal, was
    wholly predicated upon the previous findings of Judge Oxlade and on her
    clearly mistaken understanding that there was  no  additional  evidence
    before her and thus no reason for  the  Judge  "to  reach  a  different
    conclusion  to  that  of  Judge  Oxlade  so  far  as  those  facts  are
    concerned".

24.  It was apparent to me that the  Judge  failed  to  give  the  documents
    before him the anxious scrutiny that they deserved  and  if  they  were
    simply overlooked, then it follows that she made  a  mistake  of  fact,
    clearly material to the outcome of this appeal.

25.  In those circumstances, I had no difficulty in  informing  the  parties
    that I was satisfied that for those reasons, the Judge  had  materially
    erred  in  law  and  that  his  decision  to  dismiss  the  Appellant's
    immigration appeal should be set aside.

26.  It was however agreed with the parties that  those  paragraphs  in  the
    Judge's  determination  recording  the  Appellant  and  the  witnesses'
    several statements and their oral evidence could be preserved, as could
    paragraph 21 of her findings.  Paragraph 23 could be preserved but only
    to the extent that the First-tier Judge found that  the  Appellant  was
    related to the Sponsor's wife namely as her sister.  However  the  rest
    of that paragraph was not to be preserved.  Paragraph 22 was not to  be
    preserved.

27.  It was decided that the appeal would be  reserved  to  myself  for  the
    first available date, Listing to check with Mr Kannangara's clerk  (020
    7583 8595) as to his availability before fixing a date.  I was informed
    that the Appellant and her sister (subject to her being able to  do  so
    having just given birth to her baby) and  the  Appellant's  brother-in-
    law, the Sponsor, would be giving oral evidence before me  in  relation
    to which no interpreter would be  required.   There  would  be  a  time
    estimate of 3 hours.   I  also  made  appropriate  directions  for  the
    resumed hearing.
