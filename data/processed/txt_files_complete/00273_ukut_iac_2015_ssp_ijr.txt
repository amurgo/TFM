Judge Gill:

Introduction and background facts:

 1. The applicant is a national of India. By an  order  dated  14  November
    2014, the Upper Tribunal granted her permission to challenge  a  letter
    dated 4 January 2014 (hereafter the  "invalidity  decision")  from  the
    respondent by which the respondent rejected her application of  2  July
    2013 for leave to remain as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant  on  the  ground
    that s.3C(4) of the Immigration Act 1971 (the "1971 Act") precluded her
    from making the application whilst her leave was extended  under  s.3C.
    The respondent considered that she had made her application of  2  July
    2013 whilst  she  had  an  outstanding  appeal  before  the  First-tier
    Tribunal (Immigration  and  Asylum  Chamber)  ("FtT").  The  appeal  in
    question was an appeal under reference: IA/06726/2013.

 2. The applicant's case (in summary) is that she withdrew her  appeal  and
    simultaneously  made  her  application  for  leave  and  therefore  her
    application was not  precluded  by  s.3C(4).  The  relevant  chronology
    (insofar as appears from the file) is as follows:

         27 Oct 2009   Applicant  entered  the  U.K.  with  entry  clearance
                       valid from 27 October 2006 until 25 June  2011  as  a
                       Tier 4 (General) Migrant

         16 Apr  2011    Application  for  leave  to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
                       (General) Migrant

         2 Sept 2011   Licence of sponsor-college revoked

         5 Nov 2012    Respondent allowed the applicant a  period  of  leave
                       of 60 days to find another sponsor-college and submit
                       a new application

         13 Feb 2013   Application refused with a right of appeal

         28 Feb 2013   Appeal lodged (IA/06726/2013)

         2 July 2013   Email from applicant's representatives to  respondent
                       timed at 12:40 stating  that  they  had  instructions
                       from the applicant to withdraw her appeal  which  was
                       listed for hearing on 3 July 2013 before the FtT

          2  July  2013    Letter  sent  at   15:21   by   the   applicant's
                       representatives to the FtT, stating:  "...our  client
                       would like to withdraw this appeal as they wanted  to
                       make [sic] fresh application to the  UKBA  to  extend
                       her status as a Tier 4 (G) student ..."

         2 July 2013   Application made for leave to  remain  as  a  Tier  4
                       (General) Migrant

         4 July 2013   "Notice of Withdrawal" (form IA52) sent  by  the  FtT
                       to the parties in appeal number: IA/06726/2013

         4 Jan 2014    Date of invalidity decision

 3. The decision of the Upper  Tribunal  granting  permission  states  that
    notice of withdrawal was made by email at 12:40  on  2  July  2013.  In
    fact, this email could not operate as a withdrawal because it was  sent
    to the respondent. However, the facsimile message sent to the FtT on  2
    July 2013 at 15:21 did operate as a withdrawal.

Reasons for proceeding in the absence of the applicant

 4. The applicant sent an email to the respondent on 10 April 2015  stating
    that she wished to withdraw her claim for judicial review. On 14  April
    2015, when administrative staff of the Upper Tribunal  telephoned  her,
    she informed the Upper Tribunal that she wished to withdraw  her  claim
    and would not be attending the hearing. She was advised  to  submit  an
    application notice in order to withdraw her claim.  She  said  she  was
    unable to attend  the  Upper  Tribunal's  fees  office  to  submit  the
    application notice on the same day. I did not consider  it  appropriate
    to treat the claim as withdrawn given that there was nothing in writing
    from the applicant to the Upper Tribunal to that effect.

 5. On the hearing day, there was no appearance by  or  on  behalf  of  the
    applicant at 10.00 am nor by 11.00 am. I was satisfied  not  only  that
    the notice of the hearing had been duly given to the applicant but also
    that she was aware of the hearing date,  given  the  conversation  that
    took place between her and a member of the administrative staff of  the
    Upper Tribunal on 14 April. There was no reason to think that,  if  the
    hearing were  to  be  adjourned,  the  applicant  might  attend  or  be
    represented at the next hearing. In all of the circumstances,  and  for
    the reasons given, I decided to exercise my discretion to proceed  with
    the hearing. I heard briefly from Ms Scolding.

    The relevant provisions

 6. The version of s. 3C of the 1971 Act which is relevant in this claim is
    the version that was in force from 31 August 2006 to 19  October  2014.
    This provided as follows:


        "3C Continuation of leave pending variation decision


        (1)  This section applies if-


         (a) a person who has limited leave  to  enter  or  remain  in  the
               United  Kingdom  applies  to  the  Secretary  of  State   for
               variation of the leave,


         (b) the  application  for  variation  is  made  before  the  leave
        expires, and


         (c) the leave expires without the application for variation having
        been decided.


        (2)  The leave is extended by virtue of  this  section  during  any
        period when-


          (a)  the  application  for  variation  is  neither  decided   nor
        withdrawn,


         (b) an appeal under section 82(1) of the Nationality,  Asylum  and
               Immigration Act 2002 could be brought,  while  the  appellant
               is  in  the  United  Kingdom  against  the  decision  on  the
               application for variation (ignoring  any  possibility  of  an
               appeal out of time with permission), or


         (c) an appeal under that section against  that  decision,  brought
               while the appellant is in  the  United  Kingdom,  is  pending
               (within the meaning of section 104 of that Act).


        (3)  ...


        (4)  A person may not make an  application  for  variation  of  his
             leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom while that leave
             is extended by virtue of this section.


        (5)  But subsection (4) does  not  prevent  the  variation  of  the
             application mentioned in subsection (1)(a).


        (6)  ..."

 7. The relevant version of  s.104  of  the  Nationality,  Immigration  and
    Asylum Act 2002 (the "2002 Act") is the version that was in force  from
    15 February 2010 until 19 October 2014. This provided as follows:


        "104 Pending appeal


        (1)  An appeal under section 82(1) is pending during the period-


         (a) beginning when it is instituted, and


         (b)  ending when it is finally determined, withdrawn  or  abandoned
                 (or when it lapses under section 99)."

 8. As at 2 July 2013, rule 17  of  the  Asylum  and  Immigration  Tribunal
    (Procedure) Rules 2005 (the "FtT Rules") provided (insofar as relevant)
    as follows:

         "17. Withdrawal of appeal
              (1) An appellant may withdraw an appeal-
                  (a) orally, at a hearing; or
                  (b) at  any  time,  by  filing  written  notice  with  the
Tribunal.
              (2) ...
              (2A)     ...
              (3) If an appeal is withdrawn or  treated  as  withdrawn,  the
                 Tribunal must serve on the parties a notice that the appeal
                 has been recorded as having been withdrawn."

 9. The version of paras 6 and 34G of  the  Statement  of  Changes  in  the
    Immigration Rules HC 395 (as amended) (the "IRs") in force as at 2 July
    2013 provided (insofar as relevant) as follows:

     ""date of application" means the date of application determined in
         accordance with paragraph 30 or 34G of these rules as appropriate."

         "30  [Not relevant]"


        "Determination of the date of an application or claim (or variation
        of an application or claim) in connection with immigration.


        34G  For the  purposes  of  these  rules,  the  date  on  which  an
             application or claim (or a variation in  accordance  with  para
             34E) is made is as follows:


         (i) where the application form  is  sent  by  post,  the  date  of
             posting,
         (ii) ..."

     Assessment

10. In my judgement and for the reasons given below, s.3C(4)  of  the  1971
    Act prohibits an application for leave to remain that is  made  on  the
    same day as, and  even  if  said  to  be  contemporaneously  with,  the
    applicant's withdrawal of his or her appeal before the FtT. I shall now
    give my reasons.

11. If an individual who has leave  to  remain  makes  an  application  for
    further leave before the expiry of his leave and a decision is not made
    before his leave expires, his leave  is  extended  under  s.3C(2).  Any
    application may be varied as long as any such variation is made  before
    a decision on the application is made. Once a decision has  been  made,
    S.3C(4) prohibits any further application for  leave  for  as  long  as
    leave is extended under s.3C (JH (Zimbabwe) [2009] EWCA Civ  78).  This
    means that, if an adverse decision attracting an  in-country  right  of
    appeal is made and an in-time appeal is brought, the individual's leave
    is extended under s.3C(2) for as long as the appeal is  pending  within
    the meaning  of  s.104(1)  of  the  2002  Act.  All  of  this  is  well
    established. A withdrawal of an appeal brings the appeal to an  end  so
    that it is  no  longer  "pending"  under  s.104(1)  and  therefore  the
    individual's s.3C leave will come to an end when his or her  appeal  is
    withdrawn. An application made after an appeal is no longer pending  is
    not prohibited by s.3C(4). However, as the individual's s.3C leave will
    have ended, the application will be one that is made at a time when the
    individual did not have leave. This is not controversial.

12. The  principal  question  in  this  case  is  whether  the  applicant's
    application of 2 July 2013 was "made" at  a  time  when  she  had  s.3C
    leave. If so,  her  application  was  prohibited  by  s.3C(4)  and  the
    respondent did not err in law in rejecting her application as  invalid.
    The ancillary questions that arise are therefore as follows:

    i.   When did the applicant's s.3C leave end? This requires considering
        when her withdrawal took effect, whether 4 July 2013 (when the  FtT
        sent the notice it is obliged to send under rule 17(3)) or  2  July
        2013 (the date that the letter from the applicant's withdrawing her
        appeal was sent by facsimile to the FtT).

    ii.  If the latter, whether it can be  said  that  she  had  a  pending
        appeal up until the precise moment she withdrew her appeal (in this
        case, up until 15:31 on 2 July 2013).

    iii. When did she "make" her application for leave dated  2  July  2013
        for the purposes of s.3C(4), i.e. whether it is 2 July 2013 or  the
        precise moment on 2 July 2013 when she posted her application?

13. In the summary grounds of defence, the respondent referred to the  fact
    that the FtT only confirmed the withdrawal on 4 July 2013. However, the
    language of rule 17  of  the  FtT  Rules  does  not  suggest  that  the
    withdrawal takes effect on the date that the FtT sends the notice  that
    it is obliged to send pursuant to rule 17(3) as opposed to the date  of
    the withdrawal. In my view, a withdrawal of an appeal takes effect from
    the date that the FtT is notified of the withdrawal, whether orally  or
    by written notice.

14. However, as to question ii, my attention has not been drawn to anything
    in rule 17 or the FtT Rules or any other provision or any authority  to
    the effect that for the purposes of s.3C withdrawals take  effect  only
    from a specified time on a specified day. The mere fact  that  the  FtT
    Rules are silent on the point does not mean that a  positive  inference
    can legitimately be drawn that a withdrawal  takes  effect  only  at  a
    specified time on a specified day. However, the answer to  question  ii
    is not determinative of this claim.  The  answer  to  question  iii  is
    determinative.

15. Turning therefore to question iii, there is nothing in para  34G  which
    provides for an application, if posted, to be taken as being made  only
    at a specified time on the day of posting. The applicant's argument, if
    accepted, would entail the Upper Tribunal reading words into  para  34G
    of the IRs that are simply not there, i.e. that "the date and  time  on
    which an application or claim .... (i) where the  application  form  is
    sent by post, at the date and time of posting." It is not open  to  the
    Upper Tribunal to do so. The IRs must be construed  sensibly  according
    to the natural meaning of the language employed: Supreme Court in Mahad
    and others [2009] UKSC 16. In my judgement, para  34G  is  sufficiently
    clear. An application is to be taken as having been  made,  if  it  was
    posted, on the day it was posted. It is sufficiently  clear  that  this
    means the whole of the day in question. If it were otherwise, one would
    expect to see references to the date and time of posting in the rule.

16. In relation to both questions ii and iii, the reason  why  the  grounds
    contend that s.3C(4) does not prohibit  an  application  that  is  made
    contemporaneously with the withdrawal  of  an  appeal  is  that  it  is
    thought - mistakenly - that s.3C(1) and  (2)  will  apply  to  the  new
    application so the applicant's leave continues  to  be  extended  under
    s.3C for as long as her application of 2 July 2013 awaits a decision or
    (if an adverse decision which gives rise to a right of appeal is  made)
    for as long as an appeal may be brought or (if an  appeal  is  brought)
    for as long as the appeal remains pending.

17. However, this would open s.3C to abuse. It would open  the  possibility
    of a series of applications leading  to  indefinite  extension  of  the
    original leave. The purpose of s.3C(4), i.e. to prevent a succession of
    applications for leave leading to indefinite extension of the  original
    leave, would be defeated (JH (Zimbabwe), para 36).

18. For  all  of  the  above  reasons,  I  conclude  that  the  applicant's
    application of 2 July 2013 was "made" on 2 July 2013 and that, for  the
    purposes of s.3C(4), this means that the whole of 2 July 2013 counts as
    the date of her application. It follows that she made  her  application
    at a time when her leave was being  extended  under  s.3C  because  her
    appeal was still pending, even on her own case, until a  moment  before
    15:31 on 2 July 2013.

19. The above are my reasons for rejecting the applicant's case in relation
    to s.3C and the reasons I rely upon in dismissing this claim.  However,
    even if I am wrong in everything I have said, this claim could not have
    succeeded, given that the applicant has not produced any evidence  that
    she posted the application of  2  July  2013  simultaneously  with  her
    withdrawal.

20. The grounds also contend  that  the  respondent  erred  by  failing  to
    consider Article 8 of the 1950 European Convention for  the  Protection
    of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. However, there is nothing  to
    show that the applicant put any case on the basis of Article  8  before
    the respondent as at the date of the invalidity decision.  Accordingly,
    the respondent was not obliged to consider Article 8. In any event, the
    applicant had only been in the United Kingdom for a period of  about  4
    years as at the date of the invalidity decision. She had only ever  had
    leave as a student. Article 8 does  not  protect  the  right  to  study
    (Patel [2013] UKSC 72, at para 57). The Article 8 ground  is  therefore
    hopeless.

     Decision

     The claim is dismissed.
