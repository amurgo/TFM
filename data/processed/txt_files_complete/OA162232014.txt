                      ENTRY CLEARANCE OFFICER - MANILA

                                                                   Appellant
                                     And

                            GLENN DELA PENA LANTO
                          (NO ANONYMITY ORDER MADE)

                                                                  Respondent


Representation:

For the Appellant:     Mr Staunton a Home Office Presenting Officer
For the Respondent:    No representation - his mother Gloria Lanto  attended
                    and made submissions on his behalf throughout

                            DECISION AND REASONS

Background


    1. For the purpose of continuity with the determination in  the  First-
       tier Tribunal I  will  hereinafter  refer  to  the  Entry  Clearance
       Officer as the Respondent and Mr Lanto as the Appellant.
    2. To ensure Mrs Lanto was able to  fully  participate  throughout  the
       hearing, I ensured that no complex or legal language  was  used  and
       all speech was clear and slowed down as English was not Mrs  Lanto's
       first language. She did not request an interpreter and when she made
       representations, her English was very good albeit  with  an  accent,
       slightly slow, and with a slightly  truncated  vocabulary.  All  the
       points she made were directly related to the matters put to  her.  I
       am satisfied she fully understood the proceedings.


    3. The Respondent refused the  Appellant's  application  for  leave  to
       enter as the dependent child of Mrs Lanto on 17 November  2014.  His
       appeal against  the  refusal  of  that  was  allowed  by  First-tier
       Tribunal Judge Holmes ("the Judge") following consideration  of  the
       papers on 17 August 2015.

The grant of permission


    4. Designated Judge Woodcraft granted permission to appeal (30 December
       2015) on the  following  ground.  It  is  arguable  that  the  Judge
       materially erred by taking into account evidence that on  6  January
       2015 (which was after the date of  the  Respondent's  decision)  Mrs
       Lanto was granted indefinite leave to remain here. At  the  date  of
       decision he  intended  to  come  for  longer  than  her  then  leave
       permitted in breach of paragraph 197 (v) of the Statement of Changes
       in Immigration Rules HC395 ("the rules").


Respondent's position

    5. Mr Staunton submitted, as stated in the grounds  seeking  permission
       to appeal, that the Judge was wrong to take  into  account  evidence
       that post  dated  the  decision  given  Section  85  (5)(b)  of  the
       Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.


Appellant's position


    6. Mrs Lanto said that she wanted the Appellant to come  here.  It  was
       implicit in what she was saying that she  agreed  with  the  Judge's
       analysis (paragraph [12] of the determination) that the grant of her
       indefinite leave to remain cast light  on  her  and  his  reasonable
       expectation that he would not stay beyond her leave.

Discussion

    7. The Respondent's decision was taken on 17  November  2014.  At  that
       date Mrs Lanto's leave to remain was due to  expire  on  31  January
       2015. The Appellant's visa application discloses that he applied  on
       1 November 2014 for leave to  enter  as  her  child  dependent,  she
       having leave to be in the United Kingdom as a  domestic  worker.  He
       intended to arrive on 15 November 2014 and come for 3 months, namely
       until 15 February 2015. By then her leave would have expired.


    8. Section 85 (5)(b) of the Nationality,  Immigration  and  Asylum  Act
       2002 is unambiguous.

          "(5)... in relation to  an  appeal  under  section  82(1)  against
          refusal of entry clearance ...-
          (a)...
          (b) the Tribunal may consider only the circumstances  appertaining
          at the time of the decision to refuse."


    9. The Judge's reason fell outside the  ambit  of  that  which  he  was
       allowed to consider. It is unclear where the Judge sought  authority
       for his analysis. The only case that may give a  hint  is  DR  (ECO:
       Post decision evidence) Morocco [2005] UKIAT 00038 which  guides  me
       to the view that a Judge is able to take post refusal evidence  into
       account if it  was  a  circumstance  appertaining  at  the  date  of
       decision  and  casts  light  on  the  validity   of   the   original
       information.  This  however   plainly   was   not   a   circumstance
       appertaining at the date of decision as the  subsequent  grant  post
       dated the Respondent's decision by 6 weeks. It did not cast light on
       their reasonable expectations.

   10. As there was no basis for the Judge's decision  to  take  subsequent
       evidence into account, I am satisfied  that  there  was  a  material
       error of law. I therefore set the decision aside.

   11. Both Mr Staunton and Mrs Lanto asked  me  to  determine  the  matter
       rather than remitting it to the First-tier Tribunal given  the  lack
       of disputed facts, and un-necessary delay that would  be  consequent
       on that course of action. I agreed that in all the circumstances  of
       the case, it was appropriate for me to do so.

Rehearing

   12. Mr Staunton submitted that the rules were not met at the time of the
       Respondent's decision. There  were  no  compassionate  circumstances
       that enabled me to consider the case outside the rules  (SSHD  v  SS
       (Congo) [2015] EWCA Civ 387).


   13. Mrs Lanto told me that she wants the Appellant to come here.  He  is
       17 ï¿½ years old and lives with his brother who is 16  years  old  and
       sister who is 13 years old.  They  live  in  a  house  in  the  same
       compound as Mr Lanto's sister and all go to  school.  The  Appellant
       can submit a fresh application which she would support. Mr Lanto  is
       in the United Kingdom.

Discussion

   14. The Appellant applied for leave to enter for  a  period  beyond  the
       leave that Mrs Lanto had been granted. His application was  to  come
       for 3 months from 14 November 2014 to 14  February  2015  which  was
       after Mrs Lanto's then leave expired on 31 January 2015. That was in
       breach of paragraph 197 (v) of the rules. The leave that was granted
       6 weeks after the Respondent's decision should  not  be  taken  into
       account for the reasons I have given above.


   15. I dismiss the appeal under the rules.


   16. There is nothing compelling such as  to  mean  I  can  consider  the
       application  outside  the  rules  for  the  following  inter-related
       reasons. The Appellant can reapply. He is  living  in  accommodation
       with his siblings in conditions his parents felt was appropriate for
       him when they came here. He goes to school. His aunt  lives  in  the
       same compound  and  can  support  him  as  required.  Whilst  it  is
       generally best for him to be with his parents, by way of summary  he
       can remain at school in a system  he  has  been  all  his  life  and
       inevitably has friends, it is not necessarily best  for  him  to  be
       separated from his siblings or aunt, he is in  a  country  where  he
       speaks the primary language and understands the culture,  and  there
       is no evidence of there being neglect or abuse, unmet  needs,  or  a
       lack of stable arrangements for his care.

   17. I accordingly dismiss the appeal.

Decision:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  involve  the
    making of a material error on a point of law.

      I set aside the decision.

          I remake the decision.

          I dismiss the appeal.
