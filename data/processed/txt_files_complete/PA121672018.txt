                                                                  Respondent


                        DETERMINATION AND REASONS (P)


    Pursuant to Rule 14 of the Tribunal Procedure  (Upper  Tribunal)  Rules
    2008 (SI 2008/269) I make an anonymity order. Unless the Upper Tribunal
    or a Court directs otherwise, no report of  these  proceedings  or  any
    form of publication thereof shall directly or indirectly  identify  the
    respondent in this determination  identified  as  GJO.  This  direction
    applies to, amongst others, all parties. Any  failure  to  comply  with
    this direction could give rise to contempt of court proceedings

      1. FtT Judge Colvin allowed GJO's appeal against the  refusal  of  his
         protection and human rights claim for reasons set out in a decision
         promulgated on 11th November 2019. Permission to appeal was granted
         by FtT judge Appleyard on 28th February 2020.  Directions  for  the
         further conduct of the appeal were sent on 29th April 2020 and,  in
         the circumstances surrounding COVID 19, provision was made for  the
         question of whether there was an error of law and if so whether the
         decision of the FtT Judge should be set aside to be  determined  on
         the papers.

      2. Neither party had complied with directions  by  the  date  of  this
         decision. Neither party had objected to a decision on the error  of
         law issue being taken on the papers. There was no Rule 24  response
         from the respondent.

      3.  In  the  absence  of  any  submissions  from  either  party  I  am
         nevertheless  satisfied that the grounds of appeal relied  upon  by
         the SSHD together with the papers before me that  were  before  the
         FtT judge are sufficient to enable me to take a decision on whether
         there is an error of law in the decision  of  the  FtT  and  if  so
         whether the decision should be set aside, on the papers and without
         hearing oral submissions.

         Background

      4. GJO, a Jamaican citizen born in1994, arrived in the UK in May  2007
         aged 12 with indefinite  leave  to  enter  following  a  successful
         appeal against a refusal of entry clearance. "No  time  limit'  was
         endorsed on his passport in December 2013. On 27th July 2017,  aged
         22 he was convicted of fraud, perverting the course of justice  and
         money laundering, such offences relating to  having  defrauded  his
         father of ï¿½1.2million. He was sentenced  to  a  total  of  5  years
         imprisonment. His claim to remain in the UK was based upon  threats
         he (and his mother and relatives) had received from his father (who
         has relocated to Jamaica) and others in the  community  because  of
         the fraud he committed.

         FtT decision

      5. The FtT Judge summarised GJO's claim and the  respondent's  reasons
         for refusal. She set out the evidence of the various witnesses  and
         summarised the submissions made. She set out the law. Her  findings
         were:

          i) GJO's account of his father making death threats  against  him
             are credible; that the threats are "very real  and  have  been
             made in full sincerity" [43].

         ii) The father has made  no  direct  threats  to  GJO  since  2014
             although it is reasonable to assume that he knows (or would be
             able to find out) that he had been living  with  his  maternal
             uncle prior to imprisonment and since his release.

        iii) There has been no reconciliation between the father and GJO.

         iv) "I am unable to say on the lower standard of proof that  there
             is no reasonable likelihood that the appellant will not be  at
             real risk from threats to kill him from his father in Jamaica"
             [46].

          v) GJO  is  "reasonably  likely  to  be  at  risk  of  not  being
             sufficiently protected by the Jamaican authorities and at  the
             same time  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  expect  him  to
             internally relocate in order to avoid detection by his father"
             [50].

         vi) The circumstances of his relationship with his girlfriend  and
             the consequences of his deportation do not meet the high  test
             of "unduly harsh".

        vii) GJO has been in the UK most of his life, he  remains  socially
             and culturally  integrated  in  the  UK;  he  meets  the  high
             threshold of very significant obstacles in terms of  the  real
             risk from death threat and, if wrong, the  adverse  impact  of
             his personal characteristics on his ability to participate and
             be accepted. He is at "real risk of death threats and "clearly
             meets the provision of 'very significant obstacles.

      6. The FtT judge dismissed the appeal on asylum grounds,  allowed  the
         appeal on humanitarian and human rights grounds.

         Error of law

      7. The SSHD sought and was granted permission on the  grounds  it  was
         arguable the judge had  failed  to  provide  adequate  reasons  for
         finding GJO had been subjected to threats against his life  by  his
         father;  failed  to  provide  adequate   reasons/gave   weight   to
         immaterial matters when finding GJO would currently be at risk from
         his father; made a material misdirection in law/failure to  provide
         adequate reasons on a material matter on internal relocation;  made
         a material  misdirection  on  a  material  matter  in  finding  the
         relationship with the maternal uncle was sufficient to  engage  the
         high threshold of very compelling circumstances - rehabilitation is
         a neutral point.

         Threats from GJO's father and internal relocation.

      8. The SSHD submits the judge wrongly concludes  that  there  were  no
         reasons advanced that undermined GJO's credibility. The SSHD  draws
         attention to the offences that he was  convicted  are  offences  of
         deception which undermine his  credibility;  that  she  incorrectly
         placed great reliance on the maternal uncle's evidence yet he had a
         vested interest in the outcome of the appeal and that  the  failure
         of GJO to notify the UK authorities of the threats  undermined  his
         credibility.  She  submits  that  the  likelihood  of  the  threats
         materialising should have been seen in the context  of  GJO's  last
         contact with his father and that the uncle's assessment of risk was
         incapable of being afforded the weight given to  it.  GJO's  father
         has, it was submitted received the majority of the money  that  was
         taken from him by GJO, there are still assets to be sold  and  that
         is clearly relevant given the  absence  of  recent  threats.  GJO's
         evidence was deficient it was submitted, and the FtT  judge  failed
         to approach the evidence with the necessary realism  and  attention
         to fact.

      9. The FtT judge does not, contrary to the  submission  by  the  SSHD,
         find that the SSHD failed  to  advance  reasons  to  counter  GJO's
         evidence; she finds that the reasons given by  the  SSHD  "are  not
         substantive in order to counter the appellant's  evidence  and  has
         not pointed to any other matters which in  my  view  undermine  the
         appellant's credibility on this point of threats" [43].  The  judge
         heard live oral evidence; she set that against the  other  evidence
         before her and reached the conclusion that  GJOs  father  had  made
         threats against him. The judge noted  that  the  threats  had  been
         notified to the police by one of the witnesses, but no  action  was
         taken. The judge's  assessment  of  the  uncle's  evidence  was  an
         assessment that was open to her. The submission that the uncle  had
         a vested interest in the outcome of the appeal is an interest  that
         is taken by most witnesses in nearly all appeals -  otherwise  they
         would not be called as witnesses.  To  imply  that  an  experienced
         judge such as this judge was not able to or failed to  factor  into
         her  assessment  the  purpose  that  witnesses  give  evidence   is
         surprising. There is no indication in the decision that  the  judge
         failed to make a proper and full assessment of the uncle's evidence
         in the context of the appeal before her.

     10. The judge clearly understood that it was not simply a  question  of
         whether the threats had occurred in the past but whether they  were
         likely to occur in the future such that GJO would be at real  risk.
         The judge was clearly aware  of  the  difficulties  of  reaching  a
         decision and considered the whole of the evidence  holistically  in
         making her decision. Her findings were open to her on the evidence;
         she  has  not  omitted  consideration  of  evidence   and   plainly
         acknowledges the difficulty in making the decision in  the  context
         of the weighty public interest in deportation.

     11. In reaching her decision on sufficiency of protection and  internal
         relocation, the judge took full account of the evidence before her.
         She refers to the background evidence and cites this with  provisos
         with regard to the threats coming from an individual family member.
         Her conclusions are not speculative but informed  by  the  evidence
         before her which she carefully considered and analysed. Again,  she
         acknowledges the difficulty of the decision she has  to  make,  but
         reaches a decision that is supported by her reasoning.

         Very compelling circumstances

     12. As observed by the judge, given her  findings  as  to  humanitarian
         protection  there  was  no  necessity  to   consider   Article   8.
         Nevertheless, she makes a full analysis both of GJO's relationships
         and his  personal  private  life  impacted  upon  by  the  findings
         regarding death  threats.  The  relationship  with  his  uncle  and
         rehabilitation are merely factors that she takes into  account  and
         do not form the basis on which she finds there are very  compelling
         circumstances.




    Conclusion

     13. The decision reached by this  judge  in  this  case  is  perhaps  a
         decision that may not have been reached by another judge. It cannot
         be said however  that  her  findings  were  defective,  unreasoned,
         lacked detail or unjustified. She set out the evidence and  applied
         the law properly. Her decision is structured and reached after very
         careful consideration and analysis. The submissions by the SSHD  in
         the grounds seeking permission to appeal are disagreements with the
         judge's findings; findings she was entitled to come to even if  not
         all would agree with them. There is no error  of  law  in  the  FtT
         Judge's decision.




    Conclusions:

    The making of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal did  not  involve
    the making of an error on a point of law.

    I do not set aside the decision; the decision of the FtT judge allowing
    the appeal stands.




    Anonymity

    The First-tier Tribunal made an  order  pursuant  to  rule  13  of  the
    Tribunal  Procedure  (First-tier  Tribunal)  (Immigration  and   Asylum
    Chamber) Rules 2014.

    I continue that order (pursuant to rule 14 of  the  Tribunal  Procedure
    (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008).
