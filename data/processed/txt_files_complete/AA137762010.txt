For the Appellant:  Mr P Lewis, Counsel.
For the Respondent: Ms Everett, HOPO

                          DETERMINATION AND REASONS


   1. There is a lengthy history to this matter.
   2. The appellant is a citizen of Zimbabwe born on  14  August  1960.  She
      arrived in the UK on the 31st of May 2000 and  was  granted  leave  to
      enter as a visitor. Thereafter she sought to remain as a  student  but
      her application was refused  on  31  October  2002.  She  subsequently
      overstayed.
   3. On 4th August 2008 she made an asylum application  which  was  refused
      and her appeal was dismissed in  October  2008  by  immigration  Judge
      Broe. A High Court review lead to a reconsideration hearing,  but  her
      appeal was dismissed on 3 March 2009 by senior immigration judge Warr.
      Further representations were made by her solicitors and on 20 May 2010
      a fresh claim was made and again  refused.  The  appeal  against  that
      decision was dismissed by immigration judge Ford on 5  November  2010.
      On 9 May 2011 Senior Immigration Judge Kekic found no error of law  in
      that decision.
   4. The appellant appealed to the  Court  of  Appeal  and  was  ultimately
      granted permission by Laws LJ on the grounds that successive decisions
      of the tribunal were at least in part procured  by  wrong  information
      provided by the Secretary of State whose position  had  been  that  no
      claim for asylum had been made until 2008. It was  now  accepted  that
      there had in fact been such a claim in 2001.
   5. On 10 September 2012 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal in so  far
      as it was remitted to  the  Upper  Tribunal  (Immigration  and  Asylum
      Chamber) for reconsideration.
   6. Both parties agreed that the proper course should be for the appeal to
      be reheard by a differently constituted first-tier  tribunal,  not  to
      include Judges Broe, Ford, Warr or Kekic.
