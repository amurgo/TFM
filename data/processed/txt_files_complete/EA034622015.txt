               THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT
                                                                  Respondent


Representation:
For the Appellant:     Mr. S. Ahmed, Counsel, instructed by 12 Bridge
Solicitors
For the Respondent:    Mr. P. Duffy, Home Office Presenting Officer


                            DECISION AND REASONS

  1. This is an appeal by the Appellant against the decision  of  First-tier
     Tribunal Judge Fitzgibbon QC, promulgated on 7 April 2017, in which  he
     found that there was no jurisdiction for  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to
     hear the Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse
     his application under the EEA Regulations for a residence  card  as  an
     extended family member.


 2. Permission to appeal was granted as the Judge had applied the  case  of
    Sala (EFMs: Right of Appeal) [2016] UKUT 00411 (IAC), which  has  since
    been overturned by  the  Court  of  Appeal.   There  was  therefore  an
    arguable error of law.


 3. I  heard  submissions  from  both  representatives  following  which  I
    announced that the decision involved the making of a material error  of
    law.


Submissions


 4. Mr. Duffy submitted that the Respondent had been granted a stay in  the
    case of Khan [2017] EWCA Civ 1755.  He provided a copy of an order from
    the Court of Appeal dated 9 November 2017 refusing permission to appeal
    to the  Court  of  Appeal,  but  staying  its  directions  pending  the
    determination of a renewed permission to appeal.  Mr.  Duffy  submitted
    that the Appellant's case should be  stayed  until  the  Supreme  Court
    decision in Khan.


 5. Mr. Ahmed submitted that the stay  prevented  the  First-tier  Tribunal
    from making findings, but that an appropriate way forward would  be  to
    find an error of law in accordance with the case of Khan and remit  the
    appeal to the First-tier Tribunal.  In that way, the Appellant would be
    one step further, and if the Respondent was not granted  permission  to
    appeal to the Supreme Court, the appeal could proceed to  be  heard  in
    the First-tier Tribunal.


Error of law


 6. Lord Justice Longmore, agreeing with the decision of Lord Justice Irwin
    in the case of Khan stated as follows, [48] to [50]:


    "It is a cornerstone of the  rule  of  law  that  discretionary  powers
    conferred on Ministers of the Crown are not to be used arbitrarily  and
    that, if an exercise of power is exercised otherwise than in accordance
    with the correct legal principles, it will be quashed by the courts.  A
    litigant who is the subject of such a decision has an entitlement to an
    adjudication to that effect; at the  very  least,  a  decision  by  the
    Secretary of State not to issue a residence card is  a  decision  which
    "concerns ... a Judgment Approved by the court for handing down. Khan v
    SSHD person's entitlement to be issued with ... a ...  residence  card"
    even if it is a decision taken in pursuance of a  discretion  conferred
    on the Secretary of State.


    As Lord Halsbury LC famously said in Sharpe v Wakefield Justices [1891]
    A.C. 173, 179:-


         "... and "discretion" means when it is said that something is to be
         done within the discretion of the authorities, that that  something
         is to be done according to the rules of  reason  and  justice,  not
         according to  private  opinion  ...;  according  to  law,  and  not
         humour..."  If  "that  something"  is  a  decision  which  is   not
         "according to law" a claimant has an entitlement to relief  or,  at
         the very least, that  decision  is  a  decision  that  concerns  an
         entitlement to the object sought to be obtained - here a  residence
         card.


    As such, the  Secretary  of  State's  decision  to  refuse  Mr  Khan  a
    residence card, is, in my view, an EEA decision and  can  therefore  be
    appealed in the ordinary way to the First Tier Tribunal."


 7. I find that, following the case of Khan, which overturned the  case  of
    Sala, jurisdiction lies  with  the  First-tier  Tribunal  to  hear  the
    Appellant's appeal against the Respondent's decision to refuse to grant
    a residence card as the extended family  member  of  an  EEA  national.
    Therefore there is a valid appeal.


Decision


  8. The decision of the  First-tier  Tribunal  involves  the  making  of  a
     material error of law, and I set the decision aside.


  9. The appeal is remitted to the First-tier Tribunal to be reheard.


 10. Following the order of the Court of Appeal staying the remittal of Khan
     to the First-tier Tribunal, this remittal will also be  stayed  pending
     the Respondent's renewed application for permission to  appeal  to  the
     Supreme Court.


 11. No anonymity direction is made.

Deputy Upper Tribunal Judge Chamberlain
Application for a Costs Order

    1. Mr. Ahmed stated that he wished to apply  for  "wasted  costs".   He
       submitted that the Appellant had been successful.  The Tribunal  had
       concurred with the position of the Court of Appeal.  A  fuller  Rule
       24  response  may  have  enlightened  the  Appellant   as   to   the
       Respondent's  position.   Counsel's  costs  of  ï¿½400  plus  VAT  for
       attendance at the hearing today should be awarded.

    2. Mr. Duffy responded that a wasted costs order  could  only  be  made
       against  the  Presenting  Officer  in  the  case  of   unreasonable,
       vexatious or harassing  conduct.   The  conduct  of  the  Presenting
       Officer  had  been  none  of  these  and  a  costs  order  was   not
       appropriate.  He referred to the case of Cancino (costs - First-tier
       Tribunal - new powers) [2015] UKFTT 00059 (IAC).


    3. I have carefully considered Mr. Ahmed's application,  together  with
       the case of Cancino (costs - First-tier Tribunal - new  powers).   I
       find that is in inappropriate to  make  an  order  for  costs.   The
       conduct of the Presenting Officer was not unreasonable.  The  matter
       is clearly not settled given that the Respondent has made a  renewed
       application to appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal in
       Khan.  The Presenting Officer drew the Tribunal's attention  to  the
       order of the Court of Appeal in Khan  and  did  not  object  to  the
       approach proposed by Mr. Ahmed.  In the  circumstances,  I  make  no
       order for costs.


Signed                                  Date 19 January 2018
